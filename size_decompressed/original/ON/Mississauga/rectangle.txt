Two building-sized shapes floating slowly west to east along Lake Ontario waterfront south of Hurontario. Oct 29, 1:30pm, 2015;2015-10-29 13:30:00;10 minutes;Two building-sized shapes floating slowly west to east along Lake Ontario waterfront south of Hurontario. Oct 29, 1:30pm, 2015 I was travelling to an interview at Burnhamthorpe Rd./Hurontario Rd..  I had this in my calendar and can confirm time and date. I was travelling from Mississauga/401 area south-east for an interview at Burnhamthorpe and Hurontario rds.  For some of the trip I had a high vantage point and saw clear down to Lake Ontario.  I saw two rectangular shapes moving slowly from west to east.  They seemed to follow the lake front. They were higher than buildings, so perhaps 40-100 stories or higher in the air.  They were the size of 6 story buildings.. very large rectangles in comparison to nearby buildings.  I watched carefully but I could not see any airplanes or helicopters that would be pulling them.  They flew in formation, very slowly.  I watched as they flew from directly south in line with Hurontario, to perhaps Long Branch.  They were dark, perhaps black.  There was a slight cutout on the right (West) edge, starting at mid-height, going down to the bottom-right corner of the rectangle.  Both shapes had the same thin cutout.  I can provide drawing if needed.;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
Two dark rectangle floating semi sized containers in Mississauga near Square One;2015-11-30 13:30:00;20 seconds;Two dark rectangle floating semi sized containers in Mississauga near Square One Today, Nov 30, 2015, in Mississauga, Ontario.  Saw a square floating rectangle for two seconds heading North West.  It floated toward building and went behind.  I was southbound on Hurontario and stopped in my van by square one.  I looked around to see if anyone else seen it.  I looked for power lines.  It had been way above.  I looked for cranes.  None.  It was about 10 stories up, and grey/black.  It was I can only assume ... the size of a semi truck.  No lights.  No noise.  Time was around 1:30pm.  As I was processing what I saw...another came.  Exact same path.  Same look. Same speed.. Disappeared behind building just the same.  I can not explain or process what I saw.  I didn't see a helicopter carrying this.  Just a big dark rectangular box.  Followed 20 seconds later by another???  I watched the skies the rest of the day...nothing.;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
