Object enveloped by storm cloud;2001-07-28 09:30:00;10 minutes;Object enveloped by storm cloud I was looking out my window (I live on the 15th floor of a highrise - facing eastward towards the CN Tower) under extreme clear skies.  I noticed an object (circular) rising from behinds the 10th story of the buiding across the street.  The object was the size of a satellite dish. It flew parallel to the ground before making a sharp turn eastward and climb. The coating of the object flickered from opaque to mirror-like. It climbed sharply but steadily. All of a sudden, a huge cloud seemed to form over a distance of 20 miles (dist. from my home to the CN Tower)very quickly. It enveloped the object. I must have looked down for a few seconds when I looked up the storm cloud had dissipated taking the object with it.  The whole incident took approximately 10 minutes.

It seemed very far away because I could see a plane flying towards it and the plane was definately lower since I could see the plane more clearly.   The object was a small circle in size with only 1 bright light..unlike the plane which you can see has 2 lights on the wings and 1 at the rear at all times.   The object flew southeast very slowly, hovered for about 2 minutes and then zoomed off at an amazing speed in the direction of north west of where it was currently..almost creating a check like trail ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
