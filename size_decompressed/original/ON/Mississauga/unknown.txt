Approx 17 orange lights in triangular pattern;2009-07-31 23:45:00;20-25 seconds;Approx 17 orange lights in triangular pattern Last night my husband and I were out in our pool for a late night swim. It was a cloudless night and the stars were out. We had our lights all turned off to enjoy the night sky. We had come out around 11:35 pm and had been in the pool about five to ten minutes when I noticed lights in the sky coming over the house behind us.  At first I thought it was a plane, because our house is in a flight path. They were in a distinct triangular shape that in some ways mimicked that of a fighter jet's elongated triangle--  but the lights made a triangular shape that was bigger than a plane, you could see sky through and around them. They were small orange points of light, and looked extraordinarily similar to the smallest stars we could see in the sky except of course that they were moving, and fast, flying in what appeared almost like a perfect flock of geese formation, except with two rows instead of one. I instantly pointed them out to my husband and we watched them as they passed almost directly overhead and past our house from Northwest to Southeast. There was no sound whatsoever either before, during or after they passed, other than that of the usual street traffic nearby, etc. Once we realized they were separate lights and not a single plane, I was honestly afraid they might  be missiles of some kind, because they were so small and high and going so fast,  their color was so uniform, and there was no sound.  Honestly, I have no idea whether missiles make noise or not, but it's all my mind could come up with at the time.   Also as they passed one of the tiny dots of light moved out of the V formation and away and then back into it.   They continued on in their straight path until they disappeared over the roof of our house. The whole thing only lasted 20-25 seconds or so traveling from the horizon of one rooftop to the horizon of the opposite rooftop. There seems to me to be absolutely no question that what we saw was not a natural event, but a group of-- I have no idea what. I am completely at a loss. But those orange lights were most definitely in a formation, and wherever they were going, they were going fast. I have never reported anything like this before in my life until today. Would love to know what it was we saw.;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
White lights in the morning sky over Lake Ontario.;2013-06-05 05:45:00;30 seconds;White lights in the morning sky over Lake Ontario. There was a single light behind thin cloud cover, headed north towards Toronto airport that caught my attention when it broke into five lights drifting away from one another but continuing north, and then forming a fairly tight &quotV&quot formation before disappearing from sight behind cloud cover. Was not able to see shape or size, just lights.  One single white light each. There was no noise associated with this event.  After watching the sky for several more minutes, there was no recurrence.;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
