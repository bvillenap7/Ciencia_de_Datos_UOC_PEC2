A very faint V shape air craft flying south in Mississauga at about 10:30 pm.;2012-05-20 22:30:00;2 min;A very faint V shape air craft flying south in Mississauga at about 10:30 pm. We were watching fireworks on our street we decided to take out our telescope along with our neighbor to watch the planets and stars.  My brother first noticed something flying in a V formation south and asked me what that was.  It was very faint, no flashing lights.  To me it looked like a flock of bird with the city lights below them.  However my husband said that it was flying in a perfect formation so it couldnâ€™t be birds.  There was no sound either.  It lasted about 2 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
