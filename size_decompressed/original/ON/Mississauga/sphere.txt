A bright metallic object in the shape of what appeared to be a sphere was spotted flying across the sky in the Woodlands area of Mississauga. The object was about the size of a golf ball held at arms length. The object appeared to be silver in colour and was reflecting sunlight off of it. The object travelled from south to north and simply disappeared in the blink of an eye.;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
Spherical bright glowing craft moves out over Lake Ontario, stops, Comes closer to us, then takes off in the opposite direction...;2009-05-25 22:00:00;2 mins;Spherical bright glowing craft moves out over Lake Ontario, stops, Comes closer to us, then takes off in the opposite direction... While standing at the shores of Lake Ontario in the suburb of Toronto, Mississauga, myself and 3 friends witnessed a strange ufo at roughly 10pm est. I was the first to notice the craft, which started over the land, and proceeded to fly out over the lake. I could not tell exactly how far away it was, nor how fast it was going, because I have never seen anything like this is the sky before. The craft seemed to be spherical or circular, and was the brightest a biggest thing in the sky by far. It was also completely silent. It proceeded to fly out over the water and after a bit, it seemed to stop. What happened next I still am not to sure of, because once again this is not an everyday thing...The craft began to glow brighter and bigger. I'm not sure whether it was stationary and just glowing more intensely, or if it was coming directly towards us. After about 10 seconds of this, the craft took off in the exact opposite direction, simply fading away and disappearing over the course of about 15 seconds. I have been intensely researching ufo's and other related topics for the past couple of months. This is what perhaps makes it even weirder for myself. I have been trying increasingly to get the particular friends I was with on the night to do their own research. And just randomly, they are the ones who are with me when this happens. We all know what we saw that night, and we embrace it.;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
Orbs by Lake Ontario.;2013-10-07 19:00:00;10 minutes;Orbs by Lake Ontario My friend called me into the living room and told me that she had seen orbs fly over the tree behind our house.  We sat and waited, and soon another orb flew into view and seemed to fly behind us.  After a few minutes, another appeared from that direction and flew quickly in a wavy way, up and down, back over the houses, and a light in the center seemed to get brighter.  This orb was soon followed by three more, one at a time.  They almost looked like they were racing one another.  When I saw the first one, I thought it was only an object in the wind, but the others that followed were being guided by more than the wind. I'm unsure of how many there were because they could have doubled back.  There were at least four. They were white-grey, possibly silver. These moved faster and in formations that I have never seen a plane or helicopter do.  This is the first experience I've had where I have absolutely no idea what it was that my friend and I saw. Although I have always had a curiosity to see a UFO, my friend is a cynic.  She is sure that what we saw could only be classified as a group of UFOs.;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
