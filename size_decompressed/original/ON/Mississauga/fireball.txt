We came out of a clothing store on Mavis Road in the north part of Mississauga, my son my wife and my sons friend, were getting into ou;2002-02-12 19:40:00;15secs;We came out of a clothing store on Mavis Road in the north part of Mississauga, my son my wife and my sons friend, were getting into our car when we all (except my wife who was already entered the car) saw an amazingly bright green/blue fireball. It dropped for about 15 seconds from what must have been a great height. It caught our attention because at first it was so small (a pin prick of light) yet amazingly bright, as it dropped/ moved downwards it got bigger and very much brighter, it hurt your eyes to look at it. We were almost under the approach path to Toronto Intl. planes were stacked up in a line approaching the airport, this was much higher than the planes. Ultimately it became a bit bigger than the size of a dime at arms length. It dropped from a height of about 80 degrees to approx 30 degrees in a spastic jerking manner, this took from 12 to 18 seconds. This was not a firework or a flare, the colour was truly very odd, just before it disappeared it moved/jeked sideways and flashed a blindingly bright orange colour, then nothing. We discussed it amongst ourselves afterwards and feel it must have been something burning up as it entered the atmosphere, but as to why it should jerk around and twitch as it fell, we can only speculate;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
fireball-like objects blue, red and green seemed to form triagular pattern in the sky.;2002-02-17 23:45:00;several minutes;fireball-like objects blue, red and green seemed to form triagular pattern in the sky. Myself and three friends late Sunday evening decided to go outside in the backyard for a cigarette when we noticed a strange sky. It appeared to be a full or almost full moon out, but there was a strange circle around the moon. It had a glow around the circle, I am not much of an astronomer but I believe it was a lunar eclipse, the moon was very bright and seemed to be right in the middle of the circle which had a glowing haze around it. One of my friends had a digital camera and decided to take some pictures. That is when we noticed these small round objects in the photos. They were different in colour, blue red and green. She took several photos and we noticed a few of these fireball-like objects had formed a triangular pattern. We stared into the night sky at them for a few minutes. It was late and dark and to be honest we were all a little frightened by the sighting and went inside. I am expecting to receive the photographic evidence anyday now via e-mail and will post them a.s.a.p., I will remain anonymous until after I post the pictures at which time I will make myself available for any questioning. ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous to us, so we cannot request copies of the photos.  The ring around the Moon is suggestive of high altitude moisture or ice crystals.  The lighted objects may be twinkling stars, but that is a guess.  PD));43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
Large fiery meteor-like entry;2003-10-13 07:00:00;3 minutes;Large fiery meteor-like entry My wife was travelling to the gym when a red fiery object broke through the cloud layer.  My wife described the object as being a red-orange fireball, with a noticable smoke trail.  The object descended from a height of approximately 15,000-20,000 feet.  The object descended for a period of about two minutes while she drove to the health club.  She parked the car and went into the health club and brought out an attendant to witness the object.  The object was visible for another ten seconds before it went behind the tree line.  The impact point would likely have been Lake Ontario. No impact sound or vibration was felt by either witness. I showed my wife the picture of the recent UK fireball and she attests that her sighting was identical. ((NUFORC Note:  The object almost certainly was not a meteor, if, in fact, the witness observed the object for 3 minutes.  Our next guess would be that she witnessed a high-altitude contrail, which was brightly illuminated by the rising sun.  PD));43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
Orange type fire object, heading towards the earth at obscure angle very far away.;2004-03-09 18:10:00;four seconds;Orange type fire object, heading towards the earth at obscure angle very far away. Just tonight, me and my friend John were pulling into sobeys to get milk. I parked the car(being the driver, John directly beside me in the passenger and no one else)I glanced upwards and over timhortons. It was obvious to us the object was very far away(km or miles unknown). I saw a bright orange fire type object heading towards the earth at a very obscure angle. I quicky pointed it out to John who saw it right away. It Definenty was not a plane going in for a smooth landing, but perhaps a plane crashing. Me and John were both shocked and had no explanation. The object was going too slowly to be a meteriod. It went as quickly as it came and in seconds was out of sight under timhortons.;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343

Orange fireball floating horizontally in the sky.;2012-08-05 22:05:00;30 seconds;Orange fireball floating horizontally in the sky We were standing outside, and we saw 2 fireball looking objects floating horizontally across the sky. They were going slowly so we knew it wasn't a plane on fire or something similar. They were in the sky longer than 30 seconds but trees blocked our view.
