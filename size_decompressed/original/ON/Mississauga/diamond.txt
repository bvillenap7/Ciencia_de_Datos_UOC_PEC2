It traveled at a very high rate of speed in a straight line below the clouds. There were no flashing lights, exhaust trail, or any noise. It appeared from the East, traveling Westbound. I have a security camera but it did not see the object it just recorded me looking at the object for 8 seconds until it disappeared over the Western horizon. I do not know of any man made flying craft that can fly that fast with no sound.;43.587655128205;-79.6713441880343
