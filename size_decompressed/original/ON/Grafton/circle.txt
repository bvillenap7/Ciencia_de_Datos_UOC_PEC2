I was in my hot tub and I was looking at the stars then I saw a flash, it was just a plane so I watched it fly for a bit but then I saw a green flash near a tree, I didn’t see it for 30 seconds. After these 30 seconds I saw it fly out from behind the tree and it was higher than the plane was. It continued to fly from where it and the plane were to where I first saw the plane at least three times faster than the plane did, it continued to go straight until it turned right and I couldn’t see it because my house blocked it.  The second one. It’s now been around two minutes from when I lost sight of the first one and I saw another green flash. This green circle looked the same as the first one but it was farther away than the first one I saw, from there it went to where I saw the first one and then straight to where the first one turned but instead of turning it continued to go straight and I eventually lost it in the distance.  I then double checked to see if I was seeing things by looking at other stars to see if they would start moving, but they didn’t.;44.0029;-78.0149
