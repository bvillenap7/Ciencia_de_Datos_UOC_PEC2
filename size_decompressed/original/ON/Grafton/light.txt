Approx 22:30hrs  in the west sky we noticed a bright light moving toward us.At first we thought it was a plane as we are in a heavy flight path.Then it slowed & started to zig zag, stop, go up come forward & zig zag then up on a 45 degree angle. It disappeared for 30 seconds & appeared again zigged & gone. It was maybe a mile away if that. We heard & watched 4 planes fly over while this happened.;44.0029;-78.0149
