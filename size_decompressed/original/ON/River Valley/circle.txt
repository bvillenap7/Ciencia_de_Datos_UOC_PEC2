I followed her out the front door and once outside on the front deck, she pointed up to the sky and asked me if I was seeing that?  I looked up and observe a number of red lights travelling through the sky.  From our location, they were lined up with the big dipper and we're traveling from south to north.  I counted at least 5.   They appeared to be traveling in formation at the same rate of speed.  I ran into the house to grab my phone and grab a photo or video.  I was only gone for 10 to 15 seconds.  When I came back out, there where only a couple left but I watched one disappear as I was trying to video.  I was able to capture the last one before it disappeared.   They did not look like any airplanes or satellites I have seen in the sky in the past.;46.586;-80.1864
