tracking orb.;2020-05-16 23:30:00;4 minutes;tracking orb Summer 2018, we were having a family reunion and I went down to the river alone around 7 pm to swim and when in the middle of the river noticed this orb in the sky tracking towards me on a 45 angle- it scared the crap out of me and I swam back to shore grabbed a towel and my clothes and it started tracking off on a steeper angle away from me and quickly and disappeared as I ran back to the house. I was freaking out and everyone was telling me I saw a drone. It was a bright light orb no sound with an x in it with this slow steady encroaching vibe? May 16, 2020 repeat appearance 11 pm I was laying in bed with a skylight to my right and saw a falling star and said oh that's nice then this straight gold bar of light shot into the sky and turned into a bright gold light tracking away from my house but very high up and far away in a clear night sky so I decided to stand in my skylight to look at it because it was so weird before I knew it it was another orb like the one in the river tracking straight towards me centered on the skylight. I watched it track towards me bright glowing orb no x in it but some line in it also highlighted with light? I freaked out again when it was 200m off and stepped out of the skylight turned on my cell to take a pic but it was gone when I stepped back. Then I wondered if I shouldn't have stepped away and should be braver when these things approach me?;46.3197;-78.6988
