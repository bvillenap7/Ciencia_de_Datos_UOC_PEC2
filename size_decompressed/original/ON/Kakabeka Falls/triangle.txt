Orange/red objects hovering in the moonlit night sky in rural Thunder Bay.;2015-01-01 01:00:00;8 minutes;Orange/red objects hovering in the moonlit night sky in rural Thunder Bay. My wife awoke me to witness three flying objects in the sky south east of our home.  They were flying at around 500 ft +/_  , flying at first in formation then one branched off while the other two sort of hovered in a general area of the night sky.  These objects were red and slightly orange in colour.   They began to move east away from our home towards Thunder Bay and all at once just vanished into thin air, one minute I was watching them, and I turned to my wife for a split second, and when I looked back out to the sky they were gone.;48.4167;-89.6167
