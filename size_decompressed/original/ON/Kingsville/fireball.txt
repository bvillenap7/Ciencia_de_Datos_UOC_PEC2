2 fireball type objects flying west to east over Lake Erie.;2012-06-29 22:30:00;1 minute;2 fireball type objects flying west to east over Lake Erie. June 29 2012 at around 22:30, I saw two fireball type objects flying west to east over Lake Erie from my home in Kingsville, Ontario.  They were flying about as fast as a regular aircraft and were going the same direction as the wind.  They were not very high, probably as high as most helicopters fly over the water.  The two objects were only a few seconds apart and I could see them both at the same time. The first one stayed a constant orange colour, but the second one was randomly changing colour from orange to red.  They did not make any sound, and they did not change direction.  I watched them for about a minuet before they went behind some trees.  There was one aircraft present, it was higher in the sky and further away. There was also a sighting in Leamington, Ontario (just east of Kingsville) on June 23 2012, and the man took a picture:   http://www.theweathernetwork.com/your_weather/details/620/6800080/5/caon0350/plpcities/787/&#commentposition   His picture looks just like the two I saw.;42.0463;-82.7587
