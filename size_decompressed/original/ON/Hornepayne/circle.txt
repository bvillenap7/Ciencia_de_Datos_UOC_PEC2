Moonlit night.;2003-08-08 21:00:00;5 min;3 round  white illuminated objects travelling in V formation, changin to line then back to V. Moonlit night. full moon evening,partial clouds, I spotted 3 round objects similar to cotton balls, like fuzzy extra large stars, but not as bright as a star, travelling in east/west direction in the eastern sky. From ground to centre of sky, it would be in the 10am position. They appeared to be illuminated by the moon. When first observed, they were in V formation, one in front, two behind. they then formed a line one behind the other for a while and then reformed into a V and then disappeared behind some clouds. That was the last I saw of them.There was no sound.They were travelling at a rate of speed similar to a satellite in orbit or a high flying jet.
