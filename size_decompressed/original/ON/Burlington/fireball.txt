Fireball in sky.;2012-11-09 21:00:00;1 minute;Fireball in sky On Friday November 9, 2012 at approx. 21:00 hours, I was outside checking my hot tub. I was distracted by a light in the sky and saw what looked to be an airplane on fire.  After about 30 seconds the fire glow disappeared and it appeared like a normal airplane traveling before I lost sight over the house and trees.   At first I thought it may have been a satellite but did notice there was cloud in the sky and did not see any stars.  The movement was approx. from a NW to SE direction and I would have been looking NE;43.3744155893536;-79.8204209125475
