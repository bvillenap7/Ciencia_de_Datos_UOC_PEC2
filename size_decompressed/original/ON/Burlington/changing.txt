I live about 3/4 of a Kilometre north of Lake Ontario in Burlington, Ontario.  I was sitting on my balcony playing a new song I have written on my guitar.  My balcony faces south.  I looked to my left(south east) and out of nowhere appeared to be a hazey sphere that I mistook for the moon for a second.  It then got larger and larger and a light appeared in the middle of it.  I stopped and fixated on it.  I told myself it must be a helicopter looking for pot crops or something but it then burned so bright that my eyes hurt and I had to look away.  It was very close to a star of which I don't know the name and I used the star as a marker to see how much it moved. It dimmed out to a cigar shaped haze and zigg zagged a little and then started to glow in the middle and had a haze on top and below the glow. It looked like a star if you were to glance at it quick.  Obviously they have this way of camoflouge(hope I spelled it right) it can trick your eye.  I looked at this thing and could not believe I was seeing it so plain.  I woke my 66 year old father at 4 in the morning to have a witness. He calmly told me he had seen one as a little boy and I should keep watching because I will take off really really fast. I then discovered another one more to the direct east glowing on and off.  That is the thing.  It glowed on and off. It disappeared and then reappeared about 15 times approx.  Totally amazing.  I have never had any doubt that there are entities out there but this is an affirmation. It hovered in the relative same spot for nearly 2 hours glowing on and off and slowly moving around.  If this was man-made then the man who made it is a trillionaire and will not let anyone in on his or her secret. Howard Hughes eat your heart out.  This was real, real, real, real. It disappeared behind dark clouds as did the other at the same time.  Signed: Never The Same Again, Burlington, Ontario;43.3744155893536;-79.8204209125475
