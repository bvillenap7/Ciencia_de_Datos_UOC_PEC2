Not clear if it was solid object or spokes like a T.   Object arrived from the northeast and was moving in a southwesterly direction over Lake Erie.  Lights were diffuse - not bright points like stars.  Moving quite rapidly and appeared quite large.  Did seem to block out stars as it moved but it didn't last long.  It moved in a very straight - no curvature to flight path.  No evidence of movement whatsoever.  Completely silent.  What did we see?;43.3744155893536;-79.8204209125475
