A hexagon shaped bright white object with a black stripe and three red dots acoross it moving at insane speeds.;1997-08-10 21:14:00;10 seconds;A hexagon shaped bright white object with a black stripe and three red dots acoross it moving at insane speeds. This report is so old because i have only found this website recently. I was looking out my window and i could clearly see an object moving at high speeds in the sky. The object was shaped like a hexagon, and was a bright white on the top and bottem. In the middle, along its width, appeared to be either nothing or a black stripe. I say it looked liek nothing because it was at night and it may have been sky. Along the black stripe were three bright red dots, or lights. The next day, i heard on the radio that many others had seen what I saw, as well as a green dot moving rapidly and eraticaly across the sky, and that i did not see. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know whether the witness means a date of August 10, 1997, or October 08, 1997.  We presume the former.  Report is from an anonymous source.

Flickering tight cluster in the wnw in Southern Ontario.;2014-07-10 01:00:00;Current;Flickering tight cluster in the wnw in Southern Ontario. Looking to the wnw and slightly up I see a tight cluster that looks like meteor showers.   My app will not read it and it is flickering, seems to separate, very much like the aquarids but again, my app does not read it.   I watched it for almost an hour.  It does not seem to be travelling but is active. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.3744155893536;-79.8204209125475
