We could not explain it  !!;1995-06-21 22:40:00;5Min;We could not explain it  !! I lived on the 19th floor of an apartment building, myself & two others were enjoying the view on my belcony when I saw 3 red lights in the formation of a triangle moving without sound from the East right past us at about 500 to 1000 feet.As a private pilot I have an idea of altitude & speed through the air.It looked to be moving at around 100 to 150 kts.The three red lights went past us about 200 to 1000ft away from the building then turned to the North.But they turned as if they were one object maintaining this shape all the way.& they made the turn flat not banked like an aircraft would. I said to my two friends do you see that? They didn't at first untill I pointed right at it as it past by us.Then they said yes we see it.We could see the stars in the sky in between them, they apeard to be three seperet objects but they moved at the exact same time & speed as they turned & they keped the same distance from each other.As they headed North they apeared to pick up speed to what looked like over 300 kts & faded as they got farther away.That night it was calm and clear skies.They again made no sound,no wind from passing us & no exsaust of any kind.It was not something we could explain & it gave me goose bumps. I found it to be more fastinating then scary. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD));43.3744155893536;-79.8204209125475

From my apartment balcony I first saw what appeared to be a falling star. This was followed by about 5 more identical objects moving on exactly the same trajectory.  I went to retrieve my movie camera and upon returning these objects were no longer visible.  About 30 seconds later I filmed a 15 second clip of what initially appeared to be a star, which then began moving at great speed over an extremely erratic pattern that covered a great distance.;43.3744155893536;-79.8204209125475

It was difficult to discern a shape for the lights, but each was visible for about 3 seconds, then disappeared, afterwhich another one appeared, travelled along the falling star trajectory, then disappeared.   I went to search for my camera and when I finally found it, these shapes we're no longer appearing.  I focused the camera in the general vicinity where we saw the observation and noticed a bright light that was far up in the sky...possibly near the stars.  It was moving erratically and rapidly...travelling across the field of view of several stars in only seconds and changing direction rapidly. I captured this observation on videotape.;43.3744155893536;-79.8204209125475
starlike objects seen over lowville. Third incident among my group of friends;2004-07-29 03:36:00;4 hours;starlike objects seen over lowville. Third incident among my group of friends me and two of my friends were out at lowville park and we were watching shooting stars. I was tying my shoes when my friend saw a shooting star which he described as being very big and very bright.He pointed in the direction at which the object disapeared behind the tree line. We then noticed a glowing starlike object peaking thru the tree line. This object then slowly hovered higher above the tree line(about 1 thumb length) and hovered there.it slowly began moving left to right , and up and down. the object was a solid glowing light and appeared to have no flashing lights that a helicopter or a plane would have.We also noticed, now that adreniline had our night vision at max, a vapour trail that my friend said was the path of the shooting star that he saw. This trail was in a spiral shape. I tried calling my friend to get him out there with his video camera because we were watching it for a half hour and at this point the obect was stationary and appeared to be going nowhere.my friend said he had no tape for his camera, so i called a girl in hamilton who i knew had a camara.she too had no film but told me she could seefrom here balcony and that it was so bright she could only stare for so long.she also told me that her cat was out on the balcony crying with itz tail between itz legs. After that we followed this object and it appeared to be slowly moving towards lake ontario, and we continued watching it as it went higher andf higher.....finally at about 7:30 am, its was broad daylight and this object could still be seen going higher and higher into the sky until it disapeared. I have friends who have seen these objects on 2 seperate ocassions but i never believed them. they too saw them at lowville park.one of them guessed what time this happened to us because he too said that his animal ran into his room crawling and crying with itz tail between itz legs at the time that it passed over the city towards the lake. we also noticed various birds flying north in v patterns away from this obeject. this has led me to believe that whatever propels these spacecraft, it must give off a high pitched sound that only animals can detect, much like a dog whistle. I also believe they can be seen thoughout the month more than once and that there is a connection to these lights and lowville park because of the numerous sightings;43.3744155893536;-79.8204209125475
glowing green light resembling a ruler, moving slowly with no up or down motion;2010-06-15 02:46:00;2-5 minutes;Glowing green light resembling a ruler, moving slowly with no up or down motion. I awoke from sleep last night to go to the washroom, and on returning into my room I glanced outside and noticed a glowing green rectangular object approximately 500 metres away.  My estimate of the size of this object, taking into account the distance it was from my window, is that it was in between 10 and 30 centimetres wide and 120 to 200 centimetres tall. After throwing on some clothes and shoes I left my house and observed this object from the top of my driveway (~465m away). The object appeared to slowly float right to left parallel to the ground, at an estimated 5km/h.  It continued its course until it was obscured by trees that blocked my vision. The easiest way for me to describe the appearance of this object is to compare it to an oversized ruler. I have been trying to come up with an explanation of what I saw, and as such I have thought of a few questions already that readers of this report may want to ask, so I present to you some more facts:  There are no lights in my room that are green, or otherwise. I did not turn on the lights when I got up to go to the washroom, so this sighting couldn’t have been caused by a reflection of light from my room, or my house. I did turn on a light in the washroom, but it is a dull 40w glazed bulb, and I didn’t look directly at it, so this couldn’t have been a case of after-images in my eyes created by looking at a bright light source while my pupils were dilated from darkness. I can’t discount is the possibility of fireflies engaging in some sort of strange behaviour, as the colour of green was identical to the colour that fireflies produce. As to why these fireflies would /could behave in this type of behaviour is beyond me. I considered the possibility that someone could have had some sort of reflector /light/glow stick on the side of a bike, or on pants or arms, but this doesn’t seem likely since the object was moving in what appeared to be only along the x axis from right to left, not up or down at all – contradictory to what one would expect to see if this object was affixed to somebody’s leg or arms while walking. What do you think? If you have any ideas as to what this object may have been, please let me know!;43.3744155893536;-79.8204209125475
Unidentified red lights in the sky;2012-05-26 23:00:00;20 mins;unidentified red lights in the sky At around 23:00 i got in my car to go to the store and i noticed 3 redish orange lights in the sky so i thought to my self that they might be planets catching the suns light but then i noticed more lights traveling towards the area that i live in so i stopped at my girlfriends store called her out to see what was going on and the guy that works beside her came out as well to see. i stood in the parking lot for a few mins and decided to go back home to get my camera going, so i got my girlfriend to call my brother at my house to tell him to go out side and look at what was going on. So when i got home i grabbed my camera while my daughter and my brother were standing there i tried to get some photos but couldnt get any of real detail so we stood in my backyard watching these lights of some sort travel in a very tight formation that was in perfect sequence except for one light that changed direction out of all, another thing that we did notice that the light was dissappearing all in the same spot of its travel through the sky.   I do believe that we are not alone and i think this put the icing on the cake;43.3744155893536;-79.8204209125475

Approximately 20-25 orange oval lights were seen flying east from the Toronto direction to south west in a cluster over Lake Ontario.   As the light objects ascended upward, eventually they disappeared.  This lasted for about 10 minutes.   We were very taken aback and initially thought they had to be planes, but too many were clustered together, which would be impossible for planes to take off in a similar formation especially at 21:30 at night.;43.3744155893536;-79.8204209125475
Two amber lights appearing intermittently one moving left to right disapearing and reappearing, the other falling in an arc.;2013-11-17 20:00:00;~10 minutes;Two amber lights appearing intermittently one moving left to right disapearing and reappearing, the other falling in an arc. I was smoking a cigarette on my 8th floor balcony two nights ago and saw some strange amber lights out over the lake.  At the range I was standing it was impossible to tell what I was looking at or how far away it actually was, but I was certain it was over the lake. It was raining and visibility across the lake was poor, the lights on the other side being completely obscured.  I looked at the weather network website that evening and noticed the wind was blowing 50kmh with gusts of over 70kmh.   When I saw the first amber light I thought it was an aircraft turning on its landing lights and circling in the storm.  I thought it was crazy for someone to be out flying in that weather.  The object moved left to right and disappeared as though the lights went out.   It then reappeared in roughly the same position it initially appeared and repeated what seemed like the same left to right pattern, at the same altitude before abruptly reversing left and descending on what seemed like roughly a 45 degree angle before disappearing again.  The way in which it abruptly went from moving right to moving left and the rate of descent was unnerving and suggested some sort of crash.  All this elapsed over approximately 2-3 minutes. I felt unsettled by how the light had behaved in it's movements seeming unaircraft like, there were no flashing lights of any kind through out.  I called my Father to the balcony to witness should the light reappear and it did approximately 1.5 to 2 minutes later.  It reappeared at approximately the same altitude and both my father and I saw it move left to right disappear and reappear in the same initial and repeat the left right pattern.   A second light, the same colour and intensity as the first, appeared falling from the sky what seemed like a fair distance to the right of the first leaving what I thought could have been a smoke trail but was impossible to tell given darkness and poor weather.  This light appeared at roughly the same height as the other object, perhaps higher and fell in an arc from right to left disappearing low to the lake.   I was so enthralled by strangeness of all this that I can't be sure when the first light disappeared, if it was before or after t! he second.  I asked my Dad, a retired detective, if he thought the second light was a flare.  He didn't think so.   Given the indeterminate range of the encounter and the poor conditions it was hard to say how high off the ground these objects were.  My instinct was that it was above the tallest buildings in town, but not very high in the sky.   The whole event did not take 10 minutes to elapse.  The amber colour was less orange than the street lights and looked more like fire.;43.3744155893536;-79.8204209125475

Similar to a lawn mower or maybe a train but we don't live close to train station and it's too late at night to mow your lawn. My dogs were creeped out. Now so was I. Ran to get my husband he thought maybe it was a train too? But it didn't make sense.. He shrugged it off. I went upstairs with our dogs and looked outside our bedroom window at the stars and saw an orange light the size of the star. It was drifting gently to the right so I thought it could maybe be a plane in the sky but then it flew away. A plane would not dissapear into the night sky like that. I knew something was off. I ran back downstairs into our backyard and the sound was gone.;43.3744155893536;-79.8204209125475
