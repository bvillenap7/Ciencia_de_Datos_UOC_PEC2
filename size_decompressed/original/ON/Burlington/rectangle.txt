5 lights in sky in Burlington, Ontario Boxing Day;2010-12-26 18:45:00;5 miniutes;5 lights in sky in Burlington, Ontario Boxing Day My boyfriend and I were driving on the QEW Eastbound towards Toronto.  Just after passing the Waterdown Road exit, we saw what appeared to be numerous planes in the North East sky.  We thought it was odd that there were so many and continued to watch them.  As we got closer near Kerns Road we could see a total of 5 lights.  One was huge and did not appear to be moving. It had a flashing blue light and a flashing red light but was way to big to be a airplane or a helicopter. It just stayed in the same spot.  The other 4 lights were further off in the distance behind this one and they were not moving either.   I kept thinking they were planes but they all stayed in the exact same spots and were too low to the ground to be airplanes or even stars.  They all had flashing lights on them. When we got closer we realized just how big the one with the red/blue lights was.  It almost looked like a blimp.  You could see an outline even though it was so dark out.  We kept watching! and we could see it all the way until we exited the highway at Guelph Line.  On our way home we looked for it again and did not see anything.  This morning we were in the same area and looked around to see if it could have been towers, or something else that we were seeing, but there is just nothing there!;43.3744155893536;-79.8204209125475
