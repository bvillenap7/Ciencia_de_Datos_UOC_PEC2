Glowing orange orb seen in Burlington, Ontario;2012-09-15 21:30:00;30 seconds;Glowing orange orb seen in Burlington, Ontario When driving home from mini putt my husband and 3 children ages 13, 8 & 7 noticed an unusual orange glowing orb in the sky. They described it as a low flying aircraft, but we're stunned by the color and pulsing of the object.  It was flying parallel to them along Plains road.  They decided to turn down a side street to better view, at almost that same moment the object made a sharp change in direction making a 90 degree turn, it then accelerated and quickly became smaller then vanished in the far distance. We are amature star gazers, we can identify the big and little dipper, and watch for falling stars, we see multiple aircraft coming and going from the Hamilton airport.  They were very shocked and unnerved by what they saw.  They describe as not normal.;43.3744155893536;-79.8204209125475
