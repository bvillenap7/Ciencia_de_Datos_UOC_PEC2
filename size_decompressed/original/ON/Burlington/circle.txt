My family and I were out on our patio when we saw 3 flying orange circles that were going way too fast to be an airplane.  They were in a triangle formation then moved closer together and then about 5 minutes later a lone one followed.

20 orange ufos in sky.  Always believed finally see for my own eyes.;2015-08-21 22:30:00;10 minutes, or less;20 orange ufos in sky. Always believed finally see for my own eyes. At around 10:30 pm, I went I to my balcony of my apartment, 3 floors up.  Over a horizon of trees, I noticed 5 red balls hovering/moving fairly slowly in the sky, and then another 5 followed and so on until about 20 went by.  They moved super slow and a couple just vanished into no where.  It's like the light just went out.   As well, as most of them changed a formation to a triangle, 1 at the top, 2 at the base.   Just before they stopped, my dog then came outside and staring peeing everywhere...  He has never peed on my balcony a day in his life.  And I ran down stairs to see more then my boyfriend said that there was 3 more that went by as I was trying to get downstairs to see.   After we noticed a couple planes going by that we normally don't see many.;43.3744155893536;-79.8204209125475
