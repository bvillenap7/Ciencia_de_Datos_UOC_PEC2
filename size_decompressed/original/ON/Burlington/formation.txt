A line of seven bright green and white lights moving from northwest to southeast I was driving southwest through Burlington on the Queen Elizabeth Way between Toronto and Hamilton when I saw a line of seven bright green and white lights moving from northwest to southeast across my field vision in front of the car and about 30 degrees above the horizon. The lights appeaed to be about thumb to little finger in size at arms length. The two green lights were bigger than the white lights. Within the row the lights were not evenly spaced but as the formation moved the distance between them remained the same and they remained in a line. I couldn't see anything connecting the lights. The length of the formation filled the width of my windshield. As they passed towards my left I rolled the window down but I could not hear anything other than the traffic which had slowed down considerably during this event. The lights passed out of my field of vision to the left. The whole event took about 10 seconds. I am a sixty-one year old woman. I have a university degree in psychology and sociology and a Bachelor of Education I am a retired school teacher. I have four children and six grandchildren.;43.3744155893536;-79.8204209125475
Formation of lights moving across the night sky, burlington, ont,can.;2011-04-09 22:28:00;3 minutes;Formation of lights moving across the night sky, burlington, ont,can. Me and my wife were standing on our deck in our backyard, just looking at the stars. I was just looking around and she said Oh my God! Look at those stars!   We soon realized, no way stars move like that.  They looked almost as far as the stars, but there were 4 in a line, and 2 behind the ones on the far left and right, so we believe there were 6 of them.  They were moving very fast, across the whole sky in a matter of seconds.   Then before they exceeded our sightline, we saw them just disappear.  Maybe 2 minutes later, this time  I said Oh my God!  There's another one! I couldn't exactly tell if there were 3 in a triangle, or one that was just closer down to us in the shape of a triangle.  This one moved just as fast, a matter of seconds, and it disappeared just like the others.   Shortly after, the whole sky was covered by clouds.  I just found that one very strange.. We don't know what we saw, but we know it wasn't like anything we have ever seen.;43.3744155893536;-79.8204209125475
