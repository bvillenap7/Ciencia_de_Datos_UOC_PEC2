comet-like cloud close to M33;2007-06-10 18:45:00;60 mins +;comet-like cloud close to M33 I just wondered if any of you were out stargazing last evening and can help me identify an object.  6:45 pm  In the vicinity of M33 I discovered a comet-like cloud but too big to be a comet.  It was about the size of the full moon at zenith and quite bright with a white star-like spot at center.  It seemed to be moving so I ran inside to get my binoculars and was amazed to discover a lanceolate shape cutting across the 'cloud'.  Satelites were cutting through the binocular field of view and it seemed to be about the same elevation.  My thought was that something had gone very wrong onboard a sattelite, but it kept moving to the north.  Over the next 60 minutes it continued on a northern trajectory until it passed through Cassiopeia, by which time the circular cloud was long gone and the lanceolate shape of its contrail was becoming quite diffuse. The fact that it took an hour to travel that 'small' distance makes me wonder what the heck I was looking at!;44.3151;-80.0953
