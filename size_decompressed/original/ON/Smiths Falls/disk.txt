I looked out my window facing South-West and this long, almond shaped object appeared out of nowhere and began to move across the sky. It looked metalic and the sun shining off of it was so bright it hurt my eyes to watch. It took about five seconds for it to move from one side of the visible sky to the other. I tried to follow it but just as I was about to move to the next room it blurred slightly and I could no longer see it. But I could hear it. It made a very high-pitched humming sound, but it was very quiet. I had to strain to hear it.  Then I saw another craft, but it was human. I could tell because of the slow movement and the trail of white smoke from behind. It followed almost the same path, but went past the spot the craft had vanished at. After a while anothercame by from a different angle, and another after that. They seemed to be trying to locate it.;44.9000863636363;-76.0104704545454
Bright light traveling faster then an airplane across the sky with a shape.;2010-12-08 17:30:00;5 min;Bright light traveling faster then an airplane across the sky with a shape. My boyfriend who is a dry waller was lying on our love seat and a light in the sky caught his attention. He at first thought it was a shooting star, but after staring at it for a few seconds he realized it wasnâ€™t. He then called me over and told me to look. We watched this one bright light for a good 5 minutes before it was out of our sight.  The object we saw was neither a plane nor a shooting star. This was a bright light traveling faster then an airplane.  The sky was bright and I could see a shape to the object.  The shape to me looked round.  This is not the first sighting that we saw in this area.;44.9000863636363;-76.0104704545454
