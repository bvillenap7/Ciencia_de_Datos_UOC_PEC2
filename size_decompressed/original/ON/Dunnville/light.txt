Moving up and down, stays still then side to side, then will drop fast, very strange moving.  When I first saw it I thought it was a star exploding with all the red and white flashing. Also goes fast up and down.  Very odd moving now going faster.   NOTE - looked at time was 2:09, looked back few seconds later and one clock said 2:08 after I seem 2:09.
