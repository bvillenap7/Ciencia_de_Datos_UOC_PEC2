I took a couple pictures from the south end and ended with 4 more from the north end. Not knowing until a friend and I looked at one of the pictures, that there was an Unidentified Flying Object in one of my shots. It happened to be my last shot before coming back in to the building. The picture turned out to be just like all the other U.F.O. pictures out there. The way the UFO is sighted in the picture, it appears to be flying by. The top of the object is bright and the bottom appears to have a dark shadow. This disk type or saucer flying by was one of my most unbelievable moments. Please take the picture and clarify what it is exactly. I think it clearly shows there is something out there.;45.799;-81.7175
