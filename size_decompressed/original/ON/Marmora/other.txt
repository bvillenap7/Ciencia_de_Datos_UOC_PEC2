After midnight, on August 14, 2011, approximately 00:30hrs, my husband and I were sitting on our back deck of our cottage, in Marmora Ontario, Canada, when we notice an unusual orange/red /light/glow travelling across the sky from the South/ Eastern direction to  the North/Western direction.  It travelled in a straight line, just under the clouds, taking approximately 2 minutes to travel, and then picking up speed for approximately 3 seconds, then disappearing into the clouds on our right side.  We were unable to get the camera and snap a picture of this unusual light/object. As we were discussing what we had just recently viewed, approximately less than a minute later, another similar object travelled in the same path across the sky and disappeared into the clouds on our right side.  My husband was able to snap 3 pictures of the event.  He adjusted the settings of the camera to get a better picture as the object was difficult to track.  All the photos taken are of the second object.  The camera used was a Canon SX30 IS.;44.4806;-77.6843
