Fireball in the Ottawa area night sky, 26JUN'13, off toward East.;2013-06-26 23:00:00;? witnessed for about 1 m;Fireball in the Ottawa area night sky, 26JUN'13, off toward East. Late evening, facing generally East, noticed large orange object in night sky, ~ 10 times size of Mars/Venus, and much brighter.  Resembled a fireball in the night sky, can't tell if inside atmosphere, but would imagine it was.  Object increased and decreased in intensity, may have flared a bit at times, and moved eratically, but slowly in a general vicinity of about moon size area, at that perspective.   Couldn't tell if it was coming or going, but then with a slight dimming, it suddenly disappeared.   That is all...
