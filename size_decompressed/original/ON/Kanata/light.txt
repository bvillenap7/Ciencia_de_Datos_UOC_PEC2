Pulsating glowing red light around a big round bright light;2012-12-24 23:30:00;10 minutes;pulsating glowing red light around a big round bright light I spotted the object around 11:30pm while my husband and I were driving back to his sisters.  Once I pointed it out to him ...we pulled our truck off the road and got out and watched this round light that had a glowing pulsating red colour around it as it continued in the direction of North/West.  It was not unusual to see planes...however there was no sound coming from this object and with a glowind pulsating red colour around it.  After watching this object flying for roughly 4 3 to 4 minutes ....the lights went out but we could still see the object flying..it looked to me as if it was a square shape.  This would be my second time witnessing a UFO.;45.3201018518519;-75.8913712962963
