More than a dozen round fiery orange objects floating quietly by in the night sky.;2014-12-28 19:45:00;8 minutes;More than a dozen round fiery orange objects floating quietly by in the night sky In the clear night sky were more than 12 orange fireballs coming from the east going southwest, floating in a line with erratical spaces between them, some slowing down while others were trying to catch up.  There was a building obstructing my view so they were not visible once they reached that point.  I was on my terrace so there was nothing that could be called a reflection of anything.  I actually ran in and took a picture, but it just looks like little white dots in the sky.;45.3201018518519;-75.8913712962963
