Star like object moving but not a satellite		;1999-01-21 06:00:00;15 min.;Star like object moving but not a satellite		 I was ice fishing and looked up in the sky and one of the stars was moving and I thought it was a satellite. I told my friend to look, and then the object started to maneuver about the sky, going back and forth, stopping, and did a couple of half circles and we watched this go on for 15 minutes, and then cloud cover started to come in. It was hard to tell how far away it was but seemed like a great distance, and it moved about a foot in each direction (but the actual distance was much greater).;46.4973;-81.0128
