The first set were of them in their living room, then shortly after that I went outside to take some photos of their house (which is only about 2 yrs old). Outside and across the road facing west with no sun visible in the sky, I started to take some shots that were more or less experimental,testing different settings. I was using a Canon EOS 10D digital camera with a Sigma 24-70mm lens. Later this evening I and my girl friend were reviewing our shots and noticed through enlarging (in the camera)something over their house. The item appeared to be exactly in the same position through several shots but then gone in some of the early ones. The UFO was a curved object separate from a circular object at the same level at an undetermined distance apart. P.S. The present form of the photos is in RAW format. How do I proceed to send you photos??? Please Advise, Thank-you.  Regards ((name deleted));43.8615864285715;-79.0324928571427
thick beam of greenish light that did not taper lasted about 1.5 to 3 seconds;2004-07-14 20:00:00;1.5seconds;thick beam of greenish light that did not taper lasted about 1.5 to 3 seconds I was sitting on my friends deck out back of his house haveing a conversation with him, i was perpinticular to the house and my friend had his back to the house facing the open sky. my friend was talking and in the middle of him telling a story about something thathad happened the weekend before his mouth dropped and tilted his head to look at what he was witnesing, I then looked the same direction as him when i seen a greenish light in the sky, it was about the width of my pinky finger and grew longer very rapidyly. it did not taper off like a shooting star or a comet or meteor, the entire beam of greenish light was the same thickness. it then got a certin length the whole beam got brighter then dissapered in an instant. i looked to my friend and asked him what that was. neither of us had an explanation for it so i quess it was a UFO, i sat there and tryed to cotemplate what it might have been, it could not have been a plane because it was nothing like a plane, i know what a plane looks like in the sky, and it couldnt have been a meteor because the tail did not taper off, this still scares the crap out me til today i was just wondering if anyone else has seen anything similar to this if they have my e-mail adress is ((address deleted)) (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
