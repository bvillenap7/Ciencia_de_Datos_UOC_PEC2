Cone shaped object seen in daytime.;2001-04-25 18:10:00;20 seconds;Cone shaped object seen in daytime. I was driving home from work and I noticed something glinting in the sun. I thought it was a small airplane or a remote control airplane. It glinted white silver and then red. I watched it pass over the highway and out of my side window I seen that it had no wings. It was flying in a straight SW to NW direction, pointy end first, it seemed to be quite small about 5 or 6 feet in length 3 or 4 high. I had a very good look at it as it was only approx.1/4 KM away. I pulled off of the highway but by the time I stopped I had lost sight of it.;43.8615864285715;-79.0324928571427
