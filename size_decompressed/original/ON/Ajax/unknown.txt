Random blinking dark yellow light, travelling NNW toSSE at 500-600 mph, estimate alitude 10,000-15,000 ft;2010-08-04 22:25:00;Approx 1 minute;Random blinking dark yellow light, travelling NNW toSSE at 500-600 mph, estimate alitude 10,000-15,000 ft Observation Date: july 04/10 I was sitting in my backyard (evening of July 04/10) observing satellite fly-bys, when I noticed a light flash (object). I looked for the object with 8x42 binoculars, but could not see anything.   About 6 seconds later, I observed another flash(object), then 2 seconds later, another flash in  the same area of the sky.  At the same time, a two engine, wide body commerial jet (flying out of Toronto International airport) came into the vicinity of the flash.   Next the object turned on, what seemed to me to be dark yellow landing lights.  I thought the object was trying to let the commerial aircraft know that it was in the area.   The object's lights were on for less than 3 seconds and it was gone.  Again, I tried to look for the object with binoculars, but couldn't see anything.  At first I thought it was a military aircraft or UAV, but as far as I know Cananda doesn't fly that type of aircraft over domestic soil and if they did,I don't think that they would fly it in a commerial air corridor-travlling NNW to SSE (same direstion as some satellites)-random blinking light-80 degree elevation from observation point-estimated speed, 500 to 600 mph -estimated altitude, 10,000 to 15,000 ft -observation location, Latitude 43.82290 Longitude -79.01230   I am an amateur astronomer and an aviation buff, at night I've seen birds flying, different types of aircraft, meteors, satellites, spent boosters, space junk, etc., but I have never seen anything like this.;43.8615864285715;-79.0324928571427
