Sighting of triangular object.;2013-09-01 21:50:00;1 minute;Sighting of triangular object. We were driving south on Finley avenue in Ajax Ontario when we noticed a triangular object in the sky off to our right hand side at about 9:50pm.  It was hard to tell how far away it was but it was low enough that we had to stop and back up to get a good look at it because houses and trees were blocking our view.  After telling our son about the incident he said the craft may have been hovering over the Pickering nuclear station.  He listens to coast to coast and says the experts on that show say these crafts are sometimes attracted to these places. After watching it for about one minute each light on the craft faded one at a time starting with the front point.  After that we could not see the craft anymore.  We apologize but this is our first time ever seeing or reporting an event such as this, we want to stay anonymous so we will not be filling out contact information. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.8615864285715;-79.0324928571427
Flat-bottomed triangle craft in residential area.;2014-08-10 21:24:00;~3 minutes;Flat-bottomed triangle craft in residential area. Seen outside my bedroom window at about 9:25pm Sunday evening August 10, 2014. Large triangle shaped object, completely flat on the bottom, with 3 orange/red lights, with white lights in the middle on each corner.  It had no wings or tail and made a strange shushing sound, as it went slowly past our house, from east to west.   Not sure of the color, due to the twilight.  It looked VERY large to Me. It appeared to be close enough to our house to touch!  I have never seen anything like this in my 72 years.   I am 100% sane and not on medication that would cause hallucinations, nor have I read/watched or had any interest in UFO's, but what I saw is very similar to pictures my son (the one typing this report) has shown me online of 'black triangle' objects!!;43.8615864285715;-79.0324928571427
Trianglar pattern of lights over Ajax, Ontario.;2015-06-04 02:20:00;>1 hour;Trianglar pattern of lights over Ajax, Ontario. While out on a break during a midnight shift, we noticed a star that was moving around. It started in the eastern sky, and stopped pretty much directly overhead.  it was to the north of Vega and the light was brightest in the formation was the magnitude of Vega and slightly smaller.  On closer viewing of the craft or what ever it was we noted there were 3 lights forming a triangular pattern.  They stayed in a triangle and moved around unlike any of the other stars.  I was using Vega as my reference point as I am a bit of a back yard astronomer.  (only wish i had my telescope or binoculars with me) with the naked eye, they were in arms length reference a finger width apart and made no sound.   I have no idea of what altitude only that they were straight up in the sky and stayed in a triangle.  They moved in strange movements, almost like they were drifting around and then going in erratic darting around movements.  After approximately an hour, they faded in the black background of the night sky.  strange event for all involved!;43.8615864285715;-79.0324928571427
