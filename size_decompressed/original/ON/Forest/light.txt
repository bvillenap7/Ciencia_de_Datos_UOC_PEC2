Started at one end of the sky (NW), moved across to the other side (SE) in approximately 5 minutes. Was watched closely by 2 witnesses who were puzzled as to what it was. Definitely was NOT a plane or even a satellite. Looked similar to a star, but was brighter and larger. Moved awkwardly through the sky, in a half circle pattern. Sped up near the end of it's flight. When it reached the other end of the sky, it disappeared.;43.1003;-82.0085
