As i was leaving my friends house, pulling out of his driveway, above the treeline to the NE a green streak appeared with a yellow spot on the bottom of it and was descending rapidly towards Earth and dissapeared in about 2-3sec.  Although moving fast, it did not appear to come close to the speed of a meteor and appeared to be a solid object moving downwards.;43.3923;-79.9803
