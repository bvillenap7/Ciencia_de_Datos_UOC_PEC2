Four orange lights moving steadily across the night sky, no sound,  Flying at approx. 3 km altitude, four witnesses.;2013-06-01 22:15:00;10 minutes;four orange lights moving steadily across the night sky, no sound,  Flying at approx. 3 km altitude, four witnesses On the evening of June 1st, 2013 I was sitting outside on my deck with some friends.  I looked up and saw a steady orange light coming out of the northwest sky, approximately 20 seconds later a 2nd light appeared, and two more in succession.   The sighting lasted about 10 minutes from the first light to the last.   The lights moved across the sky in a steady motion, from the northwest to the southeast.  The lights faded out of view, each light took about a minute to appear and disappear.   The second light came about halfway across the sky, then disappeared behind some trees, whereas the other three flew straight across the sky.   The lights were, in my estimation, about 3 kms in the sky.  Conditions were cloudy and warm, cloud cover was low, and it had rained before and after the sighting.  There were no flashing lights on the objects, and no audible sound was heard.;43.7571;-80.6691
