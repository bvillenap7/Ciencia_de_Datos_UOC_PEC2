My husband and I were sitting on the back deck at 8:20 pm today (Sat. August 28th) when my husband tried to draw my attention to what he thought was a satellite travelling across the darkening sky. The sky was clear, with no haze or clouds to speak of. I had trouble locating the object initially, but he persisted until I saw it too. It was a small yellow light, not unlike a distant star, but was moving steadily across the sky on what appeared to be a satellite orbit path. However, seconds after I laid eyes on it, we both watched in amazement as it suddenly stopped dead in it's tracks. Almost instantly, it changed direction 180%, back-tracking on it's orginal path. About three seconds into its new path, it flashed very brightly, at LEAST 10 times as bright as it had been originally, and moved rapidly upward in an arching path, fading from our vision within four or five seconds. It did not re-appear in the next 5 minutes, and we came in to report it somewhere, which I guess has turned out to be here! It was a very exiciting and unusual experience, as the flight manouvers of the object were hardly typical of a conventional aircraft! Please let us know via e-mail if others have reported this object, or if there is a simple explanation for this unusual phenomenon. Thanks!;45.1988;-75.8428
