Just learned about this UFO Reporting Center today after listening to the Coast to Coast radio program. Unfortunately I did not write the event down on my calendar, but in early September of 2005, my husband and I were sitting on our deck, about 7 pm in the evening, watching birds in our backyard.  I looked up and saw a small airplane flying quickly, but fairly low across the sky, from right to left (south-east to south-west), with it's lights flickering. The sun was behind us and shone directly on the plane. Immediately above the plane (a few miles higher up in the sky) was a very large, capsule-shaped object moving very, very slowly...if at all. The sun was reflecting directly off of it making it shine a very bright gold metallic color.  I pointed the capsule out to my husband... who does not believe there are UFO's...and will only admit to seeing a 'light' in the sky.  He did not pay much attention to it, but I did.  The sky was clear which made the next part strange to me.  The capsule appeared to move slowly  behind a cloud or a cloud slowly covered the capsule and eventually the capsule disappeared.  The cloud's shape was not defined in any way, except the edge that slowly enveloped the capsule. Because the 'cloud' had no definition or color the capsule could have been going into a slit in the sky.  While the huge capsule was slowly disappearing, the small plane continued to move quickly across the sky under it.  Do not know what it was, but it is seared into my memory!;42.9376;-79.942
