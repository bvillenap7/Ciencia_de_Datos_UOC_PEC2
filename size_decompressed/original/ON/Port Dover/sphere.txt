Bright glowing object in the night sky;2012-05-20 22:26:00;40 seconds;Bright glowing object in the night sky Port Dover Ontario, Canada Time was 20:26\ date was May 20 2012   As I walked out the front door of our home I witnessed a silent bright “glowing” orange object in the ESE sky.  The temp was about 65F and humidity was 26% so very little cloud and clear dark skies. As we live in a rural area and the Lake, Erie, is in our south about a mile away the sky is very dark. At first I thought of a helicopter,  No way because it was silent. The orb type object was silent and moving very fast towards the WNW.  Bye the time I retrieved my camera and ran to the back door to shoot a photo the object was past my overhead.  After the photo was taken, approx. 8sec, the object dimmed and then disappeared. The object moved in a straight line in an arc angle of 180 degrees, in other words straight across the sky at a fairly low altitude. The object was about the size of 1/8th of the full moon high in the sky.  It was singular object, no trail or other lights were observed.  Spooky to say the least. I am a 55 year old male who always looks up to watch the sky and this is the first time I am able to say, I am amazed at what I saw and no reasonable explanation can do.;42.9376;-79.942
Single bright orange sphere/orb seen in Port Dover, Ontario;2013-08-17 21:24:00;>2 minutes;Single bright orange sphere/orb seen in Port Dover, Ontario At approximately 9:34 p.m., on August 17, 2013, five witnesses were sitting by a campfire in backyard in Port Dover, Ontario.  While looking at the stars, one of the witnesses said “What is that coming there now?” and everyone proceeded to look at what appeared to be a substantially bright orange light approaching, perhaps 500ft to a 1000ft of altitude.  The object was heading West and making no sound.  It was also heading at  a constantly velocity – approximately 200-300 knots. The object was fairly large, larger and brighter than anything else in the sky.  Size is unknown because the altitude was unknown. As the single, bright orange object passed overhead, it began to climb in altitude as it moved away at a substantial velocity – perhaps the velocity that a single engine plane would travel.  At no point was any sound heard. The object was also looked at through the binoculars.  It appeared to be a bright orange glowing orb, perhaps in two sections.  A photograph was finally taken at the object began to move off.;42.9376;-79.942
