One bright-white orb moving erratically over highway 50 in quebec ,canada seemed to appear and warp to another point in the sky.;2013-10-14 16:00:00;30 seconds;One bright-white orb moving erratically over highway 50 in Quebec, Canada seemed to appear and warp to another point in the sky.  at 4 p.m. on October 14th, 2013.  I was walking my dog on the south bank of ottawa river by hawkesbury-grenville bridge when i saw the orb across the river over the highway 50 it was moving east-west then doubled back twice at incredible speed and then warped out of sight then re-appeared far away then again sped across sky then vanished.   During this time a second person walking their dog came up and i asked him if he himself saw what i was seeing.  he stopped and observed the same thing i have just described and he grabbed up his dog and ran off with tears forming in his eyes.  He exclaimed what the hell is that?  It's not a car....  He looked terrified. I myself, although far away from this object, I felt threatened ...even scared for my life.and I am still spooked.;45.5984266666666;-74.6175433333334
