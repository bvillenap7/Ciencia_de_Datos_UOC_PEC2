Looking towards the east two bright star looking objects were visible to the right of the moon.  Objects were at least as bright as ISS.  ISS  only had one pass during the 26th that passed earlier in the evening from the west to south. Lights had a blueish tint to them. Initially thought it was Jupiter/Venus, since they are close together right now but realized they are only visible early morning here.  Next thought was aircraft landing lights (LED type since they were blueish) but lights did not move and faded slowly not extinguished like aircraft landing lights and no strobes visible after lights disappeared.  Lights were close together diagonal from each other (As seen in red circle of graphic) Lights were motionless but faded over about 30 seconds from bright to faint to gone but without any movement in relation to the moon which seems to discount any bright satellites.  2nd image shows no satellites listed in that area close to the moon. Called local ATC tower at CYMX had one aircraft in that direction at low altitude, but nothing that should be in that area of the sky.;45.5984266666666;-74.6175433333334
