Strange string of lights in the sky.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-17 18:30:00;15 minutes;Strange string of lights in the sky Around 6:30pm in the sky of Hawkesbury we saw a series of 20+ single lined lights, spaced in equal intervals flying from West to East and disappeared into a vast black anomaly. The size of the black mass had to be over 5 miles across. The whole procession last about 15 minutes before all the single lights disappeared.;45.5984266666666;-74.6175433333334
