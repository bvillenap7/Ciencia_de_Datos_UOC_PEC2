PD));2016-11-27 22:15:00;45 minutes;White light, maybe elliptical in shape with several coloured pulsating lights. Yesterday, on Sunday, November 27, 2016, at 22:30 hrs in the evening, I was watching TV downstairs in my home. My father entered the living room and asked me to go upstairs and observe a UFO that my father and mother had watched since 22:15 hrs. I walked upstairs and proceed to the back corner room and looked out of the window,I observed a white light in the sky with pulsating red, blue, yellow and bright green lights. The light was in the distance, well above the tree line. My parents believed the object was elliptical in shape. It was not the red light on the top of the DND Carrying Place tower nor was it any CFB Trenton aircraft. We watched the UFO till 23:00 hrs.,the sky started to cloud over and ended our observation.;44.0479;-77.5706
