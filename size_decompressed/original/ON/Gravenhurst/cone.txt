Hundreds of local cottagers and residents of the town of Gravenhurst standing on the mainland docks watching the end of the fireworks display. Visual Description: 2 separate squadrons of 15-20 in each squadron, of bright orange, pear-shaped, glowing objects [similar in shape to a triangular Gemini space capsule], flying a loose triangle formation, flying from north to south west across the sky very slowly [about the speed of a helicopter]. Each squadron appeared on the northern horizon at the north end of the 22 mile long lake, and moved slowly southwards and south west towards the end of the lake and then continued southwards out of line of sight towards the City of Toronto area approximately 100 kilometres south. First squadron appeared and flew overhead over a period of 3-4 minutes at what appeared to be a lower level height of a commercial airliner [10,000 to 20,000ft], which was followed about one minute later by a second squadron at the same height and speed. After both squadrons disappeared on the southern horizon, a single bright orange object [which appeared slightly larger than the others] appeared in the north, and followed the same southwards path, somewhat like a rear guard. There was no sound. The bright orange objects had a very bright glow [an unusual vivid orange glow and narrow margin of orange is haze around them, and left no visible entrails or tracking marks in the sky. Each squadron formation changed in shape slightly as they moved slowly across the sky, with the distance between object changing slightly occasionally, and the shape of the formation adjusting slightly from triangular to single line shapes, and then back to into more of a box/square formation.
