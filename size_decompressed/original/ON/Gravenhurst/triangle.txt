Low flying aircraft - no flashing lights - no sound - travelling at speed;2004-05-06 23:20:00;10 seconds;Low flying aircraft - no flashing lights - no sound - travelling at speed I was sitting outside in my backyard, stargazing.  The conditions were clear with gusty winds.  Visibility was good.  I was looking to the northwest. A movement and light, coming from the west, caught my attention:  I looked up, a few degrees north of the zenith and saw what I initially thought to be a meteorite travelling eastward.  I realized it wasn't a meteorite - it was arrow-shaped with a blunt nose and resembled a military aircraft but it was completely silent.  There were no flashing lights but cast a dull reddish-bronze light which illuminated the entire underside.  I could see the general shape only because of this glow.  It was travelling at high speed.  It did not turn, nor change direction but continued to fly in a straight trajectory overhead, towards the north.  It appeared to be flying at a low altitude.;44.9205;-79.3628
