Triangular object with flashing lights seen by high-school teacher and university student;2019-10-22 22:09:00;4-5 minutes;Triangular object with flashing lights seen by high-school teacher and university student The object was triangular and had bright lights underneath, with three red lights. It appeared to hover for awhile over Lake Nosbonsing before slowly moving across the lake towards land. It was a large craft and it was flying much too low to the ground to be an airplane. As it flew over us, it wasnâ€™t as loud as you would expect it to be and it made an odd noise (you could hear a rumble, but more of a whirling noise). As it passed over our home, it seemed to pick up speed and move off quickly into the distance towards Ottawa. I captured a number of pictures of it (in one it actually looks oval and in the other, its shape looks different). My son was the other witness to it. He is a full-time Criminal Justice student and I am a respected high school teacher with twenty-two years experience.;46.2596;-79.2789
