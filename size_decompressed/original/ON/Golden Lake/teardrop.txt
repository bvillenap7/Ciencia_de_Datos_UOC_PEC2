Sideways teardrop shaped  object, glowing a florescent green. witnessed by many on the shores of Golden Lake Ontario;1982-08-24 22:00:00;15-20 seconds;Sideways teardrop shaped  object, glowing a florescent green. witnessed by many on the shores of Golden Lake Ontario End of the summer around 1982.  About 13 staff from Camp Red Pine were sitting around a bon fire beside Golden Lake.  Suddenly one person spoke up and said look. There in the sky was a sideways, teardrop shaped 'thing', a florescent green color, sitting in the sky.  We all froze. We watched.  It proceeded to move ever so slowly horizontally through the sky.   14 or 15 seconds went by.  It then turned upward(?), with  the teardrop rounded end facing down.  Then, without even a flash it went straight up and disappeared.  It was out of sight in a second or two. Just gone. There was no sound. There were no 'lights' per say, just this florescent coloring around this teardrop. WE all remained silent for another 10 or 20 seconds, then it was pretty much a 'What was that!?' from us all!  That's it. Five or six years earlier my father saw the same type of thing near Gooderam, Ontario. It was during deer hunting season, so i guess thats late October.  This sighting was early afternoon.  About 10 seconds it was in view.  We didn't see it go straight up or vanish, it just went out of our sight.  We tried to find it again in the sky, but it was gone. That's it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));45.5803;-77.2519
