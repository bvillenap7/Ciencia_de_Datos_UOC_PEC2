Floating Red Object;2004-10-10 09:45:00;5:00;Floating Red Object We were looking out our window when we saw a red floating object (almost looks like mars when it was close to the earth) to the south-south-east. We got the telescope out and took a closer look... It had green and red and white lights spinning around it. We watched it float in the sky for about 5 minutes and then it disappeared in less than a blink. Then it reappeared over Parry Sound for a second time. The approx. distance that it traveled it 10 kilometers in about. The strange thing was that it took about 10 seconds to go between the two locations. This is why we are reporting it to you, (you dont get to see things like this everyday).;45.6724;-80.3689
