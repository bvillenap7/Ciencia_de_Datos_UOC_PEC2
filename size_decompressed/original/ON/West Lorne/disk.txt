I got her under control happen to look up and saw a jet the immediately noticed a bigger object higher up and to the right of the jet.  It was larger, bright and shinny as it slowly moved across the sky for several minutes.  I tried to take video but the camera would not work properly, it would record then stop.  I manage to clock one picture.  I zoomed in and you can see the object as well as the jet.  What's compelling to me is that the jet has a contrails and this object did not.
