Tear drop shaped gold colored object travelling silintly at high speed in a linear west to east direction seen by my wife and I;2012-09-06 19:30:00;6-7 seconds;Tear drop shaped gold colored object travelling silintly at high speed in a linear west to east direction seen by my wife and I My wife and I were watching TV this evening, the sun was just going down and my wife walked over to close our rear north facing,  screen door when she saw the strange craft and called me up from the couch to look. The tear shaped object appeared to have an orange, fire, reflective color appearance and was completely silent. The UFO was traveling in a linear path from west to east at I high rate of speed (est. approx 6 to 700knts), it had no wings, tail plane or rudder of any kind.  I estimate its height to be approx 4 to 5,000 ft AGL and its size to be approx 50 to 80 ft long. It was a beautiful still evening with not a cloud in the sky both my wife and I watched it disappear over the horizon north of Toronto. FYI, I am an ex RAF brat, reservist and have held a private pilots license for many years, I can tell you that without any doubt this was no aircraft nor helicopter, in anyway, sense, shape or form. The town I live in is just under the northern Toronto TARSA which extends to 4000 ft AGL   All air traffic is vectored north to south in this control zone.
