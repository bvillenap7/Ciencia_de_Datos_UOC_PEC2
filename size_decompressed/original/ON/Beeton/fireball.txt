Driving home from work heading south on 15th side road, six random orange fireballs  appeared from the west and formed a line slowly floating to the north.  Slowly fading out one by one.  Then a minute later the same thing happened with 5 more fireball like objects forming a triangular pattern.  Again slowly fading out, during this time a plane flew past the objects so I could tell they were not a plane.   They were moving extremely slowly, once they started heading north.;44.0793;-79.7763
