Bright light in sky over Picton;2009-01-26 20:30:00;45 seconds;Bright light in sky over Picton I was on the front porch with my wife about 20:15hrs. I looked at the brightest spot in the sky i have ever seen. I showed my wife and asked her if it was a star. Just then the light went dim and the light went from round in shape to oblong. It then got really bright and moved about two finger widths to the North.  I ran in the house to get the binoculars and it was in a different place. My wife said it moved fast. I got the camera and took video of it it lasted about 45 seconds and then was gone.;43.9984615384616;-77.1431615384616
