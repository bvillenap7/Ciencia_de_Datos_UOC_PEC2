I didn't know where to ask, but we have noticed a very bright, strobing light in the south west horizon, we live in Southern Ontario & have watched this light change from white to green & it has a red glow from beneath, keeping a stationary position in the sky, so we know its not a plane or helicopter. We are merely curious as to what it is, if you know what this phenomena might be, please email us. Thank you ((NUFORC Note:  This report appears to us to be consistent with an observation of the star, Sirius, a very bright star in the western sky at the time and date indicated.  It is a dramatically twinkling star.));43.4801;-80.7626
