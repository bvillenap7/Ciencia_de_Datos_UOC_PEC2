There was a black helicopter buzzing around previous to the ufo sighting in the morning and the day before.;2007-08-31 15:10:00;15 mins;There was a black helicopter buzzing around previous to the ufo sighting in the morning and the day before. While at work in the Warden and Eglinton Ave.I came outside for break and looked up in the clear sky.I faced slightly southwest,and blocked the sun with my hand.About one half mile away in that direction.I noticed a object at about 2-5,000 ft,sitting stationary.I reached into my pocket and began to photograph -4 pictures taken.I looked down and noticed a couple of guys next door having their smoke.I yelled over to them      want to see a UFO ?   One of the fellow asked --where do you see it ? I ran over to them and pointed to the west.Their place of work wall blocked the direct sun rays.The of the fellow said it's a plane.I said it's not a plane--it's sitting stationary.As the three of us watched for about 30 seconds.The other fellow ran into his workplace and within seconds came out with another co-worker.The third person said not another ufo up there ! As now the four of us watched,it was moving slowly ,directly above of position.One of the guys said maybe they are coming to give us a anal probe.Just then the three of them run back through their workplace door-frightened.I stood outside and continued to watch this object and take pictures.I noticed once over directly above,it picked up speed at about 30-50mph would be a guess. As it moved east of my position,you could clearly see another one much higher up in unison moving slightnorth to the east.I looked back at the first one seen,,, gone ! In description of the craft--it was long and hanging vertical.It appeared to be in a tumbling motion,and as if the object was morphing in it's contained shape.The color was whitish and had a flickering flash coming off it every other second.Kind of like when the sun hits a mirror or metal.Real strange in behaviour and appearance.I remember seeing these types of crafts back-March 29,2006 after 10:10am.They were witnessed over the Don Valley Parkway.Pictures revealed a pea of white dot.

Bizarre changing shape/color object  witnessed by four witnesses;2009-09-17 12:53:00;2-3 MINS;Bizarre changing shape/color object  witnessed by four witnesses Here is my second ODD sighting to report to you on Sept.17th 2009.While at work in Scarborough.I exited out the company parking lot for a late lunch at exactly 12:53 pm.I looked up in front of me,while looking eastward and noticed this odd shaped object approaching me in the sky.It was really strange looking to identify to say the least-half mile away approx.I instantly grabbed my camera out of my pock~et and took pictures.I watched in disbelief and took more pictures, as this thing started to change shape  ??.It appeared to opened up like a long flat black sheet.The dimensions would be a guess 10-15 feet long in length by 4-6 feet wide ?.I yelled for a co-worker to view this thing.He and two others witnessed observed this thing along side me.I then noticed it changed course in direction, as soon as the witnesses were present.It appeared about 100 yards away at about 300-500 ft above ground, heading now north.I jumped in my car to drive to see if it was com! ing down and to see if it was large garbage ??.I drove through the industrial roads north of our work's parking lot.I could not see it anymore, driving through the north in direction. So I immediately gave up in two minutes. I then turned on Comstock to head for lunch.At the lights of Warden on Comstock.I noticed now north up higher,,, a brilliant white UFO-north quarter mile away.I instantly again, took more pictures of this second UFO,along with a SHORT video clip.Remember,this is my third sighting happening here today.I will send you the third report shortly -added with more photographic evidence.Words can't tell you, when I reflect from the that time of witnessing the total bizarre in sequence of events.PS While viewing the video clip,you can hear a strange repetitive sound.I'm  not sure of the source.Dog barking ??;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934
Very Low Bizarre Morphing Unknown Object;2015-05-06 15:05:00;~1 minute;Very Low Bizarre Morphing Unknown Object While on my afternoon break at work in Scarborough, Ontario May 6, 2015, I went outside to our work parking lot for a smoke Looking about in the sky for anything unusual  After about five minutes looking to the north -slightly west Noticed a strange low bizarre object - less than half a mile away It was moving east to west changing appearance I then instantly took out my camera out at 3 :05 pm est and took some pictures - eight in total After about thirty seconds taking four pictures I yelled and pointed to two co-workers that were about 30- 40 yards away--- UFO ! Each one said 'plane ' paying little attention to it I continued to watch and take more pictures It was quite low under 200 feet a guess ? Again the movements were strange and very slow Added to it had a flashing like light appearance - maybe sun's reflection off surface After about one minute lost sight of it due to the buildings northwest  What is interesting the first picture taken reveals  'two ' unknowns ? One even appears to really look like a distorted spaceship  I could only see one smaller unknown one So could the larger one photographed had just released a smaller one -  morphing probe type ?  After the sighting I approached both co-workers Showed them both the pictures taken revealing the clear pictures Both said ' not a plane ' and looked stumped to the images shown;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934
