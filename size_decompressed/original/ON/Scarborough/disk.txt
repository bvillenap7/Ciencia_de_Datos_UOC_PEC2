On April 23rd at approximately 9:30pm I was leaving My parents home after dinner and was walking out to my car. I noticed how clear the sky was as it had been cloudy, cool and rainy for quite a few days prior. Astronomy is a hobby of mine and I was facing west adimiring some of the stars when I noticed a plane approaching from the direction of Pearson International Airport. It wasn't to high up, probably a few thousand feet and I could see the wings, tail and fuslage as it flew over head. Just as it passed over I noticed three disc shaped objects that formed a triangle moving north and seemed to be lower than the plane. I could not see anything in between the discs such as a body or wings, and I began to wonder if they were in fact three separate objects moving together. They were not very bright and did not have any flashing lights nor did the brightness fluctuate but the discs themselves were well defined and not at all fuzzy or blurry. I called to my father who was at the top of the driveway but by the time he came down they had moved over the house and were getting lost in the light of a large mall directly north were they went out of site. The object/objects were larger against the sky than the plane and seemed to be lower in altitude. They made no noise whatsoever, they were silent, and moved quickly in a straight line north with no noticeable change in altitude. The siteing lasted about 10 seconds. I do not believe it was an aircraft as I could not see anything other than the discs and I could make out all of the jetliner that passed by. They did not make any sound, and it most certainly would have, had it been a plane. It was moving quite fast and must have been fairly low. If it was in fact much higher, than the speed was allot quicker than I origianally thought and the object would have been huge. The object/objects were about the size of the nail on your small finger held at arms length and about 1/2 inch apart at arms length. I am 36 years old, married and have been an ameture astronomer for 2-3 years now. I have witnessed many differtent events and objects and am more conscious of what goes on in the sky than most. This was nothing like anything I had ever seen before.;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934
Brilliant White flat shape object;2004-08-16 12:05:00;15-20 mins;Brilliant White flat shape object Date: August 16, 2004 Time: 12:05 p.m. While coming outside work in Scarborough for lunch at approx.12:05 p.m.  Monday Aug.16, 2004.  I witnessed from the west a white flatish like object very high, extreme white colour with no light. Shape appeared rounded with a slow floating action with a slight lift on one side and also as if it was slightly changing shape.  I rounded up 4 witnesses, 3 observed in disbelief while the fourth said it was a plastic white bag.  Wind was happening, as you can see flying fluffy seeds moving at a good speed from south to north.  This object hang stationary in the sky coming from the west to east for at least 15 minutes, than turn north into clouds.  Can plastic white bags create their own direction?  Height I would estimate was 10-20,000 feet.  (Do plastic white bags fly that high?)  Binoculars were used and this object appeared strange quite strange. (NOT A BAG)   Conditions of the sky was blue with a slight haze.  Cloudy to the north of Cummulus clouds were we lost sight of it. Duration was close to 20 minutes.  I'm really sorry I don't have pictures and even if I did, you would not get much of a picture because of the high altitude.  It does feel good to have witnesses because seeing is believing. Reinforces one's sanity   Needless to say  One week after. One of the witnesses came back to my place of work. He changed his belief IN THOUGHT= that it was a WHITE bag.. Good grief of the mind sET TO THE UNEXPLAINED;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934
Afternoon white long stationary saucer shape craft witnessed for 30 minutes by five witnesses;2004-08-16 12:05:00;30 minutes;Afternoon white long stationary saucer shape craft witnessed for 30 minutes by five witnesses Being it exactly 9 years to this date August 16,2012   I would like to report a white long UFO craft sighting over Scarborough,Ontario at approx.12:05 p.m. Monday Aug.16, 2004. While outside my workplace for lunch on a nice clear day with some clouds. I looked west in the sky noticing a long white saucer shaped object at about a mile or two away. This thing was directly west of our position Maybe at about 10,000 - 20,000 feet in altitude. I called a nearby Landscaper over to come see what I had been witnessing! He also confirm seeing it. As we watch it together in the sky It appeared not to be moving much, as we watched it passed 10 minutes. Also note : One side did slightly lift up . Like a boat on waves  I then ran into my workplace to get two more witnesses and binoculars. The two other witnesses could also see this unknown white craft AS IT DID HAVE SIZE. After using the binoculars to see closer. It appeared brillant white in color- long in length No other colors or markings could be seen. Still staying there near stationary. Now a truck driver pulled in and got out of his truck And was pointed out this white UFO still sitting in the sky. This now brought the count to four witnesses watching as well myself As we all continued to watch it wondering guessing to explain it ! This now being about 25 minutes when first seen. Was now starting to move quite slowly towards the north. I 'm guessing somewhere near over the Don Valley Pkwy.north. After another five minutes we all lost sight of it in the clouds. Needless to say : two witnesses thought it was a white plastic bag for an explaination The other two could not explain the object at all. Do plastic bags stay stationary in the same area of the sky over 25 minutes ? Even have such size at such a distance. This was a incredible sighting to witness  I can only conclude again a presence unknown again witnessed  I also noticed one hour later There were so many jets -every direction causing crosses in the sky. Thus the clear sky was now not so good in clarity as it had been earlier at 12:00pm;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934
