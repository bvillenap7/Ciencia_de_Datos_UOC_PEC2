Two brilliant white angel/cross shaped objects lingering above my workplace roof;2003-03-03 12:01:00;25 mins;Two brilliant white angel/cross shaped objects lingering above my workplace roof  While going on lunch at work.I stepped outside to have a smoke, at exactly 12:01pm est.I looked up at the clear blue sky and noticed a brilliant white angel/cross shaped type of object-not a bird.I stepped further back to see more of the sky to the north.I instantly observed another white object.The same as the first in description.Both were almost stationary and were apart in distance at about one quarter mile . Both had altitude between 5-10,000 feet -no clouds in the background-rich blue sky.As I continued to watch these objects in fascination for about 15 minutes.One of the objects moved off at the same altitude,heading southeast,towards Lake Ontario.There was no sound,and they had size way up there ! I then returned my eyes to the spot where the other still stayed almost stationary.I was in just a awe like state,wondering in my mind to identify this thing.Then after 5-8 mins.The second one started to move off.It headed off like the first one. In the sam! e direction-southeast.I continued to watch it move towards the east.What was most interesting in observation was I noticed no lights when it was closer to me.I would describe the objects to be the most brilliant white in colour your eyes have ever seen-no lights.There was low cloud cover towards the southeast. After about 5 minutes,the second object was about 2-3 miles away from my position.I could clearly see with the naked eye, as it was moving underneath the clouds.It looked like a white   light  moving eastward.I then lost visual contact due to further distance.I could not believe in witnessing this daylight sighting.Though, I will NEVER forget ,what it was I had witnessed on March 3rd 2003[333].Due to this unusual daylight sighting and being totally dumbstruck.I did not run to get any witnesses to view this dramatic sighting.I must report to you that this was the first sighting witnessed, since August 3rd,2002.This was the beginning of a incredible year 2003-Mars and! Earth's closeness in 60,000 yrs August 27th,2003.Not to menti! on 15 mo re sightings later witnessed [18 witnesses] in 2003 that defied logic/and associated paranormal activity on the ground.Added by a three foot flying snake like creature at camp.Also in deep shock to confirm on August 13th 2003 of being taken as a child 1963-1965.;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934

It hovered over the Durham area,near the power station and did not move,  it then flew off to the west,  and looked like a small plane.  It had been flashing lights.  Very unusual,  and it was a clear night. I watched it through binoculars.;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934
