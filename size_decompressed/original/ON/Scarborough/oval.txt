Two slow, very high flying dark oval objects moving in unison;2011-09-16 16:49:00;two minutes;Two slow, very high flying dark oval objects moving in unison On Friday,September 16th, 2011.  While at work in Scarborough  I had decided to go out for a quick smoke outside at 4:49pm. Looking high in the sky to the south . Way, way up there high in the sky. Were two dark somethings crossing the sky. I could NOT identify them with the naked eye. As they looked kind of distorted in movement  Instantly after 30-40 seconds watching them. I ran back into my workplace and retreived my camera. Being back outside less than 30 seconds. Looking up, I could still see them moving across. I then started to photographed them as they crossed the sky togther in unison. They moved from east to the southwest towards Lake Ontario. After taking six pictures and looking. I lost sight of them moving directly southward  These were very high in the sky to be birds. Not to mention the movements were very slow. In examining the photographs. They do not look like birds or even black jets. I had also noticed earlier that day 10:05am. Some military aircraft presence in the same area over the lake. Added in additional observation :  That September has become a hot month in UFO sightings like August. This I have noticed since 2003. It does really make one wonder ?   What's up ?   If one takes a a moment to look up !;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934
Slow Moving Daytime Oval Object with flashing white lights.;2012-09-11 10:14:00;4 minutes;Slow Moving Daytime Oval Object with flashing white lights Today on Tuesday, September 11th 2012 at work in Scarborough Yet now another daylight UFO sighting has again been witnessed and filmed over Scarborough   While on break talking with a coworker outside I noticed something suspicious flying above from the northwest. The object was flashing and movement was slower than a Cessna   The object was noticed at 10:13am moving across towards the east near over my work roof I pointed it out to the coworker and after 30 seconds she too could see it ! After she could see it for about half a minute  She ran off saying I have to go back to work!  I took most pictures from my old camera [11 pictures], as I had a problem with my new camera  Though have three other pictures taken and one short video clip taken on the new camera  This unknown object appeared about 5 -10 ,000 ft in elevation. It had size of a small plane  The white light was flashing on and off brightly on the object  I have downloaded 11 pictures and my friend mg has enhanced them splendidly  The sighting lasted about four minutes. The structure does look disk like   I’m sure the pictures tell the story   Enjoy further photographic evidence. PS Can’t wait to see the much bigger ones that fly above I’ve seen in the past *;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934
This object was small in size , it had bright glowing lights , it was very close to me . It scared me.;2013-07-10 22:20:00;10 seconds;This object was small in size , it had bright glowing lights , it was very close to me . It scared me. I was outside my house talking on my cell phone.  It was 10:20 pm.  The object had two very bright green glowing lights on the top and on the bottom it had one very bright glowing red light, i could see it was round or oval shape and metallic like a silver colour.  It was small, maybe three feet across, it's hard to say the size because I was scared. and I did not stay outside for long.  It was above the houses across the street from me at first, I registered its presence, I told my friend , and it started moving towards me, it made a noise like power lines make, it was a quiet buzzing sound, vibrating sound, it was moving steadily towards me very smooth and steady . It was not shaking or tilting to its sides, it moved very precisely and as far as I could tell there was no one on my street at all.  As soon as I saw it move towards me i ran inside my house and locked the door. It became obscured by the garage of the house to my left which juts out and that is the last i saw of it. I think this may have lasted 10 seconds at the most.  This was very scary because it moved directly towards me.  It was small but it did not look like a toy or a remote control something and it seemed to move perfectly , which really made me scared .  At first i was excited and could not believe what I was seeing because it seemed like it was a safe distance away , but it moved towards me from what seemed like a far distance pretty quickly .   The best word is efficient , if what I saw was a toy or someone built it then i will be happy.  But I think I saw a ufo .;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934
Sudden appearance bright white glowing vertical oval object then disappear;2017-09-30 15:22:00;10-15 seconds;Sudden appearance bright white glowing vertical oval object then disappear I feel this a great urge to share this remarkable sighting to you Even as I cannot believe what I have seen along with the very timing  On Monday, September 25, 2017, I was outside my workplace in the parking lot in Scarborough, Ontario.  There was also a coworker with me, as we talked and looked about at the sky for UFO's.  After some minutes he left to go back inside, leaving me alone I was at the north end parking lot looking northward   Due to not having a UFO sighting since August 18, 2017, I had wondered why ? at this time not seeing one for so long Since 2003 , I have witnessed them in this time period for day time sightings almost weekly   So I said out loud looking to northern sky 'I know , you know , that I know your up there ' 'Please show me a sign you are there '  After near a minute suddenly to my amazement looking Out of no where really Witnessed a bright glowing white vertical oval object There was size to it as well being very bright within its shape It was about one hundred yards away north  Maybe less than a thousand feet high  Moving from west to east very slow After some seconds pulled out my camera to film it Pointed the camera in front of my eyes and started to film it - video mode After, eight - nine seconds lifted down my camera to see the object It was not there anymore ? Again shocked wondering where did it go ? I reviewed my camera and there was nothing there Hence I assumed when I raised my camera to film it It just disappeared as fast as it had appeared  Not only I'm I shocked by this display of on and off switch More so how after calling it out something did appear to me Illustrates a really bizarre situation in wonderment I can only conclude this one did not want to get filmed Maybe only show me a sign Just like the one August 18,2017  PS Following day September 26,2017 Had another day time UFO sighting in the morning while on break This one got filmed to confirm Thanks for your time into the matter;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934

After outside for about three - four minutes Noticed up in sky high to the west - half away away A bright 'red' flashing object light  It moved very slow towards my position  I pulled my camera from my pocket  Took some still shots as it approached  Then put my camera down and grabbed my phone I looked up again and put the phone to the sky to video   That's when I realized as it should be overhead was now gone ?  I looked up trying to find it but had disappeared Reviewing the still shots had captured it on the first picture taken 10:04 am   The video came up empty as I expected Being a 'red ' light type of UFO Wondered from past UFO sightings that this type is extremely rare  Where near most previous sightings have been 'white' flashing types Purpose unknown;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934
