Pear shaped silver craft with wheel of colours close encounter;1977-08-04 20:45:00;15-20 mins;Pear shaped silver craft with wheel of colours close encounter   On the night of Aug.4,1977, while working outside at the location of Neilson Rd. and Ellesmere.I worked at Dominion Stores,serving cars for grocery pick-up.  A fellow parked along side the field in the parking lot asked look at the object over there-what is it?  I looked and said,it's a plane while I served a customer.The next car pulled up for p/u for groceries.The stranger said look,it's not moving-I looked and said -it's a helicopter.I finished the second car and again this fellow bothered me. Again saying look at the lights on it while staying inside his car ? At that moment I had no more customers to serve-so now I had FULL attention of what this fellow was asking about,in what to identify.Clearly,about a little over a mile-directly east bordering Westhill and Scarborough,Ont. -east of Morningside Rd..I could see a wheel of colours rotating clockwise at a very low altitude-just above tree tops.The fellow stayed inside his car,and I put my head down and ran across the field about 200 yds.I then stopped,to look a mile away to the east, with my workplace behind me.I looked and noticed it was gone from where I first saw it.I checked across the sky and looked behind me.I was in shock as I turned to the west.Just above me-off 10 degrees-- about 50 ft.away and 200 ft above in the sky-was a silver craft.I could not believe what I was witnessing at age 18.The description was a silver light bulb/capsule shaped craft.The larger back end facing me,had four distinct colours of light-in sequence blue-green-yellow-red.These lights rotated clockwise -one at a time.Inside the center of the perimeter of these four lights -a slightly larger orangey-yellow light that stayed on.There were no marks on this grayish silver craft-like one mould.This thing had no sound,and appeared 40-50 ft in length.Small end about 10 ft in diameter to the back about 30 ft in diameter.I watched this craft and light for about 15-20 mins.I felt at the time they were time travellers and shouted for them to come down, pointing t! o the gr ound.I felt the word Neanderthal and bone density pop into my mind.I could not await any longer to stand alone-I wanted to get some other witnesses to this marvel.I ran very fast back towards the store.As soon as I reached the edge of the parking lot,I heard a four pitch beeping sound.I dead stopped and turned around.The craft was moving very slow[5 mph] toward the northwest,and making the beeping sounds.The fellow who brought this to my attention was gone-nowhere.I ran into the store to have a co-worker friend witness this thing.He was unloading a 45 foot trailer of groceries-he could not.I run fast back through the store to go outside again.I screamed for a co-worker who collects grocery carts,to run over here.The craft was about less than a mile northwest of us-still flying very low and beeping.After a minute it was out of sight.This co-worker asked me,what is it ? I replied time travellers! We stayed together and look all around in the skies.After 10 minutes we went back to work.The store would be closing at 10:00pm,as it must have been 9:15pm at that point.Then I heard a whooshing sound directly above moving across to the east.My co-worker friend screamed across the parking lot and say-did you hear that ! I noticed a very low[1000-2000 ft] white trail-east to west -like a jet trail Again we both stood together at the edge of the field and witnessed a bright red and white light.Directly east about 10 miles,high in the sky.We watched the intensity of a red,then bright white shining on and off for a couple of minutes.Then suddenly,it went out and reappered south -near Lake Ontario.The location would be Pickering Ontario-where we watched at out vantage point in location.This light shined brightly on and off a white to red colour for another couple of minutes.Then it was over-but never forgotten of what it was I had witnessed.It is important for me to report this to you David.From 1967-2002 I have seen 9 ufo's in the month of August.But in 2003,all that changed.I had witnessed 16 more sightings start! ing Marc h 3,2003.IN TOTAL OVER 80 SIGHTINGS TO PRESENT**** JULY 2007.I have started to photograph them.

A   translucent  white morphing object on a straight flight path;2009-08-13 10:05:00;90 Seconds;A   translucent  white morphing object on a straight flight path   While taking break at work in Scarborough.I looked up at the clear sky above, at near the time 10:05am.I noticed a translucent morphing white object directly above me.I thought at first,that it to be a high flying bird.I then could see the shape and it's morphing tumbling movement .Thus, instantly by eye, confirming that it was a unidentified object.The altitude would be a guess at least a couple thousand feet +.This unknown object had considerable size to it.Within 10 seconds I grabbed my Canon camera 10MP beside  me.I took a 3-4 second video clip.Then took five still shots with a 5 X zoom.The behaviour of the object was on a straight-level flight path. It moved overhead from north to southward direction towards Lake Ontario.After taking five still shots-it just vanished before my eyes.The weather was calm-no wind.The skies were unusually clear in observation.I had a psychic feeling I would witness something un~natural today.I will also send you the short v! ideo clip along with two pictures that captured this strange WHITE TRANSLUCENT object.Please note: that today is a Last Quarter Moon.I have witnessed many sightings depending on the moon cycle * PS The other three still shots, did not capture this unknown object ? .PSS It was six years ago exactly today- August 13,2003. I confirmed of being taken, as a young child in Scarborough 1963-1965.Happy Anniversary to confirm once again that feeling.That there is a presence happening here in my observations **** Possible contact once again;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934
Red white light moves over Toronto sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable twinkling star.  PD));2011-12-23 22:30:00;>1 hr;red white light moves over Toronto sky While watching t.v. inside my home, I noticed a small star-like shape displayed in the South eastern sky.  This image first appeared weeks ago and has resurfaced frequently since.   On this day however, the object which flickers a red/white light at times, moved from its usual stationary position, and proceeded into a circular or oval pattern.  Object made no sounds and often moved at a crawl speed.  Object not believed to be aircraft of any type (for no visible beacon/strobe lights) and altitude was too low to be that of a star.

High Slow Long Dark Vertical Object Flashing White Light;2017-03-23 10:02:00;6 minutes;High Slow Long Dark Vertical Object Flashing White Light On March 23, 2017, while on morning break in Scarborough, Ontario I was outside admiring near clear sky.  Could see very high seagulls moving about just west above.  Then there was one alone which I thought to take one picture to just confirm it  It look a little different in movement by the naked eye  The time would be 10:02 am # 8462  After about 9 minutes later To my surprise could see north of the roof at 10:11 am Less than quarter mile away and very high - thousands of feet up  This long dark vertical object flashing white lights continuously It moved very slow from west to east Seconds after witnessing this pulled out my camera and filmed ASAP It was just flashing on and off moving across my view to the north As soon as it passed the building eastward It slowly changed direction Heading now southeast as I took my last few pictures of it at 10:16 am passing the roof southeast  After examining ALL the pictures  The first picture [8462 ] to which I thought was a high flying seagull at 10:02 am Is in fact NOT a seagull It is roundish in shape as well different in color/s in appearance  The second last picture [ # 8485 ] has captured this unknown long dark vertical object without any flashing lights Last picture [8486] taken illustrates two lights flashing - top and bottom   Now I do wonder is this the same object photographed at 10:02 am Both certainly do appear to be quite different in appearance  The second one being so high must have had size to it in length  These images were taken on a slight zoom being so high   You should get the images after this report is submitted  Enjoy the images ((NUFORC Note:  Photo indicates a tiny, blurry, light-colored object.  We cannot certify that the object is an authentic UFO.  pD));43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934
