Translucent Craft mile/s in diameter witnessed in the daytime;2004-07-02 16:45:00;5-8 seconds;Translucent Craft mile/s in diameter witnessed in the daytime On the date of Friday, July 2,2004,around the time 5:45pm. At the location of Scarborough,Ontario Near the intersection Birchmount/Kingston Rd. About 500 yards north from Lake Ontario. I was walking through the park admiring a nice clear, hot day. While walking westward through large trees in the landscape park. I stopped in the shade of a tree for a moment. Looking now and deliberately to block the sun. I looked up to the west in the sky and instantly become stunned of what I was witnessing in those 5-8 seconds. I can only describe in words that is simply incredible to imagine for any human. What I witnessed was semi-circular in shape. The size had to be at least one mile to even miles in diameter. Attitude looked quite high at 10,000 ft It's appearance was translucent like a jellyfish-bluish-white in color tone. It definately had a outside rim - Added by two smaller circles on the left side of this thing.Scale size to the larger 10:1 Each of these two smaller circles also had a outer rim. Showed the same trait of a thin rim around that appeared like one very LARGE outer  rim of semi-circle outline I watched it glide silently overhead from sound to north. It was a very freaky feeling those seconds witnessing this thing. I was after 5-8 seconds.that I became curious to see the wholeness of this craft. I wanted to know if there were two other smaller circles on the right side. I could not tell,due to blockage of tree to the right side. I instantly looked into the sun and was blinded by the sun's rays. I again looked up by blocking sun's direct rays, after about 10 seconds. I could not see it anymore. I cannot express to you what the emotions play in witnessing something so incredible. I thought it now important to report something that changes a person's life in thinking.Composite Drawing attached;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934
large trail above scarborough;2005-03-04 23:15:00;8 sec.;large trail above scarborough The time of the sighting was probably sometime after 11pm on friday march the 4th.   Walking by the intersection of McCowan Rd. and Danforth Rd., I was already paying attention to the planes in the sky.   Then, incredibly a large fire trail formed across the sky, just under the constellation Orion, as some large object burned up, heading in the general direction of Buffallo.  The trail then faded after about a 4 count.  This was no garden variety meteorite or 'shooting star' that I am familiar with from camping trips to northern Ontario.  I was absolutly stunned by the sight.  There might have been some flashes from the direction of the landing, but the light pollution made it hard to discern that positively.  The sky was clear otherwise.  I was besides myself.  This was the most spectacular earth entry that I have ever witnessed.  And right above scarborough.  I was watching the sky with greater intensity.  I walked on down Seminole Rd.  It's somewhere on this road that I saw what looked like a plane with a large white light speed by across the horizon.  The light was too bright for a regular sideview of a plane and the speed exceeded my expectations for a plane.;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934

Green fireball streaks across the Scarborough sky;2007-03-11 20:10:00;5 seconds;Green fireball streaks across the Scarborough sky My wife and I with our kids were travelling west on Ellesmere Road in Scarborough, Ontario, Canada Sunday March 11 2007 at approximately 8:10pm when we Green fireball travelling North to South lit up the sky.  It was much lower, larger and slower than your typical shooting star It was burning bright white-greenish with sparks flying off of it and behind it.  It burnt out before it landed.  It looked like it's trajectory would have brought it right near the core of the city of Toronto.;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934
