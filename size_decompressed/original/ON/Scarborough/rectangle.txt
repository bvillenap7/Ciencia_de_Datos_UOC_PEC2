Flashing Flat Silver Rectangle;2003-07-18 17:40:00;2 minutes;Flashing Flat Silver Rectangle On July 18th, 2003, in Scarborough, Ontario.I had decided to go the exact location where I had a close encounter of the first kind. This occurred in a field northeast at Neilson and Ellesmere Rd., near Westhill.  After finishing work, I arrived at the same spot to see anyodd signs of a presence in the sky.  I rotated around 360 degrees checking out the skies for anything odd blocking the sun to the west.  After about ten minutes in skywatching. To the west at about one and half miles away.  Location would be over Scarborough Golf Club Road to Markham Rd. I witnessed a silver flat rectanglar object moving across the sky at a few thousand feet. There were some clouds in the mix of the blue sky.  It looked very thin across,yet too large to be natural.As it moved across the sky from south to north.  I observed a bright white flash coming from it.. Similar like the sun hitting a mirror in a intense reflection signature.  While watching this,I noticed a large black bird ? circling around this thing. I'm watching this thing moving across for near two minutes, as it moved slower that a Cessna. I had then lost site of it, as it went into the clouds. Needless to say, I was in complete shock of what I just witnessed again.   Another sighting in SAME location I had witnessed back August 4,1977.  Could this be a sign of contact?  I even wonder today if that bird was a bird.  Just another strange sighing to report to you.;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934
dark object spotted in clear afternoon sky;2007-06-10 17:50:00;15 min;dark object spotted in clear afternoon sky Around 5:50 pm on June 10th. Playing baseball in east Scarborough (20 minutes east of Toronto) near Pickering at a park very close to lake Ontario. I spotted the object from the outfield, looking east toward Pickering. I got the attention of about 10 to 15 of my friends, non of which take the subject of Ufos seriously. Although it was difficult to pinpoint, the object seemed to be about 5-10 kms east of us, along the shoreline, maybe a little further north. My guess was that it was somewhere near the Pickering power plant. It sat in one spot for the remainder of the time we were at the park which was about 15 minutes. From where we were the object was about 1/2 of an inch long, by about an 1/8 of an inch tall, and seemed to be only a few hundred feet above ground. The object seemed to be more rectangular than disc shaped. It was black in color. It was absolutley not a plane, a helicopter, a bird, a balloon, or a kite. It was a very clear afternoon with only a few clouds in the sky. Although the object was not very large, once spotted, it stuck out like a sore thumb.;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934
