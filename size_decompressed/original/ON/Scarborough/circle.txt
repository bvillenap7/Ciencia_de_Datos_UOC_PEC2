White orb travelling along  side a thick chemtrail;2009-09-21 10:22:00;5-7 mins;White orb travelling along  side a thick chemtrail On September 21, 2004, at approx.10:22 a.m. -10:25 a.m. in central Scarborough, Ontario. I witnessed a white round object travelling from the west at the distance of about 1-2 kms max. The background was a absolutely clear blue sky with patches of cloud and a heck of a lot of puffy, white chemtrail lines and even included Xs. (Crisscross) Watching this white light for about a minute with the naked eye. I pulled out my binoculars for a better view. As I viewed the object at a great distance with a amazement. I could also see through the binoculars to the west. Six or seven smaller white objects around larger one.Or the larger object was closer to me then the others. This could be the first multiple sighting for me this year. I continued to observe the closer object with now my naked eye again. Now I focused on the larger one heading towards me from the west. This strange object appeared brilliant  white in color, no intense light now.It was perfectly round -360 degrees. Y! ou could almost classify it like a large orb.It moved like the Pac Man game. After 2 minutes of viewing with binoculars on and off. It got closer to me now to describe. I called a Fed X Courier Driver across the street to view. Within 10 seconds where I pointed straight south of us, he too could see the white round object with the naked eye moving across the sky. I passed the binoculars to let him have closer look. He had problems to focus through my binoculars and passed them back to me. We watched the object. as it got closer for another 2 minutes. It was travelling east.Now it was directly south of our position and to our closest point to view. This object travelled in a straight line.. What's also interesting is a large grayish-white jet flying in from the northwest towards the southeast towards the UFO. The jet was dispensing one hell of a chemtrail and talk about rainbows just behind the jets trail. This jet looked military with a longer wings span, travelling about the same altitude as the UFO. We watch the UFO continue east, as the jet intersected behind the UFO's flight path. The jet was slightly turning more to a southeast away from the object. Makes you wonder if chemtrails are used to blanket crisp clear blue skies in obstructing vision of UFO's. The good news is I snapped a picture, the bad news is, it's a disposable and there was no image found when developed. But at least I have a witness, and it's his first sighting. The speed of the UFO seem that like a Cessna, and lasted about 5-7 minutes.Following September 22 at approx: 11:00 a.m.,I noticed low flying black military helicopter over head flying due south and turning east. One thing to note was September 21, 2004 is on a new quarter moon. What was very noticable,  is that this thing, followed along a thick chemtrail line just quarter mile south and few thousand feet above. I thought to share this sighting due that it happened exactly 5 years ago today. I understand that a day later on Sept.22, 2004. That Cleveland, Ohio had many reports of UFO's. Witnesses there observed the military on the ground, as well the skies in the early morning through the day.  Could there have been a connection to my sighting here a day earlier ?

I am a sceptic but seeing is beleiving;2010-11-11 08:26:00;1;I am a sceptic but seeing is beleiving   Me and my wife were walking our dogs when she saw a orange light in the sky.  I then looked up and saw what I told her was a shooting star.   Shortly after I realized it wasn't and I saw the object turn from orange to white to red and disappear.  We were both baffled and lost for words.;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934

I noticed a orangish red light size of a basketball moving southernly direction. I stared at the object as it moved slowly and its path changed and curved towards my location stopping about 40 feet from me the moving west and south around the building and out of eye sight. I would like to point out my internal dialogue seemed connected object in some way. As i saw it initially and watched it I knew it was not an aircraft and internally wished it would come closer, the object seemed to hear my internal voice and curved towards me.  As it stopped short about 40 feet from me I was a little scared and internally verbalized that Jesus was my lord and savior, at this point the object moved away west and then at edge of building south again.  I also heard a voice say it is nothing as it started moving away a female voice but it was internal not external. I could not see or hear any motor device.  The light was not solid it was a flickering reddish orange with hints of white. This event has really freaked me out a little. My location is Birchmount and Sheppard ave in Scarborough Ontario.  The object was first spotted near Birchmount and Bonis heading south.;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934

Flashing, color changing lights in sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star??  PD));2014-09-24 04:11:00;2 hours;flashing, color changing lights in sky As I went to bring out my garbage this morning I noticed bright colors in the sky. I stood there for about 10 minutes, begining to think I was crazy. I called my friend to come over to see the changing of colors, on which appeared to be very over sized stars. The sky was clear and the stars were bright but 5 stood out large as they were flashing yellow, white, green, red. Turns out not only did I see this but so did my friend.  The objects were flashing colors and would appear to be moving very slowly, then jump across the sky. We watched this up until 6:00, then decided to go inside.  I managed to get a few video's of this.;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934
((HOAX??))  I noticed a very bright light burning in the sky outside my window.  ((anonymous report));2018-09-06 22:13:00;140 minutes;On the night of September 6, 2018, @ 22:13, noticed a very bright light burning in the sky outside my window.  It was seemed to be north of Bluffers Park, east of Kingston Road in Scarborough Ontario.   It was so bright, it lit up the lake.   After trying to rule out any rational explanation, several more appeared and they hovered.  Some would burn brighter, and others would change colours.  They would disappear and reappear over the span of two hours.  Also noticed dark blue lights after filming the sighting.  They seemed to be in a U pattern.  It was very dark over the lake, so I didnâ€™t notice the blue lights with my own eyes, luckily my camera captured it.   They also would dim out and light up.  Very interesting to watch.;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934
