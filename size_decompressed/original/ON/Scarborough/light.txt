9 --11 rusty red bands of light materialize and then dematerialize in stages above work roof;2003-08-29 13:15:00;3-4 minutes;9 --11 rusty red bands of light materialize and then dematerialize in stages above work roof  On the Friday,  August 29,2003. While in Scarborough,Ontario at work there. I came outside for a smoke break at about 1:10pm. The day was quite warm and clear blue sky with a slight haze high above. Within about five minutes while observing the sky above my workroof -facing north. Three red rusty round lights  materialized over my work roof at about roughly less  than one thousand feet in altitude. These lights than changed in size and shape that formed a longer band in shape. In description they appeared in length maybe 20-50 ft long-in a vertical position  In width would be about 5-10 feet. They were a bright  rusty  red light with a obvious light intensity. I then screamed for a coworker near by to come out and see this display after about  one minute. As the coworker came out and looked up above the roof.He also could see the display of unknown aerial light anomalies. After about 10-15 seconds. We together observed three more appear from nowhere into the group of three. Now the count being six light anomalies above in total. Then after another 30 seconds. Another three-five bands of light materialized before our eyes. Now there are 9 or as many in total 11. Both I and the witnessed were quite in a state of shock in what we were witnessing. Now as we watched this group of rusty red bands of light just sitting still in a  group of 9 bands -maybe 11. It happened so fast in this stunning spectale to observe. Within about 40 seconds later. A small white LOW flying commerical jet came in the direction where these light  anomalies were stationary. Here comes the shocker to this observation of the pure bizarre. As the jet came directly at the light anomalies. These bands of light together moved ahead slowly, as one group forward towards us. The ones in front dematerialized -like going through a invisible door. The rest still visable followed all in about 10 -15 seconds and vanished before our eyes. This happened as before the jet flew directly at them where they once were sitting. My coworker was totally in shock, as he went back inside the workplace. I stayed outside for another 10 minutes and witnessed nothing more. I looked for the witness in our place of work. He was indeed in a DEEP state of shock. He did NOT want to talk about it ANY FURTHER what he witnessed with me. One thing to note that the following work day on Monday -he could not talk. As if he lost his voice. PLEASE NOTE: At the end of the day to go home there was another TYPE of intense white plasma light sighting directly above following me in the car. I will send this to you, as it is another separate report that should be told. It was one of the strangest sightings I've ever witnessed. Sorry it took this long to report this sheer paranormal sighting observed to you. I truly believe this sighting confirms another type of  level of higher intelligence. ie Craft not included -they did not appear solid. I have to question the timing of the jet 's presence also. Added with it's low altitude over my roof. Did someone know that fast of a possible contact/abduction about to happen on the ground ?  Very strange event to witness for anybody.;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934
following daytime  intense bright white plasma light with no form overhead;2003-08-29 17:10:00;8-10 minutes;following daytime  intense bright white plasma light with no form overhead   On Friday, August 29th 2003. While at my workplace earlier to this report. A coworker and myself witnessed 9-11 bands of pure rusty red intense lights  materialize and dematerialize over our work roof about 1000 ft at approx 1:15pm. This SECOND sighting that I'm about to report to you. Is obviously connected, as to complete both parts sent to you. After work that day at 5:00pm to go home. I was at the intersection of Birchmount and Progress to make a left hand turn-north  on Birchmount Road at about 5:10pm. While sitting at the red light traffic light . I looked up through my open sunroof to the sky. My mouth and nerves dropped of what I was witnessing. The sky was blue, yet had haze high above. I could see a blazing of white light with no form. Like a bright star in the day  It was very difficult to tell how high this type of plasma light was in elevation. Though I'd say 1000's of feet to guess. It stuck out like a sore thumb in the sky-it was simply magnificent to witness. It was like looking at a welder's torch. As I watched in disbelief, a motorist next to me. He looked up to see what I was witnessing through his side window of the driver's side. The traffic light then changed green and I made my left turn. I felt so pumped up with now this second sighting occurring directly overhead  Great now I'm being follow by a higher presence ?  I kept driving north to the next main intersection without looking up, as I was  starting to shake with fright  Until I stopped at the next intersection light at Lawrence Ave/Birchmount at the red light. Curious,I looked up again through my sunroof. This blazing white intense light is still over me. I can tell you there is NO other TYPE feeling than this inside you happening to  anyone described in observation. The fascination //excitement from the first sighting. Brought fright and uncertainty of being NOW followed going home happening here. This was not a solid object or any KIND of light ever I had ever witnessed during  the day. After the traffic light changed green to go. I never again looked up til I got home in Oshawa Ontario. I have seen some strange objects/crafts and other strange paranormal activity  throughout my life. But this TYPE of aerial display really had floored me. As I'm sure it would do to others emotionally if in my shoes as an OBSERVER to all  this unknown aerial display. I truly believe these two reports submitted to you today. Reveals that there are indeed LEVELS of HIGHER intelligence around our realm here. Again to say it = craft NOT included. Just pure light ~  If you or any field investigator can help OUT in this information-I'm open. PS I feel a little shaky writing to you of the event remembered;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934

Near Stationary White Light Fading In and Out;2012-08-29 09:57:00;9 minutes;Near Stationary White Light Fading In and Out Today , Wednesday , August 29th 2012 while at work in Scarborough I noticed a lot of dusk coming from next door’s construction.  So I popped out outside curious to have a look see at 9:57am. As I looked up in the clear blue sky slightly northwest. From about a half mile away from where I stood At about a good five to ten thousand feet in altitude  I could see a near stationary bright white light source. As it appeared to be moving  very slow, almost stationary The intensity of the light would lessen on and off After watching this spectacle for about 30 seconds . I ran into my workplace to retrieve my camera  Once back outside in less than 30 seconds with my camera looking up . I took seventeen still shots along with a couple of video clips within five minutes  One coworker came out as I tried to bring it to his attention Without looking up – he said it’s a plane !  And continued to walk away for his daily morning break walk. This object was now after nine minutes observed Moving southwest towards Toronto. It just faded out before my eyes due to distance I came back inside work Found out our Company Server went down at the same time as the sighting. Being very excited to see my second UFO daylight sighting today for 2012 Along with many pictures which I took with the adjoining building used in the picture as a marker. I thought how much photographic evidence I’ll have of this one.  Here’s the real shocker to this story : During lunch break I looked on the computer and was shocked that only one picture was captured to what I had witnessed.  There were no other images to be found of the other 16 still shots taken- very strange . It was bright enough of a light to pick –up in the photos  I had hoped to have some good pictures taken of this light object witnessed. Now I just wonder why ?  This goes on later that day to another daylight sighting much closer  At about 2:00pm I was on the other side of the building where our parking lot is located. I stepped outside and look up and about Noticing instantly a strange brilliant white colored flickering square shaped object.  I then yelled for a coworker to come out and see this thing As the coworker reach me outside. He also could see it due to being so low and close The witness said O- that’s a kite. I explained to him that it moved over our parking lot heading to the north. Not a kite ! As he watched on with me for another minute He then concluded  it’s not a kite He was now not so sure to confirm what it could be ?  It’s altitude was quite low at maybe five- hundred feet above. The sighting lasted about two minutes to when I first witnessed it ! Unfortunately I did not have my camera on me As I just remained watching it’s movements and shape being almost square like flickering Maybe some type of probe ?  I’m now at a point of what’s next if I continue to look up.  The timing to looking for unknowns have been certainly uncanny *  You will found the bright white UFO if you zoom top left on the picture.  Again really odd in witnessing all these UFO sightings day and night * Very busy in our skies showing a sign of a presence  THANKS ONCE AGAIN FOR YOU INTEREST AS I FEEL THIS ‘ MUST ‘ BE SHARED.;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934
