Low Flying Dark Roundish Flashing White Light Object.;2016-07-08 15:14:00;13 minutes;Low Flying Dark Roundish Flashing White Light Object On July 8, 2016, I was on afternoon break in Scarborough, Ontario.  There were some co-workers also outside chatting and joined the group  After about five minutes while chatting with one co-worker Later the other two co-workers went back inside Looked north of our position about a mile away - just a little east Noticed a low dark roundish object flashing a bright white light moving couple of hundred feet high at 3:14 pm It was moving low coming in from the east heading west at maintaining about the same altitude less than two hundred feet Speed a guess would about ten- twenty MPH It's movements appeared strange as well a bright white flashing light 's intensity I alerted my friend and we both instantly ran through the parking lot north at about seventy yards and stopped and looked up towards it It was now straight in front of us to the north The object was near stationary about less than one mile away I then started to film it while it was stationary Also strange had to point the object to the co-worker who took near a full minute to finally see it ! He stood beside and now could see it near stationary Now it started to rise vertical then stop and hang stationary flashing this bright white light It just continued to climb straight up higher and higher With it's altitude is now at least one thousand feet . Then we now had another co-worker join in witness this strange dark flashing round object - two witnesses He came up behind us and said ' look a flying donut ' ! About every minute now passing by It just continued to climb higher and higher would stop at intervals again remain stationary flashing for about thirty seconds or more ? Being so high without the flashing you would NOT be able to see it at that point The object continued climbed so high We could all no longer see it - gone !  I have attached seven of the best - zoomed in pictures before it rose thousands of feet in about one minute As well a short video clip that captures this unknown The sighting ended at 3:27 pm by the last picture time stamp taken Sighting lasted approximately 13 minutes;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934
