While now heading for lunch in Scarborough.I sat at a red light, at the intersection of Comstock and Warden-westward direction.I looked up to the north and noticed a brilliant white object about quarter mile away.The altitude had to be half a mile up there.I immediately grabbed my camera and started to film this white unknown.It was moving westward -very slowly,heading towards the clouds.I watched and filmed away for under a minute.I then video taped it for a few seconds.Then the traffic light changed green.I then focused in driving on to lunch.  Later at lunch, I reflected in disbelief what it was I had been witnessing.  All one can do is film,get witness/s and report to folks like you.I'm still a little bit shaken up again,while I write this third report to you. Thanks again for your site in revealing -We are NOT alone * Images to follow *~* PMS;43.775056616052;-79.2355054229934
