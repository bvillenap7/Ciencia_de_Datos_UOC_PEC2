Star burst;2007-06-20 22:15:00;2 minutes;Star burst Looking at the night sky (north) around 10:15 PM I noticed a point of light about the size of an average star moving from N/E to S/W. It took about 2-3 minutes to cross the sky. I assumed it was a satellite. It moved in a wave like motion and at one point it brightly lit up for a second or two.  I've created a small movie in .avi format showing what I saw. The stars are purposely colored red as the object actually looked like a star. Here is the movie link. It will probably expire in a few weeksâ€¦  http://www.sendspace.com/file/k7z92b;43.7987;-79.4816
