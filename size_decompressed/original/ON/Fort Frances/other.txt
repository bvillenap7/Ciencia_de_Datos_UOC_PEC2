metallic, silent cylinders dropped silently and moved off;1979-08-01 16:20:00;3-5min;metallic, silent cylinders dropped silently and moved off as my family played badminton on lawn they called me out to identify an aircraft(i was the family airplane nut).the craft(?)descended vertically spinning silently on its axis.don't know how/when they first noticed it but i saw the last few hundred feet of its descent.it stopped at approx. 1200-1300ft. altitude for 2-3 sec. and then moved SE until lost to sight. it was cylindrical with two shorter cylinders of the same dia. attached laterally at the back.the long cylinder seemed approx. 25' long. the two shorter ones about 10-12'long. it was a dull metallic colour-no markings visible. due to the sunlight and shadow i could not ascertain any windows/engines ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
