Red white and yellow oval shaped object hovering in the sky;2014-08-08 21:00:00;1-2 minutes;Red white and yellow oval shaped object hovering in the sky The unidentified object was an oval shape like many typical UFO's . It was across the street behind some other houses and it went across the sky lower than a plane would be and slowly stopped and hovered by some trees it then moved a bit and disappeared behind the trees it was by. The object had flashing lights that were red white and yellow. It hovered for about a few seconds then disappeared behind the trees. Also my neighbours dog was out and was barking crazy at the object in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));48.6393;-93.4469

I stepped out on my deck with a cup of coffee looking up at the sky. I saw 3 balls of light in the sky over Fort Frances, ON at first I tried adjusting my eyes but then another ball of light went from south to north and disappeared. I ran in to get my phone and held video on the spot and and another ball came into view traveling from west to east then it disappeared. I have the last one on video. I will be out again tomorrow morning to see if it reappears.;48.6393;-93.4469
