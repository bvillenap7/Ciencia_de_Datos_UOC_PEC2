Object adjacent to funnel cloud in Fort Frances, Ontario on July 1st 2002;2002-01-07 12:38:00;unknown;Object adjacent to funnel cloud in Fort Frances, Ontario on July 1st 2002 On July 1st at 12:38 hours I was photographing a funnel cloud that had just passed by Fort Frances.  The sky very dark.  I took two digital photos in less than a minute period.  In the second photo an object was visible over the neighbours house.  I was facing in a Northerly direction when taking the photo.  It was about two weeks later when I downloaded the data to my computer.  In the  photo there is a definite shape of something that was not visible through the lcd display.  When I increase the magnification of the object it appears to be disc-like in configuration. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness was kind enough to forward a digital copy of the photo.  The object in question, in the photo NUFORC received, is small, and ambiguous.  We have not analyzed it, but it could be a bird, we believe.  The photo is not distinct enough for us to establish what the object is.  PD));48.6393;-93.4469
