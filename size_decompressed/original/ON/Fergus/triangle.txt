3 UFO's spotted in Ontario;2001-07-08 23:00:00;30 seconds;3 UFO's spotted in Ontario While looking at Mars, 3 UFO's entered our line of site in perfect formation. After approx. 10 seconds, the 3rd on the left broke away from the formation. 10 seconds later, the 2 remaining in formation drew extremely close together....closer than a sattelite or aircraft would ever dare. Approx. 5 secconds later, the 3rd rejoined the formation, and then all 3 disappeared from sight, having passed across the entire horizon. These objects were yellow/orange in color, and, as stated by an 11 year old witness, looked like bats.;43.6979;-80.3619
