Orange silent light travelling over Tillsonburg ON;2011-07-31 00:10:00;2 min;Orange silent light travelling over Tillsonburg ON At approximately 12:10 am July 31, 2011, a small group of three of us were walking down Broadway Street located in a small town called Tillsonburg, located in Ontario Canada just leaving a local grocery store.  We just happened to be passing a local eatery on our way home when one of us happened to point to the sky at a hovering orange/red circular light.   We were all looking up at this object for approximately 2 minutes as we watched it hover silently in a relaxed pace, but also not moving in a direct planned path it seemed just as a commercial or military aircraft would.   As the UFO moved closer into our direction the light became more separated into four different lights surrounding one light in the middle, and was bigger than a star.   There were no tailing lights like a burning piece of space debris would possibly carry behind.  It was a cloudy night, and the object was beneath the clouds clearly. As we watched the object fly over the town away from us, it asc! ended up into the clouds to disappear.   As the UFO traveled over our heads about 30 degrees from our direction (west then traveled southeast), there was absolutely no sound coming from the sky such as noises that would come from a plane or jet engine.   We are definitely baffled as to what this could have been, but can only be described as an unidentified flying object.;42.8544541666667;-80.7303604166667
