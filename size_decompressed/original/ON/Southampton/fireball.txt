Bright orange lights seen over Lake Huron.;2012-08-14 21:25:00;4 minutes;Bright orange lights seen over Lake Huron. The western sky was not completely dark when I saw from my back garden, two steady, very bright orange lights over Lake Huron near the mouth of the Saugeen River at Southampton.   At first, I thought they were two aircraft with extremely bright running lights, but they were stationary.   Then one began to move away from the other and suddenly disappeared completely.   The second light moved slowly to where the first one had disappeared, then it, just as suddenly as the first, disappeared also.   There was no sound of engines.  Iâ€™ve seen many aircraft at night before, and these lights were completely different.  The entire episode lasted about four minutes.;44.4995;-81.3652
