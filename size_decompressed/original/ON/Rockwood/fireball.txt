Triangle of orange lights being followed by another brighter orange light moving strangely.;2014-01-31 21:00:00;10 minutes;Triangle of orange lights being followed by another brighter orange light moving strangely. My family was inside when my father saw 3 red balls in the sky in the shape of a triangle.  I looked out and saw them too, so we went to the back door to get a better look.  We opened the door and listened to see if they made sound, which they didn't.  They were in the sky to the north of us moving east.  We ran out front to try and get a better look.  When we got to the front there was only one brighter light.  The neighbour was outside walking his dog so we asked if he saw it too.  He didn't see the 3 lights but he did see the one brighter light.  My father and I ran to the end of the street where there was a park and no houses to block our view.  The light seemed to fade in and out until it faded out and didn't come back on.  We went home and my mother, who was taking a bath at the time of the sighting, told us she saw the whole thing from the bathroom window.  She said the triangle of 3 lights flew away and then a larger brighter light followed them.  She said the l! arger light vibrated up and down, stopped moving, and kept flying in mid air.;43.6206;-80.1351
