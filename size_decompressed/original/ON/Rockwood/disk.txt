I was driving home from work on October 23, 2003, when I saw two bright lights in the distance above a corn field. I first I thought it was a plane, but as I got closer I began to see more lights that went in a circular shape. The lights were red, blue and yellow. It was really low and I could see the bottom of the saucer shaped object as I got closer. It was too low and to quiet to be a plane. I just watched it because I was too scared to get out or my car to get a better look. Since I was almost home I watched it through the side window of my car and when I got home I jumped out and ran inside completely shaken up!;43.6206;-80.1351
