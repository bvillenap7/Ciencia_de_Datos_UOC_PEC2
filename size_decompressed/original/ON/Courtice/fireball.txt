Large slow moving flickering fireball.;2014-06-14 22:20:00;5 minutes;Large slow moving flickering fireball We were sitting in my garage.  I noticed a large object coming toward us.  It looked like a large ball of very orange fire.   I waited a minute to tell my friends who did not notice it at first.  Once I did we were all in awe as it was very unusual.  It was quite large and slow moving at first.  It processed in our direction.   We watched and took a video as it flew over us and kept heading in a south ward direction.  It then started to flicker and sped up very fast so it was a small dot in the sky then disappeared.   We continued to look for it for a few seconds and it did reappear briefly then finally dissapeared for good.   We took a video of it flying over us.;43.8942;-78.7652
