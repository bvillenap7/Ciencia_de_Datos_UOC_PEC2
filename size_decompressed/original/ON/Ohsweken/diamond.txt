Map coordinates Latitude N 43° 3' 35.263 Longitude W 80° 0' 44.632 is approximately where I pulled my car over.  We both looked to our right (approximately 45-50 degrees NE) at the lights, there were 7, shaped like an elongated diamond.  As a lit up shape, it didn’t appear to be moving.  We watched it for about a minute.  I rolled down my window and heard nothing.  Then, the 7 lights came together and all we saw was 1 light.  This 1 light wasn’t bigger than the 7 lights.  We saw a slight movement and then it disappeared.  We didn’t see it fly away, it just vanished.  I don’t know how far away it was or even how high it was.  I did not report this to my local police.;43.0685;-80.122
