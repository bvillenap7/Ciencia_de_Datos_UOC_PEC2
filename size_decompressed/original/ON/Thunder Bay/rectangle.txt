Rectangular, grey, silent object passing over Thunder Bay, Ontario on August 17th.;2005-08-17 03:00:00;30 seconds?;Rectangular, grey, silent object passing over Thunder Bay, Ontario on August 17th. This was a UFO to me, but maybe there's an explanation for it.  My husband thinks it might have been the bottom of the space station . . .  I was looking for the Perseid meteors, and witnessed a grey rectangle cross the night sky smoothly, from west to east.  It was silent.  It looked like the flap from a cardboard box.   It gave off no light of its own, just reflected some light from Earth.   I don't know how big it was because I don't know how far away it was.   It took about 30 seconds to pass completely out of view.  I've viewed a lot of night skies, and have never seen anything like it. It wasn't spectacular, just kind of interesting.   I'd like to know what it was.;48.4143715736041;-89.2710563451778
