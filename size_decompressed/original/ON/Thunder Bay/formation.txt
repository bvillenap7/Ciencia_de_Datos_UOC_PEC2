formation of 10 lights in a straight line moving at a rather fast pace  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-08-13 05:23:00;60 seconds;While watching to see perhaps a meteor shower, my eyes noticed a formation of 10 lights in a straight line moving at a rather fast pace and definitely not a group of birds as they line maintained straight travel from a North to East.  At about 30 seconds of viewing ,  one light broke formation and looped back to the direction the lights came from and disappeared.  The other lights continued on and within 60 seconds I could no longer see them.  I’m 52 years old and was amazed as I’ve never seen anything like it.  The lights were like stars.;48.4143715736041;-89.2710563451778
