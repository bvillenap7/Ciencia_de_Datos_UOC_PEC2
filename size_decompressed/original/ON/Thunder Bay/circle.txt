MY WIFE AND ME WERE OUT CAMPING AT  FRAZER LAKE  NEAR THUNDER BAY ONTARIO CANADA, WHEN ONE NIGHT I WENT OUT SIDE OF CAMPER TO GO TO WASHROOM. AS I STOOD BEHIND THE CAMPER I LOOKED UP AND NOTICED A VERY  BRIGHT WHITE ROUND LIGHT IN THE SKY, ABOUT 2000 FEET  FROM THE GROUND. THE HEIGHT IS VERY HARD TO TELL BECAUSE THE LIGHT WAS SO BRIGHT. THE DISTANCE AWAY FROM ME WAS MAYBE 1 QUARTER  MILE AWAY. I WAS AMAZED AND WATCHED IT SLOWLY MOVE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT SILENTLY.  IT REALLY GOT ME THINKING WHEN THE LIGHT JUST STOPPED AND HOVERED THERE IN FRONT OF ME. NOW I WAS REALLY THINKING WHAT THE HELL IS THAT LIGHT.  IT STOPPED FOR ABOUT 10 SECONDS   THEN SLOW STARTED MOVING AGAIN IN THE SAME  DIRECTION AND SUDDENLY TURNED A BRIGHT ORANGE COLOUR AND DISAPEARED INTO NOWHERE WITHIN A SECOND.  AFTER A FEW MOMENT OF THINKING ABOUT IT I QUICKLY RAN INSIDE MY CAMPER AND TOLD MY WIFE WHAT I HAD SEEN AND LOCKED THE  DOOR. I WAS SO SCARED I COULDNT SLEEP ALL NIGHT AND THE NEXT DAY I ASKED OTHER CAMPERS IF THEY HAD SEEN THIS LIGHT BUT NOBODY HAD BEEN OUTSIDE AT THAT TIME. I HAD BEEN SCEPTICAL ABOUT UFO SIGHTINGS UNTIL I HAD SEEN THIS UNEXPLAINED LIGHTED ROUND OBJECT. I HAVE SINCE ENCOUNTERED 2 MORE SIGHTINGS IN WHICH ONE I HAVE 2 WITNESSES BUT THAT DOSENT MATTER. I BELIEVE THERE IS OTHER LIFE OUT THERE OTHER THAN THE HUMAN RACE AND THATS ALL THAT COUNTS. I AM TRUELY INTERESTED IN ALL SIGHTINGS AND BELIEVE MOST OF THEM TO BE TRUE SIGHTINGS.

Bright fireball in the sky;2012-07-01 23:45:00;10 minutes;Bright fireball in the sky On July 1 2012 my 2 daughters, a co worker, and I were leaving my office when spotted a bright light in the sky.  We stopped our vehicle and continued to observe this light as it appeared to be getting closer to us.  At first we thought it may be an approaching airplane on fire as it was in a direction that airplanes normally approach the Thunder Bay airport.  I did not observe flashing lights from the wings so it couldnt be an airplane. The object continued to get closer and brighter, lights flickering, appeared to stop for around 15 seconds and we could see it was definitely not an airplane.  The object then appeared to turn 90 degrees and travel at an extremely hight rate of speed westbound in to the sky.  We watched the object unitl its path went behind a montuain top. My daughter captured a video of the object on her Iphone.;48.4143715736041;-89.2710563451778
