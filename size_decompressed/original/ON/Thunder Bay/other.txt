TWO DISTINCT STARS THE FRONT STAR SHOWN A BEAM FORWARD ACROSS THE SKY.VERY CLEAR OUT PLEASE CONTACT ME ASAP THANK YOU.;2001-07-22 03:53:00;1 min. 30 s.;TWO DISTINCT STARS THE FRONT STAR SHOWN A BEAM FORWARD ACROSS THE SKY.VERY CLEAR OUT PLEASE CONTACT ME ASAP THANK YOU. At approx. 3:53 am, I saw over my head two bright stars about 2 inches apart. It was moving due north, at a medium fast-pace, faster than a plane and slower than a sattelite. The stars were not flashing, but contilnually emitted light. The first of the two stars was emitting a bright light towards the horizon. It made no noticeable noise. This sighting was made at Barnum Lake, near Thunder Bay, Ontario on Sunday morning, on July 22, 2001. After a minuite and a half, it went above the trees and was no longer visible, despite its height. It would have been pursuied, but no roads were available.;48.4143715736041;-89.2710563451778

I'll try to explain this as fast as possible because if you're like me then you like just facts and not a page long story.  It was getting late..about 11pm, and me, my mom and sister were at my grandparents so we decided to get driving home. We we're driving down the street, a moderatley busy one in fact, and we stopped at the red light. When we stopped, my mom had seen a set of bright lights WAY further (A LOT FURTHER) near the other end of the street, but she didnt say anything about it. THEN, like 5 seconds later, she noticed that the same lights were RIGHT ACROSS the street from us and my mom had se said Hey whats that up there? and i said Where?. She pointed over above these houses across the street, and there was a triangular shaped U.F.O hovering over a house! It had multi-colored lights around the bottom edges, and it was HUGE. We knew it wasnt a plane because of its shape, and we werent anywhere near the airport. Plus, it wasnt even moving at all, it was just sitting there. The light turned green, so we drove up about another 80 feet, and pulled to the side of the road. It was right across the street from us...such an awesome sight! Then we realised, there was a small bright light, aproaching from behind the triangle, and it went inside it!! So im guessing that the triangle shaped thing was the mothership...and the bright light was a smaller ufo. I wanted to get out of the car but my mom locked the door and started speeding away. She finally got the courage to drive back when we reached the end of the street, but it was gone.  Later that night, we had told my aunt about it, and she also has something weird to tell us. At about the same time when she was in her house, she had looked at the time, and it was correct. Then when she looked back about 20 mins later, the time had been set back about 3 hours! But the clock works perfectly fine, batteries and all! Weird or what...? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));48.4143715736041;-89.2710563451778
0:53 or 12:53 am EST, Saturday October 1st 2011, Thunder Bay, ON, T like figure, 4 seconds, dim orange lights, silent  500 Lights On Ob;2011-10-01 00:53:00;4-5 seconds;0:53 or 12:53 am EST, Saturday October 1st 2011, Thunder Bay, ON, T like figure, 4 seconds, dim orange lights, silent  500 Lights On Ob 0:53 or 12:53 am EST, Saturday October 1st 2011, a sighting occurred.  There was somebody right beside me at the time.  I was explaining to her a story about the night sky, when I had this sense something was there.  As i looked back up in the sky after being interrupted, I saw this T like figure, only one side of the T was visible, as in it wasn't a complete T.  There were approximately 9 lights, all very dim.  The possible craft was translucent, silent and using the stars as a camouflage. Only visible for 4 seconds as i glanced down in my amazement to get my friend as a witness, but as I looked up it was gone. I did not however, see how the craft took off.  There are more details i have yet to explain.  As I saw the craft, it started to turn 90 degrees in all directions, left to right, spun from side to side.  It shouldn't have been more than 200-250 feet in the air. The object was almost hovering above me when I looked up.  Relative to the size of the moon, ! it was about 1 1/2 times bigger in comparison. As I spoke to somebody who had previously reported a UFO sighting as well, that person told me to look for anything unusual on my body which I have not done yet. I didn't get ANY documented proof, as it didn't appear on camera. The object looked like this:   0 000 00000. As stated above I couldn't see the craft as it was translucent. I do not know the count of the witnesses around the Thunder Bay area, nor did anybody see the craft at all.  My hair did not stand up, but i did feel like something though was watching me.  I had a tingly back like something was standing over me,and that's when I looked up.  That is as much detail as I can give;48.4143715736041;-89.2710563451778
What looked like Mars only 3 times larger then came down to cruise over as a glowing red/orange fireball craft.;2014-07-30 22:45:00;1 hour;What looked like Mars only 3 times larger then came down to cruise over as a glowing red/orange fireball craft I was coming out of a hotel beside the city's airport and getting into my car when I seen a bright red star up in the east.  I am always looking at the stars being an amateur astronomer kind of guy.  It reminded me of Mars but was way too bright.  My house at 1300 Mary Street West was only a couple of blocks away and when driving home I could still see it high up in the east sky.  The object then moved toward the airport right over my head but was still high up. I called my daughter out of the house to come and see this thing. It flew by us to my surprise I was so happy that I had another witness.  It took off without sound from the big dipper area towards Cassiopeia then disappeared. We waited around to see anything else around when maybe 20 minutes later I seen it or another one come right over a tree in front of my house heading directly east.  We were both amazed as it was very close to ground this time and appeared as a red/orangey fireball as my daughter put it.  It then gained altitude quickly and sped off towards Cassiopeia again and disappeared.  Most remarkable it didn't make any noise and there were no blinking lights like the many aircraft I am used to seeing in my area.  After watching a UFO TV show later I learned of the G force and estimated that the object could have went up to near 20 G's as it disappeared in a speed not possible for mankind.  I thought it could be a drone later but it was too big. It was slightly rectangular in shape and about the size of the bottom of a helicopter.  The remarkable thing was that it did not make any noise even when it flew by over our heads.   As a retiree I have never seen anything like it in my life and decided to do this report as it kept bothering me.;48.4143715736041;-89.2710563451778
