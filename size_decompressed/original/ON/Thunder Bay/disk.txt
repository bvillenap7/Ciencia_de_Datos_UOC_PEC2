We first spotted two main blue disks that were pulsating.  It appears white lights were going towards these two main craft.  Then, it would pulse red and send out these bright white lights.  There appeared to be some immense shape right in the middle of the two main blue disks.  It was like a shadowy fog sometimes, but flash red occasionally. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness does not indicate a date of the sighting, although we believe a date of January 03, 2004, is implied.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  We do not know if this is a serious report.  PD));48.4143715736041;-89.2710563451778
Cloudly except for a circle around the near full moon, which was illuminated in blues and greens, then a saucer appeared;2005-10-15 23:40:00;2 minutes;Cloudly except for a circle around the near full moon, which was illuminated in blues and greens, then a saucer appeared On October 15, 2005, at about 11:40 p.m. the sky was evenly covered in cloud, except there was clear sky around the near full moon. The moon was radiating a beautiful array of colour around it.   I quickly got my digital camera and took 5 pictures.  The array of colours remained until the 5th picture, when illuminated clearly below and to the right of the moon was a blue and green saucer.   Some of the clocks in the house immediatley showed the wrong time and the bedroom light did not work after that.  I changed the bulbs, checked the breakers, but still no lights.  Will have to wait for my husband to get home on the weekend to check out the bedroom light closer. I have 5 digital pictures of the event.
