This took place on a moose hunting trip, 80 mile's north east of Thunder Bay, ontario, canada. We observed an object across a lake from us , probably a few mile's in the bush from said lake. It was aprox. 8:30 at nite, it had 4 light's on it , blue, red, green, and amber. It seemed to just sit there , i guess about 1/2 mile above tree line. We could'nt figure out what it was, and all of a sudden it just veered straight up, i would say from the long distance it was from us, 1/2 a mile straight up, then it would go down. It moved to fast for an aircraft. The background was total darkness. Binocular's were used on it, that's what determined the light colour's. When i got home(1000 mi. away) my mother told me it was on the new's that week, and it was the military testing equipement.  There is no way that the Canadian millitary has something that moved as fast as i observed, as a matter of fact any government. It lasted for about 15 min. and then just disappeared.

We were driving and saw motion in the sky then dissappeared.;2001-09-02 22:50:00;1 minute;We were driving and saw motion in the sky then dissappeared. We just finished driving a friend home after a movie. Me, the driver spotted a small object high in the sky. At first we all thought it was a plane but since my father is an avid aviator I knew that it wasn't anything like the sort. It was heading left in our field of vision then, raised and fell. Since we were going down a hill it left bwehind some trees, but when we crested the next hill to investigate it was gone. There was NO chance of it still being behind the trees for this hill was very high and had a good overlook of the city. The craft was hard to determine its's actual shape for the sky was dark but clear. Anyway the way the lights were flahing it looked circular in shape. All passengers in the car are high school students.;48.4143715736041;-89.2710563451778
