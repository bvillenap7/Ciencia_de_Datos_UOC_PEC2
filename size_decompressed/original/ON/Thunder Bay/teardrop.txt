2 white glowing metallic tear drop shaped objects over Thunder Bay;2008-06-01 23:15:00;2 minutes;2 white glowing metallic tear drop shaped objects over Thunder Bay My wife and I were driving west on the dirt road protion Paquette road when we noticed a bright white light travelling at a high rate of speed coming from the west heading east.  Its speed was equal to a jet fighter.  It was sort of circular when heading towards us.  We stopped the van and got out to watch.  As it passed over us a second one follwing a same parallel path about 40 meters difference approached and passed over us.  Unlike the first object that went over our heads, the second one was more off of the road so we got to see it more from the side.  It seemed to have a slight more of a rounding at the front and tapered slightly like a tear drop point at the rear.  I estimate that it was roughly 1 kilometer in the air. And was a small craft that could possibly hold 1-3 people if possible, or possibly its automated.  The entire object was illuminated, there was no single point of light or flashing lights, it was fairly bright and consistent all around the object making it seemingly glow.  Inside the glow it was a perfect metallic object, as if it were one complete piece, with no visible wings, tail fin, etc.  There was also about a 10-20 meter tail trailing behind the object, like a jet stream about less than half the size of the object, which re-assured my guesstimate about the object's size and distance and that it must be travelling through the atmosphere.  There was no noise from the object as it approached, went past us and beyond our visiblilty.  They were heading east directly over Thunder Bay and in the direction of Lake Superior, possibly travelling between 140 to 180 kilometers per hour.  I keep going outside to see if I can see them again.  During the time we were pulled over I kept flickering my headlights to get its attention, but it didn't work.;48.4143715736041;-89.2710563451778
