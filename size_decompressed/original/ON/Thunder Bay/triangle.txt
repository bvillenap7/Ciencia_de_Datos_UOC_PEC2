Indiglo coloured, triangle shaped craft that was visible for 30 seconds.;1998-03-07 01:00:00;20seconds;Indiglo coloured, triangle shaped craft that was visible for 30 seconds. I saw one object that I can compare to a stealth bomber aircraft in shape. It was teh brightest thing in the sky and the coulour was unique. The best way I can describe the colour is that of an Indiglo watch. It was seen by me, a then senior in high school. It was moving slowly in the sky, slower than an airplane for about 15 seconds, it then picked up speed and took off. ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report. PD));48.4143715736041;-89.2710563451778
We saw 3 stars formed in a long triangle moving together for 1 minute, then just suddenly stop and disappear.  ((NUFORC Note:  NOSS?));2004-09-07 00:30:00;1 minute;We saw 3 stars formed in a long triangle moving together for 1 minute, then just suddenly stop and disappear. It was a triangle, a long triangle of 3 stars, moving in one direction.  We thought satellite at first cause we can see them on clear nights, but we have never seen 3 of them move in complete unison.  Then we thought it was a plane but I know there is no aircraft that is that large to be seen that high in the sky. I have seen many planes in the sky at night and none have ever even come close to that size. It would've appeared at least 5 times smaller, but these 3 stars we saw moving were very high in the sky and were clearly not a plane.  I don't know of any plane that has 3 stars attached to it at perfect angles. It moved for about one minute then just stopped.  The night was still clear and you could see all the other stars, but the 3 stars we saw stopped completely and we didn't see them again. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have observed the three satellites that frequently are reported to our Center.  They are thought to be a triplet of satellites, which may be associated with the U. S. Navy NOSS satellite system.  PD));48.4143715736041;-89.2710563451778
