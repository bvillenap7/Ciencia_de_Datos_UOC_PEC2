Flashing row of lights;1979-03-15 18:00:00;3-5 minutes;Flashing row of lights I would have been 9 or 10 years old and was outside near twilight getting firewood for the house. In the southern sky over the nearby hills/mountains, I saw a flashing row of multiple white lights, one larger/brighter light in the center and smaller/dimmer ones out to the sides in the formation of &quotwing&quot of an aircraft approaching you.  Like this * * * * # * * * * with the &quot#&quot representing the center bigger light. I would judge that the object was at least the size of a C-130 or larger sized aircraft....It's hard to judge as it never seemed to get closer/larger. The lights alternated on and off through out the row including the center and seemed to &quotbank&quot left and right around the center light.  The lights disappeared (or went out) for a brief period, came back on for a few more flashing patterns and then disappeared completely. We lived near an airport but and I was/still am an avid plane watcher so can make the distiction between aircraft and something else.  There were far too many lights in the row for typical aircraft landing lights.  The area is not a normal flight approach to the airport and the lights did not get closer or further away but seemed stationary in the distance.  There was no sound. I have been around aircraft all my life and cannot explain what I saw as any type of aircraft that I know or have seen.  Never ever told anyone of the event........just found the website and decided it was time to tell someone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
