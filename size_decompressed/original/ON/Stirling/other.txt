When I went out for a better look I noticed a closer and much brighter version of the same shape.  It was very bright and I think it was shaped like a dome which was a white light and it had a reddish short, straight line directly emmiting from below it.  There was no sound at all from either object.  Sometimes the light would disappear.  When this happened it did not just shut off, but fade out gradually then return in the same fashion.  These objects were moving slowly in a north west direction.  The white light seemed to look a little wider than it was in height, almost like a mushroom cap.;44.2987;-77.5456
