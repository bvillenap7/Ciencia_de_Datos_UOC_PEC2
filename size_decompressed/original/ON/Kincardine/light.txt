While sitting on a quiet beach on Lake Huron, after dark, just star gazing, we noticed a series of four lights in a straight line  just above the horizon.  These lights did not move, but just appeared, and flashed in a sequence.  They were like spot lights, orange and red in colour.  After about thirty seconds, they just disappeared.  About five minutes later, another light appeared higher in the sky, same colour, but this one moved in an upward direction, like a flare.  Only it originated high in the sky.  A second light appeared almost immediately, slightly lower.  With the same motion upward, they both disappeared.  At this point, the lake is about sixty miles wide and there are no obstructions.  I often see numerous jets and planes, but none have ever looked like this.  The night was totally clear, with a slight wind.  There were some waves so I didn't notice any sounds.  I was with a friend and he saw the same thing.;44.1664;-81.6010000000001
