Observed while stargazing in the hottub in windy and partially cloudy conditions were two whitish cigar/rectangular shaped objects flying lockstep in tandem, side by side maintaining a gap between them equal to their own length.  Concealed at first by clouds, seeming to emerge below them perhaps descending to a lower altitude, the pair carried on their southern bearing out of view at a steady rate of speed.  At first mistaken as shooting stars, then thought to be seagulls which typically wouldn't be flying in small numbers at this time of night, no other seagulls were seen in the area.  They looked to be following the western shore of Lake Huron, 1.5 km west of my residence.;44.1664;-81.6010000000001
