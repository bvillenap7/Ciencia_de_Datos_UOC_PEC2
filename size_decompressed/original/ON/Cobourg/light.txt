Two satellites traving S in tandem, then reversing direction and travelling north in tandem, then diverging.;2017-04-19 21:45:00;4 minutes;Two satellites travelling south in tandem, then reversing direction and travelling north in tandem, then diverging. April 19, 2017, Approximately 9:45 pm local time. Location:  Cobourg, Ontario, Canada  Visibility: clear. Facing east, observed what appeared to be two satellites, moving in tandem, one behind the other, in a due-south direction, approximately 45 degrees between horizon and zenith. Distance between lights approximately that of Mizar and Alioth of the Big Dipper (Big Dipper was conveniently directly above sighting). No sound. Approximately one minute later, both lights were seen travelling in opposite direction, due north, along same trajectory, again in sync but perhaps further apart. Through binoculars, could follow both clearly. Gradually the lights diverged, one continuing due north, the other heading north-east until both faded from view. Observer is a recording engineer with background in printing and publishing.  Has also observed a sighting in same location in April 2011, where there were three lights in V-shape travelling at high velocity due west.;43.7987769230769;-78.0574824175824
3 separate lights with identical trajectories travel SSE.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-03 21:30:00;5-6 minutes;3 separate lights with identical trajectories travel SSE At approximately 21:30 I was looking at the moon which was in the southern hemisphere approximately 60° above the southern horizon.  The sky was clear.  I noticed what appeared to be a satellite / point-light emerge from the NNW travelling in a SSE direction.  It appeared to be travelling somewhat faster than a typical satellite.  I followed its course for about one minute until it faded from view essentially due south from me, approximately 30° above the southern horizon.  Approximately one minute later, a second satellite / point-light emerged from the same NNW direction with a trajectory and velocity identical to the first light.  Approximately one minute after that, a third satellite / point-light emerged from the same NNW direction again identical to the first two.  There was no sound.  I looked at the third light through handheld binoculars but could not distinguish any features or details.  The fact that all three lights faded from view in the southern hemisphere well above the horizon (perhaps 30° above the horizon) suggested they were at a very high altitude.  Approximately 30 seconds after the third light faded from view, a similar light emerged from the SSE and appeared to travel due north, where it faded from view.;43.7987769230769;-78.0574824175824
