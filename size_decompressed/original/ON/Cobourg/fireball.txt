Orange glow traveling silently at high speed in northwesterly direction.;2013-04-27 21:20:00;1.5 minutes;Orange glow traveling silently at high speed in northwesterly direction. A bright, orange glow, traveling in a northwest direction.  No sound, no visible trail, no blinking lights. High velocity - comparable to how a jet might appear at say, 5,000 feet. Size was approx. 1/4 - 1/5 diameter of the moon. It passed not directly overhead, but approx. 20° to the south of where I stood. As it receded into the northwest distance, it appeared to hover 15 - 20 seconds, although this could be an illusion - its brightness and position seemed to remain constant for that duration. I ran inside and grabbed some binoculars and managed to view it through them, but I could not focus on it - it was simply an orange glow. It gradually faded from view well above the horizon, approx. 20° above the horizon.;43.7987769230769;-78.0574824175824
