Cigar-shaped object seen north of Hensall Ontario, crossing the road (at a distance) while driving on Hwy 4;2003-07-13 11:45:00;5 seconds;Cigar-shaped object seen north of Hensall Ontario, crossing the road (at a distance) while driving on Hwy 4 While driving north on Hwy 4 north of Hensall Ontario, I spotted a cigar shaped object crossing the highway.  The object was white.  It travelled from right to left across highway approximately at the horizon, just above the treeline.  The left-most side of the object was slanted downwards and the right-most side was slanted upwards.  The angle was about 15-20 degrees.  I remarked to my wife (sitting next to me) what I saw and if she saw it too.  She did not see it.  I lost sight of it as it continued on it's course behind the trees.  I did not see it again, but continued to look for it.  I'm not sure how far down the road it was from our car but it had to be at least 10km (about 6 miles).  It did not look like a plane, balloon or anything else I have seen in the sky.  It had to be quite large.  I say this because I watched it cross the road in clear view and from my position and it's entire length was visible between the trees on either side of the road!  Someone else must have seen it.  If this turns out to be something easily dismissed, then I'm sorry I wasted your time, but I cannot reconcile what I saw.  If someone can explain it, I would be interested in knowing what it is that I did see.;43.4295;-81.5017
