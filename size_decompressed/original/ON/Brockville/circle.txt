It was grey, with a darker grey circular top and looked very much like what one might have as an image of a flying saucer - it moved smoothly and quickly.  There were no lights.  Initially, I thought it was a remote control device but quickly realized it was way too large, then considered whether it was a military test vehicle of some sort and finally, that it may be a UFO.   Unfortunately, I was on the 401 being passed by transports and could not look to the side when I passed the spot it it had crossed, but thought I would pass the info along in the event someone else saw it.  None of the characteristics below apply.  Windows were up, so no info re sound.   This is about all I can say.;44.5945999999999;-75.6824
