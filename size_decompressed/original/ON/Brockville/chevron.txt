It startled me because i realise that it wasnt more than a few hundred meetres ahead of me, so i frose and just stared at it. trying to take it all in... definately wasnt an aircraft. it was probaly a similar size to a small jet or a large single prop type plane. luckily i had my camera in my pocket, while i was trying to turn it on. i took my eyes off the thing for only a second. and then it was gone! completely dissapeard. at the rate it was moving, it couldnt have moved off into the horison that fast. so i presume that it was one of the following. wasnt a materal object, turned out all its 'lights', i was simply hallucinating (even though i was completely sober), or perhaps it went to ludicrous speed and went over the horison in 2 seconds flat. this is the second UFO that ive seen in my local area, myself.
