Rotating cylinder.;2016-05-30 02:20:00;40 seconds;Rotating Cylinder I first thought the bright light was a satellite.  It was coming from the northeast, heading southeast, and moving very fast.  As the object came nearer, I noticed that it was cylindrical in shape, and seemed to be rotating.  It appeared as though something was revolving around the bottom of the object, and a dimmer light would appear on the bottom left of the object, as it rotated.   The object started heading towards the east, and then I lost sight of it behind some clouds.;44.5945999999999;-75.6824
