Cloaked spacecraft;2002-09-12 01:00:00;seconds;Cloaked spacecraft We decided to walk our usual route home, through a path. As the path came to an end, my friend shouted Look, there! and I ran ahead to see what it was, and to my surprise it was definitely a UFO... because I have no idea what it was that I saw really. But I can describe it. It appeared to me as a horse-shoe shape at the front, and my friend claims it was a triangle, but I only got a glimpse of it. It seemed to be Invisible. The only way I could tell that it was there, is because I could see the space around it glowing a bright white/blue. There were no lights, no jet trails, and no sound. It was moving quite fast, and disappeared behind a house after I got a glimpse of it. My friend that got a better look at the thing claimed that it was going about mach 5, I couldnâ€™t' tell the actual speed, but it was very fast. I explained to another friend what had happened, and he suggested that it was probably cloaked like 'Predator', or a 'Klingon' spaceship'. I am a 20 year old College student, and the other witness is a 23 year old Cook at a local restaurant. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));44.5945999999999;-75.6824
