It seemed bigger than a plane, circular and it changed colour  white to red then green then back This was not a plane, but I don't know what it was.  It was travelling from west to east and it was going very very slowly.  It just took forever to move across the sky.  I observed it for about 15 minutes, I estimate.  It seemed to be bigger than a plane, circular, and either it was rotating or the lights were rotating around it, it was hard to tell.  It changed colour.  It was a blinding white solid, a steady globe.  Then it began to spin, and became brilliantly coloured, red, green, and back to white.  Sometimes a ring of smaller lights flickered and danced all around it but in a type of orbit pattern, not erratic.  When it stopped spinning it went back to a brilliant white colour.  It was very cold that night at least -30 degrees celcius, so it was too risky to set up my telescope, and I was worried that if I went back into the house, I would lose sight of it.  So I just stood there on my front porch watching it.  I know it was not a plane.  I know the way lights behave on a plane and the noise planes make.  It was a quiet night, and this object emitted no noise.  I called my local airport, but no answer.  I called my local police the next day and they said no one had reported anything, and to which I answered, Well I am.  I talked with a local woman who published my sighting in her book, UFO Experiences in Canada.  I wanted to see however if there was a way to get my sighting more international exposure, so this is the path I'm following.;44.5945999999999;-75.6824
