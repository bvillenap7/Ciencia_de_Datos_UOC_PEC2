Brown saucer with red and green lights seen in Brockville, Ontario, Canada.;2013-10-20 02:00:00;Minutes;Brown saucer with red and green lights seen in Brockville, Ontario, Canada. Though I do not recall the exact date, it was roughly 2013-2014, and I believe it was late in the year (around September).  I was in bed and I saw the UFO through my window.  It was, judging by the distance, a seemingly very small craft.  Perhaps the size of a Dodge caravan, maybe bigger. It had metal prongs/legs all around the craft, red and green lights, and the vessel itself was brown in colour with darker brown, thick plates on what seemed to be the front of the vessel (based on the plates facing the direction it was moving).   I opened my window to see if I could hear anything, but I could not.  The UFO was literally, completely silent.  It was not emitting any sort of fog or exhaust, simply hovering as if it were completely defying gravity. The UFO was also extremely slow-moving, moving at ~5 mph.  It moved across the sky in a straight line and then stopped abruptly, perfectly frozen in place, for about 60 seconds before continuing its path.
