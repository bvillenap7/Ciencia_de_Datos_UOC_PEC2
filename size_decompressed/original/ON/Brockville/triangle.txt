It was approximately 9:40 p.m.  I noticed a large, still, white spotlight about 20 feet over a farmhouse which has a barn with cattle beside it.  It was about the same size as a large water search spotlight.  I watched it for about 5 seconds as I drove down the road towards it.  There is an outside streetlamp on this property attached to a hydro pole the light above the house was a much, much brighter light.  I glanced down at the road and then back up to see something directly on the other side.  (The spotlight was not over the house anymore.)  Just above the tree line almost directly on the other side of the road was a triangular shape hovering at the top of the tree line.  I had four lights only on the left side.  The first light was green.  The next three were white.  They were in a straight line.  The lightâ€™s colours looked man made, and not otherworldly.! I watched the triangular, soundless, shape lower down into the tree line for about 5 seconds.  Not wanting to know what exactly it was, I sped up and high-tailed it around the corner to my home.  The last thing I was about to do was stop and take a picture, so sorry about that.;44.5945999999999;-75.6824
