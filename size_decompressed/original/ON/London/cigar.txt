I went outsie to take a cigarette break at about 1:10am, Friday morning, I was standing in the middle of my drive way, when I started that 'Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight' wish and realized it wasn't as a star but a damn bright light. So I watched it coming slowly towards me, it wasn't very high but there wasn't any noise coming from it ....So I watched ...it was so bright though. I was intrrupted by across the street a couple came running out to look at it. It was right over me when it came to a stop...for like 3 secs, with a faint humming sound....There was still no other light except the surrounding glow from the white light (Does this sound like heaven *L*). It's a totally clear night so I could see it was long, from my distance it looked like the size of a huge passanger plane, but no wings, cigar shaped as you explain it!  Then it just took off, faster then when it came, but not remotely fast enough ....still as bright as when it first came. Then I watched it go, but gor freaked out so I ran in the house, as well as all the neighbours did...;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
