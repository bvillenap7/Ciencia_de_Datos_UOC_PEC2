I ;2000-10-07 15:00:00;1 minute;The sky was darkly overcast at the time and while working on the computer something caught my eye about 400 yards to the North East. I have a Penthouse Suite on the 12th Floor. A silver ball appeared with great brightness and then in rapid succession the others came out to join it. They were all the same size and began to dance with each other in a playful manner back and forth it looked like a tag match. The spheres were perfectly round and the silver brightness against the black sky was not a natural light source in the least, but a powerful bright silver. Did anyone in London, Ontario see what I witnessed?;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
Three metallic hotrods crossing the sky in perfect weather.;2000-12-22 14:25:00;10seconds;Three metallic hotrods crossing the sky in perfect weather. They were similar to what I reported months before and am sitting 12 stories high always looking east while working on my computer. This time the sky is cloudless and a normal blue. They were flying in a fixed formation from south to north, bright silver metallic white with clear definition of solid objects. The size at arms length amounted to a quarter of an inch and the speed of travel was shocking. I watch planes flying day and night out of this same window these were not jet aircraft these were hotrods in a hurry. These were the same craft that were reported to you months ago and that time they were stationery and playing tag with each other. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not understand what the witness means when he uses the term, hotrods.  PD));42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
A blue sphere crashes towards the earth, illuminating the sky in a glowing blue light.;2003-04-04 20:00:00;5-10 seconds;A blue sphere crashes towards the earth, illuminating the sky in a glowing blue light. As I was driving eastbound on the 401 towards London, a blue sphere appeared in the sky out of nowhere and accelerated towards the ground behind the treeline.  There was a visble blue streak which tailed the sphere.   Following this, the area of the sky where the object 'crashed' towards was illuminated in a blue light for a good 2-3 seconds.  It could very well have been some type of meteor, but the fact that there was this blue light associated with the object and the illumination of the sky made the event quite strange.   Please keep in mind, though, that this event occured during a barrage of freezing rain, which hampered visibility.  I seem to only remember two or three other cars on the road at the time.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
35-50 moving stars, majority moving NW to SE in a line. 6th sighting in 7 approx. weeks.;2020-05-01 21:45:00;45 minutes;35-50 moving stars, majority moving NW to SE in a line. 6th sighting in 7 approx. weeks. 35-50 moving stars. Many travelling in a straight line but not in the same orientation. Eg. String of 8 to 12 travelling NW to SE, string of 3-5 travelling W to E, etc.  This is the 6th time in approx. 7 weeks, myself and my family have witnessed these strange lights in the sky from our backyard.  It is becoming a nightly look and find.  Tonight was the highest concentration to date.  At least two occurences, a normal aircraft also appeared in the sky, as reference (moving much slower, blinking lights and audible engine noise).  Moving stars are fast, no sound.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
