I noticed what looked to be a star like shaped object, glistening in the sky.;2015-11-04 19:50:00;20 mins;I noticed what looked to be a star like shaped object, glistening in the sky. I was walking toward downtown in my city in London, ON, Canada, and I stopped to take a brake while walking along a path at the Thames River.  As I sat down to take a break for a few moments I looked into the starlit sky.  At first I observed the usual stars.... then in an instant, I seen what looked to be a shooting star streak across the sky in a horizontal direction.  I have seen a few occurrences like this so I thought it was another amazing moment looking into the sky.  Then afterward about five minutes later I noticed what looked to be a star like shaped object, glistening in the sky just like all the others, but this star seemed to be moving around slightly.  I quickly thought to myself to grab my smartphone and record this phenomena, as I did so the sky was so black that only darkness was able to be seen from my smartphone video recording app. So I began to record the object in the sky anyhow.  Then after about ten minuets I decided to take out my other cell ! phone to take some pictures as best as I could.  This object traveled slowly in the sky then would stop for a few moments then would slowly move again. Then this star like object traveled in a circle as I watched closely in the sky as I observed sitting on the pathway bench.  Then an aircraft began to travel in the same vicinity with the regular flashing lights that people normally seen when observing aircraft's in the sky.  I continued to watch this star like object move and when someone walked along the pathway, this star shaped object stopped in place looking just like a regular star in the nights constellation.  After the person walked off the pathway out of sight, this star shaped object began to slowly move around again in slow semi circular movements.  At 20:10pm, I continued to walk to finish my errands, and I am about to go back to the pathway to observe if there's any more unknown objects in the sky.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
