Silent, black, rotating cylinder shaped object crosses the sky below clouds ceiling;2009-08-19 08:50:00;20 seconds;Silent, black, rotating cylinder shaped object crosses the sky below clouds ceiling I had left a car seat that my wife needed in my car, so I left my office on the 19th floor, headed downstairs on the elevator and outside towards the parking garage across the street to meet her. The weather that morning was mostly cloudy with some sun shining through in patches.  It was not raining and the temperature was about 20 degrees Celsius. As I was walking to the parking garage, I look up and noticed a black cylinder shaped object that was crossing the sky in front of me (between a 45 and 50 degree angle upwards in the sky, traveling in a left to right (west to east) direction.  I wouldn’t dare guess at its length but with my arm extended it would be about the width of my thumb. As I was watching it sunlight momentarily reflected off of it’s surface for about 3 or 4 seconds then stopped, at which point I noticed it was rotating in a counter clockwise manner.  It resembled a cylinder in shape that appeared to have flat surfaces down the length of it (like a stop sign).  There were no wings, no propellers, no contrails, no markings or lights, and most importantly no sound of any kind!  At this point I thought it was maybe a satellite but determined that it couldn’t be due to its low altitude.  Its trajectory was smooth (like a satellite in space) with a hint of intermittent acceleration within its forward motion it definitely appeared to have no problem maintaining its altitude and velocity (which tells me it was not a falling satellite). Sunlight reflected off it again for a moment due to its counter clockwise rotation and by this time it is now to my right at about the two o’clock position.  The reflection then stopped because this object was traveling underneath the cloud ceiling.  A few moments later it ultimately disappeared into the clouds themselves.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
The craft flew faster than anything ive ever sen and made no noise;2013-05-04 22:00:00;45 seconds;Rhe craft flew faster than anything ive ever seen and made no noise me and my fiancee were out on our patio with family and friends when i noticed a bright red sphere flying fast across the sky and i ran into my place and grabbed my phone and got back out in time to film the last 30 seconds or so of the craft .  it flew at a very high speed from the east sky to the west and in the video u can actually see it passes an airplane and speeds extremely fast it.  We all have never seen anything like that before until i seen a report on your website where a girl said she and her boyfriend were sitting outback of there house and seen what looks and sounds like the same craft we seen less than one month earlier.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
