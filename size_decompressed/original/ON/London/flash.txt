I happened to be looking out of a back window at 2:30 AM  when I saw a very bright, white light come out from behind the trees behind our house. It was so brilliantly bright that I called to my mother to come and see it too before it disappeared. It looked like a moving flash of light. The object itself was not flashing it was a constant, extremely bright, white light, which I've never seen anything like. If I had to describe it further, I would say that it reminded me of a clear Christmas tree light, laying on its side (that is, horizontally) - only a thousand times more bright. The shape of the object - other than its eliptical bias (it was NOT round) - we couldn't determine because the rays shone out from the center of the light, extending away from it, obscuring its actual shape. I can't emphasize enough what a BRIGHT, large light it was. It's difficult to estimate its distance, but it seemed to be moving at the approximate height of a helicopter a fair distance away. It remained at a constant altitude from the time I first saw it to when it crossed behind the trees out of our field of vision. It made no discernible sound. The window faces to the north and the object passed from the west to the east. For maybe 10 - 15 seconds or so it disappeared behind some trees, but it emerged again (where one would have expected it to) and continued moving to the right. The whole thing lasted approximately 45 seconds. If one would have been directly underneath it, I suspect it would have lit up the ground below, it was so bright it was like a huge, moving star against the dark clouds - we had had a thunderstorm earlier and the sky was still very dark.

bright light hovering above trees, moving in short  jerky movements, with a strange high pitched sound.;2004-09-11 03:00:00;2 hours;bright light hovering above trees, moving in short  jerky movements, with a strange high pitched sound. I saw one bright object hover above the trees far off in the distance from my bathroom window, facing north.  Tonight is very clear, and there are a few stars.  The object was stationary, though it weaved left and right in short jerky movements.  It had white and blue lights, and none were red like a passenger jet.  There was a strange high pitch sound.  I can assure you from years of observances at the night sky, I have never seen anything like it.  I was very shaken up by it.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
