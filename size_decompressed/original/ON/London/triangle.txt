mother and father encountered triangular hovering shape over hwy 28 years ago.;1973-06-30 21:00:00;unknown;mother and father encountered triangular hovering shape over hwy 28 years ago. 28 years ago my mother and father's car stalled on Hwy 401 between london and tillsonburg.  When they pulled over they both got out of the car.  I'm not sure who saw it first, but they saw a triangular shape hovering close to them it had flashing lights (white light on all tree points and a red in the middle).  A few moments later it shot out a white light in front of it and then it was gone.   They both got back in the car and drove away.  My brother and I were born shortly after the the incident and my mother told me afterwards (almost dying of a c-section) when she awoke (dream state or awake, unknown) the walls were bright white and see through.  Black shadows apeared behind the wall, they were trying to get through is what it looked like to my mother.   Than a few moments later they were gone and my father was standing in the doorway.

No sound, one light in front tip of triangle and moved extremely slowly.;1977-10-10 17:00:00;20 minutes;No sound, one light in front tip of triangle and moved extremely slowly. It was just after our Thanksgiving meal and we were all situated in the living room and I sat directly looking out the front window looking west, when I noticed a bright yellow white light in the distance and as everyone else was talking, I just focused my attention on this light that was approaching very very slowly from the west by now I started to tell everyone that this light which by now was getting brighter and brighter had everyone's attention.  We all headed out to front driveway and as we did this large black triangle almost the color of the night sky but we could all make it out flew directly over the house no sound no markings and moving almost at a crawl.  Couldn't measure the height it was flying but it seemed extremely low.  Its width was at two house properties wide maybe over a 100 feet and at least that from back to front.  It continued on in the same direction heading east till was gone from our view. I always believed it was a UFO and I'm sure there were skeptics in family before this happened but not after.  I was a teen then and that memory that night still comes up in conversation.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
The object was low to the ground, stationary and had three bright white lights in a triangular formation, with no sound.;2002-10-22 22:30:00;1-2 minutes;The object was low to the ground, stationary and had three bright white lights in a triangular formation, with no sound. I was driving home on an October evening (mid to late October). I was on Fanshaw Park Road, heading west.  I saw to the left of me, off the main road and in a sub-division known in London as Richmond Hill, a strange object. I saw a series of 3 lights in a triangular formation. I thought at the time, it was the lights from a radio tower but I never remembered seeing one there before. (I drove by this area for many years.)    What struck me as rather odd was how low this formation was and the absence of sound.  It seemed to be about 40 feet above the road (over double the height of a hydro pole).  Then I thought maybe it was a helicopter hovering over this area...but again, no sound.  Plus it was very steady, whereas a helicopter tends to hover and shift.   I remember nearly getting into a car accident because I slowed down and was trying to get a better look.  Unfortunately the traffic was too heavy for me to turn around to check it out more thoroughly.  The next day, I drove by the area and there was no radio tower...so I realized that this must have been an ufo sighting. The fact that it was low to the ground, the light was white and rather bright at the bottom of the ship caught my attention.   Also, it was dark above so I couldn't see the top of it, but I believe there were 3 lights coming from the bottom.  I think there may have been a fourth light but it was red, which is why I must have assumed it was a radio tower.   Unfortunately, I was traveling a good speed at the time so that detail was a bit hazy.  Plus it happened 2 1/2 years ago. I'm sure I wrote this down in my journal.  But I'm currently not living in Canada so I can't verify the details or the exact date.  I do remember the month because it was still warm enough to drive with the window down, which is why I found it so odd that there wasn't any sound.

The most colourful brilliant lights, moving in a circle around the object, looked like Christmas lights. ((Sirius??));2004-08-14 00:30:00;40 mins;The most colourful brilliant lights, moving in a circle around the object, looked like Christmas lights. At about 12:30am our neighbours called us on the phone and told us to come out back, they see something really weird, and to bring binoculars.  Our houses back onto a large field and its very dark so its easy to see stars and stuff. To the north west there was a small object that looked like an airplane or a star at first glance, but when we watched it, it stayed in one spot, sometimes moving from side to side quickly, but back to its same spot again.  When we looked at it through the binoulars you could clearly see red, blue and green lights moving in a circle around the object.  They looked like Christmas lights, they were so colourful and brilliant.  The object looked like a sort of triangle, big at the top and skinnier towards the bottom.  We watched for about 40 mins and then it faded off, getting farther away, then reappearing for a second and then completely gone.  It didn't go up into the sky, but just disappeared over the horizon.  I called the news to see if anyone else reported this, but all the lines were busy.  We never heard anything about it since.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
Triangular shaped object flying quite fast accross evening sky  ((NUFORC Note:  Low-flying aircraft??  PD));2004-09-10 22:00:00;Approx. 30 Sec.;Triangular shaped object flying quite fast accross evening sky I was looking out the window speaking on the telephone this evening when I heard what sounded like a plane. As I looked up out of the window to see it, I saw a triangle shaped aircraft or something? flying across my range of vision traveling in a south-easterly direction. Although it was quite fast, I have never seen an aircraft with triangular lighting? To the best of my recollection, the craft had red, blue and yellow lights on it and none were flashing. I am a bit of a UFO buff, and realize that most of these triangular shaped craft are silent but this was not??  Im not sure what to make of it but thought I should report it. Maybe someone else saw it as well?;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
Looked up to sky noticed a triangular shaped object with red lights on each point of the triangle flying from north to south like an ar;2004-09-26 05:20:00;15 seconds;Looked up to sky noticed a triangular shaped object with red lights on each point of the triangle flying from north to south like an arrow pointing as it flew. It was hard to tell how fast it was going but it passed overhead and was gone in 10 to 15 seconds. Quite faster than any plane creeping by.  The object seemed extremely large by assuming each light on it was plane sized and it covered quite a bit of sky.I tried to point it out to others around me but it happened too quickly.  I wished I had a laser pointer or some form of light to get its attention like it got mine.!;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313

So I attempted to follow it got out of the car and listened it had no sound. So we drove to a place you can see pretty much all the planes etc for miles It was gone with out a trace. It flew very steady and had 4 lights all together they were like amber one in the middle and three on the points of the triangle.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313

Not Just 3 glowing lights;2008-08-17 02:00:00;2sec;Not Just 3 glowing lights At around 02:00 to 02:15 on sunday August 17th i was have a cigarette outside,I happened to look up and saw i strangest thing i ever saw in my life . I'll tring to explain this the best way i know how. It wasn't just 3 very large glowing lights in a triangle form on it's belly side above me at about 500 to 1000 ft Traveling at great speed moving from south london to north direction and lasted not even 2 sec. It had like a wake of something coming from 2 sides.I guess because it was going so fast it look like what you would see in the movies when a bullet is going in slow motion breaking the air ,and it has a wake coming from it. It had no sound what so ever not even a hiss or whisper and no vapor trail from behind it like a plane or jet leaves behind.i waited about 10 mins after the event to see if there was anything else i was waiting to a sonic boom but nothing but i guess if i did hear one it would have deafened me at that speed and distance from me. Anyway thats about as best as i can do to describe what i saw.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
There were clearly unexplained phenomenon at this time and they were not airplanes.;2018-05-30 23:56:00;<4 minutes;There were clearly unexplained phenomenon at this time and they were not airplanes. There were 6 ufos that looked like they were playing follow the leader.  There was no direct flying course.  They were all white looking no flashing lights just stayed white.  They were clearly following the lead UFO we first spotted them to the east and they quickly went south then turned north west and headed west before we lost sight.  If I could draw them they’d look kinda like white paragliders that were moving at a phenomenal rate and flying formations that are only possible with birds.  They were turning and swapping places quickly.  There were clearly three other airplanes in the sky around the same time.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
2 people see something different experience;2020-08-09 01:30:00;20 minutes;2 people see something different experience Basically around 1:30 am observer 1 noticed a triangular craft move above north west of our seated area in our back yard. It was just below clouds . It was whispy cloud cover nit thick at all Moon was to our south east and it was about 3/4 moon It hovered went west past tree line and then came back hovered again and went east then out of sight Lasted about 20 minutes. He says it was size of quarter at arms length quote from observer 1 “ Triangular in shape its flight path was like a clothesline parallel and lights where violet green white yellow and I want to say like Amber not red not Orange” Observer two only observed the object after informed by observer 1. I noticed it above hovering north west of my position . First thought it was a drone . Because it sat in the one position with multi coloured lights blinking . The lights to me seemed to indicate a circular pattern or craft. It moved east and to me seemed to have a appearance of lights in circular pattern at each end of object . To me the object was translucent the shape like a helicopter. It made no noise of an engine but I thought I heard air moving . It went to the east and disappeared. The lights to me seemed like Christmas lights . Flashing twinkling . But I like an airplane not in a fixed patter. After I stopped watching I saw in the top of a tree in neighbours tree a bright white light blink out the size of soft ball . I thought fire fly them it occurred it was too big to be firefly .  Several weeks before observer 2 saw in same location saw a yellow orange light travel upwards seemed steep incline . I took video and picture of that . It was northern sky;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
