Flash than smoke trails.  Then unknown object moving very fast after explosion;2006-08-05 04:30:00;1:30min;Flash than smoke trails.  Then unknown object moving very fast after explosion I was with co-workers have a cigarette after work in our bar patio in downtown london.  It was around 4:30am when a huge flash of light lit up the sky and we all looked up and saw this trail of smoke probably a couple of km long.  This smoke trail was (30,000ft Plus)very high in the sky.  Then the smoke started to disappearing (the was alot of stars and it was a clear sky.)  But then a star started to move westward direction and very high speed.  On a clear day you can see those tiny jet planes very high up and moving. This star was moving at around 8 times that speed until we couldn't see it any more.  The Flash startled us and when we saw the smoke we thought it was a comet or something that burned up but that star made it feel like it was something pretty unreal.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
30-40 dim lights flying over London Ont. over hour span;2007-05-18 22:50:00;45-hour;30-40 dim lights flying over London Ont. over hour span sitting in a park with a friend...first saw 3 or 4 very dim almost translucent grey type lights (like a small spot light on the clouds but was a clear night out) going NE to N direction.  I saw them but friend didnt... 30 seconds later another set whent by with no sound traveling across the horizon in about 4 seconds. We eventually over about 20 min saw roughly 10-12 sets of these lights including one set that had about 10 lights in a V duck looking formation that change shape. There was also a set of 3 or 4 that went about 2 times faster then all the other ones..that was very scary  then they stoped for about 40 min then as we walked home we saw them 2 more times heading over the east end of the city of london Ont. My friend called her mom who lives about a 4 min drive away in the direction these lights were going...she said she saw them but with a few seconds delay.  these were NOT airplane or star looking lights..they where like dim-shadowy sillouets coming from nowhere. This is no joke...it rattled me and her and we are 100% confident it was nothing man made. It looked nothing like a plane, weather thingy,satelite or anything like that..this is scary cause they all went north from all diferent directions and they sometimes changed formation or crossed over eachother and or converged togtether...one I noticed was oscilating almost (shaking).;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
C shape with a T front over London ont on Oct 10, 2008 on a clear day around 2PM;2008-10-10 02:00:00;2 min. approx;C shape with a T front over London ont on Oct 10, 2008 on a clear day around 2PM Boomerang/C shape with the letter T in the front of it.(I am mailing a graphic of it.) I was standing at the bus stop at Highbury Ave. and Brydges Street in London Ontario, with a bus driver on the afternoon of Oct. 10, 2008, around 2:00 PM on a clear day. It looked very big and had a hum to it. It went over our heads heading east to west. The female bus driver had a pair of small binoculars and saw that there were no markings. I noticed it right away that there were no markings because it was so large. I have waited this long to  say anything because of fear of ridicule. I have to know what it was because it was an incredible sight we witnessed. It was very large and I know that the two of us could not have been the only ones that saw it. Color was grey and the speed was not very fast. We could only watch it for two minutes or less because of the houses and trees eventually got in the way of our eye sight.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
Possible military drone or UFO.;2016-12-04 12:10:00;20 minutes;Possible military drone or UFO. I was sitting on my couch watching Netflix, when something that at first appeared to be a blue balloon hovered past my window.  It was nearly motionless and I really didn't think too much about it until it rotated 45 degrees.  At that point I could clearly see that it was not a balloon and it was not like any drone that I had ever seen.  At that point it started to move away from my window in the living room (I'm on the 9th floor of a 10 storey building). I quickly grabbed my phone and snapped the first picture from my bedroom, sadly by that point it was a couple hundred feet away, but the picture still clearly shows the details. It hovered there for maybe 2 minutes or so, rotated 180 degrees then began to hover away again.  It flew over the building just down the street and increased altitude to approximately twice the height of that building.  There is stayed for another 10 minutes or so. I did not see the craft, fly off, but as I snapped a few more pictures, it was suddenly not visible to me. I've shared the first and best photo with a friend, who owns and flies a drone, and he explained he had not seen anything like it. It's either a UFO (not massive at all) or a military craft of some sort.  As close as it was to my window initially,  I can say it had not discernable noise - and I know how much noise a drone makes from experience. Like I said, I don't know what it is, but I know it's not a commercial drone.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
