The exact date might be a bit different i forget what years i worked for the company i could find out when exactly what year it was but i was working as a bat specialist and traveling out to a job on the highway late at night, in mid-summer, in a truch with a hatchback with the guy i worked for ben when to the left of the vehicle while we were listening to some books on tape i saw a yellow orb, it was moving forward in a bowling motion like pendulem back and forth. I thought i was halucinating then checked my eyes and looked again and it was still there penduluming back and forth moving forward west like we were but slower, i said to ben look a ufo a ufo a yellow ball like thing in the sky look but he refused and was the one driving and i persisted look look their is a yellow orb in the sky moving back and forth moving forward but he refused to look he didn't really think much of my opinions. I never really thought to report it for what can they do and w! e out drove it  and it wasn't able to be seen, i forsure saw for quite a few minutes this yellow orb and have fathomed my own opinion on it. I was just watching a show on ufo's and thought a real report as to how this one was moving or whatever could help since they were going through reports. I can or could take a lie detector on seeing this thing mutiple ones actually and this was the only time while traveling or ever that i saw one, and i really saw it, under just the classification a yellow orb, it was to me looking like a orb like i fathomed a being being in it but it radiated light like it wasn't a craft. It was an orb of like energy, i fathomed that a being could be in it some how super powered and uses like an energy orb to protect it in space, or possibly a supernaturally powered being that is supernaturally activated. Like seriously the powers like flying beings experince in dreams your telling me none ever became supernaturally powered since the dinosaures. My pr! icipal is that to gain the superpowers you have in your dreams! like fl ying you have to be who you are in your dreams, the same ways not thinking about food or drinking since if we talk stricly good and evil it is evil to harm or kill an innocent being and we subconciously recognise that since plants are innocent beings especially seed that get eaten that is evil to eat a baby being. But in anycase you can tell i am making my way to the truly good line of life and not harming any of the innocent plants or animals, and i feel i may have been contacted with how slow it was going for a reason, who ever they are with how much death of innocent beings there is i have an idea we will be hearing from them, they may be really holy beings that don't eat anything at all and just take water and why they appear as orbs of light is they have gone fusion like the sun with the water in them some type of special fusion from being really holy, and who knows what type of being it could be , maybe one from a group a species that became immortalized and supernatur! ally powered enough to travel space flying and some stayed behind. ANyways as for profacies i feel the days are upon us and we will be hearing more from them, there will be leaders that stand up agist evil strickly like how the baby plant is an innocent baby and it is evil to kill it and stand up for all life and posiibly become supernaturally powered. oh i forgot i did have one other contact. i was at my house and one night i saw this white light jumping from tree to tree and heard abnormal sounds coming from the woods, there are woods off the back of my house at n6c 1x3 and it made a weird eching sound and it looked at one second like a white light body of this baby human that may be wild but looked like a ball baby sized of white light and it scared me it seemed very fast and the weird sound scared me and i can take a lie detector on either of these occurances, it dissapeared and i th saw the light reappear deeper in the woods, i was scared for i know its wrong to smoke ! and i thought it might be a being like made some of the shallo! w crater s on the moon that are wide for such shallowness from fushion meditation and i was smoking and i could heard the leaves move and then their was a creak from the fence like something was bhinde it , and it had been moving between treees in front of me, and that dissapearing move i thought it might have locked on to it's reappearpoint and was going to attack me for harming the one year old plants leaves when i should be holy for the planet then it made a sound and did the dissapppearing move and i heard another sound from behind the fence  and i pretty much ran in but as far as sky ufo's that yellow orb thing was the only time but this white light being or glowing being i saw a few times. i think it might be a holy protector of the planet i think that came to contact me to help my life. i saw it a few differernt days, it was white like lightening enery. I wasn't even thinking of that i had comppletely forgot, but i was thinking it some enlightened animal and it wasn't a sky uf! o but i am not lieing and i wrote this just like this you got the second on me remembering it's been like a year or more since then so i dunno how i forgot but i was thinking of just that sky ufo i had seen anyways if this helps you then good. When i went in i was sure to lock my door at night.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
High speed lights changing direction on a dime;2006-09-02 22:00:00;10 seconds;High speed lights changing direction on a dime I was sitting in my hottub around 10pm early september when I saw two fast moving bright lights going horizontaly across the sky, which I thought were shooting stars so I thought it was neat. A few seconds later they stopped dead and then crossed paths.  At this time my mouth was wide open and I stood up very shocked because the first thing that poped into my mind was UFOs. After crossing paths the lights almost dimmed and disappeared.  These objects UFOs or not were moving a super high speeds.  If I had to compare to anything i said about 5-6 times faster then you watch an airplane go through the sky.

Reddish object from the north slowy went east and then 10 min. later it happened again.;2012-08-18 21:30:00;5-10 minutes;Reddish object from the north slowy went east and then 10 min. later it happened again. We were sitting around a fire, from the north came a reddish light. It appeared to be moving slowly.  The object was right in front of us. It had a white ring around the centre and had an orange/red glow around the ring.  It slowly moved towards the east.  We watched it go fade away.  About 10 min.later we saw it again.  It went in the same path.  The sky was very clear that night and we all saw it clearly. It was amazing!!!!!;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313

We a fourth one not to far behind and it was travelling quickly too heading west as well like it was trying to catch up to the others?   Then as we were watching it the object flew higher and higher until it disappeared into the sky.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
Flew in straight line then flew upwards from one point.;2013-05-30 04:20:00;10;Flew in straight line then flew upwards from one point. I was standing outside of my work having a smoke.  As usual I observed the night sky and to my surprise, I saw a dim white light above me.  It looked to be outside of our atmosphere, so I watched it flew in a straight line, about 1 minute after watching the object it seemed to stop and slowy fade away as if it was going straight up into space from that point while trying to stay focused on it   I noticed kind of a ring around the object and the light in the middle of the ring,   This was veiwed in london ontario at about 4:20 am until about 4:30 am may 30th 2013.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
Solid bright red light, with intermittent white flashing while hovering in a stationary location;2016-11-16 22:00:00;2 minutes;Solid bright red light, with intermittent white flashing while hovering in a stationary location We saw a bright, solid red light hovering to the South of us.  It stopped moving, and then flashed a white light (like a camera) about a dozen times.  Then the red light moved a bit West, stopped and flashed white again.  The red light was constant.  The flashing white was something extra. It was higher than I would think a civilian drone could fly.  Lower than most planes, higher than most helicopters we see. It would hover while flashing.  Then it would move South and West, then stop and flash again.  A few times it flashed the white light while moving, but most of the time it would stop – flash – then move again. The flash couldn’t be for taking pictures because it was night and the flash wouldn’t do any good that distance from the ground?  A helicopter flew past our house in the direction of the light a minute later, but there is a hospital in that direction so that may be unrelated. The thing eventually disappeared behind houses to the South of us.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
