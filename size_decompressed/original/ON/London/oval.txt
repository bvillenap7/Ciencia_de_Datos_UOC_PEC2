No markings, shaped like capsule observed for about 15 seconds About 1:30 PM in the afternoon on a bright, sunny, clear day. From my window I saw one dull metallic grey object having no markings of any kind hovering in the sky to the North West of the city. Unable to accurately describe size as I do not know how far away it was. Judging only by it's clarity I guessed it to be less than half mile distant at about one thousand feet altitude. Size at a guess about 30 feet in length and approximately 8 feet in width. It was floating horizontally, stationary at first for about 10 seconds then slowly moved South East out of my view. It was cylindrical with rounded ends, the same shape as a medicinal gelatin capsule. I am  a licensed pilot (fixed wing)and a retired police sergeant. I would estimate my observational ability as very good. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313

The object was like a blob...it was green and it just shot across the sky, like a meterite.  But it was green and very bright.  It looked like it went down behind trees.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
I saw what I thought was the space station.  ((anonymous report));2019-09-17 22:25:00;Until I went to sleep;At approximately 10:25 p.m., I was looking up in the sky as I saw a plane then from the East I saw what I thought was the space station above the plane then it stopped and literally stayed there for an hour or more till I fell asleep it was doing a little zigzag movements I confirmed it with my neighbours who came out on their porch to have a smoke so I'm not crazy I'm not a drinker -43 year old intelligent male never thought I would be reporting a UFO sighting I figured maybe you could be a drone, but living so close to the airport and that high up and after one hour I was like there is no way it's a drone I have video.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
