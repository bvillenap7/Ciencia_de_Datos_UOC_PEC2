side by side dim orange lights quickly across sky;2008-05-25 23:40:00;8 seconds;side by side dim orange lights quickly across sky Was looking into a clear and star filled night. The seen 2 fast moving lights move from above my head to the north then disappear out of sight. They had a slight orange glow to them. They were fairly small in size though. stayed close together but near the end separated in almost unity at the same speed then from what my friend and I remember moved back together then vanished. The lights took about 8 seconds to go from straight above our heads till out of site in the far distance. Way too fast for birds and too consistent to be birds also. Very spooky though. Seen similar traveling lights same time exactly one year ago just a park over so very interesting it happened again. This time they were more orange then a dim glowing white color. also last year the lights went on for about 20 minutes in different formations (some in 2's, some in V's).;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
