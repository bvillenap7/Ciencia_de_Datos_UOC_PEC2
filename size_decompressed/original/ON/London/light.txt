Small red and white light travelling in odd directions.;1995-08-23 01:30:00;2-3 minutes;Small red and white light travelling in odd directions. I wrote this down on August 25/95, but noted that it was a few nights ago so I'm guessing early in the morning of the 23rd.  I was looking out into my backyard, and a large red light, with a smaller white one (neither flashing), slowly travelled from the west to the east.  After coming into my view, it passed behind some buildings (about half a kilometer away), then seemed to be travelling north, stopping (from my point of view) behind a tree in my backyard.  It immediately reappeared from behind the tree and travelled back the way it came, repeating this 4 or 5 times.  It wasn't making any noise, and didn't seem to be moving in any way that a plane would move.  It was travelling about as fast as you'd expect a plane to travel, though.

Stationary lights in the day  sky over London Ontario.;2001-04-29 16:35:00;25 minutes;Stationary lights in the day  sky over London Ontario. At approx. 6:35 E.S.T. we were sitting outside on the patio. It was a clear blue sky, I was watching planes flying overhead. I had seen about 10 planes go over in about 15 minutes. All the planes had two contrails , then one flew over going west this plane had 4 contrails that stayed in the sky for a longer period of time than the other planes that had 2 contrails. About 10 minutes later a plane flying east had 4 contrails  as this plane past over I noticed the plane pass another object with no contrail. I watched the object with no contrail. It was stationary. At first I thought it was a parachutists. After about 30 seconds I still did not notice it moving. I pointed out the object to the other person with me. She also saw it in the sky. The object appeared to be very high up in the sky. I than thought it might be the space lab reflecting the sunlight. Than out of no where three more objects appeared to the left of the 1st sighted object. These objects formed a triangle that would hold constant shape for about two minutes. The triangle would remain a triangle but two of the objects would get closer while the third would get further away. Then their triangle would get smaller. All the while the larger object remained to the left of the triangle. I called my wife out to see this. She brought out her camera and we took a couple of pictures. I got my binoculars and tried to get a closer look. What I saw was a faint blue light going between the white lights forming the triangle. When I looked at the bigger object to the left of the white lights forming the triangle I saw another blue light in the bigger object. This lasted about 20 to 25 minutes. Than another larger plane with no contrails appeared to fly out of the eastern sky at the objects. The plane veered off the the south after getting near the spot of the objects. About 4 to 5 minutes later the objects were gone from sight. They may have past over the horizon but did not appear to.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313

Bright Ball of light . No blinking lights just a solid ball of light.;2002-08-22 21:00:00;45 minutes;Bright Ball of light . No blinking lights just a solid ball of light. I was coming home with my parents from London. As we were driving along the highway I saw a bright light in the sky. It was around 9:00 pm so it was dark. I watched this light for about 40 minutes. For about 30 minutes it just hoverd over a field. It was really bright and pretty close to the ground I'd say about 200 feet in the air. It would go from really bright to not bright. But after 30 minutes it got REALLY bright! and started moving across the sky. It wasnt going that fast and it didnt have blinking lights either. It was just a solid bright ball of light.  It kept moving towards the city untill i coudnt see it any more. I have seen this light about 5 times around that area. I have no Idea what it is. Just so you know I wasnt driving but was siting in the back seat. accually now that i think of it the light wasnt standing still it was moving about the same speed as the car . thats how i could see it for so long.

Star like, rapidly changing colours, pulsating, high speed movement, very high up ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star?? PD));2004-06-23 02:30:00;5 Minutes;Star like, rapidly changing colours, pulsating, high speed movement, very high up I was out with my on the handle of the big dipper, hoping to catch some of the so-called surprise June meteor shower.  I was well rewarded with a few streaking meteors, and several flashes.  During a lull I started looking in the west-northwest sky and an object about the size and brightness of venus (maybe not quite as bright) caught my eye.  My initial thought was wow, that's a really hyper twinkling star.  I kept my eye on it and noticing it was changing colour rapidly.  Almost pulsing you could say.  Seemed like there might be a pattern to it.  Then it suddenly stopped changing colours and stated sort of a blue-ish hue.  It suddenly zoomed over to a new location.  If you extend your arm, and hold your hand up to the sky and measure approx. 3 inches from your thumb to your pointing finger, that was the distance it moved in approx. 1 second.  It left a faint streak momentarily.  That move seemed to be straight towards the north.  Then it stopped and then moved again, same distance, but this time seemed to be going down, or possibly East.  It was hard to tell because it seems to be at a great distance.  I would not be surprised if it's not even in our atmosphere.  (hard to guess without having any idea of it's size)  This was my very first UFO sighting.  I have always had an open mind to the possibility, but without actually seeing one with my own eyes I could never totally believe it.  I wish they would just land on the white house lawn and end all the charades.  I was out again tonight and saw the exact same object, same time of night, same general area of the sky.  Except instead of doing an upside down L in the sky, it seems to sort of just zig zag, and at one point did 2 circles.  Cloud cover obscured my view after only 5 minutes of watching it tonight.  I suspect that anyone with a clear sky around 02:30 Eastern time will be able to see it.  It seems to be a regular visitor. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the possibility that the witness is observing a twinkling star would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that he was observing a UFO.

Explosion in the sky.;2006-11-14 03:10:00;15secs;explosion in the sky I posted a sighting about two months ago and a flash and smoke trail, with a ufo moving away from the smoke.  Here in London Ont.   It happened again but this time I was looking at the sky having a smoke before I went to bed and I saw a slowly moving orange light high in the sky and it blew up right before my eyes.   The flash was intense lit up everything to the point I had to look away for moment.  it happened again  I said to myself and I quickly refocused my eyes searching for a moving star and behold there was one dim star moving very fast to the northwest.   The only thing I can think of is that it was a dog fight up there and somebody lost.   I did not see anything hit the object.

2 dim lights at night, flying fast in formation, then independently in small arcs then chased each other in a small circle.;2008-03-29 22:15:00;4 to 5 seconds;2 dim lights at night, flying fast in formation, then independently in small arcs then chased each other in a small circle. Date: March 29, 2008, Saturday (the night of the Earth Hour) Time: 10:15 PM (+-5 minutes) Place: Argyle Mall parking lot (Clarke Rd. at Dundas St.), London, Ontario, Canada  Brief Description  Two dim orangish-white lights in close proximity, flying low (around 3,000 ft??) and fast, at first in formation, and then independently, in small arcs all the while remaining in proximity to each other. Before the lights disappeared in the distance, they had chased each other rapidly in a small circle. The entire performance resembled a bravado-fuelled airshow, with rapid manoeuvres and (nearly?) silent engines. The event lasted 4 or 5 seconds during which the objects traversed one-third of the sky. Although there were brief and faint sounds (a vibrating rumble and a wooshing noise) associated with the phenomenon, they may have been coincidental.  Full Description  After shopping at Wal-mart, I was walking through the Argyle Mall parking lot when a movement in the clear night sky induced me to look up. West of where I stood, some 50 degrees up in the sky, I saw two steady (non-flashing) orangish-white lights (the size of an average star, but noticeably dimmer) in proximity to each other, moving fast in formation in the southwesterly direction. I assumed this was an airliner with lights on both ends of its wings. The aircraft appeared to be flying very low, because the lights were moving very fast and the distance between them was rather large. (If I extended my arm, the length of my index finger would approximate the apparent distance between the lights. For what it's worth, I'd speculate that the altitude couldn't have been higher than 3,000 ft.)  When the lights simultaneously veered away from each other in symmetrical arcs, it became obvious that they were two separate objects that had been moving in formation. The objects then performed some playful airshow-style acrobatics (lots of rapid turns in different directions) at high speeds, all the while continuing in the southwesterly direction. Before they disappeared in the distance, the lights had performed a spectacular manoeuvre: for at least one second they were chasing each other in a small circle (perhaps 5 degrees in diameter), as if they were attached to the blades of a rotating propeller. The revolution was so rapid (at least two rotations per second) that it drew a distinct circle of light against the night sky. (It's possible that what looked like circular motions from a distance were actually coordinated corkscrew motions along the axis of the southwesterly trajectory the lights were following.) The entire experience lasted only 4 to 5 seconds, during which the objects managed to traverse at least one-third of the sky (this indicates considerable speed). Although there were other people nearby at the time, I doubt anyone else noticed this brief and low-key phenomenon.  What struck me about the quality of the motion of the objects was the speed and peculiar fluidity and smoothness with which they changed directions. The thought that came to my mind was: they behave like living creatures, not aircrafts -- the motion somehow reminded me of bats in flight or fish swimming in water. The final circular manoeuvre brought to mind mosquitoes or flies swarming around. I've never seen airplanes performing such swift and tight acrobatics.  While I detected some strange faint sounds coinciding with the sighting, I can't be sure they were emitted by the objects, as opposed to, say, cars. When I first noticed the lights, I heard a brief (one second) and low, vibrating rumble, and then, a few seconds later, as the objects were moving further away, a brief (less than two seconds), soft wooshing sound. I'm positive I heard no ordinary aircraft noises from propeller or jet engines. (The event took place after 10 PM when traffic noise in the area was at low intensity -- it shouldn't have drowned down the sound of planes flying so low.) The absence of normal aircraft sounds seems inconsistent with the most likely mundane explanation of my experience -- that the lights marked low-flying (and improperly lit) fighter jets on a night mission. Had the objects been such aircrafts, they should have produced audible and unmistakeable jet-engine drones. (I'm not aware of an acoustic stealth technology that's this effective.)  It may be relevant to note, however, that the Argyle Mall parking lot, where I had the sighting, is located only 3 km southwest from the London (Ontario) International Airport, and that, assuming they'd been following a roughly straight path even before I noticed them, the objects were coming from the general direction of the airport.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
Light in the sky with photo;2008-09-17 03:45:00;3min;Light in the sky with photo I came home from work, I work nights as a general manager at a nightclub.    It was around 3:45 to 4am but before I walked inside I lit up a cigarette and started to smoke it on my porch.  I don’t like to smoke inside my house.   I looked up and about 3 miles away I saw this orange ball of light in the sky and at first I thought it was a plane with orange headlights because my house faces the London airport about 8 miles east of my place.  When I looked at it waiting for it to fly over my house or away It didn’t, it just stood there.  Then I ran inside to get my camera and to take a picture.    I hurried because I didn’t want it to go away.  Of course my digital camera was low on batteries so I could only manage to take one shot before it shut down on me.  I was frustrated and cursing then it looked back up and it was gone.  No sound no nothing.  This is the photo.   I can’t make sense of it.  I don’t know what it is all I do know that those are stars in the background and also I don’t know what the object is on the lower right.  Let me know what you think.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
Witnessed two seperate orange/red lights above north London Ontario.;2012-09-02 21:45:00;aprox. 2 minutes;Witnessed two seperate orange/red lights above north London Ontario. My boyfriend and I were taking our neighbour's dog for a walk between 9:30 and 10 at night when we saw a reddish orange bright light in the sky.  The sky was absolutely clear and this light seemed somewhat low, travelling at a speed slightly slower than an airplane.  It was travelling on a straight path, not wavering or descending.  There was no noise coming from it (we live in a quiet suburb). It only lasted maybe a minute then it just flickered out.  We weren't sure what we just witnessed so we continued on our walk.   About five minutes later as we were rounding the bend in our crescent I noticed the same kind of light again. It was travelling in the same direction but on a slightly different flight path this time.  This light lasted a bit longer because it didn't flicker out like the last one.  We watched this light until we couldn't see it anymore.  Not sure what it was that we saw. Definitely not something floating since it had a definite flight path and had a ! steady speed.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313

White flashing stationary light west of London, Ontario.;2016-03-15 20:20:00;30 minutes;White flashing stationary light west of London Ontario I was a passenger in a car with two other people driving south on Hyde Park rd just south of Fanshawe Pk Rd west.  We travelled south observing a bright flashing light in the sky, higher than a tower.  The flashing bright white light was stationary, and continued for over 30 minutes. It did not appear to move or emit any sound.  The object did not appear to have any characteristics of an airplane or helicopter.  The driver was able to capture some video, will see if he will share it.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
