I noticed a light in the sky. It was purple and blue. It is too early in the year for auroura borealis. I looked harder and saw 2 diamond shaped white moving lights in the centre of the purple cloudish shape. They were moving in unison and seem to join together.  They went straight north across the sky very quickly and were out of my veiw within approximately a minute.  It is a very clear night with many stars visable.  No airplane could move in this way. It was a smooth but flowing movment up and down like they were dancing.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
