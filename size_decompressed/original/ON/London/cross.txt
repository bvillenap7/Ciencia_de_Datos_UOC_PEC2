Aircraft over London, On - no contrails seen;2012-01-20 13:00:00;20 seconds;Aircraft over London, On - no contrails seen First I witnessed what I thought was a pair of aircraft, one large and one smaller.  Following was a second very large aircraft escorted by 3 smaller aircraft.  I thought perhaps 2 stealth bombers and stealth fighters but not sure?   There were no contrails.  Weather was clear and sunny with only a few clouds.  Objects were flying east to west over central London,   On at a very high altitude.  Appeared white because of altitude.
