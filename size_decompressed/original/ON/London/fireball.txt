very distant slow moving fireball;2000-09-10 23:00:00;5 minutes;very distant slow moving fireball I would describe what I saw as a very far away fireball that was rising very slowly from the low southern sky. At first it looked as if it was not moving at all. Over a period of 3-4 minutes, the object had clearly moved in an upward and easterly direction (approx. at a 45 degree angle from the horizon). This object was very far away. After a couple minutes of wondering what this was, I thought that it could possibly be the space shuttle taking off. Given the vast distance from Florida to Ontario, I did not really think that it would be possible to see. But that is how I would describe it. The fireball was stationary but shaky (much like a twinkling star but with a much greater intensity). The fireball was orange for about three minutes then it flickered to orange/white for about a minute and a half. It faded out to black over about 30 seconds.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
fireball over London ONtario Canada;2009-09-03 23:30:00;3-4 min;fireball over London Ontario, Canada was standing on the front porch having a cigarette when we noticed a fireball coming from the East going to the Southwest - at first we thought it was a plane but it was on fire, it was making no noise and we could not see any other lights other then the fireball - the moon was almost full and very bright.  Once it got into the southwest part of the sky it went out but you can still see something going towards the moon then went out of sight!  It was flying pretty low;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
Reddish- Orange floating orbs in London Ontario;2012-09-02 21:00:00;5 minutes;Reddish- Orange floating orbs in London Ontario While watching a movie, my mom noticed these strange lights floating in the air outside our home. It  followed a sound similar to a firework going off. We stepped outside assuming they were indeed fireworks but what we saw was something quite strange.  Three globe like lights moved at a moderate pace over our back yard. They were not very high in the air almost as if they were balloons that someone had just released.  However, there appeared to be a flame inside of the orb and it was surrounded by a reddish - orange globe. We watched it as it travelled past our home at which point we lost sight of the 3 objects.   Shortly there after, another object appeared, flying somewhat faster and higher but in the same direction.  This time we followed it to our front yard where we continued to watch it ascend into the sky when it quickly disappeared.   While writing this note, my husband than alerted me to another light floating in the air but at a much greater distance! . The object appeared to hover over the horizon, flickering like a ball of fire but not moving.  After several minutes, it finally moved to the south slowly out of our sight line.   My husband and I are both educated with graduate degrees in the healthcare industry, my parents are retired church going individuals and my two young children in early grade school are now very concerned about what they saw.   We are not looking to draw attention to ourselves. What we saw was not scary but rather inexplicable.  We have never seen anything like this we are just very curious to know what those lights might have been.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
Red fireball seen over london ontario canada may 4th 2013;2013-05-04 22:00:00;45 seconds;red fireball seen over london ontario canada may 4th 2013 my fiancee and i were on our patio with 5 friends when i noticed a bright red round looking light flying fast across the sky from east to west.   upon seeing the craft i ran into my apartment as fast as i could and got my smartphone and filmed the last maybe 15 to 25 seconds of the craft,   It looked to be at a low altitude possibly 500 feet at about a 60 degree angle.   It looked to be the size of a large airplane . in the video u can see the craft goes at a very high speed past an airplane in the sky.   The craft made no noise and went faster than anything ive ever seen before.  it was dark but fairly clear skies that night and it was unlike anythimg else any of us had ever witnessed.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313

Boyfriend and I saw bright orange silent fireball like orbs in sky above London Ontario.;2013-08-23 22:30:00;10 minutes;Boyfriend and I saw bright orange silent fireball like orbs in sky above London Ontario. We saw them around 10:30-ish on August 23rd (had to look in my facebook for the date..I mentioned it) in the North-West sky.  My boyfriend saw 3 of them first dancing around very choreographed and puposeful and then they went into warp speed and went up and in different directions followed by another that came from from behind them.  That is when he got me because he thought I wouldn't believe him?  lol  I saw just one very bright orange silent red ball and just stayed in one spot hanging over the treeline for 2 or 3 minutes it seemed.  It started fading to a lighter orange and got elongated.  I could see auras of light barely visible shooting of from it towards the North East and then eventually it just faded out.  I almost felt like it was staring at us..lol ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
3 distinct sets of orange orbs floating slowly on same path across NE sky.;2015-08-03 22:30:00;45 minutes;3 distinct sets of orange orbs floating slowly on same path across NE sky. We were outside on patio at about 10:30 or 11:00ish.  It was a cloudy night in the Northern sky.   I noticed an orange light traveling slowly NE.  I asked my bf if he thought that was one of those orange orbs like we had seen before in that same stretch of sky back on August 22, 2015.  This event had 3 distinct groups with different patterns.  He thought it was a plane with landing lights going to the airport, since it was going in that direction.   About what seemed like 5 minutes later another came and it continued on the exact same path and spaced the same at least 5 possibly more times.  He insisted they were airplanes and I was like no way.   Then along came a formation which had 4 orbs and looked like a triangle with a tail (I have video).  It slowly floated across the sky going the same speed and following the exact path of the ones prior.   The 3rd set came not long after the formation cleared and these came one right after another and there were at le! ast 10 of those.  Again, they followed the same path but seemed to go faster but that might just be because they were one right after another.  Regrettably, I did not capture those on video.  Since they were behind heavy clouds, they were not sharp clear circles except for one that passed by later which was so bright I literally had to squint until it too went behind cloud.   When the formation came then it was obvious to me that those were not airplanes but my bf still insisted they were until he saw the video the next day. Again, I feel sick I didn't get the last set on video.   I hope I see them again some day!  Like I said, we saw them on August 22, 2013, at around 10:30ish.  My bf said there were 3-4 stationary in the sky and they started interacting almost playfully. He said, they would shoot off in different directions and seem to fade and reappear too.   He called me out so I wouldn't think he was crazy and I just saw one that night.  It was just sitting there in one spot for at least 5 minutes.  It was very round and bright orange. It then appeared to elongate and looked like a flame and got lighter orange. It seemed to have a white light pulsing from the right side.   Eventually it jusy faded and disappeared.;42.9865618404908;-81.2493537423313
