Then I noticed that it was flashing red light.  I knew that it was not a satellite.  I thought that perhaps it might be a jet, but have never seen one up so high, but the movement of the craft was somewhat erratic and very fast.  It then made a sudden sharp turn and proceeded directly south.  I have never seen aircraft do that. It would slow down a few time and appeared to almost move around some stars.  As it was moving south I glanced back to where I originally saw it and seen 3 more craft.  They were not flashing red light.  They were white light and they moved much slower than the first.  They also made the south turn and were flying in almost a triangular pattern.  They stopped and circled what I believe to be a satellite before moving on southern direction.  That is bout all I can tell you.  Thought it might be worth mentioning.  Similar craft was seen last summer, but not reported as well as what I believe to be a fireball.;49.7824;-92.7506
