2 ufo's over Dryden,Ont,late 70's;1978-06-01 22:30:00;2-4 min;2 ufo's over Dryden,Ont,late 70's My memory's a bit foggy,happened quite awhile ago, 20+ years ago!  I was about 10, playin tag at night on the outskirts of town with about 5-6 other kids.  Someone yelledHey look or somthing and there it was, as big as the moon.  One of the kids whose place we were at called his parents attention, at first just the Mother come out and looked, then she yelled for her husband to come and look.  I still remember one of them going back inside and grabbing binoculars or a camera (binocs I'm sure) and standing on the porch looking at it.  From what I recall,the first one went in an arc (they both did) and disappeared behind the horizon of trees,the second one followed the same path except it (or the first one) stopped in the middle of it's arch and shone down a beam of light n followed same path.  Sorry ran outta room for whole story ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One can type to any length in the Description box of the NUFORC report form.  PD));49.7824;-92.7506
