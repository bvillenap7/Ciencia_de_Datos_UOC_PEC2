I was out late in the evening walking my dog (lab/border c)and tryed to see the august metor shower. I could see some stars but their was some cloud present. Spring Valley is just a stream that comes out of a side of a hill and has carved out a little valley. It then became very quite, it felt as if the air pressure had changed, and the air curent was coming from above. The dog became aroused and when the air curent was coming from above the dog saught out low wood areas and tryed to keep me moving. When I looked above the sky was black and felt and very very heavy, the air curent became stonger and warmer.The presure made my ears pop, I had great difficuly walking . I fell a lot and seemed to feel heavyer then I am. We moved along the stream down hill to the end of the park, are way out. my dog seemed to be makeing a sound like when he is distressed and ran off. As I left the park I looked up and could see a faint outline of a very large object floating above the valley. From that angle I could see what looked like large wide V's ,the odur in the air was different, I felt physically exhausted, it had felt as if I had the air sucked out of me. I have a surgical pin in my ankle joint from a past bike accident and that felt as if it were burning. I do not know what this was about. I had to get a new whatch and new cards with that black stip on them.;43.1936448979592;-79.9793897959184
