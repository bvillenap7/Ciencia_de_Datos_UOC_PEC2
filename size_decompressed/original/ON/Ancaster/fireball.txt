I was  sitting on my back yard having a coffee when I noticed an orange fireball going from the south west  to the north east.  The sky was clear with no overcast.  There was absolutely no sound.  I called my wife to come outside to have a look at it.  She thought it had a white halo around the orange flame.  By the time I got  binoculars (7x35) it had gained in altitude and accelerated in speed.  I only got a quick  look and through the binoculars there seemed to be a white haze around the object.;43.1936448979592;-79.9793897959184
