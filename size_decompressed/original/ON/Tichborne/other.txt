The other evening, after I purchased a Telescope (Bushnell Voyager) for the boys, I was sighting it in on Venus -- Low to the east at about 9:30 -- and while looking over the telescope I noticed 3, what looked to be stars, moving in unison at a extremely high altitude. In the foreground was a jet airliner making its way in the same direction (NE) of the 3 stars which were much higher and moving much slower than the aircraft. Venus remained stationary as a point of reference. I said to the boys: Look at those 3 stars moving up there. They looked and said they saw them, then they faded away. They formed a triangle pattern. It would be my guess that there was about 10 miles between the 3 points. Any ways, I actually saw something which I have no prosaic explanation for. ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  We believe the report is consistent with the three satellites that are being reported to us, currently, from many points across the country.  We believe the satellites are part of the U. S. Navy N.O.S.S. satellite program.  PD));44.6622;-76.6718
