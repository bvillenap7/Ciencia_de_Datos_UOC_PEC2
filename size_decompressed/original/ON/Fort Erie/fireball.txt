Almost twinkling in the sky.  20 mins before sunrise. A bright green flashing, sometimes steady, light in the north.  Fire and power companies responded. Lasted about 5 to 10 minutes.  First seen around 6:00am disappeared quickly. Fireball? UFO?   One things for sure it was an optical phenomena.   Took image and video before and after on snap chat unfortunately.   Someone in the area may possibly have photos;42.9;-78.9435
