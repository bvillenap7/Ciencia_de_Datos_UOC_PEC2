2 Fireballs appears in sky!;2013-05-20 21:45:00;2 minutes;2 Fireballs appears in sky! We were getting bags out of our car and saw a bright light across the street in the sky.  Upon first look it was perceived as a Chinese lantern, but was quickly distinguished as being something else.  It was a large fireball looking object.  It travelled fairly slow, not in a straight line, and no sound was present.  We saw another light appear from behind a tree and travelling almost in the same direction.  Again no sound.  The object almost appeared to flicker.   They eventually just vanished.   Video was taken of these objects and is nearly identical to videos of other fireballs that have been witnessed.;42.888;-82.4484
