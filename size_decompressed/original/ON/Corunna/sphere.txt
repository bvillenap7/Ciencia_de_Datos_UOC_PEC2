3 crimson red spheres of beauty ..;2013-08-17 22:20:00;5 minutes;3 crimson red spheres of beauty .. I was standing outside on my front porch.  It was a perfect night to see the stars. I was went outside to have a cigarette.  All of a sudden a huge red sphere with a orange outside came from directly out of the north in a straight line.  It looked like it came from above Lake Huron.  Anyways it was the most beautiful red I have ever seen!! It flew in a straight line from North to south.  It then make a 90 degree turn and headed east in a straight line.  It then made another 90 degree turn straight upward and went straight up and went right out of site.  It climbed right up and out of site.  Now behind it were 2 others which did the same thing and were the same size.  It was absolutely breathtaking!!;42.888;-82.4484
