Unknown flying object emits diamond shaped trail behind it.;2015-11-07 15:00:00;1 minute;Unknown flying object emits diamond shaped trail behind it. I was sitting in the passenger seat while my sister was driving and it was bright daylight. And she said 'Look at that' so I looked. What I seen was, I couldn't really understand what I seen because it looked like a aircraft that was emitting two chem trails.  Instead of the two chem trails forming a straight line behind the aircraft, they formed a diamond shape with an open space between the white lines.  It was hard to see what exactly what exactly was emitting that diamond shaped trail which was moving downwards at an almost imperceptible rate. As we were turning on a curve, we tried to keep our eyes on it and only removed our eyes for a split second to watch the road and when we turned back to where the thing was, it was absolutely gone.;42.5921;-82.387
