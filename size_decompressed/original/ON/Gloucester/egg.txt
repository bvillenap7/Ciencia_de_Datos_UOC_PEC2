In the late 1970’s around dinner time, I walked outside my apartment building with my dog and my friend and looked half way up the building (approx.. 7 floors) in the corner of the building (approx.  300 feet from me) and saw a football shaped grey object that was huge, no wings, no windows and multi-colored lights where the wings would normally be.  The object did not move and my friend was scared and ran away.  I stayed and watched until it just vanished (approx.. 10 minutes later).  I called the Ottawa airport and reported it to the air traffic control tower but they didn’t see anything in the sky.  Weird occurrence…  I checked in the distance and there was a plane but it was way too far away to create what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
