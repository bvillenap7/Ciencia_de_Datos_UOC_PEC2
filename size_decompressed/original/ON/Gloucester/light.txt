Two UFO's sighted with their lights above Ottawa.;2010-06-13 20:00:00;10 minutes;Two UFO's sighted with their lights above Ottawa. So I was walking outside when I looked up in the sky to see 2 pairs of lights.  They were immobile when I saw them, and they didn't have beacons, which means they were not helicopters or airplanes.  Then they started to move slowly in opposite directions, I tried to follow both but I ended up following one of them and kept following it until it was out of view.   It made no sound what so ever and it was just hovering above the city.  I couldn't see the shape of it though.
