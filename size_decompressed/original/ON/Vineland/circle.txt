Tiny stars.;2012-10-13 22:54:00;40 minutes;tiny stars tiniest star size..dark sky with clouds, only saw them in the breaks in the clouds observed small red,orange, yellow.  Two objects in two different areas, slowly moved to a very horizontle plane in my vantage view. They then moved very slowly towards each other untill they touched, then instantly they became one and shot off on a 45 degree angle to the left, leaving a white trail. It was hard to count the number because they would appear then dissappear. maybe 5 to 10 visable at one time.  When I looked at the web site, I saw a pic someone had taken of multiple ufo's! I have very similer photos I took that night.  I will send them if you want. One looks like a mother ship with sausers coming out the back.  Oh,I saw the same a few nights later, but still looking i haven't seen them again.  All the photos I took are fasinating to me. One in paticular had two orbs with trails,doing right angle turns. When I first looked at the pic I thought I may have moved the camera, but on closer inspection the trails come from different directions,  Go figure.;43.1503;-79.4
