The light then started moving in many different directions at very high rates of speeds and  at times remaining stationary before moving again. It then left from the horizon toward us at a high rate of speed covering half the sky in about Â½  a second at which time it vanished directly above us in a blurr. The color went for white to bright orange and then a dark orange then red as it accelerated towards us. I then phoned my parents that live close and asked them to look at the lights. I went back out to scanned the sky and spotted  2 bright white lights travelling to and fro changing directions instantaneously, at times they travelled together other times appearing to change positions with each other in a lose formation as they travelled across the sky.They disappeared for about 10 seconds then reappeared this time there was a total of 4 the color of the 4 was light orange. The four then flew away into the horizon, as they travelled together they appeared to change the shape of the formation every few seconds. I went inside the house and received a phone call, my parents said that what they thought was a stationary white star all of a sudden flew away changing colours. The activity stopped after the white star left.;43.8303999999999;-79.5040000000002
