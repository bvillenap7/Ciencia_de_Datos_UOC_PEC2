I was with my son's two male friends . We were all waiting for my son and girlfriend to finished their last ride. Park closes at 10:00pm  The time was about 9:55pm  I looked up to the southwest and witnessed this truly bizarre  ' thing ' in the sky. From behind me and overhead heading southwest over the township of Vaughan,Ontario. Somewhere from 5- 10 thousand feet in altitude. Clear sky - hot evening  This brilliant white cigar shaped object -jump across the sky. Just like a tic jumping - point to point in vast distance  It covered in only 5- 7 seconds as witnessed  At least the distance of somewhere between 5- 10 miles across. This brilliant white torpedo shape craft. Had rotating green and red lights underneath the front and back. Not in the mid section or body. After it had passed by and instantly pointed out to the two young witnesses. One asked &quot was that a blimp we just saw &quot. I said no - it was a UFO. He then said I'm getting afraid !  The other witness said &quot I'm getting excited &quot !  After about three minutes after the event. My son and girlfriend came out from the ride. I asked both of them if they saw a strange white object in the sky. My son did not see it. Though his girlfriend asked him while on the ride. Hey what's that a blimp !  Three witnesses besides myself. Had indeed witnessed some type of futuristic shuttle craft. To witness the speed and behaviour of the movement - incredible  Totally non - human in nature.;43.8303999999999;-79.5040000000002
