It was flashing really fast and what looked like in was moving from side to side in strait fast lines. It was going East in the same direction as I was then it moved through the sky in what looked like hopping motions and after about ten seconds in disapeard. The sky was pretty clear and it did not look like anything a have ever seen in the sky before, it was flashing too fast for it to be plane lights or anything else.;43.8303999999999;-79.5040000000002
