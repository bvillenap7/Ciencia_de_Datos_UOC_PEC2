PD));2010-08-16 00:25:00;quarter to ten to now;Ufo sighted due far west.. we went to a friends and were talking, then we seen this light.  It faded in and out multiple times, then at 0:00 it stayed bright but is slowly rising upwards, we looked at it through a scope off of a gun and seen that it had yellow, red, green, blue the main object is circular/ovalish, with spikes around it circling it, we witnessed it earlier around 10:45Pm and we kept watching it rise upwards.  its just looks like a main ship or a mother-ship of some sort.  There's other smaller ship's around it we couldn't see them very well its looks like a crystal shape, our camera's are not quite strong enough to see it or take a picture of it, everytime we look at it it moves upwards or moves to the left more and more.   We think it could be collecting any hydro waves from our hydro station.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of Jupiter in the eastern sky, but witness does not indicate direction he is looking.
