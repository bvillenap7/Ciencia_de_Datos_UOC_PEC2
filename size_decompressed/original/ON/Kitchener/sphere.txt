A small circular craft with rotating lights around its center;1977-07-01 02:00:00;2 minutes;A small circular craft with rotating lights around its center When I was just 4 years old I witnessed an incredible UFO.  After everyone in my family was asleep, I woke up and got out of bed, left our first floor apartment, through the front door, and entered my neighbors apartment, across the hall.  Their door was unlocked, as was normal in the seventies.  I walked over to their balcony door, opened it and stood there for a moment, just staring outside.  There was an empty lot between the apartment I was in and the next row of homes, which spanned approximately 100 meters.  It wasn't long before the UFO appeared over the lot, traveling  perpendicularly to my position, just above the rooftops, at about 10 kilometers per hour.  It stopped directly across from me for about 1 minute and then resumed its movement, until I was unable to see it an longer.  It had soft,  multicolored lights rotating around it's center, blinking in unison. I believe it was metallic and about the size of a car.  I do not remember hearing anything stra! nge or out of the ordinary while watching the UFO.  After it left, I closed the balcony door, and returned to my apartment, without waking my parents.  I can still remember the experience vividly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));43.4326975791433;-80.4784508379888
Bright white ball of light seen over Kitchener Ontario.;2008-06-16 00:58:00;1 second;Bright white ball of light seen over Kitchener Ontario. I was on my computer, in front of an open window which faces Northeast. The object appeared towards the eastern part of the sky 20 or so degrees above the horizon. It was what appeared to be a bright white ball of light roughly the size of the moon with dim edges, although there was some light cloud cover which may have caused this effect, since it appeared to be behind the clouds. It moved extremely fast across the sky in a roughly 10 degree arc moving in a straight line from east to west before disappearing as suddenly as it appeared. It left no streaks like a meteor would, and made no sound.;43.4326975791433;-80.4784508379888
Six orange/yellow spheres observed over the Chicopee Area of Kitchener;2012-09-08 22:00:00;30 minutes;Six orange/yellow spheres observed over the Chicopee Area of Kitchener Six glowing orange and yellow orbs were observed hovering over Chicopee Ski Hill by my 22 year old son.  When he arrived at home shortly after my son, husband and myself went to the back yard to investigate.  Shortly we saw one sphere slowly fly over from the ski hill in a west to easterly direction.  For the next 10 minutes we watched another 5 orbs fly in the same direction, however no two followed the same flight path.  There was no noise from them, however we also observed 3 planes fly overhead, with their accompanying noise, but they flew at a much higher altitude then these mysterious bright spheres, and much faster.  These orbs seemed to just glide across the night sky.;43.4326975791433;-80.4784508379888
Kitchener, ON: 4 Black Orbs w/ Orange Lights Hovering, Interacting, Moving as a unit, no sound, flew straight up;2013-06-15 19:20:00;5-10 minutes;Kitchener, ON: 4 Black Orbs w/ Orange Lights Hovering, Interacting, Moving as a unit, no sound, flew straight up At approximately 9:20 PM, two unusual orange lighted-orbs were spotted from a southeast facing fourth floor balcony on Heritage Street in Kitchener, Ontario. The objects were moving northward, directly towards my building from the south-southeast, one slightly in front of the other, very close to each other.  The orbs slowed, and began hovering slowly towards each other, almost so close that their lights touched. It was at this time that two other orbs, the same shape, size and colour, were spotted heading towards the two original orbs.  The first two orbs turned off their orange lights, and it was at this time my partner and I clearly saw their spherical shape and black colouring. All four orbs hovered together in a unit, moving at times slightly closer to one another, but staying in the same general area.  My partner and I guessed the orbs to be no more than 3-400 metres above us, and maybe 1k away.  The newer arrivals also then turned off their lights after a! few moments. (At least, it looked like the lights turned off - perhaps the light was swallowed by the cloud coverage?).  After a few more moments, the orbs, as a unit, flew straight up into the clouds and disappeared from view.  At no time did we hear them making any noise, and no matter how they moved, we did not see any other shape other than a sphere (no side profile of a helicopter or other plane-like shape).   A report of the event was phoned in to the Waterloo Regional Airport (located very close to the four orbs) but the response was that the airport had not noticed anything unusual.  Drones? Advanced technology test flights?;43.4326975791433;-80.4784508379888
