Approx. 15-25 minutes after loosing sight of the craft i observed a single military aircraft going in the same direction at a similar altitude (maby 500 ft.) at a very high rate of speed on what I can only assume was an intercept course.;43.4326975791433;-80.4784508379888
Large black triangle objects with globe shaped lights moving through the sky extreamly fast with no sound.;2003-04-24 22:05:00;2 minutes;Large black triangle objects with globe shaped lights moving through the sky extreamly fast with no sound. We saw a flying black triangle with three lights on each point at approximatly 10.05 pm.  It was moving about as fast as a falling star and made no sound even though it seemed to be as large or larger than a 747 airplane.  Then twenty minutes later we saw what we thought was the same object, but this time there were four lights.  The fourth light was located in the middle of the two rear lights and this fourth light moved out past the rear light on the left side of the object and then back to the middle of the two rear lights.  The second object seemed to be going a little slower than the first one as we were able to view it a little longer.  The lights were shaped like a globe and where not real bright as they did not light up the ground below. Both objects seen where moving in the same general direction from east to west. The sky was clear that night as we were looking up at the stars when we spotted the objects.;43.4326975791433;-80.4784508379888

I woke up and sat to feed my baby and when I look at my window I saw a very big bright light that looks like a star. I noticed it because it was too big and to near to be a star. The UFO was hovering in a stationary position above a school field, when suddenly the bright light changed to sequential lights and started to move slowly towards my building. It seems like it knew that someone has seen them. Maybe because of my baby’s cry. It didn’t gave any noise and as it move above the bldg. I saw the shape as triangular and there was a red light at the one end of the craft.   managed to take a photo using my handphone but the photo showed only a small white spot on a black background. I was in a hurry to take the photo and forgot to use the zoom lens in my handphone.;43.4326975791433;-80.4784508379888
