3 silver oval crafts seen by 4 witnesses;2004-09-04 19:55:00;2 minutes;3 silver oval crafts seen by 4 witnesses 2 adults and 2 children(ages 9/10yrs). We were driving along a busy road and I spotted a silver oval craft. We pulled over and watched it disapear, then we saw the second one to the right of the car going the same way as the first....Then when the second craft disapeared we saw a third comming from the right side of the car again just above us(but a little forward as we could see them through the windshield)and it also went in the same direction as the previous two, then disapeared as wellâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found her to be seemingly quite objective in her description of the event.  We suspect she and the other parties are reliable witnesses.  PD));43.4326975791433;-80.4784508379888
No sound no lights.  ((anonymous report));2019-06-11 15:00:00;1-2 seconds;No sound no lights. The object was approximately 3 ft. long.  Black and blue with a bit of yellow.  It flew just over tree top level doing about 40 or 50 kph.   At first I thought it was a party balloon but there was no wobble and seemed to go at a steady rate.  The wind was out of the north west but that was the direction it was heading.  Against the wind.  Made no sound whatsoever. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.4326975791433;-80.4784508379888
