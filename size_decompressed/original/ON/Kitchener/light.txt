Strange lights at first thought to be shooting stars.;2007-07-29 03:00:00;Hours;Strange lights at first thought to be shooting stars. A few nights ago I awoke from a particularly bad case of sleep paralysis around 3am when I heard the sound of several neighborhood dogs barking, something was obviously disturbing them. This lead me to look out my bedroom window to investigate. I then saw what at first appeared to be shooting stars in the sky. While I was wondering why there were so many of them or why they were so frequent, i then realized they were not shooting stars at all. These objects would fly one direction, then suddenly turn in another. Some would hover still for a few seconds. Every now and then I'd see one flash then shoot off in a direction at incredible speed. I must point out that these objects did seem to be flying rather randomly. In fact, I later joked to my girlfriend if they were aliens, well they were obviously driving drunk. The lights do however seem to occasionally interact with one another, flying near to each other, hovering then flying away. These lights were visible outside my window until I fell asleep at 6am. For the most part I heard no sound connected with the objects, although I did often hear the sound of helicopters - far more frequently then i would normally in my area. I saw a helicopter only once, it did match the description of black helicopters that I have read. Being somewhat of a skeptic, as well as being aware of the effects of sleep paralysis - I at first put off these lights to being hypnagognic hallucination. This explanation, however was proven wrong when tonight I saw the same thing, also shortly after 3am. This time my sighting was not following sleep and my girlfriend was over and saw them too. Also, tonight at one point I saw a much larger and much brighter light. This light suddenly appeared in the sky, and then moved slowly to the left. I called in my girlfriend who saw it and became rather frightened. I turned to comfort her and upon me turning back, it was gone. These lights are visible outside my window now. I am aware many times alien abductions have been explained away as sleep paralysis. The fact that I had sleep paralysis before my first time witnessing these lights has me wondering if the two are in fact connected somehow. This is why I am checking the possible UFO abduction case box below. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));43.4326975791433;-80.4784508379888
Strange blue lights over Kitchener.;2012-05-18 03:34:00;60 seconds;Strange blue lights over Kitchener. I was out in my back yard having a cigarette, staring up at the stars as I usually do when I'm smoking at night.  Then I saw a dim, blue light to the west about 45 degrees above the horizon. It looked and moved like a plane at first, but then it flared up in brightness, then faded out and disappeared. Then just behind where this light first appeared, a similar light appeared and did the same thing. It began looking and moving like a plane just as the first light did, flared up in brightness, then faded out and disappeared.  Then behind where that one appeared, another. identical light appeared and did the same thing as the previous two. After this, there were two more lights which did the exact same things as the previous lights, each time appearing slightly behind where each subsequent light appeared. I thought they may have been satellites, though it was unlikely, given the fact that there were so many of them.  But I checked the simple satellite tracker anyw! ay, and saw that there were none scheduled to pass overhead at that time.  The lights made no noises like you would expect a plane to. So I'm really at a loss as to what these lights might have been.;43.4326975791433;-80.4784508379888
Two bright lights spotted near the Big Dipper, fading from sight as the moved together.  ((anonymous report));2017-03-04 15:30:00;30-60 seconds;Two bright lights spotted near the Big Dipper, fading from sight as the moved together. Observed 2 bright lights near the base of the Big Dipper's cup and handle.  The lights stayed the exact same distance from each other,  (about an inch, relatively), as they slowly moved down in the sky, along the handle of the Big Dipper towards the horizon.  They became increasingly distant and dimmer as they moved until they disappeared completely from sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Multiple lit orbs.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-09-25 21:45:00;15+ minutes;Multiple lit orbs. At 21:45 I witnessed approximately 30 light orbs travelling in a horizontal fashion . Orbs moved from left to right, never changed elevation, or descended.    Orbs were seen in clusters of 3, 2, and singles.  Orbs were positioned vertically above one another, when more than one. Orbs had no sound, only a golden white light, and sometimes red. Orbs did not pulsate, and they moved at a constant slow rate, scrolling right to left.....from my viewpoint. Orbs just seemed to disappear after reaching a certain point. Orbs seemed to be a few hundred feet off the ground, very visible by the naked eye.;43.4326975791433;-80.4784508379888
