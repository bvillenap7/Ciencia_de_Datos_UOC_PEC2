Bright orange fire-like ball.;2011-05-22 21:30:00;30 mins;Bright orange fire-like ball Several times we saw an exteremely bright orange light in the sky over kitchener.  It looked like a fire ball.  The light would travel at very high speeds, then suddenly disappear.  Would re-apear 5 minutes later in the exact same flight path it took before and go a bit farther and disappear again.  This happened 3 x, then never saw the light again.  It was silent, and no where on it were there any flashing light to indicate that it was a plane or helicopter.;43.4326975791433;-80.4784508379888
Light over Kitchener Ontario July 18 midnight;2012-07-18 00:00:00;0:03;Light over Kitchener Ontario July 18 midnight i was watching a movie at a friends apartment when I noticed a ball of fire streak across the sky for no more then 3 seconds before disappearing.  I thought some plane was on fire at first cause it just looked like a flash of yellowy /orange light that streaked across the sky.  I yelled at my buddy to look but it had already vanished.   Now im not saying it couldn't have been a shooting star or something like that, but it seem really low for something like that. it also scared the crap out of me cause I thought a plane was going to crash seeing it was so low like that...
