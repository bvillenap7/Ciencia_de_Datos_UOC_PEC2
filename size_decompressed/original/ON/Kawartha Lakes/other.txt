Hexagon Shaped Object.;2013-10-09 19:47:00;1 minute;I was out fishing on Four Mile Lake when I noticed a bright light moving slowly across the sky.  I could tell it was not a plane due to the lack of any flashing lights. I watched it for a few seconds and then scrambled for my camera to take a picture. As you can see it is clearly a hexagon shaped object.  There is a video on you-tube that looks quite similar.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urAXli185xY;44.5834;-78.8329

I'll be honest I'm not 100% what we seen.  I've heard lots of opinions thus far.  The only thing I cannot explain is what it is, and what caused it to move in such an un-uniform motion or pattern, as it seemed to be under power at first before I was able to retrieve my cellular phone to record.   This happened a few miles away from Peterborough Airport. https://youtu.be/IwiZ4LY8OrI;44.5834;-78.8329
