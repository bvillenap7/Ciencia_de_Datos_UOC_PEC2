Orb over napanee ontario canada;2011-12-20 14:27:00;45 sec;orb over napanee ontario canada Just driving west on hwy 401 5 min east of napanee.  Two jet streams in sky one old and one being created by a jet liner headed NE.  A second craft very close to the jet liner was just slighty moving SW with no jet stream.  Then the second craft slightly changed direction to west with a speed double of that of the comercial jet liner.  Then slowed to original speed and faded away in a single spot.  It should be noted that both craft were of the same size and sunny day.;44.2590270270271;-76.9379486486486
