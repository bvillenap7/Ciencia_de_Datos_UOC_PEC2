Fireball over Lake Ontario.;2013-10-19 23:30:00;45 minutes;Fireball over Lake Ontario My wife and I were travelling home to napanee from kingston,when we saw a very bright fireball hovering over Lake Ontario south west of napanee. The object appeared to be burning, as it lit the clouds bright orange surrounding it. Curiously, we began to head towards the fireball.  After approximately 40 minutes we arrived at the lake where we could see the burning orb hovering off in the westward distance a few hundred meters above the horizon. It then dimmed to a faint light, then flashed bright orange and disappeared.;44.2590270270271;-76.9379486486486
