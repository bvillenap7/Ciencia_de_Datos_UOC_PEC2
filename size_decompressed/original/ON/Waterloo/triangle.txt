Three light objects that disapeared;2005-02-17 23:20:00;10 seconds;Three light objects that disapeared I was driving home at 11:20pm and saw three very bright lights in the sky - definately not stars. I kept driving and looking when, all of the sudden, one of the bright lights started to get smaller and smaller. The other two remained very bright for about 5 seconds after, then did the same thing. Each light was fairly spread apart and high up so it was definately not an airplane.  I have no idea what this was but I'm online now just saying what I saw, which was something I have never seen and that made my heart sink because it was so crazy.;43.4781836653387;-80.5436011952192
