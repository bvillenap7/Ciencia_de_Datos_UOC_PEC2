Three distinctive illuminated lines hover above in the sky and quickly disappear towards the horizon.;1995-07-20 00:30:00;10 seconds;Three distinctive illuminated lines hover above in the sky and quickly disappear towards the horizon. My friend and I were star-gazing on the roof of the apartment, at around 12:30am, we both realized some strange lights appeared near the top of the sky.  There were three (3) orange color thin lines of different lengths... as illustrated -- ----    direction of movement UP  ^ ------ The size of the object is about 5 deg and propagate from east to west. The object moved in the direction at a right angle to the lines.  It moved very quickly from the top of the sky and disappeared into the horizon in about 10 seconds.  As the object moved away, we realized the size of the object diminishes as well.  We could not hear any sound at all.;43.4781836653387;-80.5436011952192
Out-Of-Focus Ball of White Light Flies Across Sky In Southern Ontario, Canada;2001-08-08 22:58:00;5 to 7 seconds;Out-Of-Focus Ball of White Light Flies Across Sky In Southern Ontario, Canada I was wondering if you've been receiving any reports of lights flying across the sky recently in southern Ontario,  Canada.  I live in Waterloo, about 1 hour west of Toronto, and on  Wednesday, Aug. 8th, shortly before 11PM I was outside waiting for the dog to do her business.  While waiting, I just so happened to look up northwest (at an angle of 45-50 degrees), and saw what appeared to be a slightly out-of-focus ball of white light flying across the sky at a tremendous speed.  It was about the size of my baby finger-nail held at arm's length. It's altitude must have been quite high, since there was absolutely no noise whatsoever, but it went from nearly the western horizon to the eastern horizon in a matter of 5 or 7 seconds.  I would have passed it off as a shooting star or small meteor, but the strange thing is that there was no tail, and it did not fly in a perfectly straightward path. It seemed to meander slightly as it shot from west to east, like an bee flying from one flower to another.  Have you heard of anything else like this?  Thank you.  Sincerely,  ((name deleted));43.4781836653387;-80.5436011952192
Shape becomes 2 lights flying in an erratic pathway while doing semi circles.;2008-04-06 00:30:00;5-10 seconds;Shape becomes 2 lights flying in an erratic pathway while doing semi circles. It was a clear night all the stars were visible. The area was near 2 university campuses. All I saw were the lights, my girlfriend saw a shape before it became two lights. I saw the 2 strobes of white light move in an erratic pathway high in the sky.  The 2 lights looked similar to stars and did not move in a straight line. Going generally from east to west they moved in bursts of high speed. There were erratic directional changes in their path. While covering this path the two objects also moved in relation to eachother. They repeated a path of semi circles. The lights started out larger  and brighter at the start of their path, by the end they were too far in the distance to see. It was still high above the horizon as it faded away. By the end of it's path it was not covering as much area, pretty much still as it dissapeared. It's flight was similar to that of an airplane covering the whole sky. But it flew in bursts of much higher speeds and erratic angles. What my girlfriend saw was more vivid. I had her explain in detail to me what she saw but she would not be interested in admitting  her account to anyone else. Over my shoulder she saw a sillouhette directly above her. She described this as what she thought was a bat or two blobs. She asked me what is that?  and by the time she had me looking it became the two lights and was in the oposite direction she originally had me look . We are both in our early 20's and skeptical.  I know this was not a conventional aircraft or  a shooting star due to the velocity, erratic path, and pattern or formation.;43.4781836653387;-80.5436011952192
Very bright white star-like light, at first stationary, then moved southward and disappeared over Waterloo Ontario.;2012-06-20 23:10:00;1.5 min;Very bright white star-like light, at first stationary, then moved southward and disappeared over Waterloo Ontario. The night was a fairly calm and very ckear night.  I was outside in my back patio with my son who is in excellent health and 18 yrs of age.  I am 56 yrs of age and slightly near sighted.  I noticed a very bright star at the base of the big dipper and was trying to place it in the sky from my novice astronomy knowledge.  At first is was stationary like a star then began to move southward. Just as I said there should be nothing there it began to move over head to the south. I said to my son we should hear engine signature soon but none was heard.  He commented that there are no navigation lights on it and I said that's impossible.  I thought an aircraft was on apprach with landing lights but it was not headed east to Toronto or to WaterlooWellington Airports but to Hamilton which is at least 100 kms away.  Then I new it was an UFO since there was no deflection or change in brightness as if it was bright all around it.  There was no air traffic that we could tel! l and I ran to get my binoculars while my son spotted for me.  When I came back outside, he said it had just disappeared. He said it diminished in size rapidly and it was as if the very bright white light that had been emmitting from it grew very small and disappeared.  We both surmized that it accelerated at high speeed to space.  The light was quite clear, extremely bright and pure white in colour.  Its intensity did not pulse nor did it blink, just a consistent magnitude and colour.  As soon as it disappeared there was air traffic moving from west to east at approximately FL7, 7,000 feet and descending to Toronto. We saw at least one aircraft flying the opposite direction, east to west, also. So, at least 4 aircraft in all as soon as the UFO disappeared.;43.4781836653387;-80.5436011952192
08/29/2012 Kitchener Ontario Light 1-Minute Very Bright High Altitude Light then 'Disappearing'.;2012-08-29 23:55:00;1 minute;08/29/2012 Kitchener Ontario Light 1-Minute Very Bright High Altitude Light then 'Disappearing'. At 11:55 i stepped outside to grab some air. As i looked toward the South/East i spotted a very bright light. The light was travelling South, and appeared to be very high in altitude. I had no other aircraft to compare with for distance and speed.  As it travelled it began to 'Dim', knowing that a Jet uses a spotlight on occasion,and travelling Toward Me would usually explain this, it doesn't explain how it could be that bright While Flying Away from Me. It eventually faded into nothing.  I've checked some Satellite Trackers, and there were none slated for a 'Fly-By' at the time posted. Also 'No Sound' to be heard.  Thank-You.;43.4781836653387;-80.5436011952192
Flashing, strobing bright light at high altitutde performs zig zag like maneuvers;2016-12-07 17:15:00;3 minutes;Flashing, strobing bright light at high altitutde performs zig zag like maneuvers Hi Peter,   On December 07, at 5:15 pm, I went outside to have a cigarette.  It was a clear day and the sun was just going down and it was close to civil twilight.  I noticed a bunched of planes in the sky, then spotted a larger, brighter light just above the horizon.  I quickly grabbed my phone and started recording, as I realized this object seemed stationary, and it was pulsing like no other identifiable craft I have seen.  I watched it for a few minutes and tracked it as it moved in a straight line heading northwest over my head.  I observed and filmed this pulsing object for about six minutes and watched it slowly travel on a straight trajectory heading north west. I looked at other planes in the sky nearby and compared it to what I was watching.  On the planes in the sky you could just barely see the red and green strobe lights and you could see the plane body still lit up by the existing daylight.  This brighter pulsing light  had no visible coloured lights like navigation lights that strobed like aviation lights.  At first I accepted the possibility that it was an aircraft heading straight towards me with the landing lights or collision lights on.  But then noticed it was constantly pulsing, moving very slowly upwards, almost stationary.  I also thought this bright pulsing object was a satellite or maybe the ISS, but it was only 5:16 pm and in the stage civil twilight, it was still not dark enough to see any stars.  This light was as bright as Jupiter or Venus but a bit larger. After watching the video over a couple of times I noticed a peculiar movement as it got over head and thought that the strobing frequency changed but couldn't really calculate it accurately.  At about 30 seconds in, the light seems to changing its speed and direction.  I could calculate that the light deviated from its original straight trajectory.  Judging the distance from the electrical cord hanging down from the eave-trough of the roof that is visible in the second video, you can see that the pulsing object appears to slow down, and then dives down to the left, and then zips back down to the right, and then zips up to the left on its former trajectory. I later stabilized the shaky camera footage and the zig zag movement becomes very clear. I could not see the object clearly at all times while filming the second video as it was over head.  It was heading into some cloud cover and just pointed the phone camera at where I saw it last.  It seemed to be completely behind some clouds so I stopped filming. I had to report this to you at NUFOC.  I heard you on Podcast UFO and think you are the most hardworking guy in the field!  Thanks for all your years or dedication and service!  You're the man, Peter...
