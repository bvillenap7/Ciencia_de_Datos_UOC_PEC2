ROUND GRAY CLUSTER STATIOARY IN SKY THEN SLOWLY ROSE UP AND THEN AT AMAZING SPEED DISAPPEARED WITHOUT SOUND;2006-06-12 11:00:00;30 seconds;ROUND GRAY CLUSTER STATIONARY IN SKY THEN SLOWLY ROSE UP AND THEN AT AMAZING SPEED DISAPPEARED WITHOUT SOUND To whom it may concern,   I have not nor was I planning to give information on the incident that both my wife and I experienced in June of 2006 but after seeing your web site I was compelled to get it reported, so here goes. June 2006 my wife and I had left home and drove to the intersection of Redfox and Davenport Rd in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, where when stopped at the stop sign, we both observed what initially appeared to be a cluster of balloons in a perfectly round shape we would estimate about 300 feet in the air to our right.  This was a clear day with unlimited visibility and the object was maybe the size of about 50 feet round. The object that at that moment I assumed due to the metallic gray color was a weather balloon caught our attention because it did not move for several seconds.  The cluster then started to climb ever so slowly straight up and suddenly flew up at a blinding speed and then disappeared into the daytime sky without ever making any sound. Please note, I and my wife sincerely believe now that we witnessed an object that defies anything man made due to the fact that nothing could have been still like that and then moved at the amazing rate of speed it did without a sonic boom or some sound being emitted. Thanks for letting us share this, regards. ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));43.4781836653387;-80.5436011952192
fast object,no sound ,no lights pure speed.;2008-08-27 00:19:00;7 seconds;fast object,no sound ,no lights pure speed. i was just out watching the stars on a beautiful clear night,the stars where bright and very visual,it was better than usual,like i was in the country, out of the glare of the city lights. i was having a cigarette and looking up ,when all of a sudden i saw a object race across the sky,it took about 5 to seven second to go from one horizontal plane to the other in a west to east direction. i could see it against the night sky as it appeared to be a light shade of brown. it was only about 4 mm in size to my eye as it was up there. there where no flashing lights and no sound whatsoever,it was almost like a meteor had gone by,but i ruled that out as a possibility because it would have burned up in the atmosphere,and if it was high enough i surely wouldnt see it. it was not a satilite ,ive seen those before in the night sky and it didnt come close to resembling anything we put up there. so i conclude it as a ufo period. scared the hell out of me. it was so fast ,wow!!
