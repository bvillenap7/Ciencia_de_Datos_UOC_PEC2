Crescent shaped object zig-zagging WNW above Waterloo, Ontario, Canada;2000-10-21 01:30:00;10 secs (approx);Crescent shaped object zig-zagging WNW above Waterloo, Ontario, Canada It was about 1:30 in the morning, and I was walking back to my friend's apartment.  I looked up at the stars, and saw what I believed to be a satellite going over.  The problem was, however, that there was a shape to the object, and that it deviated from its straight course of flight.  The object appeared to be quite high, and crescent-like in shape.  Its general direction was roughly WNW, and changed its course several times, almost zig-zagging.  After a few seconds, it moved behind some trees, so I moved a few feet over, and couldn't re-locate it.  I realize that this is pretty vague, and probably isn't of much use to you.
