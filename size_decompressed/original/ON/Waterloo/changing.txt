3 spheres, changing colours and shape, moving among the clouds;2003-07-13 16:00:00;40 minutes;3 spheres, changing colours and shape, moving among the clouds SAW 3 UFO's in 1 hour. In the middle of the day. The first was this little thing way up in the sky, it was round, and was turning in different directiions, and looked like it had one big wing on it.. it was changing colours, from orange to pink, then almost a silver colour as it rose up and moved left and right, then slowly across the sky.. until all i could see is this tiny white speck, that looked like a base ball in the distance.  The second one was a tiny white base ball figure moving up and down and left and right in the sky wayyyy far in the horizon- And the third was a  rather large sphere that looked pink colour, then almost a yellow, moving west wards in the sky, really slow. no wings, no perpellars, no basket.. just a sphere.. it almost shook up and down while tracing the depths of the sky. This all happened within 40 minutes.;43.4781836653387;-80.5436011952192
