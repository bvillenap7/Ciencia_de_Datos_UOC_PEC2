Quick mirror-like flashes from small object following commercial plane trail;2021-02-17 14:45:00;1:00;Quick mirror-like flashes from small object following commercial plane trail I was the passenger in a car. After seeing and looking up at the trail of an airplane fuel thing, my eye was caught by a quick flash to the left of the trail.  This flash occured twice before I could concentrate on it, I moved around in my seat just to make sure it wasn't glare from the windshield, and it moved extremely abrubtly towards the fuel trail. I asked my dad if he could see it, and it flashed again a few times before moving what seemed like furher away but same elevation. He looked around and didn't see it fully, but did notice the last flash.  The flashes were very much like that you would see if someone far away was turning a mirror at the sun and pointing it quickly at your eyes. It was up too high for it to be a reflective satellite dish, farming structures, radio/cell towers. There are no mountains or anything either.  We continued up the road, a straight road, and I kept my eyes locked on it, and suddenly wuth the last flash it was gone. There was an airplane far off to tge right of my vision, and there was 100% absolutely something in the air watching it or following it or investigating the trail.;45.2754;-75.2889
