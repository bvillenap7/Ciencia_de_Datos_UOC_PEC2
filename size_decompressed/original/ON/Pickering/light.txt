Halloween light falling straight down in the sky.;2000-10-31 19:00:00;20 secs;Halloween light falling straight down in the sky. My brother and I were taking his son around the streets for Hallowe'en .  We stopped cause the child was at a door.  We were looking down the street and we saw in the sky, a star - or so we thought.  It appeared to be a shooting star heading SW, but it stopped dead in the sky and then just started falling straight down.  The reason why this was so strange to us was because it stopped and went in an exact straight line down into the horizan till we couldn't see it cause of trees - it wasn't a fast fall either.  We stood there for what seems like 30 secs watching this thing fall. I'm surprised not more people noticed it was so weird to see something falling straight down. We looked at each other and commented on how weird it was.  He is a huge skeptic yet believed this was something out of the norm. This event has bothered me ever since, so I came on the internet to look up UFOs  and sure enough I found this site.  And I notice there were other weird sightings on Halloween.  Could they be related? I never told anyone this story but I've seen the same thing about 12 years ago, looking out the window one night.  I run down to tell my mother who thought I was kidding..  The next morning she ran to my room saying that the news had reporting several UFO sightings from all over - that night.

Star like object falling straight down out of the sky.;2000-10-31 19:00:00;30 sec.;Star like object falling straight down out of the sky. On Halloween, my brother and I were taking my nephew out for Trick or Treat.  We looked up at what we thought was a shooting star. It stopped and then fell straight down towards the horizon at a slow speed. We paid special attention because it was moving so slowly and straight, unlike any other shooting star we've seen before. Never thought much about it until I heard about this web page and read a similar story. I've heard stories in the past that Pickering in a hot spot for sighting, I guess because of the Nuclear Power Planet.;43.856674;-79.120136

Bright light changing from red to white in northeast daylight sky at 60 degrees.;2014-08-29 12:25:00;10 minutes;Wife's Report: Bright light changing from red to white in northeast daylight sky at 60 degrees. Day light sighting of an illuminating pulsing stationary light.  At 12:25 pm dst in the clear northeast sky at a 60 degree angle of view witness a lighted object that was white then changed to red and back to white then red and disappeared, then reappeared and went through the same sequences.  I observed this through binoculars with a power of 8x42 at 6.5 degree field.  It seemed to disappear from the field of view.  This may  have been the shaking of myself and the binoculars but I am almost certain that it vanished  It also seemed to be moving very slightly to the left in a rising manner.   After ten minutes it got lost in some light clouds.  I never regained the object. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere and serious-minded.  His wife witnessed the object, as well.  PD));43.856674;-79.120136
Bright light travelling over Pickering Ontario,  stopped for a minute and the disappeared;2020-03-05 18:45:00;2 minutes;Bright light travelling over Pickering Ontario,  stopped for a minute and the disappeared I saw a bright light moving through the sky, which I thought was the International space station and it was traveling from a north east direction heading southwest. I continued to watch it for about 1 minute expecting the light to diminish as it travelled further southwest, however it stopped and remained stationary for approximately 1 minute and then just disappeared. The night sky was crystal clear. The path the light was travelling was between Venus to the west and the moon to the east when it stopped directly in the middle of both Venus and the moon.;43.856674;-79.120136

Ball of white light travelling at incredible speed 300 ft off the ground and perfectly horizontally.;2020-12-17 22:50:00;2 seconds;Ball of white light travelling at incredible speed 300 ft off the ground and perfectly horizontally. As I was driving home from work on Thursday December 17 at 22:50, I observed a ball of white light travelling at incredible speed.  The ball of light was travelling north, appeared to be about 300 feet off the ground, and was travelling perfectly horizontally. The light appeared to be about 800 to 1000 feet east of the road I was travelling on (Brock Rd., south of Hwy 407, Pickering, Ontario, Canada).  Lake Ontario is roughly 20kms south of where I saw the light.  The sighting only lasted about 2 seconds due to the incredible speed of the ball of light. It did not strike me as a meteor or shooting star type of light in the sky as I have seen many times over my life.  This was something different.;43.856674;-79.120136
