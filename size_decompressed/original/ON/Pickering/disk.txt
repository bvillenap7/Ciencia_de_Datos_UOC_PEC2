Intially spotted East of a 3 way stop in the Eastern Sky over Whiteville (Corner of Whiteville Rd and Altona Rd). Bright saucer shape. Appeared to be silver but reflecting like a mirror. Remained stationary for the duration of the sighting, but disappeared out of a perfectly clear blue sky when I took my gaze off the object. The lack of movement made the object catch and hold my attention. The sighting was brief, eerie and unexplained.;43.856674;-79.120136
