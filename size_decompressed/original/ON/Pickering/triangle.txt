Oh ya those dimensions were the width as it passed I heard nothing but after it passed I could see afterburners on the back big enough you could drive a transport into.  This vessel must have been man made because it was very shingley and rivety and was in dark almost military colours.  I reported this event to Mufon in the mid 1990.  Still have no seen nothing like this. ((NUFORC Note:  The Snowbirds, the Canadian Aerobatic Team, experienced a fatal accident in Toronto in 1989.  We do not know the month of the accident.
