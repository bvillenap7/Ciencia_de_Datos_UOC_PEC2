chrome sphere reflecting noon sun on straight NW to SE trajectory;2002-05-15 13:00:00;20 seconds;chrome sphere reflecting noon sun on straight NW to SE trajectory While driving on the 401 westbound on the left express lane (approximate speed of travel 130km/hr) in Pickering, ON  (http://maps.google.ca/maps?hl=en&ie=UTF8&ll=43.824898,-79.095726&spn=0.024057,0.06609&t=h&z=15),  spotted bright object approximately 10km away through front windshield of car.  At first, thought it was local Durham Regional Police helicopter and thought to myself, this guy is in a hurry.  As object came closer, noticed it was a perfectly chrome sphere and reflecting the noon sun.  Object passed over car at about ~25feet over highway (just above street light height) and followed straight horizontal trajectory.  I would estimate the size of the object to be ~0.75m diameter.  Object appeared to have a cylindrical protrusion (1/4 size of sphere) which showed that it was rotating slightly.  Saw object from driver-side window and noticed object was headed towards direction of Pickering Nuclear Power Plant.  I continued to drive westbound.  No clouds in sky.  Slight breeze.  Many other motorists on highway at the time of sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));43.856674;-79.120136
