Quick sightings of 2 flying objects... not of this world!;2000-10-19 00:15:00;5 - 10 minutes;Quick sightings of 2 flying objects... not of this world! While walking my dog in the park, directly behind my house, as I have for the past 7+ years, I was wishing upon a star as entering.  Upon this wish, I had noticed that this 'star' was moving.  Thinking I was maybe lucky to be wishing upon a falling star, I watched it.  It was no star.  It was moving far too closely...  far too fast, and did not fade out.  The light was to my left and I followed it.   As it got closer, I noticed red and greed flashing lights spinning in a circular motion.  This was no plane, helicopter, nor any other flying object I am aware of.  As my eyes followed further, there was another object of the same directly, and hovering, over me.   The two met, as if to collide, and each then went seperate ways.   I have never experienced nor witnessed any such a thing.  Ever. This incident was very close to my house.  One of the objects was still in my view as I aproached my house, my dog barking wildly at nothing.  I ran to the door and called for my brother to 'come quick!'.  However, it was gone that fast. To say the least, I'm a little 'freaked out'!;43.856674;-79.120136
The light went up and down a few times then went in a circular motion and dissapeared within seconds.;2003-07-05 22:30:00;10-20  seconds;The light went up and down a few times then went in a circular motion and dissapeared within seconds. I was sitting at the beach with some friends and i saw a bright yellow/white light.  I thought at first it was an airplane then i thought it was too high in the sky to be a plane or a chopper.  I was going to mention it to my friends but there were a few people there hanging out that i never met before and i didn't want to sound like a paranoid freak.  Then the light went up and down maybe three times, then took off really fast in a circular motion.  And it was gone within seconds.  I never actually saw a craft just the light.;43.856674;-79.120136
There were 4 sometimes 5 seperate crafts with one bright light each which was all you could see and  were changing formations.;2003-10-12 21:15:00;A few hours;There were 4 sometimes 5 seperate crafts with one bright light each which was all you could see and  were changing formations. My friend was driving me home from work at 9:15 p.m.  I work in an old barn converted theatre and it is surrounded by open fields for miles. Some of our other co-workers who left in 1 car just before us turned back to tells us there are U.F.O.s in the sky so my friend and i drove towards it but it must have been really far away because we weren't getting any closer but the light was so bright we thought it was close. It started off as 4 seperate crafts, although like one i had seen months before i couldnt see the actual craft just one bright like to each craft.  The lights started off as 3 in a line then one under the middle light. As we got closer we could only see 3 then one would be really low to the ground then one would be really high.  The formations were always changing but the lights were always where we could see them.  I called my brother at 9:30 who was babysitting to tell him and he didn't really believe me then at about midnight when he was driving home from babysitting he and his girlfriend saw the same thing in the same direction I saw it in.;43.856674;-79.120136
Glowing blue sphere in Ontario, Canada.;2013-10-11 16:01:00;5 minutes;Glowing blue sphere in Ontario Canada I am 47 years old, I have never seen a UFO.  I am not a big believer in UFO's but I can not explain this.  The photos I took visually confirm the story. I was driving home from work when I looked up through my windshield and saw the strangest vapour trails I had ever seen.  I work in Aerospace, I have travelled around the world over 12 times...I have seen a lot of vapour trails and they are not uncommon on this part of my drive home.  But these vapour trails were like nothing I have ever seen.  They were so strange it made someone like me get out of the car and shoot them with my phone camera. I thought they looked that strange. There were multiple trails, they were dashed and dotted almost like Morse code and they were moving in multiple different directions as if produced by multiple craft moving in multiple different directions. Unfortunately I was shooting into the sun so I took many shots hoping one of them would show these vapour trails. It was several days later before I even looked at my photos, I could barely make out a few streaks because of the sun glare but my camera caught a floating, glowing blue object in 5 of the 8 photos I took.  I did not see this glowing blue object, I was trying to shoot the vapour trails so I was stunned to find it in the photos. PHOTO 1: Glowing blue sphere hiding behind a tree behind intersection. (4:01 pm) PHOTO 2: Photo of my car to prove I was there and not making this up. (4:01 pm) PHOTO 3: Glowing blue object in front of intersection 5 or so feet off ground beside a pick-up truck. (4:02 pm) PHOTO 4: Object not visible. (4:02 pm) PHOTO 5: Object appears 50-60 feet above intersection (4:02 pm) PHOTO 6: Object appears 80-100 feet above and behind intersection (4:02 pm) PHOTO 7: Object very bright 10 or so feet above intersection (4:02 pm) PHOTO 8: I was back in my car and moving again and took one last shot of the vapour trails through my windshield yet camera records an explosion in the trees on far side of the intersection. (4:06 pm) None of the other drivers in the photos stopped, none of them swerved or showed any signs of seeing something unusual. I didn't see anything myself other then the strange vapour trails in the sky, yet my phone camera definitely caught a glowing blue sphere moving in all three axis (X,Y,Z) right in front of many people and yet no one seemed to see it at all. I thought is it a defect of my camera or lens? Yet no other photo I have taken with it shows anything like this. The camera was a Nokia 920. None of the photos have been altered in anyway.;43.856674;-79.120136
Small round white ball shape hovering in the sky.;2014-08-29 12:20:00;10 minutes;Husband's Report:  Small round white ball shape hovering in the sky. It first appeared as a small white round ball.  It seemed to be spinning, and at the same time, moving around in a small circle.   I lost sight of it and then found it slightly lower than when i first saw it.   It still appeared to be spinning and moving around in a small circle, but was now glowing red, then white and disappear.   It continued this way for a least 10 minutes and then it disappeared and never saw it again.   We were looking in the north east direction.;43.856674;-79.120136
