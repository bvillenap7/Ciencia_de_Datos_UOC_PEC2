Sitting eating dinner outside, we noticed a black coloured square floating above our house. It was hard to tell but we think it was about 400metres in the air.  Looked like a piece of paper, not a cube.  It made no noise and there were no lights on it. It sat still for about 1 minute, then began to sway.  When it started to move we thought it might be a kite, but realized there was no string and it was too high up. It stopped moving again and sat still for about another minute before slowly flying away and out of site. I captured it on my phone photo and video.;43.856674;-79.120136
