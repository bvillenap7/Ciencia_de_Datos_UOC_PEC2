(Initially I thought it was a shooting star except it wasn't moving.) Then from the star shape a bright red beam appeared.(It looked about an inch long and seemed to head north and up.) At the other end of this another white flash of light appeared then the entire object faded out. The whole event lasted at most 3 seconds.;43.856674;-79.120136
