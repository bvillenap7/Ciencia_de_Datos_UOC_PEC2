Odd shaped diamond, bright white in the sky over a neighbours house that last about 5 minutes and just vanished;2012-07-27 22:00:00;5 minutes;an odd shaped diamond, bright white in the sky over a neighbours house that last about 5 minutes and just vanished I just purchased this computer and do not have a word processor or not one that i can find on here anywhere. Last night around 10pm, what seem to be over the house across the street i noticed a bright odd shaped light.  I would describe the shape as a diamond but not perfectly shaped. It was all bright white and hallow. I ran in side to get my camera and took some picture but for some reason it would not show up on my camera, i do have a few pictures and when i zoom in on them i am not exactly sure what i am looking at. There was only one and it was only there for no more then five minutes and it just dissapeared. As if someone turned the lights out and was no longer there. Can someone please help me to understand what i saw last night, it would be much appreciated.;43.856674;-79.120136
