The only descrepancy was that it did not appear to have any wings. It looked like the space shuttle coming in for a landing but without the V shaped wings. It tool approx 1 min to come into view and then leave the other way. There were other commercial jets in the sky directly behind the object. I beleive it was a military or test vehicle but have never seen anything like this before. ((NUFORC Note:  The witness provides four digital photographs of the object.  It is seen leaving two contrails behind each wing, so we presume that the object is powered by air-breathing engines.  The object has the general appearance of a military jet fighter.  We do not know what type of aircraft it is, but we do not believe it is a UFO.  PD));43.856674;-79.120136
