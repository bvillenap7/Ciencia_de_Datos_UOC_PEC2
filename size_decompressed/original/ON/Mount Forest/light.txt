Blue light in the sky between the moon and a bright star to the east.  ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter?  PD));2009-07-09 03:00:00;2 hours;Blue light in the sky between the moon and a bright star to the east. Last night I was photographing the Moon approximately 3:00. In my photos I found a blue spot just to the east of the moon. My photos were not very good so the spot only showed up when I tried to enhance the photos. I have chased UFOs in the past, and found them ether undetermined or something neat. One UFO I chased was on a cloudy night. I was travelling from Shelburn Ontario Canada to Mount Forest Ontario by the back roads when I spotted these coloured lights in the sky. They were fuzzy and dull and looked as if they were moving. I decided to see how close I could get to the lights and I started to follow them. After several miles of following the lights in the sky I could see a cell tower through the trees. The cell towers lights were the same colour as the lights in the sky. When I got to the base of the cell tower I could see that the lights in the sky were the lights from the cell tower reflecting off the clouds in the sky. The clouds were moving and it was the moving clouds that made the lights look like they were moving. Any way has anyone been photographing the Moon lately? If you have did you spot the blue light east of the Moon? There was a bright star to the east of the Moon and the blue light was between the star and the Moon. The blue light was not visible to the naked eye it was only when I tried to enhance the photos it showed up on all of them. I spotted it on July 9 2009 at approximately 3:00 am. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the person might have photographed Jupiter, which is near the Moon, currently.  PD));43.9796;-80.7231
