star emulating craft with multicolored rapid flashing lights - swift movement.;2011-06-18 23:00:00;10 Minutes +;Star emulating craft with multicolored rapid flashing lights - swift movement to the left with immidiate stop and still Event took place 11PM GMT-5 Eastern  Sitting in driveway waiting to pick up sister. look to south and notice a cluster of 3 stars arranged in a vertical line (slightly triangular - center star to left of vertical allignment halfway between upper and lower stars)  Center star is flashing rapaidly an assortment of blue/purple/orange/red/white/green colors. at first i assumed it was an airplane, satalite, or even a space station. continue to watch star constantly without a break in attention. after a while i noticed the UFO hasnt been moving - not even slightly. After about 1 - 2 minutes of constant eye contact, the UFO makes a sudden rapid movement - not very fast but a relatively quick movement to the left, and has a quick and effortless stop on the opposite side of the sxtar cluster. When movement ceased (1-2 seconds) it remained absolutely still as a mirror image of its former location. UFO remained in position until i left 5~ minutes later (not by choice)  this is not a prank or joke, i am serious about this. i undertsna dand took university physics. i know that a plane would have to be aimed directly at you, or directly away from you to appear to have no motion comparative to you. they have a slow constant motion in one direction. The same applies to a satalite or a space station - al be it slow motion, they would still move slowly over time. I can tell the difference between constant motion and sudden motion.  This was a real ufo a few kilometers into the distance.;44.6050227272727;-80.5931045454545
