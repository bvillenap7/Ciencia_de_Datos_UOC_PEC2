Brilliant enou;2005-12-16 21:30:00;5 to 10 seconds;Driving south from Collingwood on Hwy 10 and saw a streaking ball across the south eastern sky moving from east to west.  Brilliant enough to see while I was driving on the highway with headlights.  Pointed it out to passanger - passanger in car and we both looked amazed as it faded below the horizon.  It started an orange red colour and then turned greenish before going to red orangish again.  Not sure if it was meteor, astroid or flying craft such as a satellite or other but it was definately brilliant and occured on the same night as many of the others in your reported sightings occured.  I am a journalist by profession and am only telling you what we saw.   Will have to go back and check work schedule to make certain of date but it was the same time as appeared in many news reports about same event.;44.4798999999999;-80.2168000000001

This object would get so bright it would light up the sky you could see all clowds around it looked like a sun but a little smaller. It really looked like fire!. it would light up then after a little while go out and it repeated this about 5 or 6 times.  sometimes it would go out for abuot 15 mins and come back for a good minute then a second light apeard to the left after the first one went out. this was always at the same spot in the sky. the plane or whatever it was that was going around it once the ball was out it would move from left to right and it changed direction way to fast for a plane any ways i just want to know what this was it wasnt something ive ever seen.   anyone frome creiglithe, collingwood or wasaga beach could of seen this.;44.4798999999999;-80.2168000000001
