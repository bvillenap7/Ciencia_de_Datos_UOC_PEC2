At about 8:50 pm my wife and I observed what at first appeared to be 2 orange stars until I realized they were moving. They seemed to be moving in a south eastern direction with one in front of the other almost as if it were a plane with one light on the front and one on the back. As we watched the trailing light appeared to move further to the east almost as if the craft was swinging its nose towards us and its tail away from us (and while the trailing light was making this move it started to dim as if its light were starting to become obscured by the body of the craft) till the trailing light could no longer be seen. As the single remaining light continued in the same direction it also started dimming till it also vanished. Total passage of time for this event was at the most 30 seconds. My wife works for an answering service and I work in a factory.;44.4798999999999;-80.2168000000001
