Noticed a round orange object in the south west heading east.  When it got to our house, it began to rise & then disappeared.  Called my wife out & as we watched, they began coming in very quickly in singles, twos & then 3's shaped liked a triangle,   Thought they may have been fireworks, but only orange in color, no noise or trailers.  Thought may have been a flare, but flares go straight up & then down,& do not fly west to east. Neighbors across the road & beside us were out, but their dogs were barking frantically, which is unusual. We did take pictures but you do need a larger screen to see them.  We are retired & I do not drink, so I know I wasn't seeing things. with our digital camera that shows the;44.1261;-78.5143
