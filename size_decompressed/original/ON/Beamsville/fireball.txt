Bright Light fireball over head in West Sky September 21st  Southern Ontario Canada sighting lasted aprox 1/2 hour;2006-09-21 21:00:00;20 min plus;Bright Light fireball over head in West Sky September 21st  Southern Ontario Canada sighting lasted aprox 1/2 hour Aprox  9:00pm on Sept 21st  stepped out on balcony to have a smoke.  I was star gazing and happend to notice what a clear night it was.  Something caught my eye in the west sky  above the tree line- at first I thought it was Mars  it was very bright and had an orage glow to it, but soon realized that was not the case-- i thought this light ball was a huge star, or plane with headlights on  but when it stayed stationary for a while i realized  that was not what I was looking at.  I called my son to come see and just to verify that my eyes were not playing tricks on me.  We stood and watched this thing for aprox  1/2 hour,  it seemed to dance a little  side to side  up and down , it also seemed to get brighter and dim  as well as changed colors    then it did a strange thing it seemed like it had a huge High beam of light  for a few seconds then dimmed again.  then we noticed it shooting smaller pieces  up from it - if i had to describe it  - it was almost like a sparkler  but only shooting from the top  aproxamatly  4 or 5 sparks came off .  I put my kids to bed at aprox 9:30- i came back upstairs to balcony aprox  9:45  only to see it  shut off  it never zoomed away or took off  it just seemed to turn  OFF  this is not the first encounter I have had I have seen other things like this in the past  but it has been a few years  and nothing as amazing as this-- I actually had a panic feeling to myself  yet I HAD  TO SEE - not sure if anyone has and anything like this  but I felt I had to tell someone..  I can't give you an exact size  i could only compare sige by  extending my arm full length and then the size of my pinky fingernail was the size  and the sparks shot up about 1/4 inch. Unfortunatly i was not able to take pictures  there was no film in my 35  and my digital  decided to no longer function.;43.1713;-79.4809
