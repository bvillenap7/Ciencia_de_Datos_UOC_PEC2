It was 11.20 am. I went out with coffee and smoke looked around in the sky and felt I should get my video camera.  So I went and got the video camera, put it on tripod, and had 28-135 lens on my camera on the chair beside me.  I then sat and looked around in the sky, I then noticed a definite silver shine to my west pretty far away, I donâ€™t know how high it was from the ground, I was faceing north the craft was west moving slowly south, I grabbed the camera and waited to see if it was the craft, another shine off a sphere slowly moving south. I ripped some shots then grabbed the video camera and tried to aim, the object dimmed and shone reflecting light I figured from the sun.  I dropped the video camera and solely shot with the camera, it was hard to shoot because the sunlight would shine then go out, shine then go out as it traveled south each time I had to refocus and fire.  I got 19 shots in Raw Data images not the best but I got them, heres the enlarged and enhanced photos. ((NUFORC Note:  Photos not of a genuine UFO, we believe.  One of four reports from same source.
