V-shaped craft stationary in pearson airport flight path.;2014-07-26 21:00:00;1 hour;V-shaped craft stationary in pearson airport flight path I am writing this on behalf of my mother who witnessed and photographed the V-shaped craft.  It was sitting stationary for over an hour, the crazy thing being it was directly in the Eastern flight path of YYZ Pearson airport!  She said planes were going right and left to dodge the stationary craft.   Neighbor phoned the police, they said what can we do about it.    I'll email both pictures, one from daytime and one from night.   As the sun went down the craft lit up and mom said it was flashing.  She went back to look a while after taking 2nd pic and it was gone.;43.783;-79.4122
