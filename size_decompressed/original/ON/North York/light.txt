Two motionless hazy white lights in bright morning sky supported by nothing.;2013-02-20 07:00:00;2 minutes;Two motionless hazy white lights in bright morning sky supported by nothing. We had a very heavy snow storm one day in southern Ontario in mid-February. I was driving to work the morning after from my home town of Brampton eastward on Finch ave. to North York Toronto.  The air was heavy with mist and fog and at about 7:00am (quite bright, not dark) I stopped at the red lights at an intersection a few Km from my work destination. I looked northward to my left and saw two white hazy lights in the sky which looked quite odd. They looked to be about 150 meters away horizontally and at a 45degree elevation and they were separated horizontally and vertically by about 2 degrees. They were totally motionless as if fixed to a pole or building,  I could not see any such structure below them and if there was, I should have been able to from that distance even though the fog was there. I began wondering if they were from a chopper, but there was no sound, a plane but there was no movement and it definitely couldnâ€™t be from a balloon. As I started moving again on the green, I kept looking back as much as I could and for as long as I could and there was no apparent movement.  The next morning while on my to work again, the sky was totally clear and as I passed the same spot I thoroughly checked to see if there was any very tall supporting structure that was obscured by the fog and there was absolutely none. I am a Mechanical Engineer and a backyard astronomer and will readily identify natural earthbound objects I am totally convinced that those lights were from an unknown/unnatural source.
