Possible UFO sighting East sky of North York (GTA) Ontario.;2014-07-04 23:38:00;30 second;Possible UFO sighting East sky of North York (GTA) Ontario. At 23:38, I was walking home from work in North York (Greater Toronto Area) Ontario.   I thought it was a satellite going across the sky.  It was fading in and out towards the East.   It was white, then turned orange as it faded.  I was a circle shape.  It was travelling straight then it went sideways and jolted north and vanished!  I've never seen a satellite do that.;43.783;-79.4122
