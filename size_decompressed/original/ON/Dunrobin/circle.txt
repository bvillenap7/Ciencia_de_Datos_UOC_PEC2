Bright white light with less intense light suspended below, not moving rapidly, observed over 40 minutes.;2013-10-28 06:20:00;45 minutes;Bright white light with less intense light suspended below, not moving rapidly, observed over 40 minutes. Driving home from Ottawa to Dunrobin I saw a bright white light ahead and to the right (north).  I thought it was the landing lights of an approaching aircraft.  There was a second less intense light below it that moved with it as if suspended.  It did not appear to be approaching as fast as a jet would.  I made a right (northerly) turn and observed the light now to my left.  It seemed suspended in the sky at an altitude of perhaps 800-1000 meters.   A left turn kept the object on my left where it stayed for 15 minutes in much the same position, but moving slowly west away from me. Upon arriving home my wife and I went outside with binoculars and observed the object for 15 minutes.  It was definitely two lights vertically positioned.  It did not appear to be moving in the sky although it was now some distance further west.  It moved much too slowly for a plane and the intensity of the lights did not change.  A planet or star would not have changed position relative to my travel.  Perhaps it was a weather balloon drifting slowly.  At the closest point it seemed to less than a mile away and was very bright.  It may have receded to a distance of 10- 15 miles when stopped observing.;45.4211;-76.0268
