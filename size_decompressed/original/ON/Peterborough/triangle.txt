Was coming home after an evening at my singing group and an object followed my car down the street.  I heard a large noise and I was given a command that came into my mind, Not to move.  Then I felt like the object was going over top of my car and I remember thinking I would have to see what it was as it seemed to move to the right.  I looked out car window, it was difficult to see, it was very dark, no Moon was out, and I saw a triangular shaped object I thought was some military plane, but it was too low, it barely cleared a house and it had a few small lights in the back of it, hardly visible, the craft was moving very slowly as if it was huffering.  Then it was gone.  I remember getting a message that it was O.K. it was just a plane, not to worry.  I was not even upset, but looked at my watch when I came in the driveway and it was 22:55.  I had lost some time.  Even though I seemed to be in a non caring state I still wondered were it went and I thought I should be able to see it.  It was as if they gave me a message not too worry and not to think twice about what happened.  Later it kind of felt like it could not have happened, but it did.  Later I thought about when I was looking out the window and I felt a little strange like I was fighting a trance.  For the next two weeks I was very tired.  The colour of object was black, like black metal.  I think I noticed my car lights inside car flick once as it was pulling up. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of alleged event is approximate.

Triangular Object Circling Subdivision.;2018-09-26 21:05:00;5 minutes;Triangular Object Circling Subdivision Was leaving my subdivision, when my roomate and I noticed a triangular object in the sky.  It had white/green lights on each point of the triangle with different coloured lights blinking under the craft.  We also noted that the object was flying lower and much faster than a commercial plane would have been.  It was also flying in a weird pattern, making large circling patters and weaving in and out.  Nothing like how a regular plane would fly.   For a moment we thought that maybe it could be a drone but the object would have been far too large to be a drone if it were on the ground.   After a few minutes we could no longer see it in the sky, as we were driving away from it, after exiting the subdivision.   This happened off of Airport Road in the South West end of Peterborough, ON.;44.3174816901409;-78.2840647887323
