Twisting tube like object floating in the sky;2009-06-12 12:30:00;15 minutes;Twisting tube like object floating in the sky When I first saw the object, I was driving South on Goodfellow Rd., approaching Lansdowne St.  The object appeared to be a long stationary line in the sky straight ahead of me.  Still watching the object I continued driving South through the intersection and into the Chapters parking lot. I stood there for about five minutes, watching this thing. It seemed to be a long dark tube about 15 to 20 feet long. It would slowly twist, turn and bend. Sometimes floating upward or downward.  At one point it was bent like a right angle, with the bend part pointing upward.  The ends of this tube object were blunt not pointy.  It acted like a giant slow moving snake. There were three people in a parked car close by, so I showed them the object. They were also amazed.  After watching it for a few more minutes, we all decided to get in our cars and try to follow the object for a closer look.  We met up a little further South but could no longer find it. I'm wondering if it was some type of kite that I don't know about.  The weather is sunny with a few clouds, winds about 7 km. I told the other witnesses about this site, hopefully they submit a report.;44.3174816901409;-78.2840647887323
