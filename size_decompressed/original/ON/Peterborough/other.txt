I did this often as a kid (I was about 8 when this happened).  I watched a relatively small and extremely low lightning cloud in what was otherwise a clear sky.  It was approximately one hundred feet off the ground, and moving very slowly.  It seemed to stop in mid sky and turn right, silently moving until out of sight. I vaguely recall getting into bed after what seemed to be a short time sitting at the window, but the sky was getting brighter.  I know it was quite late at night when I sat at the window because I was having a hard time falling asleep. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

(obviously trying to break the ice, but make no mistake, my life has been changed forever with what i have to share. anybody who has seriously seen anything like i have, know's exactly how unbelievably life changing it can be, although only for some. I am shocked beond anger, that i can show anyone who wants to see what i am seeing, (like my christian wife, who refuses to think of the possibilities of extra terrestrial life). I have tried to explain to her that in my opinnion this helps me believe that maybe there really is a god. Enough about all this, hoevver i just want you to understand i have a very good job and an amazing family and i am a need to see it for my self type scientific mind. on the evening of october ninth it was a clear cool night and i was on my back deck facing the south when i noticed the brightest star i thi! nk i had ever seen, while watching this  star or what i thought was a star i noticed two more orange smaller stars around it, and they were moving at incredible speeds and in every which way.  Diagonal, up down, in a circle unlike any known technology today. now that is just the beginning i have stories over the next week and today even as i write this. I am at an absolute loss for words with what i have seen. nobody would believe me if i told them.  I would never waste this much time on a computer for some wack job story like this. please someone who knows about this or cares contact me. i will show you what i am talking about and i have more really freaky stories, if you don't see anything than i would even pay for your time i just need someone to help, i feel like life and everything in it right now is.....has changed. imagine the possibilities of other beings, eternal life, happiness, or the opposite. how can so many people be so ignorantly scared. please contact me.;44.3174816901409;-78.2840647887323
Large white light in southern sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus, we suspect.  PD));2013-11-18 17:30:00;30 mins in 15 min interva;Large white light in southern sky. Was just waking up and coming down for dinner.  The wife and step kids told me about a large white light they saw in the southern sky.  They said it moved to the east in the sky and eventually it faded out.   As I was sitting having dinner it came back.  A large white light in the southern sky, that would dart to the east and then back.   Their first sighting lasted about 15 mins, ours together about the same length of time. I watched the light as we ate dinner.  Solid white, very bright, and below the cloud layer.  Eventually it just winked out.;44.3174816901409;-78.2840647887323
