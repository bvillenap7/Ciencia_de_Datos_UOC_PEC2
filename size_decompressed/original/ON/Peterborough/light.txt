Strange orange lights in Peterborough, Ontario;2012-07-01 21:45:00;10 minutes;Strange orange lights in Peterborough, Ontario Our family went down to Little Lake to enjoy the Canada Day festivities.  We were listening to the music and waiting for the fire works to start.  The sky was clear except for the odd streak of cloud to the west. The sun was setting but it was still quite light out.  We were sitting on the south side of the lake facing north.  My husband was looking into the sky when i looked up to see what he was staring at. There was a radio tower in the distance.  A large bright orange light appeared out of nowhere behind it. The large orange light traveled south east in a straight line for quite a distance then completely disappeared.  This happened 3 times in total. Each time the light appeared in the approximately the same spot, traveled the same route and disappeared without a trace.  We wondered if this was the same light repeating its actions or three lights following sequence.  The bright orange light stayed consistent in color and brightness.;44.3174816901409;-78.2840647887323
Pulsating light;2012-07-02 03:40:00;30 seconds;I observed a pulsating light north of my location at approx a 50degree angle.  The object was moving in an easterly direction at a very slow speed.   The light pulsated for about 30 seconds from the time I first observed it.   When the light disappeared I shielded my eyes from the artificial light in the area and there were no signs of the light.   I do not believe it was either a plane or helicopter.;44.3174816901409;-78.2840647887323
Silent Orange Lights over Peterborough.;2013-08-24 23:55:00;45 seconds;Silent Orange Lights over Peterborough While leaving work, I noticed two orange lights in the sky.  They were a fair size which told me they were relatively close.  The odd thing was, they made no sound that I could hear.  I saw these two lights for about 45 seconds, then they disappeared behind a tree.;44.3174816901409;-78.2840647887323
BRIGHT white light low in the sky.;2013-09-15 20:40:00;45 minutes;BRIGHT white light low in the sky. While at work one night I took a glance out the window and I noticed a very bright white light fairly low in the sky.  The light was in the Western sky.  It seemed to be constant (not flickering) or anything.  I pointed it to a fellow coworker and they said it was probably a satellite.  It was so bright and 4 times the size of the other stars in the sky.  I have seen a satellite before, and this was NOT a satellite, however I do not know what it was. I continued to watch it off and on as I was at work.  It didnâ€™t seem to move at all.  It was a very clear night and you could see a few stars, but this was nothing like I have seen before. It was so bright.  Between the time I noticed it and the last time I looked out approximately 40 minutes had past.  The last time I looked out it was gone (at 2130). It reappeared the following night around the same time, and at the same spot.  This time it was still there when I left work at 2230 but it had moved further down the road, more in the south, over trees in the far distance.  I went down the road and tried to take a few pictures and a couple of videos with my cell phone but it was hard to capture as there was no zoom on my phone for the video.  It appeared to slightly change shape as I watched it.  I watched it for a good 10 minutes, and went home. The area I work in is towards the outskirts of town in a rural area.  I have not seen this again.;44.3174816901409;-78.2840647887323

It stayed hovering for 15 min with flashing red green and yellow light.  We thought it must have been a star but it eventually moved out of sight, with no noise.
