Small white dots in sky.;2005-06-07 13:00:00;30 min;Small white dots in sky. A friend and I were sitting on her porch when she said, what is that.  I looked up and saw it as well.  They were little circular dots in the sky.  They were white in colour.  They were sometimes still, and some times moveing.  There must have been at least 5 or 6 of them.  It was mid day when I saw them, so it was quite bright. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.3174816901409;-78.2840647887323
