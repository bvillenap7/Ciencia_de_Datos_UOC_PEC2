Silver sphere like crafts seen over northern skies of Peterborough;2006-03-17 13:30:00;5 minutes;Silver sphere like crafts seen over northern skies of Peterborough While riding public transit I spotted a silver sphere like craft moving quickly then slowing right down in skies north of Peterborough. My roommate who was also a witness didn't see what I was talking about at first until one of the objects gave off a bright reflection. I then spotted another similar craft further towards the horizon. We got off the bus at the 7/11 on lansdowne street west to get a better look. The closest object at this time appeared to be hovering then a change in its reflection (brighter) then it started moving towards the west horizon very quickly. We heard no noise, saw no lights. Perhaps weather balloons but I don't believe they can stop in mid air like these objects did. All to strange for me, this is not the first time I have seen stange craft in this region of ontario either.;44.3174816901409;-78.2840647887323
