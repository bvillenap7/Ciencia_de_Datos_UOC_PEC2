I was fixed on what I was witnessing and I got an overwhelming sense of respect for the craft but no fear at all. I knew I couldn't chance looking away to grab my cellphone nor was it really even a thought when in this transe-like state. The disk had no windows or bulbous top portion.. but it did rotate in a counter clock-wise. All of a sudden the disk zipped off to the left and on a dime suddenly went the opposite direction and upward - leaving behind it a light trail that I could only describe as greeny blue like a strip of Northern Light affect with laser precision.  I dont remember the! last 200 ft of my walk home nor recalled the event for a few days.. the more I recall it the more I remember what happened that very night. There was no sound, no wind, no lights on this craft and it felt like it knew I was there but didn't expect anyone to be out and about at that time.;44.3174816901409;-78.2840647887323
