GARGATUAN EXLPOSION IN THE SKY EMITS BRILLIANT BLINDING LIGHT AND EARTHQUAKE LIKE TREMORS;2003-10-01 02:00:00;15-30 seconds;GARGATUAN EXLPOSION IN THE SKY EMITS BRILLIANT BLINDING LIGHT AND EARTHQUAKE LIKE TREMORS It was about two in the morning when I was just getting out of my car to head back into my apartment.  All of the sudden there was a massive explosion in the sky.  The sky filled with brilliant white light.  The entire sky in all directions was steadily and heavily illuminated.  It was brighter than daytime, so bright I could barely see.  A ground rumbling explosion also accompanied the light flash at the same time.  The explosion sound, vibrations and the flash all occurred at the exact same time and persisted and stopped at the same time.  This lasted from anywhere from at least 15 seconds to 30 seconds.  The ground shook so violently that I could barely stand up and I almost was thrown to the ground as I tried to run for cover because I thought it was a bomb going off or something. After the event ceased many car alarms where going off and the electric had gone out throughout the neighborhood.  It was a clear night if I recall and there was not any thunderstorm activity.  I can not remember if it was exactly the end of September or the beginning of October, but it was sometime not to long before the Canadian Thanksgiving.  Many people witnessed this including my girlfriend and landlord.  My ears rang and my vision was blurry for a brief time after this occurrence. I have endured many intense and destructive thunderstorms and I can at least tell you that this was not thunder, lighting, or a meteor and if it was and earthquake (which it did feel like), then what was the explosion?  If anyone else witnessed this or knows anything about this please report it to the NUFORC so more information can be gathered about this instance.;44.3174816901409;-78.2840647887323
