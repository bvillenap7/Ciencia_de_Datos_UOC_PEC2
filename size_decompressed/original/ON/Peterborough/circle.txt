2 bright lights going south very high and fast and appearing to go up and out of sight.;2008-05-24 02:35:00;3 to 5 min;2 bright lights going south very high and fast and appearing to go up and out of sight. I was sitting on the south side of my house at the time shown. The sky was clear and the moon was out. I was looking south toward the moon and a bright star on its lsft. I noticed 2 lights to the right of the moon moving fast in a south direction. The light in front was bright and the other a little dimmer. The size of the lights were alittle larger than the brightest star. The lights were very sharp and clear. They were whitish in color. The dimmer light appeared to follow the brighter one. The distance between the lights would be about an inch if i held my hand out and covered the lights with my fingers. They were moving very fast and after 3 min started to fade out and went out of sight.I watched and never saw them again.;44.3174816901409;-78.2840647887323
2 Orange Lights moving through sky;2015-12-31 23:45:00;4 minutes;2 Orange Lights moving through sky After hearing your report on Coast to Coast of the orange lights seen in Seattle, I then looked at the video on your website and was stunned to see the exact same thing my husband and I saw. On this past New Years Eve at 11:45 pm, I was in my bedroom and saw out the window (we have a really high view above the city) an orange light moving across the sky.  At first it looked a bit like a diamond shape but then it was clearly an orange Orb shape moving from the NW to the E.  I called out for my husband who ran up to the kitchen to look out the window but he didnâ€™t see it.  Within a minute he started calling my name to come look and I ran down to the kitchen and another orange Orb was moving from the same starting point in the same direction. We went outside to listen for sounds of an engine and heard only silence, also there were no other lights on these things, just round orange lights moving across the sky but a little faster than what was seen in the video on your website.;44.3174816901409;-78.2840647887323
