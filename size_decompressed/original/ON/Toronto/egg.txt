It had lights that were not flashing It was 3:00 o clock and I was in my grandpas car on the highway when I looked up and saw something doing zigzags in the sky it had lights on it. I though it was a plane but then I though Why would a plane have lights on at three o clock and if it did they would be flashing which they weren't and no plane I know could do zig zags.After a minute or two it just stopped and rushed of and vanished. I didn't tell any one because my family never belives me.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Egg shaped UFO sighted over Toronto and Barrie Ontario on Saturday, September 19, 2009 at 1943 hours;2009-09-19 19:43:00;5 - 6 seconds;Egg shaped UFO sighted over Toronto and Barrie Ontario on Saturday, September 19, 2009 at 1943 hours While traveling southbound on Islington Avenue south of Hwy 7 at 19:43 hours on Saturday, September 19, 2009 my son pointed out a light in the sky that was moving directly vertically over the skies of Toronto.  I looked in the direction that my son was pointing and also clearly saw the object.  The object was an egg shaped light that emitted streams of light from the bottom which radiated out of the bottom in the shape of a cone.  Picture a egg shaped flood light shining down, that was the image we were watching going up.  My son and I had the object in our sights for about 5 to seconds and then it just kept going until we couldnâ€™t see it any longer.  I immediately called the A Channel newsroom to report the sighting.  I reported the sighting and inquired whether they had any other reports of such a sighting over the city of Toronto to which I was advised that they received reports of an identical object being seen over the city of Barrie.  This is our accou! nt of the sighting of Saturday, September 19, 2009 at 1943 hours.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
