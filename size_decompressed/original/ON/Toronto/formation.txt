I thought it was odd to be able to see satellites so clearly in the city as I had so easily in the countryside. As the three lights travelled across the sky, they suddenly broke up and the one on the bottom crossed over at a right angle and suddenly sped off between the two others at tremendous speed. The other two changed their direction to follow. In a matter of seconds, the three lights had chased each other from my view.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

I noticed a brownish formation of three objects starting from the north going in a southly direction at a very fast pace.  The movement of these objects seemed like a flock or birds but it accured to me that it could not be as they were traveling way to fast across the sky.   They seemed to move in front and back of each other till they disappered in less than 5 the most 6 seconds.  They object were wider apart at the begining and moved closer to each other as they travelled south.  Almost a brownish orange in colour not to bright but noticeably with the eye with little strain.   I was amazed of how fast it was travelling and if i had to pick the exact location I would have to say it travelled between the Orion and Tarus consetallion.   Hope someone could shed some light to what I saw! Ther where no sounds or aircrafts in the area ((NUFORC Note:  If the sky was dark at the time of the sighting, as I suspect it must have been, it is possible that the witness may have observed three birds, probably migratory birds, flying rapidly across the sky.  I, too, have been startled, momentarily, when first witnessing birds flying rapidly through the night sky.  The lighter colored feathers reflect illumination from the ground, giving an observer on the ground the impression that a peculiar object is streaking across the sky, when in fact, the birds may be much closer than the witness perceives to be the case.  That is just a guess, a possible explanation for the sighting.  We may well be wrong about the nature of the event.  PD));43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Light formations, Toronto;2005-04-05 22:20:00;15M;Light formations, Toronto Formations of lights flying across the sky in Toronto  Visibility: clear sky, but poor visibility due to downtown light pollution.  The first one was around 10.20PM and it was a pattern like a large swept-back wing, without a fuselage. The pattern was symetrical and I thought it looked like an advertising plane with lights on the wing. Only problem was that it was too large and silent. Only the single points of light in formation were visible.  Then around 10.30-10.35 there was a skalene triangle formation of 3 lights flying across the sky in a southward direction. They looked like fighter jets in formation from the apparent speed and distance. The span of the formation was about 1 inch at arms lenth.  There was some other normal air traffic, but on the aircraft you could make out multiple lights as well as the body of the plane. The light formations observed were white and single points.  I then saw a linear formation of 3 lights head north. A little while later a single light head south. That was the last one I saw.  All the lights were too far apart to be a single airplane, although they kept perfect formation. Straight line travel,  no turns that I saw. From the way they faded when heading toward the horizon I would guess they were quite high. Too fast for a satelite, plus this was downtown and a satelite would be too dim. I estimate they were traveling 30 degrees of arc in 5 second when overhead. ((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
3 amber lights;2005-05-30 04:00:00;12-15 secs;3 amber lights May 30th 2005, about 4:00am eastern time  	I was standing at my window as I had been doing for several nights:  reading material on physics and chemistry from my school texts and those I had printed from Wikipedia.  The lights were out and I was using 2 candles to light the pages:  It’s a long story.  My window is on the 9th floor facing East ward, overlooking downtown Toronto from the West.  	I took a cigarette out of the package beside me on the window sill, pickup up the lighter and looked up and directly out of the window.  At that moment I was struck with the fact that there were 2 objects in the sky which I had never seen before (and trust me, I look out this window several times per day and night).  The only words I could use to describe the situation at the time were of a questionable nature.  	The 2 objects were holding position in formation.  One was slightly higher than the other and only a nudge off to the left.  They were bright amber in color and luminescent.  At first they looked like gigantic stars.  It soon became clear when, after sitting still for approximately 4 seconds, both of them darted off to the right with incredible speed and acceleration.  Without slowing down or accelerating, they immediately stopped and went in the opposite direction as they were joined by a 3rd from across the lake.  All 3 objects maintained a delta formation that was rotating slightly as they flew at the speed of mach 30 off to the North and out of sight.  The entire sighting lasted approximately 12-15 seconds, in which time they covered a distance of no less than 85km.  	The objects were luminescent spheres, travelling at mach 30 or beyond, in perfect delta and parallel formations.  They were within the atmosphere, not higher than 1km above ground level.  They switched directions and appeared to have the ability to accelerate and decelerate almost instantaneously.  	I’ve run through the list of all possible explanations and this incident seems to defy every explanation.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Four lights converging together, then spread out, then converge to the centre again.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights??  PD));2006-11-06 21:00:00;30-45 min;Four lights converging together, then spread out, then converge to the centre again.  Exact pattern repeated over and over. Four hazy white lights, repeatedly converging together in the centre, then moving out separately.  The four lights were equally spaced out to make a diamond or square.  They all moved clockwise about 45 degrees and converged back to the middle.  It was precisely the same pattern over and over.  A very rhythmic movement. We were on Highway 401 and saw it just over the trees, out the passenger side windows for quite some time while we drove. Eventually it was behind us, and became difficult to see due to the headlights of the oncoming traffic. ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights??  Time is approximate.

Comercial Pilots' report to Toronto ATC of unknown fast flying formation, as heard by me on airband radio;2011-05-07 21:11:00;10 minutes;Comercial Pilots' report to Toronto ATC of unknown fast flying formation, as heard by me on airband radio This is not a personal sighting, but a report of a sighting between Toronto Centre ATC (133.300 Mhz AM)  and an Air Transport Pilot (Jazz 951?) as heard by me on Airband radio, while driving north on Hwy 400 in Toronto. Only the Pilots side of the transmision was heard. Missed the inital pilots report, but continued:  Pilot:  I am a hunter and I can tell you they looked like group of ducks- but ducks flying at 25.1 ? (25,100 feet AGL) It was pretty fast, whatever it was ! I know this will sound wierd, but I've seen jets flying out of Cold Lake(Alberta) and it did'nt look like that  Pilots signal goes out of range and no longer heard. Nature of conversation in quotes is from my brief notes taken while driving and memory (8 minutes before writing this report). I have no doubt that the pilot's tone of voice was one of consern and wonder and he seemed very baffled about not being able to identifying a strange looking object formation that flew very quickly by him at slightly higher elevation. He announced he was at 24,000 feet just before I lost his signal. ATC could not identify it either, judging by pilot respones. This should not be difficult to research/confirm with Toronto Centre ATC. (133.300 Sector)  Mhz;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Multiple spherical objects fly in silent formation over Toronto, Ontario Canada.;2011-05-07 21:30:00;30 seconds;Multiple spherical objects fly in silent formation over Toronto, Ontario Canada. Location Toronto, Ontario Canada  Date 05/07/11  Time: Approx 9:30pm EDT  Exact Geographic Co ordinance- 43° 41' 28.76 N  79° 30' 33.56 W  Duration of sighting: Approx 30 seconds   At around 9:30pm local time on May 7, 2011, I headed outside of my apartment building to take my dog outside for his nightly run.  The sky was clear and the weather was mild and calm with absolutely no wind.   Upon looking southwards I noticed a large object moving in the sky at an altitude of roughly 5,000ft.  It was arc shaped and appeared to be made up of individual spherical objects (really tough to say how many, but I would estimate at least 10) flying together in perfect formation.   The object was slightly smaller than a Boeing 737 aircraft, and had no lights on it.  The object crossed the sky in a SW to NW direction at a relatively quick pace maintaining the arc formation without changing shape.  It appeared to be moving slower than a traditional airplane.  The object had no lights and made absolutely no sounds as it passed overhead.  The moonlight reflected off of the object giving it a greyish appearance but it was difficult to make out any specific physical details of the craft.   About 20 seconds after first spotting the object cross the sky it came to a complete stop but remained in the arc formation.  It hovered in place for around 2 seconds.  The objects then began to “swirl” around each other, taking on a more luminous white glow but were not brightly lit.  They “swirled” around each other in an apparently random pattern for about 3-5 seconds and then shot straight up into the sky and disappeared.   Again, there was no sound from the object at all. The total duration of the sighting lasted around 30 seconds.   This is the first sighting I have ever seen in Southern Ontario.  I am from New Brunswick, Canada and have seen UFO’s there when I was very young but nothing has ever looked like what I saw on May 7th.   Unfortunately I did not have my camera on me at the time to get a picture of this event.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Orange shape with 2-3 perfect rectangular small black blocks inside the shape looking like windows;2014-05-16 03:00:00;15 seconds;orange shape with 2-3 perfect rectangular small black blocks inside the shape looking like windows May 16th, 2014, 3am (north/west on the 34th floor condo over viewing etobicoke from my balcony) my girl friend went on the balcony to have a smoke.  She called me right away to look at something “weird/strange”.   I come out and saw this orange oval/circle shape with perfect 2-3 rectangular small black blocks inside the shape looking like windows but there was no light/reflection/glare or anything shiny...It was cloudy and the clouds were moving fast until it covered the object and it just disappeared. My girl friend concluded it must have been the moon and somehow sun/city lights + clouds were just reflecting onto it causing it to look orange/strange…. Since it was cloudy and could not confirm the moon’s located I waited another day and it was full moon and the moon was much much higher and all the way to WEST. I showed my girl friend the moon the next day and we concluded immediately that it was not the moon... nor have I/we ever seen an orange moon!;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
