intense flashing lights, knocked off our chairs;1974-09-07 22:30:00;secconds;intense flashing lights, knocked off our chairs Sitting in a lawn chair with a good friend of mine in the evening of September 1974. We were looking at the sky and winding our evening down. Without a warning, no noise, no sightings. Intensly bright flashing white lights passed over us with incredable speed. We were both knocked backwards off our lawn chairs.  Ther were 5 flashes in total but to this day I'm not to sure if it was the shock of seeing lights so amazingly bright or if it was as if we were the only things in the area that got caught up in its wake as it passed by us so fast. We did tell some friends but after the response we got we decided not to share this incident any longer with any one else. The lights seemed to start off in the distance with only one flash. We both started to ask if the other had seen it. Before we knew it or could even finnish asking the other if he had seen it ,the light was above us and flashing with such intense brightness. To this day I am amazed at what I saw and will never forget it ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

Lout jet noise heard in Toronto - but no jet.;2003-04-15 04:55:00;Less than 1 minute;Lout jet noise heard in Toronto - but no jet. At 4:55am, it sounded like a 747 about to hit our building or a plane fly directly overhead. We called the Greater Toronto Airport Authority at Pearson International Airport about the noise we heard. They got back to us roughly at 11am and said they don't know what it was since there was no planes flying that low during that time.  The noise was so terrifying, that it felt like a dream, because we thought we were about to die because the noise was so close. We have never, and especially I, never experienced that kind of noise that close before. Less than 24 hours of the incident, there is not explaination.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

The object had no flashing lights or sound of any kind. I was not certain that it was an object moving but confirmed what i was seeing with very close attention. The object seemed like a aiplane 2 connected airplane wings with no body. There was no sound as it moved through the sky. I do not and still do not belive the existence of flying saucers however I do believe this to be an unidenfied flying object. There was no way anyone else would have noticed if they were not looking at the sky with particular attention to see something ie a shooting star, which I was. Then there it was. SOMETHING was moving through the sky. At first I thought it might be a cloud but it moving a faster rate of speed than clouds move. There were no identifible lights of any kind.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
series of lights moving north over Toronto;2003-07-19 23:50:00;seconds;series of lights moving north over Toronto 3 people, myself included, sitting in our backyard. We saw a line of 4 lights moving very quickly through the night sky, heading north. Beside them, but with certainly enough distance so as to not be attached to these four lights, another cluster of three lights, possibly in a triangle formation. They simply headed north and out of our view. Writing this now, I realize that it could easily sound like a plane. But having lived in a major city for 20 years, watching planes fly over constantly, I can only say that this was not a plane. It moved much faster than a plane. It was a series of all white lights, and it was accompanied by another series of lights.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Fast glowing moving object does 90 degree turn at night.;2004-05-14 23:00:00;1;Fast glowing moving object does 90 degree turn at night. Out having a smoke ejoying the night sky. I was facing south south west. When a bright object came into view from the east. It made its way west then made a sharp 90 degree turn south.  Not sure how high it was or how fast it was traveling. I'm suprised I was able to see it. I accutally had to think again if I did see it. There are no wires or trees in the area to reflect local traffic lights. It was slim and long. Not sure if it was a cirgar type object. Had a white glow to it.  It made no noise and if I had to judge the speed. It was fast. And when it made it's turn it did not even stop or slow down. Also when it turned not sure if it bent while making the turn or if it just moved as one.  If it did show up on a radar. As there is an international airport near by. I'd think it would have just shown up as a blip if that.  I would have easily dismised this as a meteor except when it turned.  I dont drink. I dont wear glasses. I take no medications.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Streaks of Light close to the ground, followed by odd sensations;2005-06-01 13:50:00;2 seconds;Streaks of Light close to the ground, followed by odd sensations I enjoy to take walks late at night as excercise, from 1am to 3am--having coffee and smoking while walking through the side streets.  On one of the nights (yesterday), I was gazing far off into the night sky observing the constellations when I saw a streak of light, akin to a shooting star--though it appeared as if the light source came from behind a cloud. It looked as if whatever was zooming at high speed behind the cloud had casted its light onto the cloud--something which a shooting star is unlikely to do.  I felt an odd sensation on the top of my head , almost like goosebumps or static electricity. I felt the need to run my fingers through my hair to make the feeling go away. I found this as odd, but passed it off as only a shooting star.  However, the night after (tonight) I experienced something similar to the night before--only much closer...while walking along a sidestreet before getting to my home, I thought i heard an animal behind me, so i turned my head to take a cursory glance almost half a kilometre away and a quarter kilometre above myself I saw a flash of light streaking across the sky horizontally, as if a firecracker went off vibrant white, almost blinding. I could hear a hiss and a crackle (like a vinyl record player makes).  And again, that odd senstation occured--a static feeling on the top of my head followed by vibrations down throughout--stopping around my knees.  Though what is strikingly odd is how close it was to the ground and to myself.  I could hear it as well, so there is no mistaking the streak of light coming from within the earth's atmosphere. During my 3 years of walking during the night I have never seen anything like this--not to mention twice during two nights. I have seen a shooting star before several years ago, and I know enough to know that there must be another explanation for this. However, the sensations that have occured directly after the flashes were not caused by my inner body, as I have never felt this particular way ever before.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
two blinding lights over toronto;2006-07-29 12:47:00;5 min;two blinding lights over toronto I was sitting on my balcony just watching the stars when suddenly out of nowhere 2 blinding lights appeared. At first I thought they were just planes seeing as I live near an airport but after watching them I saw they were hovering in one spot but yet they moved up and down. About 5 mins passed and they were still in the same spots side by side. Then as quick as they appeared they shot across the sky and then straight up and were gone.

Color changing bright light spotted over downtown Toronto.;2007-04-15 22:00:00;30mins;Color changing bright light spotted over downtown Toronto I was standing on the balcony of my friend’s apartment (9th floor) in downtown Toronto looking north-west when I noticed what at first appeared to be a very bright star.  As I continued to observe the light I noticed that it kept changing color from blue to red to white.   At first I thought that it was an airplane as there was some air traffic in the distance.  But as time went by it appeared as though the light stood still while the air traffic passed by at a higher altitude.   After staying in one spot for almost 30 minutes (at least from when I began observing it) it suddenly began to climb in altitude and then it vanished.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Craft traveling from east to west in Toronto;2008-04-02 02:25:00;few seconds;Craft traveling from east to west in Toronto At 2: 20 am,  April 2,  I went to the dinning room and looked at the sky, I saw suddenly a craft in the sky flying under the clouds, although at that hour you don’t see airplanes in Toronto.  I lived in a 20 floor from where I am able to see airplanes coming from the island airport, and also I have visibility to see airplanes going to Pearson Airport but never at that hour.   Defining the shape of the object I saw is difficult, due to fact that first appeared as it was an airplane by its distance but when it approached west, in a fast manner, just seconds, turn on even more lights and turn on a big beam light towards up the sky.  The beam light seems as it was coming from the back of the craft, very impressively.  The lights were mainly white.  The craft traveled from east to west.  I wonder what I saw.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
