White glowing Cigar shapped object (not moving).;1986-06-06 13:00:00;2 minutes;White glowing Cigar shaped object (not moving). This happened when me and my father were driving eastbound on the 401, I was around 16 at the time. I looked up and seen what looked like a fluorescent tube in the sky, it was a clear sky, sun shining and I thought to myself at first a blimb reflecting the sun's rays. I said to my dad what the hell is that? he looked and couldn't figure it out.  It wasn't a blimb it was very high in the sky, looked like a few miles which would have made the object 100-200 feet in length just glowing like a white tube. It didn't seem to be moving, I begged for my father to pull over so we could watch it but he didn't want to pull over on the highways express lanes so, I could only watch for like 2 minutes. I'll never forget it and thought to myself if anyone else seen this. I was shocked to discover last year how many people on this  planet that have seen similar craft of this type. I thought I was alone, man was I wrong. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

I was driving on Hwy 35 just outside of Lindsay, Ontario when I spotted the object about 45 degrees from the horizon in the eastern sky at very close range. It was about the size of a blimp, just a little smaller and a little thinner. It was metallic grey and there were no windows. I would have never noticed it except there was lightning that went from the ground up which caught my eye. Then there was another burst of lightning, again from the ground up when I saw that it was going towards this object. It was a grey cloudy drizzling day and the object was halfway hidden by a cloud. This was strange because clouds thick enough to hide an object at so close a range could not do so. It was as if the object was deliberately hiding from view behind a cloud that could not be there. What was even more strange was I felt my mind go sort of foggy and I was having difficulty hanging on to the image and the memory only second after I saw it. A friend told me afterwards that other UFO sightings had been reported in Peterborough (a near by town) that same afternoon. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Cigar shaped object seen in Toronto, showed great speed , and ability to hover;2007-04-10 14:00:00;10 minutes;Cigar shaped object seen in Toronto, showed great speed , and ability to hover I live in Toronoto. My apartment faces the lake looking into Hamilton. At about 2:00 pm, I was going for a smoke out on the balcony. I heard the people from the apartment above comment on something in the sky, it took me a minute to spot it myself. The object was over Lake Ontario. at first it looked like a ball of haze with a dark nucleus in the center. I whent to get the binoculars, I came back to see in better deatil, but it had move maybe 2 kilometers across the lake to the right. When I cought to the object with the binoculars, I could rule out anything that I've seen in the sky before. I watched it for about a minute, I guess it could have been a disc, but to me it look more like a pen. It had a shiny silver top and a black bottom. I watched for another couple minutes, it didn't move. Then finnaly, it slowly started into the clouds and disappeared, and I never saw it again.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
March 30th  07 Maryland craft sighting spotted in Toronto on May 29th 07;2007-05-29 22:27:00;3 minutes;March 30th  07 Maryland craft sighting spotted in Toronto on May 29th 07 On the night of May 29th I was outside on my driveway looking up toward the stars, I was staring at the big dipper long enough to hurt my neck. I was holding my cell phone and glanced down to check the time because I've noticed satellites pass by at the same times every night. I checked once, time was 22:26, I check again and it changed to 22:27. I look up and see a craft hover above me passing over a large tree across the street, it was flying on an angle and the craft looked like a tongue ring barbell including the balls on both ends. I watched it mentally for no more than ten seconds, but when I immediately glanced at my cell again the time had changed to 22:30. I had roughly lost three minutes in a span of ten seconds. Two nights ago I checked this website and came across the report from March 30 2007 from Maryland. Roughly two months later I witnessed the same craft in Toronto. Through out the years I have seen many strange lights in the sky do spectacular things, but when I was able to connect my sighting to the previous one in Maryland it completely blew me away. Just thought I'd share my experience.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
A cigar shaped object that made no sound, had two glowing red circular lights at the bottom, flying in a North direction.;2010-04-06 23:30:00;00:30;A cigar shaped object that made no sound, had two glowing red circular lights at the bottom, flying in a North direction. I looked up while leaving my apartment building, I saw a plane in the distance as I usually do, however, what i saw was what I believe to be a cigar shaped object. There were two small circles. Both were red. They looked a lot like what a ring lite on a camera would look like except with the middle part filled in so that there is only a small ring of black. I thought it could be a helicopter, but I'm right near a lot of hospitals so i know what the helicopters look like, and it had no flashing lights on it that would signify it was such. It also made absolutely no sound. The craft was moving what appeared to be a straight path, however, the lights were not aligned straight, they were diagonal to each other and moving straight. There was also a helicopter in the vicinity passing nearby so I knew it couldn't be one. I have never seen any flight vehicle fly in that path either so it felt out of place. It flew at a steady pace. Id say the speed was equivalent ! to seeing a low flying Cessna it was fast, but not supersonic. I didn't see where it went as I was in a hurry and did not at the time realize what I had seen. The thing that stuck out was the lights, they were odd. I will email image files shortly;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Imagine for a moment, as if the pattern of a tiger’s stripes was energetically oscillating at an extremely fast rate.;2016-08-28 22:00:00;5 seconds;Two UFO / UAP Sightings North Of Toronto, Canada — Sunday, Aug 28, 2016. Did anyone else have a sighting in Toronto, Sunday night between 10-10:30PM?   Approximately 10PM EST, Sunday August 28, 2016, over Newmarket, north of Toronto, Canada, two of us were sitting in the backyard facing East (see the photo below where the sun is rising the next morning with StarTracker Lite App superimposed to show the sky from Sunday night). Traveling from North to South (left to right in the picture above) across the eastern sky at a speed that was like a shooting star was a craft that was oval in appearance, seemingly wide like a plane, at a height approximating what a commercial jet would be flying overhead. From our sitting position on the backyard deck, it passed slightly above the trees as it sped South for a count of “1 and 2 and…” then continued with its view obstructed by the trees in a slightly wider field of view than the photo above.  Initially we asked ourselves if this could be a meteorite but having already seen two a little earlier, it was clearly uncharacteristic of a meteorite. It was oval as if it might have wings but they were not perceptible wings.  It was more like an energy pulse extending to each side like wings.  It appeared as a quickly pulsating, oscillation with long, oval arch to each side.  The rapid pulsing to each side of its center was extremely fast. Imagine for a moment, as if the pattern of a tiger’s stripes was energetically oscillating at an extremely fast rate.  That is how it appeared to me, though to Alison sitting beside me, it was more like a subdued yet oval light swishing across the sky in a dark halo surrounding it. Unlike the meteorite that arched down from the sky towards the horizon like the two meteorites that we witnessed earlier, this UAP flew straight across the sky at a speed that is comparable to a meteorite.  The energy was electric.  The sky was the clearest we have seen all summer. Approximately 30-minutes later, at 10:32pm, we saw exactly the same phenomenon in the same exact line of vision, but this time traveling from South to North.  Notably, it was moving approximately at half the speed of the original sighting for a count of “1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and…” then the trees obstructed our view.  At that speed, it was speeding much faster than a jet fighter would across the sky.  There was no sound at all. Again, there was an electric, energetic feel to the energy filling the air, possibly our own excitement from what we saw. This is the sky photographed on my iPhone 5s taken immediately after.  Though the phone was in my hand, the craft moved much too quickly to take a shot. I believe these are the solar systems and stars that were visible, though I am not 100% certain of their exact placement, according to the StarTracker Lite App on my phone.  Very grainy shot, but it offers perspective of where we were sitting and what we saw pass across our field of view. The next morning at approximately 7:30am I went outside to photograph the sun rising in the exact same spot we witnessed the sighting Sunday night, to have a clear perspective of where we had witnessed the UAPs for this report.  Upon downloading the images to my computer, one of the shots taken had a bright spot above the sun. When enlarged, two objects are revealed.  What is particularly interesting is that the seeming light source is at the top, north side of the spheres and they exhibit a shadow to the bottom south side. While I have won awards for my photography and work in television, I am not an expert with Photoshop nor do I have proper tools for analysis.  My question to the readers out there:  Is this image typical of lens flair?  Is it something else that is naturally explainable?   Or, is this a genuine capture of an Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon or UFO?  That daylight photo aside, what we saw Sunday evening took our breath away.  Never before have I seen anything like that or even read about craft resembling what we saw.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
