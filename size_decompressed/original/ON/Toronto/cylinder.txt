Black cylinder object;2001-06-15 15:30:00;5:00min;Black cylinder object I was in the backyard of my friends house.It was overcast skies and could see that it was about to rain.There was 6 of us in total.three of my friends started to bring the radio and speakers back into the house. I remember looking up at the sky and seeing seagulls. But there was a black cylynder shaped object moving against the wind.it wasnt very big,(like the size of a fridge)it could'nt of been more than 200ft up.There was no sound and it moved slow.I shouted to my friend and yelled what ((text deleted)) is that! Two of my friends saw it too and could'nt explain it. the other day at work a co-worker and I were talking about Ufo's, I mentioned what we saw and he told me that other people have seen the same thing.It gave me a chill.

While driving north on the DVP at 1:35pm and we looked up in the sky and saw a white cylindrical object flying east.;2003-08-30 13:35:00;10 Seconds;While driving north on the DVP at 1:35pm and we looked up in the sky and saw a white cylindrical object flying east. We were driving North on the DVP (around Lawrence Ave) at 1:35pm and we looked up in the sky and saw a white cylindrical object flying east. It had NO wings at all.  I have never seen anything like it ever in my life.  The object had no lights that we could see.  It wasn't reflecting any sun that I could see.  It was a sunny day outside and it was in the daylight...I hope other people see it and report.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
We both saw it at the same time.;2008-03-23 02:00:00;3-4 minutes;We both saw it at the same time. My wife and I were driving home from Sudbury to Toronto. My wife was at the wheel while I tried to get some sleep in the passenger seat on the drive home. About 40 minutes into the drive, my wife woke me, and told me to look to my right (westward)and up. Since we had been admiring the full moon earlier, and how clear it was, I got somewhat irritated and refused. She pulled over to the shoulder got out of the car, came to the passenger side opened the door and told me to look again. Off to the southwest and under the full moon we saw a gold/green shinny cylinder about the size of a city bus hovering over the tree tops. No noise, no movement. No windows. Just hovering about 500 metres from us. At first I thought the Northen Lights were way too low in the sky and my wife agreed, and mentioned that the shape and non-movement could not make this the Northen Lights. The gold/ green sheen flowed in a rhythmic motion from front to back. I looked around to see if any other motorists would stop to see what we were looking at. No-one else was on the road at that hour. My wife said Advertizing Balloon? I grabbed a handfull of road shoulder gravel and one by one threw them to see if I could hit the balloon. It was too far to hit. We stood there for about 4 minutes looking up, and out at the highway to see if other motorists would also stop. Not a single car passed nothbound or south. With no noise, the cylinder moved south west for about 200 metres at slow speed and at the same altitude, then flew straight up at a fantastic speed and disappeared into the distance. We stood there for another 4 or 5 minutes. Looking up, and to the direction where we had originally seen the object. We had a good deal of speculation and commenting on what we had just seen. We are both sensible people. Non-drug users. Responsible professionals in our job fields. Yet nothing in our minds can make any reason of what we saw. I had to wait until she got to bed before I could find this web site and relay this to you. My wife wants this to become a non-event, or people will thing we're crazy. I may be crazy she may be crazy but there is NO WAY we could be crazy at the same time.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Really really bizarre;2013-06-05 01:00:00;1 hour;Really really bizarre So from our bedroom window we saw a bright flashing light. We first thought it was a helicopter.  It was making a strange sound like a subwoofer. We looked out the window and saw an object flying at an eerie pace.  Unlike anything we had ever seen. It had many different flashing lights.  Again we thought it was a helicopter but it had no propellars. Also helicopters don't move like this.  After A minute or so it disappeared behind a few trees.  After this we ventured to the roof top where we saw 3 of the same craft in the distance.  They looked like airplanes but did not move like airplanes. They also hovered for extended periods of time and were going back and forth and up and down over the Mississauga area of toronto. They also became blindingly bright when they seemed to be turning. They are still flying around but it became too cold and we came inside. From our bed we heard the noise again and went to the window to see the same craft travelling east before falling out of sight.

Downtown Toronto, ONTARIO, Canada  12:08am -  For a distance that I would say is no more than 6-inches across the sky, tracking in a linear direction of a West to East direction but in the sky north of Avenue and Davenport Rd roof top location, we noticed a round, thick white light turning on and off to a rhythm of “on” for a count of 1 and 2 and, “off” 3 and 4 and, “on” 5 and 6 and 7 and off 8 and 9 and for a total of 5 “on” lights all together.  What is totally strange for me is that at 3 “on”s   I flashed on my green starlight laser and when I flashed it through the dark from 3 black 4 black and 5 it turned off but seemed to move faster for a moment and out of sight.  The size of the light was bigger than a commercial jet’s frontal high beam light coming towards someone, yet was lit from underneath, not in the forward direction.  Also, the light beneath it was somewhat subdued and not as bright as the planes in the distance flashing as they moved off in all directions.  In terms of size, from my rooftop it seemed ! to measure about 3mm in the sky above.  That it seemingly immediately reacted to my laser when I flashed at it was outstanding. 12:24am - Travelling from NW towards the moon in a SE direction (north of Avenue and Davenport again) was a cylinder shaped object tumbling or spinning in a clock-wise direction in almost a slow motion-like momentum, much like one would expect to see in space, yet close enough for us to see it with our naked eyes even though it was night, traveling within a halo of very soft, subtle and subdued light.  The object seemed to be illumined with a subdued, washed-out amber and green light.  It looked like the cylinder was a 4:1 ratio of length to width. In the sky it measured approximately 5mm and with the halo closer to 7mm in diameter.  It was lower than the clouds but higher than the jets flying east, taking off from the airport.  I pointed my green laser and could see the object get hit from the beam a number of times, much like I could see the laser hit the side of a building in the distance with a focused dot.  The cylinder’s surface seemed like it was a reflective surface judgi! ng by the green lazar’s clear visibility.  The cylinder disappeared from view as it got closer to the full moon’s brightness heading towards Lake Ontario.  From when we first noticed it until it was no longer obvious to the eye was about 2-minutes.  No phone or camera was with us. We noticed both objects roughly in the same area of the sky, initially, though they traveled in different directions. It was a very electric energy that awakened and excited us.  This is my 3rd unknown flying object sighting in a week and each time they were witnessed with the same friend.  I wonder if she is the reason why because I have never had a sighting before this, except once, caught on camera in Joshua Tree, CA, in June 2015.  The lights leave me curious but the cylinder object tumbling and spinning is very exciting and highly strange.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
