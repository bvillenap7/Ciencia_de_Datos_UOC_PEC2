Fireball seen falling near Don Mills and Eglinton;2008-09-18 22:45:00;3-7 seconds;Fireball seen falling near Don Mills and Eglinton A friend of mine was driving me home that night from tennis.  Heading east on Eglinton Ave. just before passing the stoplights on Wynford Drive we both noticed a teardrop/fireball appear in the sky moving on a downward diagonal North East before disappearing a few seconds later.  It appeared to be no higher than the Wynford condominiums that were in proximity.   It was really something to see and my friend and I were wondering if were a meteorite or a burning piece of satellite. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide a minimum of contact information.

5-6 meandering and mingling translucent white teardrop shaped phenomena.;2015-04-18 23:00:00;7 seconds;5-6 meandering and mingling translucent white teardrop shaped phenomena. I was sitting in my backyard facing west and overlooking a ravine when I observed 5-6 teardrop shaped, translucent orbs fly NW over me.  They flew in an S type meandering method in groups of 2 & 3 then switched positions.  They mingled as they flew, similar top how smaller birds do. They weren't really orbs, more like flying translucent white ghostly tear drops or sprites. Not really solid and the tail kind've trailed behind.  They didn't appear as physical objects as we know it. It was one of the coolest things I've ever seen. I was wondering, could it be birds?  But it was late for birds, they don't travel that fast, and they don't dance around each other effortlessly while flying, and they certainly don't glow white or look like flying ghosts.  Also, birds and bats have wings, these did not!;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
