various coloured fireball emitting sparks and totally silent;1971-07-15 11:00:00;3 seconds;various coloured fireball emitting sparks and totally silent My friend and I were being chased by his brother in my backyard and we simultaneously saw an oval shaped fireball streaking through the sky very low. It was emitting gold, silver, green, and orange sparks and was silent and moved very fast. We thought it hit the top of an apartment building nearby so we ran towards it. My other friend who lived across the street was coming to call on me and also noticed it. When we arrived at the apartment building, numerous people were walking about looking around and talking about it. There was no physical evidence.

slow moving orange fireball picked up on video;2001-01-21 00:40:00;10 min+-;slow moving orange fireball picked up on video I was changing then bindings of my snowboard in the livingroom of my residence.  Something out the window caught my eye. Thinking it was an aircraft from Toronto Pearson Airport I resumed working on the board.  Upon taking a second glimse, I realized that it was pretty strange, I grabbed my digital video camera and taped the object by hanging dangerously outside my second story window.  I managed to get a couple minutes of footage.  What I saw seemed to be a slow moving fireball. There were no common green, red, blue or clear aircraft navigation lights.  This was a fire orange colour that seemed constant. I was wondering if maybe it was an aircraft in trouble.No reports yet of any. This object moved form the Western sky to the south.  I ran outside to get more footage.  Any way I called police asking if there were any reports of aircraft trouble but they could not help. Oh well.  Anyways, I thought I would see if there was any way iIcould report this strang incident.  Pretty amazing!  This does not seem to different to your report on the main page with the orange glow that was also picked up on video.  Thanks. ((initials deleted));43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

At Ontario Place, Festival of Fire (Fireworks), 3 craft looking like comets (with long bright white tails) or slow meteors, traveled horizontally across the sky (past the Scorpio constellation - facing south over Lake Ontario) at constant velocity, brightness and altitude for about a minute and then disappeared behind the fireworks.  Helicopters filled the air shortly after. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of re-entering space debris.  PD));43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Toronto, fireball trailing craft at low altitude over downtown area.  There must be more witnesses.;2005-07-30 01:00:00;5 Seconds;Toronto, fireball trailing craft at low altitude over downtown area.  There must be more witnesses. I walked outside of a building and something in the sky caught my attention.  I looked up in time to see a fireball overhead which I thought to be an unusually close comet because the fire was red.   It was moving slowly so it couldn't have been a comet.  In fact when my brain adjusted on it, I realized it couldn't have been more than 3 - 5 hundred feet in altitude.   Looking closer I noticed two circular glowing red holes like jet engines at the back of a dark un quantifyable craft from where this huge fireball was protruding the fireball must have been 50 ft. long once compared to the size and altitude of the craft.   Than the fireball completely vanished leaving the two glowing engines and then they vanished and so did the craft.  I suppose it could have been a jet fighter but let me ask a question to people living in Toronto.  How many jet fighters have you seen speeding over Toronto's downtown sector with their afterburners on?   I bet you it's never happened.  Also there was no sound at all. not even a delayed rumble that you would expect of something like that.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

Fireball seen falling and exploding over the northern horizon in downtown Toronto;2008-03-05 22:25:00;15-20 seconds;Fireball seen falling and exploding over the northern horizon in downtown Toronto At around 10:25 PM last night, Wednesday March 5, 2008, I saw from a North-facing window of my 9th Floor Toronto apartment (not true North but North of the city grid which is in reality North by Northwest), at 45 degrees up in the sky, a fireball that looked like a white flare, descending slowly towards the horizon, not in a straight line, and changing colour.  About halfway down, it exploded/expanded into a bikini-shapep red triangle with a lower yellow fringe for a fraction of second, then continued dropping as a white ball to the horizon, leaving a white trail in its path. The whole thing lasted 15-20 seconds. There were numerous airplanes around in the North sky either approaching or leaving Toronto Pearson International Airport before, during and after the event.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Silent, glowing orange ball in the sky flying above downtown Toronto;2013-09-13 22:36:00;3 minutes;Silent, glowing orange ball in the sky flying above downtown Toronto About an hour ago I looked up and saw what I can only describe as being a glowing ball in the sky.  Orange in colour, brightest at the center fading towards the outer areas.  Didn't matter which direction it headed, it looked the same.  It was to the west of downtown Toronto heading south towards Lake Ontario and the USA.  It was completely silent.  Thought it was a meteor, but too slow and changed directions.  Was too close to not hear it if it was a traditional helicopter or airplane, too far and large to be a Chinese lantern, moving counter to winds as well.  Actually thought it may be a burning airplane for a moment, but no trail was visible.  The glow was quite large and far brighter than any aircraft I've seen before, yet impossible to see the object itself or its shape.  No flashing lights, just a constant somewhat (though very little) pulsating intensity. I observed the object for about 3 minutes.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Orange fireballs over Lake Ontario.  Geometric shapes.;2013-10-13 04:30:00;1 hour;Orange fireballs over Lake Ontario . Geometric  shapes. Last night my girlfriend and I witnessed several orange coloured fireball looking orbs above Lake Ontario. We live in a high rise apartment building on the lakeshore so when we saw the first orb we were so stunned We evacuated the building discreetly on our own.  The orb looked bright orange, was approx 6 times bigger than a star and appeared to be coming closer to us. It was so bright it lit up the water between the Toronto Island, the airport and the shoreline with a bright orange glow.   There was no chance this could have been a flare or a lantern of some kind, it was too bright.  The top of the orb appeared to be emitting a smoke trail.  This is why we exited the building, because I thought it was a meteor of some kind.   Upon reaching the outdoors we could no longer see anything in the sky so we returned indoors after 20 minutes.  When we came back to the window, nothing was in the sky, so I began to research other similar sightings on the Internet, when all of the sudden, it flickered back on like a flashlight.   Over the next hour we watched six different positions in the sky light up, burn quite bright and then turn off.  We couldn't tell if it was the same orb, extinguishing itself and reappearing, but the most we saw lit at the same time was 2.   My girlfriend said she could hear some type of frequency, or sound.  When I opened the door to the balcony I could hear a faint noise but nothing certain.  The orbs appeared to be on fire and floated in 10-15 min intervals somewhat stationary, but moved slightly side to side and appeared to change shape or angle itself to appear to have geometric shapes.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
