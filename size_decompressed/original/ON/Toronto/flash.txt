BURST OF GREEN GLOWING LIGHT IN THE NIGHT SKY;2003-11-05 21:00:00;15 seconds;BURST OF GREEN GLOWING LIGHT IN THE NIGHT SKY WHAT I SAW I DON'T REALLY THINK IT WAS A UFO, BUT I KNOW IT WAS SOMETHING!! I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE HWY 427 NORTH IN TORONTO CANADA, TOWARDS THE MEETING OF HWY 401 EAST. THE TIME WAS AT 21:00HRS AND THERE WAS TWO WITNESSES IN THE CAR AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING. WHAT WAS IN THE SKY WAS A BURST OF GLOWING GREEN LIGHT AND THEN IT FLEW THROUGH THE SKY TILL THE LIGHT BURNED OUT. IT WAS ALMOST AS IF IT SEEMED COMPARABLE TO A FALLING STAR OR A COMET BECAUSE OF IT'S SPEED IN THE NIGHT SKY. I'VE TRIED TO LISTEN TO THE NEWS FOR ANY COMMENTS ON THE OCCURANCE BUT I'VE HEARD NOTHING. SO I'M WONDERING WHAT IT COULD BE? IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING BURNING, AND IN OUR ORBIT? I DON'T REALLY FOLLOW TOO MUCH SPACE STUFF BUT ONE THING I KNOW FOR SURE I'M TELLING THE TRUTH AND I KNOW WHAT I SAW AND WHAT I SAW IS NOT NORMAL TO ME. SO MAYBE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP ME SOLVE THIS MYSTERY, ANY GUIDENCE THAT WOULD LEAD ME IN THE RIGHT WAY TO SOLVING THIS UNKNOWN SIGHTING WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Blue flash on a sunny day??;2004-07-18 12:00:00;seconds;Blue flash on a sunny day?? This really isn't a UFO sighting but it is a strange appearance in the DAY sky.... clear sunny day approx noonish, I was walking through a park to a friends house, I looked up in the sky to see a HUGE BLUE fireball, the flash caugth my attention.. It was way up their dont' think it was from earth, but outer space.  The blue of the fireball stuck out against a solid blue sky, i was quite impressed and quite puzzeled by it.. The reason I think it was from space is for the fact that it did not make a sound and an explosion that big I was expecting the bang as I continued to walk but heard nothing.. What would it take to make an explosion of blue flame, atleast the size of 4 football fields(looking up from the ground) appear from outerspace?? my first thought was a space craft blew up but when i got to my buddies i couldn't find anything on the news. This event happend before the columbia incident which i saw on TV and the BLue flame explosion was atleast 30x greater than the explosion I witnessed when columbia went down..
