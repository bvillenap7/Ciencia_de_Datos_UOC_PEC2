Just so u know i work south of Toronto International Airport and see jets all the time usually not at 2 in the morning and not without some lights ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Glowing golden rectangle with gold/orange ball on tail.;2014-07-01 21:47:00;30 seconds;Glowing golden rectangle with gold/orange ball on tail Golden glowing aircraft with Gold/orange transparent ball on tail end.  Flew slowly about 300 feet in the air with no noise what so ever.  I could not focus on it.  I have great vision and every time I tried to focus on it.  It became more obscure.  Less than 2 min later.   A helicopter with a large (white) light flew the same path.  The helicopter was really loud.

Dark blue rectangular shape in clouds above with 2 surrounding rings.;2015-05-11 01:30:00;2 hours;Dark blue rectangular shape in clouds above with 2 surrounding rings. Huge rectangular shape seen on and in the cloud level directly above.  The edges were clear with high contrast.  It was opaque but appeared transluscent.   The colours were similar to its surroundings.  A dark blue rectangle with a cloudy light white frame.  So it seemed solid but cloaked.  It seemed flat, not three dimensional. The clouds floated below the shape but no clouds floated against or along the shape like clouds would flow around a plane.  It was still for hours.  It looked like clouds had been replaced by the shape and what is left is a cutout in the clouds.  You could see the night sky through other moving clouds but could not see through this shape.  So it was not a see through hole.  Clouds floated below the shape and light did not affect those clouds and, therefore this shape was likely not formed from light shining from the ground.  Although, the clouds that framed it oddly seemed to block our vision from anything above it. Someone else saw 2 or 3 concentric circles around the object like rings you see around sun/moon sometimes. As we went home it seemed as though the farther, long edge of the rectangle angled or bent downward towards us.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

Almost like camera shutters.  It had no noise at all.  I stood there starring at it and the one side kind of folded....I went to the end of the balcony to get a better look and it was gone, or I couldnâ€™t  see it.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
