U.F.O. shoots at large meteor over Toronto, Canada three times and disintegrates it.;1995-08-25 22:00:00;2Hrs. 45MIN.;U.F.O. shoots at large meteor over Toronto, Canada three times and disintegrates it. 1 craft hovered approx. 2000ft. over farm house. 3 others were equal dist. from center craft(approx. 3miles dist.)Got very bright at one point then died down.Then moved sideways and appeared to land.After 15 min. it came back up above the trees then moved back over the farm house.It repeated getting brighter,then dim,then they all left. The other 3 were at 120deg. from each other.This happened from 22:00 to 22:30 1000m from Canada's Wonderland parking lot.Approx. 50 people were standing in the parking lot pointing upwards at the object. On the way home(00:15)heard three loud bangs(six sec. apart)accompanied by truck getting bright each time.Then saw white tear drop object with long halo and tail surrounding it. Taped video of meteor over Toronto on news the next day.Didn't look like tear drop object so ran tape slow motion and on 8 frames saw diamond object going up to meet meteor.This really occured. Did some research and found out that an object had struck somewhere in Windsor and caused a fire.A small basketball sized object had landed in Geogian Bay. Windsor is West of Toronto and Georgian Bay is approx. north. I don't see how a meteor could split in two pieces and these two pieces go in such different directions given the velocity of a meteor. There were many witnesses to this event. Please write to confirm story.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Two objects Dwtn Toronto, Diamond changing shaes and colour and a kidney shaped object seen.;1997-06-10 00:30:00;5 min;Two objects Dwtn Toronto, Diamond changing shaes and colour and a kidney shaped object seen. There were four of us one warm June (I’m not sure of the exact date because it was so long ago) night in a penthouse apartment on the 25th floor right in downtown Toronto.  When to the southwest we saw a flash diamond shaped object hovering.  It was changing shape and colour rapidly from saturated reds, blues greens and shapes of rectangle, square, circles and triangle, it also seemed to be changing in size.  It seemed to hold it position, then faded out.   Immediately afterward while looking for the same object, looking straight up in the sky seen a kidney shaped object with what seemed like white pin lights around its edge traveling south to north at high rate of speed for its high altitude.  All of us had a hard time accepting what we saw and all where at the same conclusion that they were not aircraft.   No one has really spoken of it since.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

They flew in spurts really quick, sometimes in cirlces, they would zig zag back and forth (no airplanes could do this because the passengers would get sick).;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

I could'nt sleep Thursday July 28th at 7:28 AM. I opened my eyes while lying in bed and was Imediatly drawn to this hovering glowing, (although at the time I thought it was just reflecting the early morning sunlight) metallic some what diamond shaped object in the sky. It was difficult to determine the distance but I would guess a couple of KM at least. Almost as soon as I noticed this object it starting to become dimmer, but I then realized it was travelling away from me but at a very fast pace. It then begain to travel even faster and in a upward position. It soon there after disapeared into the clear morning sky.  I am seeking anyone who saw anything in the sky Thurday morning on July 28th 2005 in Toronto.  This thing looked to be pretty large and as far as I know was hovering in the sky for at least 5 seconds. Someone has ha to have seen something.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

Unidentifyed Object flying over Toronto, ON, CA Lakeshore.;2008-07-07 14:30:00;aprx 30 mins;Unidentifyed Object flying over Toronto, ON, CA Lakeshore. It was a peaceful Monday afternoon on Monday July 7, 2008. The weather was warm and the sky was clear blue with a few white clouds. The air was calm with little if any wind.A friend and I were sitting in a parking lot located on Lakeshore Blvd in Toronto – directly in front of the lake.  As my memory recalls there were not a lot of people around as it was a workday at 2:30 p.m. As my friend and I were talking I noticed something up in the sky. It was high up in the clouds way above the local birds flying around. The shape was a diamond, with black and red checkers. There was only one of these objects present. At first I assumed it was a kite, but it was up in the same location moving slowly from side to side for about 30 minutes. After taking the first picture on my camera and zooming in, I realized there was no string attached to this object or ties like a kite would have. There was also no one in our radius that could be flying a kite at this time. The object swayed around for about 30 minutes and than disappeared. I did not directly see it disappear but after watching it for a while I got bored and would occasionally glance up at it. Eventually it was no longer there.  We thought maybe it landed/fell to the ground. But when we searched there was nothing in sight that resembled that object.  I have emailed the four pictures I have to the email provided below.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

Then dispersed and some would cluster again, but many could still be seen in and out of clouds over a period of 15 minutes.  My son who is a pilot said they were a minimum of 80,000 ft. above ground.  Two or more actual planes passed far below which them which allowed for contrast.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
