Then out from around the same place another oject super high and white in colour moved in a side to side motion then disappeared upwards into the atmosphere. But one of the ojects kept going in a north west direction.  This did not look like anything i have seen before.  It was a very clear night and a few clouds you could tell the object was very high because of how much past the clouds it was. And at the height it was moving at unbelieveable speeds.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

One hour later, we saw an object in the sky (maybe the same one).  This time it was right above us at a lower altitude flying south.  It was a circular object with a much dimmer light than the first one.  It was travelling at a constant speed (10 times faster than a plane).;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
circles aroud Toronto;2002-08-03 17:00:00;1 hour;circles aroud Toronto my uncle was looking up at a helicopter when he saw a small circle being followed by a larger circle in which they were moving at the same speed and never moving away from each other.the they were stationary for about 10 minutes in which the smaller one dissappered and about a minute later the bigger one split into two and vanished.After a short period of time many more started flying across the sky and then vanishing in the light.After they would circle back and continue for about 30-40 minutes in which then they were stationary in different spots across the sky.They appeared to be only one when you looked at them but some were really two crafts close together this was known because a near by person had a binoculars which he borrowed.My theroy is if they are ufo that they were there because of the large gathering the day being caribanna where nearly has a million people there.They were not planes either because there is pearson airport and the planes around were visible and were moving at a much slower pase because of them approaching or leaving the airport.This was on a clear day not a single cloud so it was rather easy to see.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
My roomate and I were sitting on our patio having a smoke, enjoying the night sky.;2004-06-23 00:50:00;10 seconds;My roomate and I were sitting on our patio having a smoke, enjoying the night sky.  From above we noticed one large circular craft, glowing whitish traveling at a great speed and making some incredible turns. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I am completely serious. I live in the Spadina/Dupont area of downtown Toronto. My roommate and I were sitting on our patio when I noticed a base-ball sized dimly glowing object in the sky directly above my house (My patio is on the roof).   I immediately told my roomate to look up, he saw it instantly as it was clearly visible to the both of us. The object was circular, glowing a very dim white light. I couldn't make out any other physical details other than its circular shape. It passed directly over us, moving in a westwardly direction along dupont avenue making a number of amazing turning maneouvers and moving at a seemingly incredible rate.  After about 10-15 seconds it was on the western horizon no longer visible. This thing made absolutely no sound. When I first caught a glipse of it in my periphery, I assumed that it was a bird or something similar, because of the way it was gently flopping around in the sky and thelack of noise. However, after fixing my gaze on it I immediately realized that this was something I had never seen before. All of the details I submitted yesterday are as accurate as I can recall (such as time and duration of sighting) Sincerely,  ((name, title, and name of company deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
golden orb at a high rate of speed within clouds;2004-09-25 13:00:00;5 sec;golden orb at a high rate of speed within clouds I am a Police officer employed by the  City of Toronto Ontario . I have been so employed 29 years . In the fall of 2004 in the afternoon I was assigned the traffic enforcement detail . To do this I use a Laser speed measuring device. In the afternoon I was on a major north south road in the city’s east end. I was seated inside my parked auto facing north. I was looking at the heavily overcast skies when something caught my eye. I looked directly overhead and saw a large golden orb. It was within the clouds but the bottom of the orb was slightly lower and visible. The clouds were low but I could tell this object was huge. It moved northbound at a high rate of speed causing a wake in the clouds. I could see it was indeed an orb from a distance before it went out of sight. After several minutes I texted my radio dispatcher by way of the computer and asked if there were any calls for a meteor or lights in the sky. The dispatcher after several minutes confirmed some calls did come in regarding lights in the sky. I kept my sighting to myself and made no report to my superiors. I fully expected something in the evening  news about a meteor in the sky. There were no news reports to my knowledge. Before this incident I had little interest in UFO  sightings etc. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

Girlfriends sister, her boyfriend and I were on my 14th floor balcony having a smoke. Saw a circular shaped  opaque object moving through the sky above the vicinity in a westward direction. We observed it until we lost sight of it as it passed directly over top of my apartment building. Startling yet amazing. Completely silent as it passed over. The object didn't seem to be very high in altitude, although it's difficult to be certain as we're not sure how large it was. Glowing a very dim whitish yellow. Appeared to be quite large, relative to the size of a star in the sky.  Bloor/Dufferin area in Toronto.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

white luminescent orb over lake ontario;2008-08-07 21:20:00;10 minutes;white luminescent orb over lake ontario i was sitting outside about 10 minutes ago watching the electrical storm that is passing over lake ontario. not long after i made myself comfortable, i saw this faint white (and for lack of a better term) luminescent dot in the sky. i thought it was odd, as it didn't look like a plane (i see 5-10 of those a day), so i went inside to get my glasses.  i came back out and it was still there, albeit clearer. it wasn't a star, a satellite, or a meteor (as i've studied those). i looked at it for a while. it looked to have slowed down completely, whereas before it was moving very slowly. i stood there for about 5 minutes, and then decided to go inside.  but curiosity sparked my interest again, and i went back out, only to find that it had disappeared. i went off the property to try and find it, thinking it moved behind a tree or something... but it was nowhere to be found. the sky has been clear for the past hour or so, so it wouldn't be hiding under cloud cover.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

One landed & it was a white Chinese lantern, to my surprise.   This was on the Danforth at Chester.

I was going to get the camera when at the north of the light, kilometers far back, suddenly a big round light shine.  This light was huge, it shined for a second I guess and then went to darkness again. I had never seen something so big.  The moon was full shinning on the west. I called the airport.  Around 3:57am they told me nothing was flying in the area, until 4 :09 and 4:14 they were propellers on the sky.  They suggest me to called transport Canada, which I did.

First came one, then about 10 to 15 minutes later, came another one, and a few minutes later 2 came together.  What was odd is they seemed to follow the exact same path of each other.  They were round and about the size of the nail on your thumb as viewed.  My boyfriend also took video and he is telling me that when he zoomed in it did actually increase in size dramatically ruling out something out as far as a star or the moon, etc., as something so far won’t enlarge that much with normal zooming.

Sighting occurred at 7:00pm on May 13, 2018, right outside the Toronto Zoo in Toronto, Ontario, Canada during daylight. The couple and a young child had just enjoyed a nice day visiting the zoo, when upon driving leaving the zoo, a formation of orbs caught the eye of the passenger through the sunroof of the vehicle.  The couple pulled over and got out of the vehicle and both were able to capture multiple videos and photos of the object. The objects were moving independently changing formations and were very out of place in the sky from anything we had ever seen before.  The objects were directly above the vehicle and seemed to follow the vehicle for another few hundred meters down the road and seemed to stop and hover above the location where we had pulled over for at least 20 minutes they were witnessed.  Taking many different formations and patterns during this time.  There also appeared to be an increase in aircraft in the general area shortly after the orbs had been sighted.

Hello, I was out walking my dog the other week around 11:00 pm and saw something curious. I saw three stars in the sky and thought it was Orion's belt, but then noticed that were slowly moving southbound towards Lake Ontario.  The three orbs (they just looked like stars, they were very distant) moved along at a constant pace, southbound. Then I noticed another orb appear on the north end of the line, also moving southbound. More orbs started appearing in this fashion in a straight line, steadily moving southbound. When the line was about 5 orbs long, the southmost one would disappear. Approximately 7-10 orbs appeared and travelled along this route until they faded from the sky one by one reaching the end of the line .  Nothing crazy, just thought it seemed curious and I didn't know what they could be.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
