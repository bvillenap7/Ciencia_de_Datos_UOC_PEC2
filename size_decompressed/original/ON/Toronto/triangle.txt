dark triangle blanks out stars, lights appear;1977-07-26 22:00:00;5- 10 minutes;dark triangle blanks out stars, lights appear This event occured north of Toronto, either travelling north from Toronto to AFB Bordon (where my father was posted) or travelling west from Beaverton, ON to AFB Bordon. I recall leaving from celebrating my Aunt's 50th birthday party weekend at the time. She had a condo in Toronto and a cottege in Beaverton, so recalling my 7 year old memory is slightly dusty which is why I don't recall where we were coming from (nor does my family). My sister and I were in the back seat of the family car and we had our heads up in the rearview window (right. no seat belt requirement then) as we often did. We noticed a black triangle blanking out the stars and very slight amount of high, wispy cloud that evening. We thought it was strange and thought it was even more bizarre when slightly pulsating red lights came on at all three points. It traveled with us 3-5 thousand feet (?) above us and matched our speed. This only lasted for a few minutes and it took off picking up speed slowly until it was gone. When I saw the Stealth years later, it prompted me to think again of the object I saw as a child 30 years ago. As my dad worked in aviation at this AFB, I asked him these years later if the Stealth had ever been there at that time. He laughed and said no. I'm curious if there is anyone else out there that had seen this in the area west to the 400, east to HW 12, South to HWY 7 or north in a line between Beaverton/ Sutton/ Barrie/ Base Bordon.

3 dim trianglular lights on a black trangular base moving slowly low to the ground over Toronto W to E.;1996-05-24 01:50:00;1-2 minutes;3 dim trianglular lights on a black trangular base moving slowly low to the ground over Toronto W to E. It was Victoria Day weekend in Canada...the Saturday Night and my friends and I were out having a few drinks (yes we were *slightly intoxicated*).  After leaving a Bar around College and Bathurst in downtown Toronto we ending up in a children's playground of a school near Harbbord & Bathurst.  3 males and a female and we where having a cigarette when the female member of our group said Hey, check out the seagulls...Since I am an avid amateur ornothologist I immediately lookup up (so did the other 2 males).  Instantly we all recognised that they were NOT seagulls.  All our impressions of the object/s vary slighly including altitude and size.  My perception is as follows:  What was originally percived as seaguls were actually white occolating/slightly-glowing triangle shaped pads (flat on the bottom but seemed to be wobbling, which originally looked like wings flapping to the female who first spotted them/it).  The 3 slightly glowing triangles were in the formation of a triangle - this made it hard to tell if they were 3 seperate objects or all part of the same object.  Indeed it was a dark moonless night with almost no wind at all (I could lite a match and it'd burn to the end).  The Object/s were moving from W to E (direction of the wind) at a low altitude (again, our perceptions differ).  To me it appeared to be about 100 ft (twice as high as the city tree tops and standard Seagull hight) and there was no noise.  Although it only seemed to be moving about 10-15kph there didn't seem to be enough wind to propell anything at that speed.  The 3 glowing triangles never varied in distance from each other - which led us to believe they were attached/tethered to each other or perhaps there was a large dark object (we could not see anything between the smaller triangles though it could have been a very dark object against a really dark sky) and the smaller triangles would be at the bottom 3 corners of the black triangular base.  We watched the entire time, from when it was first spotted (directly above our heads) until it dissapeared into the eastern horizon (about 1.5-3 minutes).  We had lots of time to discuss between us what were were looking at.  2 thought the object was more like 500 ft up.  1 (the female) thought it was just at tree level and I figure it was twice tree level (about 100-130 ft)- I am into bird watching, amateur astronomy, amateur aviation and amateur meteorology aswell as entomology...so if it's in the sky I have a good idea about it...I'm also an excellent judge of distance and hight.  From my perspective the size of the object (if it was around 120 ft) is: each glowing triangle was about 3 feet square and about 13-18 feet apart from each other.  Lastly, the next day (Sunday of that long weekend) I saw a military jet moving from west to east along more or less the same path as the object from the night before.  There were no airshows going on in the city and it is unusual to see a jet fighter over Toronto otherwise.  The jet was moving fairly slow.  I tried to report this to MUFON at the time but they didn't have website reporting and I never received the reporting form from them as promised over the phone.  We were all pretty well affected by our sighting and were anxious to discover what it was...to this day we still don't know. ((name deleted));43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

Toronto Canada- Triangle shaped object with lights and beam of light;2000-11-21 22:30:00;1 minute;Toronto Canada- Triangle shaped object with lights and beam of light I was walking down a busy downtown street and I observed a very loud buzzing noise in the air directly above me. I looked up and saw a very large triangle shape that was lit up by hundreds of small lights around the outside of the craft. I looked around to see if anybody else was witnessing what I was seeing but there was nobody around me except for the people in their cars on the street. The triangle formation was too tight to be a formation of planes, at no point did the lights move from oneanother or separate from their formation. I saw a smaller cluster of lights on the bottom of the craft and in the middle of the triangle. The cluster of lights began to flash and spin around in circles. At that time I saw a brighter light shining out from the smaller cluster of lights that were flashing. A beam of light very similar in size to a spot light began to shin down towards the ground. It was very unusual but the beam of light did not touch the ground, it stopped about 20 or 30 feet above the ground. I could not figure out why the light was not touching the ground but you could see where exactly the beam stopped. then after about a minute of watching this,it (the ufo) tilted upward and took off straight up into the sky from a dead stop where I saw it. Within less that a second the triangle was gone. As it took off there was a very faint streak of what looked like flames coming from the back of the ufo. This was not seen by anybody else that I asked on the street and I placed a call to the police and asked if they had recieved any calls about it but they said that they did not. I hope that this story helps to figure out what kind of visitors we are having in our atmosphere. Thanks,  Name withheld;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

It was raining and cloudy, so the craft was reasonably low (less than 1000 feet I would guess). It moved relatively slow (compared to a commercial jet).  It made no sound.  I was biking to work and noticed it in the sky.  I stopped to watch it, and heard nothing (even after it had disappeared from sight behind buildings).  Plus, there were no commercial aircraft permitted to fly yesterday morning, because of the terrorist attacks in the US. The two things that seemed strange to me, was the fact that there was no sound (and it wasn't as if there was a lot of traffic on the roads to drown it out), and the pattern of the lights.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
What we saw for 5 minutes on Tuesday made believers out of 10 of us......;2002-08-27 23:30:00;5 minutes;What we saw for 5 minutes on Tuesday made believers out of 10 of us...... 23:30 - About 10 of my friends were at Cherry Beach (just south of downtown Toronto)ready to have a bonfire / bush party when 2 of my friens noticed bright lights coming from the south towards us. These lights separated forming 2 triangle type shapes. Within what must have been 20 seconds they were over us. They stopped above us then moved about ten feet south again over the lake. Then one came down on top of the water and hovered there. This one triangle was all black with lights on the three corners. We could see what looked like 2 windows on the front of it. They were illuminated a bluish colour.We could see what looked like to be people or something moving around in there. There was a door or something that opened on the right side of this thing and something came out that looked roundish in shape and scooped up some water. Then this thing took off straight up in the air. we moved back because we felt an intense heat just shoot out form it. These two things then took off again to the south. We have video of this event which we are now in the process of showing our local police and news departments.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
A triangular object, lit at all corners, seen travelling at great speed changes direction sharply without pausing or turning.;2004-07-29 21:03:00;1 second;A triangular object, lit at all corners, seen travelling at great speed changes direction sharply without pausing or turning. - It was fast, travelling somewhat low to the ground (~ 10,000 ft?). - It was large and triangular in shape. - It had blue/red lights on its corners (much like a plane, but they seemed brighter). All three corners were lit. The lights did not resemble plane lights that were observed in the minutes following when the sky was scanned for planes. - It was flying North, then it SHARPLY changed direction to the North-East without slowing down or turning at all. - It was completely silent (low-flying planes can be heard clearly even from indoors). - It left no trail. - It was seen through a window from indoors. - It was about dusk when it was seen its shape could be seen clearly, the sky was still somewhat light. - It did not seem to fly anything like a plane (it was actually mistaken for an extremely fast and low-flying plane until it was seen changing direction so abruptly).;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

The object was very small and very high in the sky. It was in one spot it did not move. It had 3 bright lights in triangle form and one of the lights was dimmer. I stood there looking at it for 10 minutes then my bus came so I left. It was not a balloon or jet plane. It was an object high in the sky. It seemed to move back and forth a little but it could have been the wind. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Large triangle-shaped, pitch black silhouette, silent running craft seen gliding over Lake Ontario near the Toronto Islands.;2014-06-23 01:00:00;5 seconds;Large triangle-shaped, pitch black silhouette, silent running craft seen gliding over Lake Ontario near the Toronto Islands. June 23rd, 2014, just past midnight of a very beautiful clear night, I was sitting out on the terrace of my 13th floor waterfront condo enjoying the night sky out over Lake Ontario. It was near 1:00 am when three round disk shaped objects floating through the sky caught my attention.  The disks were dark grey in colour, but visible enough to be seen in contrast to the black sky beyond. While startled by the objects, I was able to quickly focus and observed the 3-disks were located at the vertices of a very large triangle-shaped pitch black silhouette craft, silent running and gliding over Lake Ontario near the Toronto Islands and the Eastern Channel. I observed the craft for only about 5 seconds as it moved west to east parallel to the waterfront in a relatively slow gradual descent from a position of about 15-20 degrees above the horizon covering approximately 200m or so before disappearing into the night sky. I would like to know if anyone else had a similar sighting on this night or any other.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

On Friday, Sept. 02/16 - I was taking some photos of an air-show when I saw something else in the sky behind me.  It looked like a triangular piece of Styrofoam flipping and floating through the air, so I snapped a few shots. Once I had gone inside and put the photos on my computer, I couldn't really make out what the object really was, so I used a sharpening tool on my photo editing software, and found very odd results. I did the same edit to another photo of the airplanes from the air-show and nothing peculiar there. Something is very odd and suspicious within the flight patterns of the white object I saw. I am not sure what this is, or what it means and I would like some opinions or answers here please.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
