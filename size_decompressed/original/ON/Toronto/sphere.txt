Witnessed glowing sphere land in middle of urban area, had confirmation from authorities.;1972-08-15 01:00:00;240 minutes;Witnessed glowing sphere land in middle of urban area, had confirmation from authorities. This took place in the summer of 1972, possibly mid-august, in Toronto Canada.  On summer visit to grandmother's house there, I and my best friend (teenagers at the time) noted that the dark kitchen was lit up like daylight at 1 a.m... but it was strange orange light... running to window, we saw enormous orange sphere more than six storeys tall landing in an open ravine area beyond local business district, which was visible from the window there. We watched for some time as the craft settled slowly into the clearing beyond apartment buildings 2 blocks away... no sound, but so bright it lit up the whole neighborhood. When it landed, one could still see the top of it over top of the apt blocks (hence estimation of more than 6 storeys tall when landed)... We had NO fear, wanted to go down there and see up close, but grandmother and aunt woke up in our commotion and forbid us to go. Grandmother (a retired school teacher) and Aunt (a CBC television costume designer) saw craft as well as us. Called my parents in California to get my Dad to aid in keeping us girls in the house, he remembers this call. Aunt suggested I call police. Police operator answered and I suddenly lost my voice, didn't know what to say... stammmered umm umm... she said you calling from Forest Hill?  I said I was.  You calling about the flying saucer I said I was.  (her words)   Can you see it now? I said I could. Can you see the hi rises from where you are? I said I could. She then said Everyone in those hi-rises has already called us.  She went on to tell me that they were telling people to stay in their houses, and that patrol cars were in the area to investigate. We watched for more than another hour, the craft still visible on the ground beyond the hi rises.  Eventually my aunt made us go to bed. We lay on the floor and listened to Toronto all night talk radio, and all the calls were about the sighting. Eventually we fell asleep on the floor in front of the radio, waking at daybreak, at which point we ran down to the area, and found NO signs of anything. No flattened grass, singed ground, nothing.  We tried to call talk radio and got told that  they were taking no more calls about flying saucers. Toronto is a busy city and there is lots more important stuff going on. There was nothing in either newspaper (telegram or star) and we called both newsrooms to be told that reputable papers didn't bother with silly nonsense like flying saucers. We called the police and were told that the night before there were some reports of some sort of prank in our area (Forest Hill Village - an upper class neighborhood in the middle of the city) but that investigating officers had found no signs of anything out of the ordinary. The Sphere was perfectly round, noiseless, and glowed with an amazing shade of pure clear orange light that entirely lit up the neighborhood bright as day.  It took about 20 minutes to land gently in the field beyond the aprtments. The field is still there 20 years later, between Spadina and Bathhurst, this took place just beyond the intersection of Lonsdale and Spadina in the middle of Forest Hill there... After it landed we could still see the top of it over the buildings between it and us, but with no movement and no sound, after a couple of hours we were almost bored, and frustrated that we were not being allowed out of the house for a closer look. The police operator told me that everyone in these hirises (also visible to us) had called them, she seemed to be caught up in it at the moment, I consider the police operator to have verified this sighting to me. I have filed reports of this sighting with a few other researchers and groups over the years, because I can't believe I'm the only witness still around, it had to have been seen by many people, the police operator told me their lines were ringing off the hook... (remember in '72 they didn't have caller ID even at the police station, she ASKED me if I was in Forest Hill) Today I am 41, mother of a teenager, work as the station manager of a local cable company community access television channel here in B.C.'s gulf islands... am college educated, don't drink or smoke... I know what I saw, remember the entire incident vividly. The aunt and grandmother who saw this with me are dead now, but my father is here and alive and remembers the telephone call from my aunt when my friend (who is traceable) and I were so intent to go outside and get a closer look at this object;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Stationary shimmering ball of light.;1975-09-07 19:00:00;2 hours;Stationary shimmering ball of light. About 7pm, someone noticed a light out over Lake Ontario.  I initially thought it was a small plane which was heading to the Toronto Island airport.  Within a few seconds I could tell that the light was stationary.  I happened to have a small telescope already setup in our spare bedroom.  I brought it out to our balcony and focused it to the light.  It was a round shimmering ball.  Not hard surfaced, but gaseous.  I could focus to the far side of the lake and see trees and buildings on the far shore.   Focusing back on the light, it appeared to be at least ¾ of the way across the lake, maybe more.  Hard to estimate the size of the light/object:  maybe as small as a Volkswagen, or as large as a small bus?   We were on the 16th floor our apartment building at 22 Close Avenue in Toronto.  Our vantage point was to the south.  The light/object was at about the same height as us.  Around 8pm we went inside to have dinner.  I left the table several times: the light was still in scope.  I never moved my scope once.   Shortly after 9pm, I went back out to the balcony and before I could put my eye to the eyepiece, I could see the light was finally moving slowly but steadily to the right, heading west towards Hamilton, Ontario.   I lost sight of the light when it went out of view behind the corner of our apartment building.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Saw three glowing red balls of light at night. Witnessed with my brother.;1983-12-01 20:00:00;5-6 seconds;Saw three glowing red balls of light at night.  Witnessed with my brother. I should start by pointing out that there’s a typo in your agreement form “ identity will not be revealed,“.  In a field already fraught with skepticism, I think it’s important to adresss little details like that to elevate the credibility of the site. My sighting happened many years ago, but it’s something that I’ve thought about many times since.  I was around 18 at the time, walking up a residential street in the evening when my brother suddenly stopped and  shouted “look at that!” pointing frantically across the street. I turned just in time to see three red, glowing balls of light flying closely together over the rooftops.  They were approximately the size of cantaloupes, and moved in the most astonishing and whimsical fashion.  They were maybe forty or fifty feet away from us and were completely silent. The entire event lasted only seconds, but I saw them very clearly. There was something erratic and yet also organized about the way they zigged and zagged together - their movements beautifully interwoven and coordinated - almost the way fish move together in a school. They changed directions so quickly, it almost  seemed to defy the laws of gravity they altered course instaneously, which I think is the reason my brain had trouble processing what I was seeing. In an instant they flew away behind some trees and were gone. This last part is purely my subjective observation, so take it with a grain of salt, but I had the sense that there was something about the way they moved that was suggestive of intelligence and agency it was very playful, whimsical, and lifelike.  I should also add that I’ve been a very skeptical person all my life.  If I hadn’t witnessed them with my brother I would have assumed I had hallucinated them.  I’ve searched for rational explanations... ball lightning, balls of plasma.  To be honest, I have no idea what we saw.  For a long time after we stood on the street in disbelief.  There’s an expression, “cosmic laughter”, that best describes how I felt.  It was as if the curtain had been pulled back for an instant and we had seen something we weren’t supposed to see.

It looked strange enough to comment on. Then suddenly vanished into thin air. Perplexed, I asked if any of my friends noticed what had occured and lucky enough a chick standing behind me agreed that she had witnessed the same thing in the sky and with the same breath asked me not to mention what we had just seen again. It was obvious to me she was startled and upset at what she had just witnessed where as it had the opposite effect on me.

Large rusty sphere;1994-10-10 23:00:00;~1 hour;Large rusty sphere It was a fall night and I looked out the window and saw a huge sphere over Taylor Creek in Toronto.  It was a rusy colour with a large steel looking band around its middle.  I went next door to get my neighbour to see it and him and his 4 yr old son came over.  We watched it for a long time and finally the four year old sez Hey Dad I think thats an UFO.   The neighbour grabbed his son and he couldn't get out of my yard fast enough. It was bigger then the moon and was only about 20 stories in the air.  I got freaked out and went into the house and I closed the curtains.  And the four year old was the only one who had the guts to say it was an UFO!;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
The bright blue object moved very fast across the sky and it was visible as it went on front of the moon that it was sphere shaped.;1996-06-15 22:00:00;about 5 seconds;The bright blue object moved very fast across the sky and it was visible as it went on front of the moon that it was sphere shaped. This event took place several years ago while I was living in Toronto. I believe it was 1996 but don't remember the month or day all I know is that that night there was a full moon and that my window faced the west. My bedroom was located on a second floor and my window faced the moon at about 10:00 pm. I used to stare at the moon during the full moon stages through my window. On the night of the event, I was looking at the moon when suddenly I saw a sphere shaped object of small size, almost a dot. It was traveling from North to South and was of a very bright neon blue color. The object traveled in a straight line across the moon at a very fast speed. I observed the object for about five seconds until it was out of sight. At first I didn't know what it was but it really cought my attention. Afterwards I tried to identify what it was and thought it could vave been a plane. The thing is that the object was obviously very far away and at the speed that it traveled at that distance away it could not have possibly been a plane or jet of any sort. Also, as it went across the moon, it was clearly visible as a sphere shaped object and still very bright although the full moon served as a background. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is 1996 is approximate.

Follow up to fireball/sphere- video tape viewed -no explanations worthy;2001-01-21 00:40:00;5min;Follow up to fireball/sphere- video tape viewed -no explanations worthy Hello again, I am the same witness that reported seeing a fireball outside my window, high in the sky while repairing my snowboard bindings on Sun morning, the 21 of Jan. at 12:40 am. This second submission is intended as an update after a time of reflection. I originally described this object as some sort of fire ball moving across the western sky into the south in a continuous arching fashion.  I previously mentioned that I had fortunately grabbed my digital video camera and tapped this strange event .  I have viewed the tape over and over in slow motion frame by frame.  This object resembles a golden sphere that sometimes can be seen quite clearly. Unfortunately a was excited as hell and could not hold the camera perfectly still.  Upon using the telephoto lens and also zooming out for scale,the object  is definately something that is unexplainable by myself, or the 12 other people that have viewed the tape so far. Highly educated and professional standing people that I presented it to have no clue what it is, however, together they all agree that it is definately eerie. I'm not into UFO's, nor do I really want to push this issue with anyone because I dont really want to get hung up on reserching the hell out of it, but it was so strange that I decided to call Transport Canada, Enviorment Canada and believe it or not, I was connected on Sunday morning to Pearson International Airport's control tower shift manager because I actually thought I had a video of a plane in an emergency and wondered if they would need it.  I spoke to the shift manager and he had said that there were no reports of trouble in the air earlier that morning. I described to him what I had on tape and he came up with expanations such as a meteor or a plane burning surplus fuel.  I see alot of aircraft in this area and they make noise, even high up in the statosphere.  This did not make a sound. I even went sofar as to record aircraft and a star from the same window last night to see how they would compare to my original fireball/sphere recording. NOT EVEN CLOSE! After seeing this thing I went to the internet for explanations.  I have never been to your site nor any other UFO sites before.  I managed to read some similar sounding occurances and have concluded in my own mind that what I saw was definately strange. I will leave it up to who ever views the tape to conclude what it is for themselves.  I can't wait to hear the next explanation;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

Two spheres or discs flying parallel in the sky;2004-03-25 18:30:00;2 minutes;Two spheres or discs flying parallel in the sky Perhaps this is related to the account on the same evening from the airliner crew over Omaha, NE.  This is what I witnessed in the sky over Toronto on Mar 25, 2004 at 6:30 pm EST, and I would like to preface this by saying my eyesight is much better than 20/20, especially when viewing something long distance:   Two small (10 feet in diameter at the most) black or dark coloured orbs/spheres or discs in the sky, floating (I would say flying but they were wingless) silently and parallel to each other, from west to east following identical flight paths and speed.  The more southern of the two was perhaps (estimate) 20 or 30 full size passenger plane lengths ahead of the other.  Due to the formation I kept looking to see if there was a 3rd object where one would expect it be (the 3rd point in the hypothetical triangle) but there certainly was not.  I also kept looking between the two discs to see if they were connected by anything visible, but again, nothing but the cloud above them was seen.  I could hear various air traffic above me that evening but not see any airplanes as the clouds were quite low, yet these objects were beneath the cloud cover.  When they were a fair distance away from me and I had a more head on angle view to them I noticed they appeared to be gyrating in the manner in which a bullet travels down a barrel of a gun (tight spirals) as it moves forward.  Eventually they just became too far away to see.  Sincerely ((name deleted));43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Weird Lights Following;2007-08-19 20:45:00;1 minute;Weird Lights Following I was sitting outside around sunset this evening, and I noticed first a bright light in the sky as if it was a plane. But something was strange with this plane, It was traveling extremely high up in the sky, and at first I thought it was a plane, but what plane could travel that high in the sky and that fast?  Then, after i saw the initial light, a second just as bright light was following maybe 10 kilometers away from the first...Moving at the same speed! I ran inside to get the camera, and by that time the two lights which were traveling North to South had passed. Everyone I was with were in shock, and we have no idea what to think about this. Stars would not be flying so close to each other at the same speed and the chances of seeing 2 shooting stars following each other could be hardly possible. There were no tails on these lights, and they did not lose brightness intensity at all. Please if you could email me back it would be greatly appreciated.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

The aircraft looked spherical but wobbled on an axis. It looked like a rubber raft in the air. It did not make noise.  10 people witnessed this craft, unable to identify it, during the air show. The 10 people are all family members and were watching the air show from an upper level condominium building. The air show website makes no mention of such a craft. None of the observers have ever seen such a thing. None of the observers took a picture as everyone was too amazed, trying to figure out what they were looking at.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

Bright blue orb in Toronto.;2013-07-06 21:45:00;5 minutes;Bright blue orb in Toronto I was walking my dog around the neighbourhood and talking on my phone to a friend.  I saw a bright blue orb that was much larger than a plane.   It was as bright, or brighter, than a star/planet, but the only way to describe the colour would be LED blue.  It also appeared to have this spot on it that was pink or red, but i wouldnt call it a light (like the lights on planes) it just appeared to be part of the colour...it didn't blink.  It caught my attention and I stopped and looked at it, while telling the person on the phone all about it. I'm not someone who is &quotinto&quot UFO stuff.  I'm describing everything I'm seeing to him and he says take a video, I try to but you cant take a video and talk at the same time (iphone.)  I thought it would go away or that maybe it was a star or planet, but when it started bobbing I had to hang up on the friend to shoot the video.  2 people behind me were walking on the sidewalk ! and also looked up at it.  They kept looking up at it as they walked away, but they didnt speak to me and just kept walking and looking back at it.  I cant estimate the distance because I am really bad with that, but you can tell by the size and distance of the plane that passes by on the video that it is very high up and much larger than the plane.  When i started taking the video it appeared stationary.  Although it was bright blue to my eye it showed up bright white on the camera, although some shots when it moves show it blue.  Anyway, it was just hovering very high in the air.  I can't say it was in any directio.   but I was facing south.   Then a plane travelled across the sky (from west to east) and below it (I couldn't see the plane's entire path because a house blocked the view at that point).  But, it started to move subtly when the plane went under.   Then it bobbed a bit and dropped and then quickly zoomed off in a westerly direction.  The same speed as watching a satellite against stars.   I ran around the corner! to the street behind the house to try and see it, facing west.  There were so many trees but this time it showed up blue on the video too.  It appeared to sort of bob or float down, faster than before and then drop out of view.   I ran around to the park to see if i could find it again, but it was gone or my view was blocked by all the houses and trees.  Never saw anything after that.  When i went home and watched the videos I noticed that when I thought it was stationary it was actually slowly moving at times.   Moving and stopping.  Fast and slow at the same time if that makes sense. Here is a link to my videos:  1) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8OFCaNNvG0  2) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6mSGP0H6eg;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

I was watching a satellite or the ISS travel SW from NE.  Then, two orange-red lights/orbs or something linear (?) with lights at the ends caught my eye seemingly secretly travelling slowly in a straight line towards ~magnetic north.  There was not a distinct outline but were rather translucent, hazy or out of focus although it's not me eyes. Their flight configuration was roughly 30-40 degress off 0 deg, similar to a colon on a -ve 30-40 deg angle. It/they were travelling in a straight trajectory but it was like watching a truck in front of you, and if the frame alignment is off it looks as though its turning while driving. If they were separate the motion/inertia looked as though it was linked somehow, the way a single object would move.  Like a flashlight with lights at each end. Bonafide flying something from somewhere or here!!??  Then I saw another large bright white ORB/satellite/ISS.  A little while later I saw two flashes in the sky.  Later, and likely unrelatedly, I observed two flashes in the sky/space approximately where Ursa Major (Bear) and the Lynx constellations heads meet.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

A possible ET abduction or experiment at bedroom during midnight hours.;2016-09-02 00:00:00;Few minutes;A possible ET abduction or experiment at bedroom during midnight hours It was the night of Friday, Sep 2, 2016.  After a long day of work, I retired to my bed and ready to sleep.  I also had a lunch meet-up appointment with my buddy on the next day so I went to bed by midnight, which was earlier than my usual Friday night sleep time. Perhaps sometime at 1 or 2 am, I was awake but still in my bed.  There was a bright white light emitting from my 4 o'clock (my head is at 12 o'clock position as a reference).  The light came from a white ball of light. It was so bright that my eyes were filled with tears and I had to turn my head slightly to the left to avoid it.  The light was so white and bright like it was coming from either a high power flood light or the sun.  It must be noted that although the washroom light was on during the night and it was in the vicinity of my bed, it was a energy saving light bulb and its colour was yellowish dim. I remember that right before I turned my head, there was a tingling sensation in my breathing tube traveling upward between my collar bone to my jaw.  It was itching and I remember that I brushed my neck with both hands downward. I don't remember seeing any entities or physical contacts during the entire event and I was laid down on my bed the entire time  I also dont remember if my lower body was immobile. The next day, I got up with the sense of a bit restless but didnt give much thought. My friend later noticed that I was behaving a little bit agitated while I was looking for a parking spot at mall. It could be the result of the event or perhaps it was stress related. But our lunch was the last meat I have eaten for the past three months. Somehow that encounter changed my diet habit and I dont find red meat and chicken appetizing anymore.  My diet has become almost vegetarian.  I do eat fish and seafood from time to time, but I know I can also live without them.  My weight dropped and I felt more healthy and my brain more active for all these months. What really blew my mind was a physical evidence that I cannot simply treat this as a dream or human psychological response to stress.  This event had left a physical mark on my chest.  I found it very similar to the scoop mark left on some of the abductees' bodies.  It has been three months since the event and that mark still remains in its original shape and colour.  There is no other physical symptoms, pain or itching coming from it.  Of course, it wasnt there before and no scratch cannot heal in three months. I don't sense it was a malevolent encounter and I have not had another one since then, or at least any that I can remember.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

At one point my mothers voice faded away as did the sounds of conversation from the tenants in the parking lot below us.  That is when I noticed one bulb-orb was bright white emitting more light than the rest, not just glowing. I barely noticed the first three bc we were having a smoke and chatting they were passing directly over us at that point.  I could see more coming and ran in to the apt to get the phone...i came back out to photo the end of the line which was just travelling over us by that time but the phn woudn’t work - I thought it was over but then another light started coming up frm the horizon (7:35pm) and before I knew it another line was forming, coming our way.  This is what I was able to capture.  I had frequent pauses and panic trying to work the cell phone.  I got a really good look at one orb-bulb.  It was almost like I could see into it.  My mother was with me and witnessed everything.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Tiny spherical object with a single white light.;2019-04-11 03:20:00;2 minutes;Tiny spherical object with a single white light. Was peering out the window of my home at 3:20am as caffeine kept me up.  Saw a very bright light coming from the West end of the street.  The object got closer.  It was a white spherical shaped object, flying slowly above the street in between the houses.  It had one white light.  It was house level.  It passed right by me slowly, the size of a tennis ball.  No noise.  Might have been a drone.  Continued East.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Silver sphere (orb) sighting in Toronto (Leslieville);2019-04-25 08:05:00;3 seconds;Silver Sphere (Orb) Sighting in Toronto (Leslieville) My son - a VERY reliable and honest witness (age 11) - indicated he saw a silver sphere cruising across the sky from east to west at an approximate altitude of 40-50 feet (above the roof-line of semi-detached houses in the Leslieville neighborhood of Toronto, near Greenwood park.)   The size of the orb or silver sphere was estimated as about the size of a basketball with a reflective surface (as glimmers of the sun were perceived).  The sighting lasted 3 seconds, with the orb essentially cruising over Sawden avenue (Toronto).  None of the characteristics below apply.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Round white light illuminated in cloud cover, hovering and lining up vertically and horizontally.;2019-09-25 20:00:00;1 hour+;Round white light illuminated in cloud cover, hovering and lining up vertically and horizontally. There was a lot of cloud cover when we first saw them. Three of the five or six did different formations: sometimes lining up horizontally, and sometimes vertically. The other two or three skirted around the outside of them, drifting in and out of sight. One witness said it was probably floodlights from a stadium, but didn’t remain to watch their movement. Another two suggested it was God. But two of us remained on the veranda, looking west and watching an incredible light show. I had anticipated that when the clouds moved, that the orbs would become brighter, but as the clouds drifted, it was almost as if the orbs were shy, and followed the clouds in a southerly direction. We watched them for easily more than an hour.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Seems like a large star or planet, but when zoomed in on, looks like an eye looking around.  (NUFORC Note:  Venus??));2020-04-02 23:00:00;~2 hours;Seems like a large star or planet, but when zoomed in on, looks like an eye looking around. With the naked eye, the object looked like a very large star or a planet.  When zoomed in on a phone camera it looked like a sphere that was pivoting.  On the first sighting (April 2, 2020), it had one black dot that would move around sporadically as if it were looking around.  On the second sighting (April 5, 2020), everything was the same except there were multiple black dots that seemed as though they were looking around. The object itself didn't move, quickly at least, in space.  It just spun in place.  Each time, the placement in the sky (when I woke up later in the night to see) was in the same place as the moon would be in the sky at around 4:30.  I have videos of both sightings.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Very large sphere hovering in the sky and casting a deep orange light;2020-04-15 23:30:00;45 minutes (approximately;Very large sphere hovering in the sky and casting a deep orange light Just watched this very large round object hover in the sky for roughly half an hour. I was watching at 1130 pm from my balcony (19th floor) in mid-Toronto facing north west. This object, was not moving at all (perfectly still) but was emitting a deep orange light.  I’ve never seen anything like it.  I went back around midnight and it appeared to move further north. I stayed and watched it hover in one spot for another 10 minutes (approximately). Same orange light.  Went back around 12:30 and it’s gone. I have footage. I’m not one to jump to conclusions but am truly puzzled. I’ve seen aircraft, helicopters, and drones fly at night. I can say with a high degree of certainty  it was none of the three. At first, I thought it may have been a planet, but it was too close and the light coming from it was too strong. I’ve never in my life seen a “ufo” - I’m not saying that’s what this is, but can’t figure it out...;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
July 29th 2020 at 2:55 a.m.;2020-07-29 02:55:00;2 seconds;July 29th 2020 at 2:55 a.m. East York, Toronto Ontario. I was standing on my balcony having a smoke, and I was looking up and saw a rather large white ball streaking across the sky heading north with a clearly visible vapour trail in tow.  The white ball was about half the size of the Moon, it was flying lower than the altitude of a high-flying airliner, but it appeared considerably larger, and traveling at a speed which could only be matched by a very low flying fighter jet.  The object was white like a fully lit frosted light bulb. For me, it was an awesome sight!;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
