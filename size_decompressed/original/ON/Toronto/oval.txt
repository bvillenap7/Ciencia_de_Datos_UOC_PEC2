observed tarnished, oval shaped object with black symbols on side travelling south at a steady speed towards Lake Ontario;1972-10-15 08:30:00;seconds;observed tarnished, oval shaped object with black symbols on side travelling south at a steady speed towards Lake Ontario This sighting happened in Toronto, Ont. in the early 1970's. I was a teenager walking to school and for some unknown reason looked up into the sky infront of me towards the east. I saw an oval shaped UFO above the tree line, travelling at a steady speed going from north to south towards Lake Ontario. It was following the street ahead of me that was in the direction of north to south. The UFO was the color of tarnished silver and dented like a golf ball (but not as many dents).There was no lights or sound to it. The odd thing about this object was that there was a strip of black symbols on the mid front half portion on the facing side of it. I tried to read them but couldn't because they were not actual letter. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

Object over Lake Ontario - Toronto area     ((NUFORC Note:  Turns out to be blimp.  PD));2003-07-12 18:00:00;roughly 30 minutes;Object over Lake Ontario - Toronto area July 12, 2003  My wife and I were eating our dinner this evening at a restaurant at the corner of Renown Road and Dundas Street West (northwest corner - just about 1 block east of Kipling Avenue)in former Etobicoke, now part of Toronto.  We were sitting at a table facing an east window. I was sitting in a south direction.  The window was quite large and I was enjoying looking out the window in a southeast direction towards the lake.  Between 6 and 6:30 pm, I noticed in the distance, in this same southeast direction, over the lake a hot-air-balloon-type object or a blimp-shaped object.  Sometimes, it even looked eye-shaped or oval-shaped.  It didn't look a plane.  It caught my attention because it seemed to stay stationary for a number of minutes.  I asked my wife what she thought and she agreed that it didn't look like an airplane.  I was keeping an eye on it during our dinner conversation.  I noticed that it moved slowly eastward and out of view due to a southeast building a couple of times, then back into view.  Again it appeared to stay fairly stationary for a few more minutes.  Eventually, it moved westward out of my view.  I sent an email to the Toronto Island Airport this evening to find out if maybe there had been a slow-moving object over the lake towards the Etobicoke area of Toronto around this time, but I haven't received a reply.  It was dark black to silver colour against the clouds on the horizon.  It didn't appear to be a cloud because it was staying somewhat stationary.  The wind was gusty at the time. I could see the upper tree branches moving around Dundas Street West along with the clouds (they appeared to be moving south).  I'm not sure what it was, but it made the dinner conversation more interesting.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
I noticed a bright metallic object moving slowly from east to west;2003-09-21 13:00:00;15;At around 1 or 1:15 pm I was walking north along Spadina, just north of Queen Street, when I noticed a bright metallic object moving slowly from east to west. There was very little cloud cover and the sky was quite clear. There was a slight breeze, and cloud motion was generally from the north-east. I saw a jet plane pass quickly from north-west to south-east, leaving a con trail that passed through a wisp of cloud. The relatively slow speed of the object caught my attention. There was no exhaust and it's shape was round or globular - it was too small to be sure. There also appeared to be a very slight fluctuation in its brightness, as if it was rotating or wobbling. As I watched, it gradually slowed down until it was stationary. It remained in the clear sky for several minutes - I saw 3 other commercial jets fly by at different altitudes while I observed the object. It then began to drift very slowly to the west, and after a few minutes it stopping again. It was hard to determine size, but I think it appeared slightly smaller. Then it began slowly moving back towards the east, and over the next several minutes became a tiny bright dot. It was obviously rising as it was drifting. I began walking north, glancing upwards to see if it was still visible (it was), until I was nearly at Dundas.  I was convinced that I had seen a UFO. No plane or helicopter could have that shape or behave in the way this object had. Nor could a balloon have hovered or changed direction as the object had. The first object was still faintly visible when I noticed a bright red spherical object, about the same size and altitude, drifting in the same east-to-west direction. The appearance of this new object did not fluctuate, and it moved slowly and steadily without slowing or stopping. It looked like a balloon, almost making me doubt what I had seen before. Then I saw a low-flying jet pass quickly beneath and to the west of the red sphere, following a curved path from north-west to south-west. It was too low for a commercial jet, and it had the swept-back wings and twin fuselage engines of a fighter. It was also perfectly silent, and its underside had no markings and was painted so as to be almost invisible against the sky. Since all this took place over Spadina, I had a clear view. However, buildings prevented me from seeing where the plane came from or where it went, and I soon lost sight of the red sphere also. I vowed to never again go out without my camera!;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
2 V formations fly north along dufferin St. in toronto comprised of glowing oval shaped objects;2005-07-03 22:44:00;15 seconds;2 V formations fly north along dufferin St. in toronto comprised of glowing oval shaped objects Just before 10:43 pm  on Sunday July 03 2005, I was standing on my apartment balcony which is situated on the 14th floor of my apartment building at 919 dufferin st. Toronto. The sky was clear and some motion from above caught my eye. I noticed a formation of 9 or so Oval shaped objects flying in a V, completely silent. They had a very dim dirty white/yellowish glow. I couldn't believe my eyes. At 10:43 (according to my call cell phone call log) I called my uncle to report what I had seen. As I was on the phone describing the spectacle, I saw a large V flying towards me (headed north). From a distance It looked like a yellowish/white V but as it passed directly overtop of my perspective, I noticed that it was comprised of about 20-25 oval shaped objects exactly the same as those in the formation I had seen just minutes earlier. I was quite shocked and amazed. I coudln't make out any details beyond the fact that each of the objects was an oval giving off dim light that appeared to be a dirty white/yellowish color.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

It sounded muffled and steady. I ignored it though it sounded odd.  The sound continued and what was strange is that it the sound was steady.  It seemed to call my attention.  I continued to ignore it.  About 5 minutes later I decided to go to my window, pull the curtains and look.  What I saw was a black round craft hovering between my house and my neighbours' house.  I could see the craft clearly.  It seemed to be hovering right above the roofline of the two houses.  From my perspective I could see the bottom of the craft,  which had 3 distinct bright yet muted lights shaped in a triangle formation.  As I continued to look at the craft,  it moved over the roof and left my view.  I have since seen the exact same vehicle in a stephenville picture.

Saw 4 lights in a circular pattern, two changed colours several times;2011-05-21 01:30:00;15 minutes;Saw 4 lights in a circular pattern, two changed colours several times I was on my balcony, and I noticed a couple of flashing lights in the sky.  There are a handful of planes in the area, so I didn't think much of it.  The lights I saw didn't move though.  There were 4 lights all together, in a circle or oval shape - they may have be separate, but I don't know.  They all stayed still. of the 4 lights, 2 were changing colour.  They started yellow and then turned blue like a minute later.   I grabbed my cell (LG KEYBO) and tried to take a video, but nothing showed up.  I took two pictures, and you can sort of see it.  The changing lights were green then.  The others were white.  It's pretty noisy here, but it had a droning noise, like loooooooooooooooooooooo, not like a ghost or whatever, it was a deep drone.  The sound pulsed a few times, and the lights seemed to get a bit brigher, but I can't be sure.  I went to wake up my girlfriend, and we could see it from the bedroom window, but when we got out to the balcony, it was gone.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

Unidentified flying orange craft spotted in North York, Toronto, Canada.;2015-08-20 21:31:00;2 minutes;Unidentified flying orange craft spotted in North York, Toronto, Canada. August 20, 2015. Tonight, my wife and I have witnessed our first UFO sighting since we have started living in Canada. We live in North York, Toronto and we are very close to the Pearson International Airport. We see hundreds of airplanes flying over our heads on a daily basis. At around 21.31PM, we saw from the basement window an orange oval craft that was flying mid-air through the sky. We were surprised to see something flying at such a low altitude, and of such a distinct and luminous color. I promptly jumped off the couch and started following the orange light as it was moving left from my point of view.  I have followed the movement of the orange craft as long as I could before it went off sight, as I wasn’t able to look past my neighbors’ trees.  I started running upstairs and left my bungalow and, once in the driveway, I could still see the orange light moving towards the Goddard/Waterloo intersection (which is north from where my house is). The orange craft kept this very peculiar, almost fluid motion in the sky for about other 20 seconds. When I got closer to the Goddard Street/Waterloo Avenue intersection, I have noticed, as always, two airplanes flying in opposite directions.  One was on its way to landing at Pearson International Airport the other one, instead, had just taken off from the same airport.  In between them there still was the orange oval craft.  Compared to the two airplanes, it was pretty amazing to notice how the craft did not present any other lights that could possibly resemble an airplane or any other known aircraft. My wife was still able to see the orange craft from the driveway. The craft stood there for a few more seconds before it disappeared before our eyes in the dark, blue sky.  The other two airplanes were still following their trajectories.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Blurry, white oval craft and trailing red lights over Rogers (SkyDome) Centre, Toronto;2016-09-24 17:55:00;9 minutes;Blurry, white oval craft and trailing red lights over Rogers (SkyDome) Centre, Toronto On Saturday September 24 I attended the Blue Jays-Yankees baseball game with a friend in Toronto.  We looked up at the sky through the dome opening at about 5:55 p.m. and saw a white, fuzzy, slow- moving craft about three to four times as high as the Goodyear Blimp which was overhead for a lot of the game.  The blurry white craft reappeared about eight minutes later with five tiny red lights appearing in tow.  The tiny red lights seemed to flicker in and out of view quickly before all the lights disappeared.  My friend suggested parachutists but I’m not so sure, given the altitude of the lights and that no parachutists came into view.  Any word on what it might have been?;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
