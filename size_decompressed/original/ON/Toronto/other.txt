Sphere with Lion's Head Hatch lands - I'm swtiched off and lose time.;1975-07-01 16:00:00;1 or 2 hours?;Sphere with Lion's Head Hatch lands - I'm swtiched off and lose time. I had this experience back when I was a little girl of 8 or 9.  I went with the family next door to a lake just north of Toronto for a day of swimming.  The family consisted of a Mother, Father and two daughters.  I remember the car was a Duster. The incident happened on the way home.  There was some discussion between the parents whether or not to look for the object they had seen.  (I think one wanted to and the other did not.  Us kids really weren't paying attention yet.) We found the ship on the front yard to a farmhouse.  It had, I believe, 4 legs that were quite long (2 or 3 metres) with a sphere on top.  It was grey/metallic in colour.  The door/hatch was in the shape of (what looked like to me) a lions head. I saw the hatch start to open and the family start to get out.  The next thing I knew we were driving down the highway, singing to the radio as if nothing had happened. I always used to think of this a my encounter.  But since learning more about the phenomena of ufos (through programs such as Jeff Rense and reading Missing Time by Budd Hopkins) I now suspect that a member of the family I was with was/is an abductee and that I was simply switched off.  I don't know how much time is missing -- I was just a kid -- but it seemed to me at least an hour or two darker after the encounter than just before. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Hollow Ring Shaped Object During The Day, Just Above Tree Line;1979-06-15 17:00:00;1 minute;Hollow Ring Shaped Object During The Day, Just Above Tree Line I saw this as a kid and was more interested if anyone had ever seen a similar shaped UFO.  I was eight years old and my parents and I were visiting their friends, somewhere rural outside of Toronto.  Not exactly sure of where but it would have been in the GTA, summer, late in the afternoon. As the only kid there, I was told to go play outside. The backyard was a large grass area, with large trees( pines and such) and wooded areas around the perimeter of the property. Anyway, I saw a movement in the sky and looked up. Gliding through the air was a ring shaped object. Not a disk, more like a substantial wedding band, with tall sides but a hollow narrow body. There was no noise, no smoke, no vapor. It was moving quite slow and low, maybe twice the height of the tree line.  The outer side of the band was black and had little white dot lights on it, similar to an electronic score board.  The ring itself did not appear to be spinning, but the white dots seemed to be scrolling around  and changing their configuration, but nothing that I could read.  The little dot symbols seemed very simple, just randomly changing and moving around.  There was no discernible front or back. It just quietly glided past with nothing changing other than the dots.  I watched it quite calmly for about 30 seconds and then it went past the treeline and I couldn't see it anymore.I then went in to get everyone to come out to the front yard to see if we could still see it.  The adults weren't that interested in my rambling about a spaceship and when I went back outside, of course it had not reappeared. Being 8 at the time, I don't seem to have a good grasp of the size. I seem to recall it being small, maybe 15 to 15 feet across. I remember thinking that it had to have very small spacemen or that it was being controlled remotely, being that the shape didn't seem like anyone could be inside. But who knows, maybe it was bigger than I remember or maybe they were really really small, lol. Over the years I have wondered if it was some sort of remote controlled aircraft or weird balloon, etc. but it just doesn't seem plausible. It was definitely flying, with no noise, no vapor, no strings and looked like a simple band horizontally gliding above the trees. I thought I would put it out there to see if anyone has ever seen anything similar ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

red object flying low over Toronto at night;2002-08-05 22:29:00;2 secs;red object flying low over Toronto at night Shaped like the sole of a shoe, it crossed the night sky from west to east during darkness on a perfectly clear night (22:29. Aug 5/2002 in Toronto, Canada. It traveled along its length, unlike a bird. It seemed to be illuminated in red from below but there were no blinking lights. I first observed the object  directly overhead but it did not seem at all to be among the stars it seemed much lower. Though it was not streaking, there was no trail, the object went very rapidly, no more than 2 or 3 seconds and disappeared in the bright haze of the lower horizon in the ESE.  The trajectory seemed mostly straight although halfway through, the object seemed to adjust its course slightly. I'm a journalist, photographer, private pilot (lapsed) radio control airplane builder and flyer, amateur astronomer. I had been sitting outside for about 20 minutes, preparing for an evening of star gazing with my 10 inch telescope. I've been looking up at the sky during the day and during the night ever since I can remember (I'm aged 50). I was looking straight up at the stars when the object appeared. There had been occasional airplanes crossing my field of view shortly before and after (but not during) my sighting. This object was much lower and made no noise which I could hear. Although in a large built up city, the stars are still quite visible overhead. A few minutes later, when my wife joined me, we saw a small speck, a satellite go past the star Vega. As an astronomer I have observed satellites, man-made objects (ISS), comets and meteors moving through the night sky. This was like nothing I have ever seen before.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
I saw myself driving my car!;2004-01-21 12:00:00;10 seconds;I saw myself driving my car! Not a ufo but paranormal experience. Left work during my lunch hour and was in my car waiting to make a left turn at an intersection. Was waiting for an opening in the oncoming traffic to make the turn when I saw a car in front of me about to make a right turn which would be going in the same direction as me. It looked like my other car which my wife drives. Same make, color and year.  The opening came and I started to turn but decided to look at the Licence plate. It was my Licence plate!  In the two seconds I spent there making the turn and trying to slow down to take a look at the driver (cars honking behind me) I thought someone had stollen my car. I looked at the driver and I was startled. He saw me looking and he was startled. It was me in my other car! Wearing the same coat, hat and sunglasses as I was!  I was forced to complete the turn but franticly tried to make a right in the first driveway. Keeping my other self in view in the rearview mirror. I saw him/me halfway turned into the street. I was now in the driveway trying to turn the car around to chase myself. Constantly looking behind me and around as I turned the car so i wouldn't loose him. I dashed back onto the street but did not see him to the left. Looked to the right and no cars were in sight. So I figured he must have straightened out the car and not turned but went straight ahead. So I went back in that direction driving extremly fast for two intersections and could not find him.  I pulled over at a payphone and called my wife asking her where she parked the car. She told me she left it at the subway station as she takes the train downtown to work. I drove over there in less than 10 minutes and found the car parked exactly where she told me it was. I placed my hand on the hood and it was cold.  I saw my car and licence number and me in the driver seat. I'm not imagining this and I don't do drugs. Did my reality cross with some parralel universe?

dim  white light with centerless circles in a triangular formation all one craft silent and quick.;2004-02-04 20:30:00;30 seconds;dim  white light with centerless circles in a triangular formation all one craft silent and quick. I was standing on my front porch looking up at the Orions Belt constelation when I saw a light in the corner of my eyes. I thougt nothing of it at first and that it was just a plane. However when I focused on it, it was very strange. It appeared to be flying at a lower altitude than a commercial airplane would be flying and was completely silent and moving very quickly across the sky. It was three dim circles with no center ( white light) in a triangle formation appeared to be all one craft. It was much to quick and silent to be any plane as well as the lights were not of that that you would see on any regular aircraft. It definately was not a comet or any bird. It was very strange and interesting.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

It has bothered me since, trying to figure it out with reason.  It is the perfect shape of an octagon with sides being equal to the other.  It can't be the moon, not a reflection is it a planet?  I'm really perplexed.  Could you take a look at him and give me a verification.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

What looked at first like the average satellite made some abrupt turns before resuming its course northward.;2004-06-22 23:00:00;15 seconds;What looked at first like the average satellite made some abrupt turns before resuming its course northward. Firstly, sorry, I'm not only guessing the date, I'm also guessing the time - it could have been 22:00 or 24:00, I simply can't remember exactly.  I happened to be taking a break from household chores and stood outside the back door to my home. I glanced upwards at the stars and, directly above me, I saw what I thought must be a satellite moving in a northerly direction, but much faster than any satellite I've seen previously, perhaps three or four times as fast as I would normally expect. It had the appearance of a star, in magnitude about halfway between the brightness of Venus and the dimmest naked eye star. I continued to watch it and, to my surprise, after about five seconds the object made an abrupt wide turn to the left, turning enough to reverse its course momentarily and then turned back again. The turns weren't particularly smooth and there seemed to be a variation in speed, although I'm no longer sure about that. The object resumed a straight course at an even speed (same speed as at first sighting taking greater distance into account) about ten degrees to the right of its original course. When it reached about forty five degrees above the horizon I lost it in the city haze. Had I seen it at that point I again would have assumed that it was a satellite. I know what high flying aircraft look like. I've seen high altitude weather balloons during the day. I've seen birds flying high with city lights reflecting off their wings. I see meteors periodically. This looked like a satellite, other than the movement and the speed. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Large black low flying object with white and blue flashing lights.;2004-08-20 22:00:00;5-10 min;Large black low flying object with white and blue flashing lights. Hi, Last year, I, was leaving work at 10:pm with a work mate, we work at a golf club, we were walking down the garden path going toward the parking lot which is on the other side of the street.  It was a kind of foggy night and the sky was kind of gray.  As we were walking I, looked above my head as I, thought it was kind of dark and saw something very black above our heads I, asked my friend what it was and he didn't know, so we just kept talking until we got to the steps going across the street.  This black thing was further ahead and all I saw was a white and blue flashing light.  All we could see was black.  Could not tell size.  It was big.!!!   Wasn't until I, got to my car realized there was no sound.  Got in the car went down Steels Ave, and saw it again above the trees, still could not tell the size and no sound and didn't see any lights just a big black thing.

Metallic pill shaped object travels in westerly direction above Adelaide St  in dowtown Toronto.;2006-11-02 15:30:00;40 seconds;Metallic pill shaped object travels in westerly direction above Adelaide St  in dowtown Toronto. At approximatly 3:30 pm while conducting busines at First Canadian Place in downtown Toronto, my friend and I looked out the 32nd floor window from the north face of the office tower.  While taking in the scenery particularily Torontos' city hall we noticed this metallic pill shape object, hovering and stopping along an east to west route above Adelaide street.  It seemed as though as soon as we started to focus our attention longer on the object it suddenly dissapeared.   Later that afternoon we agreed we saw something but hoped it was some sort of new surveilance system rather than a UFO?   If my employer or peers heard mention of this since I work in the building it would most assuredly affect my future as an employee through the buildings management.

I have five photographs of a black pitchfork shaped object moving from top to bottom of  the moon with two vapor trails;2007-08-27 20:14:00;2 minutes;I have five photographs of a black pitchfork shaped object moving from top to bottom of  the moon with two vapor trails Aug. 27, 2007 at 8:14 p.m. I was preparing my camera equipment to record the eclipse scheduled for 4:51 a.m. on Aug. 28th 2007. As I was setting up my tripod in my solarium which faces southeast over Lake Ontario in Etobicoke, I looked up at the moon which was very “yellow” and noticed something “black” on the face of the moon. I asked my husband if he could see it from the livingroom where he was sitting and he said yes he could. I reached for his camera which was closest to me and had a 100-400mm lens on it to get a good look. I was amazed at what I saw! At the top of the moon but closer to the right side rather than the middle, there appeared to be a black pitchfork shaped object shooting downward toward the bottom of the moon leaving two stream vapour barrier in its trail. I was able to get about 5 shots in before the object reached the bottom of the moon and once leaving the light background of the moon it appears to be nothing more than a puff of black smoke. Upon reviewing the images I shot I realized that in one of the early shots I took of the moon the “pitchfork shape” was at the very edge of the moon prior to me being aware that it was there. At first I thought maybe this image was of a satellight that was set to record the eclipse but I have spoken to a few amature starwatchers and they agree that they have never seen anything like this. I would really appreciate learning what this object might be.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
A thin, jet stream like cloud appeared, along with stars that weren't previously visible.;2008-02-16 21:30:00;10 minutes;A thin, jet stream like cloud appeared, along with stars that weren't previously visible. As I walked my dog down the street, I could only see 3 or 4 stars in the sky, the moon (about ¾ full), but the rest was just blackness.  I walked back down the street and glanced back up at the sky at the base of the driveway. Still, only those few stars and the moon were out. I walked about 5 steps up my driveway, taking about 6 seconds to do so, and I happened to glance back up. Out of nowhere, a jet stream-like cloud (?) had appeared and the sky had opened up to reveal 20-30 more stars, including the full constellation of Orion. The whole sky had seemingly opened up with light from the moon (which seemed much brighter for some reason). The line passed across the sky horizontally, slightly curved and bended in some places, but tightly packed and not dispersing. I quickly realized that it was moving to the left, and it was moving quite quickly. I saw that the band of cloud was below Orion’s belt and moving slightly upwards as it continued to move to the left.  Within another minute or so, it was directly on the belt, and not more than a minute or two later, it was above the entire constellation, and still moving fast, not at all like anything I’d ever seen before. On the right, I could see the end of it clearly now, which was dispersing slightly. Looking to the left, I could see that it went on for some while in a solid line, bending here and there, but remaining entirely and completely tight and not spreading out or fading away like a normal jet stream would. I continued to watch it for another minute and tried to get a picture, but it didn’t come out, even with the use of a very strong flash. I saw that the line was starting to look a bit fuzzier than when I’d first glimpsed it, and the end of the line had passed over the house now, leaving all those bright glittering stars as the only things in the sky directly above my house. I walked out into the street for a better view and saw in the distance that the line was very fuzzy now, but somehow still remaining in a distinct squiggly fas! hion, li ke it’d only been blurred, not smudged or erased. I ran inside and tried to look out the back balcony and see if the cloud (or whatever it was) was still moving in the same direction. It was gone, the sky looked slightly fuzzier and not as clear and sharp as when I’d first looked up, but the stars that weren’t there 10 minutes ago were still twinkling shining brightly as ever.

I am on the East Mall, just south of Burnhamthorpe in Etobicoke, on the 18th floor.   My balcony faces East, and these UFO's were Southeast and I'd guess sighted at an angle of 50 degrees, which would put them maybe over Ontario Place?   By the time I got my binoculars, I could still see them and they both looked like airplanes approximately an eighth mile apart.   I got tired and stopped looking for a minute, then I didn't see them again.  The sun was very bright and their images really reflected as silver looking.  I watched the news, but nothing was mentioned about it.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
