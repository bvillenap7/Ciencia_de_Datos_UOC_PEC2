This object was transparent except its outline chevron shape;1997-09-15 20:00:00;5 min;This object was transparent except its outline chevron shape Hello my name is ((name deleted)) and i am the photographer who emailed you from toronto, this report will be about an experience some 6-8 yrs ago.  We were observing the night sky my brother, mother and father, and i it was about 9pm and dark in the city suburbs my parents were using binoculars while i pointed my 8 inch telescope around then one of my parents saw an object at what i estimate was 25-30,000 ft high but looked much larger that a 747 at the same altitude this i know because i enjoy watching planes pass with my large binoculars and this was much larger it was boomerang shaped and had the most amazing properties it was flying slower than a plane at comparable altitude as we all pointed our binoculars we were stunned to see that it was transparent with only the outline noticeable and kind of glowing i remember counting several points of light around the outside, the stars that passed behind the craft were momentarily magnified just like those convex rulers you pass over text on a sheet to magnify words.It flew in a scanning like pattern like it was surveying the ground and the incredible thing is that it flew in a grid pattern without actually turning itself it just changed direction yet its orientation remained the same it was at about 75 degrees between horizon and zenith (straight up)we watched it for about five min befor it continued away from us to the east and was lost maybe it went straight up but as it went away it grew fainter. My father is the ultimate skeptic and ill never forget the look on his face whe he knew that what he saw was unexplainable. He spent many moments in deep though no doubt trying to explain to himself but after several days i asked him and he said it must have been a weather baloon or something. I will never forget that thing because it was so vivid and defined that it could not be mistaken for any known man made object. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.
