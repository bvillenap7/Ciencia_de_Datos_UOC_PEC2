green light, toronto canada;1982-08-15 23:00:00;5 seconds;green light, toronto canada Date is a guess, but I figure the early eighties. Was home in my bedroom and couldn't sleep because it was a very humid summer night. Stood by the open window and looked at the night sky (north). I saw a very bright green circular object larger than the size of a full moon travel from S/E to N/W. This looked like a glow in the dark type of green. It was so bright that it left a green streek of light behind it.  I've seen shooting stars before but they were always pin points of light that quickly shot across the sky and burned up. This was huge and traveled much slower. My window was open and the object made no noise. The only thing I could think of was that it might be an meteor that graised off the atmosphere and skipped back into space. From what I understand if it was a meteor up close, it would be traveling faster then the speed of sound and I should have heard a sonic boom. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

bright round object zig zaging back and forth up and down over lake ontario canada side.;1997-09-25 02:00:00;15min;bright round object zig zaging back and forth up and down over lake ontario canada side. I was a skeptic before i had a very strange encounter along with some people that were also skeptics before IT happened. me and four other friends 2 of them had been close with me for several years and 2 of them were aqauntances. We were all going through school at the time (college) it was two in the morning and it was very clear that evening with i think an almost full moon high in the middle of the sky. We were standind on the North shore of Lake Ontario at bluffers park in scarborough Ont. our attention had been drawn up in the sky when 1 person in the group pointed out that she had seen what looked to me to be a planet had just appeared out of thin air. it was about moon level in the sky and it was a brilliant orange round object slightly larger than the largest visible star but was much brighter than any star i have ever seen. I know there is alot of air traffic in the t.o. area but i was sure no aircraft of earth origen that can zig zag back and forth up and down at the speed It was going it seemed almost to be playing in the entire sky above us. About after 10 min we saw a airplane i know this from wacthing many planes from the exact spot for many years. As the plane approached the vicinity of IT,IT stopped. Then at a very high rate of speed traveled toward the plane. One of my good friends then screamed oh my god it is gonna hit the plane. Just before IT did it proceded to do looping zig zaging motions around the plane then just as it had been playing before ITleft the plane and continued to play some more in the sky leaving the plane alone> at this point my hair was standing on the back of my head. We watched for the next 5 min or so the orange btright rond object dissaperar and reapear i know this because we saw a refletion of the light on the water which had been very calm and reflective. The light also apeared to dive frome about moon level in the sky down into the water several times and one witness also said that she thought she saw several other very tiny lights of the same orange coluo! r circel ing around and joining the light now i have poorer vision than she i know because i am suppused to ware glasses but she does not. I just found this web site and thought i cuold share this with others that think they are alone in there sightings and who are laughed at when trying to explain what they have seen without the fear of embaresement or ridicule please will someone respond?

reddish orange lights popping in and out of sky randomly all in different spots;1997-09-25 23:00:00;10-15 min;reddish orange lights popping in and out of sky randomly all in different spots for many years i have been wondering where to report such an event or even if I should. Well, for anyone out there who wants to know, one night, years ago I had been on the computer surfing the net with both my sister and brother. At the time, we were all adults- 20's and 30's.  I had been coming down the stairs from the second floor and looked out the big paladian window that faced south west.  I had been going slowly down and just gazing out that window when suddenly a reddish orangy light caught my eye.  I had seen it flash - disappear and reappear suddenly elsewhere but nearby. I thought I was seeing things so I stopped still and looked.  As I had been looking, my sister and brother came down and I told them to look outside.  We all looked and were silent, we saw more of these lights reappear then disappear at different points sort of like zig-zagging but disappearing. They were low down in the sky just above some treetops of the rouge river south.  I was amazed because I thought it might have been an airplane at first but no airplane could do these maneuvers all over the sky so quickly and randomly.  I don't know what it was to this day and neither do my sister and brother.  I know that there was someone who posted a message here in 2003 that sounds like what we saw.  This is amazing because now I can really beleive it was truly something else out there. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Light following/circles Aircraft;1998-08-20 23:00:00;several minutes;Light following/circles Aircraft It was approx. 23:00 on a week night in the last 2 weeks of Aug 98.  My wife and I were talking in bed.  In the dark I was watching the blinking of an Aircraft wing lights cross the sky.  We were in Scarbrough, our bedroom window faced North, the aircraft was eastbound.  The night sky was clear. I saw a light descend toward the aircraft at about a 120 degree angle then stopped directly above the flashing lights of the aircraft.  I told my wife and we sat up to see better.  The solid white light moved along with the aircraft for about a minute.  During this time I was describing to my wife how the light came down.  She was looking at the aircraft lights and the light I was talking about but not beleiving me.  It then done a back loop to go behind the aircraft and endup directly underneath the aircraft.  With that my wife became upset and begged me to stop watching and forget about the whole thing.  I was able to observe the light tagging along with the aircraft for about another minute before my view was obscured by buildings. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Then we realized that if you look with out blinking you would be able to see it move in small cirlces.The UFO was flying East-South. Every time a passeger plane flue by it the UFO seems to freez in one place. The UFO had some blue laser light above the craft and it looked like an anttena. From the leftside of the craft it had a short bright red beam. The UFO wasn't flying smoothly, it kind of moved liked a kite (back,forward,up and down). The blue light anttena started moving under the UFO and began moving higher until the light around it started to fade away.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

Strange bright light pops out of cloud, then back in, over Toronto Canada.;2002-07-04 23:10:00;10-15 secs.;Strange bright light pops out of cloud, then back in, over Toronto Canada. Thursday July 4/02, I had just finished playing hockey and was standing in the driveway of my neighbour who had done the driving.  It was approx 11:10pm.  We were chatting for a few minutes, when all of a sudden a very bright white light appeared in the sky across the street.  It was to the east of us and about 1/2 way up in the sky.  It looked like a large bright headlight.  I could see no structure behind the light. In the space of between 5 and 10 seconds the light moved out of a cloud, then did a sharp left and upward turn and went back into the cloud.  I was waiting for the light to reappear but it didn't.  We waited several minutes.  No light.  I said to my neighbour pointing What is that.  He saw the same light. For some reason I put this out of mind.  I knew it was unusual, but I couldn't account for what I had seen.  I never thought about it again, even while at Mufon.  It just seemed not too significant. If it was an airplane, there were no running lights on it. Then on July 15 I received an email from someone who lives the other side of Toronto from me.  I live in the west end, and the woman lives in the east end.  The woman said she, her husband and their son saw a brightly lit object to the west of them, on Thurs July 4 at approx 10:30pm.  She wanted to know if anyone else saw something strange that night. I'm trying to contact someone at Pearson International Airport, but so far haven't got through to the control tower.  There's a good chance they won't confirm my sighting.  I also want to see if I can find out how low the clouds were that night, because this thing just popped below the ceiling, and then retreated right back in.  My guess would be 5000 ft.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
White light shots across sky.;2002-10-20 23:30:00;seconds;White light shots across sky. Live in the west end of Toronto near High Park south of Bloor Street.  Sitting in my backyard having a cigarette.  Fairly clear night but it did cloud over after the sighting.  Glanced to the north and saw a bright light shoot straight down. Looked odd.  It coud have just been a really huge shooting star.  But I don't think it was. It looked liked a big bright white headlight of a car but it was in the sky and it did not have a tail like a meterorite.  Plus it was quite big and it looked to be at a low attitude. Much bigger than a shooting star. About the size of a small pea in the night sky.  Moved very fast - disappeared from view behind nieghbours rooftop.  From my vantage point the light appered to be falling straight down but it might have been shooting across the sky in a northerly direction. Don't know what it was.  Just saw it for a second. I thought that I would post this just in case anyone else saw something more that night as well.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
4 UFO's were flying in the sky, quickly from one place to another, one was dissapearing and re-appearing.;2003-05-22 23:00:00;1 hour;4 UFO's were flying in the sky, quickly from one place to another, one was dissapearing and re-appearing. Someone else and I were outside just outside on our balcony, relaxing. The other person with me looked up at something, or things in the sky. I looked up and saw 4 star-like small dots. One of them was changing colours, from blue to red. The 4 UFO's were in a group, and then broke up into different directions. I had my eye focused on 2 of the dots, and not really on the other 2, because the two I were looking at more often, were the ones moving more. One of the two i was focusing on, seemed to dissapear, and then re-appear somewhere close to where it had been last time. The other one was moving in quick jolts, side to side, up and down diagonally, basically any way possible. After a few minutes of moving they would stop for a few minutes, and then begin moving again. The sky was pitch black, with very few stars. The ones that were actually moving, and not dissapearing and reapearing, left a sort of gray haze behind them that would last for some seconds. Around each of the UFO's, was a light, a light brighter than the object, and it seemed to stretch out pretty far. The objects (excluding the one changing colours) were the same colour as stars, except one was much brighter than a star, and one was much dimmer than a star.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

I saw two star-like lights both twice in the same day. Once at 11am, than again at 8pm. At 11am, they were moving inconspicuously with the clouds, slightly moving back and forth around each other, moving East. Later at 8pm, they both re-appeared in the West, moving back and forth and up and down. They appeared with wish or /pre-dandelion plant-like objects, but I quickly noticed the far distance between the two, and thought that the ufos were trying to distract possible viewers. Than one of them increased in size and brightness, than a short time later reduced itself to its original size. A short time after that, they both disapeared into the East.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Three not particularly exciting events recounted just for the record:;2004-07-14 00:00:00;10 secs;Three not particularly exciting events recounted just for the record: I first submitted this in mid-July but for some reason it didn't appear on the database so here it is again (by the way, I enter 04 as the year but as soon as I tab to the next box it changes to 1904 I go back and change it to 2004 but it changes again. Mac OSX, Mozilla browser).  1. July 14 midnight Saw a dim satellite or other orbiting object travel from SW to NE overhead at typical satellite speed in a clear sky (clear for Toronto, that is). The only notable thing about this was that I couldn't match it to any entry on the Heavens-Above! website for satellite spotters. But it wouldn't surprise me if a lot of junk floating around up there isn't mentioned on that site.  2. July 14 0005 Saw another very dim 'satellite' overhead travelling northward. Average satellite speed, but still in a clear sky and just vanished after a couple of seconds (going northwards so it wasn't entering Earth's shadow). For ten or fifteen seconds after that a small dim point of light, same brightness, seemed to pop up for an instant in the same general area, then popped up again in a slightly different part of the sky (i.e. less than the palm of an outstretched hand). This happened seven or eight times and reminded me of an optometrist's test for blind spots. The flashes of light were so faint I have to admit to the possibility that my eyes were deceiving me, although I definitely saw the moving object that started the sequence off.  3. July 14 0010 Saw a brilliant spot of light (Venus x 2 in magnitude) travel from NE to SW, covering about the 60 degrees of sky visible between buildings and trees in a fraction of a second, seemingly at the same altitude. Possibly just a meteor or re-entering space junk, but notable for the fact that it was just slow enough to be seen as a point of light rather than a streak and also for the fact that it didn't leave even the hint of a trail as one might expect for such a bright light.  As I say, not particularly exciting but may correlate with information provided by others.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

Starlike, could have been satellite but doesn't match Heaven's Above info.;2005-07-08 23:59:00;1 minute;Starlike, could have been satellite but doesn't match Heaven's Above info. I was outside taking a look at what few stars were visible from downtown Toronto on a clearer night than most. I first spotted a slow-moving starlike object to the south west just before midnight at about 45 degrees up from the horizon moving towards me. I assumed it was a satellite although it was very bright (brighter than the dozen or so stars I could see) and was slower moving than most satellites I've seen. When directly overhead the light disappeared, as one would expect a satellite to do when moving into the earth's shadow. With my head bent back as far as it could go I had to wheel round to look for the object as it continued on its north-easterly heading. After a couple of seconds I saw a very dim light moving where I expected it to be and after a few more seconds the light disappeared again as it continued to head north-east in a straight line. When I checked the Heaven's Above website, the info given for the ISS, or any other object, satellite or booster for that matter, didn't match the criteria. The ISS was due over at that time but the course was different and it would have appeared at its highest point low in the sky, not directly overhead. Nothing very exciting - entering this sighting just for the record and I won't be offended if you don't post it.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

After watching the sky for about 10 minutes we saw something in the sky which was very small and it didnt have any lights.  The way we figured out that it wasn't from this planet object was because it was way to high for a plane.

It looked at first like two planes were flying directly at us because all we could see were two bright white lights.  These two white lights were traveling across the sky from the NW to the SE, one in front of the other remaining fairly constant as they traveled across the sky.  The light intensity varied slightly.  As the lights past to the south of us they rapidly faded out of sight.  There was no flashing lights or anything to indicate a plane, no streaking of light to indicate a shooting star. It was the most interesting encounter yet to be explained.  My wife and I watch planes fly over head ever night we have seen shooting stars in our backyard.

Light disappearing and re-appearing at different points in the sky over Pickering viewed from Toronto;2009-01-28 02:45:00;15 minutes;Light disappearing and re-appearing at different points in the sky over Pickering viewed from Toronto Before going to bed at approximately 2:45 am on January 28, 2009 (approx.), I noticed a light in the distance in the NE sky.  I live on the 17th floor of an apartment building.  My bedroom window faces east.  There are a series of condomiums at 30-35 floors each, approximately 10 km away in the east.  The light I saw was above the set of condominiums, although I believe the light was much further away and only appeared to be above the condos.  I first thought the light was an airplane, but understood that planes do not take-off or land at Pearson International Airport between early morning hours.  The light first moved to the south at a slow pace, then disappeared.  A second later, it would light up again, only it would appear further north.  My guess is it moved approximately 1 km north from the spot when the light went off a second earlier.  The light moved again in a slow speed to the north this time, turn off, and re-appear further to the south approximately a km away again.  The distance it moved is just my estimate.  This movement would randomly continue for 15 minutes.  Because I was in awe, and aware it was not anything familiar, I watched the entire event which lasted approximately 15 minutes.  The light finally dissipated for the last time and never re-appeared.  I google searched the event several days later, and found that a report was filed on a UFO website which described a sighting in the very same area and approximate time,  although the sighting was reported earlier in the evening.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Luminescent light above Toronto traveling east at astonishing speed.;2009-02-21 05:45:00;30 seconds;Luminescent light above Toronto traveling east at astonishing speed. Just got home from a late night at the casino.  Quickly checked e-mails and prepared to go to bed.  Still dark outside with no indication of sun rising yet.  I turned off my bedroom light and laid down on the bed, just before I closed my eyes, I saw a light in the sky.  My bed is right beside the window which faces east.  I have no curtains, and I live on the 17th floor of an apartment building.  Mind you, I filed a report one month ago.  I have to admit I have a more heightened awarness of the night sky now.   The view from my bedroom allows me to see the entire eastern night sky.  To redirect attention for a second, other than the last report I filed in Late January, I have had to other sightings, one in grade eight, and the other sometime in late highschool.   My first sighting was at a religious retreat in Orangeville, Ontario (1987).   All the boys slept in a large room with rows of beds either facing toward the inside wall or the outside window.  My bed was facing the large lengthy window.  It was approximately half an hour after the lights had been turned off (10 pm).  I noticed a green glowing, saucer shaped object hovering above the tree line approximately 300 meters away.  There was quite a bit of fog.   I watched it for a few seconds when I saw a beam of green light go down into the trees, that is when I woke everyone up to look at it.  Most were asleep.  Of the 25 classmates in the room, approximately five others witnessed it.   After about a minute, the green glowing object slowly disapated.   The second sighting occured while drving northbound on highway 404 heading toward Richmond Hill, a small town north of Toronto.  This occured sometime in 1993.   I was in the back, left seat of a friends car.  It was the middle of the day.  I looked up and saw a clearly orange triangular shaped object maybe 1 km high.  I pointed it out to my friends, but because of there position, they could not see it.  The driver had to focus on the road, as well.   It hovered for 30 seconds then shot directly st! raight u p at an astonishing speed and disappeared out of site. Now back to the latest sighting.  I quickly determined the light I was looking at was not a plane.  There were no flashing lights, and the light was almost luminescent.  The best I could describe it, as if it was floating across the sky.  The light was approximately a km in the sky.  I stood on my bed and watched the light, it quickly sped away at an alarming speed.   At this point I was convinced it was not a plane.  From the vantage point of my bedroom window, planes normally take approximatel 10 minutes to completely disappear out of sight.  This object not only sped away in less than thirty seconds, it followed an angle in the sky different from an airplane.  Airplanes follow a logical direction in the sky and approach the horizon at a slow and steady speed.   This object reached 'horizon level' in under 30 seconds.  Fighter planes could possibly move at those speeds, but this happened 5:45 in the morning with no sonic boom to be heard.

Light and object in the sky;2009-08-13 12:23:00;2 minutes;Light and object in the sky On august 13 at 12:23 pm, while I was looking at the sky from my balcony in Toronto, I took some pictures of the sky.  The first picture I took was to the north towards a cloud, I took a second one in a close up because I perceived that there was something moving inside.  In the third shoot I captured the presence of a light.  To the left (west), a plane was passing by.  At 12:25 pm, I again saw a light moving from north to east, and I shoot another picture.  I captured the light- object very clear in this sequence of pictures.  As I perceived its movement I took a close up. This one is a little bluer. Whatever phenomenon occurred in the sky was very interesting. I called Pearson Airport to ask what was flying at the time of my observation and pictures taken.  They called me back and said all that they had in their radar at that time (12:23pm) was a propeller aircraft that had passed a mile or two distance away from me.  Depart from Pearson Airport flying northwest to southeast.  I knew about the airplane because I saw it and had taken a picture of it.  The light remains a mystery.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

2-3 Large Bright White Lights observed over North Toronto;2009-08-31 01:00:00;2-5 mins.;2-3 Large Bright White Lights observed over North Toronto My mom and I were driving in her car in Thornhill, Ontario, when we came to a stoplight at an intersection. 	I looked up to the sky and noticed two quite bright expansive lights which were seemingly behind the clouds. Jokingly I mentioned they were UFO’s.  We both watched the lights for a while believing them to be airplanes passing through cloud cover, headlights reflecting on the clouds (although they were fairly close to each other).  The intersection was coming off a dead-end road and it was 1 in the morning, so it wasn’t busy.   These lights were quite large we watched them drift with the movement of the clouds, nearly matching its pace.  The light being emitted covered large spaces in both locations, though no craft could be detected.  The light’s intensity made it seem that it was too bright to be a star reflecting on the clouds, especially since it was visible in two different but close locations.  Less than 2 minutes of watching them their intensity began to fade until they disappeared, shortly after we noticed 1 either appear or reappear quite far away but in the direction tha! t the clouds/craft were moving.

Super large bright light moving at hypervelocity over Toronto;2010-02-20 18:15:00;1.5 seconds;Super large bright light moving at hypervelocity over Toronto My niece and I had just returned from grocery shopping.   As we parked our vehicle in our driveway and stepped out we both noticed an extraordinarily large bright light in the sky just below the cloud ceiling.  The size of the UFO/light in relation to distance in the sky was larger than several passenger airplanes combined. We were facing due south and we looked up – it was approximately at 120 degrees angle (if 90 degrees is zenith). The light was already moving extremely quick, far faster than any airplane.  The best description of how bright the light was relates to the science experiments done in school when burning magnesium.  This light was not a flare, was consistently bright, did not have a chemical trail and left no sound/wake. As soon as we noticed the single, very large, bright light, it took approximately 1.5 seconds and it moved due south at a high velocity.  Within that 1.5 seconds it had moved from our position we noted to a point in the horizon we could no longer see – it had in essence disappeared.  The best description of the velocity is similar to watching either star wars or star trek when the ship moves to hyperdrive/warp speed. Yet, there was no sonic boom typical of high velocity aircraft.  The time of the incident was 6:15 pm according to our cell phones.

'Star' close to The Plough fades to nothing;2010-07-28 23:00:00;8 seconds;'Star' close to The Plough fades to nothing I like to gaze at the small patch of sky visible from my backyard and I'm reasonably familiar with the star patterns as they change throughout the year.   Looking in the direction of The Plough I noticed a star in close proximity to that constellation, in a location where none would be seen.  It was approximately the same brightness as the stars comprising the Plough.   I watched it for about five seconds as it dawned on me that it can't be a star, whereupon it gradually faded to nothing, taking about another three seconds to do so.   I was hoping to see it move but it remained absolutely stationary for the whole time.   No big deal as sightings go, but I thought I'd commit it to posterity in case someone else saw it too and can provide more information.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
2 Bright Orb type craft seen moving in the direction of space then vanishing;2010-11-01 19:45:00;10 sec;2 Bright Orb type craft seen moving in the direction of space then vanishing I was in my backyard putting my wheelbarrow away and something caught my eye.  I looked up and saw a star shaped orb that was brighter than the stars in the sky.  It was probably several thousand feet above me, when it shot of in the direction of space and dissapered within a sec or two.  My friend was next to me at the time and I  informed him to look up because it was near the edge of my neighbors roof and just as he looked up it vanished before our eyes.  We both ran to the front of the house to confirm if it was really gone.  At this point my friend said to me Oh my god is that another one  I looked up and there was the same type of craft but this one was much nearer and directly above us and our view was not impeded.  I watched for a sec then ran into my home to call a family member and get my digital camera.  By the time I got back( I would say no more than 5 sec) it had vanished and my friend was white as a ghost and in disbelief.  I live in an area that i! s in the landing path of Pierson International airport and I have seen a variety of aircraft at a multitude of heights and I can honestly tell you this was no aircraft. I know the possibility of what I'm actually contemplating but their is no other plausible explanation to this.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

Object in orbit drops green and silver star over city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada at 5:30am then vanishes;2011-03-29 05:39:00;6-8 seconds;Object in orbit drops green and silver star over city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada at 5:30am then vanishes At 5 am this morning I went out to get some groceries.  On my way home I stopped to look up at the stars, like I always do.  While sitting there looking up I saw a fast moving flashing thing glowing between bright green and bright silver come shooting straight down from space and I knew right away it had landed somewhere in the USA because of its trajectory.  I was facing south, south west.  I was located in the neighborhood behind my apartment building facing SSWest.(more south than west) After the object fell I looked up to where it had originated from to see a bright light slowly close, or turn off.  It looked like a beam being turned off or a door closing or a ship leaving.  The object that came down was a lot slower than a shooting star but faster than anything I have ever seen.  It looked exactly like a triangular firework that you can launch yourself  bought from a store only it came from orbit and faster and it twinkled bright green and silver flickering.  No noise heard when it landed but it was way too far away to hear anyhow.  I know it landed I could just tell. It came from that light in orbit whatever it was. It came down in a straight line, what does that?   I know what I saw and I now know that we are NOT alone it is now impossible for me to believe we are alone, no way !!

Bright single white solid light/orb quietly flies across city sky at low altitude and extinguishes itself after passing over airplane.;2012-10-22 19:32:00;2 minutes;Bright single white solid light/orb quietly flies across city sky at low altitude and extinguishes itself after passing over airplane. I am an avid sky watcher, and On Monday October the 22nd 2012, in Toronto, Ontario Canada, I was looking to see if I could see any satellites with my bare eyes.  At 7:32 PM a low flying and bright solid orb-like light which was completely silent, and seemingly intelligently controlled, as it flew on a steady path at the altitude of the commercial planes which were in the sky at the time ( there were several planes for comparison, and they all had different colored blinking lights). The light was very brightly glowing solid white, and almost seemed to have a light blue tint or hue to it, much like a star.  It did not change in altitude or brightness.  It did not flash or flicker, or make a sound. This light was slow moving and did not appear to be attached any craft, but instead seemed to be the craft in its entirety.   It traveled from the South West across the city toward the North Eastern sky, at which point a small plane flew directly under the orb/light.  After they cross paths the light dimmed itself quickly and it appeared to disappear.  It did not reappear in my view.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

Bright White Light over eastern Toronto.;2013-09-01 03:00:00;04:00;Bright White Light over eastern Toronto. I took my dog to the park near my home early in the morning after I got off work in the very eastern part of Toronto.  The park is heavily forested where it is easy to the see the stars away from all the lights in the city.  At around 3:00 AM I noticed a bright white light that slowly but surely rose up from beyond the horizon looking East.  At first I thought it was a star but after looking at it carefully I noticed it moved higher in altitude but then it stopped.  The light was brighter than any other star in the sky, but to the average person it can easily be mistaken for a star.  I had a flashlight so I flashed it on and off 3 times toward the light in the sky.  I noticed it start moving a little while after I shun the flashlight.  This time I noticed it started moving toward me but still at a very slow pace, then it stopped again just hovering up there.  It had to be a few thousand feet up in the air and about 10-20 Km in distance from where I was.  It had no blinking lights, it also didn't make a sound.  It was not a plane, helicopter, star, comet, or satellite (I used my Sat App on my phone to check), it could have been drone for all I know but the fact is it was some sort of an unidentified flying object.  The light slowly eventually hovered so far high up I lost sight of it, plus there was a little cloud cover.  After going through my records I realized that this exact same light appeared in the sky last year around the exact same time of the year. I captured it on film roughly in the same location, altitude, and time, it appeared 8 out of 11 nights, the last sighting being on September 2nd, 2012.  I haven't seen it since until now almost a year later to the day.  It also always appears from beyond the horizon around 3-4 AM and it almost always slowly hovers its way up so high that you just lose sight of it.  I will go out tonight to see if I see it again.

8 Red Orb Lights over large City of Toronto.;2013-10-14 19:30:00;15-20 minutes;8 Red Orb Lights over large City of Toronto. In Toronto, Ontario Canada--On October 14th, at approximately 7:30pm, I was out walking my dogs.  Looking south towards Lake Ontario, I noticed approximately 8 very bright red orbs travelling in an upward motion.  I thought how weird. I have grown up around aircraft as my Cousin and my Uncle have been private pilots with their own planes.  Both of my cousins have worked for a huge airline for the past 18 and 35 years, respectively.  I knew planes don’t have red bright lights they have white lights, as I watch them all the time.  So as I walked south getting as much of a better view as possible, I tried to come up with a logical explanation.  I thought, could it be the Snowbird’s practicing at night with weird red lights?  The formation was so close together, with 2 stranglers coming up from the rear, I knew it was not average pilots.   Well, I know the Snowbird’s are out in Western Canada, so scratch that.  I then thought, maybe they are some type of Rescue Helicopters in training.   I am now running south, down the hill with my bulldog dragging me, I am going so fast all the while watching the Red Orb Formation.   I see a Gentleman out in front of a very exclusive Condo standing on the sidewalk staring at the Red Orbs.  I pull up beside the Man, and ask him if he thinks they are Rescue Helicopters.  The Man approximately 55 years old says, “So I am not crazy”?  I laughed and said no.  We watched together kind of dumb-founded.  All of a sudden a huge plane/jet with a white light (allowing us to see how big the jet was) flies so close and directly behind the Red Orbs, it completely blew us away.  I looked at the Gentleman, and we are clearly trying to process, so I say, “How insane was that Pilot”?  The Red lights remained on for a second or two more, and then in the snap of a finger ALL at the same time they were gone.  The Man starts yelling, ``Where are they?  Where did they go”?  We both discussed the fact that any aircraft is not allowed to turn there lights off, and even though it was dark out the lights from the City would have allowed us to see the outline of an aircraft.  There was NOTHING there.  In the blink of an eye they were gone.   I was then heartbroken as I did not video record it ! with my phone, and did not phone my son studying at home to look out t he window.  It was all too fast, too surreal, even though it probably lasted 15 to 20 minutes.   I ran home without even getting my neighbor`s name (we were not even thinking), with promises that we would run into each other soon. I called my cousin this morning, Oct. 15th, 2013.  It just so happened, that she was coming into Toronto International Airport heading up an Overseas Crew, at the same time I saw the red orbs.  She landed at approximately 7:30pm, on Oct. 14th, 2013.  There were Emergency Ground Crews all over the runways.  This is highly unusual.  She had not been notified that there was any landing emergency, nor an aircraft needing assistance on the ground.   She told me her flight would have been placed in a holding pattern or at the very least they would have been notified that there was a possible emergency.  She was not.  She has not noticed this in all her years of flying.   As soon as she can, she will be speaking to a pilot about this, and will be looking for the pilots she worked with after hearing my story.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Replicating, teleporting lights above Toronto;2014-01-25 23:00:00;15 minutes;Replicating, teleporting lights above Toronto It was around 11pm, something like the 25th of January 2014, when I got this weird feeling and looked out my window in Brampton, Ontario, and saw 2 lights in the sky to the north east. I would put them around 80-100 miles away and varying in altitude. What I saw was 2 orbish lights at various altitudes, bright pure white, but at the same time a reddish blue hue.  They remained pretty much stationary but hovered around for a few minutes not doing anything.  As I'm looking at one I see one orb slowly divide into two and move apart.  Then I saw the light that was lowest in altitude,  I don't know how to describe this but sort of teleported above the other two lights moving several miles in a split second leaving a streak of red light.   I went to grab my phone to take video and when i came back it was gone.  That is the summary of my second significant ufo sighting.

One small, one large deep red light fading on and off following one another closely in a circle around the city of Toronto.;2015-07-26 22:20:00;5-7 minutes;One small, one large deep red light fading on and off following one another closely in a circle around the city of Toronto. I’d like to document a sighting last night that I believe is highly unusual.  I’d be curious to know if anyone else has written in to you about this as well, confirming the highly strange characteristics of this sighting. Below are 3 pictures attached to better illustrate the sighting:   1.  Google Maps image of the rooftop location where my friend and I were standing, in Yorkville area of Toronto, very much in the centre of the city, corner of Avenue Rd and Davenport, facing the east initially, where we first noticed the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon. 2.  iPhone 5s image of the direction the UAP was first noticed.  Unfortunately, I did not have my phone with me at the initial moment of the sighting but went down to get it.  Once I returned it had already disappeared into an Easterly direction, the same from where we first noticed it. 3.  Image of an airplane passing overhead as a contrast-reference point.  I am facing West in this photo and the plane is flying East.  One can clearly see, even on the wide-angle lens of the iPhone 5s, the flashing lights of the plane as well as the plane’s outline.  I want to contrast the flashing red light brightness, color, and size of the plane’s lights to the lights we witnessed.  1. image002.png  2. image004.jpg  3.image006.jpg  At approximately 10:15pm Sunday evening, July 26th my friend and I came up to my rooftop to have desert and watch the sky. As I sat down at the table placing the fruit bowl down, Alison was looking East and brought the bright red light to my attention. Flying from the eastern sky from my rooftop in a northernly direction were 2 objects with very large red lights. What was different about these two objects were the lights, initially. There was only one color and one light on the flying object unlike the airplanes passing overhead, which at that time the sky was very busy with air traffic compared to most evenings.  The red light was a much deeper, denser, fuller red than the airplanes passing by. It did not have a flash-like quality as I’d normally describe the airplane light flashing on and off, but was more like a slower turn-on, turn off characteristic to it, like a fade-up and down, rather than an abrupt flash on and off.  As seen in photo 3, I took a shot of a passing plane with red light flashing on its left wing. I’d describe this as a flash on and flash off, and very bright. The plane is low enough to see its wings as well, as it flies in an easterly direction over my rooftop, ascending as it flies east. My guess is that this plane is 2000 feet high.  By contrast, the UAP was first noticed in the Eastern sky flying North. There were two of them. One was either smaller, just in front of the larger red light, or it was moving parallel to the larger red light but further away in the distance, thus appearing smaller. The small red light on the first craft, which initially made me think it was a lot farther away, had a red light slightly larger than the one on the plane flying over my rooftop even though I’d guess it was flying 5000 feet high and many kilometres away. The larger red light, which flew slightly behind the first one, was perhaps the size of the 2 lights on the plane or more. Maybe three or four lights together in size if we use the plane as a cross reference. The red color was slightly deeper, darker in color to the red arrow I have drawn on the photo. It was a red that was rich, deep, and somehow different to light on a plane, which always seem to have white as the base, no matter if red, blue, or green. No othe! r flashing or pulsing color was visible, like on an airplane. One light, deep red, and with a slow on and off quality, not like the flashing quality of the airplanes. There were also a few moments where the on-off quality of the red light was irregular, as if disappearing altogether and then appearing on the same path in the sky but farther ahead.  As the two objects flew North, it looked like the smaller one continued north and the larger one turned left sharply or towards the west. The curve in my arrow in picture 2 is close to where the object banked a strong left turn. The smaller red light in front seemed to continue north but it disappeared from our vision. As the larger red light made its sharp turn, it sort of did an zig-zag move, or an “S” shape turn before continuing north of the city but in a westerly direction. Also within seconds of that “S” shaped turn, I noticed a very bright white-blue flash in the sky in the North, not much more than 1/2 inch distance in the sky from the rd light. It resembled a jet coming in for a landing with bright headlight on, but additionally, this bright flash seemed to me to be larger in an up/down size than wide, like a slit of some sort but it was extremely fast in its flash with no lingering quality.  As the larger red light continued towards the west, approximately under the Big Dipper now, we noticed that the little red light was there again, just slightly in front. We commented on how it could have reached and caught up to the large red light since they seemed to veer off in different directions at the point in photo 2 where the large red light made its turn from the northeast towards the west. It just appeared. This time it was moving ever so slightly in front of the larger red light as they were now heading south but in the western sky from my rooftop vantage point, which for people from Toronto would be in the direction of the International airport now. They were moving at a speed faster than the jets flying overhead, perhaps twice the speed as the jets were coming in and taking off from Pearson International Airport to the west of the city from my location.  As the 2 red lights continued south they again banked left or towards the east, as if doing a large circle around the city perimeter. As we looked to the south sky as the small and large red lights made their way east, the angle or distance between the 2 red lights gave the appearance as if they were almost touching, with no space between them. At that point I ran downstairs for my iPhone but when I came back up, they disappeared into the eastern sky where we first noticed them. I looked at my watch and it was 10:27pm. Perhaps 5 to 7 minutes later than when we first saw them.  I go up to my rooftop almost every evening to observe the sky, sometimes with my star chart to see where the different planets are or even the ISS passing overhead, which I have photographed on my iPhone. In all the years I have been living here and observing the plane routes and stars overhead, I have never seen red lights on a craft of that kind before, ever. Thus this report and the curiosity to know if other sightings from Toronto were  reported about 2 deep red lights circling the city from a 7 to 15 km radius of the centre of the city where I was located.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Large red and small deep red lights circle around the circumference of Toronto, Canada.;2015-07-26 23:15:00;5-8 minutes;Large red and small deep red lights circle around the circumference of Toronto, Canada. At approximately 10:15pm Sunday evening, July 26th, 2015, my friend and I came up to my rooftop to have dessert and watch the sky.  As I sat down at the table, my friend was looking East and brought to my attention an unusually bright, red light.  Flying from the eastern sky from my rooftop perspective in downtown Toronto in a northerly direction were 2 objects with very large red lights.  What was different about these two objects were the lights, initially.  There was only one color and one light on the flying object unlike the airplanes passing overhead, which at that time the sky was very busy with air traffic compared to most evenings. The red light was a much deeper, denser, fuller red than the airplanes passing by.  It did not have a flashing or strobe-like quality as I’d normally describe the airplane light flashing on and off.  It was more like a slower turn-on, turn off quality to it, like a fade-up and down compared to the more abrupt flash on and off of the planes. The larger size red light was perhaps 4 to 6 times bigger than the plane lights overhead that were taking off in the distance from the West.  The smaller red light was around the size of a plane’s flashing light but at that distance I would guess it is larger, but only slightly. I could not determine if it was attached to a solid object or if it was just light.  My guess was that it may be attached to something but I could not see it at night, though the airplanes above the city can be seen unless they are extremely high.  I also should comment that there was a lot of energy in the air, as if there was a lot going on energetically in the city at that time whereas when the lights disappeared into the eastern sky, the buzz and activity overhead quieted down to a normal Sunday night feeling for 10:30pm. There were lots of planes passing overhead with red lights flashing on their left wings.  This was the usual flight path I see nightly. I’d describe this as a flash on and flash off, and very bright.  Bright because it seems like a white light beneath a red casing, like on a police car.  The red of the 2 unknown lights didn’t have that quality.  They were a much deeper, saturated red without white in the brightness of it. The planes overhead range in altitude between 2000 ft for the smaller craft and 5-10 thousand and much higher for the commercial jets.  By contrast, the UAP was first noticed in the Eastern sky flying North at approx 5-7 thousand feet.  There were two of them.  One was either smaller, just in front of the larger red light, or it was moving parallel to the larger red light but farther away in the distance, thus appearing smaller.  The small red light on the first craft, which initially made me think it was a lot farther away, had a red light slightly larger than the one on the plane flying over my rooftop even though I’d guess it was flying 5000 feet high and about 5-10 kilometers away.  The larger red light, which flew slightly behind the first one, was perhaps the size of the 4 or more lights on the plane. No other flashing or pulsing color was visible, like on an airplane.  One light, deep red, and with a slow on and off quality, not like the strobing quality of the airplanes.  There were also a few moments where the on-off quality of the red light was irregular, as if disappearing altogether and then appearing on the same path in the sky but farther ahead.  In the darkness of the evening and the distance from where I observed the lights, I could not determine if the lights were attached to a solid craft or not. As the two objects flew North, it looked like the smaller one continued north and the larger one turned left sharply towards the west.  The object banked a very strong left turn. The smaller red light in front seemed to continue north for a few seconds, but it then disappeared from our vision.  As the larger red light made its sharp turn, it sort of did a zig-zag move, or an “S” shape turn before continuing north of the city but in a westerly direction.  Also within seconds of that “S” shaped turn, I noticed a very bright white- blue flash in the sky in the North, not much more than 1/2 inch distance in the sky from the red light.  This bright flash seemed to me to be larger in an up/down size than wide, resembling a slit of some sort but it was extremely fast in its flash with no lingering quality.  I assume it was a meteorite. As the larger red light continued towards the west in the sky north of the city approximately under the Big Dipper now, we noticed that the little red light was there again, just slightly in front.  We questioned one another about how it could have reached and caught up to the large red light since they seemed to veer off in different directions at the point in photo 2 where the large red light made its turn from the northeast towards the west.  The little red light just appeared.  This time it was moving ever so slightly in front of the larger red light as they were now heading south but in the western sky from my rooftop vantage point, which for people from Toronto would be in the direction of the International airport now.  They were moving at a speed faster than the jets flying overhead, perhaps twice the speed as the jets were coming in and taking off from Pearson International Airport to the west of the city from my location. As the 2 red lights continued south they again banked left or towards the east, as if doing a large circle around the city perimeter.  As we looked to the south sky as the small and large red lights made their way east, the angle or distance between the 2 red lights gave the appearance as if they were almost touching, with no space between them.  At that point I ran downstairs to my condo for my camera but when I came back up, they disappeared into the eastern sky where we first noticed them.  I looked at my watch and it was 10:27pm. Perhaps 5-8 minutes later than when we first saw them. I go up to my rooftop almost every evening to observe the sky, sometimes with my star chart to see where the different planets are or even the satellites passing overhead, which I have photographed on my iPhone.  In all the years I have been living here and observing the plane routes and stars overhead, I have never seen red lights of that kind on a craft before.  Thus this report and the curiosity to know if other sightings from Toronto were reported about 2 deep red lights circling the city from a 5 to 10 km radius of the center of the city where I was located.  By chance, a friend who lives by Lake Ontario in Toronto told me he was walking his dog and many people by the beach commented on seeing red lights as well. Assuming Toronto is roughly 25 miles in diameter the distance traveled would be a circle of the city = 157 miles. If 15 min. it would be 628 miles per hour. If 10 min it would be 924 mph., which would have given off a sonic boom if it was a conventional aircraft. As it was closer to a 5 – 7 minute sighting, that would make it between 1386 and 1617mph. I don’t believe it was that fast. Perhaps the circle circumference was a tighter diameter. Assuming a tighter diameter (20 Miles) for the circle circumference = 125 miles a 15 min trip = 500 mph 10 min = 750 mph which is right around the speed of sound but still under. At 6 min and 20 mile diameter speed = 1250 mph I guessed the speed to be twice or more times the speed of the jets flying in all directions overhead. And that is my red light sighting.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
At least 10 blinking lights over Toronto, Canada... and 2 stopped in mid air, on a clouded night. ((anonymous report));2016-12-30 01:30:00;5 minutes;At least 10 blinking lights over Toronto, Canada... and 2 stopped in mid air, on a clouded night. At 1:30AM, Dec. 30, 2016.  Over downtown Toronto, Canada...  I spotted at least 10 UFO blinking lights noiselessly cruising at a constant speed in random order (some closer to each other than others) in the same NE direction above and in-between the clouds. At least 2 of them stopped behind in mid air.  They all looked like distant stars, but slightly bigger (1.3X).  No body was discernible except for round powerful twinkling lights.  (I did take a fuzzy  picture of one of the lights).   Shortly afterwards, I could see a noisy plane (military?) with a very intense nose head light that went combing through the underbelly of the clouds.  And after this, the sky became complete clouded over.   Wild night in the skies! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

A very bright yellow light keeps appearing in the same location in Toronto's sky, stays still and disappears;2020-03-05 20:30:00;3;A very bright yellow light keeps appearing in the same location in Toronto's sky, stays still and disappears A very bright yellow light has been appearing in the sky in the same location (above a building across) since this afternoon.  It stays still in the air without any movement and sometimes disappear in its place and sometimes slowly flies away towards north. I noticed this for more than 5 times during the past 3hours.  Once two helicopters flew towards it and it suddenly flew away from that location.  The light is steady, no blinking.  I've got a short video of it if that helps.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
Saw multiple (15) lights following eachother on the same trajectory.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-04-10 22:00:00;15 min;Saw multiple(15) lights following eachother on the same trajectory.  Two more came from different directions and one huge light stayed Last night I was in my yard with my boyfriend having a smoke, when I saw lights moving through the sky. They seemed evenly spaced apart  following each other. They disappeared  behind a tree and didn't seem to come out the other side. We counted about 15 of them. Right after the last one past on the same trajectory another one came from a different direction and seemed to follow. Seconds later, a second light came from another direction and disappeared in the same direction but different trajectory. We were freaked so we looked out our front window and saw a REALY big light. It might have been a star because its movement was really slow but it gave me pause because it looked close and bright. Way bigger and closer then the string of lights and the two that followed. I didn't have my camera in my yard but I did briefly film the big light. It is noticeably different then the stars, as no other star showed up on camera.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

Fleet of UFO’s.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-03 22:05:00;15-20 minutes;Fleet of UFO’s Came from the west heading east, and then disappeared upward.  Multiple crafts coming from the same location, going in the same direction.  Thought maybe it was a satellite until I saw a 2nd, and then a 3rd, and so on.  Wish I kept track.  After the last one appeared, a jet flashing red and blue lights followed the same path behind them.  Very high altitude..;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
