They came in from the SSE and were heading NNW. I couldn't be exact about the height but it is a very clear night and there were a few light altocumulus clouds so I'm guessing that they were anywhere from 7500 feet upward but I can't say for sure because I have no clue as to their actual dimensions. When the first one appeared I was confused as to wether it was a plane and as it grew closer I thought they might just be balloons but then I relaise that it wasn't light reflecting of the balloons but infact light moving in a circular motion probably around the edges of the craft. There was a light haze around the craft probably caused by the lights refracting in the air around the craft. At times the circular motion changed to an elliptical one as though the craft had changed its angle of attack but it was definitely moving at a unifrom crusing speed with no erratic motion and a continous heading. Skeptical as I am, after it passed over my buliding and out of view I looked down and a second later saw the second one following just like a replay. I studied it to the best of my visual ability and I am confident that it was not in the shape of any aircraft that I am aware off. I am not under the influence of anything alcoholic or any kind of drug. I am a logical, sound person with a few hours of flying time under my belt and have always been skeptical of UFO's and am still skeptical of alien life forms investigating our world but I can say for sure that the craft I saw tonight is unidentifiable. One thing I know for certain is that the Toronto City Centre ATC and the Toronto Pearson ATC should definitely have seen it on radar.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
This is not the first time I have seen weird objects in the sky over Toronto, but this one was the best yet....;2002-07-11 21:30:00;10 minutes;This is not the first time I have seen weird objects in the sky over Toronto, but this one was the best yet.... It was in the evening of July 11 2002 and I was on my home from a soccer game, I stood on a street corner and waited for the bus. At around 9:30pm I looked up in the sky and noticed a really bright ball of light, it was a craft I was sure of that but it was too large to be any type of aircraft or helicopter. It had two flashing lights one on the top and one on the bottom of the craft. The brightness of the craft could have been mistaken for a plane as the main direction of the light was facing west to east, (the way you would see the headlines of a plane.) but the craft was heading north to south at a really slow speed. The size of the craft even though high in the sky seemed to change shape, when I first saw it, it was shaped like an oval, but after a few minutes in turned into a cigar and then back into a on oval. I was able to watch it for almost ten minutes because of its slow speed, but then it went behind a tall building and a group of trees, I waited patiently for it to appear on the other side of the building but it never happened, after about 2 minutes I realized the occupants of the craft must have detected a believer had spotted them and took off...;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

They appeared to be about the size of the moon (or slightly larger) and were visable through a light cloud cover.

Four faint, moving lights and one chevron-shaped object seen in Scarborough, Canada;2011-11-23 20:00:00;40 minutes;Four faint, moving lights and one chevron-shaped object seen in Scarborough, Canada Between 7pm and 7:45pm Toronto time, my brother, my sister, a family friend and myself witnessed four objects in the night sky over Scarborough Ontario. The first object was shaped like an upside down V, had three lights and was the brightest.  The other three objects were very faint, however we could tell that the colour of these objects alternated between white, orange and red. All four objects were observed to hover for periods of time, then move vertically back and forth, then horizontally, then in circular motions.  One object we observed shot across the sky from one location to another at a speed that seemed almost effortless. One object, a bright ball, appeared and sped across the sky, then disappeared. It was bright white. We returned indoors after we witnessed this activity.  I returned outside, but I could not locate the objects. I would be most interested to have corroboration of this sighting from other people in the Toronto area.  As the lights were very faint and, by appearance, very high, I would suspect other people in the region of south-western Ontario may have also seen them.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511

Each balloon-shaped object was approximately 4 times the size of the lead object.  All object were white lights headed in a NNE direction higher than a passenger plane flying at about 30,000 feet.   Before disappearing in the horizon, the balloon shaped objects appeared to come along side the lead object then fell back in line behind it.;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
changed shape wings came out.;2014-07-26 20:00:00;1 + hours;Changed shape wings came out. We have been observing what seemed to be just some kind of craft very high up not moving.  Then, another craft came we thought it was a helcopter.  It was moving then the first craft also began moing both swooping in our direction wings came out we for a moment thought they were birds then lights came on the wings they then swooped back up the second craft disappeared but now it is back they are far  apart from each other not moving but lights seem to be going around the craft we have been observing this for almost 2 hours.  unfortunately we do not have binoculars they are to the south;43.6771451535591;-79.4107445992511
