Unidentified Flying Triangle, Ontario Canada.;1990-01-15 22:00:00;10 minutes;Unidentified Flying Triangle, Ontario Canada. It was 10 years ago and I was then 11 years old.  My father, my hockey coach and a fellow player were driving home from a tourny in Deseronto, Ontario at about 10:00pm.  We were driving west on the 401 when we noticed a VERY bright light off in the distance.  We made a game out of it, trying to guess what it was.  It was very bright and white.  We guessed a radio tower at first, then, as we neared decided it was far too bright.  Next we guessed a plane - again, it was too bright and we could not see any strobes.  For about 8 minutes we tried to guess as we drove closer and closer to the object. Finally, after nearly 10 minutes, we closed in on the object and it flew past us.  It was triangular and had four lights - all of them white.  There was a white non-strobing light on each top with a large circular light in the very center that was very, very bright.  This must have been the light we were trying to identify only moments earlier.  The object made no sound as it passed by at an estimated 500ft or so from the ground.  It was moving east, past us. My friend and I, being younger childern, became quite upset and my father pulled the car over after voicing a what the hell was that?.   My young friend and I watched as the aircraft flew past and crossed over the highway.  We thought it was coming back around so we both screamed for my father to get back on the road, nearly in tears.  We were quite frightened. I am now a certified private pilot so I am familar with aircraft lighting and identification.  Based on my experience with this subject I can say that what we witnessed that night was not an aircraft.  I don't know what it was.;44.1969;-77.0345
