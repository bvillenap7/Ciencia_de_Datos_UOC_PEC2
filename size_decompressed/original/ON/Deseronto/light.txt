Have been doing this for over 6 years. Initially witnessed a single slow low light amber coloured strobe (approx every 15 seconds) at high elevation headed due east then approx. 1 minute later, I obs a very bright clear white flash from high elevation flying over head going due north.  The light dimmed, and approx 30 seconds later, another bright white flash and this pattern repeated as it continued north.   At no time did I hear any sounds until an airplane headed east at a lower altitude passed.;44.1969;-77.0345
