23 white lights evenly spaced flying in a row flying over Lake Ontario. ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-24 05:15:00;3-4 minuites;23 white lights evenly spaced flying in a row flying over Lake Ontario in a 3-4 mins span This is a regular early morning walk near our lake with my coffee on weekends around 5am each morning, i know the area here lived all my life near here,across the lake i always see Toronto, CN tower , lights during day have watch many planes begin there decent across lake to land at Pearson Toronto Airport, This morning on my 5am walk,.over the lake across Toronto, was lower clouds, but just above the sky was clear i looked up scanning the sky admiring the stars,looked over to southeast where the moon was, could see the whole shape of moon but just at bottom of the moon was the thin light from it to be seen, beautiful.As i was standing for several minutes looking at the moon, it was then i thought  there is a white plane light going across the sky just above moon, but thats when i noticed another, then another, same speed, spaced almost evenly, so where i was standing the moon looked to be about 2 feet above in distance,the lights were about 4 inches above t! hat distance plain in comparison ,i was thinking ok these lights were planes going across lake ontario to land at Toronto Airport, but then i remember my wife telling me about the landing restrictions now in place from midnight till 6:30am ,now i'm thinking ok, what are these lights, why are they going about as fast as you see planes fly way up in sky watch day in flight, this low, but evenly spaced, thats when i then began counting, i was at 4 lights then i looked noticed it seemed to be a line of the lights evenly spaced from the west .could then count more was at about 8 ,i looked to see, where there were coming from sky there was a space of no lines of lights as it seemed as they would then become low enough to then become in my vision of sight, almost about a 45 degree angle coming down from above into my line of sight, all evenly about evenly spaced, again from where i stood watching,i extended my arm spaced my index finger and my little finger to show there spacing a! part as they moved across sky over the lake, now around counti! ng the 8 th light or so this next light seemed bigger not brighter light but almost triangle,or maybe almost like 3 lights made it look like a triangle too me, but NONE of these lights had any other colour lights,or flashing lights, there were just all white only, almost at if you could take a star and have them move at this speed and form a evenly spaced row flying across the sky above our lake,in total, i counted 23 separate lights in this 3- 4 minutes ,then i watched for for another 20 minutes or so, looking around the whole sky up at stars, did not see any more of this lights formation flying, i did see a Real plane fly over high above, i watched it as i wanted to get my bearing to compare its speed, to let me know it was like Real planes  fly,i watched many times over the years,also to kind of let my mind compare its speed to the lights i seen. It being a plane flying high above probably flying around 500 mph going to it destination , i have flown many times ,know they fly aroun! d that speed, i would say these lights were about that same speed, i wanted to get a comparison to something to try to understand, make sense of what i witnessed.I counted 23 single almost star brightness single white lights move across the lower sky, coming down from above, that was my visual number count from when i actually began looking in that direction of the sky, i'am not sure if there was any before i began the sightings ,this is what i seen only.;43.2001;-79.5663
Light streaking across sky;2020-11-06 22:30:00;2-3 minutes;Light streaking across sky Saw light going across the sky. Thought it was a shooting star or a meteor at first until it slowed down and eventually made small movements back and forth and also small circles. Another “light” appeared and was making the same type of movements in the same area. The lights eventually faded & disappeared after 2 to 3 minutes.;43.2001;-79.5663
