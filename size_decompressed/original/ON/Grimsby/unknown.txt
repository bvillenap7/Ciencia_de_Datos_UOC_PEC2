It is as bright as the brightest star out with a reddish tinge, on this clear night. It is in the same area of sky but moves slowly in all directions. Sometimes relatively straight... sometimes spirally... sometimes like a snake. It seems to be quite a ways up. I had never seen this before. It was a bit scarry at first. Then I got my Bushnell binoculars out but it just looked like a bigger, brighter dot in the sky through them. After watching for about 20 minutes, I decided to call my girlfriend.  We are both in out 40's {and sane!}. She lives in St. Catharines but it is too bright in the city to see any stars. We talked for about 1/2 hour and when we said good night to each other, it was still hovering around the same section of sky. This was quite an unexpected sight for me. I'm currious if any one else in Southern Ontario Canada noticed anything different in the sky this morning. I'm going out front again to see if it is still there. It is now 03:40.;43.2001;-79.5663
