Strange fly-strip-looking object floating over houses along Lake Ontario.;2007-02-09 17:30:00;1 minute;Strange fly-strip-looking object floating over houses along Lake Ontario. I was going south along the QEW highway in Niagara.  It was a clear day, but the lake was dark with a winter storm.  Once in a while I looked toward the lake to my left.  I saw something floating above some houses. I thought it was a kite at first, but as I peered through my window I saw that it was long, thin, and spiral in shape, brownish gold, and that it appeared to be hovering while the body of it just kept spiralling.  It looked a bit like one of those fly-catcher strips.  I looked around to see whether it was tethered somewhere, but saw nothing.  It appeared to be just floating there.  In size, considering its distance from me, I’d say it was about 4 to 5 meters tall. As it left my view the sunlight hit it and it really shone.  That’s the last I saw of it. It happened last week, but I haven’t told anyone, as it was such a silly looking thing, not exactly what one might expect to see floating still on a cold, blustery winter’s day.
