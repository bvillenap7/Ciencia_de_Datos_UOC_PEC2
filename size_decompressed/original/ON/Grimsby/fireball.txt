Two fireballs seen near Toronto slow and then rise straight up and dissappear.;2012-07-11 22:00:00;3-5 minutes;Two fireballs seen near Toronto slow and then rise straight up and dissappear. I was standing in our back yard at approximately 22:00 on Wednesday July 11, 2012 when I noticed a reddish light in the sky. At first I thought that it was an airplane, but as it approached from the east I noticed that the lights werenâ€™t blinking and there appeared to be only a very large reddish light. The object seemed to slow  considerably and then to rise straight up, as it did another identical object appeared lower on the horizon following the same general path.  I watched the first object fly straight up until it was no longer visible.  At this point I ran inside to get my husband. When we had both returned to the back yard, only about 15-20 seconds later we observed the second object getting closer, and then veering off to the north before it started its assent.  The second object did not go straight up. It had a more gradual assent, yet still at a very steep angle.   We at no time heard any noise that we thought could be coming from the objects, as you would hear from a helicopter or an airplane. We continued to watch the sky for another 15-20minutes but did not see any further sign of the objects. We did however see two airplanes which appeared farther away, and we could clearly see the blinking lights, and hear their engines.   We are accustomed to air traffic as two major airports are less than 100km from our location, and we have never before seen anything that looks or maneuvers like the objects we just witnessed.;43.2001;-79.5663
