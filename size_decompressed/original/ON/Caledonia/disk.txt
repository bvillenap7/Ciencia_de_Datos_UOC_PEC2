object was disk shaped, the size of a bus;2009-03-31 21:00:00;10 minutes;object was disk shaped, the size of a bus I was driving home from work, when I noticed a very bright object to my left just over the grand river. As I watched it , it appeared to me it was not a plane of any kind, I puled my car over to the side of the road and got out. The object was just hovering above the river about 300ft up, it made no noise and I became a bit frightened. Jumped back in my car, and it darted behind me and ended up on my right side. The object followed me at about 5000 ft until I reached the brantford city limits, and then it disappeared.
