It was a clear sky that day in the pictures it shows up perfectly as seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD));43.0649;-79.9359
Ball of light performs quick burn to attain higher altitude.;2019-09-24 21:00:00;1-2 minutes;Ball of light performs quick burn to attain higher altitude. Ball of light a little larger than a star flying from the south towards the North Star.  The night was clear and we could see all the stars.  I thought it was a satelight but the point of light was to big.  It was flying above 40 000 ft but lower than most satelights.  a large flash of light came from the object when it was directly overhead.  The speed of the object did not increase but the point of light started to get smaller as it headed North.  It looked like a space craft or a satelight did a quick burn to attain a higher altitude.  I checked for recent launches but found nothing on this date.;43.0649;-79.9359
