Oval shape, flying horizontally from East to West;2002-08-02 20:30:00;10 seconds;Oval shape, flying horizontally from East to West We were sitting outside at a cottage rental place, located beside a secondary highway, looking south.  As we were talking, I saw a brightly illuminated oval shape speed horizontally across the sky from East to West.  It then went behind a small stand of either spruce or pine, and didn't reappear on the other side.  The person I was talking to (we did not know each other), had seen it too.  We searched the sky, but didn't see it again.;45.6183;-79.4123
