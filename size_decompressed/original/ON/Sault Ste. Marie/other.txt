Flaming object;1976-07-15 16:00:00;3 seconds;Flaming object This occurred many years ago, the late 1970’s, during the summer months as that is when my family usually vacationed at our cabin in northern Ontario on Lake Achigan.  This area is very remote with dense forest and hills.   One afternoon around 4 or 5 o’clock I was taking our motor boat across the lake.  It was a beautiful day the sky was blue and cloudless.   For some reason I looked nearly straight up and saw a flaming ball disappear over a nearby hill.  It looked as though someone had taken a paper grocery bag, wadded it up, and set it on fire and thrown it.   I would guess it was about 500 feet up because I could see it so clearly with flames trailing behind and it disappeared behind an approximately 350 foot high hill.  I would guess it was travelling about 200 mph, but this is a very rough guess as it was so long ago.   It only lasted a few seconds, but even though it happened so many years ago I can still see it very clearly in my mind.  I don’t know ! if it made any noise or not since I was sitting right next to a running outboard motor.   I have no idea why I happened to pick that moment to look straight up perhaps I caught a glimpse of it out of the corner of my eye.   I still don’t know what to make of it I’ve never seen anything like it since.   That’s about it, for what it’s worth. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I witnessed a low-flying, flat and round, blue-lighted object travelling at a great speed.;2005-09-09 21:00:00;5 to 10 seconds;I witnessed a low-flying, flat and round, blue-lighted object travelling at a great speed. In between 20:30 and 21:30 on September 9th, 2005, 6 other people and I saw a strange object in the sky. We were facing south, towards the St. Mary's River, when a low-flying object, which appeared to be somewhat flat and round, flew quickly by. It flew extemely fast, and emitted a blue light. The light was an incredible bright blue, and it moved so fast that we only saw it for 5 to 10 seconds. There weren't many stars, and the sky was very dark. My friends thought it was a plane, but because I fly so much, I know that no plane travels that fast, or has a blue light. A few moments later, an actual plane (with it's blinking red and white lights) flew overhead at a MUCH slower speed.  I came to the conclusion then that this was a very unusual sighting.;46.5209434343434;-84.3287121212122
comet  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD));2007-12-10 19:43:00;2min;Around 7:30 pm my children came in the house and said that there friend showed them where the space station is in the sky.Being intrigued i put my boots on and went outside with my daughter who is seven.i looked around in the sky and saw nothing. She then told me that i had to climb to the top the snow hill to see it.i didn't feel like climbing the hill so we went inside. At 7:43we went outside to go and pick up my wife from work. as i looked at the southwest sky i saw a comet. i thought that this must be the comet that i was looking for in the eastern sky about a month ago. As watched this comet i realized that it was moving too fast to be a comet. i saw haley's comet when i was young and it was very stationary.i figured that i would look at it some more after picking up my wife from work but i could not locate it when we got home.
