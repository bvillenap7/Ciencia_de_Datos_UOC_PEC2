strange triagle;1991-09-21 23:00:00;3 min;strange triagle On the evening of September 21 1991 my cousine his father and I were standing in the back yard of my uncles sisters house looking up at the sky watching a meteor shower event.We were wright in the middle of town looking above a church when all of a sudden out of nowhere this triangular object appeared in the sky. The object was as black as the night sky and if we were not looking at that exact spot we would have never seen the object. The object was huge in size I would guess the size of a football field it had what appeared to be round circles at each point of the triangle.The circles appeared to be some sort of thrusters but made no sound what so ever,it was as if they were trying not to be seen.The perimeter of the triangle looked cylindrical in nature .The object came straight down for about 1 minute then glided forward for another minute or so then vanished. I think it was trying to avoid the meteor shower but who knows.;46.5209434343434;-84.3287121212122
The three lighted object hovered over us for a while, then glided across the night sky quietly until we could not see it anymore.;1996-06-20 02:00:00;10-15 seconds;The three lighted object hovered over us for a while, then glided across the night sky quietly until we could not see it anymore. My friend and I saw something in the sky that night we did not know what to make of it.  We saw three large balls of yellow/orange lights, which made the shape of a triangle up in the sky just above us.  This thing was so close to us. At first we thought that it might be a military plane of some sort but wondered why it was so quiet.  We could not hear any sound at all.  It hovered over us and then glided very slowly across the sky above us until we could not see it anymore it was moving in a north/westerly direction.   We spoke of it a few times after that but thought who could we report it to anyways. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));46.5209434343434;-84.3287121212122
