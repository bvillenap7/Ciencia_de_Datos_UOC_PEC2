Orange fireball over Sault Ste Marie;2014-07-01 22:30:00;2 minutes;Orange fireball over Sault Ste Marie On Tuesday, July 1st, at approx. 10:30pm, whilst over-nighting in Sault Ste. Marie, Canada, on a road trip from Minnesota to Montreal, my two teenage children and I were watching the local fireworks over the river separating the USA and Canada.  It was raining on and off with overcast skies.   During the fireworks, I looked off to the SW and noticed and orange light approaching.  As this got closer and easier to see, it appeared to be an orange/red fireball.  It was moving from SW to NE at what I’d describe as the speed of a light plane.   There was no noise and the object did not change shape and finally disappeared out of sight.   I’d estimate the height between 1700 to 2500 feet.  Whilst I was watching this, I told my kids to look in the direction I was as they were watching the fireworks and hadn’t noticed it yet.  I asked them, “What do you think that is”?    They both looked, turned to me with wide eyes, and both said, that’s the same thing we saw at home in August.   I posted a similar sighting on 8-26-13 of four of these things in Minnesota.  The first sighting still has me baffled and now I’m really intrigued.   These aren’t planes or lanterns.   After my first sighting I contacted the National Weather Service for wind directions which ruled out balloons etc.  I did get a couple of photos of the first sighting but not this one.;46.5209434343434;-84.3287121212122
