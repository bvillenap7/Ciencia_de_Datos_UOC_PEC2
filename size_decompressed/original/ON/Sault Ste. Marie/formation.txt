Line of blinking, hovering light formation above small northern community.;2015-08-19 01:45:00;30 minutes;Line of blinking, hovering light formation above small northern community. On this evening, I happened to look out my bedroom window because it was very cloudy and windy outside.  It was about 1:45 am and something unusual caught my eye.  A string of lights in a line formation in the sky, far enough up that I knew it could not be a helicopter, kite, or lantern.  The lights were hovering in a straight line, blinking and that's what made me realize this was not a plane or anything I have ever seen.   I am eighteen years old, and most people would not believe me, so I woke up my mother and made her come outside to see what I was seeing and she was in disbelief.  It was nothing she has ever seen before, she had no explanation.  We watched the lights for 20 minutes.   During these 20 minutes, the hovering line of blinking lights would slowly move into a diagonal formation, and when the clouds cleared up and made the formation more visible, you could see one of the lights almost look as if it was spinning.  There was also one red light that would a! ppear every now and then.  Eventually this formation of lights slowly began moving in a strange pattern up further into the sky.  The lights looked as if they moved in slightly different patterns and formations.  This is something we both can not explain.   Someone else in our city that is known to us, has a video of the same thing we saw, two nights ago, same time.  They sent in a report to this website.  Is something happening to our small city?;46.5209434343434;-84.3287121212122
