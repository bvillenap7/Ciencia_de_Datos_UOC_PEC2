7 or 8 Large Orange glowing UFOs Rise,make patterns,and race in our southern night sky.;2005-12-29 20:00:00;3-5 minutes;7 or 8 Large Orange glowing UFOs rise, make patterns, and race in our southern night sky. I saw 7 or 8 bright orange solid circles (looked like balls)?? UFO'S  Initially at about 815 pm, I looked in sky while closing curtins, I thought the bright star that is usually in our south view night sky, looked an orange colour. Then all of a sudden there were 2 orange ball shapes, about 10 sec later another appeared from below horison, they traveled up, stopped, one circled other, then 2 more came up, they made a square formation, then about every 10 to 20 seconds another orange ball appeared.  At one point there were 5 together still, then eventually they dispersed and either flew south or faded into sky. I DID TAKE PICTURES and called a neighbour,who also saw them, she also had company who saw. The pictures do not show the red ball shape, however some show the shape similar to that of a mosquito, within a smokey area.Other pictures show what looks like a swirlling of smoke. They appeared above trees of an island, which is on the Saint Marys River, where we live. You can see a night marker of the shipping channel, in pictures that show ufos, that marker is about 3 kilometers away. In photos they seem closer than the markers to our home. I went outside on deck and could not hear any noise from them. Our son told us on Dec 24 in evening, that he saw an orange Ball in sky same area also, however we did not get pictures of it. Across our waterway is a very sparcely populated area of USA Upper peninsula of Michigan;46.5209434343434;-84.3287121212122

Stationary, multicolored, circular moving lights, met by another object which raised to meet it and then it too displayed the lights.;2013-09-04 21:50:00;5 minutes;stationary, multicolored, circular moving lights, met by another object which raised to meet it and then it too displayed the lights. While closing up north facing bedroom window to set alarms before going to work, I was shocked to see a bright, red, green, blue, white type of circular object high in the sky.  It seemed to be far away, but low enough in sky for me to observe these lights moving in a circular motion giving the impression of a round shaped craft.  I stood and watched to see if it was moving away, up or down, or coming closer like an aircraft or helicopter.  However, it remained in exactly the same position and did not change size.   Within a few minutes my husband returned home and I screamed for him to come and see the object.  At that very moment another object appeared in the sky, below the multicolored one, but it appeared to be a star.  It slowly started to rise up towards the colored object and eventually was above it.  Then the star type object started to display the same circular flashing, multicolored lights.  We watched this continue for at least five minutes.  When I ran to! get my binoculars and camera, the objects disappeared.  My husband stated that they just faded away.  There were some clouds tonight, but not many, and it was a good clear view of the many stars in the sky, more than we've seen in a long time, living in the city.;46.5209434343434;-84.3287121212122
