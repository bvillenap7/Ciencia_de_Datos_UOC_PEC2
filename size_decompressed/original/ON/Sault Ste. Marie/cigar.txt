One silver cigar shaped object with no contrail and made no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellite.  PD));2004-06-10 09:15:00;1min 30sec;One silver cigar shaped object with no contrail and made no sound. Gazing almost directly overhead I observed an object slightly to the south, travelling in a straight horizontal direction from east to west.  I would estimate the object to be travelling at an altitude of 2km with a rate of speed simillar to that of a small airplane.  The object made no sound, had no lights, and had no contrail.  It's colour was white-ish/ silver and the sun did reflect off of it.  This was observed under a blue sky with zero cloud cover and no wind. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellite?
