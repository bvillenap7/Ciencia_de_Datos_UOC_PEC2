Brightly lit, horizon to horizon in 3 seconds, instantaneous acceleration, erratic random maneuvers.  Awesome!;2004-09-14 18:00:00;1 minute;Brightly lit, horizon to horizon in 3 seconds, instantaneous acceleration, erratic random maneuvers.  Awesome! I was standing on an open porch of a house (339 fifth Ave West, North Bay, Ontario) facing the street (northeast) at dusk (partly dark) with my friend  having a cigarette.  My brother at this time was in the house in a room directly behind where John and I were standing separated by a large window..  I was chatting with john (both of us facing east) when a brightly lit object flew/shoot directly overhead of us passed through several clouds and cleared the northeast horizon within about 2 seconds, leaving a light tracer similar to a shooting star. John and I had both seen this at the exact same time and turned to each other (still facing east). John said with a bewildered look on his face “I guess we just seen a shooting star ??”  About 5 seconds later what appeared to be the same object (with the same speed, light tracer and seemingly within the same flight path in reverse) came back from over the northeast horizon traveling now southwest bound. Almost ½ way across the sky it instantly stopped on a dime and hovered there and drifted slowly for about 10 seconds. It then instantly accelerated and started making erratic random 90 and 30 degree turns in every direction without slowing. I recall about 5-7 turns in total within about 10 seconds all within a small local vicinity of where it had initially stopped and hovered. On the last turn it stopped and hovered for about ½ a second then instantly shoot itself over the northeast horizon within a second, again with the same speed, light tracer and within the same flight path in which we had initially seen the object. All of this occurred without a sound. We lost sight of the object over the northeast horizon. My friend, my brother and I were absolutely ecstatic and bewildered after the sighting (it being our first confirmed). Not only were we first hand witnesses to a genuine, unmistakable UFO sighting (one of technological nature) but we were witnesses of a very rare, clear sighting one in which the object clearly violated known laws of physics. All without making a sound. We were very lucky, what were the odds of us being at the right place at the right time. You never forget something like that. I have searched UFO sighting videos ever since this sighting and have only found a few that even compare. I can honestly say I have witnessed something most will likely never get see first hand. Unfortunately at the time none of us had a camera or phone and weren't able to capture it. I also regret that I and or we had not reported it or documented it, exact time and date etc.. At the time I was concerned about the nature of the sighting occurring in military airspace not to mention d! irectly under the nose of NORAD. I regret letting fear and circumstances at the time deter me from stepping forward. Notes:  -Within the 10 seconds in which the object was hovering I frantically banged on the window to the room in which my brother was in and screamed at him to come out on the porch to see the object. He then quickly came onto the porch and witnessed everything that proceeded. There was an older woman in the room where my brother was that had seen the tail end of the sighting through the window. I cannot confirm exactly how much she seen. We talked about reporting it to NORAD after the sighting but we quickly decided not to out of  fear. I had stayed the night at this address. The next day around 1:00 pm two officers in dress attire came to the house asking about an apparent robbery in the area. Initially seeing them at the door made me very suspicious considering.. My brother and I sky watch whenever we get a chance. Its now almost an automatic habit. I will submit illustrations and maps asap.

The sky was completely clear and you could see the entire sky with-out cloud obstruction. While I was looking at the stars, as I often do, I saw a satalite moving accross the sky. I have seen them several times and followed it across the sky, when all of the sudden, from a totally different direction, a smaller object caught my eye. As I began to trace it, I noticed two more that came close to it from different angles. They moved around vey fast and in no planned path. Now I have never seen anthing like this before, and it made me whatch more intently after I lost track of them. I remained with my eyes affixed to the sky for approximately 1-1.5hrs. To my surprise, I was able to wittness at least 6 or more similer objects in the sky. They were way too high for our aircraft and too stealthy. It makes no differance to me whether I am believed or not, my views will remain the same. There can be no other explanation than extraterestrial. I am 35yrs old, and fairly well educated. I know what I saw last night. No. It was not a saucer, or a shape that I could identify, but the movements and distance tell me it was not from here. I am trying to find out if anyone else has seen this sort of thing before, but I don't know where to ask. For now, this will have to do.;46.3176630630631;-79.5372855855855
Big Bright Red Light;2008-11-14 02:20:00;3 mins;Big Bright Red Light I work the graveyard shift from my home office.   My desk faces my office window that faces north.  Approx 2:20 am, I happened to look up and away from my computer to see a BIG  bright red light in the sky, it was circular in shape.  The light was moving very slowly in and eastward direction.  I watched it while sitting at my desk until I couldn't see it anymore from my seat.  I stood up to see if it was still there, it continued moving in an eastward direction until it had disappeared behind the hill.;46.3176630630631;-79.5372855855855

Objects rose slowly and changed direction frequently.  A total of 11-15 were seen in a 5-10 min period.  We live very close to the NORAD base where we proceeded to call to report the incident.

Orange lights seend by 3 people Over North Bay, Ontario.;2013-12-31 23:00:00;5 minutes;Orange lights seend by 3 people Over North Bay, Ontario I was going outside to have a smoke, when like I always do look up to look at the stars, when I saw a bright Orange light ( it had no sound)  So I knew right there it wasn't an airplane, then 3 seconds later 2 more appeared, they were going pretty slow, and they too had no sound.  I watched them for about 5 minutes and then all of a sudden they just disappeared ... I know what we saw wasn't no aircraft from this planet!!;46.3176630630631;-79.5372855855855
