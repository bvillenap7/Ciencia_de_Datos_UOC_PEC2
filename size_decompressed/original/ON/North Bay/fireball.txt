Fireball over lake Nipissng the day of MIR controlled crash;2001-01-05 16:20:00;20 min;Fireball over lake Nipissng the day of MIR controlled crash This sighting happened on the day of the MIR return, so you may know the date better than me. My husb was driving me home from work (@aprox 16:20-16:50) ant the fireball/smokeball was falling over lake Nipissing (looking WNW). There was only 1 object and it looked like a huge smokeball decendng from about 2000 feet.  To approxomate the size, I would say it was 2-3 km away and could be blocked from view with a match held at arms length, but not with the head of a pin. As we drove it became obscured by trees here and there but from what we could see it fell fairly fast.  As we reached the waterfront, it appeared to be 500 feet from the surface of the water when it burnt up/dissapeared from view.  We jokingly assumed it was jetsam from the MIR controled crash, but seeing as that took place on the entire other side of the world...  There were no plane crash or other reports that could explain that sighting. There was no debris flying off, no sparks or flame but it did have an impressive tail. It also seemed no one else had seen it. The whole sighting was 20 minutes at most.;46.3176630630631;-79.5372855855855
A very bright star light kind of thing bombing down than dissapearing.;2004-02-24 19:44:00;2-3 minutes;A very bright star light kind of thing bombing down than dissapearing. I was talking joyously with my mother my fater and my brother when something appeared at the corner of my eye. I turned my head and saw this thing that looked like s flame coming towards my house but when I got up to the window the bright flaming light just dissapeared. My mother was wondering what was wrong as if maybe she thought I was delirious but I told her exactly what I am telling you guys. I was the only wittness however but I told my mom and dad and brother but no body believed me. I am going to tell my best friend about what I saw she knows more about alien spacecrafts than I do.

Zigzagging fireball in North bay, Ontario.;2012-12-05 00:00:00;30 seconds;Zigzagging fireball in North bay, Ontario My boyfriend and I were sitting in his car on peninsula road in North bay, Ontario, stargazing when we saw what appeared to be a fireball shaped object in the sky.   It went directly up, then zigzagged and disappeared from view.   We only saw it for approximately 30 seconds.;46.3176630630631;-79.5372855855855
Orange-Yellow Small Solid Light Appearing from the South East (North Bay, Ontario).;2013-03-15 23:30:00;20 seconds;Orange-Yellow Small Solid Light Appearing from the South East (North Bay, Ontario) Location: 46.325142,-79.312215 (Peninsula Rd. North Bay, Ontario, Canada)  My fiancee and I go every clear night to a park located at the above location to look at the stars, this night we were parked pointed SSW parallel with the road.  We go to this location around the same time every night arriving at the park around 23:15-23:30. We both spotted the object rising above the horizon infront of us (SSW) about 5 minuets after arriving at the park.  What we both saw was a small orange-yellowish solid light slowly rising above the horizon and continuing to rise for about 15 to 20 seconds and then disappear about two feet above the horizon from our perspective.  The light stayed the same size throughout it's ascension above the horizon in front of us and did not leave any sort of visible trail. My fiancee and I as I said before try to every night we can when it is clear go out to this location to look at the stars, never saw this kind of object before and have not seen it since in the 5 years we have been going to this location.  I am a television producer here in North Bay, and my fiancee is a student attending the local college here. We have seen several meteor showers both ourselves and together and have yet to see one that looks like this, normally you can see a flickering of the light from the meteor but this light we saw that night was solid.  My first thought was that we were seeing it travel straight towards our location since from our perspective the object rose over the horizon and ascended directly upwards.  I have seen the ISS numerous times, and I often use satellite tracking apps on my phone to locate and see flyovers over my location so I am quite familiar with what they look like, and this object looked too big, bright, and coloured to be a satellite. Anyways, I hope this is of some help, as I said before we go out to this location almost every night the clouds allow us to  and have never seen this object before or since even though it was a couple months ago now it is still fresh in my mind as I always visualize where it came from and its pattern each time we go back out to see if it does repeat or not.
