2 red orbs over lake nippissing for 5 minutes;2010-08-03 20:00:00;20 minutes;2 red orbs over lake nippissing for 5 minutes As we were sitting on our deck overlooking Lake Nippissing , looking west an orange red ball of light appeared in the north west sky just above the horizon.  I asked my friend to look and see if he could tell what it was.  My friend worked for air Canada for 28 years and had never seen anything that he could say what it was.  We sat with our wives and watched for about 6 minutes as it speed across the sky and then disappeared..  We were all in disbelief and shocked as we sat for another 10 minutes and suddenly from the same area a second orange orb appeared shot across the sky and then disappeared as well;46.3176630630631;-79.5372855855855
