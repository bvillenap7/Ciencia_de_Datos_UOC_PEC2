glowing red cylinder flying northeast observed for about three minutes at night;1973-06-06 22:00:00;2-3 minutes;glowing red cylinder flying northeast observed for about three minutes at night a long glowing cylinder, dull cherry red in color, which moved north-east at a constant speed emitting no sound. observed at night, if compared to a jetliner at altitude the object would have been about 1 1/2 to twice the length but with similar speed . no other lights or projections from the cyclinder were observed, duration of observation was from 2-3 minutes ((2nd Report from same source)) glowing red cylinder flying northeast without sound object appeared to be a cyclinder, size indeterminate but I would say that if you compared it to a commercial jetliner, it would have been about 1 1/2 times the length and of the same diameter. speed impossible to determine but again if you imagine the movement of jetliner at altitude its speed would have been about the same. It was night and its exact altitude and speed cannot be determined. the object was a cyclinder which glowed along its entire length a dull cherry-red, like an electric element on a stove when it starts to heat up. the object moved in a uniform direction, north-east at a constant speed. no other lights or protrusions were observed, nor was the object heard to emit any sound.
