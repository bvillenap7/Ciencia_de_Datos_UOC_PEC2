2 blue lights and 1 white light zig zag in city;2003-08-08 00:00:00;30-45 seconds;2 blue lights and 1 white light zig zag in city I was sitting on my front porch sometime around midnight. I was keeping an eye out for raccoons, roughly 5 houses down the opposite side of the street, I saw the first two blue lights flicker from the porch of a house and move quickly towards the street, (I didn't think much of it at first I thought it was someone running around with a flashlight, until I saw another and finally a white one, kind of like a flare). All three lights moved in a zig zag pattern, moving very fast up. All three lights were no bigger then a basketball. One went up towards the tree line in the same similar zig zag motion and all three were gone at the same time. I did hear about 2 minutes later what sounded like an aircraft flying over head, I'm not sure if it was connected.;43.3678468354431;-80.9562949367088
