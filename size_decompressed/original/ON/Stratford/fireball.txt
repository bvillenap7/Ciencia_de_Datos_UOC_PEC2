Red light, maybe a fireball came into my sight and flew north for the entire duration that I saw it. A building blocked the view after watching it fly for 3 or 4 seconds. In my opinion this was not a shooting star-different color, not as fast, and was visible for much longer. There were 2 passenger jets that it flew near and must of been going ten times their speed.;43.3678468354431;-80.9562949367088
