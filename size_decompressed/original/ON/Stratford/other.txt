At first thought light was a shooting star moving very fast from east to west until bright light made a 90 degree turn and charged direction to move from south to north.  This was not a airplane as it was moving too fast and to high up in  atmosphere to be a plane and planes can't turn as fast as this did.  Also, although light was shaped like a bird it was again moving too fast and to high in atmosphere to be a bird.;43.3678468354431;-80.9562949367088
