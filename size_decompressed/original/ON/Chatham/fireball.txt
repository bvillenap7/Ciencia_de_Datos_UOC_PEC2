Fireball in Chatham Ontario;2012-06-16 22:00:00;2 minutes;Fireball in Chatham Ontario As we were having a late night bon fire in my back yard, I noticed what I initially took to be a plane come across above the rooftops.  However the lack of blinking lights made it seem less like a plane.  Then we thought it might be a hot air balloon.  But even then, it moved too quickly.   As it got closer it looked like something on fire...but to describe what it was exactly would be almost impossible.  It didn't have any distinct shape, but rather simply looked like a ball of flame.   It maintained a steady course, East to west and then disappeared.
