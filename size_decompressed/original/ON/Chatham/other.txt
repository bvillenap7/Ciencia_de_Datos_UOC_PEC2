It was bright and shiny out after a rainstorm just like when you would normally see rainbows. I was retelling this event to my brother last night and he thought I should submit it so here is what happened. It was in the middle of the day and I was driving on hwy. 40 going southeast into Chatham, Ontario to go shopping.  It was a slow speed limit of 60 kilometers per hour.  I seen this big rainbow on the east side about 2-3 kilometers out and so I slowed down a bit to admire it.  Not alot of traffic anyways.  When I got about 1/2 kilometers away, all of a sudden I could see endless rainbows.  They didn't just appear at once.  As I got closer, I could see more rainbows in a row.  Then at the &quotcorrect angle&quot, I seen that it was an endless row of rainbows.  I was in awe and I was just saying &quotwow&quot.  I drove through it and just went to town. Every once in a while, I remember to look up endless rainbows but have not found any description.  Maybe I have wrong search term?  This was as good as seeing the meteor I described a couple of years ago on this site - when I took my dog out at night and that fireball or whatever it was went across the sky.
