3 oval shaped objects, red or pinkish colour, not very bright,  moving VERY quickly!;2005-11-03 22:30:00;5-10 secs;3 oval shaped objects, red or pinkish colour, not very bright,  moving VERY quickly! Observed either 3 oval shaped craft or 1 big one with 3 seperate oval lights on it in a triangle formation.  A red or pinkish colour emitting from sources, not very bright.  Very quick moving and moved perpendicular across the night sky, which was very clear.   Compared the speed of the craft by observing a airplane that was higher up in the sky, the observed object(s) were much quicker regardless of the height difference!    Waited and obseved the same section of sky to see if it was something else (Spotlights??) making the image(s) but nothing else appeared?  Not a sound in the sky?
