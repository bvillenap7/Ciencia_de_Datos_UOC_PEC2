I was outside having a smoke in my backyard after working a night shift. I was looking at the stars as it was a very clear night.  Then a huge black low flying V shaped object, silently pass overhead in a W SW direction, very slow, maybe 15km/h and very low, approx 200 feet up with no sound it all, so it could not have been jet or helicopter.  There were 7 dim orangish lights evenly spaced in a V pattern.  Again this thing was huge and moved very slow.  It did not seen possible for something that large to move that slow and not fall.  It was as big if not bigger than a 747 passanger jet ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD));42.4222020408164;-82.163042857143
