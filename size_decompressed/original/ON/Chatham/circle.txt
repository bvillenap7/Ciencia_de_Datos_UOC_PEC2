Orange disks over southern Ontario, Canada;2001-11-21 05:50:00;7-8 sec.;Orange disks over southern Ontario, Canada I was leaving for work at 5:50 a.m. on November 21, 2001. The sky was clear and still completely dark. I walked into my rear yard and caught site of 4 medium sized circles in a half V shape ( \ ) formation crossing the sky in a north to south direction. The four objects were an orange colour with a fuzzy outline. They moved quite quickly for from the time I spotted them directly overhead till they disappeared in the horizon was only about 7-8 seconds. They travelled in a straight line, all moving at the same speed. No sound from them was heard...they were completely soundless. Altitude was fairly low or so it seemed. Was hoping someone in the area may shed some light on this sighting. I have no idea as to what they were.;42.4222020408164;-82.163042857143

Suddenly it stopped and just stayed in one spot. After a few minutes it shifted wright went in reverse and up at an extreme speed and then we did not see it for a few minutes but then after that we noticed in the same area travelling a short distance and dissappeatr again. This was seen by myself as well as my 17yr. old son as we were sitting in our back yard at a campfire.;42.4222020408164;-82.163042857143
