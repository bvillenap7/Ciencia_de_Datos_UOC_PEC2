Two of my co-workers who I was carpooling with at the time were also in the car. Behind the jet I noticed a flashing light which I took to be another jet close behind the other or in the same area. Noticing the difference that the first jet I saw had a condensation trail and the second did not.  I let it go for a couple minutes unwatched and when we puled off the 401 at Communication road I scanned the skies again. The reason being that for the past few days I have been watching the skies for anything out fo the ordinary. Now I know why.  At apx. 5:00 pm while heading north on Creek Road I noticed what I assumed to be the jet I had seen earlier. This time it was much closer and appeared to have an unusually short condensation trail. My eyes were drawn to what I saw in the sky behind the jet. The same type of flickering I saw near the jet onthe horizon and in almost the same relative position to the jet with the con trail. I figured that this was just another jet that was catching the suns rays. Until the flickering ceased and the lagging object appeared more brilliant, even solid.  At this point I knew somethign was not normal about this so I asked the driver to pull over. Both of the other passengers had seen what I was looking at before I asked to pull over. We stopped at the corner of Creek road and Indian Creek road, got out of the car and watched as the two objects traveled in a South Southeastern direction. The distance between the two objects was apx. the distance from the tip of your index finger to the tip of your thumb while held at arms length.  My friend suggested that it was an airplane that had another object or craft in tow but that turned out not to be the case. As we were facing south and both objects passed in front of us, the condensation trail behind the red dot dissapeared. Both objects proceeded along their paths and then apx. three seconds later the red dot had started traveling backwards. It did not stop, or turn. it REVERSED.  Up until this point I was awaiting the moment when I could say Ahh, that's just a couple airplanes I do not know of any modern aircraft that could mimick the movement I saw.  When the red dot reversed its path, there was apx. 3 seconds where it appeared as though the trailing object and the red dot were going to collide.  The two objects passed very close to each other and both travelled out of sight at a constant speed. The white luminous object heading South Southeast and the red dot, on its reversed path, and without condensation trail, progressed North Northwest.  All three of us that witnessed this event can not come up with any rational explanation for what happened.
