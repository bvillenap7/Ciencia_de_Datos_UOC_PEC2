As we were entering our door, we were on the front porch, when she pointed right above us, and asked me Mama what's that? I looked up and right above us, appx 20ft, was a object, circular I believe now, because as we looked up, it started a light show.  Lights went around the craft in green, white and red, amazing...I looked further into the sky and could see two other crafts further in the distance...well I dropped my bags, ran inside to get my video camera, of course it had no batteries, so I proceeded to call my cousin who lives approx. 10 miles to the southeast, they thought I was crazy....well I don't remember what we did then.  Whether we stayed and watched it, went inside, etc...that part has been bugging me for years, I can't remember if I just closed the door on it...I can't believe that I would...and I have an excellent memory, but this evades me. That's my siting, and it was amazing, just amazing.  That craft was right above us, I live in the country.  It put on a light show for us!   My daughter ended up joining the military 7 years later, and nobody in our family has ever been in the military, and it's a big family.  She always said she was going to be the Prime Minister of Canada one day...perhaps it was there for her....odd regardless and something I just can't forget nor she.;43.9907;-77.2329
