We noticed a rather large light in the sky. It was orange and it seemed to big to be a star more like a planet. The light looked to be hanging in the sky over another town. As we watched the light it appeared to be moving but it could of just been flickering. We had become disinstrested in it and began doing what we were doing. What happend next was when we all new that somthing was not right. the light in the sky had become much brighter and at least twice the size. We were amazed by this and wonder what it was. We then thought its not geting bigger i think its getting closer. the object had appeared to be coming closer the details of it became clearer. it had actually looked like it had wings like an aircraft. it had gone back to its spot and moved back and forth. it would jump up and down and continued doing that. What happend next was very very bizarre. The light became small again and it took off to the left in a curve. it was not traveling very vast. It looked exactly like airplane and was traveling at the speed of a comericial jet. I dont not know exactly what it was but it is very odd for a light dancing in the sky to suddenly take off and appear to be a jet. antoher small light off to the left did the same thing but was smaller seeming like it was farther away. they both dissapeared like a plane would when it goes behind a cloud but there was no cloud near that light.;42.0326;-82.9169
