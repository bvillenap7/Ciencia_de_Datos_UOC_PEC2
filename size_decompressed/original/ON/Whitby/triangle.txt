Hovering three white lights and flashing red triangle craft;2005-02-24 18:50:00;1 minute;Hovering three white lights and flashing red triangle craft Driving home,eastward on the 401 (Feb.24, 2005 at approx. 6:50 p.m.) on this full moon night, there it was! I observed three white lights with a single red flashing light in the center of the craft, it was hovering over slightly northeast east of my position, I'm going to guess it was triangular due to distance and angle.  This hovering craft, was definitely over Whitby, as I watched it while driving towards to the east.My distance from the object was about 3-4 miles approx.It stayed at a low altitude of 2000-3000 ft.  As I drew closer to it.It started to move off over the eastern Whitby very slow and over western Oshawa ,Ontario.  This one is a new one for me. Could it have been military?  It was that big whatever it was  and even kind of spooky-due to the distant spread of the three white lights. It was definitely not a helicopter, it was way too long, not to mention the lighting sequence. Theruby red light seem to be rotating in flashing. I flashed my head! lights on and off twice, while driving. It appeared to flash back, but not so brightly, there was a difference in its lighting tone. After that happened as I drew closer to it, that's when it started to move off. Now, other people must have seen this one. Maybe my report on this sighting may be the first one.Hopefully may well not be the last in reporting this sighting. Other witnesses over Whitby and Oshawa must have seen this one as big as it was.This should be report by other who witnessed it . I'm sure if anybody had seen it. They were dumb stricken.PS When I flashed my headlights and slowed down IN MY CAR.Traffic in front of me also slowed down.I'm concluding they too must have witnessed this thing.I was so excited to get home that night to watch Peter Jennings- ABC ~Seeing is Believing ~ Gee, I again witnessed something incredible and unexplainable.I believe each time I witness these unknown aerial anomalies.It creates a wondering obsessive afterthought in question ? ! What the heck was it in timing to see this thing up there !!!~;43.9010154320988;-78.942463580247
Dark triangular craft with white light on each point and large white light in middle.;2007-03-13 23:15:00;1 minute;Dark triangular craft with white light on each point and large white light in middle. My boyfriend is sane and sober so when he phoned me immediately to tell me about this, I believed him.  I’m hoping someone else in the area has witnessed the same, for it was so very conspicuous.  It was late at night when he was on his balcony (facing south) and off to the west, in the distance, approached what looked like a helicopter with a searchlight.  As it drew closer, he realized this was nothing man-made.  It drifted in a straight line ever so casually over the trees across the parking lot in front of him heading toward Oshawa. It was somewhat larger than a bus.  He described it as triangular with a small white light on each point.  In the middle was a massive white light but with no beam coming off it.  The ship was darker than the sky behind it and the lights on it reflected faintly on the underside of the ship.  It made absolutely no sound.  I don’t know if this is significant, but the next day he found a burn mark on his left shoulder the size of his thumb.;43.9010154320988;-78.942463580247
july 21/2007,11:00pm-whitish,triangular image shoots across sky in toronto area....;2007-07-21 11:00:00;6seconds;july 21/2007,11:00pm-whitish,triangular image shoots across sky in toronto area.... we were at a bbq,enjoying the clear nights’ sky.an image came travelling over the house,from east to west,and moving very quickly.i was trying to get the attention of the people,but i froze,and by the time i could speak,it was already a fading image and was quite far away.only one other person caught the image,but it was already so far away. the image appeared as a fast travelling triangle.it was a whitish colour,almost faded looking,and had 3 lights on each point of the triangle.it appeared almost translucent.it was travelling so quickly,it went from east to west within seconds,and then just faded away.when i first saw the image,i was looking at the bottom of it as it travelled above me.then it travelled west,and i saw the image turn into more of a line,like a side image.i can only describe it like a kite above me,but then like the side image of a kite as it travelled away form me.the size was much larger than anything i have ever seen in the sky.it did not look at all like a plane or a fireball,or satellite.it seemed very close to the house but then at the same time,so far away,as it was somewhat blurry.like i said,i have never seen anything like this,or been so taken away but what i saw.it was a once in a life time thing,i am sure.it just happened so fast.;43.9010154320988;-78.942463580247
