I was walking to school when I saw a disc that seemed to have two wings on the sides.  it flew at a constant speed about 250' altitude in a hprizonal direction.  It then climbed at about a 40 degree angle and then disapeared.  I know what a plane looks like, but this craft gave me chills.;43.9010154320988;-78.942463580247
