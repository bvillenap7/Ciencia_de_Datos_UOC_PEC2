Bright craft followed by 6 police aircraft.;2002-03-11 21:03:00;20 seconds;Bright craft followed by 6 police aircraft. I was driving on my way home from work around 9:00 pm, and as I passed the park near my house when something in the sky passed my eye. It was very bright, and naturally, my curiousity got the best of me. I sat there for about 20-30 seconds watching this thing. It started stationary, and after about 3 seconds, I visually lined it up with a tree to track it's movement, in which there was none that I could notice. It then swiftly moved the right, and then stopped again. 6 aircraft, couldn't tell if they were helicopters of planes due to distance, appeared. The helicopters appeared to have police type flashing lights on them someplace. Every aircraft had these lights except the craft in question. The craft was very bright, and appeard to change shape and color. It went from a light white, to a dark orange, and the back again. It was after sunset, so it wasn't a reflection on the craft that accounted for the light. I went home to get my digital camera, came back, and the craft was gone, but the helicopters stayed there for about 2 minutes more, and then flew away in formation.;43.9010154320988;-78.942463580247
Orange ball of fire moving fast across a clear night sky...;2012-05-26 22:00:00;30 seconds;Orange ball of fire moving fast across a clear night sky... I was outside having a cigarette, and I looked up and saw an orange/red &quotplane&quot or so I thought at first in the sky. It was moving quite fast, then slowed down. I realized that this was not an airplane, nor a helicopter.  The sky was clear, and there were no clouds in sight...it started blacking out, and coming back bright orange/red and kept blacking out. I felt an odd feeling come across my body and my eyes began watering for some reason.  I knew this had to be a ufo, and I ran inside to get my wife, and when I came back out it was gone.  Another strange part to this story, was that there was definitely enough time to run in quick, yell to my wife and I run back out to see it if it was a plane it would have still been visible.  I know this was not a helicopter as it was moving too fast, and was too high for a chopper.  And I know it was not a plane because planes simply don't look that way in the sky...a little freaked out at the moment, and mad that my wife didn't see it to believe it.  I know what I saw in the sky, and &quotthey&quot are definitely watching us on this planet.;43.9010154320988;-78.942463580247
