On Monday, May 8th, 2017, outside on my deck in Oshawa, I sat down, enjoying my tea and smoke on my first day holiday off work.  The sky was mostly clear as I looked about in the sky.  After about one minute looking up in the sky Notice towards the southwest over neighboring Whitby, Ontario, township  Looking very high in the sky and some miles away A brilliant white unknown object sitting near stationary What ever it is must of had size It had a shimmering look to it with light intensity.  I then grabbed my camera and started to try and capture this long distant anomaly @ 1:02 pm est The object was near stationary as I watched and filmed it until 1:24 pm It did move ever so slowly towards the northwest as I had lost visual due to clouds I took many pictures and short video clips in trying to capture what I was witnessing Will send some pictures to you in photographic evidence;43.9010154320988;-78.942463580247
