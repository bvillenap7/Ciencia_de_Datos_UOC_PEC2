My brother came home from a date and laid out beside me and began to help me star gaze,after about half an hour he said what is that pointing north(we were laying heads to the east feet west)l looked and saw a flashing light moving across the sky about the speed of the space station, when the light was directly over us it stopped,flashed several times then traveled directly west then stopped and again sat there and flashed on and off a few times, then the light moved directly east crossed its own path and moved the same distance as it did west,east, the light stopped again flashed on and off,then moved back to its original path,sat and flashed then starting back on its path south at the same speed then began to speed up within seconds was going so fast it turned into a solid light and was gone.  l have never and will probably never see something go so fast!!!  l think about it quite often because l cant explain it maybe you can?

It was a cloudy night and therefore no stars could be seen, thinking it was a star... but it faded in/out (which could have been clouds) until it started to zig zag and then a bright flash that enveloped the sky and it was gone.;43.9010154320988;-78.942463580247
Strong contrasting light, quick disappearance;2009-07-06 08:30:00;10 seconds;Strong contrasting light, quick disappearance 2009-07-06 8:30 AM Whitby, ON (Canada)  I saw a strange light that seemed to hover over the townscape, contrasting sharply with the grey sky. Whatever it was, it emitted light, although it was early in the morning. Suddenly, the light disappears in front of my own eyes. I can’t believe what I’m seeing. No one seems to notice the strange, fading dot. Conclusion: Whatever it was, it radiated light unlike an airplane, a pallor probably with a more sinister purpose than communication. It faded away without hesitation, like it knew that it was being watched. It disappeared very quickly although its outline was still large, which means that the object wasn’t flying directly away.;43.9010154320988;-78.942463580247
Two lights in a staright line, very quickly with no sound.;2009-09-15 22:00:00;2 minutes;Two lights in a straight line, very quickly with no sound. I was out front of my house in the suburbs, with about 4 of my friends and my father.  My father looked up to the sky and pointed out a pair of strange lights. They were two very bright white lights. They traveled in an eerily straight line, one behind the other. They had no directional lights like a small plane, and they made no sound.  It looked to me like these lights were a part of one massive object, the way they moved together was out of this world, if it was one object it must have been at least a Km across, and the speed it was going was quicker than anything I have seen.  It moved from the west of the region to the east where both lights disappeared in the exact same spot in the sky. Me and my father talk of UFOs all the time, but there was also 4 other people who never would have given them a second thought.  We all agreed we saw the same thing, and we were left with a strange feeling in our stomachs the rest of the night, just because of the extraordinary site we saw.  I will never forget that, and we all still talk of it to this day.;43.9010154320988;-78.942463580247
Strange bright light hanging low in the night sky (not a planet) moved very slow and pulsing orange.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));2010-07-02 22:41:00;1 hour;Strange bright light hanging low in the night sky (not a planet) moved very slow and pulsing orange/yellow and changed its shape. Witnessed a strange very bright light that hung in the sky to the north-west, low just above the horizon (no other stars visible in the sky).  The object moved very very slowly left-to-right back and forth.   I had an HD camera and filmed this object for approx 15 minutes.  Digital zoom to 200x and saw bright strobing colours of orange-yellow with pulsing reddish centre and green outine.  Diamond shaped (but this might be caused by my camera aperature).   Object appeared to change shape a number of times and alter its brightness (I have this on film).  I watched it until it eventually faded out of vision.  Very strange and I have no idea what I saw.

Slow low round white light fades out.;2011-05-30 23:15:00;5-7 seconds;Slow low round white light fades out I thought to share a recent night time sighting over  eastern Whitby,  Ontario. On Monday, May 30th, 2011. My wife and I were walking our dog in western Oshawa at about 11:15pm Eastern. Whitby would be a stone’s throw from where we were walking in Oshawa. My wife was talking with me and looking towards the east. I turned around towards the west looking in the sky. A bright round white light was in sight about quarter mile away. It was very slow moving and low like a Cessna. No sound could be heard and then just faded out like a light blub. The sighting lasted about 5-7 seconds. I tried to show my wife as this happened. When she turned around to looked where I pointed . It was longer visual in sight. She said there’s nothing up there !  I just then laughed, knowing I had witnessed something odd. Strange, as I have seen this type before at night while walking the dog. Thanks again for your interest and time.;43.9010154320988;-78.942463580247
a light with intelegence in the north east sky above whitby .;2012-05-31 03:45:00;aprox 5 minutes;a light with intelegence in the north east sky above whitby . Hello .I've had a interest in the topic of U.F.O. watching various shows and listing to radio programs for the past Year or so.,what's interesting about this sighting were the events leading up to this early morning sighting.  For the past month I've been observing diffrent types of helicopters ,iam only aware of one chopper  Operated by the durham police department.  I've had seen three black helicopters almost like special ops ,a plain white one was also seen all together flying north east off the four corners .  A week after that I seen a black jet with no markings flying at a high rate of speed in the same direction as the choppers towards the canadian shield .  Which brings us to todays sighting ,at aprox,3:45am I was outside having a smoke. Looking up (north to north east ) I seen something that looked like a star but it was moving.  Then I thought it may be a satelite. It had stopped I call for my partner to come see the u.f.o. we then observed it excellerate at a high rate of speed only to stop it seemed at or beside a star. It then moved  up down then side to side.  Then it moved in the direction of the other aircraft I described earlier in prior weeks (north to north east) in a quick but not high rate if speed .we both waited awile to see if any other activity would happen. .after waiting for 30 min. we had stoped  looking .;43.9010154320988;-78.942463580247
