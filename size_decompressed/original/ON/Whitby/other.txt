I looked up at the sky, it was a clear night and you could see the stars. All of a sudden I saw this bright white shape, I guess you could say it was in the shape of a tear drop, but very large with a large white tail, moving very fast. Faster than I had ever seen anything move. It lite up the sky, and unlike a falling star that goes downward, this bright white light, with a large trail of smoke behide it. Or what seemed like a trail of smoke was moving upward very very fast. Then it was gone. I had never seen anything before like it. But the stranges thing was the tail of smoke seemed to disappear with it, as though it was attached to it.I can draw it, but having trouble discribing it. We do not live near any airports, airfields armybases or anything that could of caused it. It was very dark out side and this lite up the sky, it was so big.

I was running in and out of the house with cooking on the BQ. At approximately 4:52pm est. As I was inside the house to come out. I noticed at a distance over one mile away high in the sky. [ 10-20,000 ft] A strange round translucent object with a white light. I quickly grabbed my camera and took four pictures.4:53pm est Watching directly west towards over Whitby this thing was moving. Would be a couple miles north of Lake Onatrio. The photos illustrate a disk shaped object with a light. It is very unfortunate that it was that far away for better detail on the photos. Though, fortunate enough to capture this unknown object on film. The entire sighting was less than one minute. Due to it moving west towards Ajax/Pickering. I lost sight of it due to distance and haze. Sky conditions were clear with haze. I will send all four picture to back up my observation;43.9010154320988;-78.942463580247
