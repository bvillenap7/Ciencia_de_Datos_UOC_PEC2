5 Bright Orange Lights in the Sky - In an Octagon Formation;2014-04-24 21:10:00;1:10 minutes;5 Bright Orange Lights in the Sky - In an Octagon Formation It was approximately 9:10 pm on Thursday, April 24, 2014, when I was out side and noticed 5 bright orange lights in the sky - North East.  The lights were as large and as bright as street lights, but in the sky and they didn't even come close to looking like the stars..   At first I thought they were planes, but there was NO way planes could move like these lights were.  The lights seemed to come closer and brighter and larger at the same time.   The next thing they started to change formation from an octagon shape (like connect the dots)to a crooked line (hockey stick)   That's when I yelled to my husband and daughter to look outside.   The lights then started to move upwards, simultaneously and 1 by 1 they would dissappear. I have never seen anything like this in my life..  And I am still startled by it today.;43.9010154320988;-78.942463580247
