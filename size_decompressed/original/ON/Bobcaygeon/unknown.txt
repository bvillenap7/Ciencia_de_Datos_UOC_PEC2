5 Flashing lights, in tandem.;2006-08-28 22:00:00;60 Seconds;5 Flashing lights, in tandem. Time is aproximate. +/- 30 minutes, unfortunately. Facing West looking out over Sturgeon lake.   First we saw one light comming over the  trees from the South and then turning East over the lake. This object flashed a white light. This was followed on the same course, speed, and altitude by a second object, then a third, to a total of 5 of the same object spaced aprox. 600metres each, and each one flashing once, from first to last, in turn.  I would estimate the speed to be aprox. 400km/h, and the altitude to be aprox. 8,000ft. I have considered it may have been a group of aircraft from CFB Trenton, aprox. 100km S/E but have no way to confirm if such a flight may have occurred. Other aircraft within view were at a much higher altitude, on what appears to be routine flight paths.;44.5316;-78.549
