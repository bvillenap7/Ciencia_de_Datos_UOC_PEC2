Coming home form work. saw an orange disk in the east sky.;2015-09-17 04:15:00;5 minutes;coming home form work . saw an orange disk in the east sky. I came home from work when I notice my back yard light was on.  I went to inspect the light which was left on by wife.   When I turn east there was a orange light moving slightly back and forth about 2000 feet from me and at an elevation about 200 feet.  This craft was not there when I past by this area a minute before in my car.   I was very tired so I just went into my house and went to bed.  The next night, I checked the sky in the same area to see if there was the same light there and to prove it was not just a star, there was not any light there, which proves I did see some.
