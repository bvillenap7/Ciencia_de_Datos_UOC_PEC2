I caught part of the program on the radio today on Coast to Coast.  So now I scambled onto my computer after work and searched for the program info.  But I actaully found Arts web page and the entire broadcast from this mornings show.  I am in Toronto Canada. Let me also include that I am an amature astronomer as well, so I can tell the difference from planets, stars, satalites, meteorites and so on. But this was a daytime sighting. Here is my sighting. It was a partly cloudy day, I believe it was August/September (chestnuts were ready to pick) 1974 I believe.  I was 13. My brother and I were out on a chestnut hunt looking for chestnuts.  We were on our way back from gathering chestnuts from a farm just outside the town of Elmira, Ontario, Canada.  It was about 4pm.  After we came out of the farm field we walked down a road (walking northeastwards)  I looked and saw this object above the trees directly ahead of us.  It was about 400 feet or so away from us, it was moving very slowly towards us and up but slightly moving to our right.  It was triangular shaped.  From my position it was about the size of a baseball diamond.  Silvery/ grey in colour, it was raised in the centre, it was very smooth looking.  It made no sound at all.    I don't recall seeing any kind of windows.   It slowly moved upwards and went through the clouds and that is were I lost sight of it.  I saw it for about 4 or 5 minutes. When we got home I told my mother what we I saw.  My mother put the radio on and there were other reports of this sighting on the radio. Thank you for your time.
