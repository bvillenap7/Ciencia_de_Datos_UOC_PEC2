Very bright objects Flashing light white, red, green, and blue lights observed moving erratically and defying gravity.  Very unnatural movement.  Overhead light had very bright white turning on and off moving North to South for about 10 minutes then disappeared.  I have never observed lights like this before.  Observed 1 light on night of 24th in northern sky 25 degrees above horizon, 1 light on the 25th to the west 20 degrees above horizon and 4 lights on the night of the 26th 2 to the west 1 to the north and overhead.  There were 3 witnesses over the 3 nights.  It will be cloudy this evening so will not be able to see if they will be back again tonight.  Will check again tomorrow.  Very unusual especially as these objects have appeared on consecutive nights.;45.354;-76.4835
