I have a strange vibe by entering this information, but I was with 2 other guys all of us are in our early 30s.  I have the time as after 10:05 p.m to 10:15 on Sat. Aug. 10, 2013.   I went into house to change and my friend was watching this object for a dozen or so seconds before I looked up from Orangeville looking southward as if above the village of Alton in County of Caledon.  The night was starry and clear and a chill as well, but I quickly got excited as what was before our eyes made no sense.  It was alone and the size and sorta shape of a double-doubledecker bus kinda but up at a height a small plane could make it up to.   The UFO as, I'm comfy to call it, was flickering entirely in a random light as if it were on fire and wasn't fast but did alternate speeds a tad.   There was a plane in the higher sky from ENE to WSW and when we saw/said that, the ufo/object is in its line and then it went in a direct and intentional southward position and moved, nut not warp or nothing BUT THE LIGHT WENT OUT FAST AND IT WAS OVER.   Never was it bright or obviously a normal object in the sky like a plane, chopper, balloon or meteor or an object I'll likely ever see again and never thought I would.   IT'S NEAT TO HAVE THIS EXPERIENCE AND HOPE TO LEARN ABOUT THIS, THROUGH LIKE THE TORONTO PEARSON AIRPORT RADAR MAYBE, I DUNNO. I hope there is ways this can be possibly corroborated.   I wanna share the story and esp. find out what the heck WE saw!?  Thanks;43.8716807692308;-79.8843730769231
