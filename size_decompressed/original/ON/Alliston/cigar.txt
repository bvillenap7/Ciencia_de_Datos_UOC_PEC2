Cigar-shaped horizontal object with solid yellow lights in Alliston, Ontario.;2014-08-27 20:45:00;few seconds;Cigar-shaped horizontal object with solid yellow lights in Alliston, Ontario. Just a bit after dusk, I was sitting at my backyard table in Alliston, Ontario.  My backyard faces south looking over a farmer's field. I noticed a cigar shaped (horizontal) object which was heading West at a very rapid rate.  The object had very bright yellow lights (not flashing but solid).   It was travelling very fast and only lasted perhaps 5 seconds before vanishing.   I jumped up and ran to the edge of my yard, but there was no more sign of it.  It was not too high in the sky and at first I thought it might be either a comet or a drone.   There was no tail or trail behind it and since the lights were solid, I discounted both of these ideas. While looking for similar pictures on the net for the last few days it closely resembled a picture taken from Mexico in May 2013.;44.1492;-79.8685
Cigar shaped objects in the air. multiple angles multiple time frames.;2017-05-10 05:22:00;1hr or so;Cigar shaped objects in the air. multiple angles multiple time frames. I had a roofing company come to my house to give me a quote on a new metal roof. He took 32 pictures. After he took the pictures he noticed that in a few of them a weird thing in the sky. They dont look like a plane to me. He did not notice them when he was taking the pictures for the roof. It was only a few days after when he was looking at the photos to make a quote up on the metal roof.;44.1492;-79.8685
