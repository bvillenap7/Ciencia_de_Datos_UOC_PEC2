Two very bright blue and red lights on a flying object in the night sky.;2012-07-28 01:00:00;2 hours;Two Very bright blue and red lights on a flying object in the night sky. Two objects with very bright blue and red lights in the night sky, hovering around, as if standing still. Not really moving at all but, seemed like it was spinning about its axis, because the colors seem to be revolving or switching between the blue and red, ocassionally white light also appear.  After an hour both objects moved slowly, then one object started to go in behind tall trees and lost visual contact.  The other object was moving upwards and east direction, at this point looked more white, but could still see faintly blue and red lights.  Once very high in the sky was moving in zig zag fashion then took off really fast,  about 10 times faster then a plane.

Bright white light in the sky.;2012-09-28 19:10:00;2 minutes;Bright white light in the sky. My husband and I were sitting on our front porch and seen a bright white light in the sky, moving very slowly, moving west, no blinking lights like a plane and too early for stars to be seen.  It was going one way and then disappeared and then we seen it appear in a different spot going north, 90 degrees from where we first seen it and then it disappeared again.
