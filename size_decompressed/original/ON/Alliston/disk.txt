Disk shaped object with white/blue lights and halo, near Alliston, Ontario, Canada;2012-09-12 22:15:00;1.00  hour;Disk shaped object with white/blue lights and halo, near Alliston, Ontario, Canada My aunt and I were sitting outside and as I was gazing up at the stars which are very clear near my home and I noticed an object that seemed extraordinarily bright and highly unusual for a star, so I monitored it for a period of time.  Over the course of 45 minutes, what appeared to be a disk shaped object moved north east very slightly and flashed mainly white lights with a hint of blue and an occasional dull orange. The object was moving far too slowly for a plane, or satellite and did not have the same light pattern or colors as a plane. Both my aunt and i concluded, It also appeared to have a strange &quothalo&quot or &quot aura&quot shape around it, which gave off a faint blue glow.  I'm certain the object moved from its location, as there is a wire suspended between two posts which is entirely stationary, so I was able to assess its position over the course of 45 minutes.;44.1492;-79.8685
