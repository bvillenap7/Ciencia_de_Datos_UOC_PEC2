Rapidly moving lights in westerly direction, then disappearing.;1999-04-26 00:30:00;10 seconds;Rapidly moving lights in westerly direction, then disappearing. I observed 2 reddish colored lights in the sky, at about 70 degree angle, moving west.  The lights appeared to be at a high altitude.  They were moving at the same rate of speed, but one light was slightly ahead of the other.  Initially, it appeared as if there were two shooting stars moving beside each other, but whatever it or they were was moving slower than any shooting star I have observed yet much too fast to be an aircraft.  As I watched, both lights disappeared simultaneously, yet the travel path was still clear - in other words, if it were an airplane, it would have continued to have been observable.  It all occurred within about 10 seconds.  I can say that I have never seen anything like it before.;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724
Bright reflective object in proximity to commercial airliner;2018-04-21 16:15:00;5-8 seconds;Bright reflective object in proximity to commercial airliner Sitting in the shade of a front porch column, having an after dinner smoke was watching an aircraft comming out of Pearson Airport about 40 miles to the west, complaining to myself I hope that'a contrail not a chemtrail I suddenly noticed a bright silver metalic reflection about (my estimate 400/600 feet to the port side and 100/200 feet to the rear of the aircraft.   Very short duration, very bright reflection because of the angle of the sun at that time.  Am ex-RCN, and worked for Canadair (now Bombardier) on various aircraft, and am presently employed at an Ontario manufacturier of aircraft parts, so am very familliar with many regular aircraft ant their flight characteristics.;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724
2 people saw pulsating small craft for 30-40 seconds;2020-08-29 20:50:00;30-40 seconds;2 people saw pulsating small craft for 30-40 seconds A friend and I were driving on a residential street 500m or so from my home when we saw a craft fly just in front of my car.  The craft's shape was difficult to see clearly, but it was slowly pulsating orange light. It appeared low to the ground, (maybe 100 to 200 meters off the ground) and seemed to be small in size, perhaps only a few meters in circumference.  Initially I thought it was a drone because of it's size, elevation and it was only moving 40-60km per h I would estimate. We took a few pictures and followed it for about 20 seconds before the lights dimmed out and we could not see it any more, it may have disappeared or just turned off it's lights. Also, there was no sound.  I have looked on youtube for night helicopter videos and I cannot find anything that looks even remotely close to what we saw.;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724
