Three white lights, no sound, not moving above tree line, then vanishes with no trace, sound,or light!;1993-06-15 22:30:00;3  minutes;Three white lights, no sound, not moving above tree line, then vanishes with no trace, sound,or light! I was driving home from work and I wasn't far past the truck stop on the way to port hope from oshawa, ontario,canada, when I saw ahead in the distance a bright white light hovering over the tree line, maybe 100 meters off the side of the road on the north side, (I am heading east). At first I thought it was a helicopter searching the area or something. As I approached it I noticed there were 3 lights not just 1. They were in a perfect triangle spaced apart about the distanceof a baseball game baseline(1st to 2nd eg.). The strange thing was I couldn't see any craft whatsoever. If I recall correctly the lights were about the size of one of those coca cola advertizing discs, roughly. I had my eyes glued to it at this point, I slowly hit the brakes and motioned the car off of the road, onto the soft shoulder, I snapped my head to the front to be sure I wasn't gong into the ditch and spun my head back toward the object. It was gone! No big flash of light, but the wierdest part was there was no sound!!Nothing! I felt sort of dazed for a second or two wondering how the hell does a thing that friggin big disappear like that!;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724
Large silent metallic craft,very fast and no lights;2012-10-12 21:25:00;3 seconds;large silent metallic craft,very fast and no lights I was enjoying a quite night with my family on our hot tub in our backyard, we turned off the tub lights to admire the beautiful night sky and watch the glimmering stars when out of the north west came this beautiful V shaped craft, no noise and no lights,yet she was gliding fast, light metallic grey and it must have been very close, we could make out 7 large metallic spheres 3 on each wing and one near the tip of the nose, we could notice the separation on the different parts of the wings.   It came fast and at first glance I thought it was one of those stealth fighters but not until suddenly and very graciously the craft made a 90 degree turn and accelerated to a never to be seen again incredible speed!;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724
Three Bright Ruby Red Lights In Triangle Formation.;2014-08-10 21:19:00;2 minutes;Three Bright Ruby Red Lights In Triangle Formation On August 10, 2014, at 9:19 pm est I was alone on my driveway washing my car in Oshawa It had just hit past dusk - with little light to the west I could suddenly hear a loud buzzing sound and looked north About about half mile away noticed three bright ruby lights moving across the sky They were moving from the east to the west at about the speed of a Cessna These three red ruby lights kept in a constant triangular formation as they moved across together They looked about one to two hundred yards apart at about few thousand feet in altitude I was frozen watching them in front of me for about twenty seconds I then ran into my house and retrieved my camera back outside in less than twenty seconds. Once outside I snapped one clear followed by four pictures on a high zoom These images appear orb like due to zoom The formation continued heading west over Whitby heading southward towards Ajax,Ontario  I last picture taken reveals a structure between the lights - weird ! Could this well have been a triangle type aircraft that was cloaked ? There were others that had witnessed and reported this thing Even in Burlington,Ontario So it was first observed from Oshawa to Whitby to Ajax to Burlington Ontario;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724
