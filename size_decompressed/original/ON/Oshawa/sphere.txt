Low flying basketball sized translucent spherical bubble;2003-11-01 16:00:00;20 seconds;Low flying basketball sized translucent spherical bubble On November 1st 2003, while in my backyard in Oshawa at exactly 4:00pm. I noticed a translucent round spherical bubble moving quite low over the houses. This thing moved across over the roofs about 10 feet above the homes. It came in from the north moving southwest. The size looked like that of a basketball. I watched in disbelief as it passed by only 80 -100 feet away. This thing witnessed ,only lasted in visual contact for about 20 seconds. It was not moving very fast - maybe 5 mph. I called a Toronto Rock station to report what I had seen. Then I heard the person talking to another person at the station. I could hear there was also another UFO sighting earlier in a western town outside Toronto. This one was a strange one to witness. It was no way just a big bubble. If it was due to it's size. It should have popped !  Yet in appearance. It did look in features of that of a large bubble. There were no other witnesses- dang !;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724
Low flying bright neon green spherical object moving slow just above houses;2009-12-27 00:07:00;4-5 seconds;Low flying bright neon green spherical object moving slow just above houses This event happened at exactly 12:07am,on December 27th, 2009.  I was driving my youngest son’s girlfriend home in Northeast Oshawa.  I turned off Ritson north of Rossland-east into the neighborhood. As we drove through the street eastward- I could see a bright intense neon green sphere with outlines of bright white light moving within.  It moved over the roof tops of homes some 20 ft above, or lower.  It moved like a bubble in water and was very slow and bright.  The size look small, but maybe bigger than a basketball to guess.  As I drove watching it and screaming out loud to the kids to look.  My son confirms instantly he sees it !  He was NOT even wearing his glasses, as it was about hundred yards away quite bright.  Witnessed for maybe about 4-5 seconds, as we drove by, we then lost sight of it.-- It was that low over the homes .  Needless to say, his girlfriend missed seeing this incredible display.  My son’s reaction after dropping his girlfriend off was upsetting !  He said I should not freak out about some burning light, as I was being embarrassing to him.  I just thought it was quite a sight to witness, as it was that intense of light and very close to the roof tops of the homes.  Its movements were strange.  Like a rushing bubble before hitting the surface.  I thought to add a composite to better illustrate.

Two spherical lights moving together, one in line with the other, at an immense speed.;2013-05-20 22:05:00;1.5;Two spherical lights moving together, one in line with the other, at an immense speed. We were sitting in the backyard looking up at a passing satellite. We were wondering if it was just a normal satellite or the space station.  That is when we noticed two spherical lights in a tight formation that flew by at an immense speed.  As fast as it came it left.   We were wondering everything it could be, but realized it was not any shooting stars as the never burnt out or left a tail, then we thought debris but again no smoke trail.  We knew it wasn't a plane as it moved to fast and was not flashing.   We were wondering if you could help us out and just give some info if anybody else saw anything and reported it. Please email thank you.;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724

Colourful Ball of Light Over Lake Ontario, Canada.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of celestial bodies?  PD));2016-11-22 21:30:00;3 hours;Nov 22/2016:  Colourful Ball of Light Over Lake Ontario, Canada I am a 55 y/o male, single, and live by myself in the East suburbs near Toronto, Canada. This is important to this event, as it means I was in my home alone, with no one to catch a missing time event.  Although I completely believe in aliens and UFO's, I have never seen one before.  My background is in both Accounting and Computer Technology. On the night of Nov 22nd, 2016, I had my AM radio set to listen to Coast2Coast at 9pm as I often do. However, that night's repeat program of the previous night was about The US Dollar and such, and the topic did not interest me.  I turned off the radio and set it aside. I browsed the Internet for a short period of less than 1/2 hour or so, and decided to go to bed. Glancing at the clock, I remember it to be approx 9:30pm.  Maybe 9:25pm Closing the living room blinds, I noticed 2 aircraft outside in the sky.  That is common, as there is a nearby airport.  However, both craft were stationary, and I could not hear any sound of helicopters.  The bodies of the crafts were not visible, just a single dim yellow light, and a stronger red light that was flashing.  I assumed them to be standard hovering helicopters, with an aviation beacon on the bottom. If you held a ruler up against the window, the craft would have been about 10 apart, which was close enough that I could see both together. I thought it strange that two craft were allowed to fly so close to each other. I glanced to the right (South / East ) over Lake Ontario, and saw a very bright and large star. However, the star was fiercely shimmering/twinkling, and was larger than any star I've seen. It was round, and seemed to be spinning.  Every colour was flashing in split seconds. Red/Green/Blue/White/Yellow. Like as diamond - flashing rainbow colours of light.  But clearly spinning.   My eyes went back and forth between the 2 stationary crafts and the star and I blurted out They're watching it too!!  At this point, I became excited at the thought it may be a UFO, as I have never seen one before. I grabbed a pair of binoculars from a cabinet next to me, and tried to view the star through the window but it was not clear.  The binoculars are inexpensive 7x35 magnification. Next to the window, is a door to my patio. Standing in the doorway, I looked directly South / East over Lake Ontario at the star, looking at it with bare eyes, watching it spin with fantastic split-second colours. I held up the binoculars, and tried to focus more, but the focus was almost at the 'infinity' setting of the focus ring,  and no fine adjustment could improve the view. However, the binoculars did allow me to see the same round shape, clearly spinning, showing amazing colours. But no further definition of the object.  I said out loud, We see you. We're watching you, whatever you are. Jokingly expecting it to respond by zooming away. It did not. It was far too large to be a star. I became very excited and scrambled to put on shoes and coat and grabbed my cell phone to take a picture. I ran outside. The sky was jet black, and I could see the 'star' clearly. Also, I looked to my left (North) and vertically upward and could see lights of the 2 craft hovering in the same position above me. Still only could see each as a dim yellow light, with a red flashing beacon light next to it. I was not interested in them, and did not pay much attention to any of their specs. I turned my attention back to the spinning 'star'. I was clearly spinning and showing fantastic lights. Binoculars confirmed the object to be round, spinning , and multi coloured. No further definition. I was panicking at what to do next. I did not want to lose the moment. I held my cell phone up at arm's length to the 'star' and it only appeared as a tiny white dot in the screen. At arm's length, I could see both the tiny picture dot on the screen and the actual 'star' in the distance, just above the phone. I knew that would show nothing in a photo.  I decided to try the movie application, thinking that it may better show the fantastic light show, rather than a still picture dot.  I brought my cell phone close to me and pressed the buttons to start the movie mode, and stretched my arms out again with the cell phone at arm's length trying to find the white dot ( the spinning star) again.  The dot was nowhere to be found on the screen, so I looked at the actual sky, and the 'star' was now just a teeny tiny dot in the dark sky. The same size as a star would expected to be. Far off in the distance out over Lake Ontario. This actual star in the night sky did not register on my camera screen at all now. It was too small. The spinning 'star' had gone. I looked back toward the 2 craft and saw only dark night sky. They were also gone. Higher in the sky over Lake Ontario was the constellation Orion. Because the night sky was so dark and clear, I could see all the stars, especially the 3 of the belt.  Following the belt downward, I could see Sirius. It was certainly not the spinning colourful object I had been watching. My cell phone has Stellarium on it. I opened the app and held my phone up to confirm Orion and Sirius, but I already knew them. I stood there in disbelief. I was angry. I was emotionally upset and frustrated. I had lost my chance to record the spinning object. I had been rushing in a frantic state trying to capture something I knew could end at any time. And I did not succeed. This whole event from first seeing them outside the other window to re-entering my home, lasted only about 10 minutes. It was fast and furious.  And now I was emotionally upset. Turned back to the door, I went inside and went on the Internet on a computer within steps of the door.  I Google'd Orion and Sirius and confirmed the stars I now saw were those I already knew.  But what happened to the larger spinning ball?  I walked over the doorway again, and stared up at the night sky, hoping it would happen again. But nothing. Dejected, I turned around and walked back inside. The clock on the cabinet showed  12:30am  WHAT??  I had just went to close the blinds at 9:30pm !!  Where did 3 hours go ??!!! As stated, the above activity was in a frantic state to try and not miss the event. It was in no way near a 3 hour event. I tried to pad the events' time by judging maybe I spent more time on Google searching Orion / Sirius. Even if I did that for 1/2 an hour ( which I believe to be grossly incorrect) and if I stood on the patio for 1/2 hour in frustration, I'm still missing a couple of hours of time. I was tired, angry, frantic.  I didn't know what do next. I paced around my home for 3 hours trying to calm down. Finally I gave up around 4am, and went to bed.  I don't know why this event made me so frantic and upset. It is now 4 days later, and I can't get it out of my system. I told family and a friend about it, and they gave me the typical sympathetic look like I've come unglued. Posting this on the website to share. I have no answers. Only more questions.;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724
Small ping pong ball size white orb swoops down over garage roof 30 feet away from witness and vanishes;2019-06-07 22:40:00;2-3 seconds;Small ping pong ball size white orb swoops down over garage roof 30 feet away from witness and vanishes I feel it important to report what was witnessed:  On Friday, June 7, 2019, I was on my deck at home in Oshawa, Ontario  Had a friend over to sky watch After we both witnessed two separate slow moving bright white lights Would in 5- 7 seconds just fade out - gone ! Time between both sightings after 10:00 - 10:30 pm  The one to report to you leading up to this is quite shocking At about 10:40 I stood up with a feeling Walked across my deck to turn around to now face eastward Within seconds looking witnessed a incredibly fasting moving white orb type It's size would be that of a ping pong ball or just little smaller Very small white within this small object - illuminated light It came from the east and swooped downward over my garage roof Like skipping over and then hooked in upwards motion and then vanished on the lift up I would say I was no more than 30 feet away what I had just witnessed I have seen them much higher above on as bigger object lights Yet this one being so close and it's size so small Ponders was it biological or other unknown origin ? So close and so small is the shock factor for me;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724
