High Slow Long Dark Object Flashing A Blue Bright Light;2016-07-03 11:04:00;4 minutes;High Slow Long Dark Object Flashing A Blue Bright Light. On Sunday, July 3, 2016, while outside my home in Oshawa, Ontario, enjoying a tea and smoke, noticed something odd in the sky I was facing west over Whitby, Ontario.  As I'm close to Whitby's township western Oshawa About a quarter mile away near directly west Observed a long dark object, flashing a very bright blue light It was quite high in the sky - thousands of feet?  When I first observed it in the sky - appeared near stationary  This bright blue flashing light was so intense as it now started to move quite slow I then grabbed my camera and started to photograph  It then moved towards the west quite slow after another minute Last two minutes of the sighting it was now moving southwest towards over Lake Ontario It had drawn closer to me may eighth of a mile - still quite high  As it came into the clouds this dark colored object appeared to morph into a distinct  defined shape This shape as you view the picture resembles a letter or number    S   or  5   Please remember it first appeared longish - no bends  Then lost visual as it moved into the clouds or above Last picture taken 11:08 am   As you examine all the pictures shared Yes- looks very bizarre with different shapes and even one with a smaller sphere close to the larger dark object  They just continue;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724

I thought to share my first UFO sighting today- Jan.1, 2017, @ 2:02 pm est I went outside at home in Oshawa, Ontario, to have a smoke on my deck facing west Camera ready in my pocket due to  'very ' clear sky displayed Felt to capture a UFO After a few minutes noticed quarter mile away- directly west over Whitby, Ontario.  A very high near stationary brilliant shimmering white longish object  It was NOT round - more oblong Without the shimmering light It would be hard to see due to very high altitude  After about thirty seconds I pulled out my camera and started to film it It moved very slow and moved towards my house - Having this on and off shimmering effect  Quite high to zoom in on with my camera I took in total forty pictures - zoom on /off  After four minutes into the sighting It came directly over my position as I continued to film it Heading once over, traveling slightly southeast pass the roof Heading eastward slightly south over Oshawa Attached are thirteen pictures that were successful in capturing this unknown object I lost visual once passing over the roof. Last picture taken time was at stamp 2:08 pm The sighting last about six minutes - as at times looked stationary Enjoy the photographic evidence including enhancements ((NUFORC Note:  Photos indicate tiny, blurry specks in the sky.  We are unable to verify that the specks are authentic alien spacecraft.  PD));43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724
