green fiery oval shaped craft;1970-06-01 15:00:00;5 seconds;green fiery oval shaped craft I have long wanted to get this event in writing, even though it happened 30 plus years ago. It was definitely unidentified whatever it was.  I was nineteen at the time and i lived in a house that overlooked the city of Oshawa and Lake Ontario nearby. I was sitting looking out a large picture window that faced south towards the city. I observed a large fiery green oval craft flying from west to east. I had a good view of it and i clearly saw what appeared to be two red lights in orbit around the large craft. Actually it was difficult to tell whether they were in orbit or attached to the larger craft, but i thought they were in orbit.  The sighting lasted about five seconds the craft itself appeared not to be high in altitude. I've never seen anything like it in the sky before or since.
