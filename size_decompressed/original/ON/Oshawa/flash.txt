Rapid white flashes  witnessed,acknowledging in thought of a presence for a sign in the night sky *;2009-09-17 05:35:00;10-12 Seconds;Rapid white flashes  witnessed,acknowledging in thought of a presence for a sign in the night sky * I was up early in the morning at 5:20am,and made a tea.I went outside to my deck,still half asleep.I looked up at the nightsky,noticing all the stars above.I thought in my mind-Show me a sign your watching me  Again in thought.As I'm looking directly above,within a few seconds.I witnessed a white flash--pause [2-3 seconds], then 3-4 rapid white flashes--pause [2-3 seconds],then one more SINGLE white flash. What is this ??-morse code i thought ?  All flashes were in the same part of the sky.In shock,I stared looking for anything else-like running lights or other flashes.I witnessed nothing more after five minutes and went back in my home fully awake.In honesty,I don't even believe it ! Though,two more sightings did happen that were filmed.Again these sightings followed in the afternoon that day, Sept.17,2009 in Scarborough. I will submit the other two sightings to you-as there may be a connection happening here of contact.Those will have excellent pictures;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724
