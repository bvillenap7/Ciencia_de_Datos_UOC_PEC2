UP to 7 silent orange lights seen hovering for quite a while. ((Vandenberg rocket launch.  PD));2002-10-14 22:30:00;15-20 min.;UP to 7 silent orange lights seen hovering for quite a while. My wife and I were watching tv around 10:30ish. We live on the sixth floor of an apparment building. To the east, there appeared to be 2 or 3 orange coloured lights coming towards the apt. (this happens frequently as we are apparently in the flight path of the Oshawa airport). The only thing was, the lights did not get any closer. They seemed to possibly be about 1 mile away from us I suppose (it was hard to tell this). They hovered for a while. Eventually, as time went by, at least 7 lights were seen by both of us. I used binoculars to try and see more, but all I could make out was the orange lights and nothing else, except for what seemed like smoke/steam/exhaust? coming from them at times. This stream of exhaust seemed to go up into the sky quite a ways. We heard no sound and the night air was calm. If there were 7 helicopters hovering in the night sky, I'm sure we would have heard something. Then they were gone. Just wanted to add to the other reports I have read about on this web site.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Couple catch strange orange light on video;2003-03-18 20:10:00;approx: 40 sec;Couple catch strange orange light on video HBCC UFO Research received a video clip today (March 19, 2003) which was taken by a couple of witnesses from their residents in Oshawa, Ontario on March 18, 2003 at 9:10 PM Eastern Time.  What it shows is the Moon, in which they were filming in the first place. But then something else showed up on the film after they brought the cam, and tape back inside to view. They sat down to watch what they took and noticed an orange colored light around the Moon. As it was cloudy out, which can be seen clearly in the video clip, this light seems to bounce around on the film. I have sat and watched it for a while, and I am thinking that the light may be from some other light source, earthly. But  I am no expert at breaking down a clip from a tape. Why I am thinking this light may be of an earthly origin, is due to the movment of the cam at the time, and the light moving with the cam, or the Moon which was being filmed at the time. I having the video clip checked out and I am sure this should help in finding out what this light is. If anyone else would care to view the clip, which is 485 kbs, you are welcome to contact me at hbccufo@telus.net ((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to Brian Vike, Director of the Houston, British Columbia, Canada UFO Research organization, for sharing this report.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Update: Light seen and video taped in Oshawa, Ontario.;2003-03-18 21:10:00;40 sec;Update: Light seen and video taped in Oshawa, Ontario. Update for Oshawa, Ontario - March 18, 2003  at 9:10 PM Eastern Time HBCC UFO Reports it was certainly a light source which caused the light which showed up on the video tape. But it was not the reflection from the moon as it was suggested. When I viewed it, over, over and over again it looked to me as if there was another type of light source which caused it to show up on the film. Looks like I was right at least on this one. But one never knows for sure and is always worth looking into. My many thanks to the folks who took the video for their trying something to finally answer this puzzle. Below is an email message from the person who sent me the clip. Take care Brian HBCC UFO Research Dear Brian, Thank you sooo much for your letter and taking the time to view the recording.  Truly appreciated.  With all that you mentioned...I decided to retry the recording at the same  time last night and found out that I could see it again but once I turned out a light I had on it disappeared, so you were right on with the explanation of a reflection.  And here I thought I had some incredible phenonomen...*grin*  Darn!!!!  :-)  Thank you again for your time and just hope I did not take too much of it up, knowing now what it is....God bless....and keep up the great work on your wonderful site.

Hovering lights over Oshawa Airport;2006-07-10 00:00:00;60 seconds;Hovering lights over Oshawa Airport The date of this sighting is not exact I'm sure, but it was early to mid July 2006.  Now I wasn't here to post just to read up on Oshawa sightings.  Until I read a couple, and I know the  area well.  (Polish hall, Airport, Apartment buildings around Airport.) These are all areas In the northern unlit part of the city, just entering the country and farm type area.  My apartment building is right beside the airport and I'm on the 11th floor.(good view)  The other sightings are what caught my attention, they are similar to my own.  On my balcony I was watching these lights hovering over the airport, yet there was no sound no movement...............nothing. I hear the helicopters take off and land every day and all the other types of aircraft as well.  I would know the sounds off by heart without even looking out the window.  This freaked me out.  My girlfriend was very excited so I kept telling her to listen.  It was so silent yet there these lights were mabey 150ft from the groung and less than a quater mile from my building.  She got spooked by the silence then the power in our apartment turned off.  Just our breaker in the power box poped.  All other apartments had no power interuption. To see this for yourself..................wow.  I know my aircraft and this felt like a ghost.  No noise at all.  What aircraft is able to hover with no engine noise? The lights never flew away, they just dimmed then turned off.  Like the aircract was still there and just turned its lights off.  Any other Oshawa sightings like this?

Three Low-Slow Bright White.  Single Lights.;2013-06-03 22:23:00;5 minutes;Three Low-Slow Bright White  Single Lights I still amazed today. To report to you. Exactly what HAD BEEN WITNESSED June 3, 2013, at about 10:23pm est. These ' three ' separate UFO sightings Occurred here in southwestern Oshawa bordering Whitby, Ontario. Total time on and off witnessing all three were between 10:23pm to 10:43 pm  Here is my testimony as follows :  While walking my dog down the park near the creek and mature trees I was looking up above a large tree to the southwest some hundred yards away Above the tree high in the sky - maybe a guess between 2000- 5000 ft. I notice a bright slow moving white light coming over. Instantly I grabbed my camera to film it. As I film it and watch in awe It's now just slowly hooking north and even going slower. It's movement had a slight jiggle to it Moved about under  'half the speed ' of a Cessna Then it just fades out and is now gone under one minute when first noticed. Of course I just shake head and pick up the dog's leash and put my camera back in my pocket. As I continued walking the dog for a about another minute I now see another one moving from the west overhead heading east Being so in shock observing this bright single white light I drop the dog leash again and pull out my camera and start filming the second one. I watched it for about two to three minutes from the start to the end. This single bright white light travelled directly over my home heading eastern Oshawa on a straight flightpath It moved too slow to be any type of conventional aircraft. Talk about being shocked times two now. So once again, I grabbed the dog's leash from the ground Put my camera in my pocket shaking my head once again in wonderment. Continuing to walk the dog heading south across a road and into another park Then I now see a third one coming from the south - It started out quite bright as again I pull my camera to film. Within about thirty seconds The intensity of the light starts to fade to aqua- blue light. Then starts moving even slower and starts fading in intensity As I watched it travelling in the likeness a a star light - blue - white Still looking, now to be so much more  'higher ' in altitude heading north just west of my position. The speed was very slow and had that jerking motion  This was a first timer for me to witness three separate slow - low white ones at night here.  One really does wonder by thought and feelings what is about up there here. Guess I found my answer and along with photographic evidence to share.  I have noticed these types since Summer 2009 at night. They are out early June and in more numbers no doubt from my eyes. Best time between 9:30pm to 11:30pm Summer /Fall  Amazing enough I contacted a friend out of northern Whitby the next day He and his wife also witnessed and video taped the same type It has been posted on YOUTUBE He had captured excellent footage for visual detail on these slow anomalous white lights reported.  I will send all good still shots and one video clip to you in evidence.;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724
Bright white light  traveling fast heading southeast.;2014-06-03 04:25:00;5 minutes;Bright white light  traveling fast heading southeast. 4:25 am, over Oshawa, Ontario, 2 of us were out side talking before we left for work looking at the sky observing a satellite when we saw a bright light traveling at a high rate of speed from northwest to southeast.   No flashing lights, no sound, moving in a straight line, much faster then the satellite.   We were watching it had no tail to indicate a meteor we lost sight 5 min later, when it went past our line of site behind the rooftops of the other houses;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724
Green light.;2014-11-10 00:00:00;5 seconds;Green light. I went out side to have a smoke and I saw a bright medium green ball of light in the sky with a tail it lasted 5 seconds, it was so low in the sky that it disappeared behind my complex unit;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724
Two low white oval shaped lights staying stationary;2016-03-03 23:35:00;10 minutes;Two low white oval shaped lights staying stationary Here we go again... On March 3, 2016, while walking my dog after 11:30pm, I turned to the east and noticed something odd in the sky.  It was very cloudy and I observed two white oval shaped dim lights at a great distance,..1-2 miles. (?)  They both looked lower then the cloud ceiling. Maybe even less than a thousand feet.  Thought to dismiss them as lower smaller white clouds passing by Yet after about five minutes noticed they were still there in the same area of the sky eastwards. They appeared white colored and oval in shape sitting stationary They were not that bright yet one could just make out the outline . So again, looking at them now decided to pull out my camera take some shots, after again looking at them on and off for about five minutes. I just walked on to go on home as they were still there. Not sure of the source Please note these are not light flares **   Attached are three pictures [11:40pm ] that I took portraying what it was that I saw. This was my first sighting for me in 2016 Walking the dog every night we sometimes see things moving about along with appearance that is odd at night to question *;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724
Falling white light with flashing colours;2016-04-24 22:00:00;10 seconds;falling white light with flashing colours Walking dogs between 9:30-10pm.  Sorry, but I'm not sure of exact time as I didn't know about this site.  Looked to the south in the direction of Lake Ont. and saw what I thought was a falling star.  It was quite bright in comparison to other stars we see in our area and falling straight down. about 3 seconds before it left my view it began to flash red and blue. It seemed as though the red and blue were under one another and not the same spot flashing.  From what I remember, the white light wasn't showing when the colours started flashing.;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724
Masquerading Star Moves And Fades Out When Realized Not A Star.;2017-07-08 23:26:00;30- 40 seconds;Masquerading Star Moves And Fades Out When Realized Not A Star. Out walking my dog at a local park in Oshawa, Ontario July 8 ,2017.  As soon at the park looking directly west  Something was not right with there being ' three ' bright stars in a row All three were in a row across the sky looking straight west  One star there extra I thought ? I had realized in my mind- not be a star ?  Should only be two I thought Just then as I'm watching the three stars  The center one started to move very slow directly north losing light intensity I grabbed my camera to capture the moment @ 23:26 pm est It just then faded out gone ! Again the feeling of masquerading to appear like star/planet Please note : I have seen this type of sighting before here in Oshawa Needless to say the pictures came up empty Based on what I had witnessed Do wonder about the power outage hiccup that occurred earlier here at 10:10 pm Timing is uncanny ((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from this witness.

((anonymous report));2017-11-08 18:30:00;20 seconds;Medium sized ball of light came out of nowhere while we were driving on our left side up in the sky.  It was moving slowly downward, but not straight down, almost like someone would fall if they had a parachute on like a casual landing.  Then it got closer to us and disappeared out of nowhere.  No sounds.  No smoke.  No trail.  Just disappeared ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724

Four Separate UFO Sightings Within Two And One Half hours;2018-04-30 21:07:00;On and off two- one half ;Four Separate UFO Sightings Within Two And One Half hours On April 30, 2018 while at home in southwestern Oshawa, Ontario, I went outside for a tea and smoke after 9:00 pm  After a few minutes looking up and around the sky facing west towards neighboring Whitby, Ontario I noticed near above my house a slow low faint white light moving north 9:07 pm  The light would brighten some and then would fade out - disappear seconds at a time The flight path looked near straight and continue north until out of view Watched it for under two minutes wondering ? Intrigued I stayed outside looking again around the sky Then had a urge to again look above the roof Shocked I see another one coming in from the north to south around 9:25 pm It was heading directly towards over my position quarter mile away As I now stood up watching it as again would brighten up or then just fade right out It moved on a slight turn [ over my house] heading southeast towards Lake Ontario As I watched it high in the sky moving slowly when it appears You could see it rocking slightly side to side Tried to film it heading southeast - too distant and faint light Then after couple minutes lost sight of it There was no sound heard what soever Again just a white slow light - no other colors I then went inside my house again wondering Later , after 11:15 pm returned outside on my deck Curious sat down and looked about the sky Again after a few minutes to the west Maybe two three miles away see another one high in the sky Same characteristics as the previous two types witnessed This third one was moving from south to north It appeared to be going straight yet would fade and appear for 10- 20 seconds apart The sky appeared clear and watched it head north until out of sight Sighting lasted couple of minutes or more  Now having seen three UFO sightings of the same type I felt excited to witnessing three in one night - not the first time Again due to wonderment stayed outside I believe about five minutes later looking about west , north and south I had a urged to again look above my roof While sitting in the chair stretched forward and looked up Shocked I see these really bright pulses of white light Just like a camera flash in the dark I immediately stood up with my camera in hand still shocked looking up The pulses were intermittent flashes After about 4-5 of brightest large flashes Watching it move directly from north to south over house These flashes appeared very slow in movement The pulses then got much smaller after first ten seconds There may have been six to eight smaller ones Then it just stopped near above my house I could hear and see no aircraft at the time No running lights seen Only these extreme bright white bright light flashes  I'm still in a awe coupled in a state of shock in wonder Is this a form of visual contact by non human ? In conclusion even I don't believe it Yet it is still happening of all I seen and have filmed reporting to you Sorry there is no photographic evidence on this date witnessed After the flashes stopped 30 - 40 seconds Turned on my camera video ON filmed for any further pulses I gave up after one minute There were no more I then went back inside still shocked The real question I thought of the four I had witnessed ? Were they all the same one flying about ?  I feel it a duty as citizen of the world to report this to you Please note this is no joke I have totaled my witnesses and well on film There is something unknown in different forms truly flying in our airspace here How can anyone sat on their hands witnessing so much since 2003 This substantial increase in numbers again started 2015 Continues to increase this year 2018 Thought this very important to share with you Peter Would be curious if there others like me reporting this to you Only those that are sky watchers could relate if they also are under a form of contact Best regards  ((name deleted));43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724
Light flies really fast then makes an extremely sharp turn and fades into distance;2020-03-17 23:45:00;10 seconds;Light flies really fast then makes an extremely sharp turn and fades into distance Myself and 3 other friends were smoking cigarettes on our balcony when we noticed a really fast moving white light(non-blinking).  We live near an airport and are used to many planes coming in and out of where we live, however this was moving much faster than any plane.  I initially told my friends it was the ISS moving so fast, I've never seen anything fly this fast in person before.  As soon as the light got to it's maximum speed it quickly made a SHARP turn and started to fade.  I'm an amateur pilot with about 100 hours of flight training and I can tell at that speed the G's would have been way too intense for any human being to endure.  I'm unsure exactly what it was but we cannot deny that we all saw it, we were all extremely freaked out afterwards.;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724

This one's direction was from south to north directly west where I sat The brightness reduced dramatically after 5- 8 seconds , then faded out gone ! Then again at 9:35 pm witnessed a third one Resembling again like the first two like a starlight - whitish blue This one came from the northwest heading overhead southeast - faded out Then about 9:55 pm  Again I witnessed another one heading the direction of last one witnessed  Then after 20- 30 seconds witnessed another one - same direction Then another one following the first two counting them now to three They just kept coming [ 4,5,6,7,8,9-- - 40 +] one at a time like a train of single star lights This was going on for near ten minutes until the last one As I called a friend in neighboring Whitby,Ontario to go out and see these things While watching and talking to him on the phone Navigated him where in the sky to look Then after about near 40 + gone by there were no more Still chatting with my friend by speaker phone After couple minutes - More started to cross the sky - like a second wave Same characteristics in speed and separate distant apart in a line flight path 20 - 30 seconds at a time apart This second line of objects now were three- five degree west Yet still followed southeast direction from northwest Now my friend could see them watching and still chatting by phone After about 20 single objects had passed over Both of us noticed the last one had stopped As if took position to masquerade like a star I do understand about the presence of star link satellites Yet in this episode witnessed feel is a little more then that to report Just theorizing maybe that ALL are NOT star link satellites ?
