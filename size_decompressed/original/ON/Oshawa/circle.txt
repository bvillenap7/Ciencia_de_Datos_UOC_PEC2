Four large red circles in night sky;2013-03-16 20:10:00;5 minutes;four large red circles in night sky Looking east from our location we noticed four red solid circles, each about the size of a dime.   They were halfway up into the night sky, well into seemingly space, yet close enough to us to seem withing the atmosphere.  They were positioned in a diamond sequence as if the four coners of something huge.  We stood in awe, they did not move, change colour or brighten-dim, but one by one went out sharply as if turned off by a switch.   No noises, just went out one by one.;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724
Strange Bright Light Beside the Sun.;2013-12-10 09:14:00;5 minutes;Strange Bright Light Beside the Sun I was driving southbound on Stevenson's Road (south of the 401) and notice the sun was unusually bright even though it was a pretty clear day.  It was early in the morning (~9:15am) so the sun was not high up in the sky (just above Lake Ontario).  I then noticed that the sun was to my left and another bright light was to the right.  My first thought was it was a reflection of some sort from the sun bouncing off the clouds, but it was just very unusual how it only reflected off of one spot. I thought to myself this was beautiful and decided to take a photo with my cell phone camera (while driving).  As I started taking pictures and getting closer to the lights I realized this was some sort of phenomena.  I then had to turn right (westbound) onto Wentworth and decided to pull over and get a still shot.  I rolled down the window and took a clear shot of the lights then I zoomed in a little closer and took a couple more shots. Then within a matter of less than a minute the light started to fading or slowly disappearing. The light now turned into a small beautiful rainbow as the cloud disappeared and then eventually the rainbow also disappeared. I did not think anything of what I saw as a mystery, but just beauty. When I got to my office I downloaded the photos to do a review then to my surprise I now am noticing an orange dot in some of the photos.  I did not see this with my eyes while observing the bright light.  It seemed to have been moving and one shot shows the dot very near to the bright light.  It is the dot(s) that are making me believe that I witnessed some sort of a UFO.;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724

High Bright Round White Light--Excellent Video Clip.;2018-06-13 18:56:00;~1 minute;High Bright Round White Light - Excellent Video Clip Today, June 13, 2018, while outside on my deck Oshawa, Ontario  Having a tea and smoke looking about in the sky  Please note that we had just had a thunder storm couple hours earlier So the patches of blue sky were quite clearer than normal After about twenty minutes looking about mostly west - north and south Noticed very high in the sky directly west over neighboring Whitby, Ontario  Looked some miles away west  A very bright round white light appeared to moving across the sky Instantly, I grabbed my camera beside me on the table Looked into the camera eye viewer and started to film It appears to be racing towards the clouds  As well going through the clouds really illustrates it's brightness of the entire object. That when I lost view of this unknown in or above the clouds Please note that also the clouds were moving quite fast from the west I cannot be sure if truly this bright light could have been stationary Though just for verification waited ten - fifteen minutes for some more clear patches of blue In the same area of the sky could not see anything further So hence maybe it was not stationary As mentioned have seen two other sightings June 9 @ 9:44 am Also June 11 near 7:00 pm - two bright unknowns side by side witnessed Both these sightings have been photographed Will later file these two other reports with still shots for both Thanks again;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724
30/08/20  22:25 hrs  3-5 min duration Oshawa, Ontario Large pulsating bright red translucent orb;2020-08-30 22:25:00;3 minutes +;30/08/20  22:25 hrs  3-5 min duration Oshawa, Ontario Large pulsating bright red translucent orb At approximately 22:25hrs. on Sun. Aug.30,2020 was outside talking to a family member on the phone in the south end of Oshawa, Ontario, where I live and is within 5 min. walk to Lake Ontario. My neighborhood is in a direct line for small aircraft traveling from W. to E. with low altitudes between 3,000ft-12,000ft.  E. to W. corridor for small craft fly a few km's to the North of City.  Commercial flights use same corridors but at altitudes of 20,000ft - 35,000ft.  (Occasional Police & Search/Rescue Heli's w/ powerful searchlights can be seen flying low near Lake Ontario's coast in all directions) Weather on this night is clear with a near full-moon coming around from the East and no clouds visible in the West over the Lake at that time. I noticed what appeared to be the usual small aircraft traffic coming from W.-E. A small plane at approx. 3,500ft-5,000ft. with standard flashing night-time lights. I then spotted another craft flying in the same direction roughly 1,000ft to the north and approx. 500ft-1,000ft lower than the first and did not appear to be in dangerous proximity to each other although unusually close in my experiences watching planes. Also, I took notice of the first craft maneuvering away in a lazy South-East direction to put some more distance between them which also told me that the pilot had most probably seen it and took avoidance measures. I could not identify what kind of craft the second lower flying one was. It was over Lake Ontario, traveling West to East and flew about as fast as the other at first but its speed varied at times, slowing or speeding up but also making altitude adjustments, up and/or down with no rhyme or reason. It was circular in shape, like a very large orb.  I couldn't be sure of its size due to not having a reference such as clouds for scale, but seeing the other craft taking proximity avoidance maneuvers and comparing both, I would estimate that it was at least the same size or 50% larger than what may have been a Cessna. I ruled out a drone due to its size and speed. The strange thing about this unknown craft was its color and what it was doing.  It was as bright as a flood-light but a deep, deep red. It pulsated in brightness with almost translucent properties.  I immediately thought of those 'Chinese Lanterns' but also ruled them out when I realized that the pulses of red light had a specific frequency and did not 'flicker.' The pulsating 'Orb' went from really, really bright, would dim a bit then pulsate brightly again and again.  This happened for almost 3 t0 5 minutes while I watched completely gobsmacked. I even hung up on my sister to go get my binoculars in the house. It was still there when I came back out but was not able to focus on it before it pulsed a few last times then suddenly just stopped and disappeared. I searched all over that area with my binoculars under clear skies and a near-full moon. Did not see it again but it bothered me enough to google this web page and report what I had seen.  Hope this account doesn't mak! e me seem like an idiot and hope I didn't overdo it.  Thx.;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724
