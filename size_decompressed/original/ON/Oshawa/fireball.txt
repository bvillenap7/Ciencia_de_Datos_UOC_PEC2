Roound red ball that dripped then shot out of sight;1973-06-01 00:00:00;5 min;Roound red ball that dripped then shot out of sight A red dot in the sky cought my eye. as i watched it it seemed to be comming down slowly closer to the roof of the house across form me.  There was no noise.  I still thought it was a plane, but as it came closer I thought this is going to hit the house. I watched as it grew from the size of a dot to a base ball and now was the size of a basket ball.  It was round and red.  It then stopped and hovered abouve the roof of the house.  I was standing at my fornt door .  I turned and yelled to my husbqand to come out.  When I turned around it was gone.  My hauband had joined me and we searched the sky for what I had seen.  Then I spoted to my right -high in the sky again looking no rarger than a golf ball.  It again was still -   Then I saw three drops taht would best be discribed as looking like wax dripping. Three drips. Then the objuect shot straight up at a fantastice speed and was gone out of sight inless than a second. My husband clearly saw the last part of this. I am reporting this althought I have never reported it again because I have never heared of any one seeing such a thing and would very much like to know if anyone else has ever reported such an item in the sky. I know it was very long ago but I remember it very clearly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724
Bright light/flash streaking accross the sky in;2007-10-27 19:00:00;5 seconds;bright light / flash streaking accross the sky in My wife and I were travelling in our van east bound on Whinchester road, approaching Simcoe street in Oshawa.  It was about 7:00 PM.  It was a cloudy and overcast night.   In the sky we saw a bright flash of light and a white fireball fly past us high in the sky.  I don't believe that it was a meteor or a 'shooting star', because it flew under the dense cloud cover and it streaked accross the sky and didn't seem to be descending, but maintaining its altitude.;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724

Once mellowed out, they became not as bright but still pinkish/red in color and almost seethrough.  Was not a plane of any sort. no flashing probe lights and a plane could not manouver the way these objects did.  There was about 5 minutes in between each one.   Very eerie and unusual?
