V shaped formation of diamond shaped lights over Oshawa Ontario.;2009-10-19 01:41:00;20 seconds;V shaped formation of diamond shaped lights over Oshawa Ontario. It’s 0146hrs Mon, Oct 19/2009, I just saw a ‘V’ formation of lights fly right over my house @ Simcoe & Elm St. in Oshawa.   It/they were traveling very fast and absolutely NO noise, as it continued flying North to South towards Lake Ontario.  The lights were an odd blue/grey/white, like they were perhaps phasing in and out or maybe a color just barely visible in the human color spectrum.  I've never seen anything like that before.;43.9181504310346;-78.865309051724
