3 lights rotating around each other, changing from red to blue to green.;2004-10-20 01:00:00;2 minutes;3 lights rotating around each other, changing from red to blue to green. 3 lights rotating around eachother, kind of zig zaging back and forth across the sky. the objects were too far away for me to determine a shape, but they changed back and forth from blue to red to green. they did not move like planes or other known forms of aircraft, they were much slower. i was sitting on my roof and the crafts travelled north to south east, kind of floating without much deliberation. they changed colours at the same time.

white star shaped light moving around in the sky at speeds too slow to be a plane or moving star.;2007-06-29 03:00:00;about 5 minutes;white star shaped light moving around in the sky at speeds too slow to be a plane or moving star. At about 3:00 am i left through my back door into my backyard too have a cigarette.  As i lit my cigarette and casually smoked it i glanced into the sky.  There was a star shaped light that was illuminating brighter then anything else in the sky.  The reason i found this odd was because about a week earlier i saw something very similar with two of my friends.  The light was moving too slowly to be a shooting star.  If it were an airplane i would have seen some sort of red and blue lights ( as in safety hazard lights) which were not seen.  The light will slowly weave though star formations and will gradually decrease in illumination until it finally disappears.  I was amazed and bedazzled, which made me stay outside and watch the skies.  I was kindly rewarded with this ufo returning again following the exaxt same pattern.  If ANYONE can give me ANY kind of explanation please do so.;43.8716296460179;-79.2875719026552
