I had spent the night in Markham , Ontario, North of TOronto  at my son's house as I live too far to go home to Peterborough, Ont. when I teach at night.  As we do smoke inside of the house, I got up around 6:30 and went right away outside to have a cigarette...(bad addiction but..) It was cool and crisp with a clear sky and a bit nippy. The sky was very clear.  The moon was there over the garage and also the usual little star that I see every morning as I leave early. To my surprise I observed a triangle shaped object that seemed to move towards the earth???? It got bigger and bigger as it came closer. I watched it on my frontlawn for approx. 15 minutes and then went back to get a coffe as I did not believe what I had seen! It was something I had never seen before.  I stayed inside for a few minutes and went out again and it was still there! I am not on medication, and do not have apocalyptic visions although I am aware of the Millennium anxiety.  I am a professional in my 50's (Technical French translator and part-time French teacher at the college level.;43.8716296460179;-79.2875719026552
