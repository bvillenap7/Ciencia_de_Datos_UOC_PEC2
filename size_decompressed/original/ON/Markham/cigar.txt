There was a lot of traffic and lots of clouds in the sky. I happen to look up because of the traffic and I saw this thing. It was the darkest black colour i've ever seen and this thing was huge. It could have been anywhere from 1 to 3 miles long. It was moving very slowly with no sound, in three dimentional directions. It waited in mid-air and a much smaller round silver object appeared. With some kind of ant sticking out of the front of it. This round silver object looked like some kind of craft not from this planet. The black thing to this day scared my wife so bad. To this day i believed that the black thing was not a craft but something that was actully alive. The reason why I say that the black thing might have been alive is because the way it moved. It was able to move three dimentional and I believe that this thing defenatly wanted to be noticed. I believe with that huge traffic jam other people had to see what we saw. At least some of them. This black thing was so huge and so powerful looking that It could be mistaken for a god. I wanted to pull over to the side of the road but my wife wouldn't allow me to have a better look at it.
