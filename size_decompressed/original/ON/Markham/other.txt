Light yellow in colour and it appeared exactly like the planet saturn but the ring was attached to the actual ball or body. No specific detail was evident. For it's distance from me, it was extremely large, judging by it's apearance relative to other things such as buildings. The object also had one flashing white light directly on top and one flashing light directly on the bottom of the craft. I was completely shocked.

I was completely shocked to say the least, I even went so far as to call the police but they told me they didn't know what they could possibly do. I called the local airport but got through to nobody. Every night, whenever I pass the area from which I saw it, I stop and look hoping to see just another glimpse of it. Oh yes, the object was stationary.;43.8716296460179;-79.2875719026552
Its was like two rectangles forming an obtuse angle of 130 degrees and below it, there was like a globe with some shadows.;2006-02-20 06:30:00;5-10 minutes;I work as an elementary teacher in a french school. I was getting ready to leave like I do every morning to take the bus. I just remember that it was in the winter and that it was still dark outside. We had a snowfall the night before and therefore each of my neighbors on both sides ( left and right) were busy shoveling the snow. I happened to look in the sky and there it was in front of me. Strangely enough, I did not say anything to my neighbors and I was not scared.  I was awed and I just stood there for a while and observed it. It did not have the shape  usually  reported in the newspapers. It was huge and grey. Its was like two rectangles forming an obtuse angle of 130 degrees and below it, there was like a globe with some shadows.  It was standing still in the sky right in front of me. I looked at my neighbors but I didn’t want to say anything. I decided to cross the street to have a better look. As soon as I did, I turned around to glance once more at the strange object and it was gone. It was just as if there had never been anything there in the first place. I am not making this up. I never told anyone but family and friends all this time. By the way, when I was a child, my parents did see a UFO. They always told me about it. It was then in the province of Quebec and it happened in the early evening. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));43.8716296460179;-79.2875719026552

This is a late reporting.  I was very interested in the 22 minute NASA video of something outside the space station on February 21, 2020.  Since that video was on the web I have heard no information regarding any explanation of what that was.    I saw something in the sky in approximately the 3rd last week of October 2019.  It would have been either a Friday or Saturday night as I often work till 10pm.  At about 1:40 am I was taking out some recycle items to the garage and as I often do, looking up.  I usually look for the north star and if visible Orion’s Belt, then maybe look to planets as I live in Markham, Ontario and there is a far bit of light from the city so we do not see a great number of stars often.  On this night I saw something I didn’t tell anyone because it looked out of place.  It looked like a giant, translucent squid.  However (to circle back to the NASA video) I have since found a video on YouTube from July 9, 2010  (china airport) of and ! I am certain the same UFO.  I have since looked at that video a few times on a large screen TV and I am positive it was the same thing ( creature, ship, capsule) not sure.  The thing that stuck me the most was I remember the thing what I would call “bursting through the air or some part of the air”.  I would estimate the height of travel to be about 60,000 feet as it was about twice the height of air travel, direction of travel was southwest to northeast.  Last thing it came into view for only a few seconds but when it was directly overhead it seemed to be the most translucent.   That is it.  I do hope one day we make that contact.;43.8716296460179;-79.2875719026552
