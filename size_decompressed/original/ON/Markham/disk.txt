Some could see these lights and others could not.I looked intensely in the sky for 5 minutes before I noticed the 2 lights that resembled stars dancing in a sparing way to each other. These lights were closer than the stars, in fact they were in our atmosphere. Soon there were 3 lights moving crazily through the sky always in a localized area. After five minutes of searching the sky with a binocular I finally was able to zero in and the light revealed itself into the shape of a saucer.It moved similar to a wobiling spinning top. This continued for two hours.;43.8716296460179;-79.2875719026552
