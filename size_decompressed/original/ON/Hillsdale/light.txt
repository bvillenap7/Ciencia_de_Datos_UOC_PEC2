Dancing Lights Over Lake Simcoe.;2016-09-05 04:45:00;15;Dancing Lights Over Lake Simcoe. Had to retrieve an object from my car and noticed the light in the southeast sky over Lake Simcoe. It was flashing green/red/gold in no concerning pattern. It would rise then go left and right. There was only one. When I tried to video it, the camera would not pick it up, but the camera picked up stars near the object.  It suddenly rose to a high height and then just disappeared.
