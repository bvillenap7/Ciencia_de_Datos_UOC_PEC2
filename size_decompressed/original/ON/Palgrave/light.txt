(not flares, not planes) I had just gone out onto my back porch at 10:30pm to let my dog out, before going to bed, and she was acting weird.  She tried to ram her head through the screen door to get outside (she never does this!), and as I opened the screen door, I immediately saw three glowing orange balls in the sky flying west to east.  I screamed for my husband and son who both came running and witnessed the glowing orange lights.  They were flying in a triangle formation and were making no noise at all.   They were flying approximately 200 meters off the ground (maybe a little less) and travelled in a north east direction at a steady rate of speed.   Then a fourth orange glowing light flew in from the south west towards the three lights that were still flying in formation.  Then the three in formation blinked out and were gone suddenly.   The fourth glowing ball continued flying north east in the direction of the three that disappeared and then it stopped and floated without moving at! all for about 10 seconds and then it blinked out.   The night was clear and there was a full moon out.  My husband and I are skeptics by nature and definitely NOT UFO fanatics but there is no rational explanation for what we saw last night, other than a UFO.    WHAT are these things?;43.9525;-79.8388
