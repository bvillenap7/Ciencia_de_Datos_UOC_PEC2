Caledon / Palgrave Ontario amber / orange glowing oval orb above Hwy 50.;2012-05-09 00:00:00;10 seconds;Caledon / Palgrave Ontario amber / orange glowing oval orb above Hwy 50. Driving south on highway 50 just past Albion Hills and the Railroad Bridge,  Around 12am on May 9th 2012. Driving home from a friends house in Orangeville Ontario.  I saw what looked like a street light from about 200 feet away it had a amber/orange glow.  As I drove close I realized it was actually slowly floating over the road, it was about 40-50 feet above the road just over the telephone lines (very close) and about the size of a small to mid sized car it was oval/round I had another friend in a cor directly behind me , he witnessed everthing to. Just as I/we passed it, my friend started to text me that we should pull over to take picture but the only camera i had was on my Iphone 3gs (terrible camera at night) so I got home ok, but I was checking my rear view mirror the rest of the drive. I've been checking online to see if anyone else has repoted this but I haven't found anything. There was at least 1 car ahead of me and 2 cars driving northbound in the! oncoming lane when I was under it. nothing on my car stopped work.
