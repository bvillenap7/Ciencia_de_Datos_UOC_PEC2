So as I continued to shoot the sky a friend notices two objects appearing to be traveling together through the sky! I began to take a few photo’s still not realizing what I was taking pictures of when they finally flew up out of sight, was when I was able to take photo’s of an unidentified object launch straight up and as it reached a certain height it shot off to the left up into the clouds. I had my 75-300mm lens on my Rebel XTI the pictures do speak for themselves other than explain what they really are! As the on rises up, you will notice below it the forth one rise, yet as I view the photo’s there is at least one other object that is there in the sky as well. This lasted only while the sun was still shining light after the sun had set! Privileged to be able to take such photo’s;44.6088;-79.4251999999999
