HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Two orange lights  racing one another across the sky.;2003-12-05 17:43:00;approx: 4 or 5 seconds;Two orange lights  racing one another across the sky. Orillia, Ontario  Date:  December 5, 2003 Time:  5:43 p.m.  I received an email from a gentleman today, December 6, 2003 in which he explains both in an email and in a video clip of what he witnessed. I also telephoned the witness to find out a little more about the sighting. I had a nice conversation with him, and he went on to explain exactly what he saw. On December 5, 2003 (in the video clip the witness tells that the sighting took place on December 6, 2003. The sighting actually took place on December 5, 2003, a simple mix mistake) he saw a pair of unknown objects at 5:43 p.m. while out Barbecuing. When he noticed the two objects, his first thought was a couple of satellites were flying side by side. But he starting thinking this was really strange looking because one of the objects would quickly move past the other, then the object which then followed behind, would make the same moment and fly up a head of the other. The witness said it looked as if they were racing across the sky as each one tried to pass the other. He mentioned that the speed of these two unknowns was incredible as both moved so very quickly. The two objects eventually went into a cloud bank and disappeared. They were a very bright orange in color. An example he gave for the color and size of the two objects were that of the brightness and size of the planet Mars when it was at it's closet to earth.  The fellows son, at a different location from where his Dad was saw a single unknown object traveling south at a low rate of speed,  it quickly sped up and was gone. The reported time for the son's sighting was between 5:50 - 5:55 p.m.  Thank you to the Dad and son for their reports. Also the video clip will be placed to my website once the new site is completely sometime after Christmas. There are tons of updates and new material to be posted at that time.
