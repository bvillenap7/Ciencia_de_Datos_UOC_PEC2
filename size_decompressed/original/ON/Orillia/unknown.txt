(multiple Photo's) On Sun July 29th Me and a couple friends were coming back from taking pictures at the Big Chute a famous spot in Simcoe County, when I noticed the first object disappear before my eye’s. I was the only witness to this yet as we headed back into town there was a great spot for taking pictures of the sunset. We headed back to Orillia Ontario right at the intersection of Hwy #12 and Hwy #11 that’s where I started to shoot pictures of the sky. The clouds were awesome that night and the base of the sky was glowing orange. That’s when in the corner of my photo’s I noticed a couple of dots become brighter in my photo’s. So I continued to shoot the sky as well as the two objects reach the clouds, that’s when the 3rd one launched with a vapor trail up so far and the just as fast as it rose up it started to shoot off to the left. As I continued to take the pictures of this one, we noticed a fourth one in the bottom of my pictures! This one shot off through the sky up to the clouds! In total I have about thirty action shots of this object rise up from the ground in the distance and then literally shoot off to the right! As I went home and viewed the pictures there was a fifth one that had been sailing across the sky through the clouds yet this one was heading to the right.
