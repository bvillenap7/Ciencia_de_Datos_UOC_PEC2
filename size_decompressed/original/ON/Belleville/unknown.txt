we saw and heard something that isn't explainable.;2002-08-25 23:00:00;4 hours;we saw and heard something that isn't explainable. We were sitting in the backyard, in an enclosed porch. We first noticed some lights in the sky at 23:00hrs. When we looked at it through binoculars you couldn't make out the shape but you could see red, yellow, blue and green lights flashing on the object. At 00:00 we noticed another one in the vicinty. By 01:00 we counted 6. 5 of them were in a cluster to the NW, the other one was alone in the NNE. We saw a plane fly in the direction of the one in the NNE, it was much closer than the others, as the plane was getting closer it shot straight up in the sky. At 02:00 I saw a yellow flash of light at the front of the house, at the same moment my sister saw a blue flash of light in the back of the house. At 03:00 we heard a sudden noise in the backyard. It was like a vocal noise but you couldn't understand what was being said. At that point in time we ran into the house and locked the doors and closed all blinds. We then ran to my truck and sat there until my Aunt and Uncle came home. They then checked the backyard and nothing was there. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star.

strange object dicovered in movie footage.(dvd--U turn, w.Sean Penn  position in movie--116:10:15);2004-04-04 20:20:00;<1min.;strange object dicovered in movie footage.(dvd--U turn, w.Sean Penn  position in movie--116:10:15) while watching a movie(U-Turn) on dvd,a flash was noticed in the left foreground.it was the scene of a windy street(time 116:10:15),and at regular speed this footage appeared in fast motion for whatever reason.i decided to slow it down to see if i could make it appear normal.in this seen there was a sign hanging from a store front and this is what i used as a reference.when i slowed it down my wife noticed this quick flash appear between the upper portion of a corner building,and a post,in the upper left of the t.v. screen.i rewound,paused,and advanced the footage frame by frame.after the flash occurs,keep advancing frame by frame(a dozen or so) until a small light appears above the ridge in the background.about six or seven frames leading up to the light,will show the object ascending in a zigzag manor.each frame was 1/32 duration which would have this object ascending at a terrific rate of  speed,given the distance covered and the zigzag motion.it appears that as the object clears the ridge the sun catches it and illuminates it.in the very next frame it appears to be in the upper foreground as a slightly diagonal(from vertical)blip,(for the lack of a better word).those last two images appear to be miles apart in what would be a fraction of a second.if you back up from the lightframe far enough you will see the object descending near the ground between a bridge and a post.if this is the same object in the initial flash frame,then it has covered a great distance in a very short time,like,maybe a mile in a second or less!i hope someone will take this seriously and rent the dvd.i would also greatly appreciate a responce to this report.this is very much worthy of investigation.thank you.

Large object with multy colored flashing lights.;2004-08-24 02:30:00;approx. 20 minutes;Large object with multy colored flashing lights. Last night around 2:30 or 3 am my oldest son and I were watching the Starsky and Hutch movie. All of a sudden I saw what I woulda swore was a huge plane landing in this filed out back of our house behind a set of woods. It was huge and had blue, red, green, and yellow flashing lights.  We watched it for a second, dumb founded wondering why the hell would such a large plane be landing back there unless it was in trouble. So we ran upstairs to my office to get a better view over the trees and saw the thing rise up real quick then just kinda hover then bam it shot off to the north and was gone. Then about 15 minutes after that this big bright white light just appeared further off in the distance and stayed there for a bit and then started moving to the left and right then it shot up a ways, sat there, and then bam it too was gone. During the time the large craft was in our sight our satellite television kept screwing up, the picture going all frazzled. When the bright white light appeared later our Satellite went out again. I'm going up on our roof tonight with our video camera as I have spoken to two other people who have seen this that didn't know of my experience before telling me theirs. Hopefully I can catch something on tape.;44.1706602941177;-77.3837654411765
Looked out my kitchen window and noticed a bright light below the clouds. I was about to turn away when it sped off to the east quickly;2020-12-20 22:30:00;3 minutes;Looked out my kitchen window and noticed a bright light below the clouds. I was about to turn away when it sped off to the east quickly then stopped. It then flew close to the origin point, then went back east and did a large circle coming to rest where it began. It then got very bright and went up and disappeared up quickly into to he clouds for just a moment and returned. It then got bright and stayed there. I ran outside and got the neighbor on her deck. It was still there. After a moment, it turned red then flew back and forth very quickly about a mile or 2. It then turned blue and did some more. It then turned bright white once again. It then flew west very quickly then instantly turned South and disappeared from view. The movement was in no way a helicopter. The increase in speed and maneuvering was also incredible. As for a drone, no. I've seen the mothership drone in operation and also the range,speed and capability this was going, just nope.;44.1706602941177;-77.3837654411765
