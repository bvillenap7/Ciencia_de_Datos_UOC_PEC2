Blinking out Cigar;2002-07-07 20:03:00;1 minute;Blinking out Cigar I  was putting out the garbage at my job, when i was heading back into the store, i noticed a white object in the sky. The object had a strip on it from the top of it to the bottom of a golden or orange colour. The strange thing that caught my attention was the fact it was motionless as if it was frozen in the sky.
