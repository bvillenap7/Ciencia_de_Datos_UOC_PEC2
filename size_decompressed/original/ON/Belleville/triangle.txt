Seconds after the first passed, two more craft joined into a formation.   Three of the craft continued formation, the forth looped and zagged then returned to its place.  The craft appeared to be typical airplane shape - the triangular shape of a planes wings without the body of the plane. Maybe like a stealth?   The craft were bottom lit, the lights outlined the outside diameter, rather than one light on the tip, like the usual airplane.  The lights were a soft amber. None of us were able to hear engine noise. During this sighting, we were able to look away from the craft, verify that each other were seeing the same thing, then find the craft on route. Note, there is an air-force base to our north west, and to the west, a smaller airport. However, these craft appeared to be too high to land at a strip so close by.;44.1706602941177;-77.3837654411765
