I was standing out side with my telescope trying to aim it at a star, then as i looked to the left of me i saw a light moving slow glowing with large amounts of light until it pucked up speed decreasing in brightness until it disappeared... then there was another trailing after the other light doing the same thing until it disappeared... i stayed out longer to see if anything else happened but nothing turned up.
