4 Greenish Blue Blob-Like Objects Flashing Low In Southern Sky;2020-12-29 23:00:00;Seconds to 1 Minute;4 Greenish Blue Blob-Like Objects Flashing Low In Southern Sky Sometime between 23:00-23:59 I went outside for a smoke and looking South to SSW over the Bay and very low in the sky, I saw what looked almost like green to greenish blue scattered aurora borealis-looking blobs about the size in total of what'd amount to a small recreational boat, 3 to 4 of them in an almost diamond formation, each blob (btwn an orb and a disk, blurry edges) flashed in the same spot around 3 times each lasting about 3-5 seconds per flash and not in unison, and by the time I was intensely focused on it wondering what the heck it was (over the span of about 1 minute) they then disappeared and didn't reappear for the duration of my cigarette. It was about a pinky finger width up from the top of the tree horizon across the bay from me but it was between Belleville and Prince Edward County. It was silent, there was no noise at all unlike the hospital helicopter or aircraft I often see from Airforce Base. I haven't seen anything like that before actually, I'm not someone who writes these things ever, and have lived here 5+ years.;44.1706602941177;-77.3837654411765
