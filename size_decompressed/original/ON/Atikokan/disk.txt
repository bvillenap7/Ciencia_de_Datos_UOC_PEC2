It was very bright ..lit up the inside of the car when it was in front as it past us .... we tried to see what it was but the light was so bright between flashes our eyes could not focus in the short time between flashes....  when it was right beside our car it appeared to be about 35 to 40 meters long and about 5 to 10 meters deep....and it was shaped like an eye.   It then flew straight up at an incredible speed until it disappeared from sight.;48.75;-91.6167
