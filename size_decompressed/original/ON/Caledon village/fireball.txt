I was outside in my secluded house and seen what appeared to be a flashing slow moving fire ball in the sky. It was moving north west (I believe). It was only one. It travelled in a line and then disappeared.  Background of the observants were mixed race and black.  I have a short video that does no justice for how it appears in the sky.;43.8611;-80.0006
