Saw a distant orange light move through the sky unlike an aeroplane or helicopter;2003-09-14 23:00:00;30 Seconds;Saw a distant orange light move through the sky unlike an aeroplane or helicopter In 2003, a few weeks after the blackout in northeast USA and southern Ontario, I was out on my back porch looking at the sky. Looking at the street out front, I noticed an orange light high in the sky. It moved slowly to the left and was blocked by a tree. Dismissing it as a plane, it flew up into the sky at an incredible speed. There was one object, orange in colour, and not twinkling. The observer, myself, was an elementary school student at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));43.8796150326797;-79.4307032679735
