A soucer dissapearing infront of our very eyes;2001-12-29 00:00:00;15;A soucer dissapearing infront of our very eyes Me and my daughter where heading back home from a christmas party some time around midnight, we were driving down the highway and we saw some kind of glowing object high in the sky, we began joking around saying that it was ufo (thinking it was an airplane heading towards us and making it seem like a ufo from the bright light). We kept on looking at it and we freeked cuz it wasn't moving, so we desided to follow it, it looked like a bright light, but after driving for about 10 min it began looking like somekind of a saucer, we stopped on a quiet street watching it for about 3-4 min huvering in mid air about a 1 km over the ground, all of the sudden with great speed it zoomed down to the ground, ending up about 500 meters away from us and about 50 meters off the ground. It was there for about another minute or so and then all of the sudden it went into a big flash leaving us blinded from the light for about 2 seconds and then when we focused back in that area it was gone. It was truly the most incredibly wierd thing i have ever sen in my life. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));43.8796150326797;-79.4307032679735

Massive disc shaped craft, dark in colour with white and red lights.;2007-03-22 21:56:00;25 seconds;Massive disc shaped craft, dark in colour with white and red lights I was in the parking lot of Delta Bingo, when i saw one white light and one red light in the sky...and i stared at it and looked closer and i kid you not, i could see this huge dark craft saucer shaped, looked like it wasnt too high off the gorund, but the thing looked massive, and it appeared to have round circle, windows i guess you would call it around the side, then it simply vanished after i stared at it for about 25 seconds ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether this is a serious report, or not.
