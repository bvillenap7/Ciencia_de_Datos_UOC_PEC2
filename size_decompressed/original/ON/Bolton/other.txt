UFO Rod with 3 balls of light swayed for 2 seconds and disappeared.;2003-08-31 01:00:00;2 Seconds;UFO Rod with 3 balls of light swayed for 2 seconds and disappeared. I was sitting in my room at 1AM Sunday, playing on the internet. Suddenly, this long rod (about 10ft in length) came down. I can't remember exactly, but it had 3 bright white balls of light on it. It was about 30 ft from my window, hovering about 100 ft in the air. It quickly swayed back and forth, then took off out of nowhere. It just disappeared. The balls of light were so bright that they hurt my eyes. I quickly ran to the window to look for further evidence, but nothing was found. After a few minutes I went online again to see if my friends had seen anything, and one of them had seen something similar at the same time as me. He told me it was something bright.. which looked like a star going straight downwards across his house. We don't think these two occurences were linked but they did happen at the same time.
