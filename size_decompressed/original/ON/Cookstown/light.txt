White, vibrantly glowing light stationary above Cookstown for ~3hours.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??  PD));2010-07-31 21:30:00;~3 hours;White, vibrantly glowing light stationary above Cookstown for ~3hours. At about 9:30 pm on Saturday evening me and two others noticed a glow in the sky.  It was white, about a third the size of the moon & diffused.  We were simply talking outside in a unlit area on Regional Road 56 and this the sky was quite visible at the time.  There was intermittent cloud cover at the time.  At first it appeared to be a plane above the thin cloud layer & so I did not pay much mind to it. However when I checked back to it several minutes later the clouds have passed & I noticed that even a clear sky the object emitted still was glowing a diffused white light. It did not appear to be solid & I could not gauge a distance.  The other interesting thing was that it did not move at all in that time & when looking at it with peripheral vision - it seemed to flicker quite rapidly.  However one was unable to see the flickering when looking at it directly.  The flickering was somewhat random, & very rapid, not like a star. During the next roughly 3 hours as we! continued to observe the object, It continued to remain in the exact same location, flicker quite vibrantly & every few minutes it would seem to dissipate for a minute or so, only to return to the same location.  The flickering was quite prominent at times, to the point that it seemed to light up the sky quite visibly in the peripheral vision when not paying too much attention. At roughly 12:30 the object disappeared again but did not return this time. It remained stationary the whole 3 hours when looking south east @ roughly 30-40 degrees inclination.
