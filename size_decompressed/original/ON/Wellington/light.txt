3 lights zig zag extremely fast;2020-05-05 00:10:00;4 minutes;3 lights zig zag extremely fast Noticed what appeared to be a shooting star. Lift remained in place then shot across the sky diagonally then a second light shot across sky to where 1st light just was, first light then zipped diagonally again very very fast, second light again took the same place as first and a third light shot across sky to where the first one was noticed.  This zig zag pattern followed with each light taking up the spot the last one left.  Then all 3 lights, in the blink of an eye zoomed to the north east.  Started over lake Ontario.  These things moved incredibly fast, way to fast to be a airplanes.  Like 3 shooting stars.  So very odd, twinkled white amber to almost red.  No sound.;43.9571;-77.3542
3 zig zagging stars?;2020-10-12 03:00:00;4 minutes;3 zig zagging stars? I seen this same thing about 10 years ago over Lake Ontario in Prince Edward County. What looks like a shooting star goes across the sky, stops for about 20 seconds then zig zags to new position in sky ridiculously fast, then a second one falls the first ones original path and takes up the 1st position of the 1st light then they both zip to new positions and a 3rd follows these patterns. Eventually after many zig zags the first one zips out of site heading east north east. The 2 remaining stars continue to same point of departure before following same trajectory/path of the first. mckrae@msn.com;43.9571;-77.3542
