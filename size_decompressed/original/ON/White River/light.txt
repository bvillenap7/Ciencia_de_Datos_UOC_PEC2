Starlike object traversing night sky;2002-07-16 23:00:00;5 Minutes;Starlike object traversing night sky My Grandpa, Dad, close friend and I were in the Canadian bush on a fishing trip.  The stars are amazingly bright up there so one night while on our trip we stood at the back of the cabin just gazing at them.  My grandpa noticed a star-like light moving through the sky, I looked and noticed it also.  It was moving slow at first in one direction like a sattelite does.  We all started watching the object moving across the night sky.  Suddenly the object stopped and when backwards in the same path that it had just traveled, then it stopped.  Out of nowhere it took off and streaked out of sight within a fraction of a second.  All of us were dumbfounded and still are.
