A small light flew accross the night sky at tremendous speed.;2010-07-31 21:45:00;5 sec. app.;A small light flew accross the night sky at tremendous speed. July 31st and on August 2, 2010, both at approxiamately 21:45 hrs, a small white light (the intensity of Polaris) moved rapidly accross the sky about 25 degrees above the horizon due south from Hanover, Ont. I observed it crossing about 40 degrees of the sky in a west to east direction. It covered this span in 4 to 5 seconds. I have observed many planes and satellites over the years and nothing ever came close to this speed. There were no flashing lights, just the steady glow resembling a regular satellite. I could not estimate its' distance away. The sky was clear and many other stars were visible at the time. Many air routes pass by here so I am well aware of airplane lights.;44.1493;-81.0386
