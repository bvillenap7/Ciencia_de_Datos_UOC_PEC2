3 fast moving lights in the shape of a triangle.;2010-07-10 23:00:00;8 seconds;3 fast moving lights in the shape of a triangle. At approximately 11pm on 07/11/2010 there were 5+ witnesses of some strange lights moving SSE in a fluid motion faster than any aircraft.  The lights were in a triangle shape and at first we thought it was a triangle shaped craft.  But when I pointed out the object to a few more people with my green laser pointer the lights split apart in different directions in a fast fluid like motion and then disappeared.  The lights were pale white and were not as bright as the stars, they were also not blinking and there was no sound.  Total time of viewing was approximately 8 seconds. About 3 minutes prior to these lights there was another strange bright white light heading east towards where those 3 lights were spotted, but it changed direction and headed in the same direction as those lights would eventually head.  This light was brighter than a star, it looked to be about as high as a plane but it was moving much slower than a plane and much much slower than the 3 lights that would follow.  Again, there were no flashing lights or sounds with this bright light either.;44.1493;-81.0386
