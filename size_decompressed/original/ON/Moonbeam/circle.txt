Moving higher up,side to side after awhile I first saw 3 round lighted objects in the sky near and above my house around the middle of December 2013. This object stayed in one place for awhile, and would move up or down or side to side if I stared at it too long. The light from it would change to red and white at times. Later in January 2014 I only saw 2 objects above and near my home. It again stayed in one place for awhile, moved after a few minutes of staring at it, and color would change. I feel strongly a sense of invasion, as if it is studying me and the area??  Hard to explain it. I just don't feel comfortable in my own skin as I watch this object.  I do not know why. The objects are there till the wee hours of the night, I saw it around 2:00 a.m. as well. Note:  I am writing this because my sister is the one who sees this, her grandson 18 yrs old also sees it and her husband sees it too.  But my sister is afraid people will think her 'crazy' so she is afraid to report it.  Which is why I filled out your form with her name and info.  I spoke to her just now and is not willing to call your telephone # to report it.  So you can call me and I will pass on her info as accurately as possible.  Please do not call her but you may write to her I would think. P.S. This is not a joke, my sister is uncomfortably obsessed with these objects and is scared of not knowing what it is.  She has had many other encounters that are really weird and strange and unexplainable.;49.3529;-82.1475
