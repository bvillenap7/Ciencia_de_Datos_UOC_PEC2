Bright white pulsing egg shaped object moving from south to north.;2014-08-02 04:30:00;60-90 seconds;bright white pulsing egg shaped object moving from south to north I was watching the meteor shower approximately 4:30 am when I noticed a moving pulsing egg shaped white light that silently moved overhead from South To North. It did not appear to be at a low altitude but was not out of our atmosphere. Its movement was of a jittery fashion, it would pulse and move rapidly to a different part of the sky. I lost sight of it as my view was blocked by some trees, last seen headed North and still pulsing and moving rapidly.

Flickering orange light slowly moving east and then west at high speed.;2017-09-20 23:00:00;3 minutes;Flickering orange light slowly moving east and then west at high speed. While sitting on my front porch at about 2300 hrs., I noticed an orange light above the trees to the west south west.  I took it to be one of those lanterns that I have see before. After about 30 seconds it traveled east grew brighter and was flickering. I stepped into the house for a large pair of 15x binoculars that I use for ship watching.  My front porch faces west toward the St. Clair river that is about 1 mile at that point.  The object had grown even brighter by then and I found it intensely bright in my glasses. The object had the shape of a grain of rice and the surface seemed to be the source of the flickering light.  A bright pulse was moving end to end in about 1/2 a second or so.   I stepped into the front door to ask my wife to come and see but she was on the phone.  I stepped outside again a total of six or seven seconds and found the object in that time had suddenly retreated 30 miles or so to the west and was rapidly fading in the distance until it disappeared.  It must have be doing about 5 miles a second. The skies were clear and the stars were visible almost to the tree tops.  Visibility was 60 miles plus.  The entire event took about 3 minutes.;42.6561;-82.5103
