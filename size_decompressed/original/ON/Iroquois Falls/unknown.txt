For the past several months, my wife and I have seen a bright white light in our bedroom. This light lasts for only an instant and is unlike any light from a lamp or car light, At times it has been just a point of light,other times a bright white light that fills the room. A few nights ago the light was extremely bright and came in two quick pulses.The light does not come  at any set time or night, but appears randomly. My wife is getting rather upset and frightened at this, as we can find no explanation as to why this is happening. Does your organization have any records of such an occurance,or have any idea what these lights may be? We live in northern Ontario in Canada in a small town in our own house. We are both in our late 50's and retired. Thank you for your time.;48.5234;-80.3081
