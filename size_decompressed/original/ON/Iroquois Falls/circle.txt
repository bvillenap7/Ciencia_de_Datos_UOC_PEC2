Three, circular, low flying, objects, reflecting a red light, consecutively fly over a lake, following the same trajectory.;2014-08-09 21:45:00;30 minutes;Three, circular, low flying, objects, reflecting a red light, consecutively fly over a lake, following the same trajectory. On the night of the 9th of August, I and two others have seen three unidentified flying objects.  We have observed three low flying objects emitting a constant bright red fire like light.  The first was spotted as I and the other witnesses exited a lake we had been swimming in. We could not see the object, but we were sure that it was neither a plane, an asteroid, nor a comet, and it seemed too near to be a satellite.  The lake in question is about 10 km from Iroquois Falls.  The circular red light advanced at a slow and steady pace, not leaving a trail behind it, and followed a half moon like trajectory from the point where we had seen it, and lost it from view.   We exited the lake and spoke about this strange phenomenon, and as we entered the cottage (we had not been looking at the sky for approximately 5 minutes) one of the witnesses spotted another object reflecting a circular red light exactly like the first one, that followed the exact same trajectory at the same pace.   Now we all wondered if it had been a second one or a third.  However, this was disproved because soon after seeing this second UFO, a third with the exact same characteristics, following the same trajectory at the same speed passed over us again.  Now if this third object had been lower than the others I can not say with assurance.  Many questions arise from this seeing, and we have not been able to answer them.;48.5234;-80.3081
