White, slightly bright orb seen flying at highspeed over local paper mill;2008-02-07 00:10:00;15 seconds;White, slightly bright orb seen flying at highspeed over local paper mill I was driving towards Tim Horton's to go for a late night coffee. The sky was clear with the exception of the steam coming out of the stacks of the local paper mill.  When slowing down to turn into the Tim Horton's parking lot, I took a quick glance towards the mill and saw a white orb or sphere flying above the mill. It was moving in and out of the steam coming out of the stacks. It was moving very quickly and kept making sharp turns without slowing down. When I parked my car, I watched the orb, for approximately fifteen seconds before it made another sharp ninety degree turn towards the sky and instantly dissappeared.;48.5234;-80.3081
