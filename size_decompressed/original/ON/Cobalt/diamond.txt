A friend and I were star gazing. We noticed flashing lights off in the distance, 1 foot above the western horizon red, blue and white lights flashing. It appeared to be a satelite at first. As it approached us, we began to think it was an emergency plane or helicopter. It was travelling very quickly. It flew/drifted almost directly above us, and as it did, 2 more lights became visible for 10 to 20 seconds. It had a pyramid shaped bottom. Then as it passed by, the 2 front lights faded, and 4 lights were visible again, but in a reverse pattern. The wind picked up at about the same time as it was above us, so we don't know if it made any sound. We watched as it dissapeared 1 foot above the eastern horizon. Whatever it was, it came toward us from a point above the horizon, and went away above the horizon it did not follow the curvature of the earth. It was very, very high in the sky while above us. It was visible for a total of about 5 minutes. It never stopped or slowed down. We don't know if it's related, but we also saw a bright flash in the sky, shortly after this craft went by. The flash was bright enough to dimly light the sky and ground. Neither of us has ever seen anything like this before, and we tried to think of what it could be. I've personally seen many aircrafts flying above me at night, and can tell the difference between a star and a satelite. This we can't figure out what it is. The aspect that's most puzzling is that it didn't follow the curvature of the earth. It went by the earth in a straight line.;47.3843;-79.689
