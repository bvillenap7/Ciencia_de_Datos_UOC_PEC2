3 orange lights appearing at different times, all doing the exact same thing near Grand Bend, Canada;2011-07-16 23:00:00;20 min;3 orange lights appearing at different times, all doing the exact same thing near Grand Bend, Canada I and some friends were having a fire on the beach just south of Grand Bend, ON, around 11pm.  All of us have many times hoped to see a UFO. At around 11pm, we saw an orange light arise from a south-southwest direction.  The craft continued at a constant speed towards us at an altitude of between 2000 and 10 000 feet.  As no one could figure out what it was, we joked that it could be aliens and that the craft would zip away.  As soon as that was said, the craft seemed to vanish. About 5 minutes later, a second craft appeared and followed the exact course as the previous, moved at the same speed, and vanished at the same time. Another 5 minutes passed before the third and final craft appeared.  As this one appeared, a friend (who is an amature astronomer) quickly ran and got 2 sets of binoculars. As this craft followed the same course, and the same speed, we could see that it was a disk shaped opbject giving off a bright orange light.  At the point where the previous 2 vanished, one of us continued to follow it.  He says that it it shut off the orange lights, but had visible smaller blue lights under the body of the craft.  The craft was tracked for about 30 seconds before it was reported to have sped away.;43.3195;-81.7605
