As I stepped out on to my wooden deck this evening unaware, something resembling a Stealth aircraft had caught my attention as it was moving slowly and silently but most interestingly - very very close to the ground. Being after dusk the craft's colour was probably not dark but what I witnessed were several unmistakable dome shaped very dimly lit round  lights? large amber - brown on the underside of this craft in a definite formation. I remember doing everything physically possible to gain another second of vision. As I climbed the hand rail of my deck and held on to the house I could see it's tail end slowly passing diagonally over my house.The same appearance extreme heat gives in the air was coming from tail. I live in proximity to both a drive-in theatre and commercial airport. Strangely, this encounter(I'll call it)happened the evening before 9/11. The following days had every airport on high alert. But finally days later I spoke to a special official at close international airport who had received absolutely NO OTHER similar reports of such a siteing at that time.;43.2149345454548;-79.7069460606064
