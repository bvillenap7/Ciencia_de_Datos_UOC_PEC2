Yellowish orbs over Lake Ontario, often in triangular formation;1998-04-01 21:00:00;60 minutes;Yellowish orbs over Lake Ontario, often in triangular formation I have read many reports here describing three yellowish lights in the sky about Lake Ontario.  Many times they are seen in a triangular formation and sometimes as one object. I have seen these lights on two occasions, and from the vantage point of Niagara-on-the-Lake.  From the rocks at the end of the main street they are evident after sunset, and usually appear in the direction of Missisauga.  One, two or three orbs may be seen, often taking the form of a triangle (one object higher than two others).  They hang in the atmosphere, going nowhere but occasionally growing dim or blinking out.  They have been videotaped and computer-analyzed by members of a Buffalo MUFON group, and are solid objects.  There is a website (Orbwatch) devoted to them.  They are well worth investigation.  They are NOT airplanes, unless airplanes hover over lakes and emit non-blinking, yellowish light! The objects may be seen at any time of year but are more obvious in spring, summer and fall.  The date of my observation is approximate.  I am certain that many who have posted here are seeing the same objects, and that they have been around for some time. The date of observation posted is approximate. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.9315642857143;-79.0833071428571
