Bright, yellow-orange fireball;2013-08-06 22:40:00;45 seconds;Bright, yellow-orange fireball I was watching the stars behind my home while having a conversation on my mobile phone. In the northwest sky, I saw a yellow-orange fireball (bright, spherical) traveling northwards. It was silent, and brighter than a planet.  (I have some amateur astronomy experience and am familiar with the luminosity of stars and planets).  While it moved in a single direction, its speed was inconsistent and at one point it seemed to either slow down or turn away from me.  I watched it continuously, having enough time to describe it to the person on the phone.  I got the sense that it was not in the upper atmosphere but at the level where airplanes fly.  Finally, it disappeared behind some trees.;44.4102;-76.5999
