It was like a ufo on stealth mode.  It was too slow to be a shooting star (no plasma, fuel trail of any sort)  and too fast to be of ANY sort of flying vehicle that I've ever seen or heard of..  my spouse claims not to have seen it.  Shortly after I SWEAR I heard our door open and a cough (we have young children in bed at this time), so my spouse runs towards our backdoor with his cell light on.  There was nothing there.. I felt a very eerie feeling so we had went back in the house.;42.9621;-81.6212
