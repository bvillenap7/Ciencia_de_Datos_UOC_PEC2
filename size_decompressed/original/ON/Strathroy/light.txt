Chain of white lights following each other upwards.  ((Starlink satellites?));2019-12-22 20:00:00;15 minutes;Chain of white lights following each other upwards. On Dec. 22, 2019 around 8:00 pm to 8:30 pm my son called me from Thedford,   Ontario, Canada  and told me to look in the west sky as there were 3 or 4 lights following each other in a perfect line moving upwards into the sky evenly spaced and once one would reach so far up it would disappear and one would appear at the bottom of the chain.  We were in Strathroy, Ontario, Canada roughly about 25 minutes away and we could also see this chain of lights.  It lasted for about 15 â€“ 20 minutes.  Then came what seemed to be planes, 4 of them with white flashing lights but one bright red light that did not flash.   They were flying in sets of 2 going in opposite directions.  Both of us could also see those.;42.9621;-81.6212
