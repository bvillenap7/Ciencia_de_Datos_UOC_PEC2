Multiple orange circles Carleton Place ON December 25.;2012-12-25 20:30:00;10 seconds;Multiple orange circles Carleton Place ON December 25 There were at least five in a low part of the southen sky that has no other kind of lights there.  It looked to be far away but not very far but how can you tell for sure.  They appeared in a small area of the sky, the orientation was horizontal but not a straight line.  They moved about randomly and then the four lighter circles formed into a square (right angles and equidistant) and held that pose for several seconds before moving away.  No guess on speed.  The fifth circle, the brightest, stayed for several seconds more before moving away in the same direction. When we got home a facebook friend had posted a question about anyone else witnessing the orange circles that we saw.  I googled orange orbs Carleton Place and found a youtube posting (November).   What was incredible was the reaction on the video of the viewers was exactly that of a witness who came out in response to my calls.  I know it was not an airplane or Japanese lanterns or helicopters.  I don't what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
