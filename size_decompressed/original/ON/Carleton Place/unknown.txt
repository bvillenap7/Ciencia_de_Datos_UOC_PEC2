Bright orange object hovering East between Carleton Place & Ottawa, Ontario;2014-12-07 16:20:00;3:00;Bright orange object hovering East between Carleton Place & Ottawa, Ontario Around 16:20 in the afternoon, I was sitting in the passenger seat of my Mom's car, driving back home on McNeely Ave. after shopping.  Looking out towards the East (Towards Ottawa), I noticed a bright orange light. At first I didn't think much of it, because a plane was also flying very close by this light as well.  As we continued our drive along the highway, I kept watching this object, and soon relized it wasn't moving. It stayed perfectly still in that same location. After a couple minutes had passed, it suddenly changed colour to an extremely bright white light, which seemed to grow even more intense as the seconds past.  Then, as if it had never even been there, it was gone.  Didn't move in any direction, just vanished.  It's hard to say exactly how far out towards the East it was, but my best guess would be over the country farm areas between Carleton Place & Ottawa.  So perhaps roughly 10 minutes or so outside of town. It should also be noted, that roughly this far outside of town, in the South-East direction, is a military base that no one is suppose to know about, but everyone does.  Could it have been something from there?  Possibly.  Do I think that's what it was?  Absolutely not. Over the years, I have seen many bright objects such as this, over roughly the same area. But it has always been late at night, on my way home from Ottawa.  And they almost always, disappear as if they weren't there.;45.1380630434783;-76.1733565217391
