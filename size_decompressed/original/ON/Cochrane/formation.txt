Wwe noticed lights coming from the West travelling SE.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-18 21:00:00;5 minutes;My sister and I were at the edge of town taking a picture of the Town of Cochrane sign when we noticed lights coming from the West travelling South-East.  Looked like stars moving quickly across the sky.  There was about 30-40 of them in a row all spaced relatively even apart.  If these were satellite we have never seen so many in a row all travelling together. Very weird. A few moments later we then saw maybe 5 travelling in the opposite direction heading west.  Again, all in a row somewhat even spaced. Very strange.;49.0634;-81.0202
