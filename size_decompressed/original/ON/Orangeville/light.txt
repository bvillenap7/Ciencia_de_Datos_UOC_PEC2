Noticed light north west of Orangeville Onario Canada five nights in a row.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably Venus.  PD));2010-06-17 22:30:00;one hour;Noticed light north west of Orangeville Onario Canada five nights in a row to whom it may concern   For the past five nights I've notice a strange bright light north west of Orangeville Ontario Canada. I first noticed the light on Monday June 14 2010 at 10pm ,then again the very next night in the same location. On Thursday (June 16 2010)  night 10:30pm I seen the light once again but this time it was a little different. I was watching the light slowly move from side to side the drop below the tree line. the light then went to the right and stopped. just before I went inside for the night I seen the light drop what looked like a bright white flair. On June 18 2010 I went outside to see if the light would be there again and it was. This time I had a small flashlight with me,I would blink the light on and off to see if i would get any reaction. The reaction i received wasn't what i expected, the light slowly started to go north until it was out of sight.  Each night that I've seen the light it would stay around for about an hour,I'm sure I'll see it again tonight. If you have heard or seen this light please let me. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably Venus.

Brite light in night sky not from this planet .  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??  PD));2013-11-13 18:00:00;49 minutes;Brite light in night sky not from this planet . This is the second time seeing it in weeks .  A round ball of light .  Like a very very bright star.  The brightest star you ever seen .  But it's not a star .  It's not a plane , helicopter , weather ballon , tea lantern, flare, fire works  etc. ect.  You get the point.   It's something very different.  Not seen before and hard to describe.  It's hard to judge size , speed and distance from ground.  Seems to moving at a constant speed and direction.  The light might be flickering because of the atmosphere??  Or the object is emitting different intensitys of light ?? Planes are flying around it!!  Small planes up to five at a time .  I was following it in my car with two other people never getting any closer to it .  It was getting farther and farther away .   Chased for about 15 km never catching up doing about 90 km/ hour .  Had to stop ran out of road .  Just watch with binoculars for another 10 mins.  It did not seem to move.  Then it was like someone flipped  ! a switch,  the light was gone ??  Or it stopped emitting light   Either way not visible with the binoculars ..  National Deffence not interested called and emailed. ????  Let me tell you.  If it gets close enough to my house I will shoot it down !!!!!  It's not from this planet.  There is no reason for it to be out there .  And with the total lack of care from National  Deffence .  I will take care of it what ever it might be. !!! ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus??  PD));43.9695807692308;-80.024032051282
Bright object emitting a spot light/ dissappeared as if someone flipped a switch/ spot light facing West turned 90 degrees to the North;2014-11-23 21:15:00;5 minutes;Bright object emmiting a spot light/ dissappeared as if someone flipped a switch/ spot light facing West turned 90 degrees to the North I was driving northeast on highway 89, about 5 kms outside Mount Forest, and I noticed a white light in the sky Eastnortheast of me.  I just assumed it was an airplane at first.  Then it started shinning what looked like a spot light from the west side of the object.   At first I thought it was an airplane`s landing lights.  Then I realized the spot light was parallel to the ground not on a downward angle like all aircraft landing lights I have ever seen.  This is when I started to get curious to what I was looking at.  From my perspective the object didn't appear to be moving but I was moving at about 90km/h that may have skewed my perspective.  It remained like this for about two minutes then the spot light quickly and smoothly turned about 90 degrees left from my perspective and was facing North.  About 5 seconds later the bright object and the spot light it was emitting were just gone.  As if someone flipped a switch. I was admittedly startled at this point.  Then my GPS unit began to act up trying to re-route me North adding a long detour to my trip I tried to reset it a couple of times and ended up shutting it off.  I knew where I was going and I knew the routeam I just had it on to track my arival time.;43.9695807692308;-80.024032051282
