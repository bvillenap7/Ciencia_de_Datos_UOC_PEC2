One object followed me home Driving into Orangeville, Ontario, going south on 2nd line  at approximately 23:00 hours my girlfriend and I saw a bright light (like a bright star) southeast of town. It seemed to be hovering over the water tower in center of town. We stopped and watched for about 5 minutes when 6 smaller objects appeared to come out of the bright light and fly in different directions.  Each of the six objects had a blue & red light on them.  They each flew in erractic up down sideways movements.  At this point we got scared and turned around to drive home. My girlfriend saw one that appeared to be following our car and we immedietly went into the house. I went back outside and the object slowly moved over my parents home. Total time I observed the objects was about minutes.;43.9695807692308;-80.024032051282
