The odd glowing object would zip through the sky near the 3 crafts and there were a number of dimly lit glowing objects around the 3 stationary craft. every hour a black triangle would fly by pretty close to the ground until it took a stationare position in the sky. My dad and i were outside driving and we saw 3 bright lights in the sky just zipping all over. We stopped and got out and the objects just stopped and hovered. Then there were at least 3 dimly lit sperical crafts flying and hovering all over each one of the crafts. Every so often 1 or 2 other craft would come out of no where and fly right up to the stationary craft.  Then they would fly off and up into the sky till you couldnt see them anymore. About once an hour a huge black triangle with lights on it would fly pretty close to the ground just like it was patroling and up through the atmosphere.  Then another black triangle took up a hovering formation with the other craft.  We got bored looking at these things just sit there for about a half hour so we got back in the truck and drove home. I am 16 and my dad is 48.  My dad had a couple minor strokes prior to this and i have had constant nosebleeds as well as hearing voices in my head that were not mine on one occasion.;43.9695807692308;-80.024032051282
