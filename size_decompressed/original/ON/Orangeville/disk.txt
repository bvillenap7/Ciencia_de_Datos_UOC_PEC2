Strange, moving bright light, spotted in sky north of Orangeville, Ontario;2020-08-29 18:15:00;30 seconds;Strange, moving bright light, spotted in sky north of Orangeville, Ontario My wife and I were driving North on Highway 10, just north of Orangeville, Ontario, when I happened to see something very bright in the sky above the countryside that caught my eye. It was around 18:15, daylight, with partial low-level cloud cover.  The singular object appeared to be bright white, standing out clearly against the sky.  It wasn't completely round, more like a rounded disc shape (the brightness halo was the biggest feature).  It definitely did not look nor behave like an airplane - no wings, no elongated body, no contrail etc. It was around the same altitude as the clouds, roughly 5-10km away. I immediately asked my wife if she could see it too, and she confirmed that she could.  It was moving in a slow, smooth, almost cruising manner, in a Northwest direction.  After about 30s it disappeared behind a cloud.;43.9695807692308;-80.024032051282
