Fast moving orange orbs spotted again.;2015-06-15 21:30:00;2-3 minutes;Fast moving orange orbs spotted again. Low white clouds, that were about 200ft from the ground.  Then these three orange orbs emerged from the clouds and flew in circles.  They seem to fly in the same area criss-crossing each other's path.   They kept flying in and out of the clouds, and then they went back into the clouds.  They were low and fast moving clouds.   Seems as though they were using it for camouflage.;45.9651;-81.9351
