Glowing orange/red sphere over Manitoulin island.;2015-07-04 22:45:00;15 seconds;Glowing orange/red sphere over Manitoulin island. Looked up at night sky and noticed a glowing orange/red spherical object maybe 50 feet above me. It was moving east and then took a turn north towards the water.  I was outside of the shaftsburry inn.  Pretty creepy thing to spot so close just above you.  My heart rate climbed quite a bit.;45.9651;-81.9351
