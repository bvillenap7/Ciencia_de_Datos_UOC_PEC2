3 lights in triangle formation tracking south  over Kemptville.;2015-12-24 18:00:00;20 seconds;3 lights in triangle formation tracking south  over Kemptville 3 lights in a triangle formation. Each light was the same intensity and brighter than any stars.  There was no flickering or flashing.  I know enough about astronomy to quickly rule out planets, or a constellation.    As i stopped walking, i could see the 3 lights moving in unison heading south at a steady pace.  By the time, i could get my phone out and turn on the camera, i looked up and it, 3 lights was no longer there.   The wind was blowing heavy to the east.    I can't rule out Chinese lanterns but the wind was blowing in the wrong direction.;44.9692;-75.6726
