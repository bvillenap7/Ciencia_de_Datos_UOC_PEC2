3 red orb-like objects flying low and slow in formation;2013-07-13 21:50:00;5 minutes;3 red orb-like objects flying low and slow in formation Saturday 13th July 2113 Kemptville, ON Canada (25 miles South of Ottawa)   Was watching TV at 9:50 p.m. when neighbor called (he was out walking his dog), tells me to come outside immediately and look north he says there are three red balls of light in the sky.  My wife and I run out and sure enough I see two of whatever they are, moving from east to west.  Difficult to say the distance but they seem fairly close (I estimate a couple of kilometers or less at about 1500 feet). The objects were a pretty steady orangish red and seemed to move at a constant speed about the same as a very small airplane. My neighbor said he watched them for a good three minutes before I came outside, all followed the same route, east to west until they were right in front of us and turned north towards Ottawa. The objects never changed altitude nor did their speed change and no sound at all.  About a minute after heading north they just dimmed and faded out. I managed to run and grab a camera and got 3 shots of one of them before it faded out, of which only one picture shows the thing as I saw it, the others show narrow trails of light in a squiggly pattern. It was a very clear night with no wind at all, temperature was about 27 Celsius (about 80 degrees F.)  This experience was at the same time fascinating, chilling and very bizarre.;44.9692;-75.6726
