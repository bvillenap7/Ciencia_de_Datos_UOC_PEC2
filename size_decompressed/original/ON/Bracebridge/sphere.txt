Large silver ball observes Muskoka cottagers, then retreats much faster than anything of this world possibly could;1978-08-14 02:00:00;5 minutes;Large silver ball observes Muskoka cottagers, then retreats much faster than anything of this world possibly could I know that extraterrestrial life exists, because of what I saw back in the summer of 1978 ~   My girlfriend April and I were sitting on the dock of my cottage, on Skeleton Lake, 14 miles north of Bracebridge, Ontario, Canada (part of the Muskoka Lakes area).  We were listening to my transistor radio it was after midnight and the guys were inside the cottage.  We had consumed no alcohol or drugs and were just enjoying the cool, rather misty night, and each other's company.  We worked together at an advertising agency during the week, at Yonge Street & Eglinton Avenue East in Toronto. All of a sudden, we heard a very faint whirring sound behind us overhead, and both looked up above the cottage roof where it originated from, at the same time.  What we saw there was this...a large, silver object which appeared perfectly round, beaming some kind of light on us.   Our jaws dropped, and we simply sat there frozen, stunned and terrified for a few seconds, which was how long it took me to receive a silent communication which was,you're afraid.  Then, the object took off upward, resembling what I could very loosely compare to the Roadrunner in the old cartoons when he was under chase, said beep beep, and ended up way beyond the mountains on the horizon in a matter of seconds.   Only now it was who-knows-how-many-miles directly above our heads (this was probably what is known as a hyperspace move) it then did a slow rectangular trajectory, then disappeared behind a cloud.  Perhaps it joined with something else, because what we witnessed next, through the clouds w! as a huge mass of light moving up, up and away into the northeastern sky. I lay awake that night, half-expecting little green men to come knocking at the door.  Our husbands were kind of in disbelief at our shared experience, I guess you can't blame them, but we saw what we saw, and looking back, I now consider myself extremely lucky and perhaps even chosen to have had them come and observe my friend and I that night ... it was definitely the highlight of my life. I would love to hear from others who have had sightings!   Cheers,  M ~ ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));45.0350277777778;-79.3169722222222
I 8- 9 bright orbs moving across the night sky each orb/bright light.

The lights moved from WSW to ENE. They stopped after the ninth light traversed the sky.;45.0350277777778;-79.3169722222222
