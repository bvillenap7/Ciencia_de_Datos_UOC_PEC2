August 25, 2008 Sighting over Guelph Ontario;2008-08-25 10:45:00;45 sec;August 25,2008 Sighting over Guelph Ontario I wasnt able to hit record in time but had zoomed in with my camera first.Story of my life.With the naked eye it seemed twice as bright as the north star itself.I had zoomed to 800 times magnification and what a spectacular sight.A sphere with a bright light around the oustide and what looked like dimples on a golph ball.At first i thought maybe a planet close to us at the time, but the dimples were so uniform that it did not resemble scattered craters.Then i noticed a Shadow along one quarter of the top portion of the sphere.This took 15 to 20 seconds.Then i tryed to find the record button on my new camera....dammed if when i looked up and it was gone.This has made my first sighting ever, an incredible event.Wish i had the shots for everyone.It was so bright someone else must have seen it.Hope someone at least got the shot.;43.5481803508772;-80.2506915789473
