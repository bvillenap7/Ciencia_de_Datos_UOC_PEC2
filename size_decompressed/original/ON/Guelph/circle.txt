My wife spotted an object moving across the sky and pointed it out to me.;2005-06-29 23:04:00;1.5 minutes;My wife spotted an object moving across the sky and pointed it out to me. We watched a pale orangey-yellow circle travel from east to west across the centre of the sky. The sky was completely cloud free. The object moved at an even pace. Just when I thought it was travelling in a straight line at constant velocity, it slowed down a bit and veered a little bit to the left. It appeared to gain altitude as it passed into the west, as it got noticeably smaller and seemed to accelerate away. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Was a circular object drifting through the sky smoothly. Then suddenly stopped and hovered. After 10 minutes disappeared. There were flashing colors of light. to many to name.Myself and the witnesses went outside to see if it was a trick. but there was no one around.I strongly think it is a U.F.O, and not a plane. There was also a hazy trail behind it, and a sound not describable. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));43.5481803508772;-80.2506915789473
Witnessed 9 bright orange objects, flying in exact formation with 3 flying v formation at front of each group of 3.;2011-08-06 21:45:00;15 minutes;Witnessed 9 bright orange objects, flying in exact formation with 3 flying v formation at front of each group of 3. They were bright orange, 3 in front flew in v formation, with 3 following in a straight line, this happened in 3 seperate groups, no noise at all,  They flew in from south east direction.They were round in shape, bright orange with no lights.  It was a clear night, no stars or planes in the sky at that time. It was about 9:45pm. When I was taking pics they started to separate from formation and flew around each other then disappeared higher into the nite sky, could not see them after that. I attempted to take video with my camera, but was so excited and had never used the video on camera before, the video only shows one as I treid to track them with camera, seems as tho when my camera started to flash they started to move around and it was hard to track them at that point. I saw about 9 of these bright orange flying objects,in about a 15 min period of time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

A  large, round, bright red/orange object drifted across the sky over Guelph, Canada, at 11:00 p.m. on August 9, 2013.;2013-08-09 23:00:00;2 minutes;A  large, round, bright red/orange object drifted across the sky over Guelph, Canada, at 11:00 p.m. on August 9, 2013. A very large, perfectly round, very bright red/orange object drifted slowly across the Guelph sky at 11:00 p.m. on August 9th, 2013.  It had NO flashing lights, travelled from west to east, was relatively low in the sky (at about a 45 degree angle from the ground), and the red/orange colour was so vivid that the 5 individuals who witnessed it at first wondered if it was a small plane on fire.   It was quickly established of course that this was not the case, given that the object was obviously not falling, but rather, maintaining a steady course across the sky.  From the time we noticed the object, it took approximately 2 minutes for it to travel out of our sight towards the east.   The 5 witnesses were puzzled by this sighting, and found the experience quite unsettling.  Although our hope is that the object was a large, low-flying satellite, we have continued to feel unsettled today in light of the fact that none of us have ever given any credence to reports of UFO sightings in the past.   We have checked our local paper to ascertain if others in Guelph witnessed the object, but no mention of the incident has been noted thus far.   We remain puzzled and disquieted, and hope to discover a logical explanation to calm our minds regarding what we saw last night.   The witnesses consist of a 54 year old teacher, a 52 year old Occupational Therapist, a 54 year old Information Technology manager at a large university, a 54 year old graphic designer, and a 19 year old university student (the son of one of the two couples present).;43.5481803508772;-80.2506915789473
