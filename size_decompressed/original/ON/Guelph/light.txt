Bright light moving from SSW to NNE that pulsed slowly from cool blue to brilliant white.;2000-07-15 03:15:00;20-30sec;Bright light moving from SSW to NNE that pulsed slowly from cool blue to brilliant white. At approximatly 3:15am on the morning of july 15/00 I was walking on a side street of my home town with some friends. We were returning from getting some food when we stopped to talk to some people at a house party. As we were talking a light caught my attention. I looked up to the South/South West where I saw what appeared to be a light that grew and was glowing a brilliant white. As I continued to watch the light, it travelled in a North/North East direction and began to fade to a cool star blue colour. I continued to watch for the light but it became so faint that I could no longer see it. The speed of the light was relativly quick, I could judge the speed because I could see it passing in front of the stars. I am an airline maintenance technician at Pearson Airport in Toronto. I am used to seeing a/c in the sky. At first I thought it may have been an a/c on approach to Pearson since I was only 100km from the airport. However as the light dimmed I looked for evidence of strobe lights, position lights or navigation lights and there were none present. Also the altitude of the object was very high, not characteristic of an a/c on approach to Pearson. In fact the size of the light and the colour after the brightness dimmed looked just like a star. I would have easily have mistaken it for a star. And finally as an employee of Pearson Airport in Toronto, ON. I know for a fact that the airport has a curfew on aircraft traffic between the times of 12:30am to 06:30am, therefore it is unlikly than an a/c would be approaching Pearson with a landing light on. A/C do not fly with these bright lights on unless they are landing. I am going to try and get in touch with some friends at Air Traffic Control to see if their was traffic in the area at this time. If I find anything else out I will post the information as soon as I receive it.;43.5481803508772;-80.2506915789473
Ball of light over Guelph Lake disappears instantly.;2011-03-06 18:20:00;One minute;Ball of light over Guelph Lake disappears instantly. On my way home at dusk, a ball of light was over Guelph Lake.   At first I thought it was a plane, and it was still too light out to be a star.   As I watched it, it literally just disappeared.;43.5481803508772;-80.2506915789473
