I was sitting at my computer looking out my window at the University of Guelph looking West. I watched as a craft flew over the residence bound West South West. The craft made no sound and proceded on a straight course at roughly 200 knots. The craft was triangular shaped with a bright circular light at each corner. No other lights were visible and the craft itself was dark (the triangular shape is a guess based on the position of the lights). Another interesting point is that the aircraft pattern to land at YYZ (Pearson International Airport) is ENE so this aircraft was headed against the commercial air traffic (I am an amatuer pilot).;43.5481803508772;-80.2506915789473
V-Shaped object(s) sighted above Guelph Ontario April 24 2003;2003-04-24 21:50:00;35 seconds;V-Shaped object(s) sighted above Guelph Ontario April 24 2003 Not so much a triangle but a series of dim lights in a V-shaped formation that seemed to change shape before we lost sight of it.  We believe it was 7 lights in total (3 on each side and one in the lead).  It flew silently above us at about 4000 feet (estimated one witness who is a former F-18 pilot) doing a rather high speed heading north.  I would like to know if anyone else in Guelph or anywhere else saw the same thing tonight.  Please Email me;43.5481803508772;-80.2506915789473

We walked out the doors at at the same time looked at each other and said oh my god did you see that!  We saw a triagle shaped flying object with lights at every point, I saw them as being pinkish red and my friend saw the lights as being white. I could actually see the shape of this object in the sky as triangular but the points were rounded not sharp.  The object was in the west sky heading east, it was flying at very low altitude with no sound and fast!  Really weird but kinda cool what it was can only be described as a unidetified flying object!;43.5481803508772;-80.2506915789473
