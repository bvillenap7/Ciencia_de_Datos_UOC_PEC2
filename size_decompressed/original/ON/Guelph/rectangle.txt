Craft with five lights moving quickly and silently;2011-08-13 21:30:00;3 seconds;Craft with five lights moving quickly and silently I was in the backyard of a neighbourâ€™s house seated just out side of a tent pavilion, close to the house. I looked up to the sky and saw a set of 5 yellow-white lights that seemed part of a larger, possibly rectangular craft.  It passed by quickly and completely silently, disappearing over the roof of the house. I saw it for only 3 seconds or so, the time for it to pass over the pavilion and then disappear over the house.  I am a computer programmer/analyst in my mid-forties.;43.5481803508772;-80.2506915789473
