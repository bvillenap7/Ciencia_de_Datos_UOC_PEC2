Oval shaped object w/ 3 white lights & Red beam on belly.  Witnessed by 2.  Clear night.  Little wind.;2020-08-19 22:30:00;~3 minutes;Oval shaped object w/ 3 white lights&Red beam on belly. Witnessed by 2. Clear night. Little wind. At approximately 2230Hrs EST Myself and my partner witnessed what apeared to be an oval Shaped object in the sky that hung just above the tree line. The object made no noise and seemed to hover over the area. It swayed back and fourth.  It levelled out and began to gain altitude in an upwards direction before stopping in place. After about one minutes of hovering, it began to lower and a bright red light was emitted for the lower section. The object in question seemed to be the shape of a narrow oval.  It had three sets of very bright white lights across and a very bright red light on the belly that cast a light into the woods. The object made no noise. The skies were clear and a slight wind was present.  Unfortunately I didnâ€™t have my phone on me at the time. I will keep and eye out for this or any similar objects over the course of the next few weeks and have a high resolution camera with me.;43.5481803508772;-80.2506915789473
