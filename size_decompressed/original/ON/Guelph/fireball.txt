It was a red ball type of  light,  approximately 3 times flashed off.  Travelling at a very high speed approximately 6 fist lenghts off horizon, quite high.  It did a triangle flight pattern and proceeded to the north west  of sky area, did three sort of circular small patterns and went into atmoshpere,    It was a clear sky, was admiring stars for about 10 minutes prior.  Today is Feb 24, 1998, and I can still remember it clearly.  I was quite taken aback!!!  did some calling around to planetarium and observatories and they did not take me seriously, some said could be ball lighning.   What surpised me most was how quickly it would change direction.  Zooming from one end and quickly shifting flight direction.  I screamed for my friends to come out of the house but time did not permitt.  Their is a small single engine plane  airport in area somewhere but I could not understand what flight pattern I was seeing especially as it flew up into atmosphere. It did not disappear into distance (i.e. east or west) but in altitude.  Seem to originally come overhead of Kitchner to south east over to Cambridge then to Waterloo direction back to cambridge over toward Kitchner direction   then in Kitchener area its 3 spins  small circles like spirals and then shoots strainght out into atmoshpere (space)..  I mention the towns to give you indication of how I observed it in  its flight pattern;43.5481803508772;-80.2506915789473
large fireball  very low passes over many people on a hot evening in downtown guelph too fast for baloon.;2009-08-15 23:00:00;2-3 min.;Large fireball very low passes over many people on a hot evening in downtown guelph too fast for balloon. Passing from west to east at about (my guess), 1000 feet directly over city of Guelph. This at first seemed like perhaps a balloon but passed over too fast and fire was like a red jet blast but not focused nor small and directed like balloon gas fire. This was like a very large firey chaos moving east with no discernable sound or running lights or form.;43.5481803508772;-80.2506915789473
