Fuzzy orange sphere in night sky moving quickly south to north no nav lights visible;2013-10-12 20:28:00;2 minutes;Fuzzy orange sphere in night sky moving quickly south to north no nav lights visible Reporting a UFO   Last evening approximately 2028 hr. EST I was watching tv with my wife when I happened to glace out side.  I saw what appeared to be an object orange in color flying past the window.  I then proceeded to get my camera and went out to the back yard where I picked it up again in the night sky.  I attempted to photograph this object at first I thought I had failed but on closer inspection I believe I was successful.  The object was round in nature orange in color and moving from south to north at what seemed to be a good speed.  However, there is no way to tell if the object was large and far away or close and smaller.  As far as I can tell it had a somewhat fuzzy appearance, also with regards to the photo I think there may be two of them in it, one further away and higher in the sky. I did report this to NAV Canada and talked to a Corporal ((name deleted)).  He took my call seriously and took down the info I have just given you.  I am a newly retired paramedic and I can categorically state that I am not inventing things out of boredom nor am I looking for the limelight.   If there is any more I can help you with please feel free to contact me. With Regards:;44.2501;-79.4663
