Strange thing moving fast in the sky, dropping a white fireball?;2013-07-30 01:00:00;5 minutes;Strange thing moving fast in the sky, dropping a white fireball? 2 nights ago, while standing on our balcony to looking to the north sky, we witnessed a light way up in the sky, it was not flashing (like a plane) there was no clouds in the sky either.  I watched this thing grow very very bright as it moved from west sky to east sky, it got very bright and then dimmed as it moved across the sky, it then again got very bright and went dim, and out of sight.  With no clouds in the sky, it seemed to be as high as a satellite.  As it moved to the eastern sky, a white ball fell directly north and went dim as it went out of sight behind a small apartment building.   As I was speaking to my husband tonight about the first incident 2 days ago, we witnessed a green light fall, much like the white one 2 nights ago.  This is why I have come on here to investigate what all this could be.  It definitely was not a plane, however, I thought perhaps it was the ISS, dropping garbage.  I really have no clue what this was, but in speaking to ! a friend, they have been witnessing fireballs landing to the north as well, around 10pm for a few evenings in the past week... all of the balls her family saw were red.;44.2501;-79.4663
