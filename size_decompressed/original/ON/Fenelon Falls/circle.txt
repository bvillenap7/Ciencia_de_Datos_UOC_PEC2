Then it got really bright and flew away faster then anything I have seen before.   I have seen comets and shooting stars before and it wasnt one of those and it was no plane.   This isnt the first time I have seen something like this but now I feel like people should really know whats going on in the world and that these things do happen.;44.534;-78.7493
