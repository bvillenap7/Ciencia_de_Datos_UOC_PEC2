Double rack of lights over Georgian Bay;2013-04-14 20:30:00;4 hours;Double rack of lights over Georgian Bay April 14 2013 Just as the sun was going down my husband and I noticed some bright lights hanging stationary in the sky over Georgian Bay.  There were like 2 racks of lights, one slightly behind the other, suspended over the lake.  They would stay illuminated, then fade out to nothing, and nothing was in the sky -was still light at that time.  Too high for it to be a boat, and there was no boat anyways.   We decided to go down to the water's edge for a better look, by the time we got there, they blinked out.  Then as we were leaving, they blinked on again.   They've been doing that for 4 hours.  Sometimes it's one rack,  then a second one, fainter,  for 15 minutes, then the faint one fades out, followed by the second more brilliant one, also fades out.  It was a mostly clear sky with some ribbon clouds at the horizon, but clear overhead.  Crescent moon was bright, as was I think Venus, or some star just off to the right of the moon.   One time the lights blinked out,  then when they blinked on they were in a different spot.  They don't move, it's like they are hovering stationary.  When they are illuminated, they appear to be pulsing, not a steady light.  Seems mostly a white light, very bright.  We thought at first it was a helicopter search team or something,  but helicopters would be moving not hangin stationary for 4 hours. My husband filmed it for a few minutes before it blinked out.;44.5185;-80.0201000000001
