V-shaped object adorned with static red lights crossed sky before suddenly disappearing.;2015-08-22 21:00:00;5-6 minutes;V-shaped object adorned with static red lights crossed sky before suddenly disappearing. Initially looked like one large, elongated red light moving east to west.  Shape shifted to appear as two V-shaped spans of smaller red lights (one V inside the other about six red lights within each arm of each V).   Hard to tell distance - seemed to be within a few kilometres in that case, object would have been about the size of a DC 9.  No noise evident.   Object moving slowly, in sight for about three minutes, then appeared to turn to the north and visible for another two minutes or so.  Lights suddenly disappeared, as if extinguished.   A quick Google search indicated (if I read correctly) that commercial/recreational aircraft need to display red, white and green lights lights on this object were red only, and none were flashing lights, as required.;44.5185;-80.0201000000001
