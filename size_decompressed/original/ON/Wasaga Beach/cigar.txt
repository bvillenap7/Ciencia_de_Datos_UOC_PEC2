Flash in the sky then silver cigar shaped craft appeared.;1998-10-02 14:00:00;10 -20 seconds;Flash in the sky then silver cigar shaped craft appeared. I was riding my motorcycle northbound on the eastern side of Wasaga Beach area ,on a county road near what I think is called Woodland Beach when a flash in the sky [ which was clear] made me look up. I saw a silver cigar shaped thing with no visible windows or marking of any kind just appear, it made a very slight turn to it's right and just disappeared.I had the sense it knew I was looking at it.  I can still see it in my minds eye this amount of time later.... I heard a guy call in to Coast to Coast radio show that following December right around Christmas and describe almost the exact same thing even to the flash in the sky but can't recall now where it was he saw it  ,western states I think, maybe Utah or when he saw it....I have argued with myself since it happened to report it. I haven't  told anyone until now, it feels good to get it  off my chest...thanks.;44.5185;-80.0201000000001
