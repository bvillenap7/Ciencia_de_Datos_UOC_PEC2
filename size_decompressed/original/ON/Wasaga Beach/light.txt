Walking through a parking lot, I looked up and noticed a red light moving all over the place in one spot but ascending and at first I thought it was a plane but it kept moving up and down and left to right very sporadically, very scattered.  It was not moving straight forward and smooth like a plane nor was the light flashing like a plane would were you would usually see white light then red followed right after.  It then just disappeared and there was no more red light at all.  The red light just faded slowly and I couldn't see the movement anymore.
