energy  glows seen over town following aircraft;2003-04-15 01:00:00;20 seconds;energy  glows seen over town following aircraft During the start of the second war on Iraq I quite often would stay up late watching I suppose military craft crossing lake huron since their is an airforce base in Michigan I understand across the lake from Goderich.  I know that commercial craft do not fly during one and two in the morning in the direction they were flying at any other time. My sighting took place while I was standing in my driveway about 1:30 am.  Noticing a very high flying jet flying on a direction I would guess at w/nw.  As I watched the jet fade away across the lake I witnessed ,on the exact same heading and on the same line two glows one above the other about 1/2 inch in size from arms length.  They did not have a destinctive outline other than an oval shape and they did seem to me to be an energy.  At the time it seemed odd that they would be following on the exact heading as the jet that I was watching.  I should say that they were travelling at a higher speed than the jets. Please return an e-mail if this incounter interests you.  By the way I had been listening to a show on ufo's on shortwave which I believe is aired every second tuesday.
