The two objects in formation left no trail , sound or other noticables.;2001-07-27 00:20:00;7 seconds;The two objects in formation left no trail , sound or other noticables. While observing the skies for shooting stars of which I counted 4 in approximately 8-10 minutes at about 20 minutes past midnight on july27/01 appearing overhead on about a 280 degree heading (2)glows one on the right slighty ahead,at arms length 3\4 inch apart with glow 1\4 inch diameter travelling very fast and silent.Living nearby an airport I can guess that if a cessna flew overhead at about 1000 ft that the flying lights on the wingtips would be nearly the identical distance of the glows separation.The objects were not a light as we know but energy. The objects had no noticable trail,sound as mentioned but I noticed shortly after an aircraft very high with nightlights, heading on the identical heading which is strange because airtraffic usually heads on an east/west path especially at night.
