It didn't move very fast, but made no sound that we could hear, and the entire object was a bright orange light.  So bright, it reflected off the lake.  It continued straight North, then turned a bit westward, directly away from us, until it faded from view.  Total time around 4 minutes.;43.7501;-81.7165
