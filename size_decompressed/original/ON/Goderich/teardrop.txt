2 Yellow-Orange Tear drop shaped orbs;2012-08-05 22:00:00;15 seconds;2 Yellow-Orange Tear drop shaped orbs I searched this site to see if anyone reported a UFO sighting near Goderich on August 5th, 2012. I came across the post from someone in London identifying very much what we saw. Our sighting took place August 5th, 2012 near Goderich (specifically about 20 minutes drive north of Goderich).  We were at a cottage and at about roughly 10 p.m. the four of us, sitting in the backyard, saw 2 floating orange-yellowish tear drop shape globes. To me they looked light floating light bulbs shapes. The colours seemed somewhat translucent and they didnâ€™t appear to be  traveling on any specific trajectory.   They seemed to bob and weave as they passed over us. There was no sound coming nor trail of emissions emanating from them. The whole sighting was about 10-15 seconds.  We were all very clear that there seemed no logical scientific explanation of what those lights might be and none of us had never seen anything like it before. It was quite strange and beautiful.;43.7501;-81.7165
