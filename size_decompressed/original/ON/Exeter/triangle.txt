The most awesome sight ever!;2012-07-02 23:30:00;1h 30;The most awesome sight ever! At approximately 2330h EST, I was sitting outside on the deck with my wife and saw an orange-red ball heading south from over top of our apartment building.  I ran inside to grab my binoculars and by the time I got back outside, it was gone. Then at approximately 0030h EST, my wife, my neighbor and I witnessed another orange-red object cut across the sky from east to west.  This was the exact same colour as the first, both travelling at a moderate speed, looking as if it was going up and fading out. At 0100h EST as I was walking my dog to the field adjacent (to the west) to our building I looked to the north and noticed another ball coming up from the horizon heading south over top of where I was standing with my dog.  It was flying extremely low, approximately 10 meters from the ground.  As it cruised over me, it made no sound.  There was no heat emitted, it was clearly a triangular shape, illuminated by orange-red lights.  The entire object was glowing.  It appeared to be big enough to hold just one person. As it flew over me I was flashing my flashlight at it, with no communicative response, however, it did slow down My dog was frozen in his spot and did not look away, as was I.  Once it was approximately 4 meters past us, it began to ascend in a diagonal motion towards the south.  It went through the clouds and I lost sight of it.  The whole experience lasted no more than 15 minutes.;43.353;-81.4869000000001
