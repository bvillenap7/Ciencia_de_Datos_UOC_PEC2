Fire in the sky!!;2012-07-02 00:30:00;2 minutes;Fire in the sky!! At approximately 23:30h EST, I was sitting on our deck with my husband when a very bright, red/orange light (comparable to a fire ball) was heading in a southerly direction.  It was moving at a slow to moderate speed and within a minute or so disappeared, almost parallel to the position of the moon.  It did not appear to burn out, but to travel further into the distance. Then at 00:30h EST as we sat out with a neighbor, we saw a second light, almost identical, just not as bright was travelling westward at roughly the same speed as the first one.  This light appeared to be below the clouds, weaving around them, as if avoiding them.  Then, after a brief time, no more than two minutes, the light moved behind the clouds and disappeared. Both of these lights did not appear to have a steady beam, but fluttered slightly.;43.353;-81.4869000000001
