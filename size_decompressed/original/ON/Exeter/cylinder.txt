We couldn't hear a noise and there were no lights and it just seemed to be hanging there and then it just vanished.  It was some distance away (several miles) but both my husband and I seen it and a friend that was with us.  The sky was clear blue with no clouds.  If it was an airplane it vanished right before our eyes.;43.353;-81.4869000000001
