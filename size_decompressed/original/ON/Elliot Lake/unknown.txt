Event occurred on a camping trip on Elliot lake perhaps a kilometre out of town.  At 23:30 we began to hear the electrical buzzing sononamous (sic.  synonymous) with high voltage transformer.  We both found it quite out of the ordinary, but dismissed it.   I looked up at the stars and at first glance appeared to be a satellite flying past three points of light which looked like stars.  The three apparent stars blinked out one after the other from left to right and the apparent satilite was left behind.  The realization set in that the three 'stars' which blinked out were the ones in motion and what was thought to be a satellite remained, and was actually a star itself.   About a minute later the electrical transformer buzz dissipated and we were again returned to the sounds of the wilderness.  The buzzing returned about 45-60 minutes later and I kept my eyes on the sky but no odd signs were to be seen.   We then began discussing the event and I advised him to let me know if he began to have nightmares in the coming weeks.;46.3853999999999;-82.6280999999999
