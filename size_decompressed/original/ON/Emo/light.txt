Bright light, like a star, flashing red, rapid vertical and horizontal movement;2005-08-04 23:30:00;30 min +;Bright light, like a star, flashing red, rapid vertical and horizontal movement IN the northern sky, close to the horizon, looked like a few miles away.  Watched from the upstairs window, it was above the tree line sillouette.  Lots of stars in the sky very visible.  The object looked like a star, a bright star, but moved erratically, like a housefly, or mosquito, quickly darting left or right, down and up, flashing red at times, then still for a few moments, then the rapid movements again, with red flashing across it.  It seemed connected to another light,or star, not as bright, which was down and to the right, which would appear, then disappear.  There didn't seem to be a pattern to the appearance, or the movements of the dimmer light.  We watched it for over a half hour, wondered about it, but it was still there when we went to bed at midnight.;48.8766;-93.7514
