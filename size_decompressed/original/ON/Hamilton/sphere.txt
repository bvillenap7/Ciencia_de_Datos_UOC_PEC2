I thought it was strange as I was not aware they had a helicopter pad.  It also became apparent this object had no tail rotor.  By  this point my friend had crossed the street and was also pointing out the object.  It appeared to be metallic, as the sun was reflecting off of it.  It also made a high pitched like nice, and at times would shoot off at great speed.  We followed the object for a good 15 minutes or so, and at times it seemed like the object was aware of us, at disappearing then coming back into our view.  After some time following it I was moving from total curiousity to some apprehension as we seemed to be following the object into an enclosed part of the hospital.  But then it flew up rapidly and was gone.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
It was plainly round & metallic. It move from east to west against the wind at a pace that moved it out of view in ten seconds.;2003-08-27 19:30:00;10 seconds;It was plainly round & metallic. It move from east to west against the wind at a pace that moved it out of view in ten seconds. My nephew spotted it first and brought to our attention. It was plainly round & metallic. It moved from east to west against the wind at a pace that moved it out of view in ten seconds. A weather ballon comes to mind, but the altitude remained constant, and the speed could not be achieved from wind alone.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
Brilliant golden boulder-like craft;2007-06-20 19:00:00;6 seconds;Brilliant golden boulder-like craft I was sitting on my front porch feeding the birds. A group of seagulls were circling overhead which caused me to look skyward. I observed a golden spherical object traveling WSW to ENE toward Lake Ontario.The sky was cloudless and the sun had started it's descent. The object can be best described as a large boulder and was of a brilliant golden color. The sun may have enhanced the color of the object but it had a clearly defined shape, not a blurry one that would be caused by light reflection. There was no sound or vapor trail. It was traveling much faster than an aircraft or satellite but slower than a meteorite . It had a definite shape and was only observed for a matter of 5 to 6 seconds. It's speed was such that it disappeared from view in the sky well before it reached the horizon. It is impossible for me to estimate it's altitude but it appeared to be less than that of an overflying aircraft. This location is approx. 3 nautical miles from John C. Munroe International Airport and there is a fair amount of traffic at times.It was not traveling in the direction of the airport and would have been at an altitude that would have prevented it from making a landing approach either here or at Pearson International in Toronto. I am a 61 year old male, retired from a professional position and am agnostic with regards to UFO's and their origin. This the first sighting I have had in my lifetime.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
Unidentified object spotted at sea off Key West Fla.;2008-02-24 21:30:00;approx 12 seconds;Unidentified object spotted at sea off Key West Fla. I was sitting on a starboard balcony of a cruise ship, scanning the northern sky. The ship's position was in the northern gulf, west-southwest of Key West Fla. The sky was mainly clear with scattered clouds low on the horizon. Several stars were visible but one stood out as it appeared to be a sphere rather that a twinkling object. I presumed it was a planet and that was more clearly visible due to being in open waters with the absence of light. I then became more intruiged with it as I realized it was positioned between my line of sight and the scattered cloud cover. No sooner had I realized that, then the object began spinning in a pinwheel fashion, the circumference of the area growing with each revolution. It spun very fast and I can only speculate that it spun 8-12 times. It then sped off in a north-westerly direction at an amazing rate of speed. I find it difficult to characterize the sighting and the motion other than to compare it's actions with the child's game of crack the whip. The pinwheel motion almost looked like the object was gaining momentum and when it had enough, it flung itself into the northwestern sky. I followed it for approx 1-2 seconds before it disappeared. I cannot articulate properly the impact of witnessing this phenomenon. It was much more spectacular than my description provides.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
Multiple glowing orbs, flying in formation, spherical objects that would move at unusual formation patterns.;2012-01-07 22:00:00;5 minutes;Multiple glowing orbs, flying in formation, spherical objects that would move at unusual formation patterns.   These orbs were spotted over areas of southern Ontario region such as lower Dundas, Hamilton bay, Burlington, Oakville,and Mississauga.   Some would slowly start to glow until it illuminated complete causing an almost blinding flash.   Seen lowly below the horizon with six other people.  At one time they appeared in a group and almost 7-10 of these same glowing orange/yellow orbs were visible at a time.   This was a first experience for most of the witnesses.   Sights of single glowing orbs occurred over the same area about 2-3 days ago by the same witness of this occurrence. Even now as I type on my phone we are still witnessing minor occurrences with the same glowing effect. Posting a video on YouTube soon of some footage. Just search glowing orbs in Hamilton area.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
