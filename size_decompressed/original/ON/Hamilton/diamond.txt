Traditional UFO shaped object in the distance that fluctuated in size and rotated in place mimicking report from Apr 17/20;2020-05-04 22:18:00;>30 minutes;Traditional UFO shaped object in the distance that fluctuated in size and rotated in place mimicking report from Apr 17/20 LOCATION: Hamilton, Ontario FILMED: Facing West near King St W and Queen St S towards Flamborough.  Just after 10pm on May 4, my friend and I noticed a large flickering light in the distance that replicated the UFO-like object spotted on April 17 (reported prior). The difference with this one, although we didn't spend as much time analyzing, it caught our attention right away as it, again, looked like a really big, bright, shiny star with the naked eye.  I used a Sony HDR-CX455 camcorder (30 x Optical zoom, 1080p HD Video) to capture and zoom in and out on the almost-diamond-like shaped object that appeared to have lights along the exterior edges. Sometimes when I zoomed in and out, it appeared just as a large bright circle, yet other times mimic the look of the traditional UFO shape with lights. It appeared to fluctuate in size.  I have several video clips of the object that can be emailed if requested.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
