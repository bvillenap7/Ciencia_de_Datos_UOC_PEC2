Thay wern't Birds but flew in the same formation as geese. My friends and I were up late watching the stars when we saw what looked like a flock of boomerangs fly over us in a perfect V formation. As thay got further away some broke formation and jumped higher at rapid speeds. Thay had a dark Gray colour to them. No sound was herd.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275

At first I thought it was light from the type of searchlight that bars or clubs may occaisionally use, and I kept watching for it to come around again, but it did not. Maybe two minutes after this, a triangular formation of three lights came into view, travelling incredibly fast from NNW to SSE. It was probably only about six seconds from the time they came into view from over the roof of my  North-side neighbour's garage until they passed out of view behind the roof of my South-side neighbours house. I would estimate this to offer me a view of sixty to seventy percent of the sky along the flight path. I did not see any metallic type of craft, only three distinct, equally bright lights that were a dull yellow colour, and not sharp, but rather fuzzy, as if slightly out of focus.(Perhaps I should mention that I was only drinking bottled water). Each light was, I would guess, to be about the size of a dime if I were holding it at arm's length, spaced about triple that length apart, with the two trailing lights about sixty degrees off from the leading light. It passed over without making any discernible sound at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
two light in formation over the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.  PD));2009-09-08 21:17:00;2 min;two light in formation over the sky We were go to our car from house at night and my wife tell me look at the sky...I saw 2 light which were travel same speed from west to east like one object .It was like two bright points .I thing it was one object with light on each ends ( front end rear ) hard to say how long it was ...we also saw plain over those two light much higher on the sky it was easy to to find because it was blinking .but those two light didn't blinking it just past in formation same speed  approximately 100 m apart . We were surprise that we actually see UFO because I have no idea what other should beâ€¦. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.  PD));43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275

Some lights would disappear and others would appear somewhere else.  One light in particular did not seem to move for over 15 minutes, but it was hard to tell for sure.  Many lights were moving and fading in and out, but all staying relatively close.  The lights seemed far too bright to be airplanes, and some would remain still for minutes at a time. They had a bid of a reddish colour to them as well.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
A series of orange star-like orbs moving in one direction;2020-09-12 22:00:00;Unsure, few minutes;A series of orange star-like orbs moving in one direction We were sitting on the balcony enjoying the weather, there were a few clouds but no moon yet.  We both simultaneously saw a collection of orange lights about the brightness of stars (but brighter than you can normally see in this city due to light pollution) and flying in a loose group from behind the trees in the eastern sky, continued to fly upward and towards the north like a fleet.  After a minute or two they seemed to form into a straight line and we'd see more joining from behind the trees, but eventually they all blinked or faded out as they got further north.  I managed to view them up close in the binoculars but all I could see was an orb or disc-like shape, single light each, definitely not regular planes.  I later found the Phoenix lights when doing research and they were somewhat similar but a lot smaller.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
