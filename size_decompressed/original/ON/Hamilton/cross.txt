My mother, and brother were over for Sunday dinner and we were sitting on my balcony off of my kitchen when my mother said, look, what is that. I looked up and seen a clear, illuminated object in the west sky.  If was difficult to make out a defined shape of the object but it appeared wider horizontally that vertically.  The object seemed to have a strange illumination that gave a cross kind of shape.  It was sunny and clear so it was difficult to tell how much of the illumination was caused by the Sun's reflection, but it appeared to reflect the Sun differently than normal metal would. The object was stationary and than made a few sharp 90 degree movements at a speed that would be impossible for any none technology to replicate.  It then seemed to have a rapid elevation again unlike any none aircraft could, which made its visibility more like a bright dot.  A couple of seconds later it disappeared from sight.  We all seen the same thing, and all agreed we had just witnessed a UFO sighting.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
