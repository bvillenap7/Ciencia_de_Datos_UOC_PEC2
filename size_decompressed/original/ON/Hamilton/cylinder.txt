At 0330 hrs llOct2013 I wasn't able to sleep, so I went outside on my porch where it was quiet, and tried to relax enough to fall asleep, when I looked over my neighbor's roof top and saw a very unusual light flashing in the sky.  It was hovering in the south east sky at an approximate angle of approx. 25 degrees above  the horizon.   It hovered for a while in on spot emitting  pulsating red,white,pinkgreen/white  purple/blue, and reddish white pulsating lights.  After hovering a while it started moving off toe the SEE across the sky brighter than can be then just in a split 1/10 it disappeared.  That was very strange   I set up my digital camera on a tripot and filmed the craft hovering then moving slowly horizontally to the SEE.   Have a video of the it.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
