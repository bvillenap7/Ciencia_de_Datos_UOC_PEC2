Arc shaped object, unexplainable.;2004-05-27 05:00:00;10 Seconds;Arc shaped object, unexplainable. Tuesday, May 27th, 2004. 5:00AM  After watching a movie on my computer, I went upstairs to the back porch to have a cigarette. I was standing, facing away from the house, looking up at a star which I believed to be the planet Mars because it had a reddish tint to it.  I was distracted by an object moving diagonally and downwards, coming in over the neighbor's roof to my left, possibly 1000 or so feet off the ground. At fisrt I thought it was a bat or some sort of bird. It was moving quite quickly and was about to go behind the tree in my backyard when I got a better look at it.  The object was almost translucent. It looked as though it had the texture of smoke, or a cloud, yet it retained its shape perfectly, as it flew threw the air. I would define its shape as an arc, a sort of more rounded boomerang. The object then went behind the tree, and was temporarily out of view. I saw it come out the other side, only to change direction, and head in an almost downwardly only direction.  I realized then, that what I was looking at was not a bird or bad or smoke or cloud or any terrestrial craft I have ever seen. Then the object simply disapeared.  I was, and still am, in a heavy state of panic and awe. I was in tears at the overwhelming site of the unknown. (I'm not crazy, it sounds weird, I know, but what would you do if you saw something you thought was from another world.) I will be deeply moved for the rest of my life.  It should, however, be noted, that on this same day, I watched a special on TV with my housemate about UFO's, and have read numerous books about the subject. But, I had remained more of a skeptic on the subject, and have seen dozens of shows and documenteries and yet have never seen anything this remotely unexplainable. I had always figured that if I ever saw something out of the ordinary, it would be something similar to what I have been exposed to in films and television specials, and I would have doubts in my mind about the whole experience.  I am still shaking terribly and there are shivers down my spine. I have no doubts.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
I've seen satellites before but not west to east ever.;2013-08-24 21:00:00;5 minutes;I've seen satellites before but not west to east ever. The object just flew from west to east across the sky slowly.  It was brighter than star Arcturus and had No flashing I'd lights.  It moved like a sattelite.

Unknown Anomaly Seen In the Night Sky.;2014-09-08 19:30:00;10 minutes;Unknown Anomaly Seen In the Night Sky. I was out for a walk around 7:30 pm last night, when I noticed a strange row of lights in the sky.  I tried to take a picture with my phone but it did not turn out.  (my phone is 5yrs old)   It looked like 7 orange spheres in a v-shape formation.  They were hovering over the city in the south east location, out towards an area we call the punch bowl.  I stood there and watched them for about 10 minutes...they were just hovering and then they just disappeared.  I checked various weather information sites to see if perhaps it could be related to something.  It wasn't.   I also checked the city's airport schedules for departures and arrivals of aircraft or any special events and there were none at that time.  I know what I saw and it was an anomaly of unknown character.  They emitted a radiant light....at one point the light at the ends orbs shot upward and formed a circle. So it looked like a V with semi-circle enclosure.  It was an amazing site!! I do not know what this was..!  I just know that it was not something that could be described as anything yet known to this world.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
