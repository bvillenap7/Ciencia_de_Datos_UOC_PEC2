They were in a diamond formation. They were very dark grey in colour.  I at first thought they were fighter planes but when my boyfriend saw them he said no way because they had no definition.  They were solid grey with no markings of any kind.  No lights or smoke trails. There was no sound even.  When the air show comes in the summer you can hear them flying but these had no sound at all. They zig zaged for about 10 seconds then vanished.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
