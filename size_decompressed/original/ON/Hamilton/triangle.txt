Greyish black, long, narrow , triangular shaped ufo changed direction at a 45 degree angle.;1999-06-17 14:30:00;5 minutes;Greyish black, long, narrow , triangular shaped ufo changed direction at a 45 degree angle. The one craft seemed to be high in the sky but far away. The colour was greyish black. It looked like a long and narrow triangle.  It appeared that the craft was flying slowly in a northerly direction and then shot up very quickly at a 45 degree angle. It flew up so fast that I could barely keep my eyes on it. I was alone when I witnessed the craft. There was no curviture in it's turn it appeared that it changed direction on a pin head. In that area the land is flat, lots of trees, and new subdivisions. Beyond that it is rural area.  My profession is a Legal Land Surveyor, and my eyesight is excellent.  Since I was 8 years old my hobby has been studying military aircraft of WWI and WW2.  I am extremely knowledgeable in the field of aircraft and I can say that to me this was a ufo.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275

UFO Sighted While Driving to see Lord of the Rings, Nearly Causing the Car to Crash!!!;2002-01-02 20:30:00;1 minute;UFO Sighted While Driving to see Lord of the Rings, Nearly Causing the Car to Crash!!! Shortly after picking a friend up we were driving down this road on our way to see Lord of the Rings, and I looked into the sky to see this shape in the sky. I screamed, and actually went off of the road for a little bit. My friends then looked at the sky and were too terrified. There was no way this was a plane, and it was the scariest thing we had ever seen. Within a minutes time, we could no longer see it, but it was something that we will NEVER forget.

Strange orbs in the sky followed by an enormous boomerang shaped craft.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-01 22:30:00;24 minutes;Strange orbs in the sky followed by an enormous boomerang shaped craft. Around 22:00 hrs I went outside and looked North and was observing the Big Dipper. At that time I saw several orb like bright figures dancing in the sky above me. At this time I had observed 6 and all were headed South East. At this time I texted my 15 year old daughter to come outside. Upon her arrival we witnessed approximately 6 more of these orb like crafts. Although all headed South East some would quickly accelerate higher up in the sky only to almost bounce back to their original location.  After about 20 minutes the activity died down. We decided that we should go back in the house but decided to take a few more minutes to observe. At 22:54 we suddenly observed an enormous boomerang shaped object slightly to the East of our location. I would guess that this object was approximately the width of a football field. This object was approximately 500 feet above us. This object was silent and did not have any lights. I am assuming that it was metallic in colour as it seemed to reflect the night sky. I immediately felt all of the hair on my body stand up. It moved very slowly Southbound. We observed this strange craft for 10 seconds before it vanished completely. At approximately 23:00 hrs we observed a helicopter in our area which was strange for so late at night.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
