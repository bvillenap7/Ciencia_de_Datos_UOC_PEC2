2 small lights (like stars) which were very high up and moved in rapid and highly erratic patterns;1999-08-25 23:00:00;30 seconds;2 small lights (like stars) which were very high up and moved in rapid and highly erratic patterns Hello,  I am writing about a sighting I witnessed with my mother approximately 5 years ago.  I was a graduate student in neurobiology at the time and my mother had come to visit me at my apartment for a few days (she is a teacher).  One evening, around eleven o'clock, we were standing on my balcony looking up at the stars before retiring to bed.  My apartment balcony faced southwest, and it was a very clear summer night.  We were standing by the railing, engaged in conversation while just enjoying the view.  As I was looking around, I noticed a what first looked like a star moving in a straight line from southwest to northeast (it seems to be moving in a direction that would eventually pass directly overhead).  I then noticed another point of light very close to it.  When I first noticed the two lights, they were at around a 50 degree angle to the horizon and were approximately thumbs width apart.  I pointed them out to my mother.  At this time I assumed they were satellites. I have seen satellites many times before and these appeared like them.  They were moving slightly faster than other satellites I have observed however.  As they moved closer to being almost directly overhead, they suddenly did something no satellite would do.  Both lights began moving in a completely erratic manner.  They slowed, then began forming loops in the sky, weaving to and fro and forming circles and zig-zagging manouvers with smooth precision.  We continued to watch until they passed out of our sight beyond the roof of the apartment building directly overhead.  At this point my mother and I both looked at each other and didn't even need to speak.  But when we did, we both wondered what in the world we had just seen.  They seemed the brightness of a star or satellite, but moved in a completely different way.  There was no sound, no colour change (the lights were pinkish).  They were very high up, they were not insects, birds, airplanes or helicopters.  I have been interested in astronomy for years, have taken several university courses on the subject, and I have observed comets, meteor showers and even a fireball or two.  What my mother and I saw that night neither of us could explain, and we still wonder about it to this day.  I was listening to Coast to Coast AM last night and heard Mr. Davenport implore people to report their sightings, so I am doing so now.  Thank you, Sincerely ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
lights in a seemingly semi-circle pattern an 'X' outline on the vessels underbelly with white lights and a red light;2002-01-18 05:45:00;2 minutes;lights in a seemingly semi-circle pattern an 'X' outline on the vessels underbelly with white lights and a red light I was partying at a friend's house on Friday January 18. Everyone had fallen asleep by about 5:00AM and i was the only one left awake . I decided to clean up my friend's rather attrocious house and this required taking the garbage outside to the garbage bin. It was a somewhat clear night with only a few clouds in the sky.  There wasn't anyone up and the streets were silent. As I placed the garbage bags into the bin I noticed a bright light far away on the horizon. I remember only glancing at the sight as I assumed it was merely a plane or chopper. It should be noted that I had previously been a skeptic when it came to UFO sightingings. As I turned to enter the house the light began an unbelievable ascent into the sky. I say unbelievable because of the rate at which the object could climb. It was at this very moment that I first entertained the notion of this vessel being an unidentified flying object. The light seemed to be emanating from one source but if I glanced away for the briefest moment the light appeared to be made up of mutiple lights that were arranged in a semi-circle pattern. The object had risen to an enormous height in the sky and I thought it was going to disappear into the night when suddenly it began a descent with the velocity at which it had previously risen. I remember a feeling of fright coming over me. As a rational person I was terrified at the notion that something inexplicable could exist, and yet here it was before me. The object appeared to be coming in my direction as it descended. I lost sight of the object for a second and then it re-appeared directly overhead. I estimate it must have been about a mile-and-a-half above the ground. It sliced through the clouds effortlessly and as soon as it had appeared overhead, it was gone. The underpannel was marked with an 'X' and had white lights outlining this shape. There appeared to be a red light moving around the object in a circular pattern. I remember hearing a low buzzing sound that accompanied the vessel as it flew overhead. ! I was co mpletely overwhelmed and spent the remainder of the morning debating whether i had actually seen what i had thought i had seen and whether or not it would be worth telling anyone at all.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
Star like object following satellite;2002-08-18 23:10:00;60 seconds;Star like object following satellite My wife and i were sitting outside talking with my parents who were visiting and noticed a steady moving object that looked like a star very high up we thought it was probably a satellite because we usually see them at the cottage. when all of a sudden a smaller star like object rushed behind it at an incredible speed and stopped directly beside it then turned in a small circle 180 degrees I could actually see the circle it made as it moved and then took off very fast in the opposite direction it took a about 3 or 4 for seconds for it to cross the entire visible sky.Unfortunately my wife and parents were still looking at the larger object as I was franticaly trying to get them to look at what I was looking at but it was too late by the time they turned there heads.It was still an amazing thing and I have never seen anything move that quick before.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
2 bright lights simutaneously travelling north - Hamilton Ontario Canada -;2005-10-01 20:08:00;15 seconds;2 bright lights simutaneously travelling north - Hamilton Ontario Canada - I was sitting in my lawn chair in my back yard facing north-east. I was glancing up and looked over head and saw 2 lights high in the sky almost directly over-head.  The lights were positioned in front of each other travelling north.  Like when you tow something it follows at the same speed and direction.  The lights were bright white and stayed on consistanty.  No other flashing lights - I could not see a craft in between just sky seperating them.  The 2 lights about one hand's width apart (hand held out at arm's length) in front of each other travelling north at the same speed. They were white and brighter that anything else in the sky.  Both lights were equal in brightness.  It took about 15 seconds as the lights steadily dimmed as it went out of sight to the north.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
Fast moving flash of light.;2007-06-29 22:15:00;6 seconds;Fast moving flash of light. There was a light flashing down.  Looked like a falling star. then it zigzaged twice, really fast and then disappeared straight up.  Moved unlike any airplane or other air craft.  An experience I will never forget. Glad to have seen.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
While observing the stars I noticed a small circular light moving around in a circular motion.;2008-05-13 04:40:00;3-4 mins;While observing the stars I noticed a small circular light moving around in a circular motion. A friend and I were on break at 4:40 A.M. I was observing the stars as I usually do and noticed a moving object. It was like a star but moving at a fast pace. I watched and waited in shock. Then it stopped, and started doing circles. As soon as it stopped I grabbed my friend by the arm and told him to look. It took him a few seconds to see what I was seeing but when he did we were both in awe. It was a star shaped circular object. There was no colour or sound, just a white light. We observed this object for 3-4 minutes before an airplane made it’s  way into the area. As soon as the airplane came into view the object took off and that was all we seen of it.  I am a believer in ET life forms, but I was still in shock. I have been trying to get my friend to listen to some of the stories told about UFO’s for the longest time , so it was kind of funny that we both got to see this together. I am an assistant Produce manager at a major grocery chain in my area, he is a FT night-shift clerk.  This took place over or around the  Limeridge Mall area where my friend and I both work in Hamilton Ontario.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
Large, bright, colourful star-like object hovering over Dundas, Ontario.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly the star, Sirius?  PD));2012-12-05 17:25:00;~10 minutes;Large, bright, colourful star-like object hovering over Dundas, Ontario Travelling Down/Eastbound on 403, I witnessed what looked to be a star of enormous proportions - all the while changing colours very quickly.  Then, what looked to be an aircraft seemed to be passing or following the orb of light, just below it, and travelling slowly from right to left.  It did not appear to move in the sky as teh smaller plane or object did, and since I was on the highway, it became obscured by the landscape once I travelled down the escarpment.

Metallic light appears, changes direction and vanishes.;2013-10-27 02:45:00;~1 minute;Metallic light appears, changes direction and vanishes. On a rooftop downtown Hamilton (Sherman & Burlington) looking east-southeast.  Visibility was good, could see for miles -- there were clouds but they were defined and had clear borders.  See a lit, metallic object, moving slowly south-to-north.  The light was white, maybe slightly orange.  Don't know exactly how far away it was, but fairly far.  Noticing it looking weird, I make a remark, and it caught the attention of others. The object changed direction very slowly and vanished.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
Pulsing green lights in Lake Ontario.;2014-05-31 00:05:00;2 hours;Pulsing green lights in Lake Ontario. Looking across to Toronto from Hamilton just after midnight we saw a line of 10-15 flashing green lights in Lake Ontario.  They stretched from about Pickering as far as we could see to the east.   These green lights would pulse and seemed to have a white light above them in the air.  The green lights seemed to be on the Lake.  Periodically a flame, or some light source, would emit from the flashing green light to the white light up above.   This is the weirdest thing I have ever seen.   This was happening for at least 2 hours. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275

Just after 2pm, I heard a jet in the sky, i looked up and seen a privet jet and on its right side tailing it was a glow of light following along side.  Have never seen anything like it,   I told my father to look but he didn't see it, being 83.  Thought i was seeing things, I told him what i just seen.   I'm sure if you contacted Mount Hope airport in Hamilton, the prvt jet would of been on the radar.  Just after or around 2pm ....heading north/northeast over the city of Hamilton.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
Convoy traveling across the sky.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-04-10 21:15:00;10 minutes;Clear sky. I began to see one orb that appeared to be a satellite come out from behind a tree. Then I noticed another and another. It seemed like it was a convoy traveling across the sky. There were 10+ object that eventually took up the whole sky in a line. As they reached the other end they curved and faded out.  I continued to periodically check the sky and saw more of these objects (looking like satellites)  appearing and fading into existence. one by the constellation Orion specifically. I’ve never seen a satellite curve.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
