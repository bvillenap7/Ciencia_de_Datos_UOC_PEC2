Oddly lit large craft over Hamilton at or shortly after 7pm on Haloween.;2003-10-31 19:00:00;5 minutes;Oddly lit large craft over Hamilton at or shortly after 7pm on Haloween. In response to the report from BC on this date. I actually was checking to see if anyone saw what I saw on the same night in Hamilton, Ontario.  I saw a similar craft, from a great distance (at least four miles), over Hamilton on Haloween night (friday).  There were thousands of people in the streets at this time, so others may report it.  At first I thought it was an airplane, as there is an airport in Hamilton.  However, this craft was lighted all along the length of the craft, unlike an airplane, and it had some blue, red and white lights, flashing, within the overall white/blue light of the craft.  It struck me right away that this may be an aircraft..but I've never seen one lit up like that before, and we have them here all the time.  I attempted to get to a better vantage point quickly, but had to proceed with caution since the streets were filled with children.  When I got there, the object was gone.  Our airplanes do not have blue lights?  Our airplanes do not light up so you can see them at night...only their nav lights and headlamps.  Aura is a very good description of the type of lighting I observed.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
It had lights that were flashing, white and red, maybe even yellow (light) it was going faster then any plane I've ever seen.;2005-02-12 18:40:00;ten minutes;It had lights that were flashing, white and red, maybe even yellow (light) it was going faster then any plane I've ever seen. Me and my friend were outside of her house. We just so happen to start talking about aliens and abductions, when out of the dark winter sky we seen an unclear shaped light that kept changing colours comming from the north-west heading towards us. At first we thought it was a UFO, but people joke around about that all the time. The craft was going much faster then a normal airplane. about at least 3 or 4 times faster. We got scared as the object at flight was moving farther away, yet looking as if it was to land. At the west another object at flight seemed to follow the craft, we believe it to have been an airplane. Just a bit after the airplane and object at flight had dissappeared, another, from the same spot as the other appeared it appeared. It looked exactly the same as the first object at flight, it may just have been the same one that just turned around. In the same amount as the other one took it dissappeared, in the same spot. The objects that are believede to be UFOs were just about 100 feet above the ground, or less.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
No craft was seen.  2 small not so loud bangs, Claps, then one loud bang that made dogs in the neighborhood bark.  You not only heard t;2019-06-17 02:12:00;Seconds;No craft was seen.  2 small not so loud bangs, Claps, then one loud bang that made dogs in the neighborhood bark.  You not only heard the bang but felt it.  It was a clear night not weather anomalies noted as per environment Canada.  This actually shook the house.  There is video/audio of said event on reddit if you are looking to hear it.  No answers from local media everyone is;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
Bright white object that disappeared twice or was 2 objects;2020-08-29 18:40:00;90 seconds;Bright white object that disappeared twice or was 2 objects It was mostly clear skies. Though there were some white billowing clouds covering the sunset from the West to the West North. Otherwise I would probably not seen the object. It looked cigar shaped and bright white. It first appeared about sixty degrees up from the horizon.  It did not look to be moving and it slowly disappeared. My friend asked what I was looking at and I said it is gone.  Though I continued looking at the same spot to see if it was indeed gone.  She began looking in the sky with me. However, as she and I looked I noticed it again but at about forty degrees in the horizon this time.  It was a little bit to the left of the first position.  It looked exactly the same size.  It acted the same as the first time and slowly disappeared. The person with me said it must be a balloon and I just agreed.  LOL;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
