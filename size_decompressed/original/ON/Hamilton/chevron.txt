Fiery cheveron shape descends in the sky.;2006-11-24 12:45:00;4-5 seconds;Fiery cheveron shape descends in the sky. This was likely just a very large meteor burning up in the sky, but it doesn't hurt to report it anyways.  I was sitting on the back deck and saw what looked like, at first, an airplane crashing.  It's shape resembled something similar to a cheveron, which is what led me to believe an airplane had it's wings on fire.  There was still a firey haze engulfing the full circumference, but it was brightest on the outer sides.   It was almost coming down completely vertically, but was offset about 15 degrees say about 255 degrees if a circle was used as a reference in the sky.   It burned for about 4-5 seconds, and then disappeared when it was about 3 seconds from impact with the ground.  It didn't disappear into the horizon there was still room left in the sky for it to descend.  It made no audible sound in the sky (I took my headphones off in awe after seeing it for the first couple seconds) and there was no impact sound or feeling.  Truely amazing.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
