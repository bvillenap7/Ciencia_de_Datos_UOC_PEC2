Large fire-ball being followed by about 12 smaller fire balls, travelling in a ENE direction.;1999-11-16 19:13:00;15 sec;Large fire-ball being followed by about 12 smaller fire balls, travelling in a ENE direction. My wife and I observed this large fire-ball travelling in an ENE direction at about 19:13 hrs on 11/16/99. The object(s) were travelling at a speed much slower than I am used to seeing a meteor travel at. My first impression was that an aircraft was on fire. The object seemed to be directly overhead and took about 15 seconds to cover my field of view. This is my third encounter of this type. If you check on Alta Vista for Harwood Ontario you might find some material on my first sighting some years ago.This one was a day-time sighting and left a noticeable smoke trail. The other sighting was about two years ago in Hamilton and looked almost identical to last nights, although slightly smaller. To the best of my knowledge they were both thought to be re-entering space junk. Having had fifteen seconds to observe this last sighting, I am leaning towards the space junk theory. Not to denegrate anyones theories on UFOs , but this object last night was most definitely some sort of fire-ball. Looking at a map of N.A. it would appear that this object would have gone over Central Mich., S. Ontario, N. NY, Vermont, Maine Nova Scotia and S. Newfoundland.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
