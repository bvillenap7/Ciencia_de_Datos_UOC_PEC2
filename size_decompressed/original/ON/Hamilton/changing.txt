I SAW THIS THING WHICH WAS IN THE SHAPE OF A LARGE BUTTERFLY (ABOUT 10 MILES IN DIAMETER) AT OR NEAR HAMILTON CIVIC AIRPORT;1977-07-20 23:45:00;10 MINUTES;I SAW THIS THING WHICH WAS IN THE SHAPE OF A LARGE BUTTERFLY (ABOUT 10 MILES IN DIAMETER) AT OR NEAR HAMILTON CIVIC AIRPORT AT ABOUT 11:45 P. M. ON JULY 20, 1978.  I WAS STANDING WAITING FOR A HAMILTON STREET RAILWAY COMPANY UPPER JAMES 27 BUS WHEN I SAW THIS OBJECT.   I TOLD THE PEOPLE AT THE HAMILTON-WENTWORTH REGIONAL POLICE THE NEXT DAY, AND THEY SAID THAT THEY DO NOT INVESTIGATE UFO'S.  SO I WROTE A LETTER TO THE J. ALLEN HYNEK CENTER FOR UFO STUDIES IN EVANSTON, ILLINOIS, AND THEY SAID THAT THEY DO NOT INVESTIGATE UFO'S OVER CANADIAN TERRITORY.  AFTER THAT ISSUE, I WROTE ANOTHER LETTER TO THE NATIONAL INVESTIGATIONS COMMITTEE OF AERIAL PHONOMEN IN TEXAS, AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD LOOK INTO IT.  I NEVER HEARD FROM THEM AGAIN.  WHAT SHOULD I DO NEXT? PLEASE GET BACK TO ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. ((NUFORC Note:  The case is 31 years olde.  We believe that no amount of investigation would extract any more information about the sighting than what the witness has provided.  PD));43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
