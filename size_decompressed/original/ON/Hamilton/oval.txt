Oval shaped craft over Canada;2006-03-14 22:35:00;5 minutes;Oval shaped craft over Canada While locking up the house at approx 2235 hrs, I noticed a brigh orange light over the roof of my neighbours residence.  I was'nt surprised by this since our area is in the flight path of he local airport.  At this hour though, it is typically courier flights inbound from the US.  One other oddity was the fact that the oblect was going paralell to the flight path normally used by the aircraft.  The orange light was moving away from my position, slowly and did not appear to change altitude.  I did not see anyother craft at first and would estimate that it was around 2 miles from my position.As I watched, another orange light approached from the south and flew paralell to the first object.  The two craft then changed color to a dull red and seemed to elongate into an oval shape befor they sped off out of sight within seconds.  The red effect trailed out behind them and appeared to, wave as if in turbulance, (sic).  The sky was cloudly with an outside temperature of ) degrees celsius.  I watched the news and heard nothing of anyother reports in the area.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
