Red and white or white and red running lights.;1975-08-15 22:00:00;5 minutes;Red and white or white and red running lights. I'm from Hamilton, Ontario.  At the time, I was living on the west end mountain.  In the mid 70'S on a hot August summer night, I opened my back door of my house.  At the time, the airport had a curfew around ten or eleven pm.  I noticed what I thought was a plane but it was past the curfew.  I took a double look thinking it was moving but it was sitting in mid air.  The reason I noticed the thing in the first place was the running lights.  The running lights were two colors red and white.  They ran around the edge of the ship .   The UFO was no more than hundred yards away and about forty feet off the ground.  I could see the shape of the ship without any mistake what it was.  The ship tilted down slightly on its right side and started to move sideways for a city block or so and stopped.  I don't know if I felt something in the air or if I saw the thing about to take off but the ship from a sitting position it took off in a blink of an eye.  My question I have always thought was that made by human's or was that alien made?  If you ever have chance to look at an u-tube video from 2011 of a UFO on a back a flat bed tuck, pretty much the some ship.   Thank You ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275

3 Sightings Over Lake Ontario;2006-04-03 07:30:00;Seconds;3 Sightings Over Lake Ontario Hey, my name is ((deleted)). I live in hamilton ontario canada. I have witnessed 3 UFO sittings, over the past couple of months over Lake Ontario. In hamilton there is a street called burlington street which goes straight towards the lake, so you can see a full view of lake ontario while you are driving, i drive this was every morning around 7:30 - 7:45ish. My first sighting happened about 3 months ago, when me and my friend were driving down burlington street at 7:45, there was clouds covering the lower part of the lake, but it was a bright sky above the clouds, now all these sightings have happen while i was driving, so we only caught glimplses of them. all of a sudden we saw something shot through the clouds and into the sky, leaving behind a straight line in the clouds. we thought it was really weird.. the second sighting happen at the same time 7:45 while were driving on burlington street again, it was a clear sky, and we saw just a little swiggle in the sky, and it was not moving just sitting there, and i have seen video of the exact same sighting before, it was very weird. But todays sighting topped everything, as we were again driving down burlington street, looking at the view of the lake.. i thought i saw a bird glidding into the wind, but then i relized, it wasnt moving, me and my buddy started to take a closer look, it was a craft!! hovering over the lake, in a disk shaped form!! just sitting there watching all the cars going by on the highway. i know what i saw and it was for sure a disk. I know that there is alot of sighting over lake ontario, know i know why. Ive witnessed 3 of them. If you have any questions please get back to me.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
Glowing, misty orange-red disc shaped object flys by 1 1/2 km distance from me.;2014-08-21 22:30:00;2-3 minutes;Glowing, misty orange-red disc shaped object flys by 1 1/2 km distance from me. Unidentified Flying Object report witnessed Thursday August 21 @ approx 10:30pm Hamilton, Ontario.  Area:  Where Upper James and the Lincoln Alexander highway intersect. ((name deleted))  I live in Hamilton Ontario on the mountain.  In the area where Upper James and the Lincoln Alexander highway intersect.  I was on my deck looking towards the south.  There is a large tree to the right of my backyard (southwest).  From behind the tree about 1 1/2 km away, about 1 km above the ground the object first came into my line of vision.  It moved at the speed of a slow moving plane, or helicopter going from south west to south east.  This was no plane or helicopter though. It was disc shaped and its color was orange/red.  It was difficult to make out its exact shape because there was some kind of vapour effect that surrounded it.  Kind of looked like it was on fire.  But no flames were visible.  It just had this bright orangy red glow with a fiery mist that trailed behind it and surrounded it. At first I thought it must have been a meteor.  But meteors don’t move that slow. The object continued at the same speed and headed southwest.  But as it was getting further and more of its back was facing me, its appearance changed.  The orange red colour seemed to fade off and there appeared to be this umbrella-like white-ish swirling vortex that seemed to be coming from the front of the object.  Perhaps this vortex was creating its orange red appearance?  It continued on its way until I could no longer see it. The whole event lasted only a few minutes.  I do not know what it was I saw.  Let me be clear though.  I was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol.  I have always been a believer of UFO’s, aliens etc., and have spend 2 decades studying the phenomena.  I have met at least 4 people in my life who are first eye witnesses to UFO encounters.  I always dreamed of having my own experience.  But let me tell you, now that it has happened, my reaction is not what I thought it would be.  I am deeply bothered by it.  I am trying to be as rational as possible as to what I witnessed.  My description is as accurate as I can make it.  I would like some kind of rational explaination. Is it some kind of military vehicle?  I don’t know.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275

I was sit;2016-07-24 00:45:00;10-15 seconds;	It was approximately 12:45 am (00:45) in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, when I heard a faint whirring sound coming from outside.  I was sitting in my living room, inside my apartment, watching TV.  I turned my head to look out the screen door of my balcony, thinking it might be someone flying a toy helicopter (because I was not expecting what I saw), and instead see a green light just sitting there, about the same brightness of a star, but bigger than the typical one observed in the sky at night.  As it just sat there still, the whirring noise had stopped. 	About five seconds had passed, when I then said out loud to my mother, who was sitting next to me, “What is that?”  I watched it for about another five seconds, and as I stood up to get a closer look, the light started to move again.  As it moved, I got a clearer look at if the light was coming off of anything – it was coming off of a grey disc/saucer shaped object.  The object made a slight turn, almost like a U-turn, and then ascended up higher into the sky and came towards my apartment building, flying up and away above it.  The whole time it was moving, the whirring sound occurred. 	I went outside onto my balcony and looked around but I could no longer see it. My mother had not seen anything but she believed me when I told her what I saw.  I only observed one saucer but it was moving much faster and stranger than an airplane or helicopter would.  I am not sure if anyone else observed this, whether from their balconies or the street below.  I am almost positive that what I saw was a UFO. 	About 5 minutes after the sighting, my cat started acting extremely weird.  She started running around the apartment, jumping and sliding on our rug.  I don’t know if UFO’s have the tendency to affect animal behaviour, but I found it extremely weird for her to starting acting like this all of a sudden.   As for my background, I am a female born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, having recently moved to Hamilton.  I am Caucasian.;43.2469903133905;-79.8718776353275
