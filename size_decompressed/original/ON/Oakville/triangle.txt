LOOKING S.W OVER LAKE ONTARIO LARGE TRIANGLE,BRIGHT WHITE/YELLOW LIGHTS AT POINTS.NOT MOVING.AT ARMS LENGHT DISTANCE FULL THUMB APPRX 3;1999-11-17 17:45:00;4 MIN;LOOKING S.W OVER LAKE ONTARIO LARGE TRIANGLE,BRIGHT WHITE/YELLOW LIGHTS AT POINTS.NOT MOVING.AT ARMS LENGHT DISTANCE FULL THUMB APPRX 3.1/4 INCHS DRIVING SOUTH ON GRAND BLVD ( CROSS STREET UPPERMIDDLE RD ) NOTICED THREE LIGHTS SHAPED LIKE A TRIANGLE. THOUGHT IT WAS STRANGE THAT THREE AIRCRAFT WOULD BE TRAVELLING IN A PERFECT TRIANGLE.I STOPPED FOR A RED LIGHT AND CONT'D TO WATCH. THE LIGHTS DID NOT MOVE AND THE OBJECT DID NOT LOSE ITS TRIANGULAR SHAPE. THE LIHTS AT THE APEXES WERE FAIRLY BRIGHT. THEY DIDN'T FLICKER BUT I'M SURE THEY HAD A WHITE THEN WHITE/YELLOW THEN WHITE APPEARANCE. THIS OBJECT WAS HUGE, I HELD MY ARM OUT AND THE OBJECT WAS AS BIG AS MY FULL THUMB FROM WHERE IT JOINS MY HAND TO THE TIP APPRX 3.1/4 INCHES . IT WAS ALMOST DARK ( HEAVY DUSK )I OBSERVED THAT THE INSIDE THE TRIANGLE WAS DARKER THAN THE SKY , THUS GIVING IT SHAPE/FULLNESS. IT WAS THIS OBSERVATION THAT CONVINCED ME THAT I WAS DEFINATLY OBSERVING SOMETHING ABNORMAL. I DROVE EAST ON UPPERMIDDLE RD FOR APPRX 1 MILE THEN PROCEDED SOUTH ON FORD DRIVE LOOKING WEST IT WAS STILL THERE... HUGE !! AT THIS POINT I JOINED THE HWY AND LOST SIGHT. I PHONED MY WIFE RIGHT AWAY AND SHE WENT OUSIDE TO THE END OF THE DRIVE AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE THE OBJECT. SHE PHONED ME BACK RIGHT AWAY AND SAW NOTHING. I WAS TRAVELLING EAST SO I CAREFULLY LOOKED BACK TO THE SOUTH WEST  NOW EXPECTING TO SEE THREE PLANES OR SOMETHING BUT THERE WAS NOTHING NOTHING AT ALL. THERE WERE NO STARS IN THE SKY AT THIS TIME. THERE WAS 1/2 MOON, BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOUTH EAST OF ME SHAPE                 *       LIGHTS AT TIPS *                    * END;43.4627371212121;-79.7225613636364
Single ship with three balls of light sent out from it;2008-04-06 23:00:00;10 seconds;Single ship with three balls of light sent out from it At approximately 11pm I was sitting on my balcony looking up at the sky smoking a cigarette, and I saw a strange looking triangular ship in the sky with a blue light at the front and two bright red lights at the back. I thought at first it was a low flying plane on a really odd angle, then three yellow balls of light came out from the tail end of it. They were a little larger than the stars. They swirled around in the sky for a couple of seconds before all joining together in a bundle and flying off towards northwest.;43.4627371212121;-79.7225613636364
Fast moving object, 3x faster than passenger plane.;2014-06-03 23:06:00;1 minute;Fast moving object, 3x faster than passenger plane. Every night Me and my co-worker eat lunch together outside.  Being a amateur astronomy I always do a scan of the sky it was a clear beautiful clear sky. I quickly noticed almost straight up a light moving at about 3x the speed of a passenger plane at I guess cruising altitude. I would say similar to when you see them with contrails. Object description - 3 Points of light possibly a triangle or round.  No Sound.  To high to see any details other than the lights. It was very surreal.  How could something move so fast?  It looked so unnatural. We followed it as much as we could until it made a half circle turn!  SO Weird. After the half turn it went past the roof of our company and could no longer follow it. Direction traveled was West to East and than turned North. This was my first sighting of a UFO, as was my friends who was left mystified. ((name deleted));43.4627371212121;-79.7225613636364
