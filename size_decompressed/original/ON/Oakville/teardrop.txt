I see that it is a 2 foot in diameter teardrop shape that looked like it was full of dense fluid.;2019-05-05 00:00:00;1-2 minutes;I live on the top floor of my building.  I turned all the lights out and went to bed.  At approximately 2 a.m., I quietly went to my balcony to have a cigarette.  I was sitting in complete darkness.   As I sat there, I see a bright object coming out from the darkness coming from around the corner of my balcony.  As the object floats over to the middle of my balcony, I see that it is a 2 foot in diameter teardrop shape that looked like it was full of dense fluid that was brightly lit dark blue with sparkles at the top.  It floated right in front of me about 4 feet away.   My first thought was I just caught a Hersey Kiss drone spying on apartments.  I didnt feel afraid although I felt as though I had caught the glowing teardrop spying on me.  When the object realized I was there in the dark it diminished itself.  The sparkles on the top/tail consumed the blue dense light and disappeared.  At that moment I knew it wasn't a drone.;43.4627371212121;-79.7225613636364
