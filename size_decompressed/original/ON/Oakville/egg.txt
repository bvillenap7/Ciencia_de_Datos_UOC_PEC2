Egg shaped object small perhaps 9 to 10 feet silent hovering.;1974-06-01 13:00:00;1 min;Egg shaped object small perhaps 9 to 10 feet silent hovering. I saw it from my kitchen window perhaps 20 feet it was still near the roof of a house across from my window.  It was egg shaped and full on antennas.   I moved away from the window to reach my wall phone and when I returned it was gone.   I was scared so I did not go outside to check if it was still around.   I never mentioned it to anyone.   We lived about 2 blocks from the Ontario lake and farming areas. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));43.4627371212121;-79.7225613636364
