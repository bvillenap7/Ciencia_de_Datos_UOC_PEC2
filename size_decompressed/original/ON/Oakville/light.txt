Bright flashing light north of Dundas St. in Oakville - Anyone notice this?;2004-07-12 23:30:00;1/2 hour+;Bright flashing light north of Dundas St. in Oakville - Anyone notice this? I was travelling east on Dundas St in Oakville on July 12th 2004 at approximately 11:30pm when i noticed that North of the highway (close to Trafalgar Rd.) there was a huge bright flash in the sky. The light would continue to repeat itself in 2 second intervals. But the light was bright enough to light up the sky as thunder does. There are only farms and fields in that area that I know of and no tall towers or offices. I know that I'm not the only one who saw this as many drivers were looking at the light while we were stopped at Dundas and Trafalger's intersection. I wanted to know if anyone else noticed this last night also? Or is this something new to the area? It's bright enought that i'm sure someone would have complained.;43.4627371212121;-79.7225613636364
Orange Light in northeast Oakville Ontario 15-July-2012 - 1:30PM;2012-07-15 01:30:00;2 minutes;Orange Light in northeast Oakville Ontario 15-July-2012 - 1:30PM Myself, my wife and two neighbours were out chatting early in the morning chatting outside our house.  I noticed an orange light to the northeast of us moving fairly quickly in a diagonal direction from right to left, from about 30 degrees to 60 degrees above the horizon.  It then stopped fairly abruptly and just hovered there for some time.  It then started to move slowly in a random pattern, kind of like a doodleart drawing, but not too far from a stationary position.  I used a street sign and a nearby object as a reference to see if it was just the illusion of movement or was actually moving, which it was. While generally stationary the light grew in intensity, and was quite bright, and seemed quite big.  It was slowly pulsing/shimmering, and was kind of fuzzy at the edges, kind of like the sun's corona but not as intense as the light itself. My neighbours work at Pearson Intl. Airport, and all four of us were quite certain it wasn't a plane, or a flare, due to its strange movement, seeming close proximity, the lack of landing lights, and no noise.  Airplanes do often track over our neighbourhood, so we are very familiar as to what they look/sound like, and they tend to follow the same track. After we studied it for a few minutes, it started to move again left to right, and then stopped again for a short time.  After stopping for a bit, it slowly diminished in intensity and winked out, but not before very briefly (1-2 sec) getting a bit brighter.;43.4627371212121;-79.7225613636364
Brilliant orange light or chinese lantern at or less than 1000 ft moving east to west across Oakville, Ontario midnight, June 9th 2013;2013-06-09 00:00:00;2 minutes;brilliant orange light or chinese lantern at or less than 1000ft moving east to west across Oakville, Ontario midnight, June 9th 2013 Around midnight on the 9th of June 2013 my sister ran from outside to call me to see something.  I ran outside and saw a very bright, orange light that seemed to be glowing brighter at it's center.  The light was about 700-1000ft in the air approximately 1/2 km from my position.  It seemed stationary, enough so that I took the liberty to run inside for my camera.  When I returned the 'light' was diminishing in size. Perhaps not extinguishing, but moving away rather quickly.  My sister, her husband, myself and finally my father were witnesses. Naturally, I was unable to capture it on film.  We're still discussing whether it could have been a chinese lantern.  We all agree the light was not bobbing and was definitely stationary at times.  The wind presently at Oakville, Ontario is from the NE at 13km/h.  The object was moving from east to west.;43.4627371212121;-79.7225613636364
Object in morning sky gets white bright and disappears;2016-08-12 08:10:00;30 seconds;Object in morning sky gets white bright and disappears Riding to work on the train, the morning was bright and sunny,  I was facing south towards Lake Ontario facing toward the Sun when I noticed a very bright light in the sky not far from the direction of the sun.  At first I thought it was a star but then realized there were no others anywhere and it was incredible bright considering it was so sunny out.  As I watched it for a few moments, it never moved but it began to intensify in brightness and then in an instant it disappeared completely.  It was gone in a flash.;43.4627371212121;-79.7225613636364
