SIX ORANGE LIGHT MOVING QUICKLY ACROSS A NIGHT SKY;2005-04-08 23:00:00;2 mins approx;SIX ORANGE LIGHT MOVING QUICKLY ACROSS A NIGHT SKY 6 ORANGE LIGHTS MOVING QUICKLY ACROSS A CLEAR NIGHT SKY.  I WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE STARS (THEY WERE VERY PRETTY) AND SAW A LIGHT MOVING.  I THOUGHT IT COULD BE A SATALLITE BUT THEN I SAW MORE LIGHTS.  I ASKED MY HUSBAND OUR 2 FRIENDS TO LOOK UP AND IF THEY KNEW WHAT THEY COULD BE.  THE LIGHTS WERE MOVING QUITE SWIFTLY AND SEEMED TO BE VERY HIGH UP.  WE CONCLUDED THAT THEY COULDN'T BE PLANES AS THEY WERE TOO CLOSE TO EACH AND CHANGED POSITION SEVERAL TIMES AND THERE WEREN'T ANY FLASHING LIGHTS OR NOISE.  WE THOUGHT THAT THEY MAY BE VERY LARGE WHITE BIRDS (SWANS MIGRATING) AND THAT MAY BE THE ORANGE GLOW FROM STREET LIGHTS MAY BE REFLECTING OFF THEM.  BUT AS THEY GOT FURTHER AWAY THE LIGHT INTENSITY DID NOT CHANGE AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE LIGHTS SEEMED TO BE TOO HIGH FOR US TO HAVE SEEN THE BIRDS.;43.4627371212121;-79.7225613636364
Low-frequency pulsing hum associated with aircraft lights flying around for over 40 minutes;2015-01-12 23:00:00;40 minutes;low frequency pulsing hum associated with aircraft lights flying around for over 40 minutes Woke up from a light sleep by an irritating low frequency pulsing hum that could not be localized, It felt as if it was inside my head.  Got out of bed and went to the window to see if there was any machinery on the street.  You could describe the sound as being like the idle of an engine but only in terms of rhythm.  This frequency was much lower than any engine.  I could almost feel this hum throughout my body. When I looked out onto the street, there was no activity.  However, there was what appeared to be several aircraft each with multiple lights in the sky.   After watching for a couple of minutes the configuration of the lights changed with the direction of the movement.  So you could assume the multiple white lights were at the front and multiple red lights at the rear.  The rear red lights were in two rows on top of each other which gave the appearance of a straight flat surface at the back of the craft.  The lights themselves looked like running lights (small, singular, but bright).  When the craft appeared sideways you could see much less white at the front and similarly red at the back with large dark gap (lack of any lights) at the sides.   Since it was night and the sky was clear yet dark, I could not discern any solid shape other than what you might think is shape determined by the configuration of the lights.  My window points south towards the lake whose shoreline is only 1 mile away.  Two craft were just west of my position (right) and were off shore heading inland (toward but just west of my house).  They were low on the horizon.  As they passed, I could not see an underside of the craft.   They were moving very slowly, (much slower than any small plane) and made no noise.  The third craft was some distance away to the far south east and much less visible but appeared to be just hovering (stationary).  Feeling awkward about what I had seen, I tried to go back asleep.  But the hum continued.   I could not fall back asleep and the hum seem to grow louder again.  So I got up and went to the window again.  This time, the aircraft were south and east of my house.  Their movement appeared to be along the shoreline, heading north, then south in a zig zag pattern heading from west to east. The distant craft was still stationary off to the south east. When I went to the back window I expected to see the craft continue further inland (north) and west (left) from my position. But I could see nothing.  Seems as though their flight pattern would zag, about where my house was as a distance from the lake, and they would head back south again. I went and got a pair of binoculars.  The configuration of the lights were clearer but I could still not determine the shape of the object.   Again, I felt a little silly with my wife sleeping beside me while I walk about the bedroom peering out of the windows, so I tried to go back asleep again.   The hum continued (never abated), and again got more intense, so I got out of bed again to have a look.  This continued for over 40 minutes.  I know because the hockey game was on (was falling asleep to it) and 2 periods had passed while this was happening.  Also, at one point the tv signal got scrambled for a brief moment which I thought was odd (not unlike everything else that was going on).   The objects continued eastward zigzagging north then south.  As they got more distant, I went back to bed and eventually fell asleep. The closes proximity I would say was practically over my house just to the east at a fairly low altitude 1500â€“2000 feet, but I could still not see any underside (nor lights).   The size would be that of a single engine 4 seat plane.  They made no noise.;43.4627371212121;-79.7225613636364
