We saw 8 craft 3 of which were on the ground and seemed to be damaged. We saw 2 small organisims which were light brown with oval shaped eyes. They were amitting a high picthed sound. When hearing it we blacked out and after we woke up we each had a large piece of skin taken out of our arms and we were bleeding profussly. Recently we have been having strange dreams about the expirence, in the dream we see them injecting fluids and needles into our ears. After the expirnce our wacthes were 4 hours behind.;43.4627371212121;-79.7225613636364

They seemed to be damaged. we saw 4 beings, light brown with large oval eyes, step out of the craft. they went and seemed to inspect the craft. Then, they turned around and saw us. I heard a high pitched piercing noise, then I blacked out. When I came to, everything was gone and I noticed several punctures in my skin. Recently I have had reoccuring dreams about the experiance. In my dreams I see those beings puting object that look like needles into me.;43.4627371212121;-79.7225613636364
Glad to have come across this site so I can recount what I and two other guys saw last year.;2005-07-18 09:34:00;About 5 Minutes;Glad to have come across this site so I can recount what I and two other guys saw last year.  I was at work and I stepped out for a cigarette and it was a beautiful blue cloudless sky.  I looked up to the sky and off in the northwest direction I could see a glimmering (looked like a sun reflection, rather than lights) and slow moving object in the sky.  It was very small from the distance away, so this object was very hard for me to determine any shape or relative size.  It moved so slowly and occasionally would ascend and descend rapidly at what seemed a thousand feet or so, but would then fall back into it's snail pace travel across the sky.  Two other guys came out or the building and noticed me looking up, so they inquired what I was looking at and I pointed it out.  One fellow grabbed onto the object immediately, while the other could not seem to fixate on it. Again..It was pretty high up and small.  Anyway...as we were looking up, we saw two orange and black chevron shaped objects fly across the sky into our felid of viewing from the west and turn into an eastern direction at a super rate of speed and a much lower elevation than the other object.  The two objects then made a sharp turn toward the west and did not separate or lose any ground to each other during this maneuver.  It was incredible to watch at the speed they were moving.  Total precision is the best way to describe it. Then they ascended to a little higher altitude and made another minor turn (again, perfect precision) and climbed and headed toward the first object that I originally spotted at the higher altitude.  These two black and orange chevron objects made zero noise that I or the other two could detect and we looked at each other stunned after and the looks on our faces related pretty much the same question...What Was That?  All three objects then vanished from our naked eyes, once the chevron objects appeared to re-unite with the first object.  Anyway..The duration from beginning to end was about 5 minutes..With the chevron objects event lasting only about 20 to 25 seconds of the total event.;43.4627371212121;-79.7225613636364
