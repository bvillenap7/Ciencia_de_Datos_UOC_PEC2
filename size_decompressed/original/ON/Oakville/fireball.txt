There was a fiery flash coming from the Northwest.;2005-12-08 00:30:00;10 Sec.;There was a fiery flash coming from the Northwest.  It was a fairly large, round object with a red exterior and white in the middle and left behind a orange trail. 3 smaller pieces broke off and burned up while the main piece continued across the sky with a descending trajectory.  An amazing sight to see.;43.4627371212121;-79.7225613636364
Fast bright object flies through semi-bright skies;2009-07-01 07:00:00;2 seconds;Fast bright object flies through semi-bright skies The summer break started not too long ago, and as usual we would hang out, outside. I was with my younger brother and my two neighbors talking about how the school year went and future plans.  While in out discussion, although it was still very bright out, I witnessed a fast streak of light behind some houses.  As soon as it passed, my brother and I freaked out yelling to everyone did you see that?!  It looked as though it was a meteor but it was way too bright to be one, and it was still bright outside.  My brother and I were staring straight at that direction while everyone else was backwards to it. I was lucky to see it, but I don't know what I saw really.  It had this glow to it as if staring into a bright light. I never reported this before, never thought of doing so, but now I am.;43.4627371212121;-79.7225613636364
two large balls of fire appearing in sky travelling east;2009-08-01 21:30:00;5 mins;two large balls of fire appearing in sky travelling east Two bright red fireballs appeared travelling east close to Upper Middle Road and Third Line, flying over the Abbey Park Recreation Center.  Very bright, like on fire, but looks like going east, not falling down, one after another about 3 mins apart, then disappearing.  Did not look like a meteor, looked like huge ball of fire, very red in colour. Not an airplane, perhaps space junk burning upon re-entry, but then why wouldn't the fireballs continue descent to the ground, why keep going east?  Silent, no engine sounds.;43.4627371212121;-79.7225613636364
6-7 orange fireballs seen over Oakville, ontario;2012-07-14 22:45:00;5 minutes;6-7 orange fireballs seen over Oakville, ontario Saw a bright orange/red fire ball in the sky.  Quickly joined by 2 other fireballs, within seconds we see another 4 fireballs joining in almost in procession to form a line that is equally spaced apart.It stays like that for a minute and then it changes to a W formation before the fireballs seem to vanish into thin air.  Completely freaked out and don't understand what we just saw.  The light that came from the balls was intensely bright and orange and they seemed to move from a northwest to southeast direction before vanishing.  Did not tell anybody initially because we did not think anybody would believe us without video proof but we know what we saw.

30+ slowly flying fireballs in the sky (second time witness);2012-07-24 17:30:00;10 minutes;30+ slowly flying fireballs in the sky (second time witness) I was in Saint Catharines about a month or two ago and saw red lights flying in the sky.  A whole pack of them. But they were very far away.  And now I saw the same thing in front of my house. There must have been 30-50 of them.  The flew from the right (West) to the left (East)  The second time they were Very close to me.  I had my digital camera, (as I am a photographer) and although zoomed right in, I could only see a red dot.  When the lights disappeared, it was a black object.  Not in any shape known. Not a sound heard. Airplanes do not fly in such a formation, and not in that area/direction.;43.4627371212121;-79.7225613636364
