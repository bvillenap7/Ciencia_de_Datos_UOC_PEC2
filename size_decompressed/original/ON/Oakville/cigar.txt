It was metaic silver coloured.  It looked much like an airliner fusilage flying in a manner much like a plane would.  It was silent.  It was flying S/W.  The whole sighting lasted approximately 45 seconds.  Did anyone else see it?  There were several distinct contrails in the sky all around it left earlier from passing jets.  The sky was blue and the weather was clear with just some high feather-like cirrus clouds.;43.4627371212121;-79.7225613636364
