sphere/disk shape craft hovering above us and let out smaller objects;2004-05-10 20:00:00;10-30 minutes;sphere/disk shape craft hovering above us and let out smaller objects It was 2004 sometime in mid-late April I was about 10 years old.  Our mother had just gotten home from the grocery store, which was about a 5-10 minute walk from our house she had left a bag at the store by accident and decided to send us kids (me, my sister, and two neighbor kids).  The sun was setting soon so it’s must have been around 8pm, after we got the bag and started heading back, we got to a side parking lot at the store when one of us said “what’s that?”, we all looked up to see a red and orangey light sitting right above us, and the silhouette of a circular object, we stood there in silence and stared up at this object for what I presume was at least 15 minutes, then all of the sudden to object started to let out smaller white lights that scattered all around the craft, the lights moved slowly around the craft in different directions, I don’t remember seeing the craft leave at all, I remember our mother being fairly worried because we had taken so long, and I realized we must have been watching the object for quite some time because it was completely dark out now. I hadn’t told anyone about the encounter for about 10 years, although I thought about the sighting every single day that went by, I finally mentioned it to my sister who was there, and she said in amazement that she absolutely remembered that, she was pretty shocked when I mentioned it her.  I don’t recall being terrified when seeing the craft, but more astonished and a deep emotional feeling involved, whether that was out of pure wow I’m not sure.;43.4627371212121;-79.7225613636364
