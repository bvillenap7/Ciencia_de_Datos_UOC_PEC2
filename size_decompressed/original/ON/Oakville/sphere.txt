Several bright orange globes speeding by approx. 10 degrees off the horizon  near Oakville, Ont;2012-09-30 18:45:00;30 seconds;Several bright orange globes speeding by approx. 10 degrees off the horizon  near Oakville, Ont At 6:45pm EST I was on my computer and paused to look out my kitchen window and saw 5 or 6 bright orange globes go flying by approx. 10 degrees off the horizon.  They were travelling much faster than a commercial airplane and were travelling at the exact same speed, some a few degrees higher than the other, but in a straight trajectory and parallel to the horizon.  I actually rubbed my eyes and kept staring in the same direction (due NE out over Lake Ontario between Oakville and Mississauga) waiting to see if more bright orange lights would appear.  After 30 seconds, another single light flew by and then that was it.  It was still daylight and the these orange lights were very bright - much brighter than a flare. For the record, this is the first time that I have witnessed any type of UFO and this event really shook me up, enough so that I have been searching the internet for the past few days to see if anyone else in the Oakville, Burlington, Mississauga ot! Toronto area also experienced what I saw that evening. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.4627371212121;-79.7225613636364
