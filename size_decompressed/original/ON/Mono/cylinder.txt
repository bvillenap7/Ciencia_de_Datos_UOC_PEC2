Blue glowing cylindrical object very low to the ground moving very slowly across the sky.;2000-01-04 05:51:00;10 minutes;Blue glowing cylindrical object very low to the ground moving very slowly across the sky. At 5:51 am in Mono Township, while brushing snow off my car, My attention was drawn to an object in the north-west sky. While I usually do not pay attention to aerial objects since we have a high amount of air-traffic in the area, I found myself mesmerized by this object because of it's peculiar color. Almost a neon type of glow, I can only say that it looked very similar to the type of glow given off by those new HID bluish headlights found on BMW's and Accura's. No strobe lights appeared on this object, as is commonly seen on aircraft. The object appeared to be silent and moving very slow to what appeared to be a westerly direction. I can only describe the shape as being almost half-circular with a bit of distortion. I took a digital photograph and although the image did not turn out too well it is still visible.
