Object first looked bright like a star it started flickering.  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??  PD))((anonymous source));2019-06-02 22:41:00;1+ hours;The object first looked bright like a star, as I continued watching it started flickering and appeared to be changing colour between white/red/blue.  After observing for roughly ten minutes another appeared.  They were the only two lighted things in the sky.  Thought it may be a plane but they did not move at all.  They would go very dim, then get very bright again and go between circular, diamond and a blob like shape. Observer backgrounds- my spouse and myself very average people.  When I first told my partner about the object they thought it was a star/plane.  As we continued to watch they agreed it was not and we had both never seen anything like it before.
