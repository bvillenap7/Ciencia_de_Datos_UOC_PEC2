rectangular shaped object with glowing lightblue lights at tree-top level while driving;2006-07-23 02:30:00;4 minutes;rectangular shaped object with glowing lightblue lights at tree-top level while driving Driving East at 2:30AM EST on Highway 7 in Frontenac County towards Ottawa, ON. at 60 miles per hour I noticed a light up ahead in the sky I couldn't explain as a street lamp or a star.   I was mesmerized when it started getting bigger and finally came to the left of my vehicule at tree-top level.  It seemed to be a square/rectangular shaped object of an incredible size (possibly 30 feet wide and 50 feet in height) with glowing lightblue lights apparent surrounding the object.   There were many sources on the object from which the light could be seen glowing.   I didn't stop driving but opened my window and it couldn't hear any mechanical sounds.  I had to look up ahead at times driving and even though I had the impression it was moving in the opposite direction everytime I looked outside to my left towards the object it was located at the same angle of vision.   I was driving back home from a wedding and had been listening to Charles Swindoll on the radio for a little while and the object appeared during Mr.Swindoll's final prayer.;44.8993;-76.2476999999999
