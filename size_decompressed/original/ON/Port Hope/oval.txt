Observed an Orange oval radiating object, originally small enough to look like a star or maybe Mars in the night sky.  The object began growing and radiating larger and appeared to come closer and lower to myself in my vehicle.  I observed other drivers look up at object and wonder what it was.  The object got smaller and then bigger hovering approximately 1000 feet over the 401, then took off in a northeast direction at a high rate of speed, getting smaller and disappered.  Only one object.;44.0171256410257;-78.4027666666667
