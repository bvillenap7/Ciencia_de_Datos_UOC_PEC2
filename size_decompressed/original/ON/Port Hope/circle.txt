Last night at approximately 11:15 pm, my friend and I were walking eastbound on Lakeshore Rd. in Port Hope, Ontario, when we both seen two soft white lights that were horizontal to each other moving north from over Lake Ontario.   They seemed to only be a km away when we first seen them, and the lower elevated light aligned completely horizontal under the other one, as the two of them began to travel east about 700-800 ft in the sky.  All throughout this time we had the opinion that this was one object, until two other lights began to follow the same path as the first two operating in the same manner. All four lights traveled quite slowly, about the speed of a slow plane however, once the second set of lights turned east, the first set traveled quite a bit quicker.  That was when we were certain that these were four different objects, because the upper light of the second set sped up as if it was attempting to keep up with the first set, and the lower light remained traveling at the same speed. After about eight to nine minutes of activity, the first two lights quickly disappeared, with the third light doing the same shortly after.   Eventually, the fourth light was out of sight as well. At no time was there any noise coming from the lights, and they kept the same height constantly. I attempted to record the action, but was not able to get the video since the street lights were much brighter yet, the audio gives our reaction to the sightings.;44.0171256410257;-78.4027666666667
