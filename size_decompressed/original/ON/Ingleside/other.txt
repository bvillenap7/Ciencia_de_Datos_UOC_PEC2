String of lights move silently across the night sky in a single file/straight tragectory.  ((NUFORC Note:  SpaceLink satellites. PD));2019-05-24 23:35:00;5 minutes;String of lights/stars move silently across the night sky in a single file/straight tragectory. This evening my wife and I happened to look up into the sky at 11:30 pm. I just returned home with my wife after picking her up from work. When we looked into the sky, we saw what appeared to be 50 or more stars moving in a single file from the west to the east.  The lights/stars were close in proximity and there seemed to be a few lights or stars that were quite always from the others but still aligned perfectly behind the other lights/stars. We could not see any shape it just looked like a string of lights going across the sky in a straight line. If you were to take your hands and put them 6 to 8 inches apart from the beginning to the end of the formation (I could not begin to explain how many miles that would be in comparison) that would be how long it was. My wife and I stood there watching the string of lights moving without the object making any sound. I do not know if anyone else has seen anything like this. Hopefully there is some kind of information about this. I am a skeptic. My wife is not but when I saw that this evening the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. I tried to get a video of the formation however when I thought I was video taping I forgot to press record. I wish I had pressed record!;44.9989;-75.0047
