triangle shaped craft with four coloured lights;2010-01-11 23:25:00;5 minutes;triangle shaped craft with four coloured lights On  January 11, 2010, at around 11:25 pm , myself and another passenger were driving west bound on 401 in eastern Ontario in the area of  Ingleside, when we spotted an unknown object in the sky. The object was south of where we were driving but it could be seen to be triangular in shape, it was stationary at that time with red, green, blue, and  amber lights, the blue and amber lights would flicker and change to alternating colours.  ((NUFORC Note:  We note that the description of the object is not entirely dissimilar to reports for the star, Sirius, which would be in the southern sky, at the time indicated.  Just a guess.
