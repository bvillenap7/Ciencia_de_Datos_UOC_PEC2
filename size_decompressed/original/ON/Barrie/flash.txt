Flying object makes a blinding flash then vanishes;2005-08-02 21:00:00;5 seconds;Flying object makes a blinding flash then vanishes While outside on a regular day with my friends I so happened to glance up to see a craft in the sky.  At first I thought it was a low flying plane.  That is until the object made a blinding flash and disappeared.  I wasn't very skeptical about crafts from other planets but now I am.  My friend didn't see much. He only saw a flash out of the corner of his eye.;44.3729949832777;-79.6880297658865
