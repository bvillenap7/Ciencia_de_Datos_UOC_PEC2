It was a light orange colour and I interupted his sentence to say check out the falling star. It was moving very fast as we both looked on but it changed direction and seemed to stop in the distance. It then moved slowly to the left and then came towards us at a high rate of speed and changed direction again and disappeared behind the roof of the house next door. We moved back to try and find the light again but it seemed to be gone. I have seen strange lights before but they had always turned out to be a plane or some kind of aircraft. But this was way too fast and an odd shape. It was pretty high up but I can't figure out what it was. I was very excited and still am and I will probably be up half the night to see if I can spot it again;44.3729949832777;-79.6880297658865
