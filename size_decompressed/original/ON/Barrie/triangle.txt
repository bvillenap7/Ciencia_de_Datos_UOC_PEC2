Black triangular shape with a red pulsating light underneath its center.;2014-08-09 21:45:00;30 seconds;Black triangular shape with a Red pulsating light underneath its center. At approx. 21:45 Sat the 9th of August 2014, I was looking out my rear patio doors, the doors face approx.  South.  I noticed an object in the sky, it had a pulsating Red light underneath it.   I called my wife over to the patio door and said look at thing in the sky pointing to it.  She responded, go get your binoculars.   So I ran upstairs got the binoculars and attempted to look at it, but the overhang of my house was preventing me from a clear view.   So I ran back downstairs and looked out the patio doors bracing the binocular against the glass, I could clearly see the Triangular shape of the object and the pulsating Red light underneath in it's center.   Looking out my patio doors the object was at the 10:00 O'clock Position.   The object moved slowly across the sky moving West.  At which point my wife tried calling my son over for a look when the object started to turn and face south then slowly started pitching its nose up and the Red pulsating light was no longer visible.  I turned to my wife to say take a look through the binoculars, when I turned back to look the object was no longer visible.;44.3729949832777;-79.6880297658865
