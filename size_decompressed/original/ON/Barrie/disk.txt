Flying disc spotted over Barrie Ontario;2020-01-30 18:30:00;1.5 hour;Flying disc spotted over Barrie Ontario At first glance I thought it was a plane.  It was very close and approximately the size of a large jet.  It was a disc shape with what appeared to be three large panel windows.  Bright lights inside that flashed on and off a couple times.  A light beam could be visible horizontal to the object.  The object would then “glide further away and then closer”   I watched this object (a duration of almost 1.5 hours) I called a friend to verify what I was witnessing. She lives in the next town.  I took a video as well.  Even at its closest it made ZERO sound  My dogs were going crazy!  Very strange ..;44.3729949832777;-79.6880297658865
