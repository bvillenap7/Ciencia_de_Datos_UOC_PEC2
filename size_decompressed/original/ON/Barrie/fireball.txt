Fireball In The Sky.;2002-04-12 16:30:00;1 minute;Fireball In The Sky. I was delivering papers on the first street (of my paper route.) When all the sudden out of the corner of my eye i saw something, I looked up and there was this fireball in the sky, it must have been big because it was far way but still bigger than a plane. At first it was moving straight across the sky, but then it looked like something inside of it exploded, and smoke started coming out of it and it plumetted down fast in a diagonal line like / with smoke trailing behind it. I'm not sure if anybody else really notced it because i wasn't paying attention to anything but it, as soon as it was out of sight, I ran home and told everyone i was close to. ((NUFORC Note:  A major bolide was observed over the eastern U. S. in July 2002.  Perhaps the witness is alluding to this event, and the date he recalls is not precise.  Just a guess on our part.
