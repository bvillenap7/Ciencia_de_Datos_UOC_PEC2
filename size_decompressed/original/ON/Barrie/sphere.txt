Then drops it self for 50 feet and then stops, then it shifted its position and fly side ways.  The object was green with a bright light surrounding it and a blue gas coming out from top and bottom. Two pictures are taken from the object.;44.3729949832777;-79.6880297658865
Fireball UFO over Barrie, Ontario.;2012-08-03 21:00:00;10 Minutes;Fireball UFO over Barrie Ontario There were two ufo's in total. Both ufo's were just like an orange ball of fire with rippling flames and only the first one seemed to have a smoke trail, as if it was really burning and hot.  They had about the average altitude of an airplane however it was moving pretty slow meaning this was not a comet we have seen those before...  The second one was seen travelling the same approximate path, altitude and speed a few minutes after the first ufo was out of sight.  They were moving from East to North West in direction.  Both of the ufo's would &quotturn off&quot meaning they went completely out no lights at all...  Then they would &quotturn&quot back on.  They made no sound at all and were very, very bright.   After the second ufo was out of sight an airplane was coming from what seemed to be the exact same location as the ufo's did and continued along the same path as the ufo's did, however the airplane did fly in a more Northern direction as opposed to a North West direction after a couple of minutes...

Bright orange spheres seen over the night sky in Barrie, Ontario, Canada;2012-08-18 22:15:00;3 minute (x2);Bright orange spheres seen over the night sky in Barrie, Ontario, Canada My wife and I were sitting in our outdoor spa enjoying the peaceful night.  We live in a wooded area outside the city of Barrie.  Weather conditions were very clear with no clouds and the sky was filled with stars. My wife noticed a large orange object rising up over the tree line.  The round object moved from west to east and passed at a moderate rate of speed.  The object took about 3 to 4 minutes to pass and seemed to take an irregular path just prior to disappearing. Then about 5 minutes later another orange sphere appeared from the same point of origin as the first one. It followed the same path until about the Â¾ point then veered off to the north east. We tried to explain it away as a helicopter or plane however there was no white, red or other coloured  lights for that matter just bright orange and constant.  There was also no sound associated with the object as it passed or afterward. August 18, 2012 at approximately 10:15pm;44.3729949832777;-79.6880297658865
5 bright red/orange (amber) lights hovering in the sky;2013-08-02 22:00:00;4 minutes;At approximately 10:00pm on Friday August 2, 2013 myself and 2 family members observed a total of 5 bright red/orange (amber) lights hovering in the sky in the South end of Barrie, Ontario.  When we first seen them, there were 3 hovering together in a triangle pattern travelling North, then they were travelling West together. 2 more appeared above the tree line, all following the same path they turned and travelled to the East. It was a clear night, lots of stars.  They were not aircraft, no blinking lights and no sound.  They were travelling at about the height a small aircraft may travel and even lower than that.  They would hover in one spot and also appeared to move slowly and then quickly.  All happened in approximately 4 minutes.  Very strange, never seen anything like it before.;44.3729949832777;-79.6880297658865

It appeared to come toward us and just hover for about 3 minutes before ascending upward very fast and fading until no longer seen. August 22,2013: We observed a very shiny light in the SE sky just before the sun set and during dusk. It moved toward us and we both thought it was a plane, however it just stopped moving and hovered for about 2 minutes before it moved vertically very fast and then to the left at about a 50 degree angle. We heard absolutely no noise.   It wasn't a plane, helicopter or one of those Chinese lanterns (we had seen the lanterns earlier this summer and they did not ascend very high let alone move very fast whatsoever).  We also knew it wasn't a satellite.  So, what was it?  This one appeared much closer than last night's object we saw. Initially, we thought it was a plane with it's landing lights on but very, very shiny.   I videotaped this object for about a minute, or so. Puzzling, to say the least. Has anyone else seen this in my area?;44.3729949832777;-79.6880297658865
