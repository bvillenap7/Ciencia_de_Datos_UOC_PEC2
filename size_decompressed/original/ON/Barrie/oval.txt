3 UFO's sighted in Barrie Ontario Canada and all had a stop and start movement.;2014-10-24 08:20:00;45 minutes;3 UFO's sighted in Barrie Ontario Canada and all had a stop and start movement I was walking my 12 year old daughter to school today, october 24, 2014, at 8:20 am.  A glint in the sky caught my eye. the sun was shining on it so it was pretty bright, metallic and it was sort of like d6 in this picture   http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6bVMndpzt5c/UXiyzdXObWI/AAAAAAAAOaY/atwoxfmGOjk/s320/UFO-shapes-chart-witnessed-anti-gravity.jpg   	It wasn't going fast, it wasn't super high in the sky (measuring with my fingures it seemed to be 1/4 to 1/2 an inch) for sure in the Troposphere, it wasn't leaving any trails as other planes flying around at the time were and there was no sound as they passed when a few other planes passed by i could hear them.   I knew it wasn't a normal plane because it kept stopping and starting in mid air and then it disappeared.  First sighting lasted a few minutes.  Second and third were about a minute.   Both my daughter and I were witness to this occurance. took a quick video but it is very blurry and shakey. 	I'm an average 36 year old female. warehouse worker.   Have seen one other ufo in ottawa 20 years ago.  My daughter is a normal 12 yo girl;44.3729949832777;-79.6880297658865
