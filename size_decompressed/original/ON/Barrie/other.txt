I have never seen anything like it before.;2003-11-07 18:30:00;45 seconds;I have never seen anything like it before. i decided to go for a walk on the city limits with my dog.  this was a secluded street with little houses around.  i came up to this open field and i notice my dog approaching this figure.  At first i did not know what it was until i got a closer look and i soon got this instant chill in where i was scared.  i said to myself what in the hell.  i looked at it and my dog did not bark.  This figure i had seen did not move it just stared at me. it was not alarmed that my dog was approaching it. I was very puzzled because i never seen anything like it before.  This figure was either lyin' down or on it elbows and knees.  There was no place for it to hide it must of tried to hide it appearance by not running or moving. i hope i never see it again.;44.3729949832777;-79.6880297658865
