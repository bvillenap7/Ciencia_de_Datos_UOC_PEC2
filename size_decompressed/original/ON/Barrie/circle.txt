Circular white/silver object appeared in flash of light, hid still in cloud, then in  flash of light disappeared.;2002-07-12 14:45:00;5 minutes;Circular white/silver object appeared in flash of light, hid still in cloud, then in  flash of light disappeared. Clear blue sky with few white clouds in sky.  Saw flash of light, then object appeared, it moved about erraticly then sat/hid on the edge of a cloud.  Could be seen in cloud very clearly but only once located.  Very clever of object to hide in dense white cloud. You had to know where it was to distinguish it.  Colour was such a pure white that it looked almost silver.  It had a perfectly circular shape.  It sat still in cloud for a few minutes and then disappeared in flash of light.  Moments later 2 jets flew right past the same location, it seemed too coincidental, almost like they were hunting for it.  Sighting was witnessed by one adult 32 yrs, 2 boys ages 11 and 8.  Hey, I need no further proof to be convinced, and hint of advice keep an eye out for discs hidding in clouds!!!;44.3729949832777;-79.6880297658865

Orange orbs in triangle formaton spotted slightly after 2012 new years countdown.;2012-01-01 00:15:00;2-3 minutes;Orange orbs in triangle formaton spotted slightly after 2012 new years countdown. While me and my friends were leaving the 2012 countdown downtown Barrie we made it about 5-10 minutes away when we had to urinate. Since there were no open public bathrooms around, we decided to go by a field off the side of the road. While urinating, i was staring at the sky when i noticed 3 glowing orange orbs in the sky.  I kept staring for a few seconds and noticed that they were moving about while staying in a triangle formation. The lead orb moved slighty farther ahead and than would slow for the others to 'catch up' as it seemed. After noticing what i was seeing, i pulled out my phone and took a 2 minute video which captured the orbs moving from one side of the horizon to the other (east - west) withing the 2 minutes.  I also managed to snap a picture of them to.;44.3729949832777;-79.6880297658865
Massive explosion over Northern Canada.;2016-03-04 01:30:00;60 seconds;Massive Explosion over Nothern Canada. The big explosion  It was the first Thursday of March 3rd, 2016, I believe, that I saw a major explosion.  First a major pure white flash, very white, then less than a second later, a secondary explosion that spewed green radiation outward to a larger ball.  I can't believe I'm the only one who saw this. It was about 20,000 ft. (Jet height, I figure) up over Northern Ontario.  I was in Barrie, Ontario, at the time.  I looked at the clock and it was 1:30 am.  This was definitely something blowing up. Here is a video I created to show what I saw. https://www.youtubecom/watch?v=ChhdkblGVvk ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other report from same witness for June 1st, 2014, Windsor, Canada, at 00:00 hrs..
