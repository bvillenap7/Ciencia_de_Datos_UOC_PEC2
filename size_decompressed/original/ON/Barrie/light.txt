I t was the brighest start looking object in the sky, and it was just sitting in the middle of the big dipper, and suddenly it started to move at a extreme speed.  We both stopped we were speeechless.  We watched it fly past starts i wondered if it was a plane or a satitlite but it was moving WAY to quickly, passing many stars.  then it stoped and i said to my friend either its moving further into space or coming towards us.  as were both pointing at it. But then the orange light began to dim and it flickered red. then back to orange it then went into blackness.  i know this is a ufo i know there are aliens, i know about grays and reptilians;44.3729949832777;-79.6880297658865
Bright lights on a sunny day, manouevering both horizontally and vertically over Barrie, Ontario;2011-05-09 12:00:00;20 minutes;Bright lights on a sunny day, manouevering both horizontally and vertically over Barrie, Ontario My son, mother in law and myself were driving north on highway 400 towards the town of Barrie, Ontario. It was a bright and sunny day with a few white puffy clouds.  To our left, in front of us (not sure how far away) we saw two bright lights moving vertically then horizontally across our range of vision.  They moved very fast and manouevered very easily.  They could be horizontal one second and 90 degrees vertical in another split second.  We watched two of these for quite a while, then another couple joined in the games.  The whole sighting lasted for about ten minutes.  We have it all on our cellphone video and my son described what we were seeing, but when you view the video, you can't see the lights (of course).  We reported this to my brother who is an OPP officer and he viewed the video.  He agreed that we must have seen something because of how excited my son was on the video.;44.3729949832777;-79.6880297658865

On February 24/ 2020 at 5:50Am I had just got in my hot tub and was looking at the stars.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-02-24 05:55:00;8 minutes;On February 24/ 2020 at 5:50Am I had just got in my hot tub and was looking at the stars.  I have seen satellites dozens of times.  But while looking up i noticed a line of stars moving.   I counted 9 lights (looked like satellites) in a direct line, equal distances apart moving in the exact same direction.  Like a formation following the exact same path at the exact same speed.  They were in a straight line spread out about half way across the sky heading south.  At the end of the line there was a single light traveling equal distances apart but at 90 degree to the line of nine. Once it was out of sight two more came in formation following the exact same path as the 9 earlier.  The last one slowly glowed very very bright then dimmed down to look like a satellite.  It did this several times as they followed the path of the other nine.  But definitely was in formation. It looked like this . .        .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Heading to the right&gt&gt&gt&gt&gt  I looked up on a satellite tracker and there was nothing like this formation.;44.3729949832777;-79.6880297658865
