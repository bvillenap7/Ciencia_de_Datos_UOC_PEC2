light off and on different speeds;2002-07-14 23:30:00;5 min;light off and on different speeds Myself, my son and his god-father witnessed what we at first thought was a helicopter come down with a search light then on an angle shot up and turned up the light.  It then shot back down although it was a bit higher than its originall position it again turned on the light.  The search light was unbeleivably bright.  There was no sound and it again turned out the light as it moved upwards slowly.  It then shot like a shooting star on an angle up out of sight.  Right after a plain seemed to follow the craft.;42.276970223325;-83.00375235732
A bright pulsating white light  near the moon....;2003-07-17 02:00:00;40 minutes;A bright pulsating white light  near the moon.... It was about 2.00 am I took my dog for a walk before going to bed. As I walked out of the building I looked up at the sky like I do every night. But this time I could clearly see something out of the ordinary... I looked around to see if there was anybody else seeing this but there was no one in the area. Even if it was a clear nigh I could not see any stars around the moon. Except for this very bright white light. I stood there starring at it for a few minutes before I noticed it seemed to be moving very slowly and was changing color from a white pulsating light to a bright orange then back to white. I ran back into my apartment to get my camcorder and digital camera... I took nine pictures but you can't really make out anything except a small white dots. But I managed to take about 40 minutes of video before my battery died. I had a hard time zooming in on it because of the moon being so close and so much brighter my auto focus kept zeroing in on it. After my battery died I stayed out there for awhile to see if anything else would happened. It just kept doing the same thing over and over. I then went back to my place to view the tape. I could clearly see on the tape the white light change to a bigger brighter orange light that seemed to pulsate for a few minutes then it went back to the white light and started the whole thing all over again.… ((NUFORC Note:  Probably Mars.

This is the second occurence in a week over my house.;2006-08-09 22:00:00;30 seconds;This is the second occurence in a week over my house.  It was about 45 degrees above the horizon in the east sky.  It looked like the size of a satellite, but moved much slower.  It had no flashing lights, but it had an intense white light coming from it.  Mostly the light was from the bottom, but it would be from the sides as well.  The stranger thing about tonight as opposed to last week was that the object was shinning an intense light downward when suddenly an airplane not very high in the sky was traveling towards it, heading east.  As the plane got further east, suddenly there was no light and the object disappeared, but before it did it flashed a bright light like a flash from a camera.  I see satellites all the time and can definately tell the difference between that and most jets.  This object tonight and last week seemed much slower then satellites.  There was definately no strobe lights of any colour coming from these objects.;42.276970223325;-83.00375235732
Saw an extremely small, black circular aircraft.;2018-05-26 21:00:00;1 minute;Saw an extremely small, black circular aircraft. At approximately 9pm,  I was sitting on my front porch staring up into the beautiful sky, pondering.  I saw a jet, and was staring at the jet, thinking of how miraculous it is us, humans, have created this ability to fly.  I’ve always been fascinated by aircraft, from the time I was a little girl. Not too far off in the distance I saw a bright reflection of another aircraft.  I immediately thought this was just another jet however, the reflection ceased and I was then able to see the aircraft itself and it did not resemble anything I recognized.  It was an extremely small black circular shaped.  It was travelling east at a steady, uniform speed. I was confused, but not alarmed, as I thought maybe this is just an extremely high jet, or even a small personal airplane.  But as I stared more intensely at it, I clearly saw it was just a black circle, no wings. I then looked at another jet off in the distance, to compare to the size of this unusual craft, and yes, I confirmed to myself that what I was looking at was indeed unusually small.  It was so small, I had trouble finding it again. At this point, the path was going to go over my house, so I stepped down my porch stairs to get a better view, but I could no longer find it.  I believe this is due to one of two reasons 1) It was so small I simply couldn’t find it or 2) It flew off.;42.276970223325;-83.00375235732
