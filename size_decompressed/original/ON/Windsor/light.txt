Four balls of red light dashed across the sky from the south, stopped, then made right angled turns to the east.;2004-06-20 00:15:00;15 seconds;Four balls of red light dashed across the sky from the south, stopped, then made right angled turns to the east. I was star-gazing with my boyfriend in his back yard -- I'm a pharmacy tech and he's currenty changing careers from computers to truck driving. It was a very clear night and a lot of stars were visible. Just before our u.f.o. sighting we saw what my boyfirend says were satelites moving across the sky. I also saw a shooting star (only one) in between our satelite viewings. We were starring in the section of the sky where the Northern Cross lies when all of a sudden four balls of red light dashed across the sky in front of us. I saw four lights, my boyfriend saw three -- the fourth was somewhat behind the others and farther up in the sky). The objects came from the south and were spred across the sky, they were not flying close together. They dashed in front of us, then slowed down to a stop before they darted off in a right angled turn towards the east and disappeared. I started laughing when they came to a stop because all I could think of was Oh my God, they are flying in military V formation!! Well..it wasn't a complete V shape but it was close. It might sound strange, but the lights seemed to me to be....translucent.;42.276970223325;-83.00375235732
A light brighter than Jupiter started moving across the sky.;2006-05-22 23:45:00;2 mins;A light brighter than Jupiter started moving across the sky.  Went out to check how clear the sky was.  Looked up saw an object brighter than Jupiter in a position that was not where Jupiter was.  I thought to myself,  whats jupiter doing over there? Then I looked and saw Jupiter was still over where it was supposed to be,  looked back at the object.  It was bright white,  and it started to move slowly,  picked up speed.  It moved across the horizon from south to northwest. Went and got my binoculars.  Typically we get a lot of air traffic being near the Riverside Descent Area to Detroit Metro Airport.  But I was able to see other planes at extremely high altitudes.  Planes typically have flashing lights, and red/green lights on the wingtips.  I looked at the object with my binoculars.  No flashing lights at all.  Just a bright pure white light.   My wife saw another object moving in the opposite direction and had been looking at that.  Then after the 2nd object had moved across the sky in the exact same trafjectory but opposite direction, we picked up another 3rd object moving the exact same direction as the first.  The object was not a plane with its landing lights (another typical phenomenon I've seen in this area for 30 years) because it was almost at the zenith and it was moving.  It was not a satellite, as it was moving much too slow.  Plus it had started off stationary, like just a star in the sky,  then it started to move off.  Eventually the object did lose its brightness and fade away.  I have seen satellites get bright and then fade away but the speed never changed.  this was stationary for a bit before it moved off. ((NUFORC Note:  The International Space Station was not visible from Windsor, Ontario, on May 22nd, 2006.  We presume that the witness implies a nighttime sighting, and we have amended the time to reflect that fact.  PD));42.276970223325;-83.00375235732
White light splits in two and fly in opposite directions.;2013-06-12 20:00:00;5 minutes;White light splits in two and fly in opposite directions. I was smoking a cigarette on my balcony I thought it was a star but it started to move and then broke into two.  They then went in opposite directions.  One went left and sort of curved and came directly over my apartment.  It was a white circle of light.  I could not see any other details.  I take care of my elderly father after he broke his hip,he saw the lights to.  He has also seen them on other occasions.  We both seen them one more time it was only one but it stopped dead stayed there for awhile the just blinked out.  It was gone just gone and never came back.  My cats seemed scared.  They where real jumpy I could not even pet them for a couple hours.  Never has this happened before or since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

5 orange lights seen in sky over windsor.;2013-10-11 22:18:00;3-5 minutes;5 orange lights seen in sky over windsor As I was driving I looked up into the sky and saw five orange lights hovering in the sky , two of them moved upward and downward, they looked like they werenâ€™t very far, they all stayed together in one formation, I saw them on the south western part of the sky , it was a clear night , they were not stars, cause they looked like close objects and were moving all together while two of them like I mentioned before moved up and down , and they had orange fiery color .  Also , I saw a low flying aero plane that looked like it was circling the objects , this lasted as long as maybe 5 minutes estimate , as I was driving I tried to keep my eyes on them , and then they suddenly disappeared.;42.276970223325;-83.00375235732
Dozens of white lights moving across the sky slowly and in the same direction.;2014-01-27 06:30:00;few minutes, i jumped on ;Dozens of white lights moving across the sky slowly and in the same direction. It was still dark out when I went to catch my bus to go to school early.  As I was waiting at the bus stop, I looked up and noticed a small white light that was moving.  I thought it was a star or that the movement of the wind/clouds was making it appear that the star was moving.   So I looked around and noticed that there were dozens of these lights all moving in the same direction.  At least one light was further up in the sky and appeared smaller yet it kept up the same slow speed as all the other white lights that were stretched across the sky.   All the lights were moving in the same direction and at the same slow speed.   It was really weird.;42.276970223325;-83.00375235732
Red/orange light over Detroit.;2017-07-15 23:10:00;20-30 seconds;Red/orange light over Detroit. After taking sunset pics from Windsor side of Detroit River, looking toward Detroit, the sky was darkening, when I noticed a small bright red/orange light coming from the north below high clouds over Detroit.  I thought at first it was likely a plane or helicopter, but it was a single, unblinking light.  I thought it may be a Chinese lantern, as I 'd seen several launched in the same area a year ago, but it wasn't a flame creating the light.   When I realized it had no easy explanation, I reached for my camera phone and quickly set it to the highest 4x magnification and tried to get a video, but full magnification didn't pick it up and while I was attempting to find it on screen, it disappeared. It was a slow, steady moving light that came from the north (moderate winds from the west) that without changing speed, abruptly changed direction 3 times before it disappeared.  It kind of resembled the speed of a satellite, but was a small, but bright unchanging red/orange light that flew under the high clouds.   Thought it might have been a drone, but it seemed to be a mile or more high and I didn't think drones flew that high.;42.276970223325;-83.00375235732
Bright lights in the sky.  ((anonymous report));2018-04-12 21:45:00;3 minutes;Bright lights in the sky. Seen bright white light flashing 5-6 times, very bright twice, very slow and dim the other times.  Way higher than any planes flying in the area and not moving in any direction.   There were about 6 passenger planes in the sky and they had to also have seen the light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
