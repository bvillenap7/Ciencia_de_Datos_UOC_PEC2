Green light moves at high speed across the sky.;1999-11-29 01:40:00;3 seconds;Green light moves at high speed across the sky. While driving West on the EC Row highway (in Windsor), between 1:40 am and 1:50 am, we spotted a bright green light above the highway. Me and my friend both exclaimed WOW, and saw the light move from about 80 degrees to about 30 degrees in less than 2 seconds, Westwards. It is the fastest moving object we have seen, and we do not believe that it was a rocket. We also exclude it from being a falling star (green color).;42.276970223325;-83.00375235732
shooting stars? space junk? MIRVs? What was that UFO? ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of re-entering space debris.  PD));2004-06-26 23:00:00;30 seconds;shooting stars? space junk? MIRVs? What was that UFO? I was outside with my father enjoying our bonfire, when I noticed in  a clear sky, an object I first thought was a shooting star travelling at a high speed.  I pointed it out, and noticed 4 other objects.  The objects were at a very high altitude, they were north of us, probably above Pontiac Michigan, travelling east.  Within approximatly 30 seconds, they had travelled from my first sighting, on a west-east track and out of sight.  Approximatly 40 to 60 nm in distance.  The objects were in a formation with 2 objects above and to the left of 2 other objects  with one object in the centre, but at a lower altitude.  The lower object was the brightest and most defined.  They looked like a shooting star, with a defined, and bright white tail.  However, unlike a shooting star they didn't burn out, and were at an amazing speed.  No sound at all was apparant.  For these objects to cover this distance in this time period, they would have to be travelling in excess of Mach 7.  I have a high knowlege of aviation, and this defies any conventional explanation except for: space junk re-entering the atmosphere, MIRVs, but it is definatly a UFO.;42.276970223325;-83.00375235732

It slowly zig-zagged left and right a few times in its southerly travel then it stopped and slowly began to get smaller in size until it dissapeared as it seemed to increase its altitude.;42.276970223325;-83.00375235732
