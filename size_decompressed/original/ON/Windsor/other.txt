5 slow moving objects near detroit/windsor;2002-10-14 18:05:00;10 minutes;5 slow moving objects near detroit/windsor 3 university students in a car coming back to windsor.  In between windsor and chatham, we noticed 5 shapes in the sky.  They looked like planes with trails, except they were moving very slowly and in seemingly random directions. this lasted 10 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness was kind enough to forward several photos to NUFORC.  The objects look like contrails in a clear sky, illuminated by the setting Sun.  We have little doubt but what that is the explanation for the objects.  PD));42.276970223325;-83.00375235732
small, unusual fat kayak flying vehicle/object in the sky (photographed);2011-03-24 17:00:00;less than one minute;small, unusual fat kayak flying vehicle/object in the sky (photographed) On Thursday March 24, 2011 I was taking photographs from my apartment balcony, looking west from downtown Windsor, Ontario.  I noticed a small dark object in the sky and it was moving above the Ambassador Bridge.  So with my camera I captured the image of the craft, along with the bridge, for reference purposes.  The photograph showed what appeared to be a 'disc-like' object, but when I zoomed in on it, the object was not a disc, but rather something that looked almost like a fat kayak, navy blue in colour, with one end of the object appearing rounded and of a shiny, light toned silvery metallic material.  From the top of this chubby kayak appears a light, rounded object. (Since the latter part of 2009, I have taken well over one hundred photographs of unusual/unidentified flying objects - a very wide variety of shapes and sizes - from this location where I live in Windsor), along with numerous pictures of EBEs (extraterrestrial biological entities, most, but not all, of them, humanoid in appearance.)  This is the first time I have reported one of my sightings - but if I was to go back and report every single one of them, they would number 100+. Happy Skywatching, friends..!;42.276970223325;-83.00375235732
Try to explain this traveler.;2014-06-01 00:00:00;3 minutes;Try to explain this traveler. The next video was a few years back, maybe three, but nobody wants to see a home made video.  Anyway, we watch for travelers all the time when its really dark here in Windsor, Ontario.  They are up there every night, you just have to look very far up.  We've seen two following each other even.  But this one was so close we thought it was closer than the stars. The video is very close to what we saw but maybe a bit big in comparison.  I will guarantee that if you sit out there long enough you will see at least one traveler in a dark sky.
