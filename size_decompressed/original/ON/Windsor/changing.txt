Yesterday June 16/13 I saw an object in the sky, it looked about 350 ft in the air.  Flew directly over head in one direction toward Lake St Clair Northbound with out any sound. I got a very good look at it.  It was like a multi-Triangular rectangle, it rolled in an orbit as it floated across the sky.  It was blueish purples and reds and greens reflecting on these multi triangle panels and strange lights on what looked like a panel. I was the size of a small car.  It looked like it was changing shape but not so, it was due to it rolling like it was.  It was like multiple triangles put together forming an odd looking rectangle.  It lasted too short of a time and I had my camera packed away...while riding my bike through the nature trail.  Just my luckâ€¦ But I know what I saw.;42.276970223325;-83.00375235732
