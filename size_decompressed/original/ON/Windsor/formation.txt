They seemed to come out of the middle of the sky in groups of 2, 3, 4 (it varied).  All were going at a fast rate of speed.  All we could see were the lights.  They weren't planes because there were planes in the sky and the planes were not travellling as fast.  All the other (besides the 1st 3 went in the exact same direction - only this time southwest.  The night was very clear.  I am 50 my friend 59. We are very level-headed people.  We were sitting on my friend's  deck observing what a nice night it was and watching the stars and the planes.  In all we saw at least 30 of them, all going at the same rate of speed.  All with lights resembling stars only bigger.  The lights looked like they were in a row beside each other whenw there were 2, 3 or 4.  When there were 7, it was 1,2,2,2.  I am a small business owner  my friend is a foreman.there was nothing reported the next day.  At aproximately 1145 we stopped watching.  These were not planes and not birds.  Other people must have witnessed this if they were looking at the stars- there wasn't a cloud in the sky.;42.276970223325;-83.00375235732
Three white lights fly north over Detroit, followed minutes later by a lighted Chevron object.;2007-04-29 21:39:00;3 seconds;Three white lights fly north over Detroit, followed minutes later by a lighted Chevron object. I was  looking up  at the sky eastwards at 21:39 April 29/07 observing an eastbound jet. My attention was drawn to a passing streak over head  travelling north over the river and over Detroit. Inside this streak or slipstream trail was three close white lights travelling a straight line north very quickly,  unlike any commercial airtraffic or falling star/meteor. I observed this for three seconds. I was so excited by this unusal appearance. I waited around to see if I'd see more. After awhile, I decided to go into my house for pen & paper to sketch the stars and the  objects  direction. Again my attention was drawn in the same general area of the sky. Looking up at 21:58 I observed a second sighting. This time what I saw was slightly lower in the sky but entirely different. What I saw clearly but briefly for approx. 2.5- 3 seconds was a chevron-shaped object with 7 white lights underneath . This object was dim, and about the size of a dime held at arm's length. This object travelled in the same direction as the previous one I saw.;42.276970223325;-83.00375235732
