ASSUME IT WAS A TRIANGULAR SHAPED VEHICLE AS THE LIGHTS TRAVELLED IN PERFECT UNISON WITH ONE LIGHT AT THE LEAD POS'N AND TWO LIGHTS FLANKING IT BUT LOCATED BEHIND IT.  SKY WAS DARK AND NO STARS VISIBLE THRU THE AREA WITHIN THE THREE LIGHTS. THIS REPORT IS SUBMITTED BY A SECOND INDIVIDUAL, AS THE PERSON WHO ACTUALLY WITNESSED THE LIGHTS DID NOT WISH TO DO SO HIMSELF. HE FEARS RIDICULE AND HAS NOT EVEN TOLD HIS WIFE ABOUT IT.  HE ONLY TOLD THE WRITER ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE WRITER IS A LISTENER OF THE ART BELL PROGRAM.  HE APPEARED QUITE SINCERE AND ABOUT, AND DISTURBED BY THE EVENT. I HAVE KNOWN HIM FOR APPROX. 3 YEARS AND HE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A PERSON PRONE TO FLIGHTS OF FANCY. I HAVEN'T HEARD OF MANY REPORTS OF THIS NATURE FROM THIS AREA AND THOUGHT EVEN AN INDIRECT ACCOUNT OF THIS TYPE OF EVENT FROM THIS AREA MIGHT BE WORTHY OF NOTE. N.B.  AS THIS OCCURRANCE WAS NOT WITNESSED BY THE WRITER, AND THE ACTUAL WITNESS DOES NOT WISH TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY ATTEMPT TO PURSUE FURTHER INFO REGARDING HIS OBSERVATIONS, I DO NOT FEEL IT SERVES ANY PURPOSE TO PROVIDE CONTACT INFO, AND WILL THEREFORE FEFRAIN FROM DOING SO.

Black triangle glides in Windsor.;2010-11-01 20:30:00;3 minutes;Black triangle glides in Windsor. I was sitting in my car waiting for my boyfriend, since I was a little girl I've been fascinated with the moon and stars so I'm always looking up. Well I was and I could hear a faint gliding sound so continued to look. The sound got closer and what I seen was a big all black triangle moving very slowly just above a tall tree about forty feet just to the side of my car. It was moving so slow I could count the lights. Two sides had exactly five light and it also seemed to have a slight fog following it. I couldn't see anything but underneath because it was an unusually very dark night sky. I hung out my car window to follow it. It was so close to me I thought of grabbing a rock and throwing it, I could've hit it. A man was coming out of the building literally as this was happening and he had no clue it was above his head. I decided to jump out of the car to continue to watch it and started running towards the man, shouting look up. He looked at me like I was n! uts. Finally he looked up and I looked up and it was gone. No more light just gone. My boyfriend came a minute later and I was freaking out. We sped home, I called the police, they thought I had been, drinking or on drugs. I was furious and baffled that they didn't take me serious. I hung up the phone and jumped in the car with my family and drove in the direction the craft went. It was headed towards our local airport so I drove in that direction, thinking it could be military. I never did see anything more. I still talk to family and friends about this incident. Some believe me and some think I'm nuts. But I know what I seen and no one will ever take that from me!;42.276970223325;-83.00375235732
