Lottery win;1987-09-22 23:00:00;60 minutes;Lottery win Initially glowing ball of light it would get really bright and then really dim as we are driving down the road towards it on a very familiar Country road. As we approach the light it started moving towards us and went right over the car.  In shock for a moment it seem like then we started chasing it eventually it broke into several lights making very strange movements.  Eventually we lost sight of it as we were driving. Driving back home my brother and I I couldn’t help but think it must be military or something not sure exactly what I witnessed this is where things get a little strange.  In my head I thought to myself if I witness what I think I witnessed they must be able to read my mind or something I started trying to communicate with them asking them to reappear  just outside of our house as we were parking the car a pretty big UFO was right above us for maybe 10 15 seconds pit up and shot away in an instant with no sound maybe a bit of a breeze sound I remember  My brother and I both walk into the house loudly not really speaking to each other he went to his room I went to mine I started looking out the window into the sky not seeing anything perfectly normal night at this point.  Unable to sleep I walk to the convenient store nearby grab some snacks walking back thinking to myself that was pretty crazy stuff if they can still read my mind I would like to win the lottery I’m 17 years old at the time not legally allowed to win.  Went back home the next morning my brother still very excited about what it happened the night before decided to call the military to find out if any training exercise  happening in our area.  That didn’t go very far  End of story  until I was 18 and I ended up winning the lottery 6/49 jackpot over $1 million out of the very  convenience stores I went to that night.  One other incident since then 67 years later bright light shoots into a cloud at night very fast speed does not come out the other side of the cloud that’s it;43.5141999999998;-79.8846592417062
