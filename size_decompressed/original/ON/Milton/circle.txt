Bright glowing object;1998-12-11 23:00:00;3-4 sec;Bright glowing object My friend and I were about to enter a buliding when I looked up to the evening sky (overcast in areas,) and notice a bright light move VERY fast across the sky (heading north-west.)  We then notice something shooting from it, in a downward direction.  Then both objects disapeared shorty after.  I feel that the object was a metoerite but I cannot be certain, I have never seen one so bright before (both objects.)  I thought I would mention it for what it's worth. Later....;43.5141999999998;-79.8846592417062
Large white circular light,Approaching the south,of milton ontario,object veered very quickly to the east.;2013-11-19 07:50:00;10 seconds;Large white circular light,Approaching the south,of milton ontario,object veered very quickly to the east. At approx,7:50 am,I was looking out my back patio door which looks out to the north,  At approx.1000-2000ft in elevation (cloud ceiling was very low yesterday morning, as we had alot of wind, rain that nite,  So the clouds were very low.  Above the townhouse complex roof i saw in the distance (which i guess would be possibly over highway 401, area)  Which i saw a very large white light, looked perfectly round,  It was moving towards the south,then it very quickly turned to the east, nothing like a plane, helicopter, etc.  I did not observe any noise,  It turned very sharply,  As it turned i could not follow it as the townhouse complex and trees, were obstructing any possibly of viewing it.  (Moved Very very quick. Thank You;43.5141999999998;-79.8846592417062
1 bright orange orb moving strange south of Milton, Ontario, Canada.;2014-05-17 22:00:00;10 minutes;1 bright orange orb moving strange south of Milton, Ontario, Canada Driving to the store with my mother and we see a bright orange orb moving very strangely just above the horizon.  It changed direction very fast from East to West and seemed to be getting closer and farther to our vehicle.  Stopped the car and got out, and the orb proceeded to go south faster than anything I have ever seen until it was gone in about 1 second.  There were starting to go off but this orb was way higher up and farther away in a different direction.  The way it moved made absolutely no sense it would switch direction instantly. I don't think I will ever forget what I just saw.;43.5141999999998;-79.8846592417062
Donut-shaped ufo in sky along with another object.;2014-06-03 20:30:00;10 minutes;Donut shaped ufo in sky along with another object. While driving down the street we noticed 2 black objects in the sky.  At first wr thought they were 2 groups of balloons as if someone let them go into the sky.   After seeing them closer, we thought maybe they were remote controlled of some sort, then as they were flying closer we noticed 1 was in the shape of a donut (black) with a hole in the Center of it (almost as if an oversized black inner tube from a pool was in the sky but bigger) and the other craft we couldn't make out the shape.  All we could see is it didn't appear to have wings, just flashing lights. We followed it as we could,  and even got video of it on my phone.  While watching the video back, you can see them in the sky, but since it's on a phone, it's not as clear as what we saw with the naked eye.  I'll have to find a program on the computer or something to try and make the video clearer so the donut shape can be seen. These 2 objects flew close enough to each other the whole duration of the sighting (10 mins give or take).  Eventually we lost sight of them as we kept getting stuck at lights and stop signs. We then searched on Google 'donut shaped ufo' sure enough a lot of info came up in regards to numerous sightings of this shape and that they're becoming more prevalent around the world.   1 image we saw on Google looked exactly like the black donut shape we saw in the sky, literally a carbon copy.  Really has us thinking. ..... What did we see?;43.5141999999998;-79.8846592417062
