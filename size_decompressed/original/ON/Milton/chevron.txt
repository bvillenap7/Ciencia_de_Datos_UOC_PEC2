I was looking up at the stars in a westerly direction when movement caught my eye. A chevron or V shaped object moving from south to north silently passed overhead.  It looked like a ghost as the inside was clear.  There were several lights, maybe 6 on the outside edges of the wings that were a very dull yellow colour.  The lights were a rectangle shape.;43.5141999999998;-79.8846592417062
