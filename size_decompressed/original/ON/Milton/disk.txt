There;2003-12-09 06:40:00;3min;I was driving to work in the early hours of the morning. The street I drive on Bronte st. has very little lights in areas of it. There is also a known air travel for planes. But I looked up and this plane was not a plane it had no blinking coloured lights. And it looked somewhat like a fat plane sideways but much much bigger, with 3 bright lights. How it moved had me staring at it, I almost pulled over. It was slow and just hovering, waiting. It would go up and then down, and then after a few minutes I seen to other objects in the morning sky. These were planes Jets, heading towards it at opposite sides. The UFO, quickly just disappeared leaving the two jets just to cross eachother. I felt as if I was crazy, I just seen a UFO, and two jets trying to get to it. Wow. I am still in awe at what I seen. At least now I know. NO matter who tells me that can be easily explained, honestly that one can not be, this was way too huge, too high and too low in the sky and far to quick.
