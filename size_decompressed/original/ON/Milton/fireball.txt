Massive Bright Orange Fireball in Sky;2013-09-09 21:00:00;3 minutes;Massive Bright Orange Fireball in Sky My husband and I were sitting on our porch last night around 9pm when we witnessed a massive bright orange fire ball flying towards our house.  We watched it as it turned North and flew for another 2.5 minutes.  It was approximately 75-100 feet above the houses.  It was flying slow.  We also noticed our neighbour across the street observing it.  We were all stunned.  My husband snapped a photo with his phone.  Wish he'd thought of it sooner because it didn't turn out too well.  This was definitely NOT a meteor, Chinese lantern or anything of that sort.;43.5141999999998;-79.8846592417062
3 reddish/orange Lights flying over Milton, Ontario on June 14 at 11:15 pm (Amazing Sighting);2014-06-14 23:15:00;6 minutes;3 reddish/orange Lights flying over Milton, Ontario, on June 14 at 11:15 pm (Amazing Sighting) At approximately 11:15 pm on Saturday, June 14, 2014.  I was on my way out to the store with my daughter and noticed 3 very large bright orange/reddish lights in a triangular shape in the sky, it was located Milton north area.  It was moving rapidly going south into Milton.   One of the bright lights disappeared right before our eyes,it was a bit scary to see it vanished.  There weren't any sounds coming from these objects, so we knew if was not 3 planes or 3 helicopters.  They were flying lower than the typical air plane.   It was very shocking to see this because I don't believe in UFOs, but this sighting was REAL!  I can't stop talking about it because I have never experienced this before.  If anyone out there had the same experience in Milton on this day, please share it...   I also have a video of it if anyone would like to see it.;43.5141999999998;-79.8846592417062
Two bright orange balls of light blinking in and out of visibility at intermittent times over the span of an hour;2021-08-26 22:25:00;40 minutes;Two bright orange balls of light blinking in and out of visibility at intermittent times over the span of an hour Witnessed two bright orange lights, in the southwest sky above the Milton/Oakville region. Both myself, my husband, as well as our two young children witnessed this. Initially it was one light, but another became visible and occasionally one or the other would go dark and seem to disappear. At some point they were being circled by helicopters. We have video footage as well as pics.;43.5141999999998;-79.8846592417062
