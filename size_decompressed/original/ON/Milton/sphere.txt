Green Glowing Sphere of light.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));2006-04-04 22:30:00;3 sec;Green Glowing Sphere of light Driving home from work on the Highway 401 near Milton I saw a sphere of glowing green light travel down at a 45 degree angle and dissapear.  It was quite large in size and I am sure other motorists must have seen it. There were lots of stars in the sky and this was not anything like it.  I looked like a ball of energy.   Has anyone else seen this sort of thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));43.5141999999998;-79.8846592417062
A greenish whitish sphere crossed low on the horizon just as a plane was flying over it.;2013-07-12 21:50:00;3 seconds;A greenish whitish sphere crossed low on the horizon just as a plane was flying over it.   First my son saw it and as i turned i saw it as well.   It was moving very fast and at first my son thought it was a meteorite but I don't think it could have been because there was nothing trailing it.   It appeared to be low to the ground (maybe 1000 to 5000 feet) and an airplane was flying over it maybe at about 10,000 feet.;43.5141999999998;-79.8846592417062
