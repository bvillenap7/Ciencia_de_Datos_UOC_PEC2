Ball flying across sky in Sarnia.;2014-09-01 18:25:00;20 seconds;Ball flying across sky in Sarnia. My wife and I were both outside on our patio, watching an approaching storm that was fast approaching from the west.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a round object moving across the sky no higher than 75 to a 100 feet up.  It was dark in color, made no sound , and it was not a balloon.  It moved in a straight line, in a south to north direction.  With the the strong winds blowing in from the west and switching to the east, there was no way this was a balloon floating across the sky.  It kept the the same speed, height, and just went straight across the sky.   I have been in the Military and am quite familiar with my aircraft.  I can honestly say I have never seen this kind of craft before.;42.9820066225167;-82.3419920529802
