Fireball like object ascending then turned abruptly and hesitates during flight path.;2013-06-01 21:29:00;90 seconds;Fireball like object ascending then turned abruptly and hesitates during flight path My husband (ex-military) and I were outside on our back porch when he said to me “check out that light”. I looked in the direction he was pointing which was the Southeast. I saw a fireball like object rising upwards in the distance. Unsure how far the distance was, compare it to the size of a baseball visually. One object. Yellow-orange in color. Fireball shape.  Could clearly see it under the cloud cover in the nighttime sky at 9:29pm  (21:29).  I told my husband to check what time it was just after the object turned abruptly.  It was quick in movement headed in a straight line towards the North.  During its flight path we noticed it would hesitate, like it paused then would continue on the straight path.  This happened two times.  No trails, no streaks behind it.  Then it disappeared.  Maybe the cloud cover obstructed our view.  No sound was heard and it was a quiet night.  Not a flare.  Not a star.  Not a plane.  Not a helicopter. //end;42.9820066225167;-82.3419920529802
Swarm of 20-25 fireballs over Sarnia, Ontario.;2014-02-05 20:00:00;45-60 seconds;Swarm of 20-25 fireballs over Sarnia, Ontario. Mr. Davenport,  I heard you on C2C Friday night, and you mentioned the Milwaukee video, and you said you were uncertain as to the possibility that they were birds, so I was compelled to write you with my sighting of the same objects.  I live in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, and on Wednesday, Feb. 5, 2014, I witnessed the identical objects as in the aforementioned video. It was approximately 8pm after a large snowstorm, I was in the driveway shoveling when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye (north of my location), and was stunned by what I was looking at.  There was a swarm of bright lights circling, as if they were in a large tornado.  The objects were balls of amber/orange light with fairly long trails of sparks following them.  They moved identically to the objects in the video.  The objects were quite close to my location (approx. 1/2 a mile away), and the sky around the objects had a very pronounced white/orange glow to it. My first thought was fire works, but I heard no bang and the lights did not burn out.  I was able to focus on one object and follow it, and I can say with complete certainty that they were not birds, drones or paratroopers.  They were very bright, self luminous balls of light (like a ball of fire) moving quickly in every direction, but in the same swarm pattern.  I watched the objects for approximately 45 seconds to 1 minute, before running to the front door to tell my mother (who lived in the upstairs apartment at the time) to look out back.  It took  a couple of minutes to get her attention and by the time I was able to look again they were completely gone and the sky had returned to regular darkness, without the glow. This all took place over downtown Sarnia, and there was about 30% cloud cover, so I can say with certainty that they were all below cloud level.  Also, there were no unusual sounds, or airplanes overhead, as I was watching the objects.;42.9820066225167;-82.3419920529802
