3 bright lights crossing the sky very fast in Sarnia;2002-08-30 22:18:00;30 sec. to 1 min.;3 bright lights crossing the sky very fast in Sarnia My sister-in-law and myself were sitting in my back yard with a cup of coffee, chatting, when she yelled and pointed to the shy above my head. look at these lights There was 3 ligths that were crossing the sky very fast! They were definitly not planes because of their speed and the way they were acting. They were flying and they regrouped and they seperated themselves again to finally disapearing in the horizon. They were very bright. When I went to work the next day, other people from my area saw them too.;42.9820066225167;-82.3419920529802
Aug 20, 2011 22:00 hrs. 9 bright orange lights moving N over MI.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from person familiar with investigation.  PD));2011-08-20 22:00:00;14 minutes;Aug 20, 2011 22:00 hrs. 9 bright orange lights moving N over Michigan. At approximately 22:00 hrs on August 20, 2011, while I was outside in my drive way having a cigarette, I happened to look north across the school field and I saw 3 bright orange lights cresting the horizon, NNE of my location.  I could not believe what I was seeing so I ran onto my deck and up the stairs where there is a landing that gives me an unobstructed view of the northern sky, north of my residence.  Sure enough, the lights were still there and were moving slowly in a northern direction at a slow speed.  I hurried back down the stairs and into the back door of my residence and called to my wife, son and daughter to come outside and look at what I was seeing.  We all went back up the stairs to my previous location, looking north and sure enough, the lights were still there, continuing to move north however, during the time of our observations, another light emerged just over the horizon and seemed to be following the previous three.  There were five more obj! ects that followed and all four of us stood there in amazement because there was no sound to be heard, there was no pattern to their flight together at all and over the next few minutes, all of the lights faded away. My wife captured a short video of the objects on her HD cellphone video camera, however upon review, it was nearly too difficult to see the objects given that the ambiance of the city street lights quashed anything that could clearly define our observations. For argument sake however, I asked her to keep the video for reference if questions were ever raised about the four of us seeing all of the same occurance. We came into the computer room and went online and observed that these objects had already been reported by someone in Martette, MI, but they observed 15 of the objects. Sometimes I have to be a skeptic because we do live close to the Selfridge ANG base in Mt. Clemens, MI, however on the Canadian side, and the orange lights would be indicative of jet engines in after-burn taking off, however, Selfridge ANG, 127th Wing only has the A-10 on location at this base and they are a subsonic aircraft their engines have no afterburners, so the typical orange glow could not have appeared behind those aircraft, even if there was a full squadron taking off, but yet, there was no sound to the movement of these objects. That was a very cool experience for my entire family and myself simply because we are hoping there is intelligent life in outer space and in some cases more intelligent than any of the life on this planet. Cheers!!  Thanks for the show!! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded and credible.

Bright light appears on highway with other drivers witnessing.;2016-08-27 22:15:00;3 minutes;Bright light appears on highway with other drivers witnessing Exactly 10:15 pm, driving east on highway, with 2 other cars ahead and 1 behind.  It was hot, muggy, humid with patches of fog in air.  A flash of light straight ahead which was about 1-2 miles ahead, was thought to be lightning was brief, then light lit up the right side of road ahead of cars, and lasted longer around 3 mins.  It was a brilliant white light which cut through the haze and fog, with a focal point that showed it was landing or hovering, and was gone as fast as it appeared.  It was out of the ordinary, the area was on the outskirts of city, trees, bush and farm along the highway, the two cars put on brakes ahead, and stopped as light appeared.  Therefore, they must of noticed how strange this light appeared.  Also, I slowed to a stop, and car behind.  After incident all cars turned left and continued onto city, without investigating including self.  Shrugged it off as lightning in that brief period, until reached home when a strange feeling that witnessed a rare event  was convinced it was unidentified, as to the reactions of other drivers also.;42.9820066225167;-82.3419920529802
Six lights a minute apart from W to E then disappearing into a specific area of the sky.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-16 21:15:00;25 minutes;Six lights a minute apart from W to E then disappearing into a specific area of the sky. Flashes of light dispels satellite possibility Saw a small light - looked like a small star coming from west.  Thought it was a satellite.  As it travelled east and got to the area of the sky where big dipper is, 2 bright flashes of light came from the big dipper area of the sky and the light proceeded then disappeared in the area of the big dipper part of the sky.  We continued to watch a total of 4 of these star-like lights come from the west and 2 slightly from SW, for a total of 6, each disappearing when they got to the big dipper area of the sky.  The 3rd one became very bright with an expanded halo of light just before it disappeared into the big dipper section of the sky. Typically, we don't see 6 satellites all within a minute of each other and their speed and slightly wobbly movements dispel that possibility. There were no other lights such as a plane would have and no sound. We feel we witnessed something extraordinary.;42.9820066225167;-82.3419920529802
