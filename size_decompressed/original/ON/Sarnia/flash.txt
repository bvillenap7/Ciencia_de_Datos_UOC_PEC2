I caught something bright in the corner of my eye very high in the sky.  As I was looking at it, it started to fade.  There were a few light clouds in the area but sky was basically clear.  I did however thought it was star that got covered by the few clouds.  I kept watching anyway and there was a really bright flash and I could actually see an object fly of to east at a high rate of speed.  It looked sort of oval with faint lights outlining only half of each oval.  Sorry not good at explaining.  It made a curve at first and the flew straight until I lost site of it.  I knew then this was not a star.  But I do think there was more than one because after that one left there was 2 more flashes of light in the same spot I saw the first.  But I could not make out if there was any movement after those flashes.  This is the first time I have ever reported anything like this.  But I thought maybe there migh! t be a logical explanation.;42.9820066225167;-82.3419920529802
