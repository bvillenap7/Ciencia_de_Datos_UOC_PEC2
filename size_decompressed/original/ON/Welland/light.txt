A light winding down to the ground;1991-03-01 22:00:00;3 mins;A light winding down to the ground Driving west on highway 3 A light appeared in the south. Looking as though it was very far away. (across lake Erie, somewhere in Pennsylvania). This object appeared to be going down but in a winding motion, but the light never got larger or smaller. We observed the light until it went to the ground. The ground being somewhere close to the shore of Penn. I am not certain if it went to the water or land. Approximately 1 min. passed before the object started up but at a faster rate of speed, vanishing.;42.9952644444445;-79.2559444444444
One being in the water and one light in the sky.;2001-04-10 08:45:00;i minute or so;One being in the water and one light in the sky. I was walking my friend home and he pointed out a light shining on the shore of the canal. I looked and noticed a sort of flashlight beam bouncing on the rocks. I then looked in the water and there was a pinkish thing in the water. I freaked! I didn't know what it was. It turned it's head a saw us. We were the only people, that weren't zooming by in cars. I seen eyes imbedded deep within its face. As soon as it saw us, it dipped under and we didn't see it again. My friend did not see this entire thing, but he can confirm that there was something there. He was busy staring at the light in the sky. It was moving, in sort of what seemed like circles, very fast. It first looked like a spotlight coming up from the ground, but it could because the clouds were low and you would be able to see the beam. I thought it could be a helicopter, shining its light from above the clouds. But that would work because there's absolutly nothing like that around here. The object disappeared then came back after about thirty seconds, then disappeared again. We waited awhile but it did not return. ((NUFORC Note:  We will request a report from the second witness.  We believe that the witness may have meant 8:45 p.m., but we will inquire.  PD));42.9952644444445;-79.2559444444444

When observed through binoculars it appeared as if it had one light at a point and three light in a row at the opposite end.  I took a video and tried to get a close up and all it showed then was a glob. ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter??  PD));42.9952644444445;-79.2559444444444
