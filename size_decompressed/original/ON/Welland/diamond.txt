Over the years I have observed northern lights, meteors, satellites and all kinds of commercial and private aircraft.  Rarely have I seen anything out of the usual until the evening of Tue. May 27, 1997.  Because of engineering studies at university I haven't had time until now to send in this report. What got me interested in getting in touch with the UFO Center was hearing Peter Davenport on the Coast-to-Coast AM radio program on Sat. Feb. 20, 1999 at 1:30 am EST.  I wasn't aware of the UFO reporting center website until that morning.  He had mentioned that some people had reported seeing a large diamond shaped object.  This is something like what I saw. I spotted a brightly lit yellowish orange four-sided diamond shaped object over Welland, Ontario, Canada.  It had well defined edges with the light being more concentrated near its edges.  It approached from the northwest below the Big Dipper at 11:05 pm EDT with no sound.  Its size was about a thumbnail's width at arm's length.  In view for about 15 seconds, it moved across the sky in a straight line and disappeared below the southeast horizon. An estimated altitude was 40,000 feet which gives an approximate width (using trigonometry) of 800 feet across its beam.  In addition, this object moved with its larger interior angles being front to back. I again saw the same object (at least it appeared the same) a week later on Tue. June 3, 1997 at 11:50 pm EDT over Welland and its behaviour was the same as that described above. This eerie looking object was certainly something different as it was too large for a satellite, shuttle-craft or the Mir station, and it was moving extremely fast for its estimated height above ground.  It also didn't have the characteristic port and starboard red and green lights nor the flashing white or red strobe lights associated with known aircraft. I hope that this information will be of interest to you and that it can be used in collaboration with other reported similar sightings.;42.9952644444445;-79.2559444444444
