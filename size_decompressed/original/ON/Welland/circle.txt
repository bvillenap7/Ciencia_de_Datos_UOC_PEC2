round very bright white light;2005-09-23 00:00:00;30 minutes;round very bright white light Around 8 P.M. on Friday September 23, 2005, my husband and I were outside, when he noticed a very, very bright white light in the southwest sky elevated about 30 to 45 degrees from the horizon.  It had not moved at all for several minutes.  We got a pair of binoculars and took a look.  What seemed to be a round brilliant white light with a few smaller blue and red lights around it.  Extending from the central light were 3 wing-shaped protrusions spaced at 120 degrees. It seemed to fade as if moving back, and then returned to the original site.  After watching it for approx. 30 minutes, it seemed to sink downwards, and out of view to us due to house blocking it.;42.9952644444445;-79.2559444444444
White/Bluish Circular light from SE  over Welland Ontario.;2013-05-26 21:30:00;2-4 seconds;White/Bluish Circular light from SE  over Welland Ontario I was out on the back deck before sunset and noticed a bright (led type) light could have been slightly bluish... shoot across the sky from SW to S.   This was only a couple seconds, and completely vanished, might ad that the object was extremely low so it seemed.   We had clear skies and it seemed very peculiar.  It had no flashing lights that I normally see with planes.  I would love an explanation as we have seen number of things facing the South, SE and SW direction.  Any insight would be helpful;42.9952644444445;-79.2559444444444
