dull metallic grey sphere observed while working on a roof, no sound, no lights;2004-05-27 12:10:00;5-6 minutes;dull metallic grey sphere observed while working on a roof, no sound, no lights while working on a roof in welland observed what i originally thought was some kids balloon. was talking to my boss on my cell at the time and i was looking at the sky. one of the persons living there was below me and i said to him what i thought. anyways, watched this balloon for a good five minutes when i thought the wind was wrong. this thing was travelling north to south and the wind was out of the southwest. it was a dull metallic grey (not shiny) moved in a jerky line basically staying at the same height which was hard to judge because of the blue sky background. originally i figured it to be about 200 feet or so high, however it disappeared behind some light clouds for a few seconds, reappeared, then disappeared behind heavier clouds, cloud ceiling was approximately 2500 ft. a guess at size would be substantial, in order for me to see it that high and for that long.;42.9952644444445;-79.2559444444444
