This lasted over a period of 45 minutes. When flying they were much faster than airplanes and looked nothing like anything I have seen before. They were orange/yellow fireballs.;42.9952644444445;-79.2559444444444
Orange fireball with triangular frame flew directly overhead, then sped away at extreme speed;2013-07-24 23:20:00;2 minutes;Orange fireball with triangular frame flew directly overhead, then sped away at extreme speed I was driving my car on Thorold Road in Welland travelling east, between Rice Road and Centennial Drive.  As I passed Centennial High School on my left, I noticed a large orange object in the northern sky.  As the object approached my position, it looked like a sphere with flames emanating from the top of it.  It was the orange colour of fire.  I stopped my car, picked up my iPhone from the centre console and exited the vehicle. I was out of the car when the object flew directly overhead.  It was the size of a single engine plane, approximately 400 feet in altitude, travelling at a leisurely pace and no sound was heard.  I saw a sphere surrounded by a triangular frame.  The sphere was orange, and the triangular frame surrounding the sphere was brownish red in colour.  As the object continued on a southerly heading, I was able to take 2 photos with my camera phone.  I have attached them to this report.  However, they are not of high quality.  I have also provided a sketch of what the object looked like when it was directly above me. After taking the second photo, the object picked up speed very quickly, and within 2 seconds was out of visual range entirely.  I believe that it sped away, not burning out or disappearing.;42.9952644444445;-79.2559444444444
