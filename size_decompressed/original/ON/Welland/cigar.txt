In the evening, after dinner, my little sister(8) at the time, ran into our home in a panic and hyperventilating.  While lying on the floor, she pointed to the outside.  Thinking some bullies chased her, I went outside on our corner lot to take a look and then I saw it too, coming over the field near our house.  It was a huge black cigar-shaped ship the length of a football field and it slowly, very slowly hovered just above the tree tops.  It came right over the other houses and then it stopped right over our house.  I had two other sisters who saw it.  My mother came out too and saw it.  I ran to maybe four other homes and got them to come out and see this.  I was 13 at the time and very excited to know these things really did exist.  This craft just stayed there for about 1/2 hour hovering and it made a soothing humming sound.  It had some red and white lights flashing off and on the underbelly of the craft.  When it got dark out, the humming increased in pitch and frequency, then the craft slowly turned around while going upwards, turning faster and faster while it went higher and all we saw were three white lights spinning until it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is sighting is approximate.  We have invited the witness to have her younger sister submit a report, as well.  PD));42.9952644444445;-79.2559444444444
strange things in the sky;2002-06-02 22:00:00;2 mins;strange things in the sky last night i was siting out and enjoying a fire and just watching the stars, when i see what i first thought was a falling star,(from west to east)..... but what cought my attention was the varing speed at which it travelled moderate to hovering to full boogie) many many times faster than any plane i have ever seen, then it stopped and hovered then sped off, came back west a little, then i could cleary see it go completely verticle in a spiral then headed south. I have never really believed in UFO before last nigt. also i kept a more carefull eye on the sky aftward and noticed about six more very very high speed things all going southernly at one constant speed, and looked like a more straight or direct route,??????.......;42.9952644444445;-79.2559444444444
