Halo whitish yellow disc that hovers and can change it's colour from green to red in reaction/response.;2018-07-01 22:00:00;3.5 hours;Halo whitish yellow disc that hovers and can change it's colour from green to red in reaction/response Went outside to watch the fireworks.  Looked up in sky and there was a glowing halo like disc shaped object bright whitish yellow.  It appeared to react to the fireworks and flashed between red and green lights while the fireworks were going on.  As if communicating or reacting. Called in to my mother and she couldn't believe it when i pointed it out to her and she asked me what it was.  Later on when driving home ~01:30 there were 3 craft in the night sky in different locations.  They were heading south and south west.  My mom witnessed this too. Freaked her out. They appear to be yellowy white in colour (hottest temp indicator) and stationary with a orbital halo around all of them.  They are also jerky in their movements and can move quickly.  Saw one the night prior hovering in the night sky over Port Colborne.  It was the same.  It is not a weather balloon.  It was really weird.;42.9952644444445;-79.2559444444444
