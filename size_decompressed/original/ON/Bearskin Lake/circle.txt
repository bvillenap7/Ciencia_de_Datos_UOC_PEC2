Bearskin Lake ON, Circular disc with 4 lights seen 500 ft above ground heading East At approx. 19:00 hrs. my two children ages 10 and 6 were looking out our front livingroom window which faces West, and saw what they described as a circle shaped object flying in the sky about as high as our communications tower (500 ft) above the ground.  They described it as being a circle with 4 lights on it. The light colours were red, green, blue and yellow. They said only two colours flashed at the same time, then the other two.  When asked if they were sure it wasn't a plane, my 10 year old daughter gave my a funny look and said dad, I know what a plane looks like and this wasn't a plane.  When I asked them to draw a picture of what they saw, they both drew a circle shaped object with 4 lights under it.  I was in the bedroom at the time of the occurrence and did not see the object for myself, but I do believe my children as they know the difference between the truth and a lie, and have been raised to respect authority.  The two reported that the object wasn't moving fast, nor was it moving slow, but somewhere in between, which gave them just enough time to remember what it looked like. Bearskin Lake is a remote First Nations Reserve in Northern Ontario, approx. 350 km south of Hudson Bay (Fort Severn).;53.9333;-90.9833
