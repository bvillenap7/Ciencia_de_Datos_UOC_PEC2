Around 10:30 pm I was walking to the store and felt a desire to look up into the sky. I saw a circular shape of bright white lights and another the exact same underneith. It was quite high up and to the North West direction. I stood staring up at it for approximatly 20 to 30 seconds, when all of a sudden it shot straight up with a slight glow behind it, and within a second it was completly gone.;44.0229;-79.8012
