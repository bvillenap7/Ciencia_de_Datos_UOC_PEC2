2 orange/red glowing fireballs Cornwall, Ontario.;2014-08-09 21:48:00;30 seconds;2 orange/red glowing fireballs Cornwall, Ontario. went to sit on our porch, as I stepped outside, I saw right above me in the sky, what looked like 2 orange/red glowing fireballs.   My husband ran back into the house to get his camera, but by the time he got back and was ready to film, they were gone.   They kept the same height - never went up or down as they passed over our house, slightly turning right until we lost sight of them.   No noise, no engine - same speed....was unreal and what an experience to have!!!;45.0537803030303;-74.7098643939393
