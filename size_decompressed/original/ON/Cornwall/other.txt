Triangle U.F.O hovering spotted close to home.;2010-09-02 19:00:00;5 Minutes;Triangle U.F.O hovering spotted close to home. My boyfriend and I were stopped at a red light when something caught the corner of my eye. As I turned my head to look,  I saw a Triangle Object with numerous lights around it hovering in the same spot for about 2 minutes.  This triangle object was almost black and had 2 rows of almost “spot light” looking lights that did not blink on  2 of its sides.  On the other Side there was a row of lights that flashed one at a time going in order.  It then moved fast sideways were it disappeared for about 30 seconds and reappeared shooting the completely opposite way, where it then hovered again for about 2 more minutes and disappeared.   I have never seen anything like this in my entire life. It scared me because I knew there was no way that it could be a helicopter or airplane.   After it disappeared My boyfriend and I carried on our way home when stopped at a stop sign near the outskirts of Cornwall, We saw this triangle thing again just fly at an incredible speed and just disappear completely.  We have not seen it since.  But I am truly scared knowing that this very well may be a U.F.O. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
