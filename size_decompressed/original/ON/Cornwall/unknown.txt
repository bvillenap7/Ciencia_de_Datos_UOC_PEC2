This is a report on what I believe is a UFO sighting.  It was shortly after dusk. It was dark but not yet pitch black. I was driving past the primary power distribution site for the local hydro power facility near Cornwall, Ontario, Canada. The facility is on the high ground about a mile from the road. I noticed a bright shaft of light above this facility. I thought at first it might be a helicopter inspecting the transformers. The light was extremely bright and well defined. There was no sound. I then realized that it was too wide for a normal spotlight - possible 100 feet wide. The light then acted in a manner not possible with our technology. Still bright with well defined boundaries it began to slowly withdraw upward.  The object that it was withdrawing into was not visible. Light in our technology is either on or off. A light beam as we know it cannot slowly withdraw. The light boundaries were too well defined to be a natural phenomenon. For this reason I believe I was witnessing a paranormal event. My wife also witnessed this sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));45.0537803030303;-74.7098643939393

Called my daughter downstairs for her to have a look at it. We could see red,green, and blue flashing lights, the object seemed to stay stationary, with binoculars the shape seemed to look like a narrow triangle.The object did seem to move higher in the sky as daylight approached. As for distance I feel it was far enough away, roughly the size of a large star. We viewed it for at least 45minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Report is not inconsistent with the sighting of a celestial body, we feel.  PD));45.0537803030303;-74.7098643939393
ascending light disappears, reappears;2008-09-01 23:05:00;2 minutes;ascending light disappears, reappears I've never had the pleasure of entering a report before. I wish it were more exciting. I was stargazing a clear sky from my apartment window. After about 10 minutes, I noticed a light approximately north-west. It could have been a mile away, it could have been 10 miles away, but I saw it for a few seconds moving straight up into the sky. It was about 10 degrees above the horizon when I first spotted it. A yellow-white moving light, about the size of a star or satellite.  Though it blinked out after only a few seconds, after about 20 seconds it had risen by one or two degrees and appeared again for one or two seconds. Each time the object reappeared it had climbed about a degree. It had the luminosity of a bright star. Not as bright as Sirius.  It could have been in the proximity of Ottawa. I'm just happy to have seen something I couldn't explain. After it last disappeared, I watched the sky for a few minutes and saw a regular satellite proceeding from north to south at the speed of a standard slow-walker until it disappeared beyond the trees. Not a plane, not a satellite, not a flare.;45.0537803030303;-74.7098643939393
