Yeah,contact me at (613) ((number deleted));2003-03-29 02:40:00;5 minutes;Yeah,contact me at (613) ((number deleted)) At 2:40amET I spotted 3 stars flying from the southeast,heading northwest across the Big Dipper,and disappered immediatedly west of it.Reflexively,my eyes and mind saw it as shooting stars,but they were in a V formation,and the two trailing stars were zig-zagging a little bit.They were to slow for shooting stars,but way too fast for jets,and there was no sound following thereafter.About 5 minutes later,I saw a close but irregular formation of 8 to 12 stars(at the same speed of the previous 3)fly in from the south,and disappear at the same point,just west of the Big Dipper.I don't know who to speak to about this.Hopefully I'm not the only one that saw thisIt was mere coincidence that I was outside my house,enjoying the night sky.Yours truly, ((name deleted)).
