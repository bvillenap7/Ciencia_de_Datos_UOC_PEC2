Objects moving across low altitude above Cornwall.;2015-07-05 21:00:00;10 minutes;Objects moving across low altitude above Cornwall Moving west to east viewed from the cornwall hospital. First 2 black objects with a non blinking red light, followed by 2 more singles within 2 or 3 minutes.  They made no sound.  My coworker and I had never seen these types of objects and I spent 16 years in the Military so I know what a drone or a helicopter looks like.  The fact they made no sound was weird. they moved at a steady speed all the same speed, not overly fast.  I would have thought baloons but they usually dont have lights and would not move in a uniform line and would not have lights.  Some departments reporting off behavior of patients within the hospital??;45.0537803030303;-74.7098643939393
