I woke up around 3:00 am, I had the habit of looking out my bedroom window when I would wake up.  I looked over to my left were hydro (power) lines run behind apartment buildings, and that is when I saw the first ufo, it was bell shaped, and had a single light moving (like a spot light) on the dome of the ship.  I was slowly and silently glidding over the hydro lines, I kept watching in amazement, then the second one came into sight doing the same as the first, I could also see small objects twirling around the hydro lines then going up to the ship, then back to the hydro lines.  I watched for quite a while, it was very quiet out, dark sky, I am not sure if the moon was out.  Then I happened to look up and slightly over to the right, and there was a ufo right above the house.  Not a sound came from it, the body of the ship was a silver colour and the dome was a smokey green colour (same colour that comes out of a puff mushroom when you step on it), the ship was huge, I could not see any sky. My heart started to pound in my chest, I was never so scared in my life as I was at that moment.  It has been almost 30 yrs since I saw the ufo's, and I can still remember as if it happened yesterday, I will never forget for as long as I live.  I did wake my brother up, but by that time the ufo's had gone, and of course he did not believe me and still does not to this day.  The next day there was a report in the newspaper about a sighting in another city on the same day. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));45.0537803030303;-74.7098643939393
