Floating red object over local baseball field.;2006-10-12 01:23:00;27 minutes;Floating red object over local baseball field. Very large, about twice a football field. It was humongous and round, it was red. Dark red. It was mid day, so very easy to see the colour. It had glowing spots on it, wich I beleive were windows or hatches.

3 Orange Spheres;2012-07-11 22:30:00;45 minutes;3 Orange Spheres My wife and i were sitting out on our balcony last night when i noticed a Sphere, bright orange, almost like fire.  The Sphere was relatively low in the sky and was moving from East to West at a slow pace, the whole time the Sphere was flickering a little, but, at one point it flickered and got darker and smaller till it just disappeared. I pointed it out to my wife who said well it could be this or it must be that, but it is wierd. Then, we saw a second one approaching the same area we saw the first one disappear...this one did the same exact thing as the first, disappeared in the same spot.  The third one we saw was more to the West, by this time i had my old video camera out and caught the last one....also flying slow then flickering till it was there no longer.   I was really happy to have caught that one on tape!! I have never experienced anything like that before and neither has my wife, we are both really amazed and maybe still in denial?  Though i am convinced what i saw was other worldly.;45.0537803030303;-74.7098643939393
