Erin Ontario UFO SIghting;2010-04-30 21:00:00;3 min;Erin Ontario UFO SIghting This is what happened. I, my brother and a close friend were driving to my cousins in Erin, Ontario.  We were coming close to the edge of the town, when my brother noticed something moving in a strange way in the sky.  It turned out to be a star and the moving clouds created the illusion of it moving.  As I looked at the star I noticed something else.  It looked like a tear from the side but from below it was a triangular shape.  It had a red light on what looked like the aft of the vessel. It was so close I thought it was a plane making an emergency landing.  We opened the windows to see what it sounded like, and heard nothing at all.  If it was any known craft in this area it would have been deafening at the distance it was.  We decide to follow the craft as far as we could we got to the edge of the town and watched the craft fly east at a steady pace, stop, hover, then fly west, stop, hover, then continue north west.  The three of us are still unsure what this was! and there was no reported military training in that area.  A week prior to this my brother and I were outside my house when we noticed what looked like a star moving very fast across the sky.  I said that it was probably a satellite just I  I said that the star stopped moved the opposite direction, so east, and then continued its original path, until it was out of sight.  My brother and I have had a number of experiences with these phenomenons.  We used to live close to military base Borden in Proton Township, and we would see these same types of craft all the time.  Being located so close to the military base they let the community know when they are training, and none of the sighting to which I speak of corresponded to these training exercises.
