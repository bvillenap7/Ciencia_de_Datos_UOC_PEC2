Silent low flying craft in Niagara Falls;2012-08-12 03:45:00;15-20 seconds;Silent low flying craft in Niagara Falls Was on the peak night of the Perseids Comet on August 12th, 2012.  Me and a friend were sitting in my backyard listening to a cd and counting the shooting stars we saw as we did the year before. We started watching the meteor shower around 11pm counting a few dozen each. Like a competition.  Then around 3:30 or 4am my friend said &quotwhat the...&quot. I saw him pointing to the sky. And i saw it and said &quotwhat the heck&quot. &quotIts a huge chunk of metal&quot. It was travelling slowly, had no propeller, no wings, was greyish, and i remember saying &quotit has right angles&quot. It had no lights, but even in the dark sky it was easily visible.  This thing was totally silent, it just floated by. It was so low, it seemed only 4 or 5 telephone poles above the ground. I took out my smart phone and quickly tried to load an app called 'space junk', an app that tracks satellites in real time using GPS. After fumbeling with it for a couple seconds we both just watched as it passed over my house. For some reason, i thought it could have been a satellite that fell out of orbit. We talked about it in disbelief for at least an hour afterwards. It was an exciting and t! errifying experience. My friend said he wished he never saw it. Anyways ive been trying to find out anything about it since then. Like how to obtain radar data. I cant find any info. I would like to remain anonymous. We never told anyone because unless you were there, its totally unbelievable. Before that night i didnt doubt their existance, but was skeptical about claims people make because of all the hoaxes. But i will never forget that night and whenever i think about it, i get kinda scared. It was so close, and that night we described it as being at least the size of a house or apartment building. Im just trying to find answers, and i dont care what anyone says. What we saw was not lights from a distance, or some shabby camera work, it was low, so low you could almost make out seams in the metal, or whatever it was made of. Anyways, publish this if you wish, but either way im always still gonna be searching for answers, for personal validation. Like i told my friend, if! only one of us saw it, we wouldnt know if we were crazy. But ! two of u s watching the same thing, undeniable.;43.0846993902439;-79.1018554878048
Rectangular shape moving between lakes Erie and Ontario;2020-06-14 23:00:00;30 seconds;Regtangular shape moving between lakes Erie and Ontario Rectangular shape with approx. 5 separate groups of 3 lights in a row flew overhead, no sound. Mirage like field surrounded the anomaly, wavering like a heat mirage on the road.  We have seen this same craft {?} heading in the same direction last year almost to the day. Anomaly moves from SSE to NNW. Seems to travel between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.;43.0846993902439;-79.1018554878048
