Star-like and grey spheroid hover Niagara Falls.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a twinkling star, we suspect.  PD));2016-11-29 21:00:00;Continuous;Star like and Grey spheroid hover Niagara Falls 21:00 HRS Bright Star like image nothing out of the ordinary.  Located Due East  between 60 & 70 degrees from the Eastern horizon when suddenly the same star like figure was busy making small manoeuvres.   (example take your thumb hold it straight out, close one eye and the shape of your thumb nail.  That would amount to the movement that caught my attention.  A small U turn say!  The size of your thumb.  This Light was busy for some 3-5 minutes at this point.  I looked for about 5 minutes and found my binoculars. The Bright Star like figured continued to move as I tried to focus supported by a fence post. It appeared like a star with no features were outstanding.  While searching with the binoculars trying for a closer look I seen about 3 & 5 spherical spheroid grey objects that appears to shoot low beams of light sometimes from the Bright Star to the other spheroid object that flew about in some organized manner about the Star Figure.  I can recall seeing the light beams going back and forth among each other. While this was going on about 3 or 4, 747 or similar flew over head at different times.  To me it did appear to have made contact with perhaps the pilots of the jet-planes (747).  I would not be surprised to learn that pilots and others have witnessed.;43.0846993902439;-79.1018554878048
4 Weird lights seem to be repeating a pattern in sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights??  PD));2020-10-04 22:30:00;4:00;4 Weird lights seem to be repeating a pattern in sky 1030pm Oct 4 I noticed 4 Weird lights in the sky outside my window. They are moving in a repeated pattern. The four round lights seem to be going in a clockwise direction but then they come together to form a single light, then seperate and continue in a clockwise direction. It's almost like they are  doing a maneuver or something;43.0846993902439;-79.1018554878048
