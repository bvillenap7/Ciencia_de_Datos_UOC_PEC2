The summer of 1987 was the time the stars themselves came out to dance!;1987-07-01 20:30:00;2 evenings;The summer of 1987 was the time the stars themselves came out to dance! During what I recall as being a warm summer's night back in 1987, I chanced to gaze straight up into the clear (moonless?) sky as I sat chatting with my landlady on her back porch steps. Although there was a noteable diffusion of light across my field of vision due to nearby city streetlamps, the view of the night sky was such that countless stars could still be clearly identified. To my surprise, however, the field of motionless stars I expected to see was instead replaced by a field of 'moving' stars, meandering slowly about in a fashion much like tadpoles in a small pond. These objects replaced the stars, they did not obscure them. That is to say, I could not observe anything at all in my field of vision of the sky except the objects. There must have been 30 or more in that particular area of the sky. They had the same shape, size, color and brightness as the stars I fully expected to see. They did not exhibit any visible trails or emit any audible sound. I pointed out the phenomenon to my landlady and she observed them as well as I. We had the luxery of being able to watch the event for as long as we pleased: the objects were still moving when we retired inside for the night which was about an hour later. The next evening was almost identical in terms of viewing conditions. As I sat next to my landlady in the same location as the night before and roughly about the same time, we both observed a repeat performance of the event. A short while later, two friends came by to visit and observed the phenomenon with us. It scared me very much and I can only imagine the reaction of the witnesses with me, although they did not appear to be outwardly that concerned. To this day I cannot explain the event to my satisfaction. For those were the nights the stars themselves came out to dance! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Bright colorful Shooting Light.;2010-04-01 22:00:00;1 Minute;Bright colorful Shooting Light. Me and my mother were sitting on our front steps of our house one night, having a ciggarette.  I always look at the sky and was, except i seen these lights blinky and coming close to the house.  It seemed like a plane from far away, but as it started getting over top of the house, it looked like a normal plane, but flying with its nose and tail vertical instead of horizontally like normal.  I waited for it to fly normal and so did my mom.  The weirder thing, was it didnt make ANY sounds while moving like most objects do. It almost seemed like this thing attempted to impersonate a craft we use, and while using it, screwed right up.;43.0846993902439;-79.1018554878048
Weird irregular stealth looking craft below the clouds;2019-09-28 11:05:00;<1 minute;Weird irregular stealth looking craft below the clouds I was making a left turn at a red light. The conditions were overcast. I happened to look up in the sky, and witnessed an object just below the clouds. I don’t exactly know how to describe it. It was dark grey or black almost stealth looking. It had multiple sharp looking panels and looked somewhat similar to the craft from the move Battle: Los Angeles as I really don’t know else to describe the look.  It was very odd.  The light turned green, as I made the turn I keep watching it very confused at what I was seeing. I got about a 1/4 mile down the road and decided too turnaround go back and get a better look. By the time I got back the object was gone. I did look around the area and there was nothing suspicious or anything out of the ordinary that could have mistaken me for what I saw.;43.0846993902439;-79.1018554878048
