flash in sky over Niagara;2009-07-31 23:00:00;10 seconds;flash in sky over niagara me my daughter were watching airplanes and looking at stars with binocculars i was telling her about trying to keep yours open for meteors and satelites, i told her the satelites look like stars moving in a straight line and so on then she said she seen one and was trying o help me see it then she said it appeared to slow down afer about 8 seconds i still couldnt see it then it disapeared she said then a second or 2 after that we i saw a white flash about the size of a penny and as i was turning to ask her if she seen a flash she interupted and said did u see that and i said what cause i wanted to see what she seen before i told her what i saw since she is 11 already and did want to put any thing in her head so then i asked her were it was compaerd to the last place she saw the satelite and she said it was just to the left up a bit with the obect moving down ward so that would mean the satelite could not have made the flash unless the satelite could have mov! ed backwards, so maybe the flash was space junk or comets coliding or maybe hiting the atmoshere some how made a bright white flash idk or maybe government or alien sonic boom or warp speed ,idk but what ever it was it was pretty cool to see thi with my daughter if any one knows what the flash was id like to know because it was very far away could it be a super nova ? hmm well any ideas would be appreciated thankz.

PD));2011-07-01 23:45:00;1 sec;Hi,my name is francis im 42 yrs old,have 3 kids,2 grandkids.I live a normal life with my family.  We all live beside each other,myself,mywife,and my youngest still at home ,16,22,23. I dont feel comfortable talking about this,with all the things we read,and watch on tv about men in black,and all that crazy,scary!stuff. I have to stress again im a normal person !NOT CRAZY....... I have been into ufos since i was a child,all the tv shows,pictures, storys,and news,probably 35 yrs now.  I always watch the sky,walking,riding my bike,when ever i can.  Friday,canada day weekend  here where i live,my wife and i were leaving to go to my familys canada weekend party.  Opened our front door,it faces north.  Right away we both saw a round object,flying from south to north,im not sure how high it was,but it looked higher then whatever clouds there were in the sky.  It was glowing dim,the best way for me to describe it,is it was a white light,dim,soft.  It was after 9 pm,the sun wa! s just startint to go down.  It traveled in a way,if you draw an s in the sky,but add 1 more bend,then banked right,and looked like it took off during its last right bank,and was gone,almost like it blended into the sky!  Now last night i was driving home from niagara falls at 11:45 pm approx,sunroof open and i caught in my prefreal vision a huge light that flashed in the sky.  I have no more time to say more but wow wow, ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  Date is flawed.
