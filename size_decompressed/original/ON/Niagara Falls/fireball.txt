A green fireball falling to our south, maybe 5 or 10 miles away.;1999-03-13 03:43:00;1 minute;A green fireball falling to our south, maybe 5 or 10 miles away. We saw a bright green fireball falling, how long it was there we don't know, we only saw it once it came below the top of the windshield of our truck. It fell from that point, and appeared to fall to the ground or into Lake Erie, somewhere to the south of us.  It appeared while in the sky, to be the same size as Venus appears here, but was much closer, maybe 5 or 10 miles away.;43.0846993902439;-79.1018554878048
For about the past year I have seen 3 slightly faint orange lights in the sky, and they don't move around. They stay there for like 5 t;2010-09-08 22:00:00;3 hours;For about the past year I have seen 3 slightly faint orange lights in the sky, and they don't move around. They stay there for like 5 to 10 minutes then fade out for 15 minutes,  But then come back for 15 minutes then repeats the process until it wont appear. I have noticed cause I see it all the time at work when I go for a smoke, and that it only is out some weeks for a couple times over 2 months. Then you wont see it for like 1 month or 2. This is in Niagara Falls, Ontario Canada mostly visible on Clifton Hill, because I think the lights from all the business places lights up that part of the city. It is in a line form, but the one in the middle is off the line closer to the oneside, and forward a bit. When the strobe lights from the beer garden (on clifton hill) hit it only the middle one will reflect the light, and the others are just visible without the strobe lights like a orange hole in the sky (The one on the left when facing north is more visible but not bright, If u know what I mean?). It will stay there for like 3 hours straight above your head until it fades away, and doesn't come back. Sometimes it's like 6:00 p.m, 7:30 p.m, 10:00 p.m, and maybe 11:00 p.m when it first came out. The channel 4 news did a story on it from the videos that got from on youtube (under Niagara Falls ufo) , from like 5-10 different people +.They said it was frozen ice particles creating the delay flash back resulting in a reflection, But why would u beable to see the other two with no light reflecting off it. It's like a 1/4 the size of the moon (so not a star) , and is not a sattelite visible at night time. They also suggested the balloon incident from the states for publicity, but why do they stay up there perfectly still. No planes crash into wires when flying under them, plus the objects are way to high up to be seen. They must be extremely big for me to see them that high up, and so big in sight. Last sight was a week or 2 ago in beginning of september 2010. If u could email me back with your thoughts or comment on this that would be GREAT. I have been curious to what this is for like a year, because when seen with your eyes all explainable conclusions are not there. Thank you for your time.

Simultaneous fireballs flying over niagara falls and burning out;2013-07-21 22:05:00;5 minutes;simultaneous fireballs flying over niagara falls and burning out At around 10pm in Niagara Falls, Ontario, people were notified that fireworks have been cancelled.  A couple minutes later a light appeared above the eastern horizon.  I couldn’t determine the size of the object, nor approximate elevation.  But I can say it looked like elevation was increasing and it west travelling to the South-west. Aside from the size and elevation, this light or fireball looked like it was travelling about the same speed as the commercial airplane.  And by this I mean it looks like it would take the same amount of time for the fireball or light to fly across the sky as an airplane. I want to say it was more like a fireball because of the flickering yellow and orange light it was emitting.  The fireball was pretty big when it came over the horizon, but it appeared to either burn out, or exit the atmosphere.  I think it burned out though it didn’t look like it was travelling fast enough to just pass through the atmosphere.  BUT, there was no sign of projection.  No hot air balloon would travel that fast, and it wasn’t burning any fossil fuels because it didn’t leave a trail of smoke.  All it did was float south-west bound for about a minute and a half before it completely burned out.  After it burned out there was still a floating silhouette of a sphere-like object, but only visible momentarily. While I was still looking for the object after it burned out, someone pointed back to the eastern horizon and there was a second fireball.  Travelling in the exact same path and it burned out at the exact same place.  There wasn’t really a timed gap between the 2 fireballs.  They were pretty simultaneous. I couldn’t figure out what was going on so I thought I would report it and hopefully someone will either tell me what just happened, or maybe my report could help someone else’s investigation.;43.0846993902439;-79.1018554878048
