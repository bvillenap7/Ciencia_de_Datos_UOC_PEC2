Formation of about 7 disc shape objects fly north to South in Niagara Falls North End.;2008-08-27 16:00:00;10 seconds;Formation of about 7 disc shape objects fly north to South in Niagara Falls North End. While in a parking lot on Thorold Stone road (by corner of Dorchester Road ), looking Westapproximately 7 or possibly 8 objects in formation of about 4 in a front line, and 3 in a rear line moved in a straight line from North to South. I thought they were planes at first, but there were no tails or wings I could see, the looked black on the bottom and white on top, eye or disc shaped and made no sound at all, even after about 30 seconds-1 minute waiting.  They flew behind trees and out of sight. There were no distinct markings at all, just black and white color with smooth surface. Height was under 1000 feet, very low, from the ground about 2x the height of most average size tree's in the area and looked less than 1 mile away, so they were close enough to see details. My eye sight is better than most peoples and the sun was out and sky clear with only high clouds. They were likely planes, had no camera or time to use one if I had, I'm hoping others saw this and can clear up what it was.;43.0846993902439;-79.1018554878048
Lights over Niagara River.;2016-09-22 08:45:00;5 minutes;Lights over Niagara River I had been hiking the Niagara gorge trail, and upon my return, I paused for a drink of water.  When I looked up at the moon, I noticed 7 lights in formation (some white lights, some were red lights).  They were travelling from the west to the east.  Sometimes the white ones would get brighter and then disappear altogether.  The red balls of light were the most fascinating.   I'm 44 yrs. old and I've never seen any lights like this before.
