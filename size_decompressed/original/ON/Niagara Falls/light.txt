9 to 11 unusual reddish/orange lights which were continuosly changing formation.;2004-08-15 23:05:00;10 min.;9 to 11 unusual reddish/orange lights which were continuosly changing formation. We are located in Niagara Falls Canada,and these lights were in a north east direction (over Lake Ontario). The intensity of light was brighter than venus. A very spectacular display, lasting more than 10 mins. Formations changed from linear to staggered to W shape to v shape, and finally ascending one by one and disappearing. This was all witnessed by 8 people working the night shift at a manufacturing plant, just outside the city. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Lights seen over Niagara Falls hoevered for 1 hour & 45 minutes;2009-11-15 07:20:00;1 hour 45 minutes;Lights seen over Niagara Falls hoevered for 1 hour & 45 minutes Appeared in the sky around 7:20.  SDame object as I reported on the 10th, but lighting was different, this wasn't as bright this time but in the same spot in the sky, DIRECTLY straight north. This time I was prepared with a camera. Object was not a reflection or light aberration of any kind it was very large and seemed to be thousands of feet up.  Even though at times the sky was clear, it always seemed to be HAZY or partially cloaked. It went up really high around an hour 30 minutes, then came back down, then disappeared. 15 minutes later it appeared again for another 15 minutes then was gone.;43.0846993902439;-79.1018554878048
2 light fireballs in sky with a blue one in middle(Blue one only seen when spot light hits it), 2 are like a dieing car light (visible);2010-09-08 23:30:00;2 hrs;2 light fireballs in sky with a blue one in middle (Blue one only seen when spot light hits it), 2 are like a dieing car light (visible) For about the past year I have seen 3 slightly faint orange lights in the sky, and they don't move around. They stay there for like 5 to 10 minutes then fade out for 15 minutes, But then come back for 15 minutes then repeats the process until it wont appear. It only is out some weeks for a couple times over 2 months. Then you wont see it for like 1 month or 2. Mostly visible on Clifton Hill, because I think the lights from all the business places lights up that part of the city. It is in a line form but the one in the middle is off the line closer to the oneside, and forward a bit. When the strobe lights from the beer garden (on clifton hill) hit it only the middle one will reflect the light, and the others are just visible without the strobe like a orange hole in the sky (The one on the left when facing north is more visible but not bright, If u know what I mean?). It will stay there for like 3 hours straight above your head until it fades away and doesn't come back. Sometimes it's like 6:00 p.m, 7:30 p.m, 10:00 p.m, and maybe 11:00 p.m when it first comes out. The channel 4 news did a story on it from the videos that got from on youtube, from like 5-10 different people +.They said it was frozen ice particles creating the delay flash back resulting in a reflection, BUT WHY WOULD U BE ABLE TO SEE THE OTHER TWO WITHOUT THE LIGHT REFLECTING OFF OF IT???????????. It's like a 1/4 the size of the moon (SO NOT A STAR) , and is not a sattelite visible at night time. They also suggested the balloon incident from the states for publicity, but why do they stay up there perfectly still. No planes crash into wires when flying under them, plus the objects are way to high up to be seen. They must be extremely big for me to see them that high up, and so big in sight. Last sight was a week or 2 ago in beginning of september 2010. I have been curious to what this is for like a year, because when seen with your eyes all explainable conclusions are not there. Thank you for your time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));43.0846993902439;-79.1018554878048
3 Lights that are orange, and fade in and out for hours (+ reflect off casino spot lights);2010-10-03 21:15:00;1 hr. 30 min;3 Lights that are orange, and fade in and out for hours (+ reflect off casino spot lights) I sent a report 2 weeks ago about the orange lights in the sky, and it was out again. 3 lights in a line form, very high up, and they don't move.  The lights are like orange holes in the sky, and reflects the light off the casino spot lights.  Its in the same spot everytime it is seen, but only stays there for about 3 or 4 hours tops. (approx. 20th time seen out of 1 year) ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have been observing twinkling stars.  PD));43.0846993902439;-79.1018554878048
(Blue light)  travelling a little faster then a plane that pulsated...then stopped and vanished;2010-11-30 18:30:00;30 sec;(Blue light)  travelling a little faster then a plane that pulsated...then stopped and vanished Went out for a smoke in my backyard, and a pulsing blue light was moving fairly quickly. A little faster then a normal plane, but then it slowed down very quickly and was moving so slow(almost as if not moving). I took out my phone to take a picture but then it pulsed and like made slight duplicate image overlapping. Then it just was gone.;43.0846993902439;-79.1018554878048
