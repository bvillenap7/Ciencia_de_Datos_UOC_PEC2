Then a few seconds later  we saw the same light seperated into  3 lights again and turned  red and yellow adn orange and green so fast like a blink.. then we started to follow it  but it just kept on doing the same thing.. i don't think it was any kind of an airplane!

Three lights close to each other glowing and fading.;2019-09-06 03:20:00;5 minutes;Three lights close to each other glowing and fading. It was just before 330 and I stepped out on my balcony sat down and sparked a joint.  I was staring up in the sky when three lights appeared.  The light seemed to glow and fade repeatedly.   I didnâ€™t  wanna move fearing that I would lose sight of these lights, so I called for my wife and together we witnessed it glowing and fading away.  This went on for about 5 minutes until lights disappeared in thin air .;44.0510799999999;-79.4696535714286
