4 circular orange lights in Newmarket, Ontario.;2014-10-11 20:15:00;5 minutes;4 circular orange lights in Newmarket. October 11th at 8:15pm.   For the second time, we saw orange lights, but this time it was 4 of them.   In July 21/2014 around 10pm we was two orange lights and disappear so fast and a very interesting way.   Last night, 8 of us saw the 4 lights.  Very interesting site.   This is the video we took:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLPkKseKsaA.;44.0510799999999;-79.4696535714286
6-7 Red/Yellow globes that moved together, but not in a pattern.;2019-03-08 00:00:00;10 minutes;6-7 Red/Yellow globes that moved together, but not in a pattern This is the second time I have seen a UFO.  The first time was many years ago.  In 1992, Scarborough, Ontario.  At that time, I saw something I couldn't believe and I somehow felt overcome to go away from it... which, as anyone who knows me, is the exact opposite of what I would want and do.  I wanted to go to it, but something told me to turn away from it.  I reported that years ago.  And, I've always regretted not following it, and hated that it was the time before cell phones where you could just take pics. So the other night, I was sitting outside having a cigarette, just after midnight.  And over the horizon, I see a group of about 6-7 crafts of some sort.  They didn't have any real consistency of pattern, but they were fairly close.  The lights were huge and bright, red/yellow/ and a blue-ish purple on the outer edges.  But it would dissipate, and they get smaller, and less colorful, almost like stars, but their movements were not normal, they could hover for ages in one spot, then they'd disappear, reappear, brighter and glow like, then they'd turn back to nothing but a star again.  It was so odd.  And because I had seen the previous one and always regretted not being able to take a pic or follow it, I made sure to go inside and get my phone and take a video of what I saw.  But, by the time I got out again, they seemed much further away and not as many.  But in my video you can still see something strange.  I took a follow up video when I saw more lights, but I don't know if they are connected.;44.0510799999999;-79.4696535714286
