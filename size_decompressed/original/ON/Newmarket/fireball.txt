3 Blue green balls of light with streaming orange yellow tails. Tails resembling sparks.;1999-11-16 18:09:00;30.sec;3 Blue green balls of light with streaming orange yellow tails. Tails resembling sparks. I was travelling south bound on Woodbine Ave, just on the east side of Newmarket. I noticed to my right (west) a stream of blue green lights glowing in the western sky, just above the horizen moving in an eastern direction. At first I though that an large airliner was making an approch to land,except for the fact that there were no landing stips in the area. I pulled over and got out of the vehicle as fast as I could. I continued to watch the three balls of light drift almost directly over me. The stream was stretching across the sky at about 30 degrees right above where I was standing. The tail looked like orange yellow sparkles that faded as it passed over me. It faded or burned up completely just as it passed over me. I heard on the radio at about 13:06 EST that they mentioned that the Leonids meteor shower would be active but that the sighting that they descibed (very briefly) was what I had seen was not part of the Leonids but mearly a stray! If it was a Russian rocket booster (Yeah right!),they should get a gold medal for making it this far east.;44.0510799999999;-79.4696535714286
This low flying object emitted no sound but lots of orangey, fire ball like light.;2010-07-01 22:37:00;2 minutes;This low flying object emitted no sound but lots of orangey, fire ball like light. We saw a very low flying orangey object that emitted absolutely no sound, but lots of light.  The speed was not very fast, but there was a very large orange aura around the flying object.  There were no pulsating lights of any colour ruling out the factor of a conventional aircraft. We went out into the street for a clear view of the object.  I had two trees as a frame of reference for how this object was moving.   I stood very still, and found that the object was moving slightly side to side between trees which, was very strange to observe.
