They were orange with almost a red glow to them.  They did not flash or make any sound.  They moved slowly across the sky in the same flight pattern and then turned and headed south.  I ran in the house and had my children come out to see them and then had my neighbours come out as well.  My neighbours only saw the last 3 glowing orange/red lights and these ones were traveling in the formation of a triangle.  After awhile when there seemed to be no more coming, my neighbours went inside their home and my daughter and I walked down the street towards our house.  We then saw one final bright round orange/red light coming across the sky in the same flight path.  We then stood on our driveway talking to my mom on my cell phone staring at the night sky when suddenly a comet (or something similar) shot directly over o! ur heads no higher than 3 stories up.  It had a long tail, was grey and disappeared as it reached over our neighbour’s house.   I turned to my daughter and said, “Did you see that!?” and she responded, “Yes, and I made a wish!”  She thought it looked like a shooting star.
