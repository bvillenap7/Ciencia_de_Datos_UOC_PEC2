small triangular object viewed through 8 telescope while looking at moon;2001-08-29 00:22:00;10 seconds;small triangular object viewed through 8 telescope while looking at moon I was looking at the moon through my 8 telescope.  I was using a 32mm eyepiece with a televue 3x barlo and a #25-A red filter.  While observing the moon noticed a small black object moving around. I witnessed it changing directions and speed several times before leaving the view of the moon.  The object appeared so small that a shape was not visible until it appeared to lean to one side where the lighting changed to reveal a triangular shape (as if it had wings).  When the object looped around it would cover a distance of about one 30th of the view through my telescope.  It turned 3-4 times and leaned over once over a period of about 10 seconds before leaving the view of the moon.  This object appeared very small but VERY CLEAR through my telescope.

Large triangle craft and Two bright orange craft over Newmarket , Canada;2009-08-11 01:00:00;6 mins;Large triangle craft and Two bright orange craft over Newmarket , Canada While outside for a cigarette noticed a large object with three very bright orange lights.The lights were in a triangle and the craft was very large and may have been about ten thousand feet in sky.It moved along from north to southwest at a speed quicker than a normal pass jet.We watched it for about 2 minutes then it just vanished. After that craft vanished about a minute later two more very large round orange lights appeared close to where the first one was sighted. They both moved along side together at a slow speed and would stop and fade in and out.Both seemed to be traveling the same course as the first one but would turn direction a few times then stop fade out turn again then head south again We watched them for about four minutes or so before they just vanished. Both sightings were at same altitude going in the same direction with no noise at all. The sky was fairly clear with some clouds.;44.0510799999999;-79.4696535714286
