We saw a boomerang shaped object in the sky behind our house just above the tree line.  It was slowly travelling away from us but seemed as though it was desending from the atmosphere.  It was an orange/red v shaped and the apex of the v seemed to glow brightest.;44.0510799999999;-79.4696535714286
4-5 lights in chevron shape moving extremely fast and low with no sound.;2014-05-24 22:50:00;3 seconds;4 - 5 lights in chevron shape moving extremely fast and low with no sound. Sitting in a park in Newmarket looking out onto an open space with lots of sky visible. Chevron shaped formation of 4 -5 yellowish-red lights.  Object appeared moderately low in altitude and shot through the sky on a straight NNW bearing.  No sound was heard and object disappeared from view in about 3-4 seconds. Appeared faster than any plane we had ever seen, so that, along with the lack of sound and strange shape, prompted us to file this report.;44.0510799999999;-79.4696535714286
It was a boomerang shaped object that had faded rainbow color and went around it self in circles and changed altitude once in a while.;2019-03-19 22:00:00;15 minutes;It was a boomerang-shaped object that had faded rainbow color and went around it self in circles and changed altitude once in a while. Me and my friends stood in front of our street, a humid street with no cars coming at the time we just sat down and started staring at it because of how beautiful it was, I have seen many other ufos before with my family in my life but this one was different, it was going in circles and it was clear, like you could actually see that it wasn't a drone, or anything humans could imagine making of. The BOOMERANG-shaped object was always shining with faded colors of a rainbow, like a LED light that just shows faded colors if you know what I mean, I have one that's why I can relate easily.  I noticed that the UFO had kind of a transparent tail that at the end of it was a shiny red light and it was flashing. The object flew around itself for 10  minutes went up and down in altitude and changed direction a few times and just went in circles and up and down, and it was always flashing with that faded colors, it was like a dream!;44.0510799999999;-79.4696535714286
