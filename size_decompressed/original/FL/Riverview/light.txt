Two orange lights moving slowly in unison across the sky.;2012-02-10 18:00:00;10 minutes;Two orange lights moving slowly in unison across the sky. I work at an afterschool program and one of the kids was looking up at the moon.  It was in the early evening and the sun had just started to set.   It was a clear day with no clouds.  The sky was still blue while the horizon was turning orange.   As I was looking at the moon with the two children, we saw two orange lights appear just below it.  We watched the two lights move slowly in unison across the sky.  It did not leave a contrail.  We watched it until it was too far away to see.;27.8404163323786;-82.3151696275067
