Submarine Shaped UFO Hiding Within & Around Clouds;2020-09-09 18:00:00;5 minutes;Submarine Shaped UFO Hiding Within & Around Clouds The best way to describe the shape of the object would be analogous of a flying submarine or plausibly a blimp. It was reasonably larger than a submarine but the overall shape is still fairly unique.  It was semi translucent with a dark gray or black like color. It stayed very close to or within clouds that surrounded it, possibly resulting in the appearance of being translucent, however exposed portions still seemed to have observable characteristics of cloaking or some other technology to conceal it to some degree. It maintained shape as it was very rigid.  It did not transform or alter form like the surrounding clouds. It was completely silent and has no apparent means of propulsion, lift, or other modern flight characteristics.  Surrounding clouds were very still yet this object hovered in and out of view, elevated and descended by hundreds of feet, moved south by a few thousand feet, and then disappeared into the clouds and dense mist like clouds. Everything else in the sky was a pure white cloud. Iâ€™ve seen very similar objects being reported in the past and two similar object recorded outside the window of airplanes, one recent video and one from the 50s or 60s on standard film. The object was located a few hundred feet east of my house heading southbound.;27.8404163323786;-82.3151696275067
