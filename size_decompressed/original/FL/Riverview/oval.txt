So I did just such the first thing I noticed is how bright the moon was.  Then to the left I noticed a bright orangish looking star so I opened a starwalker app on my phone to see what star it was, which came to Mars.  While holding my phone to the sky matching the position of Mars on my phone to the orange star I notice a even brighter object just peaking about my neighbors tree so I pan left to see which star it was.  The only on that was close to the position I was pointing is a star named Menkar but this object was way to bright and slowly rising about the tree.  Within a few seconds it was a few inches about the tree yet the other stars around it didn't move.  Once it got to a certain height it stopped and look to pulsate then stopped.  After about 5-10 mins I went back in the house.;27.8404163323786;-82.3151696275067
