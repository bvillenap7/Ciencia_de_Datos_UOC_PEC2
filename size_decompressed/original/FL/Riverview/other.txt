Dark undulating bubble or cloud with two hoola hoop type rings on either side standing vertical muti-colored spinning lights.;2014-01-19 23:00:00;5-10 minutes;Dark undulating bubble or cloud with two hoola hoop type rings on either side standing vertical and having muti colored spinning lights. Sunday 19 Jan 2014.   While parked along side Interstate 75 South, a Mile to one half, a mile from Riverview Rd.  An object came from the Southern Sky and descended toward me as I stood outside my vehicle, the object was about the size of a large SUV and like something right out of a science fiction film.  I still can not wrap my head around what I saw.   It was less than 500 ft above me when it passed because it had to climb to go over the trees to the south.  It was an opaque dark gray to black undulating bubble, like a soap bubble, and at the side opposing each other were two hoola hoop type rings, standing vertical with multi coloured lights spinning around in the canter of the hoops.   There were no other structures to see, the rings we not attached to the bubble and the bubble was undulating just like a real soap bubble,  You could say it also looked like a dark cloud undulating between to rings.;27.8404163323786;-82.3151696275067
