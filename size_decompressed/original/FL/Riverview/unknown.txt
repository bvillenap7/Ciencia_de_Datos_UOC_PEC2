Red light in the sky;2009-03-16 20:00:00;20 minutes;Red light in the sky Saw red light in sky in same place for long period of time.  There was no noise and when it moved it skated a short distance then stopped and stayed in same area.  Light would get brighter then fade, like it was getting higher in the sky.  Me and my husband watched it for about 20 minutes.;27.8404163323786;-82.3151696275067

I live in Riverview and tonight I was walking my dog and saw something similar to the 8/27/2019 craft witnessed in Tampa Bay. However,;2020-02-29 00:00:00;20:10;I live in Riverview and tonight I was walking my dog and saw something similar to the 8/27/2019 craft witnessed in Tampa Bay.  However, the lights were red, did not blink and there were 3 of them.  The distance between the first two is not even possible for airplanes except in an airshow.  They were all traveling at the same speed in an odd triangle pattern (not an equal distance between the three).  Then the light on the first one was gone, then the second and then the third. From lights on to lights off was about 3 seconds after the preceding one.  Tonight is pitch black and cloudless and I am in a new home community and I was in a large park in the community that no homes have been built. It freaked me out.  I stood searching the sky for 7 or 8 minutes and they never reappeared.;27.8404163323786;-82.3151696275067
Object with blue haze in front and bright white light in back just vanished.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from submarine.  PD));2021-02-10 18:32:00;2 minutes;Object with blue haze in front and bright white light in back just vanished. I am a retired 69 year old female Deputy Sheriff and the following is what transpired:  It was late evening and I was sitting on my back porch when I saw, what I thought was a very bright star in the eastern sky.  My next thought was that it was the brightest star that I had ever seen.  I looked for other stars and there were none to be seen.  I looked back at the object and realized that it was going up and at a slight right angle.  My first thought was that it was a rocket launch from the Cape.  Looking harder at the object I could see a blue haze in front of the object with the bright white light in back of the object.  At this point I called my sister.  I wanted her to see if she could see it also.  When she answered, I started telling her to go outside.  Not having taken my eyes from the object all of a sudden the white light disappears, a few seconds later there was a huge blue flash and then the blue just faded away.  I then went on line and according to NASA there had been no launches that day.;27.8404163323786;-82.3151696275067
