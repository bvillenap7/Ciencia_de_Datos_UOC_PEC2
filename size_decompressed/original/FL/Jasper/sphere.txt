Bright light sets in the eastren sky.;2010-01-01 18:30:00;1 MIN;Bright light sets in the eastren sky. 	I saw a bright sphereical light just under the shoulder of Orion.  My first thought was that I was looking at Venus or Jupiter.  I was going to show them the planet but when we returned about a minute later it was gone. My first thought was that the planet had set behind the trees, but then I realized that I was looking in the eastern sky. Then, I knew I had seen something else the light had not transited the sky and was no where to be seen.;30.5064;-82.9307
