North to South, shooting star no change in mangnitude continued southbound;2007-06-14 22:15:00;30 seconds;North to South, shooting star no change in mangnitude continued southbound I was standing outside with binoculars looking up at the stars, at first I thought I saw a plane, but there were no running lights to see, I don't know if it was the same object, but next thing I know I'm looking at what I first took to be a shooting star moving really fast except that instead of burning up it proceeded at the same small magnitude. I am certain it was not a satellite since it moved way to fast, I am very curious to know what I saw. I just wish someone else was out there to see it with me.;29.9207;-82.6879
