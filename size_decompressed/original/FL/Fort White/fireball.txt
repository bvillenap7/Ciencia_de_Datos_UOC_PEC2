I’m not sure if the “meteor?” exploded in air or after it landed. If I held a quarter at arms length it would be at least that size, but smaller than a golf ball. Briefly, I thought I could navigate to the site, convinced it dropped nearby considering how close it seemed. There is a lot of open area and it may have landed in the woods nearby and no one else noticed.;29.9207;-82.6879
