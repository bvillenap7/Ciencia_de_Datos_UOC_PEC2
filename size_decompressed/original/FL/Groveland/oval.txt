We had just passed through Groveland Fl. This was a very dark portion of the road with no buildings and no artificial light (except for our headlights)  At approximately 9:05pm my wife while looking out of the passenger window of our vehicle observed four green lights that appeared to glow  in the NE sky. The shape of the lights was oval. They were moving in a synchronized almost choreographed pattern in the shape of a figure eight that was turned on its side. The lights never appeared to touch or converge into one in the center of the  pattern. When it looked like they would collide they would suddenly veer away from each other and continue the pattern.    I pulled over and exited the vehicle to get a better look. There was absolutely no sound. My wife , daughter and myself watched these lights from the side of the road until 9:15pm, (10 minutes).  We then got back into our car and continued on west on Fl SR 50 into Hernando County FL.My wife and daughter continued to observe these lights almost continually until 9:36 PM (trees would intermittently block their view as I drove) At approximately 9:25 PM as we drove, we   observed two bright white lights that we attributed to helicopters heading toward the  above mentioned green ovals. One was coming from the North and the other from the South.  The weather conditions were partly cloudy and according to weather.com visibility was 10 miles.  We were returning from a three day stay at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, FL.;28.5624;-81.8752
