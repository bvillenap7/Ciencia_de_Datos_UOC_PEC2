Bright orb that accelerated very quickly.;2014-01-23 21:35:00;3 minutes;Bright orb that accelerated very quickly My name is ((name deleted)) and I am an 18 year old highschool student.  I currently live in oviedo Florida and I witnessed a UFO tonight at 9:35pm on a Thursday.  My girlfriend and I were saying goodbye out in my drive way and that's when I saw a bright orangish red light rise from behind my neighbors roof.  It was very bright and I could not see any detail if the object.  It rose up to what appeared as about 10 feet above the home.  It slowly moved right then stopped and remained still for a good minute.  Just as we went to record what was happened it began drifting away and then sped off away from us and became a little orange dot then eventually disappeared.  There was no noise associated with this object.;28.6536628543501;-81.2022344086027
