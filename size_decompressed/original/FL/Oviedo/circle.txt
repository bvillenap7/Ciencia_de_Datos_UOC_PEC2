He asked if i was seeing this i stated seeing what?  He said look up when i looked up i saw at least a dozen orange lights in the sky going upward on a diagonal line some close others spaced out.   I said i cannot believe what im seeing right now.  As i drove farther down the street i noticed that they were moving slowly through the sky.  I called him back and said lets pull over i want to record this.  We pulled over in a church parking lot you could see airplanes all around the orange lights with their green and red flashing lights so we new it wasnt an airpalne.  As we got out of the vehicals all of the lights started to vanish.  Stunned in amazement we were walking back to the cars trying to figure out what we just witnessed when another car pulled up rolled the windows down and said please tell me you guys saw that we explained what we saw and it matched what they saw.  Truely cant explain what we saw all I know is it made me a believer that there is something else out there.;28.6536628543501;-81.2022344086027
A grid formation of 30 or 36 lights, no noise.;2013-10-05 21:30:00;30 seconds;A grid formation of 30 or 36 lights, no noise. It was a grid pattern of vertical and horizontal lights about 5 or 6 rows of lights in about 5 or 6 columns deep.  It was out the right window of our car and we circled back to see them again and 30 second later there were only 2 left and I had my camera out by then and a took a photo of the 2 remaining lights.  Very unusual. 30 helicopters don't fly in this type of formation and there was no noise, did anyone else see this?

Swift silent lights move across sky;2020-09-18 22:42:00;10 minutes;Swift silent lights move across sky Went outside with my parents and saw small, orangey glowing orbs in the sky. They moved silently, very quickly across the sky. We live near enough to Kennedy Space Center that I've seen launches all my life--this was nothing like that. No contrails, no noise. Swift and silent, then they vanished. I started taking some video--upon zooming in, they appear to be rotating saucers. A group of maybe about 15 passed by in about 10 minutes. Objects seemed to be clumped in groups of 3, in loose triangle formations.  Noticed bad internet connection in the hour prior to the sighting, with dogs in the neighborhood barking as they got closer.  Background: all adult household, two in their 60s, one in their 30s. Two Masters degrees between us. No history of hallucinations, drug or alcohol use, or paranormal encounters prior to this.;28.6536628543501;-81.2022344086027
