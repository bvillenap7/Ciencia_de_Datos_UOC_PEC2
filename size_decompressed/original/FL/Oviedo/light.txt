My job has me working until 1:45am and I don't get home till shortly after 2. I wasn't tired, so I stayed up late to work on a computer project. I went outside to the front of my home at approximately 5:15 to have a cigarette. I was standing in the driveway of my home, facing the house (so I was facing east / northeast) and looking up at the stars. I was amazed with how clear it was. Usually I can only see a certain number of stars due to light pollution in my area. This night was incredibly clear though, and I could see constellations I only see once every so often. I noticed an airplane fly by. It was high enough so that you couldn't hear the engine, but you could still clearly make out the red and blue lights on the wings. It went off into the distance and there it was obvious there were no more aircraft in sight. As I stood there a few minutes longer admiring the stars, enjoying my cigarette, I noticed a pinpoint of light almost directly overhead. This was much different than an airplane. With an airplane (especially at night), you can always see the wing and tail lights which are often red and blue. This was a single white point of light that appeared. It flashed overhead for about 2 seconds, then disppeared. About 10 to 15 seconds later, it appeared again, heading in a southerly direction. It flashed again for 2 seconds and disappeared. Then, after another 10 or 15 seconds had passed, it flashed again. That was the last time. If I had to measure the distance between the flashes, I would say it was equal to the amount of sky that two adult hand widths would cover side by side, extended at arm's length. I followed the path of the light to see if it flashed again, but it did not. This is what made me even more suspicious because there were still stars in the sky above where the flash would have appeared that were clearly visible. There were no clouds over the house at the time and, again, I was amazed that the sky was at clear as it was. I wondered if I could have been seeing a satellite, but it didn't make sense that it would be flashing or that it would only flash three times and disappear. The brightness of the flash was about equal to the brightness of Mars or Venus on any clear night. Less than a minute after I spotted the light, I went inside to look at the clock on my cable box. I used this clock specifically because the time is set by my local cable company and it would make sense that it would be the most accurate clock in my home. The time was 5:22.;28.6536628543501;-81.2022344086027
20 bronze lights in the sky crossing in the same path ..the came in 3 lights at a time.;2012-12-08 21:40:00;10 minutes;20 bronze lights in the sky crossing in the same path ..the came in 3 lights at a time. I saw about 20 lights in all they came in lights of 3 in the sky they had a bronze color to them and they all went in the same path across the sky I never saw anything like this in my life . 3 of them would come across the sky and 5 sec later there would 3 more and on and on . it was really weird.;28.6536628543501;-81.2022344086027
I was walking down the street to my neighborhood at 4 AM, and hovering what appeared to be maybe 150 feet from the ground (MUCH closer;2014-01-11 04:00:00;30 minutes;I was walking down the street to my neighborhood at 4 AM, and hovering what appeared to be maybe 150 feet from the ground (MUCH closer than a plane would fly) was a concentration spheres of light, with a blue beam coming from the center bottom of the object.  The blue beam seemed to be moving, and then the large lit up craft suddenly dissapeared.  The craft remained slightly in sight for about ten minutes, then lit back up to its original brightness, and in a split second flew backwards--it went from being relatively close to the ground to behind the cloud line in less than a second, the object traveled an immense distance in an unreasonable amount of time.  Then the object proceeded to get brighter and dimmer in the sky, get larger and smaller, and appear and reappear.  I got a good look at the bottom of the object in the sky, and it had 5 points, somewhat resembling a starfish shape. the whole ordeal took about 30 minutes, and I live in Florida I have seen sh! uttles, planes, satalites, and choppers, this was unlike anything I have ever seen, it really didn't look like something human kind was capable of inventing.;28.6536628543501;-81.2022344086027
