We were driving home to our apartment and I noticed something with bright lights in the sky.  As we drove closer to the apartment complex, the light became more noticeable above the horizon and the trees.  It was a stationary light, smaller than the moon, about the size of a large star in our night sky.  It had two lights, one green, and one red.  They were very bright, like iridescent Christmas lights.   I showed my mom, and then I turned away for a split second, then my mom exclaimed,  It’s moving down towards the ground!”  Sure enough, the light moved straight down towards the ground, behind the trees, at a steady pace.   This all happened within 2 minutes, and we were so astonished, we didn’t have time to take a picture.;28.6536628543501;-81.2022344086027

Can someone contact me who is an admin Normal night with friends, went to movies.  Dropped off my friend at his house, then proceeded  to go inside to hang out and talk for a little bit.  Then after hearing his neighbors glass letting door open we look out of the window decedent his neighbor's in both houses to his sides, so that means two different houses and also multiple others in the street all looking into the sky to see all the houses in the street at one in the morning, covered in grows everywhere.  That being weird enough, I decided it was time for me to get home and just go to sleep because I was a little bit freaked out.  As I was driving home at around 1:30 AM, I felt somehow the need to just kind of look at the stars.  When I looked up, I saw I do not know whether is a formation or a triangle, but it was three green dots in the triangle formation still above the area of where like a forest is.  The triangle of green dots then went from a still position to going faster than I have ever seen anything move and then up and then gone.  After that I sped home physically shaking, as I had goosebumps I was extremely scared the lights on the side of the street had turned off behind me by were my friends house was and I was in tears I was so shaken.   I am now overwhelmed with the feeling of paranoia right now as I write this, I have taken sheets and covered my windows and locked my door and I'm really scared right now please someone just tell me what I should do;28.6536628543501;-81.2022344086027
