I was sitting on the beach and out of no where I saw the most unbelievable giant oval shapped flash of light exploding in a giant burst of Orange which slowly switched to a green and then dissapeared. This even lasted about 3 or 4  seconds and it was no flare gun...  This color was way out above the horizon but close to water and the explosion of color covered a great distance even from far away.  That same night there were helicopters, airplanes and boats in and over the water each.equipped with lights shining on the ocean.;28.1086;-80.5803
The objects looked controlled--but no engine sound.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from retired airline pilot.  PD));2014-07-04 21:45:00;3-5 minutes;The objects looked controlled--but no engine sound. We were sitting on our 5th floor patio-looking at the ocean, when the first object appeared travelling from south to north--offshore-yet following the shoreline. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we found him to be a credible witness.  At last contact, he reported that a person had informed him that the objects were Chinese lanterns, and that he was going to go with that explanation.  We suspect that the objects were not lanterns, but we cannot prove it.  Please see other reports from Florida for this date.  PD));28.1086;-80.5803
