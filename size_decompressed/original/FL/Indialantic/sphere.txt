Glowing blue sphere, escorted by military fighter aircraft. Indialantic, Florida;2001-03-01 19:00:00;1-2 minutes;Glowing blue sphere, escorted by military fighter aircraft. Indialantic, Florida I am reporting a sighting from 2001 in the town of Indialantic Florida.  Late one evening, I was outside on the patio of the home in which I was living with roommates. I was startled by the sound of jets flying very low overhead, coming from East to West from the Atlantic Ocean.  Like anyone would, I looked up instantly to see two military jets, with a spherical object between and slightly behind the (2) aircraft. My first impression was that the object was attached and was being towed by the jets. At this point I called a roommate and his mother outside to witness this as well. One of the jets turned South, and the other turned North. The object moved further behind the northbound aircraft and followed it out of site(toward Patrick airforce base). Seconds later a third military jet flew over and continued west, until out of site.  Here is a description of the object. It was about twice the height of the tail fins on the aircraft. The object was perfectly spherical, transparent, and emanating a blue light. We were clearly able to see what I could best describe as blue plasma, or thick blue and white smoke roiling inside a transparent sphere. It was like looking at a flying crystal ball.  I make no assumption as to what it was, however I know beyond doubt what we saw, and that the military is aware of it. Regardless of its origin, it was very much out of place.  I would love to talk to someone who has had a similar experience it really is almost impossible to believe unless you experience it for yourself.
