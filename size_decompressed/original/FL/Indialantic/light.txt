I pulled into the mall and got out of my truck. Then I noticed 2 other people watching it as well.  We heard no sound and saw nothing but a red light.  After about 5 minutes it started to move to the southwest and rise to a higher altitude and disappeared.  The couple told me that they saw 6 of the same lights on New Years eve in the same town over the ocean in a V formation.;28.1086;-80.5803

Bright green and red light with a flashing white light rose very quickly from the tree-line to an estimated 300 feet, stopped, swerved back and forth quickly, then ascended rapidly again (maybe 100 more feet) before rapidly descending back below the tree-line.  May have been a toy helicopter/drone, but the lights were very bright if it was one and it moved very quickly and went very high for a toy. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere about his sighting.  PD));28.1086;-80.5803
