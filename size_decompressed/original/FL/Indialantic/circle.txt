Red lights in sky over Brevard;2012-09-23 00:00:00;5 minutes;Red lights in sky over Brevard Looking up into the night sky I witnessed two glowing red lights.  One was smaller (further away) and one seemed larger and closer. The lights were very red - round circles and appeared to be moving closer rapidly.  Not side to side or up/down. I thought they might be meteors. I went inside to grab a video camera but only captured a very short clip of one.  I went back inside to put the camera back, when I came out, one was gone, and the other seemed to be pulling away and then suddenly vanished.;28.1086;-80.5803
Circular craft at beach.;2015-07-22 23:00:00;3 minutes;Circular craft at beach. Circular aircraft hovered over the beach at night very close to the ground about 100 ft away from my group of about 7 friends  with a beam over the water for 2 minutes as if contemplating to abduct my friends and me.   It left then came back, this time closer.  It sat with the beam over the water then it went a way at a speed a plane is not capable of.  I got a video as it flew away.   All my friends say it was a plame but planes are not circular, planes do not have beams, and planes fly high in the air.   Also airplanes have places to go, they dp not stop.  Leave then come back and sit in mid-air.  I've always kind of believed in aliens but now i know for sure;28.1086;-80.5803
Four reddish orange balls, ascending at different times, no sound, no trails.;2018-03-22 20:05:00;5 minutes;Four reddish orange balls ascending at different times, no sound, no trails. I was walking my dog when I saw a reddish orange ball rising above the trees.  At first I thought it might be a rocket launch, but it didn't have a trail, and it didn't fade out of sight like launches do.   As it was rising another one appeared and the first one disappeared.  Then the second one was gone.  Then another appeared and within a moment another one, they rose together, but not as high as the others and then they were gone.   I kept watching for more but there were no more.  There was no sound and the intensity of their color varied from reddish orange to red and back again.   As they rose they did so at different speeds.  They were not in formation.  We on the coast are accustomed to launches,  I've seen many over the past 33 years.  These objects were like none I have ever seen.;28.1086;-80.5803
