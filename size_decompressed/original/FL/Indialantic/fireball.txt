It was at about 3000 Ft and would fly a circle pattern and drop to about 10 ft off the top of the ocean in about 1/2 second.    Then it would fly an s pattern back up to where it was first at and circle closer drop.  It did this many times and kept coming closer.    I tried to get it on my cell camera but my wife was freaking out.   I was a FA-18 avionics technician for the Marines for five years and I currently hold a top secret ssbi clearance and work with avionics systems and I am on the new JSF program for the company I work for.  I am ahead of my times in technology.  I have never seen anything move like this before.  I am also 3/4 of the way through ground school and I have 28 hrs in a R22 helicopter.     In my time I have never seen anything move so fast.  I started really researching into this after I lived through what was called the San Diego Boom read the article on this if you want to hear some crazy news that just died away with no explination...  It was on the front page of the San Diego union tribune...  then everyone just forgot about it. http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/northcounty/20060423-9999-1n23bigboom.html   Read this!!!!  You tell me     I live right by the Cape now and I know what a shuttle sounds like when it re-enters the atmosphere      The sound this made was 1000 times that if not more.  It felt like an earthquake.;28.1086;-80.5803
