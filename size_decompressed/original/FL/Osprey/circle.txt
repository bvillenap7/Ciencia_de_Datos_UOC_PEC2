Observed a concentric circular object with flashing lights--lavender turquoise/blue and soft yellow.   After about 4 minutes, a section of the object separated from the main object as a bright white sphere and descended out of sight.    Spent time frantically trying to locate my camera.  Found camera and was able to get one photograph of the remaining part of the object which then disappeared.;27.1808;-82.4822
