Orange lights over Siesta Key 11-10-15;2015-11-10 15:20:00;20 minutes;Orange lights over Siesta Key 11-10-15 I saw this over siesta key (from my vantage point on the bay in Osprey) tonight at 7:30p. It was a large, orange-red, solid light that had another close above it. They started to rotate counter-clockwise and the distance between them and they grew larger as I assume it was moving in my direction.  It began a slow ascent laterally (to the south) at about a 45 degree angle and then vanished.  It was followed shortly after by three separate large, solid, orange-red, solid lights that appeared (one by one) from below the horizon and followed the exact same path before disappearing.  The sky was very clear with a few noctilucent clouds sparely about.  There were approximately 3 planes present moving in different directions and at much higher altitudes (distinguished by their flashing lights).  The odd lights I describe were much bigger, solid and different in color than any aircraft I have ever seen.  The whole ordeal took about 20-30 minutes.;27.1808;-82.4822
