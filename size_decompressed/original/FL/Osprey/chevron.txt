(5-10k Ft.)and moving in a steady fast speed.(faster than any aircraft)  Observed looking south moving from NW to SW direction. Sky was mainly clear with some light clouds to our east. No moonlight. Very strange! Never seen anything like it.  NO BS! Would like to discuss this incident with anyone.;27.1808;-82.4822
