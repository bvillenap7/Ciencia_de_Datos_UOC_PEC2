3 bright lights slow moving.;2016-04-29 22:30:00;5;3 bright lights slow moving. Driving west on commercial Blvd near the turnpike saw 3 bright lights appear to be hovering or moving very slow.  As I approached I used wires and tree like to indicate the movement as I was stopped.  Proceeding forward the appeared overhead a couple thousand feet.  Looking up they appears almost lie helicopters in a very tight formation.  But I could tell that they moved together perfectly so helicopters are not like that. The was a lead light and one on each side but very close to each other moving very slow east. The lights didn't flash or blink at all;26.16155;-80.22805
