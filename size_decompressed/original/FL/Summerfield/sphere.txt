3 balls of light;2002-07-25 20:50:00;maybe 5 sec;3 balls of light Eating dinner and three lights caught my husbands eye out the back window, he yelledwhat the @#$% and dropped his spoon and ran outside. I thought there may be something after the chickens because that is where the back window looks out to and I could not understand why he did not grab the flashlight and the rifle because we have been having critter problems. I grabbed the stuff and ran outside and insted of him going out back he was looking into the sky. He said there were three white circles, then they merged and turned a yellowish color and then they were out of sight of the window. There is some thunder way over towards lake county but he is an outdoors person and he insists that it was not ball lightning, he said that if you held your thumb out it would not cover the circles, he said they were very close. I did not witness this, though I wish I had.;29.0107;-82.0355
