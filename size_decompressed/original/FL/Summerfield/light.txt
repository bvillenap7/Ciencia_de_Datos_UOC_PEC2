Star bright Lights, Orange, red fire.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of Venus or Sirius.  PD)) ((anonymous report));2017-01-19 20:45:00;45 minutes;Star Bright Lights, Orange, red fire My first sighting was on 1/18, around 8pm to walk my dogs, I saw a star bright light to the West of my home.  I thought it was the North star, I watched it as it flickered from bright to dim.  At 10pm I went back out and it was gone.  I thought nothing of it. 1/19 -8:45 pm – I went outside to walk the dogs again, same light star bright flickering in the same spot, it was bright, then dim, to dull with a hue, I went and got my cell phone to take a picture after 3 photos, my phone went dead, shut off.  I went to get the binoculars and my sister to see what she thinks. Thru the naked eye you really didn’t see much movement, it looked like it was moving but the light was so bright moving in and out, you were memorized.  But thru the binoculars, we saw  red/orange like fire, it rotated, zig zagged, with several bright lights, moving top to bottom, circular motions, around 9:30pm it disappeared slowly to the South West.
