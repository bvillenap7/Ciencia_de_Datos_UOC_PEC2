She had never seen anything like it.  It was moving very slow for about 4 minutes then it took a turn and flew high into the sky.  It was out of sight within 15 seconds.  Like I said it was bright red and oval. It was so bright that the color seemed to come off of it like a flame.  Also it was flying pretty low.  I would say at least 200 to 250 foot up.;30.621464516129;-81.5913870967742
