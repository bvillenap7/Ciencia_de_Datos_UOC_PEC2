Multicolored lights followed along I95 north Yulee Florida seen by three adults several police reports;1996-06-17 18:00:00;30 minutes;multicolored lights followed along I95 north Yulee Florida seen by three adults several police reports i Just remembered this event not sure why, at about 9pm in mid june of 1996 we were driving north from Jacksonville through Yulee florida and were followed by a series of multicolored lights that kept pace with us at a relatively high elevation.   It was a very dark night and they were definitely following us as we slowed and stopped more than once and the lights did as well.  They never approached or got closer to us on the road but were following the road line directly.  The lights stayed equal distance from each other and would cycle through white, red, blue, green colors with white being the most common.  We did call the state police to report it after we got home and they confirmed several other similar reports that night;30.621464516129;-81.5913870967742
Flashing lights;2008-08-02 23:30:00;5 mins;Flashing lights On August 2, 2008 at 11:30 pm I was awake watching the history channel, and during a commercial break. I went outside on the back porch to smoke a cigarette. As usual I look at the stars (living outside the city of Jacksonville Florida I can really see the stars at night now) I noticed a flashing light. At first I thought nothing about it, because living near the Jacksonville International Airport, you can see aircraft flying over at any giving time. But I noticed that the lights were flashing too fast.  And then I noticed the movement of the lights.  They move up, and then down several times, and then left and right several times, in a fashion that a commercial, military, or private aircraft are not able to do. The movements were in 90 degree’s, at first the movements were in a box, then a cross.  I stood in the grass looking at the lights for a few minutes and they continued moving around as they just disappeared,   I’m am 36 years old and have worked in the aviation field and I have never seen anything like this;30.621464516129;-81.5913870967742
