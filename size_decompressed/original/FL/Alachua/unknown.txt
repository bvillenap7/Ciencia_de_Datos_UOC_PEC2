My fiancé and I are avid stargazers, and have often seen lights static and in motion.  Last night, at approximately 9:30 p.m., we were enjoying this past time while standing on the picnic table in the dark outside of our little house.  My fiancé noticed a furious orange orb of light across the property above the trees it looked like it was a few miles away from us, and incredibly low to the ground, possibly 400-500ft up.   For lack of a better description, the light was large, oblong and gave the appearance a raging fire in the sky.  It came towards us with immense speed and then slowed to a crawl as it flew over us it emitted no sound.   I was unable to make out true shape of the craft as it passed over because of intense lighting on the undercarriage.  However, I was able to tell that it did not appear circular or saucer like.  The undercarriage had bands of reddish/orange light that went the length of the aircraft, unlike any aircraft I’ve seen or researched.   The craft sped up once it had passed us and disappeared quickly behind the tree line.  Whatever or whoever it was intention, and slowed down to look at us, for what reason I do not know.   Later, we tried to rationalize what we saw we do live about 30 miles from the Gainesville airport, however this came from the opposite direction and was definitely not on course for it like every other plane we see. Could this by chance be a secret military plane undisclosed to the public?  And if so, why was it in our area, and why would this theoretical secret craft be so brazen in exposing itself to the two of us?;29.8094254545455;-82.4679218181819
