Three small lights in formation seen at low altitude. no body visible.;2003-10-14 21:24:00;15 seconds;Three small lights in formation seen at low altitude. no body visible. Last night I went outside to walk the dog. It was a perfectly clear night from my vantage point (downtown Orlando was not clear as I was informed by my girlfriend who was in that area. I mention this because I know Mr. Davenport often checks local weather and other possible variables that could come into play.) I found myself starring straight up at the stars and then I noticed a type distortion of the sky directly overhead just as three small dull lights flew in a row all at the same altitude and same speed. I am not qualified to properly judge altitude, but I will state that this sighting occurred at a significantly low altitude in comparison to all other air traffic in the area. I got a real good look and as clear as the night was I could not see a body or silhouette. The lights were not blinking or pulsating. Further, If I recall correctly all aircraft under 10,000 ft. must have their lights on. I am positive there were no headlights or any blinkers, strobes, tail lights ect.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Corkscrew object seen in the Orlando,Fl skies;2006-05-06 01:00:00;10mins;Corkscrew object seen in the Orlando,Fl skies It was 12:30am early saturday morning.  I have serious knee problems and I do my rehab exercises at night.  I jogged to the neighborhood park.  When i finally got there I stopped my jog and streched.I was looking up at the sky because it was an unusally cool night for the Florida month.  About 1 am i looked toward the south towards Osceola/St.cloud County I noticed 5 very bright formations. They almost looked like they were stacked upon one another,yet staggered in a corkscrew 45degree angle.  The formation apeared to be one solid object standing still in the distance. The lights on the object were a bright yellow. Each light at some point faded in and out and had reappeared in the formation very slowly but very bright as it reappeared. As I watched this for a good 10mins, the four bottom lights slowly disappeared one by one. The very top light was left it stood alone in the same spot for about 20 seconds. Then like the rest it faded away. Ive never witnessed anything like this and im sure there will be other reports on this U.F.O;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Four red lights were seen suspended in a square formation over a treeline on Town Center Blvd, heading towards Landstar at 3:00AM;2007-04-26 03:00:00;30 seconds;Four red lights were seen suspended in a square formation over a treeline on Town Center Blvd, heading towards Landstar at 3:00AM I was driving home from work late one night.  I was on Town Center Blvd in Orlando Florida heading towards landstar.  I was going over a bridge when suddenly, I noticed to my right, above the trees four red lights.  I would say they looked like lights one would see on a call phone tower only there was no tower.  They looked as if they were about 100ft apart from each other in a box formation.  It seemed like a rectangle, but more like a square.  The lights lasted for about 30 seconds.  Then after about 30 seconds, they vanished.  I had no idea what I saw, but there were four red lights suspended in the air over a patch of trees.  I was very frightened, needless to say.  This all happened a little after 3:00AM, it was a Monday.  I’m sorry that I cannot remember the exact day it happened.

There are three helicopters in the air all with normal lighting and can be seen hovering near the object .  I called the Orange county sheriffs office to be directed to the FAA in which I was recorded.the object/s shut its lights off and made a strange noise.  I grew up around military aircraft and my step father (retired military) witnessed the event and said it couldn't be flying under current FAA guidelines because it must have a strobe(which is not present)  I am going to drive to a better vantage point;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
multiple lights, multiple colors, changing formation Orlando;2011-04-09 18:45:00;10 minutes;multiple lights, multiple colors, changing formation Orlando My wife and myself  had just gotten out of the pool to eat a snack we had cooked in the oven.  Upon finishing my meal I was just looking up at the sky at the partial moon in the blue sky.  There was not a cloud in the sky.  When I saw a red dot.  As my eyes focused in, I noticed there was a mixture of dots.  Three appeared to be red, four white and one semi green. These dots seemed to be very high in the sky.  They moved around in different directions.  Passing between each other going in different directions and forming straight lines and triangles. Towards the end of the experience they all totally disappeared at the same time.  Then after some scouring of the sky 4 or 5 reappeared  northwest of the original location. There is no way this could have been balloons, satellites or planes. They held the same location besides moving around each other for more than 10 minutes. This is the first time we have ever seen anything like this.  Whatever we saw seemed to have control of some kind, to be moving backwards and forwards and up and down. There is no way this could be weather related. My Wife Googled to see how we could tell someone about experience, because we felt compelled to let someone, because it was really weird.   While Googling we stumbled on a site that had a video on April 8 in Arizona which looked very similar to what we saw.   But theirs was at night and ours was during the day.  And you could distinctively see the three different colors. White, Green and Red.   Even with the sun going down we have never seen anything that appeared to be that high with such color. Just thought you needed to know.  We are glad we found your site to report this.  We feel in our selves that we saw something very special tonight.  It is not B.s..;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Formation of lights at high altitude moving across pre-dawn sky with lead light followed by three more lights in triangular formation.;2013-05-06 05:30:00;10 seconds;Formation of lights at high altitude moving across pre-dawn sky with lead light followed by three more lights in triangular formation. I was walking my dogs just before dawn this morning, 05/06/2013 at 5:30 a.m. when I looked up at the starless, gray sky and crescent moon.  I noticed movement from the east a pin point of light moving quickly across the sky that I believed was a satellite until I noticed it was trailed by three more pin points of light in a perfect V formation that never wavered, changed distance, sped up, or slowed down.   We had cloud cover this morning, so I lost them after about 10 seconds when they flew over the clouds in the western sky (judging the cloud height is how I perceived initially that they were as high as a satellite, along with the speed and consistency). I had the impression of a formation of crafts as opposed to it being one craft or even two with one being the small lead craft and the second consisting of a triangle shaped craft.  If either of these were the case, it would have been enormous in scale.  If they were single crafts, the distance between them would have been vast – enough to see inconsistencies in either speed or distance between the crafts.  I have just never seen anything like it. The distance between the “lead” light and the “top” of the triangle was exactly (or appeared to me to be) the same distance from the “top” of the triangle to the bottom left and bottom right corners, as illustrated.  		. 	.	 		.

Glowing red/orange orbs/craft flying in a path.;2013-05-19 21:00:00;3 minutes;Glowing red / orange orbs/craft flying in a path. I looked out my patio, in the south coming north, central Florida, I saw a orange glowing craft! At fist I thought, wow, that has bright lights, but no, the whole craft glowed orange and was moving toward & over my Condo.  Then, from behind it, another similar orange glow, then another, I paused to calmly observe.  I finally went downstairs and outside to take some photo's.  I think there were about 7 or 8 of these craft following one another, and not in a evenly spaced format.  Eventually the event was over! I clearly saw, numerous glowing orbs/craft flying across the sky and seemingly ascending up & disappear.!   I took 16 photo's. Some show nothing, a couple show three craft in a row, and some have just one object.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

Several clusters of planes with pink lights flying in V formation.;2014-09-11 21:45:00;15 seconds;Several clusters of planes with pink lights flying in V formation. I was at a pool at a hotel lying my back on a chaise long. I was gazing up at the sky when I gazed what appeared to a Flying V. The crafts had purple lights and it looked the formation was in flowing pack. It looked like it was electric geese...with pink lights underneath. The formation travelled across my line of sight in about 10 seconds. They looked like they very high in the sky. Another formation came after the first and floated quickly across my line of sight.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Five orange lights traveling from west west north west to east east south east at high altitude.;2014-10-18 21:15:00;20-25 seconds;Five orange lights traveling from west west north west to east east south east at high altitude. Last night.I saw 5 dull orange glowing lights. They were traveling from west of West North West to East east south east. The lights traveled from horizon to horizon in approximately 15 seconds. The formation of lights was 1 followed by 2 offset from each other and then another 2 parallel to each other. They flew above an airliner so I know that they were at a very very high altitude and were not Satellites. They maintained their trajectory and heading. for the altitude that they were at they were travelling excessively fast.  Does anyone know if we bombed someone in the Central African region?  They appeared to be something like final stage rocket reentry vehicles of some sort.  There were no sounds or vibrations associated with the over-flight.  And, no vapor trails associated with them.  So, they were either traveling in near earth or upper ionosphere.  There was also no change in appearance or fading of their glow and maintained relative distance from one another. Neither they nor the aircraft that they passed over seemed to pay any attention to the other or deviate from their course for fear of collision. normally, if I see satellites they are singular but also behave in the same way.  But the glow was more like a planet then a satellite. Possibly like a Mars type appearance but traveling.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

4 yellow/red lights with little lights trickling under them as they stayed still in the sky in a triangle.  ((anonymous report));2017-02-25 19:35:00;1-2 minutes;4 yellow/red lights with little lights trickling under them as they stayed still in the sky in a triangle-like formation. I was in the car with my friend, who was driving me home, when we noticed a formation of 4 yellow/red lights in the sky, kind of in a triangle formation.  They didn't seem to be moving, but under the main lights were little lights trickling down under them, as if they were falling from the yellow/red lights.   We noticed them in the sky as it was happening and only saw it for about a minute or two before they were no longer in our view.  Once my friend dropped me off and went back to the road where we could see them, she called me to let me know that they were gone.
