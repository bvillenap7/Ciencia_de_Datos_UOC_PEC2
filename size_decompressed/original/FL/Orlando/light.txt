17 lights that appeared they were playing tag in the night sky.;1981-12-01 21:00:00;15 minutes;17 lights that appeared they were playing tag in the night sky. I don't know if this counts since it was quite a few years ago but while driving home from my grandmother's home, my mother noticed numerous lights in the western sky flying super fast, stopping, moving up and down and at various angles.  She told us to look and proceeded to pull over.  My mother, siblings and I got out of the car and watched this strange phenomenon.  It appeared that these 17 lights were playing, flying toward each other and away at unbelievable speeds.  Other people coming out of the shopping center looked up to see what we were looking at. Everyone freaked out. Since I was an 11 year old, I remember telling my mother that I thought they were angels playing tag.  It was unbelievable. The lights appeared the same as stars but were much large.  I would say they measured about 90-100 feet across flying at 7000 feet. My mother was so excited that she telephoned my father and told him to come to where we were to see it but they soon flew abruptly upward after pulling into a tight circular formation.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

It lookedlike a headlight coming through the fog but itwas a clear night with no clouds. It wastraveling at a great rate of speed but couldnot see a shape. Then before my eyes itdisappeared. No lights were to left, right orbehind, just gone. It did not have any blinkinglights which I have observed on aircraft before.strangest thing I have ever seen, and I am astar-gazer who watches for such things.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

One was close to a cloud, and dissapeared behind the coud. The other just went out. We thought they were rocket boosters from the Cape, but there was no con or smoke trail. We were part of a group of German Folkmusik enthusiasts, in a tour bus, from Stylus Transportation, traveling from the Riand Continental Hotel to the Disney's Wide World of Sports Field house, to see an Austrian music show called The Musikantenstadl. I am sure of the time because we were about five minutes from the event, and we exited the bus at the event at 18:50. I looked out the window of the bus and saw the 2 fairly bright white lights, that looked to be about 30 feet in diameter in the sky to the left of the bus. I told my wife to look, and she asked what are those lights. The other people sitting on the left side of the bus also saw them. I thought as did other people on the bus, that they were rocket boosters from Cape Canaveral, although I made the comment that these are the first rockets I ever saw that have no propellant or con trail. It looked exactly like looking directly into the tail end of a rocket booster. We didn't give it any more thought until we returned to Los Angeles and saw a news report of the event on the Monday evening news and found out that there were no missiles fired from the cape. We saw both objects for about 2 minutes. The seemed to be about 300 yards apart, and one was next to a cloud, the other in the open sky.The light away from the cloud just went out about 5 seconds before the other light moved behind the cloud and disappeared. There was very little lateral movement, if any, on either object. ((NUFORC:  Consistent with missile launch.));28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Two slowy flashing red lights observed flying just above tree level with no sound.;2001-03-29 02:00:00;1 min;Two slowy flashing red lights observed flying just above tree level with no sound. Observed 2 Slow flashing red lights that appeared to be hundreds of yards a part just above the tree line.  The two lights were moving from east to west and were moving very slowly.  The lights moved in a very exacting detial as if they were connected to each other, which would make it a extremely big object if we could have seen the super structure.  These object made no sound on its pass.  This was observed at the Deseret Ranch just east of the Orlando International Airport.  There are usually alot of plane traffic in this area.  But these objects did not display the standard navigation lights observed on airplane traffic and were flying to low for normal approach to the airport. 20 mins later observed a small airplane in the same general area but higher in altitude and you could clearly here the engines of this aircraft. We work at a Central Office communications site in which the company rents the land from the Deseret Ranch owned by the Mormon church.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
UFO's manuever over Orlando, Florida;2002-02-04 19:30:00;10 Minutes;UFO's manuever over Orlando, Florida The objects that we saw were about 10 - 15 miles away from our vantage point and looked to be about 8,000ft - 15,000ft above ground level. We only saw the objects as lights or spheres of light from this distance. There were approximately 2 objects, one was stationary and the other manuevered around in a manner which was uncharacteristic of any conventional craft that I know of. It performed tight circles and moved very fast as compared to the commercial traffic in the area, which I used as a comparison. The most dramatic manuever it performed was a tight loop which only took a fraction of a second, then it shot out a thin beam of light to the other object and it seemed to ride that beam up to that object. The light that eminated from the objects was blueish white in color and seemed to flash at different intervals depending on the objects manuevers. These objects were witnessed by myself my wife and two other vehicles that had pulled off to the side of HWY 429 to watch. I am a private business owner with 2 years of aeronautical science course work completed while I was an undergraduate student at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. Additionally I called Orlando International Airport Tower on the day after the incident to inquire as to if they had observed theoccurance, instead of getting an answer I was given a number to call in Washington, DC to report/inquire about the incident.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
glowing pinkish light, thought to be mars, hovered and then dropped from the sky;2003-08-25 01:42:00;7 minutes;glowing pinkish light, thought to be mars, hovered and then dropped from the sky we went outside to look at mars before going to sleep and in the sky we spotted it.  about a minute later i noticed a much brighter and larger pink light to the north.  we then figured that our new subject must be mars.  the shine was bright and it dimmed and grew.  this happened for about five minutes, as clouds passed.  then suddenly, it began to travel straight downward and in a matter of 30 seconds it was out of view, since there were houses in the way.  it was strange and hard to believe.  my friend and i stood next to each other in shock and amazement and then i rused on here to make my report. ((FOLLOW-UP CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS)) Thank you for the report.  Could it have been the landing light on an airliner? ((RESPONSE)) honestly, i dont believe so.  it was not blinking.  it was solid.  and it would wonly fade as clouds assed.   it stayed still for those several minutes and then it dropped straight down.  airline, no.  and the light was too bright.  looked more like a big star, but close.   i am not claiming to know what it was but....it went straight down.  striaght.

Unknown light in sky, blasted off and vanished.;2004-02-16 19:30:00;5 mins;Unknown light in sky, blasted off and vanished. A friend and I were leaving another friends house. I looked up in the sky and saw a moving star. Jokingly, i said to my friend hey look, a ufo. At which point the 3 of us stopped and watched the mysterious light. It looked as if it wasn't within our atmosphere, as bright and as big as all the other stars in the sky. At first it was only moving in a straight line, but then started to navigate and change direction. This occured within a min or less until the object stopped completely. Right after it stopped, it started to get brighter, slightly changing color, but mostly just bigger and brighter. At the peak of the bright light, the object shot off into the distance, with a brief trail following, but quickly faded away. I myself am a strong believer in the unexplained, although i have seen other strange obejects in the past, this was the most recent and most interesting. If anyone has a similar sighting, or maybe an explanation to what we saw, please feel free to contact me through email.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

The light kept increasing and decreasing in brightness, changed it's form, and changed colors from a white light to an orange-ish, red-ish one.   After it disappeared in the distance, a second light lifted straight up from the same spot behind the trees and did the same thing.  There is an airport nearby, but the only thing that could rise straight up and then over like that is a helicopter.  But it couldn't have been a helicopter because the objects made no noise, rose from out of the woods, was only a ball of light that changed brightness/color/and form, and were too small to be a helicopter.

A bright green, flourescent light that traveled at a very rapid speed leaving a trail and changed direction rapidly before disappearing;2004-12-05 20:30:00;about 7 or 8 seconds;A bright green, flourescent light that traveled at a very rapid speed leaving a trail and changed direction rapidly before disappearing My daughter and I were traveling north on Florida's turnpike at about 8:30PM. A flying object traveled northbound next to the turnpike above the treeline in a straight line, dipped and turned up and to the northeast at an incredibly high rate of speed before it completely disappeared. I could not make out the shape of the object - it was a bright, flourescent green light that left a trail as it moved. I have never seen anything move that quickly in the sky (or on land or sea for that matter). I'm 40 years old and have never seen anything like this in my life, nor have I ever looked for it. I cannot explain it and feel strange even having seen it. It was too big to be a model plane or a firefly or some logical explanation. It was too fast to be a small plane or helicopter. The light was not a projected beam because it was self-propelled and moved with precision and purpose. And it disappeared after it changed direction upward and to the northeast.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

But after observing them for about 30 seconds I didnt see the flashing lights that planes have.So I kept my eye on them a bit more the object up in the front stopped the second object caught up to it and appeared to merge into the first one after about 10 or 15 seconds they split up one flying north the other continued east just as I realized that it was unusual I asked my daughter and wife to look up my daughters didnt see them because she never wears her glasses and my wife dosent think ufos are real so she went into the house.I looked up again and the one going east dissapeared and for another 30 seconds the north bound object was still visable then it faded away and I couldn`t see them anymore.I dont know what they were but after seeing airplanes and other aircraft flying these looked alot different.I know one thing In my opinion they were one of two things military aircraft or somthing else.

Odd movement and speed of star-sized object in early morning sky;2005-10-17 06:45:00;7-8 seconds;Odd movement and speed of star-sized object in early morning sky I was walking my dog just before sunrise. As we stopped for a few seconds, I looked up at the sky, which is my habit to do. At about 75 degrees up from the horizon, I saw what looked like a small star emerge from another, larger star...this was probably an illusion,as I believe the smaller object simply passed in front of the larger one. But it was this emerging that got my attention.  I thought, Cool...a satellite, as the small object moved from west to east. I then noticed the quality of its illumination, which seemed to be more of a glow as opposed to reflected light or from an incandescent source.  I watched it for about 4 or 5 seconds, as it moved at what seemed to be a believable speed for a satellite(don't really know, as I am not familiar with this enough to know for certain), when it came to a complete stop.  While stopped, it remained the size it had been (a bit larger than pin head), so I do not think it was coming more in my direction, but was at a standstill.  If I had held a ruler up to the sky along the path it traveled, it would have gone a few inches over a foot, in a straight line, before stopping.  After a second or 2, it bolted in a more northerly direction...this was at about a 30 degree angle to its stopped position, and moving at least 4 times as fast as it had been ( I say this as it appeared to cover as much space going in this new direction in a little over a second as it did when moving in the beginning of my sighting, which lasted 5 seconds).  As it bolted away, it never seemed to get any closer to the horizon, which also struck me as a bit odd.  It remained very visible, and then, it was gone.  I will draw an illustration of this event, scan it, and send it via email soon.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

Noticed star moving across sky...it stopped...continued moving, and changed color...streaked away in a second.;2005-12-28 18:34:00;25-30 seconds;Noticed star moving across sky...it stopped...continued moving, and changed color...streaked away in a second. While checking the night sky, I noticed a star, roughly 2/3 the size of Venus at this time of year (which is quite large), moving across the sky, from SW to NE.  The light it emitted seemed to be more muted in intensity than the stars or planets, such as Venus. This light had no flicker, nor movement of any kind. Self-illuminated? That was my thought about it. Thquality of this lightimmediately struck me as a bit odd, and it stood out from the rest of the night sky.  As I was watching it, I thought I heard jet engines, which I did. Another aircraft passed by, crossing the other vehicle's path, though clearly not at the same altitude. This is when I took special notice...  As the jet appeared to get closer to the path of the first craft, the first craft came to a complete stop...totally stationary...and it sat like this for 10 seconds or so. Once the jet had traveled for about 6 seconds, across the path and beyond, the first vehicle returned to motion and continued on its way. At this time, there was no audible sound from that area of the sky, or anywhere else in the sky...eerily silent.  As this vehicle continued on, I watched it for another 5 seconds or so...as I did this, its color changed from the white light it was emitting, to a reddish orange color. Once the color changed ocurred, it streaked out of sight...yes, it accelerated from the speed it had been maintaining to gone in a second. No contrail, no sound...just gone.  I went inside and immediately told my husband, who agreed that I should file this report.  Just to let you know, I have filed a couple of reports in the past with NUFORC.

We Both asked each what the heck is that, the object just hovered at about 4000 ft for about 15 seconds then turned away from us(the lights resembled that of aircraft turning) so I assumed it turned, and within .5 of a second the object warped out I mean It literally went from a hover to light speed we watched as it disappeared (basically the lights just got smaller till it finally disappeared into space.   It is important to note this object went from a hover to out of sight in .5 of a second.   At which point it did that my instructor and me just looked at each other like did you just see that?   I then contacted Orlando approach to ask if there had been any aircraft off our 12 o clock within 20 miles within the past 2 minutes and they replied no we haven’t had anyone on radar.   Obviously this was some sort of stealth aircraft (ufo).   Since I’ve been flying I have never seen anything like this and thought that it would be worth noting;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

And it was moving slowly, heading from NW to SE. It was about the size of the head of a straight pin, held  overhead at about a 65-70 degree angle. Then, it stopped, and stayed still for about 10 seconds or so, and seemed to pulsate slightly, but noticeably. The color changed to a very, very light grey.

Strange light and illumination  pattern in early morning S and SSE sky;2007-10-23 05:20:00;30 seconds;Strange light and illumination  pattern in early morning S and SSE sky I was walking our Beagle and watching the early morning sky, as usual. As I looked due South, at about 35 degrees above the horizon, I noticed a very odd light.  It didn't twinkle...it didn't pulse...it didn't flash...it wasn't a strobe. It was more of an irregular flicker, much like a fluorescent bulb when it is getting ready to burn out.  It was not regular in shape, but seemed to be extending out from a slightly brighter center point in a somewhat irregular form or pattern. Each illuminating flicker had a bit of a difference to the shape. And the color was odd, not a single shade but a blend of shades.  The size was larger than a medium-sized star, but that included the emitted light form.  It never went completely dark until the last quivery flicker.  About 2 or 3 seconds later it was in the SSE sky, at just slightly above the original degree point...seemed to be same size and description.  (Locations would have gone like this...Original sighting was as if I extended my arm straight out in front of me...Second appearance was as if I extended my arm mid-way between straight in front and straight to the side...hope this makes sense.)  It did its behavior for about another 10 seconds or so and was gone...nothing more.  I scanned the sky for the next 20 minutes while we walked, and it never appeared again.

At about 80 degrees up in the sky, I immediately noticed a star, medium in size, glowing blue...a shade or 2 darker than a robin's egg hue. I use the term glowing because the quality of the light it gave off was not reflected, nor was it incandescent...it was not twinkly. It was a glow. It stood out to me because of the quality of light and the unusual color. As I watched it, it moved slightly in a very minimal southerly direction. The it stopped, and after a couple of seconds it did something that truly took my breath. It dropped, straight down, in a dead fall, at quite a fast speed. Of course, it was so high up that it never did have a great deal of detail in its appearance, remaining a glowing blue medium star size object...but it dropped from about 80 degrees up, to approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. And then it stopped...sat seemingly motionless for a few seconds at that 30 degree level...then took off at an incredible speed, heading due north.

This behavior took place for approximately 10 minutes or so, with the light blinking in and out of view at different areas of the sky...and fairly good distances from each other...in a matter of seconds between blinking out of view and blinking back into view in a completely different area of the sky. And the activity was NOT in a straight line, but all over the sky.  There was no contrail...no sound...just blinking in and out of sight, in no particular pattern.  As a point of information, there were no clouds. The atmosphere was quite clear. And there were no other lights associated with this object.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Blast of white light in the sky.;2008-06-23 19:00:00;3 seconds;Blast of white light in the sky. I went outside to greet some family members who were coming home from a fun day out. It was around 9:00pm. maybe around 45 minutes after 9pm but I am not sure so I will just keep it in the 9:00 hour. Anyway, I walked outside my front door and proceeded to the drive way where some of my family members were getting out of the car and I looked up in the sky right in front of me and saw a blast of light. I can't explain what it was and I don't know if it was a UFO or not but it has been on my mind and I need an explanation for what I saw.  The blast of light was similar to lightning and acted like a firework. Except there was no lightning or fireworks in the sky because I looked to make sure and the light didn't fade off like a firework but just kind of sucked itself in and disappeared. It lasted about 3 seconds and had no sound that I could hear.  It was definitely something I have never seen before and thats the best way I can describe it.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Pulsing blue light crossing sky, from west to east, until no longer visible;2008-07-26 05:50:00;approx. 1 minute;Pulsing blue light crossing sky, from west to east, until no longer visible As I was walking our dog, I looked up at the sky...a regular habit. Immediately, I noticed a light...a blue light, medium to light in tone...the size of a medium star. It was at about 75 degrees above the horizon.  It did NOT twinkle, or flash...it pulsed, never going dark. And the object glowed...not as a reflected light nor incandescent light, but as if self-illuminating. It was moving from west to east, at a steady speed.  As I watched it, instead of following the curve of the Earth as it crossed the sky, it continued to go out, or up, at a gradually increasing incline, until it was no longer visible.  As soon as my dog and I came in, I woke my husband and told him. Then, I called the NUFORC Hotline, and am now filling out this report.  Thanks for any help or insight you might give with this sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Single bright white light moving at very high rate of speed at relatively low altitude.;2008-10-27 20:40:00;3 seconds;Single bright white light moving at very high rate of speed at relatively low altitude. October 28, 2008  Last night at approximately 8:40 pm I was driving North on Dunhill Drive in Orlando preparing to make a Westerly left turn on to Jepson drive.  The sky was dark when suddenly I noticed what looked to me like a single bright round white light in the sky moving at a very high rate of speed, faster than anything I have ever seen, in a North West direction.  It was difficult to tell the altitude because it happened so quickly, but because I was able to tell it was a high rate of speed, I had the sense that it was between one thousand and two thousand feet.  My first thought was that it was the afterburner of a jet aircraft but I could not see any trail and the light was traveling parallel to the ground, not moving either up or down. Also seemed strange to see something like this in an area of relatively high commercial aircraft traffic to both OIA and Orlando Executive Airport. My location at the time was approximately eighteen miles NE of OIA, and approximately nine miles due East of OEA. ((initials deleted))  Orlando, FL;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Three glowing blue lights traveling from North to South;2008-11-07 05:30:00;2-3 minutes;Three glowing blue lights traveling from North to South At approximately 5:30 this morning, I was walking our dog along our usual morning walk trek. Looking up at the stars, as I usually do, I noticed one moving. It had a blue glow, and did not sparkle like stars usually do...it was definitely a glow. As I watched it, it was in the sky at about 80 degrees from the horizon, and was traveling from North to South. Its flight was more like a glide, very smooth. It was different from the way planes and jets move through the sky. And while glide seems to be a bit inadequate, I am not sure how else to describe its motion other than with that word. After a minute and a half or so, 2 other objects joined it in flight...they had the same blue glow. All continued to head South. From my vantage point, I could not really tell if they were in any kind of flight formation or not. One thing that struck me was the flight path. Usually when I notice planes going overhead, they tend to follow the curve of the Earth, getting closer to the horizon as they move further away. These 3 objects did not seem to do that. As they proceeded South, they did not get lower on the horizon, but continued into the darkness of the sky, like they were going away from Earth. Please feel free to contact me if there are any questions.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

Early morning aerial maneuvers by 2 objects, one blue and one white;2009-04-10 05:50:00;60 seconds;Early morning aerial maneuvers by 2 objects, one blue and one white On the morning of April 10...Friday...at approximately 5:50, I watched an interesting aerial display. The first “light”(more of a glow) I noticed was a blue one, which was traveling north to south, at a fairly high rate of speed. It was about the size of a medium star, and the glow of blue seemed to pulsate, but I can’t be sure due to the distance. As I watch it go across the sky, a white “light”(again, more of a glow) suddenly appeared right behind it. It also was about the size of a medium star. Both were, to my ears, completely silent. The blue one blinked out and re-appeared slightly further east in the sky, and was at a complete stop...no motion that I could detect. The white one seemed to slow down and did a little zigzag in the sky, at what seemed to be the same altitude as the blue one. While the white one did its maneuvers, the blue one blinked out of view a couple more times, and after each would re-appear in a slightly different part of the sky, at a complete stop, but still within the area of the white one and its zigzag movement. After about a minute (60 seconds) of this, they both took off, the blue one slightly ahead of the white one, at what seemed to be the same altitude, in a due south direction. Needless to say, I was quite mesmerized by the performance I witnessed. I have provided contact information on the Report Form.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

Orange Lights/Fireballs above the Lake;2010-05-10 23:45:00;15 minutes;Orange Lights/Fireballs above the Lake Driving home late at night. Noticed orange lights/fireballs in the sky. There was road work so I had to detour around the lake.  The 2 orange lights/ fireballs weren't moving. They were high enough in the sky that even when I turned onto a different street I could still see them. As I was passing the lake I noticed that they were right above it. I felt like I couldn't stop staring at it but I didn't want to wreck my car either. I checked the road again and turned my head back to the lights and a third one appeared...a bit smaller than the other two. They were in a diagonal line.  As I made my turn right to get onto the road behind my house, a Helicopter flew over the large apartment builings on the left corner and flew straight towards it.  I drove really fast home and ran and told my boyfriend what I'd seen.  He looked out our bedroom window and said he could hear the Helicopter but he couldn't see it.  He actually got in his car and drove over to the lake ! but he said he saw nothing.  Even the Helicopter was gone. He's bummed because I saw something and he didn't.

The object then quickly disapeared as it was moving higher then just took off and was gone.  I know what planes look like and it was not a plane.

Multiple orange colored lights moving towards downtown Orlando, then ascended upwards and vanished.;2011-12-23 19:55:00;15 minutes;Multiple orange colored lights moving towards downtown Orlando, then ascended upwards and vanished. At approximately 7:55PM, I noticed what I thought was a commercial aircraft coming towards my house with its wings dramatically tilting from side to side...then eventually rotating clockwise as if it were in a barrel roll.  The two distinct lights eventually separated and continued to travel towards the ESE and gaining altitude.  Shortly after the lights separated, approximately 12 more lights came over the horizon following the same path.  At this point, I grabbed my camera to started taking photos.  After the main cluster of lights faded off at a much higher altitude than where they started, two more stray lights came over the horizon and followed the same path.  The entire event lasted around 15 minutes.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

Sometimes each group they would be in line, sometimes form a triangle and suddenly they all moved like bees in a hive.  There was no tail, like meteor shower, and they were very pale light blue, just like small stars.

The visibility was excellent during this time as I noticed a spherical light zipping through dark sky at a very high altitude.

They kind of liked zoomed in out of no where and just like they had zoomed in they were gone in a 5 minutes time span.   It had to have been around 10 ish or so maybe a bit earlier or later I just knew my fiance had to leave the home for work at 10:20 ish so it had to be around that time.

Large ball of light separates into three smaller light objects.;2012-12-29 17:50:00;45-60 seconds;Large &quotball&quot of light separates into three smaller light objects On the evening of December 29, 2012, at approximately 5:50PM,I was walking my dog down our street, heading in a west-southwesterly direction. The sun was almost finished setting, and the sky was mostly clear. As I was looking up into the sky, which I regularly do when dog-walking, I noticed a &quotstar&quot that was as bright as Venus, but in a different location. Venus, at that time of night, is almost directly due East. This light was on a south-southwest path in the sky...looking up, it was also about 70-75 degrees above the horizon. At first I thought it was coming towards me, and that the big light was the headlights of a jet.  Then I realized that it was going AWAY from me, and that the quality of the light coming from it was different to that of a jet headlight...more like it was lit from within.  With this understanding, the dog and I stopped in our front yard...I watched. As I looked on, the light object dimmed a bit, then, SPLIT INTO 3 separate smaller objects. Each one, though not as bright as the original, was also a ball of light. As soon as they were clearly separated from one another, they took off in 3 different directions...1 took a more southerly route, 1 went straight forward for a second then shot straight UP, and the third one banked sharply to the right (my right) and headed on a north-northwest trajectory.  The time that elapsed between separation and all 3 being no longer visible was about 15-20 seconds.

All other air traffic moved opposite direction, except 1 high speed plane that followed the same path a couple minutes later. They looked like flares, but instead of falling, were going up and moving North pretty rapidly. Way too fast to be flying lanterns.  Covered many miles in a matter of just a few minutes.

Orange sphere's in sky over Orlando, Florida that seemed interested in the planes nearby;2013-05-26 20:55:00;5 minutes;Orange sphere's in sky over Orlando, Florida that seemed interested in the planes nearby On May 26, 2013 at approximately 20:55 I had just arrived at my parents’ home in southeast Orange County, Florida.   As I was walking to the front door I looked to the North and saw orange lights in the sky.  It had been dark only for a little while but the lights were easily distinguishable and I knew that what I was seeing was out of the ordinary.  At first there were only four of them each following the same path as the one in front of it?   I immediately opened my front door and yelled for my mother to come out to see what was going on knowing that this was something never seen before.  I asked her to grab her phone so I could record what I was seeing.  My parents have lived in this home for something like 40 years and I grew up there.  They’re home is near the McCoy International Airport so there are planes coming and going in the eastern sky (literally) at all times.  I know what a plane looks and sounds like and these orange lights were moving much faster than ! any plane I have ever seen.  The orange light did not appear to be a beacon on the aircraft but it seemed to be the aircraft.  At one point one of the orange lights moved toward a plane traveling west from McCoy and came right up next to it, to what looked like a stone’s throw from it.  I don’t believe that any passenger plane would allow another plane to come that close or even a military plane over a civilian population.   As I was recording the strange lights they started to change direction from the north to south path to a direction due west and then one of them just disappeared, shortly after this another disappeared and then another until there was only one left.  The last orange light just kept heading west until I could not see it any longer and just as I stopped the recording another orange light appeared from the same spot as the other four.  It followed the same path as the previous four heading south until almost over top of me and then turning west until I could not see it any longer. I am not a UFO enthusiast, I don’t watch the skies for anomalies, and I have never seen anything like this before.  I was totally surprised at what I was seeing but I can tell you this, I knew right away that what I was seeing was something that had never occurred here before.  My words and even the video I took do not do justice for what I saw, it was quite amazing.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

When the hurricane was off shore last summer heading toward New England I was out side watching the storm clouds blowing over and I noticed lights passing behind these large trees.   I thought at first it was just one of the frequent blimps flying over.  After a few minutes the lights came out from behind the trees headed from east to west.   I watched these lights and noticed that the lights would be lite for a few secons then go Out.  Not all at the same time.  I watched for a while and more lights came out from behind the trees headed west.   These lights were strung out about 10-15 (from ground view) inches long and five accross and they were escorting a mother ship.  I called my grandson and his friend out (5th graders) to see the UFO's fleeing the hurricane.  They became afraid and ran into the house.   Neither will even speak about what they saw that night.

Single and silent yellowish light, traveling southwest to northeast below cloud cover, seen in northwest Orlando, Florida;2013-12-10 20:05:00;~1 minute;single and silent yellowish light, traveling southwest to northeast below cloud cover, seen in northwest Orlando, Florida At approximate 20:05 on December 10, 2013, just as I exited my work place, I looked up at the sky, generally towards the northeast and probably at an angle of about 70 degrees above the horizon, and saw a yellowish light, smaller than the current apparent size of Jupiter but bigger than most star, traveling at a steady speed, somewhat like a typical satellite but a bit faster, heading from the southwest towards the northeast below what appeared to be a relatively-low cloud overcast. I immediately attempted to confirm that it was an airplane, but no other lights or a structure was visible.  And if I recall correctly, the light did not appear to have the typical brilliance of aircraft lights, nor did it appear to be a craft just within the cloud layer, with its main light source diffused, and perhaps the other lights obscured, by the clouds, thereby giving it the appearance of a single light object it did appeared as one object, i.e., an object of light, and I am quite certain it was below the clouds and not passing through, or thinly veiled by, them so it was probably not the International Space Station.  It may have been a plane, but it seemed too close, below an overcast that was reflecting some of the ground-based lighting, for it not to have been discernible.  I did not perceive any sound emanating from it, either from the beginning of the observation, I felt uneasy as I intently watched this light/object and sensed I was possibly witnessing somet! hing not man-made.  The quality of the round or oval light brought to mind the descriptions of plasma radiating UFOs.  I kept a constant watch to note if it stopped and/or changed directions, or perhaps pulsed, but it simply continued on its steady pace, becoming dimmer as it became more distant until it finally disappeared below the tree line to the northeast.  The observation probably lasted less than a minute. I estimate the line of travel to have been a line passing through the Tampa Bay area, across the northern Orlando area, which is where I was, and on out to the Atlantic Ocean somewhere between the Kennedy Space Center and Daytona Beach.  Was it generally following the Interstate 4 corridor?;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

During this time I noted we could see the stars clearly in the sky, an airplane traveling from the South East to North West through and passed the red lights.  The interesting part was the red lights never blinked like the lights on the airplane and we noted that while the airplane was moving away from us we could still see it in the distance while the red lights completely disappeared at various points of the sky.  I did try to take a picture of the lights – un! successfully – the lights did not show up on my I-phone and subsequently did not show up on the pictures I took.  I suspect the lights were too small and too far away.  I am not sure if this is an actual UFO siting but thought it to be rather interesting and unusual experience for me and my friend.   There were two other people watching as the red lights cross the sky and multiple walkers in the park noticing the lights as we watched.  The total duration of the siting approximately 4 – 5 minutes.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

The front five moved into a geometric shapes and the gradually rose to the night sky and disappeared into the night sky among fireworks.  They were to close together for planes or helicopters and no sounds could be heard.  The other two followed to the high sky as well.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

In a White and orange color. Stops in the sky and takes a dive.  Starts going in circles and falling straight down and rapidly accelerated upwards.   As the it changed direction it also changed colors of blue, purple and red.  My son of 10 years of age was with me.   I hope someone else has seen this, as I was shaken and scared the rest off the night.  Afterwards the object disappeared rapidly downward.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

BIG BALL OF LIGHT DISAPPEARED INTO THE SKY IN FRONT OF ME AND MY SISTER.;2014-08-25 21:00:00;1:30 seconds;BIG BALL OF LIGHT DISAPPEARED INTO THE SKY IN FRONT OF ME AND MY SISTER Around 21:00, the sky is clear, there was not a cloud in the sky.  I was walking my dog on a plot near my house.  I live a few miles from Orlando International Airport, hence I see a lot of planes taking- off, landing and taxiing mainly.   A ball of light was sighted flying at a considerably lower altitude (above me) and had no aerial taxiway lights (since it was at altitude for landing).  At the same time I called my sister and asked her to leave the house to see also..  At that time I was running back home with my dog along to see my sister, since I needed another witness (was not the first ball of light that I see here in Orlando-Fl.)   Are looking at the ball together and the ball of light was flying at a constant speed and then the more strange happens, it begins to rise slowly..  We were able to see the ball of light getting farther up the point we saw the light gradually decrease until disappearing in the sky (remember that was not a cloud in the sky)   at the end of it, I was super excited to have been able to show someone more, and happier still to have been my sister (she's 21 )  I'm lover of planes, helicopters, RC’s planes/Helicopters and virtually everything that flies from when I was a child, so I know exactly what I saw was not any type of aircraft.  I thank everyone who took the time to read and also saw someone please write here also.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Blue and red light traveling rapidly above Orlando.;2015-01-09 23:00:00;20 seconds;Blue and red light traveling rapidly above Orlando. 3 of us were on a balcony in a high rise downtown and saw a blue and bright light rapidly traveling in and out of clouds, miles away.   The lights began moving up and down at an incredible speed, then seemed as if it touched the ground far away.   All of a sudden we all saw a bright red light now more than 1,000 feet in front of us and it all ended.   Really bizarre.

Very large, bright red object with secondary flashing green light below;2015-07-18 22:45:00;1 minute;Very large, bright red object with secondary flashing green light below Was getting out of my car after pulling into my backyard parking area near the downtown / Colonialtown area of Orlando.  Noticed a very bright red light above my house that appeared to look like a red light on top of a cellphone tower with secondary small green light underneath flashing.  I thought this strange since there are no towers nearby and one couldn't have been erected in 15 minutes before I went to the corner store.  I reached for my phone but the battery was dead.  I thought it was then perhaps a helicopter but there was no sound whatsoever.  The object then made a quick movement slightly to the north and stopped.  It then made a fast drop, like a stone, to the north west and got out of sight behind some trees. I ran out to the road and got a better view of it.  It continued its path almost out of sight behind trees and houses. on the horizon.  Before it slipped completely out of sight, it made a hard erratic 90 degree turn parallel to the horizon to the e! ast.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Saw 9 reddish/orange lights flying in very slow formation for approximately 2 before disappearing behind clouds.;2016-02-14 20:20:00;2 minutes;Saw 9 reddish/orange lights flying in very slow formation for approximately 2 before disappearing behind clouds. I was walking a dog in a neighborhood in Central Florida around 8:20pm.  I looked up and saw a light in the sky.  I almost dismissed it as an airplane, but looked again and realized there were several lights all very near to each other.  When I later counted there were nine in the photos and video.  The lights were reddish/orange and did not change.  There was no noise that would usually be associated with aircraft and they were moving very slowly.  They were only visible for a couple minutes before disappearing behind clouds.  I did not see them reappear after that. I was able to get two photos and a short video of the lights. Having spent several years in the USAF, I have personally witnessed aircraft that is capable of hovering and flying at very slow speeds, but I’ve never seen this many flying so close together in this kind of formation.  I am aware of a government facility of some kind nearby that is not on maps.  My husband and I made a wrong turn shortly after moving to the area and came upon a guarded gate.  We were told to turn around immediately or risk arrest, but when I looked on the map on my phone, the facility was not there. I’m not sure if these lights could somehow be connected to the government facility we stumbled across, but these certainly did not appear to be normal airplanes.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Odd white lights seen traveling westward from Colonial in Orlando.  Low, no sound.;2016-04-04 02:24:00;30 seconds;Odd white lights seen traveling westward from Colonial in Orlando.  Low, no sound. While driving westwards on Colonial/50 Monday morning, through Pine Hills, I saw what appeared to be three white lights arranged in a close point-up triangle.  It appeared to be a single object, moving roughly W-SW from over the highway, traveling in a straight line.   There were no blinking lights visible at all, and no sound, despite a significantly fast rate of travel at what appeared to be low altitude.  It is entirely possible it was a helicopter that turned southish at some point, having followed Colonial prior to my seeing it (helis launch from the Orlando business airport all the time),  however, it looked very odd for a helicopter.

Very bright white light following a southern trajectory seen 5 minutes prior to Falcon-9 launch from Cape Canaveral;2017-07-05 19:32:00;5 minutes;Very bright white light following a southern trajectory seen 5 minutes prior to Falcon-9 launch from Cape Canaveral I was heading out to my front porch, here in East Orlando, about 5 minutes prior to a Space-X Falcon-9 launch of the Intelsat 35e.  I am about 37-miles west of the Space X complex at Cape Canaveral, and can see the rockets quite clearly when they launch.  As I went out the door, facing east, I noticed a very bright light to the northeast rising upward, about a third of the way off the horizon, initially almost exactly the same speed and curved trajectory a rocket launch would follow to the southeast.  I was upset because I thought I had missed the initial launch.  I tried to shoot a digital movie of the bright light, but it did not come out as far as I can see.  I visually followed the light as it climbed and got smaller and smaller, finally vanishing at high altitude.  I was puzzled because the light was an intense white color, and usually rockets at low altitude display a bright orange flame, as I was thinking I had been watching the Falcon-9 launch, and I’ve seen many launches from the Cape over the last 10-years, and what I thought was the launch just didn’t add up.   A few minutes later, a 7:37 pm (1937 hours) I saw the bright orange flame of the Falcon-9 booster appear just to the southwest, as it climbed and started to leave a contrail as it went into the upper atmosphere.  What really puzzled me, is that I had the impression that the bright light seen a few minutes earlier had been moving a whole lot faster than the rocket after it gained some altitude, I’d say about 4-times faster.  I know they prohibit aircraft in the immediate launch area, and the bright light flew directly through it only a few minutes prior to the actual launch.  I thought maybe an Air Force jet had left the skid strip on afterburner or something, but I was in the Air Force and never saw an afterburner as bright as that.  It was odd, because I really thought I had been watching the launch, and only after I saw the actual launch did I find the whole episode strange.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Orangish-white light standing still and then flying off;2017-07-18 01:05:00;~2-3 minutes;Orangish-white light standing still and then flying off I was finishing reading late at night in my dorm room at UCF, and I looked outside and saw a very bright light that normally isn't there.  It was just shining and staying still for about a minute and then it moved left and grew dimmer once it started to move, until it went behind a building where I couldn't see it anymore.   Then a second bright whitish orange light appeared slightly off from where I saw the first one at, and flew off in a similar manner in an opposite direction.   The objects had their light arc off in random patterns, and stay, then change again, as they moved, but this didn't happen when they were still.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

Rapidly changing coloured light extremely dissimilar to aircraft lighting seen at airport.;2018-06-08 22:20:00;3-5 minutes;Rapidly changing coloured light extremely dissimilar to aircraft lighting seen at airport. 	I work at a major airport in the state of Florida as an airfield electrician.  I am used to, at this point, the general visual characteristics of aircraft lighting as it approaches and departs the airfield, especially since my job depends on being able to get out of the way for landing and taxiing aircraft. 	On 6/8/2018 at approximately 22:20 local, I stopped in one of our lighting vaults to use the facilities and wished to have a cigarette before going onto the field for the night's work.  This lighting vault is located on a less populated side of the field in a section of airport property that has not yet been developed.  As I stood there and observed various aircraft flying many miles from the field, my eyes were drawn to one light that was behaving EXTREMELY out of character for the lights of an aircraft.  It was rapidly changing colour between red, green, white, yellow and blue.  My first thought was that it looked similar to police lights at night with its rapidly changing colours.  Its approximate position was perhaps 3-5nm to my Northeast and it appeared to be slowly moving in my general direction, displaying inappropriate characteristics of motion for an aircraft.  I do not believe the changes in colour to be due to atmospheric effects because other aircraft were appearing normally as just a white point of light with the occasional strobe, even in the same general region of the sky.  After appearing to slowly move towards me, the object appeared to remain stationary in the air for some seconds before retreating in the distance and then appearing to dim and fade out rather than disappear below the horizon.  I made an attempt to photograph the object, however I only had a cell phone camera and was unable to see the point of light in any photographs taken. 	I work the night shift and have for the past year become well used to the appearance of large and small aircraft navigational lighting in positions from 20nm to 20 feet, furthermore I have become well used to the normal movement of aircraft on approach and departure and am well aware of the visual effects produced by their movement in relation to stars and other aircraft.  At the time of my encounter, I did not have an airband capable radio on my person, but as I returned to my truck about the time the object began to fade away, for lack of a better term, I did not hear any chatter in relation to it on the local control frequency though I admit I did not check with the various approach/departure frequencies. 	I am not sure what I saw, but I am sure that it displayed characteristics extremely dissimilar to aircraft lighting. ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) I'll look for it...though I own an LG 450 flip phone, by design. I am resisting the smartphone push until I cannot avoid it anymore. This was seen visually and I am usually aware about these things. The only mental explanation I can come up with is a rotocraft with amber and blue stroboscopic lights. I could be very wrong, but this is my explanation. ((END ADDENDUM #1)) ((ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS)) I checked out the same place at the same time and saw no object. All I can imagine it to be would be: 1-an aircraft with led approach lights passing through an atmospheric phenomenon causing it to twinkle 2-a rotorcraft with non standard blue and yellow lighting 3-an object that defies conventional explanation.

Oval light disappears in sky.;2019-06-20 10:30:00;5 seconds;Oval Light Disappears in Sky It is not the first time while driving I-4 passing Downtown Orlando towards Sanford I've seen this light  I was close to exit to Anderson area and the Oval light was I would say towards exit 101 or 104.  I know we have an airport nearby but this is just like no track once I see it I can't find again in the clear skies.  But yesterday, at 18:30, I witnessed it want wanted to let you guys know.  It's like an airplane size oval shape light that disappears after a few seconds.  Sometimes I keep looking thinking there is a cloud it goes into because that's the sensation that it goes into something in the sky but it just disappears.  I've seen this incident a couple of times this month.   I also noticed this around  17:00  in the Central Florida Parkway maybe a few months ago zip code 32821 facing north same exact shape bright, light shows and in a few seconds disappears as if it was going to a cloud but there is none.  In a way looks like a bigger version to what you ! will experience if you are having a huge migraine the little dots of light you see flashing but bigger like airplanes and only one that goes away in a few seconds by disappearing in the sky. It has been only one single light each time I see it.  I am always observing when I can and I spend 1 to 2 hours driving for commuting so I am aware of my surroundings and look up as well.  No rainy days on daylight all these occasions.  The sun is always to the right when I'm driving from I-4 Close to Conroy Road towards Daytona area.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

I looked up and seen a huge circle light. I yelled for my 10 year old daughter, “Look at that! Is that a star?” She looked up and we both watched the light at the stop sign and started. It looked silver and bright in a circle of light. It was higher up in the sky than a plane and it was too big to be a star in the distance. The sun was out and shinning. All of a sudden it just vanished! Gone! I drove and drove and pulled over to see if we could see it anywhere. It was just gone!
