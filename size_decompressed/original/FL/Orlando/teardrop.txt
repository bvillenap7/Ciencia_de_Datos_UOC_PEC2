It was very close to the aircraft and was silver or chrome in color.   I watched this craft until the jet flew out of sight.   It was mostly cloudy this day and the sun was not in my vision.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
White object vanished over Lake Jesup.;2014-03-31 09:30:00;5-7 seconds;White object vanished over Lake Jesup. I was driving across lake Jesup and saw what I thought was a bird high up in the sky (a white object), but the fact that it seemed to move right without flapping made me focus more on it.  Before too long it just vanish, not all at once but front to back (right to left).   This was freaky.   This was probably 12k feet in the air too.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
