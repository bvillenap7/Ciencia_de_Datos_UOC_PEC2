Brightly Flashing lights, loud sounding object  hovering over Orando.;2010-11-22 05:00:00;35 minutes;Brightly Flashing lights, loud sounding object  hovering over Orando. I was awaken by the sound of what I though was a helicopter. I looked out of my window and saw bright flashing red, green, and white lights. It was hazy out so I couldnt get a great shot of it with my camera. The cigar shaped object was hovering in the same spot for a whole 30 to 35 minutes.  It was very loud, but what got me was that it did not move.  I tried to explain it but just couldnt.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Bright Silver Disc with perfect circle of Distortion (Haze) around it;2013-11-10 15:29:00;15 seconds;Bright Silver Disc with perfect circle of Distortion (Haze) around it The Sky was clear Blue and I could not help but notice four fresh white Contrails up above, I was looking to the East, The Contrails were across the Sky from North to South. They looked as if they were just made, but I did not see or hear the Plane that made them,  As I was looking at the Contrails I noticed a  very bright white light moving in between the Contrails from South to North. It was shining as bright as a Star. As this light got closer I could see that it was a bright Silver  Disc, cigar shaped  from the side profile,  The altitude was about 300 Ft ,  The Disc was 25 to 30 Ft. in diameter,  It was moving in a straight direction from the South to North at about 200 MPH. I could see a distinct perfect circle of Distortion or Haze around the Disc as it went by,  There was no sound at at all,  This Event lasted for about 13 to 15 seconds. As I watched it pass by and go out of sight,  A minute or two went by and the Contrails faded away.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Large bright white object;2014-12-15 17:30:00;10 minutes;Large bright white object cigar shaped moved high above the tree line about 5:30 pm 12/15/14.  I first thought what a bright star as I am watching the sun set. But then I noticed that it was moving across the horizon ever so slowly.   I first caputured it facing south west and recorded it until it headed due west.  Light was so bright you could even see it through the clouds as it was passing through. in the clouds it also changed to oranges and reds.  Perhaps reflecting the sunset but unsure..   Then it slowly moved down and came down over the trees due west.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
One large and 3 smaller object in a clear sky;2015-06-24 15:15:00;20-25 minutes;One large and 3 smaller object in a clear sky While sitting in my pool, I was facing east, looking up at a beautiful blue sky, when I noted a bright white oblong object.  I stared at it, then seen a pin point of white light at about the 7 o'clock position from the larger object as I watched it it appeared another pinpoint of white light came near the other smaller light and then blinked out.   While watching these objects I looked to the lower right of the larger object at about the 4 O'clock position and noted another pin point of light.  At this point I was observing one larger object and the 2 pinpoints of light.  Occasionally the 4th would blink on by the one at the 7 O'clock position. I started to doubt what I was seeing thinking perhaps I was just looking a some debris's on the screening.  I got out of the pool and walked outside of the screen room and the objects were still there.  I went back into my seating spot in the pool and continued to watch for close to 25 minutes.   All of a sudden they all vanished in the blink of an eye.  I sat there for a while still looking up at the sky and then saw what I assumed to be the larger object higher in the sky but did not see the smaller objects. I will try an give some idea as to where the objects were using a structural beam of my screen room.  The beam is parallel to my patio approximately 10 feet off the deck.  I was sitting in my pool on a seat approximately 18 inches below the deck.  The large object appeared about 12 to 14 inches above this beam and appeared to be 3/8 of an inch long.   The object at the 7 o'clock position appeared to be about 3 inches below the larger object. The object at the 4 o'clock position was about 6 to 7 inches from the larger object.   I have watched shuttle and rocket launches at the cape from my backyard and the larger object seemed to be in that proximity. With the exception of one of the pinpoints of light all the others remained stationary.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Black object was moving slowly across the sky and did not look or move like anything I had seen in the sky before;2015-08-26 14:00:00;3-5 minutes;Black object was moving slowly across the sky and did not look or move like anything I had seen in the sky before While watching the Birds of Flight show at Disney World on August 26, 2015, I noticed a black object hovering in the sky.  The object was moving slowly across the sky and did not look or move like anything I had seen in the sky before.  It was taller than it was wide and did not display any distinct symbols. After watching it for about 30 seconds to a minute I was unable to indentify what it was but am certain it was not a plane.  It appeared to be either below the clouds or at cloud level because at one point a cloud passed behind it. Based on it movement it was maybe moving as fast as a hot air balloon does in the sky. It's speed or direction did not change while I was watching and I lost interest. I did look up a couple times after my initial siting to confirm what I had saw and the object was still there.  I did not however see what happened to the object.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

It was reddish orange on the top half and green on the bottom.  There looked to be another sliver of light behind just below it.  It hovered for approximately 10 seconds and then shot directly up at the speed of a shooting star and it disappeared.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Cigar shaped object hovering over The Orlando International Airport Florida;2020-02-16 02:30:00;4 minutes;Cigar shaped object hovering over The Orlando International Airport Florida We were leaving the Orlando Internationals Airport shortly after 2 pm.  I was the driver and noticed something completely still and hovering over the airport next to a dark gray cloud. I grabbed my passengers attention, which at this point the third passenger noticed it as well.  The object was a cigar shape, not in motion at all and using the cloud as it’s cover.  When the sun light hit the side of the craft, the object looked as if it was a mirror.  Once the sun went back behind clouds this object appeared to have a metallic color as if it was sparkling. Airplanes were crossing the same cloud and the colors were not the same. Nor size and movement!  Once we got closer in view, this object lowered itself inside the cloud almost like a covering, almost like a blanket to mask its location. Then it slowly hovered back out from the cloud only to completely disappear. There was sadly no footage taken as I was driving and my passengers were in the shame shock I was. It had no sound, no lights around it. Just a complete cigar shaped object that had the most impressive color I have ever seen. I have seen all types of air crafts, including weather balloons, blimps, helicopters, military crafts and NONE of us have ever seen anything like that! Especially the coloring/size and even how it was using the cloud to cover its whereabouts!  Truly incredible. I have seen UFO/UAP objects at night but never during the middle of the day over an airport. It was a first for all of us and truly one I won’t forget!;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
