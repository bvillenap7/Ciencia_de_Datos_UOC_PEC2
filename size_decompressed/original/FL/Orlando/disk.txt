Orlando, Pine Hills Disk;1971-04-05 18:00:00;2 Minutes;Orlando, Pine Hills Disk As a child in the early 70's (date in report is approximate), I was playing kickball with my friends in the street in the Pine Hills area near what is now Meadowbrook Middle School.  All of a sudden, the girls started screaming and pointing at the sky.  Looking up, I observed a disk shaped UFO with two rows of blinking light panels located on the bottom and around the perimeter of the disk.  I distinctly remember that as an inner panel glowed an outer panel was illuminated and vice versa.  The panels turned on and off in a checkerboard pattern continuously and almost appeared flourescent.  I say almost because no bulb was observed, either directly or as if hidden behind an opaque or transparent cover--the entire panel glowed evenly with no observable concentration of light.  The craft traveled from south to north no more than 50-60 feet above our heads.  It moved very slowly, in complete silence, and then disappeared behind dense trees (what is now the area immediately south of North Lane in Pine Hills).  The Orlando International Airport was a SAC strategic bomber base at the time and, as an adult, I now believe that the craft was somehow connected with the base.  I have no evidence to back that supposition.  I find it interesting to note that a 1966 report and a 1976 report on this site also note glowing light panels.

Large disc shaped with light panels around the edge of this disc;1976-07-15 20:00:00;10 mins;Large disc shaped with light panels around the edge of this disc This event occurred during the summer of 1976.  I was vacationing in Orlando, staying at my grandparent house.  I had set up a tent in the backyard next to the pool and was next to the tent drying off after the last swim of the day..when all of a sudden, I noticed a large disc shaped saucer approx 50 ft above my grandparents neighbor's house.  There were light panels (I don't remember the colors) around the edge of this saucer.  There was no viewing bubble..or window on top of this disc..you know, what flying saucers are normally described as..but as the disc just seemed to float there...I felt no fear..just curosity.  I walked through the house and into the front yard..and then noted that the disc seemed to jump in the sky to the left..and then head south in another leap..out of sight and in an instant.  This viewing has always made me curious of what is truly out there..People have dismissed it as an angel or someother type of supernatural being...But I have always been curious.

Flying saucer outside of Orlando, Florida summer of 1977;1977-07-15 21:00:00;15 minutes;Flying saucer outside of Orlando, Florida summer of 1977 I was nine yrs old and on a family vacation outside of Orlando, Fl heading for Disneyworld. It was dark and we were on a highway when my mother asked my father if he saw the thing in the sky. It was definetly a saucer shape. We pulled over by the side of the road. It was hovering next to a big builiding many stories high. It had colored lights on the bottom of it going around the craft. The craft was larger than the circumference of the building. There was a small plane flying around it. The craft made no noise. We had a CB radio in the car and each time it got close to the car the CB radio would get full of static. We watched it for 15 minutes or so and continued to drive. Not sure if we lost sight of it because we drove out of range or because it flew away.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

A object appears over tree top one night.;1997-06-15 01:00:00;25minutes;A object appears over tree top one night. A friend a I where hunting wild hogs one evening. We were running dogs all night and stopped at the end of a road in the woods about a 1/2 mile or so off the bee line express way. It was early morning around 1 am or so. We were sitting down smoking a cigarette when I looked up and ask my friend what that was in the sky. The stars were everywhere but one was quite bigger than the rest it was blue and had to be four times larger than any other star. I started flashing my maglight at it. For about 5 minutes. Then it just took off and went to the size of all the other stars in a matter of seconds with 4 or 5 littler red lights following it. It just stayed there after that. I told my friend that was really wild . We couldnt see the red ones after they took off but I could still see the same blueish star that was much closer just a few seconds ago. My friend was just blowing it off but I knew anything we had couldnt have moved like that. We sat there for about  fifteen to twenty minutes talking then my friend wanted to go home which was a bout a mile away. So we started walking back I heard a hovering sound I will never forget wasnt loud just different. I turned around and Saw a red shape above the tree tops at the end of the pasture It had a star like light below about 50 feet and it just stayed perfectly still. Then without a change in sound it just moved left then right. It was big It was cigar shaped the light below it moved like it was part the craft but you could tell it wasnt attached. We never heard it approach or seen anything around it just appeared out of no where. I wanted to walk to the tree line where it was but wouldnt go alone and my friend just wanted to get out of there. So we walked through the woods back to his place. When we got to his house we looked over in that direction and you could see a light a little smaller than a dime red in tint with a light just below it. It is very hard to put into words what we actually saw that night but believe me it wasnt right. It took me this long to w! rite abo ut it. but it was like it happened yesterday. I never believed the stories about ufo sightings until this happened to me. To me there is no other explination for it. You can try and say it was something man made but you were not there to see what I saw.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
A genuine craft not of manmade origin unless holograhic.;2002-05-05 13:00:00;1 minute;A genuine craft not of manmade origin unless holograhic. As result of Jenning's derisions as to the improbability of actual alien craft operating on this planet, will share the following, which I reported to NASA and the Police, back when I saw it.  I was driving a tractor/trailer, (Automobole Transporter), southbound on I-4,south of downtown Orlando. As I came to an overpass, I saw at the extreme East side of the overpass a UFO, that had apparently moments before lifted off the ground, because it was very low and moving slowly.  I got on the radio and said, Does anybody see that?, and there was no reply.  I worked it out in my mind as to what it could be other than what it appeared to be, and there was nothing of manmade origin that it could be other than some kind of holographic projection from an aircraft or satellite. It appeared to me to be approximately 35FT in diameter. And it was not shiny, nor illuminating light. In fact it was the exact opposite of the typical UFO story, the craft was a color of beige, brownish red. It was sporting and shotrt strut like antenae, that had about a 80 degree bend at the elbow.  Also, the harder I looked at it the harder it was to see it in crystal clear clarity, it was as if there was some kind of energy field around it. There existed a certain blurr to it, though not to the point of obscuring it. Again, this is in broad day light and it is at low altitude. The craft actually passed over me, movong from my left to my right.  I exited off at the next exit and saw it still. It was moving along I-4 toward Orlando. There were condo units that it was moving toward. The whole thing was unbeliveable because it moved low and slow, (i.e., 50 mph?). It move higher than when I first saw it, which is why it appeared to me to have just lifted off. The area where it would have lifted off from is woody.  I have no strange tales of alien abduction to share, nor  seeing at little green men. I saw what I saw, and it was real, not imagination, and not man made.  Remarkably, I attempted to write it off as anything but what it was.  Barring a holograhic projection, it was an alien craft of unknown origin.  The antenae was the same color as the rest of the craft.  It was by trying to see the see the detail of the antenae, that was on the side of the upper part of it, that I first decerned that it possessed a blurr to it, as if it emanted an energy feild of some sort. and it was just enough blurr to obscure 100 percent visual acuity. The color was odd to me for is contrary to typical UFO sightings? Was it camouflage? It's color closely resembled typical Florida roofs and ground terrain. Not much is it? But it is what I saw. No big deal. What I found interesting in retrospect is that it apparently did not give two bits for our interdiction capabilities, it was was low, slow, and in your face. Always thought if I ever saw a UFO it would be at night, never did I ever believe that I would see one like I did, in broad daylight near a major city.  35 ft. diameter does seem conducive to what we know of the requirements for interstellar flight, so where does it come from?  To me, in truth, man is technologically speaking, retarded. What we think is laughable. For here is a craft that defies the intellect of our monkey scientists, who would say it does not exist because our understanding prevents it's existence.  Apparently, the occupants of the the craft I saw possess a different viewpoint.  Most scientists are waking talking  boobs that are indoctrinated in schools of learning from our masters, and therefore possess no independent thought.  They are unable to think beyond the confines of what they were rotely taught, and as such - a typical scientist is a boob.  So spare telling me what I saw was impossible because it defies are science??????   And then these self appointed scientist rubes will say because it defies our monkey science then it must have been imagined?  There is a lot of truth to the original, Planet of the Apes.   Peter Jenning's is one of the temple apes apparently.  By the way, shortly thereafter I purchased a camera phone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

Large ufo sighting in Orlando, Fl.;2013-08-13 19:25:00;40 seconds;large ufo sighting in Orlando, Fl On 8-13-13 at 19:25 hrs, I was coming home from work (law enforcement officer) and traveling north on state road 417.  I was on a motorcycle.  I saw departing and arriving aircraft because I was approx. 6 miles away from Orlando International.   To my right, away from the jet traffic, I saw an unusually bright saucer shaped object at appx 1,500 to 2,000 feet.  It was farther away from the airline traffic and was still 4 to 5 times larger than the jets.  It was immense.   I said to myself no way! there were no navigation lights, markings of any kind.   I pulled over and removed my sunglasses, and it darted east incredibly fast and then went straight vertical and was gone in a few seconds.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Disk shape floating going up and down. Lights changed from green to red.;2014-04-13 01:45:00;4 minutes;Disk shape floating going up and down. Lights changed from green to red. I was sleeping and my husband was coming back from work.  Not sure if it was around 1:30am or 2:00am. He said he saw something changing colors and going up and down. We live close to the airport for about 14 years and we are used to airplanes, but the object was not like an airplane, it did not move as an airplane, did not sound like it. I went outside with him and I saw when it came up from behind the tree and it did not went up too high (lower than an airplane route). It was not too big, disk shape and the lights were underneath it.  The colors of the lights were green (like a traffic light).  The part where the lights were I could see rotating.  Not sure if the lights were turning off one after another or if the entire set of lights were rotating so fast that it gave me the impression that it was turning off in sequence. No sounds whatsoever. It went down again and within a minute it went up again but now the lights were red (again like the red on the traffic light). The object floated on air each time for about 30 seconds and went down.  We waited for a couple of minutes and we went inside. We live near Gatlin and Semoran on Orlando, FL, and there is a park on Gatlin with lots of green space. I'm thinking it was trying to lend there. Fabulous experience.  I did not went back inside to get the camera cause I did not want to miss the appearance.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

I went out to my patio at around 19:45, it was still light out.  There was a big cloud outline of a saucer, it wasn't completely covered.    A few minutes later the cloud outline completely disappeared.  It didn't change shape or drift away like clouds do, it completely went from white to blue like the sky.   When that happened, a faint outline of a saucer remained.   I soon went to bed and never woke once, don't remember a thing.

On 07/31/15 at approximately 11:10 PM I decided to go out and check to see if the night sky was clear enough to observe the Blue Moon.;2015-07-31 23:00:00;2-3 minutes;On 07/31/15, at approximately 11:10 PM, I decided to go out and check to see if the night sky was clear enough to observe the Blue Moon effect that was supposed to take place that evening.  So, I grabbed my dog and proceeded out the front door of my house, and no sooner did step out and looked up at the night sky that had some slight overcast, did I notice to the south/east sky some sort of slow descending craft with four extremely bright round white lights.  It momentarily stopped and all of a sudden the four white lights began to randomly blink. Needless to say, at that point, I'm starting to freak out, looking for anyone that I could find to witness what was going on, while still keeping my eyes on the craft.   Then all of a sudden the craft while stationary makes a quarter turn to the right clockwise and there were four more lights the same size but these were all red in color emanating the same brightness, and they began a random blinking as well. From my left peripheral view I caught sight a commercial air liner descending and approaching in on its flight path for a landing into Orlando International Airport (MCO) which is approximately four miles south from this location.  That was when the craft started descending straight down at this time and it felt as if it was avoiding the airliners pathway. It slowly descended out of my view behind some tree tops and houses and I would guess about maybe three to five blocks away at most.  That was when I made a dash into the house for my point & shoot digital camera, phone and car keys and decided to search out what exactly this craft was.  My first thought was, it was some sort of expensive really big hovering drone and surely I would be able to track who ever was flying it while they were packing it away, but I found nothing so I extended my search even further out than I anticipated and still nothing.  I drove back to the main road SR 436 hoping to catch some people perhaps gathered talking about the lights but there also I found no one... Approach and descent of craft:  From the S/E sky, heading S/W.   Speed:  Slow.   Approximate size:  Ten feet plus in diameter.   Shape:  disk like.   Lights:  Four per quarter side (but could only see two sides of craft)  Color of craft:  N/A  Sound or Humming:  None (and it was a really quiet night)  Height in the sky of craft:  Just below the over cast at the time of descent. Side notes:  There was also a smaller solid blue light off to the bottom side of the craft. ((name deleted)) Orlando, FL.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Disk object with silver dome sighted over Orlando interstate;2015-12-11 09:30:00;10 seconds;Disk object with silver dome sighted over Orlando interstate. While driving east bound on I-4 near the 434 exit, I saw in the sky a disk that had a reflective dome on top, at first I thought it was a plane turning and its wing was lifted up but as I watched the object didn't move and the reflective dome disappeared to leave just a disk shape sitting there for about 10 seconds then it just disappeared.   There was not a cloud in the sky so I know it didn't fly away.  That is what made me realize it was not normal.  This was a Friday morning and there was a lot of traffic on the road so I believe someone else must have seen this too.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
