We looked at it for a few minuites and then ran home. The odd thing was, my brother and I made it home in what seemed to be only seconds and we did not know what the time frame was from runningto being home. I never told anyone about this except you.

Old photo recently found with object in it;1984-06-01 12:00:00;unknown;Old photo recently found with object in it I recently reviewed old family photos from when I was growing up.  One photo out of the many in succession stood out.  It was taken at Epcot Center in Orlando, Florida.  There appears to be an object in the photo that was not in any other photos.  It is a small dark object that was not noticed until just recently that seem to have appeared and disappeared as fast as one photo to the next.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

I didnt think she believed me ...but that next night she told me she saw the local news reporter telling it on local tv....just want to know if anybody wants to know what it looked like up close?

Star like object high in the eastern sky appeared stationary, thought it was a planet, but then shot out into space toward the NNE leav;1999-02-19 04:45:00;1.5 min;Star like object high in the eastern sky appeared stationary, thought it was a planet, but then shot out into space toward the NNE leaving a short sparkle trail. I am a 39wmm professional construction consultant. I exited my front door at 4:45am on 2/19/99 to meet my neighbor to go offshore fishing that day. I ussually star gaze while waiting for him to show. I also can see rocket and shuttle lauches directly out my front door which faces due east toward port canaveral. This object did not fit that pattern nor was it in the appropriate location which is always ENE of my perspective, nor did it act like a meteor which i also enjoy watching while night fishing or during meteor showers. I also live near the Orlando airport so i have seen plenty of aircraft.  I noticed this object high in the eastern sky ESE of my perspective. It resembled the brightness of a planet on a clear night but slightly brighter and larger than venus. Its light appeared to pulse a bit more than i have seen in stars or planets in varing atmospheric conditions so i stared at it for just over a minute. As i was looking at it, it shot off into space leaving a blaze trail (sparkle trail) as if leaving the upper atmosphere. As the trail ceased the brightness of the object faded the object appeared much smaller but continued on into space until i no longer could see it, not beyond the horizon just due to its distance. At the point of vanishing it was still high in the east but ENE of my perspective.  I told my neighbor of this sighting as soon as he came over I also told one of my employees that evening when we came back from fishing as well as a few associates in the next few weeks afterwhich time i though it best to keep it to myself.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Circle cruised over head in mid after noon.;2000-11-12 14:00:00;5 seconds;Circle cruised over head in mid after noon. it was a beutifull clear blue day today.  i layed on in a lawn chair beside my pool in the sun to warm up a little.  i proped my hands on my chin with my fingers locked to shade my face and eyes from the sun.  i staired off into space and watched the ocasional hawk or buzard fly over head at a couple hundred feet. the ocational insect would zip by at about 20 ft. then a circle.  the circle was preaty non discript.  the sky was compteaty sky blue with no clouds. it was a bright day with lower than average humidity and no detectable haze. i only use the term circle because its color matched the back ground sky and icould not see any 3 dementional shape.  its hue at the edges was the only reason i saw it.  i did not know how big it was so i could not tell how far away it was and vice versa.  if it was the hight of the insects i saw fly bye it was moving increadibly slow, like a hover, and was between 2 and six inces acros. if it was the hight of of the hawk/buzzard it moved beteen five and ten times as fast as the bird and was between 8 inches and 3 feet. if it was the hight of a comercial pasenger jet it moved around 2 to 5 times as fast as an air plane and was same size or twice the size. it had no blinking strobe as air planes do.  it came in to my view just about over head.  it was moving when i caught glemps of it and it maintianed its spead for the 3 to 5 second duration.  it moved in a strait lign to the WNW. as it moved from over head its contrast in hue lessend untill i could no longer distinguish it from the uniform background at about a 60 degrea angle fron the horison. i live about 5 miles fron an air port. its line could be traced back in that general direction. there were no plains, birds or insects in my field of view with the object.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
I saw something......then I felt something;2003-06-28 21:15:00;45 minutes;I saw something......then I felt something Around 915 that night me and my wife were outside by the pool at the hotel. We had been out there for maybe 5 minutes. I was sitting in a lounge chair that lays back. I dont know why but for some reason I looked up. I know what I saw was not a plane or lights off some gas ball. There were 5 circles in the sky. Each one was a off white color. They did'nt move they did'nt blink they just sat there. But they were'nt by them selfs. They were hooked to something else. The circles were in a circular pattern, as if they were attached to something. They were about 5 feet from one another. But you could see them clear.....it was'nt a plane! Those lights were attached to the left side of some kind of craft. I told my wife to look at it. When she saw it she got a little scared and went inside. I stayed out there for maybe 15 more minutes. When I got to the upper part of the hotel I looked out over the rail. They were gone......just like that....gone no noise..nothing. Well when I went inside my wife did'nt really wont to talk about it. Later on that night I would say around 315 am. I woke up to a very bright light outside the hotel window. I got up and looked out the door. It was so bright when I opened the door you could'nt even see the parking lot. I dont remember much after that....not even going back to bed. But the next morning I woke up with a cut in the middle of my arm. Not a big cut, but a cut. It was'nt there when I went to bed. Well after comeing back home the cut stayed on my arm for about 2 weeks. Did'nt scab up....did'nt bleed...nothing. Then the next morning it was gone! No scar...nothing. I have never had any trouble with my body before that night. But ever since I saw what I saw. Ive had bad headaches...and my right arm goes num. I know it sounds stupid but it's the truth. I belive something happened that night.....what I have no idea. But what ever did happen, it feels like I got part of it....if you would like to email me feel free to. No one else belives me....but it's the tru! th.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Bright moving stars/objects over central Florida on 8/26/2003 about 9:03pm;2003-08-26 21:03:00;about three min.;Bright moving stars/objects over central Florida on 8/26/2003 about 9:03pm On Tuesday August 26, 2003 aorund 9:00pm, in N.W. Orlando, Florida.  I was standing outside of my garage at my apartment complex.  After working on my motorcycle I went to the front of the building and was standing by my people mover (my car), took a deep breath and gazed off into the distant sky viewing the stars above.  I was looking to the north at two stars, one a little brighter then the other.  I noticed that the brighter star seemed to be moving/dropping below and to the left of the dimmer star the brighter star was as still as the dimmer one before it started moving.  I thought my head was spinning so I looked down and looked back to see if it was me.  It was not, the moving star/object continued to move downward, then the star/object got very bright, a very bright white with a hint of blue, it became brighter then any other star in the sky.  The star/object moved towards the north and faded out of sight, not at an extremly fast rate but at a faster rate then any airplane I have ever seen, and it was at a very high altitude.  I had to stop and ask myself, what did I just witness.  I started laughing and told myself, no that was the after burner of a military jet, then I looked towards the NE and saw a second very bright star, and the same event happen but this one seemed closer to the horizon and closer towards me.  It became brighter then the first one, again a very bright white, it moved off towards the NE.  I am very sure that what I saw was not a military jet. What I saw moved unlike any plane I have ever seen and I have seen most if not all of them as my father was in the AirForce for twenty five years and so we always saw the jets in action.  I really hope that someone else had witnessed the same event that I had. I am a 44 year old male stable and sober, self employed father of three, just moved to the Orlando, FLorida area.

An object in the north sky moved downward and eastward emitting a red and blue trail at high speeds lasting four seconds.;2005-11-01 00:50:00;four seconds;An object in the north sky moved downward and eastward emitting a red and blue trail at high speeds lasting four seconds. I was in my driveway as I was returning home, when I saw an object in the north sky descend in a direct line.  The object caught my attention because it was bright and had a bright trail behind it.  The descent lasted approximately one second.  The object then stopped its downward linear motion and at a 90 degree angle began going from right to left across the sky at speeds I have never seen. This motion lasted approximately 3 seconds.  The object, at that time, had my full attention therefore, I noticed a blue and red trail.   At the conclusion of the three seconds that it moved from right to left across the sky, it vanished from sight along with its trail almost instantly.

So there probably were no other whitnesses. I looked up and it was probably atleast one mile wide. There was a light at the bottom that had scanned the land I was on!  It went straight into my eye than it moved a little.  I did not want to leave my post, to risk losing the UFO.  Than just a second later the UFO flashed and disapeared from eyes at the speed of light! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

UFOs in a V formation over Orlando, Fl.;2011-01-01 00:30:00;15 minutes;UFOs in a V formation over Orlando, Fl. At approx. 12:30 am on January 1, 2011 as I was in Orlando, Fl star gazing, I observed a formation of UFOs flying just north of the Orion constellation and west bound at a high rate of speed and at a extremely high altitude, As I focused my attention on the formation, I could make out approx 6- 7 individual crafts. They appeared to be in a V or backwards check formation. There were two crafts to the right of the center or lead craft and four on the left side. As I continued my observation, it appeared that the formation was gaining altitude as the lights were beginning to fade. The lights completely faded out where I could no longer make out the individual crafts and it now appeared as a large glowing orb. This continued for approx. for 5 more minutes until it to faded from view. The entire incident lasted for approx. 15 minutes.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

When I saw it again, the object moved again instantly to the east, then north moving behind another cloud.

They moved and hovered like helicopters. To Whom It May Concern:  On Saturday, April 7, 2012, at approximately 10:15 P.M. EST, I witnessed objects that quickly appeared, it seems, out of nowhere.  My first reaction was, Are we getting attacked?  However, I didn't hear anything.  Then, the objects slowed down.  They were circular and surrounded by lights, which looked like magenta.  Then, one by one, groups of them made a turn and disappeared.  The picture I finally took are what I call the stragglers.  By the time I took a picture, there were only a few left.  There were cars on the road.  I put the window down and pointed to the sky.  Not sure if anyone really looked up.  I can only surmise that I am not the only one who saw the objects.  They really were not that high in the sky. The following is what I submitted via website to Orlando International Airport in April 9, 2012:  I was at Lake Buena Vista last night (Saturday, April 7).

Reddish orange glowing orbs flying in formation in Orlando at about 9:30 PM April 29, 2012;2012-04-29 21:30:00;3-4 minutes;Reddish orange glowing orbs flying in formation  in Orlando at about 9:30 PM April 29, 2012 At about 9:30 pm, My family and I were on our way home after dinner at Tibby's in Winter Park.  We had gone to Winter Park to shop at the Whole Foods supermarket there. Right after passing the intersection of Lake Underhill and Econlockhatchee Road, travelling South on Econlockhatchee Rd., heading to home in Orlando, Florida , we saw a car in front of us pulled ooff the road on the right with its lights still on, door open and 2 young men outside the car. I was looking to see what they had pulled off for, and as we passed I saw that one person had either a camera or phone pointed up at about a 45-50 degree angle in front of him. It was odd because it was dark and all that was in front of him at that angle would be either a fence, a house's rooftop or the sky. So I was rubbernecking, then some lights caught my attention in the dark sky, in the direction where he was pointing his camera/phone at (West of us). I saw a line of a number of glowing reddish orange glowing orbs, lighter and bright at the center, lined up in an arc formation moving from left to right and up, in the sky. I shouted out to my family to look, look, look, a line of strange reddish lights. I realized why the people had pulled off and what they must have been taking pictures of. My husband who was driving, also saw the lights I was shouting about and pulled off the road too. We were now ahead of the other car, with their headlights facing us. My husband and I got out of the car and watched, calling our daughter to come look. She did, but seemed scared and hesitant. None of us recognized what they could be, orb shaped, with that reddish orange glow, brighter and lighter in the center. It was obvious to us that they were not planes from how they looked, moved, lined up and disappeared. There was also a plane flying in the opposite direction toward them off to the right, likely intending to land at the airport in that general area.. They were moving up and rig! ht and were disappearing one by one as they moved to the far r! ight. Th e largest was about the size of a pea the distance. My daughter couldnt get her iphone camera to work properly as she frantically tried to get a shot, she says it froze but managed to get a picture, though thee photo looks very red in color.   The lowest one was largest and as they moved up to the right they were either smaller or farther, then disappeared one at a time. There were about 3 lower down and 2 up to the right. I don ' t know if there were more or not before we saw them since they were fisappearing. The people in the orher car had left. I only indicated 3 who saw this, counting only my family though I know at least 2 other strangers saw it as well. I wondered if the people in the plane did also. Eventually all disappeared. We went home, somewhat in shock and a little scared. I figure I would be the last person at this site reporting this but it just happened and we all saw it, though I am still having trouble processing what we saw, and wondering what people will think when or if I tell them.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Three small white orbs flying erratically extremely high in a perfectly blue sky during broad daylight.;2012-05-10 16:00:00;8 minutes;Three small white orbs flying erratically extremely high in a perfectly blue sky during broad daylight. I was laying down on the back of my truck, looking at the clouds.  It was a beautiful day, the sky was bright blue. I was watching birds flying by and then I began looking at the vast blue of the sky.  As my eyes adjusted to changing depths, an object caught my eye. It was a very small white orb. It appeared to be either emitting its own light, or reflecting the Sun's.  This is because it kept a constant color. At first I thought it might be a star or planet, since I'm quite unexperienced with object of the sky. However, the longer I watched it, the more I realized how high in the sky it actually was.  This was in contrast to passing planes, which looked very small from my perspective, and were still obviously lower than the object.  I know this because at one point, the object moved behind some clouds that were passing by.  At this point I really noticed how erratic its movement was it slowed down and sped up it was also moving in different directions. As I was! watching this first object, I saw another one very close to it.  This one was moving much faster in the same direction as the first one, and there was yet another one following that one at the same speed.  It appeared as if the third one was chasing the second one, as they were moving erratically. After around 8 minutes, they were all completely covered by a passing cloud, and by the time it passed and I could see the blue background again-  I had lost all sight of the orbs. Keep in mind all of this was occurring at a very high altitude and in a very small zone of the sky, as the objects looked extremely small from ground level. Although the objects were moving extremely fast (much faster than any airplane that was passing by AND they were farther up), they were not making a scene. I myself have near perfect vision and unless I was concentrating perfectly on the level of altitude they were in, they would blur away and disappear. It happened a few times if I looked in another direction, finding them again was a matter of focusing on very small spots on the sky and looking for motion in the peripherals. This leads me to believe that UFOs are more common than we think during the day, yet they are so difficult to spot. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I observed about 9 or 10 balls of light going to one central destination.;2012-11-10 18:30:00;20 minutes;I observed about 9 or 10 balls of light going to one central destination On a sat around 18:30 hrs my friend just happened to walk outside.  She was outside for about 3 mins and then she brought something to my attention.  She has a puzzled confused look on her face as she pointed up into the night sky and questioned what are those orange reddish glowing balls.  I then took a good look and came to a conclusion that they weren’t several things.  Such as candles, air planes, dragon fly’s.  I knew that they were something odd.  I had already had my camera with me at the time and I soon then called my parents out to determine what they were.  My dad gazed up into the sky to further examine what they were.  At the time all of this was taking place there was a sudden stop of air traffic.  I live right by an air port so planes are coming in and out at all hours.  I notice that there were only two dots side by side heading towards the clouds going east to west.  During this time I soon began to capture everything on camera because I knew you would ha! ve to see it to believe it.  And then a swarm of 5 or 6 followed it in the same path after it disappeared.  After that 1 more came right along in the same direction I closely examined it through my camera lens and I noticed that the orange light started to dim and right in the center was a orange reddish dot.  I took a closer look of the whole thing and I saw a clear  3D outline of what looked like the whole thing.  The best way I am can describe them is floating orange jelly fish.

2 orange balls of flickering light moving slowly, in a line across the night sky, at low altitude, moving without making a sound.;2012-12-31 20:35:00;1 - 2 minutes;2 orange balls of flickering light moving slowly, in a line across the night sky, at low altitude, moving without making a sound. Walking my dog, and looking south in the sky, a flickering orange object caught my eye. It was moving slowly in a straight line, coming from the south to the north, about the height of a low flying helicopter, but with no sound.  A second identical flickering orange ball then appeared and followed in the same path, moving from the south to north.  Both followed the same line and stayed at the same altitude, and then turned towards the west.  The first slowly faded away and then the second one followed.  The objects were orange, circular in shape, with a flickering type of light, very bright orange.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

An object caught my eye moving at a fast rate of speed (equivalent to a car driving by you at about 35 40 mph) coming out of the tree line. It was going N to S. I would say it was about 300 to 400 ft in the air.  Circular in shape and size similar to a traffic light lens. It was a green neon bright color and solid.  I reached for my phone in my pocket to get ready to film and I observed a tracer or tail emit from the object about 15 feet out same color. It went another 20ft in that shape and imploded emitting 2 or 3 small balls from it almost like a roman candle and then just disappeared. Almost as if it exploded or hit something. It never changed it's flight pattern or height so it's hard for me to believe it was a shooting star. Specifically because of its size and color.  The green neon color was amasing looking and a color I don't see some one could recreate. ! Witnessed another sighting several months ago that I reported, I will tell you this one had my heart pounding. Spectacular to see.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Round Ball of light emitting &quotsparks&quot/light hovering in Orlando, Florida;2013-08-07 20:30:00;1-3 minutes;Round Ball of light emitting sparks/light hovering in Orlando, Florida. On August 7th, 2013 in Orlando, Fl, I was swimming at twilight around 8:30 pm and a bright, round object captured my sensory perception due to the amount of light that was emanating from it. It had a trail of smoke from beneath as if it was launched from the ground, but it was hovering for a few minutes and spark-like lights were falling from it toward the earth. Three other people responded to my statement of “What is that?” and all saw the object as well. I did not have a recording device nor camera and have never considered UFO’s before.  I am a neutral observer. I do live near Cape Canaveral so that came to my mind, however this object was hovering still for quite a while and was not directly above the Cape. ((NUFORC Note:  A launch of a Delta IV rocket from Cape Canaveral occurred at 20:29 hrs. on this date.  PD));28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

After around 10 seconds flying in my direction, it stopped, so i pulled over and got out of my car to look at it.   While I'm watching it two smaller crafts (also orange, not as bright) come out of the first bigger flying object and start flying in zig zag, changing directions extremely fast.  After around 30 seconds i lost sight of the two smaller crafts and went back to focusing on the bigger one, and out of nowhere, the light went out instantly, in fractions of a second.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

It was completely still and had spot lights on the bottom of the craft.  It had some sort of symbols on the bottom of the spacecraft. It was hovering over a neighborhood above houses also.  The symbols were very distinctive.  Almost like two lightning bolts crossed, or swastikas of some sort.  That's the only thing I can compare it to. I turned around and it had disappeared.  It was incredibly large and very low.  It seemed to be right above the trees. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.  PD);28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

Straight path towards northwest direction seemed to vanish or fade looked back to the moon saw another one exact same path it too seemed to fade looked back thinking that planes do not take off that close together and that exact path saw another and in all I saw 7 may have been more before I went outside.  Some did not fade at the same spot.   Thought maybe firework haze made them appear to fade but I don't think  so.

An identified object in the sky with a bright light hovering right above moon before a major category 3 hurricane (Irma).;2017-09-09 20:00:00;30 minutes;An identified object in the sky with a bright light hovering right above moon before a major category 3 hurricane (Irma). On the night of September 9, 2017, around the evening hours of 8-9, I went to take a photo of an eerie moon peaking and hiding behind clouds.  It was a calm breezy evening, basically the calm before the storm.  When I took the photo, it was the night before the great hurricane Irma.  Central Florida (East Orlando) where the photo took place was forecasted to be hit pretty bad by the hurricane on September 10, 2017, in the am hours into Monday morning September 11, 2017.  The photo I took the evening of September 9 showed an eerie moon and a bright light right above the moon in the sky.  When I took a picture of the moon with my cell phone camera I noticed the bright light above the moon. Living North of OIA Orlando International Airport, I see actual planes or helicopters all the time and this image did not look like anything I could identify in normalcy.  As you zoom into the picture the bright light has almost a mushroom shape on top. Interestingly, the area of Central Florida where I live was supposed to be pummeled by the storm, but fortunately my neighborhood and the adjacent neighborhood had minimal damage.  Some downed trees and general debris from wind.  It almost seemed that what I saw that evening in the picture (possible UFO), contributed some how to lessened damage within the radius of where the object could be seen in relation to the hurricane.  I will attach the image with this statement. I'm a Psychology Graduate, and my husband is an Electrical Engineer.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

Sitting still with no flickering the way the lights seemed to be shining seemed like they were all PMing from focal point inside the clouds I thought maybe the lighter could have came from something from down on the grounds  but the lights seem to be shining out rather then being projected from the ground. I started at it until I couldn't see it anymore.  I'm sure there were many people to see this because it caused number to number traffic for a while I have a video and some pictures;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
