Triangle shaped dark craft hovers and then flys off at phenomenal speed;1985-05-08 21:30:00;<10 minutes;Triangle shaped dark craft hovers and then flys off at phenomenal speed I was walking my small dog one night in Orlando College Park area.  I heard what I thought was a whirring sound of a helicopter and saw lights and assumed it was a helicopter landing at the nearby hospital.  It began to fly directly over me and hovered, when I looked up, I realized (gulp) that it looked nothing like a helicopter and looked like a small version of a  stealth jet, which of course cannot hover.  It had very bright lights emanating from it all around the sides and at least one shining down from the bottom of the craft.  I looked over to my dog and she was looking up at it and was mesmerized, but not barking, which she would normally do at loud big things.   I looked back up at the object, which was about 40 to 50 feet above us, and it suddenly moved sideways for about 200 feet, then went up into space at an incredible speed that within 30 seconds, it was up so high it looked like a star.  I had never seen anything move that fast ever.  My father was an air force pilot, so I am familiar with planes and jets.   For days afterward, my dog just lay around listless, and I felt strange as well, extreme fatigue yet a blissful mental state. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Fast, object with lights;2000-12-15 20:00:00;?;Fast, object with lights At about 8pm edt. Me and two of my cousins witnessed an amazing site... We were videoing when somthing caught our eye. It was a triangular shaped craft, only about 200-300 feet above us. It was was moving strait with some odd twists. It had three bright light's. After about 15 seconds it vanished before our eyes! We did manage to get it on tape! After the event we were real freaked out! ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  PD));28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Craft was flat black, noiseless and massive and boomerang in shape all smoothe in detail outline.;2000-12-19 20:00:00;6 minutes;Craft was flat black, noiseless and massive and boomerang in shape all smoothe in detail outline. The UFO sighted was triangular in shape, flat black with no lights. It was hovering due south, about 100 ft or a little more over homes across the street where I was stopped in my vehicle. There was NO NOISE.  This craft was facing the Orlando International Airport. My mother, her best friend and myself witnessed this craft in its silence hovering so close to the homes roof tops. We were directly across the street from its massive frame. The craft simulated that of a fat boomerang with not pointed edges, and huge in width. We watched this craft for several minutes before having to continue our travel. No writing on the aircraft, my father having been a Mustang Pilot, I was familiar with decals and or writing on wings and body of most aircraft. Undoubtedly, we were all completely startled as this craft and its silence just sat so closely above these homes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Three lighted triangular craft make no sound and erratically circle just north of Orlando for five minutes.;2002-05-12 02:23:00;5 MINUTES;Three lighted triangular craft make no sound and erratically circle just north of Orlando for five minutes. While working as a security guard I observed from atop a downtown parking garage what appeared at first to be three craft approaching from the north like airplanes do going to the main airport.  But then I observed that they were much too closely spaced to be regulated aircraft.  As they got near downtown they began to move in motions of lazy turns, banks and doublebacks like seagulls, at random and not in formation, and not like any planes I've ever seen.  The front of the craft had half a dozen white lights.  There were no other lights and no sound was heard.  I used an 8x eyepiece to get a better view. The rear of the craft was square so the whole thing appeared to be an obtuse triangle with the large angle at the nose.  The craft appeared black.  I double-checked myself that these were not blimps, spotlights, laserlights, helicopters, normal airplanes, birds, nor reflections.  Their size appeared to be about twice as big as a large commercial plane.  After a few minutes they moved slowly off to the northwest and disappeared in the haze.  Their altitude was about that of planes coming into the city just about 5-10 miles from the airport.  Their speed was similar to jets flying normally, or just a tad faster.  The weather was mostly clear with some haze.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Triangular shape in sky with bright lights.;2002-10-31 03:05:00;5 minutes;Triangular shape in sky with bright lights. My wife and I were awoken by a loud siren noise, like a police siren or something. When I went to the window, I heard wind gusts and saw lights. I thought it was a helicopter, so I ran outside to see. When I went outside, I looked up and was surprized to see a large trianglar shape hovering over my house. As soon as I ran outside, the triangle made a loud bleep sound and took off, unnaturally fast. And that was it.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Perfectly shaped black triangles flying low over Orlando tourist area.;2003-02-16 20:00:00;30 seconds;Perfectly shaped black triangles flying low over Orlando tourist area. My wife and I were coming out of a church meeting, when she looked into the sky and said What's that?. There were 3 perfectly shaped triangles flying in formation, in an irregular way (not like normal aircraft). They were flying low, below the upper level clouds. In fact, that was the only way to see them in that they blotted out the stars and the clouds above then. There were no lights at all. There was no sound at all. I have seen stealth aircraft several times (even at night) and they do not look perfectly triangular. These were, equal sides with no Flaps or appendages. They flew quickly accross the sky, zig-zagging and speeding up/slowing down in an unusual way. Then they sped off at a great rate of speed and were gone from sight. This was right over the intersection of I-4 and International Drive, in the toutist district. We thought that it was pretty bold of whosever they were to fly over the city. But, in truth, unless you were looking right at them you would not see them. Later, it appeared to us that some jets flew accross the sky in the same direction, perhaps in pursuit? We have shared this story with many people, but never knew there was a place like this to report it. Thank you.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
2 witnesses viewed 4 triangular objects over Orlando with white flashing lights & a red light underneath in the upper atmosphere.;2003-09-17 22:35:00;15 minutes;2 witnesses viewed 4 triangular objects over Orlando with white flashing lights & a red light underneath in the upper atmosphere. On Wed. September 17th at aproximately 10:30 pm my wife and I began our nightly walk of our dog.  It was a particularly clear night and as we walked I was looking at Mars which was very clear and visible in the night sky.  At about 10:35 pm something caught my attention in the sky to the right of my view of Mars.  It was a flashing white light moving West to east, but it was so high up I thought it was a satelite (which can be seen from time to time on a clear night).  I stopped my wife so I can point the satelite out to her.  She finally focused in and saw the flashing light, however it wasn't the lights I was pointing to... she had discovered a second flashing light.  This one was stationary directly below our Mars view.  The first object was heading directly towards the second object.  The stationary object also had a red light underneath.  When the first object lined up directly over the stationary object the two then began to move.  The first object that had been going West to East now changed direction and moved in unison with the second object heading now in a south to north direction.  At that point I knew that this wasn't a satelite, because satelites don't make a 90 degree turn and change direction.  These objects were very high up in earths upper atmosphere.  We watched as these 2 objects moved northward and then in the distance we saw a third stationary object flashing...  and then a fourth.  The 2 new objects appeared to be stationary and the first 2 objects were heading directly towards them.  At this point we became very uneasy.  We tried to think of rational explanations to explain what we were seeing.  The first 2 objects now lined up with the 2 new objects and all 4 began to head nothwards.  It also became clear that the object my wife had spotted was substantially larger than the other 3 and it appeared by the flashing lights to be triangular with a red light underneathe.  The larger object also appeared to be riding point as it was slightly ahead of the others.  As th! ey began moving north the 3 other objects suddenly went black and only the larger object was visible.We debated that it might be some kind of Military project, however I doubt the military has anything that can hover in the upper atmosphere at a stand still, wait for the other objects to catch up and then proceed, and satelites certainly can't change direction or wait for other satelites to catch up to them and then move.  I consider ourselves to be a very normal American couple and not UFO enthusiasts.   We are rational people and we witnessed something that defies rational. If there was ever a doubt that there is something else out their we have now seen it with our own eyes.  My wife, a devout Christian, didn't want to see this.  It has been an upsetting encounter for her because it cannot be explained.  The entire encounter took approximately 10-15 minutes.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
My daughter and I saw this triangular-shaped silvery object than was like nothing she or I have ever seen.;2004-03-13 15:00:00;10 minutes;My daughter and I saw this triangular-shaped silvery object than was like nothing she or I have ever seen. My daughter and I were in our jacuzzi just looking up at the beautiful blue sky and enjoying the sunshine on this cloudless day.  When I looked to the east, I saw this triangular-shaped silvery object.  At first I thought it was just a high-flying kite, but it was moving.  I then saw a very distinct circular light on the bottom of it.  (Also in the sky overhead were several commercial airliners and what looked like a pair of fighter jets they appeared to be plodding through the sky, compared to the triangle.)  The triangle moved in an arc, but faster than anything I have ever seen before.  Also, it would hover in one spot for many seconds, then move on.  My daughter saw the same thing.  She went to get our telescope.  When I tried to get a better look, it just disappeared.  It also had no contrail.  I don't believe in UFO's, but I think I saw my first one.  Maybe the military is testing new-fangled things... ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Bright Orange, blazing traingular object/light moving upward at an angle Orlando FL 3/8/07, 2215hrs.;2007-03-08 22:15:00;2 min;Bright Orange, blazing traingular object/light moving upward at an angle Orlando FL 3/8/07, 2215hrs. Looking into the night sky ranging from 30 to 80 degree from my point of view from the Suburban Extended stay Hotel exit 75B off of I-4 East in Orlando Florida (across from the entrance of the Universal Studios) looking Westward (I believe) I saw a bright blaze orange intense triangular shaped light.  The light / object looked burning in nature and moved in a arching movement in the upward direction across my line of sight from right to left (but believe it was also moving away from me) and disappeared at about the 80 degree point fading as it went higher.  Why I didn't take a picture I don't know (with my cell phone) my digital camera battery had died earlier that night. I thought it could have been a rocket launch, but I hadn't heard anything on the news about a launch and I checked the NASA site for scheduled launches and nothing was reported.  It could have been a classified military launch but don't know, so that's why I am reporting it.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Triangle shaped object flying over Orlando, Fl.;2007-05-28 22:45:00;15 minutes;Triangle shaped object flying over Orlando, Fl. At about 22:45 while coming home, I observed a triangle shaped craft moving very slowly from the NW to the SE across the sky.  The craft had 3 lights, one on each corner of the triangle and very dim white in color.  The craft made no sound and there was a stillness in the air.  The craft was very large approx. 500 feet across and approx. 500 feet from front to back.  It was about 600 to 800 feed in the sky.  The color was a dark gray color.  That night the sky was clear with stars very visible in the sky as the craft moved across the sky it darkened out the stars in the background.  The Orlando Int. Airport had planes coming in and going out, but this thing was too low in their flight path.  Living in Fl. you get to know those strange planes, the sounds they make, the way they move, etc.  But this thing made no sounds and was moving too slow to be any plane that I am aware of.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
V shaped red lights flying overhead, very large and silent;2007-08-12 23:45:00;1 minute;V shaped red lights flying overhead, very large and silent I went out to watch the Perseid Meteor Shower. I was lying down next to my pool which is screened in but I still could see the stars easy enough.  I am an amateur astronomer and I specialize in imaging so I know the night sky well.  It was 11:45  and I was laying down and watching the stars when I saw it. It was a perfect V shaped set of red lights going right overhead. I believe there were 6 lights on each of the two sides. There was no noise and no strobes. The lights did not change position to each other and the object went across the sky at a moderate speed. This object was quite large, about the size of two full moons. So either it was a very large object at a very high altitude or still a large object at a lower altitude. Either way I did not see any strobes or hear any noise. I have jets fly over my house all the time and it’s quite easy to tell them apart even at night time and this did not look nothing like one. In fact I watch a jet fly over about 10 minutes later and not only could I hear it and see its strobe lights, it was much, much smaller is size. I have seen blimps to and it did not look like them. I was wondering if anyone else noticed this object that night at that time frame. I would find it hard to believe that no one else saw it.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

Black Triangle, Three lights in the shape of a triangle.;2009-04-10 11:34:00;0:10 seconds;Black Triangle, Three lights in the shape of a triangle. Last saturday at about 8pm, I saw a black triangle go over my house, I could barely see it, but then it went between me and clouds, I could see it clearly for just a second or two.  It was a black triangle, it was approximately 4-7000ft, it made no sound and was moving faster than any commercial aircraft I had ever seen.  The whole sighting lasted about 7-10 seconds.  I shrugged it off thinking that it was a commercial aircraft because I live close to MCO airport and it caught me by suprise and I didnt get time to focus and think. Tonight at approximately 11:35, I was in the back yard, and I looked up and saw three lights in the shape of a triangle. Tonight, it looked as if it was three lights in the shape of a triangle, but I couldnt make out the shape like I could before.  There was a very very slight overcast, but it was definately there, I followed it from almost righ above me to about 22.5 degrees and it disappeared into thin air.  The sky was hazy, but I could still see the stars through it.  The lights made no sound, they moved very quickly, and just disappeared.  I thoufht that I was crazy the first time I saw it, or maybe because I saw it by suprise and didnt get enough time to actually focus on it and thought it was a plane.  Tonight I was able to fully watch it, and I know it wasn't a commercial aircraft. It disappeared right in front of my eyes.  It almost looked like three symetrical spotlights pointed at the sky then moved across and turned off.  I have never seen anything like this before.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Amber orbish lights passing in formation;2011-04-08 22:00:00;4-5 minutes;Amber orbish lights passing in formation Around 10 PM on April 8th, I received a call from a friend driving through my neighborhood.  He asked me to go outside because he has seen lights in the sky.   When a friend and I went outside, we immediately saw 3 amber shaped orbish lights traveling in triangle that appeared geometrically accurate.  A separate, similar sized light was leading the triangle at an unknown distance.  Shortly after the triangle passed overhead, a 5 and 6thth amber light came into view following the triangle.  In total, there were 6 lights.  The height and distance between the individual orbs was difficult to estimate because I have never seen anything that moved like them.  They moved in sync and had none of the characteristics of traditional, well known aircraft.  I have always been a UFO skeptic but this changed my perception.  I wish I had a better video but my iPhone did a decent job of at least catching the lights.   After passing overhead, the lights just faded out.  They never incr! eased in speed or brightness.  Various people in the area reported similar sightings but the local airport said they had not seen anything. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I stated to my passanger the plane was flying low.  Then quickly reassessed and stated it didn't appear to be a plane but a tower.   As we drove towards the object it aligned with the interstate and hovered slowly moved over us.  It was a large triangle moving with the flat side forward.  The object was black with a bright white light at each point, a small blinking red light on the center under belly along with approx 6 small white lights on the under belly.  I could not tell the height but the width was very large.   I was able to watch it through the rearview for a while and decided to turn around.  It was gone when I reentered the interstate in the west bound direction.  Windows were up so I did not note noise. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous provides no contact information.

F-22 like star shaped (7 point star) object flying extremelly fast, no sound/no light;2012-03-25 17:30:00;3 seconds;F-22 like star shaped (7 point star) object flying extremelly fast, no sound/no light I was laying in the pool deck of my housing complex (in Baldwin Park) with my chase chair against the sun observing the beautiful blue blue sky that day and watching the aircrafts crossing by.  Therefore, I was watching the sky up, but facing North-Northeast (Ursa Major) direction to be more precise.    That's when I noticed a single flying object crossing the sky in the same direction (Ursa Major) and disappearing behind the club house.  Time was between 5:30-5:45pm EST.   Sighting took about 3 seconds, it almost looked like a shooting star (but a bit slower) and the most intriguing part was its shape and rate of speed. It looked like an F-22, but more star shaped (7 points), grayish/light blue almost blending with the sky color, traveling between 20,000-30,000ft altitude, extremely fast I would estimate over 3,000mph given its height and the sighting duration but no sound, no trail, nor lights.  Measured 2/16 inches (squared). And given my background in the space program I can certainly say I have never seeing something like that before.  I have seeing in naked eyes satellites, space station, space shuttles, shooting stars but this sighting does not compare to anything technological that I know of.  And fighter planes usually scream in the air, and commercial planes you can still hear them. ;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
I saw 3 very red lights hovering in a triangle shape near Sea World Orlando Florida and they dissappeared about 5 minutes later.;2012-08-11 21:00:00;Unknown, possibly about 5;I saw 3 very red lights hovering in a triangle shape near Sea World Orlando Florida and they dissappeared about 5 minutes later. We were riding a roller coaster called Kraken in Sea World Orlando Florida, and we were being pulled up by a chain pull and we were just about to the top of the hill and I looked to the right towards Disney World and I saw 3 red lights in a triangle formation. They were very bright.   The next thing I now we are going down the drop of the ride and I didnt see anything else.  I told everyone and everyone thought was crazy.  I wanted my father to see it so we went on again and I looked in the direction again and it was gone and there was a big thing of smoke that looked like a space shuttle took off in place of it. It couln't be fireworks because the lights were moving to the right they werent going up. They also lasted like 7 seconds and fireworks last for about 3 seconds. They were not flashing and were very close. Airplanes can't do that. Also airplanes don't dissapear or travel the whole horizon in 5 minutes. My dad said the millitary would be watching and the! y would send out helicopters and I think I saw 2 helicopters or maybe I saw the same helicopter twice. There is this video of the same thing happening in the same location 10 days prior. Here it is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeaq0LIvCmA This was also on the news about this happening in another state a few months ago.

There were a total of six lights yellow with a touch of orange in color, three lights on the left and three lights on the right, the positioning of these lights (If one were to connect the dots) the connection would make a triangle, one triangle of lights on the left and the other triangle of lights on the right.

I have been driving on I4 exiting Davenport and saw a Very big mothership like craft floating to the left sky of the highway that had flashing lights and had a very odd shape almost like a triangle, it has a grey color and very visible in the sky.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Green triangle rapidly and silently moving East;2020-12-31 01:37:00;approximately one second;Green triangle rapidly and silently moving East On 12/31/2020 at approximately 06:37 UTC (01:37 local/EST) I was in vicinity of the approach lights of Runway 35R  at KMCO (this is shortly North-West of Lake Nona) when as I looked to the West I saw movement directly above me.  What I observed was a triangular shaped aircraft flying on an approximate heading of 090, at a very high speed. The trailing edges of the object were illuminated in a neon green and they appeared to flicker similar to the way an NE-2 neon lamp or high pressure sodium street lamp flickers when you move your eyes as you look at it.  It looked very similar to the triangular shaped highlighters many of us had in school, where each corner of the triangle was a different color marker tip.  The object appeared to be flying above or in a 5500' cloud deck (per the ATIS) and it covered perhaps 1/2-1/3 of my observable sky in under a second.  I would estimate the object's speed to be approximately 300-500kt., it was well above the speed one might observe a typical commercial or GA aircraft upon departure. There was no sound or overpressure associated with this object and since I am unsure the height I am unable to determine the size of the object.  It appeared about as big as a man's hand when viewed at arm's length, but again I am unsure of the size of the object.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
