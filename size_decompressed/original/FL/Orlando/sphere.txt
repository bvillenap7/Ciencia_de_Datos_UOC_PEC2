We were driving south on Semoran Blvd. near the airport in Orlando when we turned east toward a restaurant. In the eastern sky, at approx. 40 degrees above the horizon, there were two spherical objects emitting a bright white light.  The objects were clearly defined with a haze surrounding them.  The closest analogy I can think of is the appearance of a flashlight in fog.  The sky was generally clear and the airplanes preparing for landing were clearly distinguishable. The airplane lights did not exhibit this same haze so I don't think the haze surrounding the spheres was the result of any cloud cover.  The two objects were hovering near each other but at slightly different elevations.  The sphere to the left was slightly elevated over the right sphere.  We slowed down to watch the objects, initially assuming that it was some unannounced launch from KSC.  However, the objects didn't move. They appeared to hover in the same position.  This period was long enough for us to observe them and conjecture as to what we were seeing.  The two objects disappeared suddenly.  When we got to the restaurant parking lot, several other people were standing around discussing what we had just seen. Orlando news covered the reports and showed video taken in Ft. Myers.  This video is an accurate representation of what we saw in Orlando.  Local news also reported that Patrick Air Force Base released a statement that the objects were the result of naval operations.  They gave no further expanation. ((NUFORC:  Probable missile launch.));28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

Then when I looked closely enough at about 300 yards away I was a silver sphere. The sphere went straight up out of a cloud went around in circles and then disappeared. I was walking away and looked back up and it started going in circles, went behind a cloud, and came back up only to disappear again!!! There was no noise so it could not have been a plane or a helicopter and was definetly not a blimp!!!  Please tell me what it was ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is anonymous, and provides no e-address.

Unknown object tracks two witnesses at close range in Green Swamp.;2001-07-13 00:00:00;10 mins;Unknown object tracks two witnesses at close range in Green Swamp. sunset@sunet.net! July 13, 2001, 9:30 p.m.,  Green Swamp, west of Orlando Reported to Tampa Bay MUFON Hot line While driving home on State Road 474 west of Orlando, Witness #1 and his son (13 year old) saw a pin ball like object, 30-40 inch diameter seen in rear window of his automobile.  It was reflecting back the details of the rear lights of the car.  It was shimmering as they drove and they both had the feeling that they were being watched.  He drove faster thinking that Something was coming on us.   As he looked at the rear view mirror the reflection was as a convex chromium surfaced object (pin ball) and he said he had difficulty focusing on it.  He thought the object to be 3-4 feet behind his car.   He said that there was something blocking the night sky as he looked up.   When they reached the end of the road they noted that there was an increase of light without any visible  shadows.  Both witnesses were frightened.  When they examined the car upon arriving at home (10 or 15 minute drive), there was nothing on the car or back window, no oily residue.

It was also noted that the object had no external lights, but appeared to be illuminated from within, not flickering, but a solid steady light. The size of the object was thought to be about the size of an automobile. My wife also stated that the object was flying so slow as to almost appear to be hovering but was clearly moving from west to east across the sky, the object had no sound whatever, but both witnesses believe that the object seemed to be powered as even a balloon floating with the slight breeze that night, would have drifted quicker than this object. Both witnesses were very insistent as there are many blimps in this area, that this was not an airship, as by law they have navigational and blinking becons and are loud. Both insisted this was something strange and feel that it was definately not a balloon of any sorts or other conventional aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

BUBBLE IN THE SKY;2004-05-01 14:00:00;5 min;BUBBLE IN THE SKY Craft was non-physical by metalic means. Appeared sphere-like shaped and composed of gas. Craft wobbled in diagnal form, slow pace towards my direction as I sat waiting for the bus in Orlando Florida's Unversity Blvd/Semoran Blvd intersection. As craft/object moved across the sky (about 6-9 building stories high), I could see a source of heat towards the back but no metals could be spotted. Object retained characteristics (skin) of the sky so it actually appeared like a bubble through the sky reflecting the sky.

Sphere of light descends, emitts blinding bright light across city, then shoots up back into atmosphere at light speed;2004-11-19 17:30:00;2 minutes;Sphere of light descends, emitts blinding bright light across city, then shoots up back into atmosphere at light speed AT 5:30 AM on 11/19/2004, I noticed an object in the sky the size of a pea. (If I were to hold up a pea as high as I could and look directly at it.) It was a clear night but was still dark out. With no clouds to use as a reference, it was difficult to tell how far up in the sky this object was relative to where I was standing. I assumed at first it was a low flying aircraft on it's approach to the airport coming from the EAST. I thought this was an aircraft possibly in trouble due to the speed and angle of descent compared to most other aircraft that are approaching Orlando's airport. This object came to a sudden halt without making noise and hovered for about 3 seconds before separating into 3 pieces. It was more like the original object kept its size and shape,, but 2 objects broke off the sides of the sphere at the same time. The movement of both side objects was very symmetrical. These 2 objects left a weird trial of what seemed like smoke but was hard to tell. The larger original object never seemed to emit any trail or make any noise. What reminded me of booster rockets off of a shuttle or a multi staged rocket left me to believe at first that this was some sort of secret launch that went awry or a secret shuttle mission that launched however, I knew that all shuttle launches during take off execute a pitch and roll immediately out into the Atlantic so as to be far from land in the event of an emergency. Keep in mind,, I still don't know how far the object was in the sky relative to where I was. Even know I can see the shuttle burn from a day or night time launch from Orlando, the distance would be too far from the cape to see individual rocket boosters fall off. These 2 objects that broke off did not emit any light but the light from the Original object was enough to see these two objects separate from the original at the same time and leave a trail of what looked like white smoke. So far still no noise. Then, 3 seconds after the 2 mini objects broke off,,, a light so bright started to shine everywhere. It wasn't blinding like the sun,, however, it shined brighter. It lit up the whole sky and the neighborhood, brighter than the 12'oclock sun. I stood still and was able to continue looking at the source of the light. The object was still in the same spot in the sky. I thought this was a nuclear blast of the air burst type however, the light kept shining for about 35 to 40 seconds. This light wasn't vibrating or sporadic,,, like you would see in fireworks,, or a flare or a meteorite in the sky. It maintained a constant candlepower without the strobing effect. I remember looking all around to see if this light was concentrated in a specific area. The whole sky and everywhere I looked,, this light was shinning. If it wasn't for me knowing where the object was in the sky,, it would of been hard to tell where the light source was coming from directionally since it appeared to be coming from everywhere. After what seemed like 40 seconds,, this light shrinked back to its source in the sky. The strange thing was that the brightness of the light remained the same while the area it was covering started to shrink back to the object. It took about 5 seconds from when it started shrinking, until all you saw was the object still hovering in the same spot in the sky. Then within a second, this object shot right back up into the atmosphere at what appeared like light speed. It left in the opposite direction, not directly up, more like up and eastward at an angle. The trail it left didn't appear to be smoke. It was more like the trail you would see if you waved a kem-lite in front of your face in the dark from left to right as fast as you can. It took off so fast without noise that it left a light trail for about 2 seconds. According to local radio stations and the local CBS TV affiliate, (www.local6news.com) hundreds of people in Orlando that were traveling to work or on the road reported the blinding light. Most witnesses said it lasted between 30 to 50 seconds. Some drivers were running through traffic lights because they couldn't tell if the lights were green or red. A meteor scientist from Brevard county on the east coast said he witnessed the object that morning and gave coordinates that put the object directly above OIA.

After about 10 seconds of traveling north, a shooting star streaked in the northbound objects path.  When we looked back at the east bound object, we could not see it.  The northbound object went behind some trees at which time we were no longer able to see it.

Possible Blimp or UFO;2006-02-06 18:30:00;2 Minutes;Possible Blimp or UFO In the north eastern sky, right after dark, I saw a white grouping of lights above a tree line behind my home near our lake. There is a sports arena close by and I thought it was a blimp because I have seen them flying during the day in that area. The bottom of the craft seemed to be lined with lights that formed almost a full circle, about 3/4 of a circle. The craft dipped below the trees and began to head north at a lower altitude. I wanted to show a friend and my husband who came out and we watched it continue north through the tree branches and skyline until it seemed to head east again and disappear from site. I also heard a helicopter but could not see one. There is a flight pattern in the direction it moved towards and I saw many planes and heard helicopters for about 20 minutes after the sighting. I tried to find a blimp schedule with no luck. I did look up some pictures of blimps at night and this did not look anything like what pictures I found on the net. The lights twinkled and seemed clustered together at times and the shape seemed more mushroom shaped at times. It was a huge light in the sky, easily 100 times the size of Venus.

Blue metallic sphere in early morning sky;2009-08-03 05:50:00;approximately 20 minutes;Blue metallic sphere in early morning sky At 5:50AM, I was walking my dog, as always, along my street, strolling casually and checking out the dawn sky.  As I looked towards the WSW, I saw an object...blue with a metallic quality, spherical, at approximately 60 degrees above the horizon.  No lights...no glow...but clearly there. It was about the size of a fairly large star.  As we walked along, I kept an eye on it, and it remained stationary...same height and same location in the sky. This lasted for almost 20 minutes.  As we were heading back to the house from the end of our walk, I noticed that the object began to glow with very clear blue color, a couple of shades darker than robin's egg blue, the metallic quality no longer visible.  As it got brighter, it also began to slowly pulsate.  The pulsation grew faster, and the glow grew brighter. Suddenly, as it was about as bright as it seemed it could get, and pulsing as fast as a strobe, it took off in a N direction...in motion and out of sight in about 2! seconds. I called in this report to NUFORC as soon as I got in the house. I would certainly like to know if anyone else saw this incredible object that morning, or at any time before or since.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Very bright sphere flying at a high velocity through the sky.;2009-10-04 21:00:00;2 mins;Very bright sphere flying at a high velocity through the sky. I was sitting outside of my house smoking a cigarette and I was looking at the sky thinking to myself that it is a very nice night out tonight... It was very cloudy and the moon was shining bright.. The cloud formation I believe was cirrus and I can see the clouds clearly.. As I am looking through the sky I see this very very bright object flying across the sky at a high velocity!! faster than a air plane, helicopter, or blimp!! It looked like a very bright sphere shaped object off of ufo videos that I normally see! And it was flying very fast and as it was flying over me I saw a very very small light behind it.. So maybe it could of been a military aircraft??? but i dont think there are any military bases around my area where I live.. And I can also hear it too! But as soon as I saw my neighbor across the street I screamed his name and I said look at that ufo!! and he said oo no thats the lights from universal studios!! and I said  you don't see that! bright light flying across the sky? and he kept looking at the universal studios lights.. Then I found that to be very odd... because that light was extremely bright and low to the ground... I know that sounds crazy and you might think that I have been smoking some shit, but no I dont smoke weed... But it was crazy.. Then it flew away and disappered in the clouds..

No sound.   I ran inside to get my daughter. When we came back out, the ball had stopped moving and was now suspended in the air, alarmingly close above the neighbor's roof. (Perhaps 200 feet?)  We stood fixated, watching the object, guessing what it may be.  As we were talking, we observed three tiny orange lights blink in consecutively, below the ball.  The small lights were below the object pearled together at an angular slope of about 45 degrees.  Once they blinked in, they began rapidly pulsating, one after the other, consecutively.  Then, the big ball began shrinking slowly, and while it shrank, the little lights blinked out a few seconds later, again, consecutively.  Then, the big ball faded out of sight, as well, right on the spot where it had been.  Because the object was not moving, and hovering low, at t! he time it faded out, we thought it had cloaked itself.  After that I made a report to MUFON.   I am now reporting it here, as well.

Red/Raspberry Pulsating Orb Travelling in Straight Line from E to W;2013-08-17 20:55:00;3 minutes;Red/Raspberry Pulsating Orb Travelling in Straight Line from E to W Event time: appoximately 8:55pm EST on 8/17/2013  Location: I was sitting on my outside screened-in patio cooking burgers on our grill   Observation:  I noticed the peculiar colored and flashing object as it was passing over me. First thoughts: I looked for the tell-tale signs of airplane lights, but there were no wing lights, gear lights or any typical airplane lights whatsoever.  Being a trained pilot, I knew this was not a blimp or airplane.  I knew within seconds that this was something different, and ran outside my patio to take some pictures. Description:  The UFO was a spherical/elliptal shape of flashing pulsating reddish/raspberry light.  There was no pattern to the flashing, and seemed random.  It was moving slowly from East to West, perhaps SE to NW, or thereabouts.   An airliner passed above it, coming from MCO... typically airliners at this point are probably 8000-10000 feet up, and seemed to cross its path, so it was lower than that, and would estimate it was around 3000-5000'. Feelings:  Excitement.  I have only seen 1 other UFO several years ago, and was excited to see another one.  I immediately ran outside my screen to take some zoomed in pictures on my cellphone before it disappeared…  I was able to get 3 in, as it traveled to the W/NW.  I tried to get my family out after taking these pictures, but in the time it took for them to get out, the object had already disappeared completely into the distance. Lost sight:  I lost sight of the object as i was trying to get my family to join me in seeing this object.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

Sphere over Orlando, FL  07.11.15.;2015-07-11 18:30:00;~15 seconds;Sphere over Orlando, FL  07.11.15. Spherical craft seemed to rise up from the approximate coordinate 28.569478, -81.307457  and pass due south over 28.539585, -81.305258.  It traveled at a high rate of speed (from just above horizon to past and beyond the buildings to south in 15 or so seconds).  It could have been traveling up and then went south or might have been further away and seem to be rising first.  I estimate that is 3.5 miles in 15 seconds or 840mph.   It also preceded a southward moving storm and traveling in the center of the airport landing flight paths. The object had no details or irregularities--just a plain sphere.  I thought it might be the bulb of a helicopter at first, but it flew directly above me in clear sky and had no tail or rotor.  It started white (almost bright as it seemed to be ascending) and turned grey as it passed overhead, like moving to the shadow side of a sphere but the sun was west and low at 6:30pm.

Large, bright, high altitude white sphere moving very slowly from north to southeast then drops;2016-10-20 19:40:00;2-3 minutes;large, bright, high altitude white sphere moving very slowly from north to south-east---- then drops about 7:30-7:40 pm- just dark  about 15 min. had just unloaded some brush from the back of my truck and finished just as it became too dark to see what I was doing.  Drove the truck back up to the other end of property.  After I got out I noticed a bright light.  Didn't think anything of it at first as I am only about 3 miles north of the international airport.  I stood and watched a moment.  I immediately noticed that it was barely moving---  way slower than a jetliner would be going......  it also appeared very bright and large as well.   I had binoculars just inside the door of my shop.  I grabbed them and watched the object.  (7x50)    It showed to be perfectly spherical and a bright white light evenly distributed over the surface.  The light was a pure white-- not the red-orange that is reflected off satellites just after dark.  It seemed to be moving very slowly across the sky.  Jupiter (or Saturn) was just setting in the western sky--- and the object was was about 1 to 2 times the diameter of the planet.   The objects speed seemed to vary from very slow to all most stopped. Judging by the very slow speed --- a satellite at that slow speed would have to be several thousand miles out to go that slowly----  and to have THAT angular diameter at that distance---  it would have had to be many miles across. However I don't believe it was a satellite- as it was the wrong color and the brightness did not decrease as it went off zenith towards the far horizon as a satellite would have.  I watched it from just north of zenith at about a  020 compass heading------ and  ended at about 150 degrees near the tops of the far pine trees. I estimate I watched it through about 60 degree arc ------ and  for about 2 to 2.5 minutes through that arc.   I watched it move very slowly along the above path.  as it approached the top of the trees to the south-east----  it slowed to nearly a stop---- and then it changed direction to going straight down and behind the trees.  I did not see much decrease in brightness except that would be consistent with the object getting farther away gradually.  It did not wink-out like satellites do ( which they do long before they get near the tree line)  I am a physicist by degree and have piloted airpcraft.  The object had NO navigation lights of any kind and no tail beacon.  The light did not have the look of a bulb ( a tiny point) either a nav light or a landing light. I compared its color to several passing airliners which were about 10-20 miles away. The aircraft's white lights were more orange than the object.   It was a bright white sphere with the illumination evenly distributed across the whole surface. there seemed no way to estimate how high it could have been.   I don't believe it was any normal aircraft or man made satellite. My location was about 4 miles e-ne of the Orlando international airport.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

We witnessed wave after wave of orange flame like balls of light coming from the west and heading east northeast.  They first started going over in pairs and then the rest were staggered.   Objects appeared to be moving at around 800 to 1000 mph at about three thousand feet altitude.  On some of the objects the flame would go dim but you could still see a blue glow around the object and track it across the sky.  The objects made no noise and were probably five miles to the north of us as they crossed the sky.   I am a ten year naval aviation veteran and my uncle is a retired airforce veteran.  Neither one of us has ever seen anything like that before.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

They whipped back and forward across the sky in a straight line.  Then they stopped and formed a circle and began to rotate around each other and form diffrent shapes.   This went on for 1 minute and a half, then they disappeared.   I got back in my car drove a half mile further and the same thing occured again.  This time for 45 seconds to a minute.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

No flashing lights to indicate that it was an airplane.  I watched it thinking it might be a satellite, but it moved too quickly.  I tried to videotape it, but could not center it. I have a photo.  The orb continued south at a high rate, then slowed down and the lights went out.  There was no sound.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
