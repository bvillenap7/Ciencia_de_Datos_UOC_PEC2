Huge grouping of lights defining a boomerang shape silently moved above me on my early morning dog walk.;2004-03-29 05:15:00;30 seconds;Huge grouping of lights defining a boomerang shape silently moved above me on my early morning dog walk. I was taking  the dog for his walk as I usually do every morning about the same so I remember looking at the clock before I left my apartment and it was 5:12am. We stopped at his favorite spot which was very near the maintanance office with a small grassy area. While he was doing his business I was looking up at the dark sky as I usually do while waiting for him to move on. Just above the building I caught site of something faint moving behind the antena which was positioned on the roof.My first thought was that it was a flock of birds in formation so I moved to my right to get a better unobstructed view. That is when I clearly saw the slowly and silently moving boomerang shaped object which was traveling to the south.The underside of the object was coverd with yellowish white lights which defined it's shape and I could also see the stars black out as it passed under them. What was really amzing to me was the size of this thing. I can only only reference it by saying it was like standing under a floating city of lights.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
August 7, 2012 sighting of orange lights in the sky in western Orange County, FL (near Walt Disney World);2012-08-07 21:43:00;3 minutes;August 7, 2012 sighting of orange lights in the sky in western Orange County, FL (near Walt Disney World) I just filed this report, but put on the wrong date (I accidentally put on tomorrow's date of 08/08/12  -- instead of today's date of 08/07/12). On August 7, 2012, around 9:43 pm EDT, when traveling home from Winter Garden Village shopping/restaurant area on FL CR 535, my husband, adult daughter, and I saw orange, round lights in the sky as we were heading to our home near the Magic Kingdom area of Walt Disney World.   The lights were farther west of Disney property.  They changed distances apart, but their formation mostly reminded me of a Nike swoosh symbol.  We continued in the car (my husband would not stop for me to film what we were seeing).  The lights remained the same - no flashing nor changing of color.  After about 3 minutes, they were gone.  I had looked away for only a moment.   I did not see how they left the area or in what direction. All three of the observers have college degrees:  my husband and I have Master's degrees in education and our adult daughter has a Bachelor's degree and is currently working on pre-med classes.  All three of us have some interest in Astronomy.  These were not stars or constellations.  I am also a huge fan of shows such as UFO Hunters and Ancient Aliens.  I never, ever thought I would witness something like this.  I was extremely curious and excited when I saw the lights, but not necessarily frightened.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

boomerang/light colored/no lights.;2015-10-04 21:50:00;20 seconds;boomerang/ light colored / no lights A boomerang shaped UFO was witnessed at a high altitude, on a clear night.  The object appeared to have a flight path more of a glider than anything else.   It had no lights, but seemed to a a lighter color.  It was very large, maybe 4 times the size of a commercial jet, but as there was not anything to reference the size this is pure speculation.  The object then disappeared behind clouds.

A high flying, large v or u shaped object with no lights, moving relatively fast.;2015-10-04 22:50:00;15 seconds;A high flying, large v or u shaped object with no lights, moving relatively fast. This object was sighted around 9:50 PM eastern time.  It was large v or u shaped object.  In the night sky, it was larger than any plan or even a full moon.  It was moving relatively fast, but slow enough to track it.  It had no visible lights and seemed to have a greyish tint to it.   It was visible for about 15 seconds as it glided through the sky, until I lost sight of it as it flew behind cloud coverage.  I have never seen anything like this before.   Also, there had been a helicopter circling around the sighting for about an hour before the sighting and is still hovering around that same location now, about an hour after the sighting.  It is flying way too high to be a police chopper searching for a suspect on the ground. For the record, I never believed in UFOs and typically have categorized those who do as crazy/stupid.  This is my first UFO sighting, and it was quite bizarre. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
One object in a v-shape of lights.  It looked like 6 lights on each side.  They were not extremely bright.;2017-10-15 22:40:00;15 seconds;One object in a v-shape of lights.  It looked like 6 lights on each side.  They were not extremely bright from my view but very noticeable.  It flew slowly and there was no sound. It looked like it was flying low but at a further distance.  I'm around the airport area and see plenty of planes day and night and never anything like this.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
