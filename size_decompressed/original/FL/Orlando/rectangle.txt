Saw a multi-colored, rectangular object flying through the sky from the NE to the SW...;1980-09-04 17:30:00;10-15 sec.;Saw a multi-colored, rectangular object flying through the sky from the NE to the SW... September 4, 1980, approx. 17:30: The sun was still up, but setting in the west. While talking to a neighbor in the front yard, I had a strange urge to look at the sky. From the NE, a odd, multi-colored, box-rectangular object was silently zipping through the sky to the SW. If on the ground,its dimensions seemed to be about 30' by 30'. It appeared to be constructed like a box-kite, with glowing, colored spars, as if they were fluorescent tubes seen on a carnival ride. Green, red, amber, violet, were the colors. The object rotated end-over-end as it flew. It was at a height around 5,000 ft., and was moving at very high speed. I would guess the speed was around Mach 2 or 3, since it travelled from horizon to horizon at that altitude in less than 15 seconds, and disappeared behind a stand of Southern Oaks, from my perspective. There was a peculiarity about the event that I won't forget: I sensed intuitively that the craft was under highly intelligent control, and was a probe sent for reconnaisance purposes by someone or something not of this Earth.

Military or other?;2000-06-30 13:00:00;10 seconds;Military or other? While serving as an Army officer, I stepped out to my car.  As I was opening the door, a hugh aircraft came overhead.  Probably at least a football field in length.  It passed overhead and out of sight within a second or two and made no sound.  I thought it was just me, but my neighbor across the street had walked outside at the same time I did. We looked at each other and I asked did you see that and the said very loudly a resounding yes.   What was also odd was that it made no sound, gave no vapor or other trail.  I've served as a paratrooper jumping out of prop and jet aircraft, been involved in military aviation activities, served as an Army Aviation Brigade Headquarters Company Commander, and also been a student pilot flying in various prop aircraft.  While stationed and living in Orlando, my family and I watched 13 or 14 NASA rocket lift offs from Patrick AFB (1) and from our yard (remaining 12 or so).  Nothing, nothing comes close to the speed and size of this craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  We have assigned an artificial date in 2000.

Rectangular object  in the sky above Orlando, Florida.;2006-12-26 11:30:00;15 seconds;Rectangular object  in the sky above Orlando, Florida. It was about the width of my thumb held at arm's length. It was one unit high and 6-7 wide. It was dark grey in color against a light grey of thick overcast, though the clouds had visible forms.  It was well defined with sharp corners, so I actually thought it might be a billboard hung from something, but there was nothing above it. There were no letters or other forms on it. No one else seemed to be noticing, but we were driving.  My wife and I are professional educators 67 and 68 years old. It was in the sky north of Orlando at about 30-40 degrees above the horizon.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Brilliant white square stationary in the sky above west Orange County / Lake County Florida.;2008-08-15 18:25:00;5+ minutes;Brilliant white square stationary in the sky above west Orange County / Lake County Florida. On 15 August 2008, from approximately 6:25pm to 6:30pm, I observed an unusual object in the sky while I was driving home from work.  I had just merged onto SR429 from the Florida Turnpike, heading north toward Apopka, Florida.  The weather was partly cloudy, but it was not raining, and visibility was good.  Looking out my driver’s side window (toward the west), something in the sky caught my attention. An incredibly bright, white object appeared to be hovering stationary in the sky at what I would estimate to be 700ft to 800ft in altitude.  My initial reaction was that the object was probably an airplane reflecting sunlight while banking, but after continuing to observe it, I quickly realized that was not the case. The object appeared to be perfectly square in shape, not a cube, but a flat, square shape.  It was smooth, with very clearly defined perimeter lines and corners, and was a very brilliant color of white  incredibly bright, but in a different manner than the brightness of the sun (very comfortable to look at, no glare associated with it, and its brightness did not obscure its shape at all there was no  halo or other glow surrounding it in spite of its brightness).  It seemed to be illuminated from inside of the object, even though the object was so flat that it appeared to be almost two dimensional.  The object was located well below the cloud cover, and stuck out like a sore thumb against the overcast, grey sky. I would estimate my distance from the object to be at least one mile.  I’m not sure I can accurately estimate the size of the object, but my impression was that it was fairly large given that I could clearly see the outline of its shape at that distance.  The best description I can give regarding its size is that if you held your thumb up at arm’s length, the object would appear to be slightly smaller than your thumbnail. The object was absolutely stationary in the sky no movement whatsoever for the entire period that I observed it (at least 5 minutes).  While observing the object, I noticed a small, round flashing light that appeared to be further west of the object, but moving toward it.  When the flashing light had almost reached the bright, square object, they both disappeared.  I spent several minutes trying to spot them again, but they never reappeared.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

Walking my dogs,  looked up the stars and there it was a huge rectangle gliding thru the sky covering the stars.;2017-09-18 04:30:00;45 seconds;Walking my dogs, looked up the stars and there it was a huge rectangle gliding thru the sky covering the stars. No hurry what so ever. No lights no sound. Just gliding, taking its time. I could not believe it. It was closer than I would have expected for such huuuge item. From where I was located it was like looking half the empire state building moving like from Bryant Park. Huge. Distance from me:  As when the airplanes take off MCO and start directing their flights to destination. No too high. (This event took place in Down Town Orlando - East side very, very close to MCO which makes it even more amazing) we call it Sodo. It was grey - silver not shiny but not opaque neither. Not gun metal silver, but not shiny silver. It was like a dark shiny grey from with in. It went perpendicular to earth. Sorry no pictures.  Walking three dogs.  Soooo very sad.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
White, boxy object spotted zooming through the sky, disappeared within seconds.  ((anonymous report));2019-04-15 16:00:00;10 seconds;White, boxy object spotted zooming through the sky, disappeared within seconds. My friend and I were sitting outside, when suddenly a shadow blocked the sun for a second, which alerted us to look to the sky.  When we looked up, we saw a white, boxy object zooming through the sky.  It was extremely high, moving extremely fast (we physically had to turn our heads to keep up with it), and flying out of sight within a few seconds.  There was no noise accompanying it whatsoever.  There were also no trails behind the object. I am someone who is skeptical of sightings but this has convinced me.  There could be no other explanation.  Far too high up to be a bird or plane, and it was flying faster than any plane i’ve ever seen.   My friend is more of a skeptic than I am, but she also agrees what we saw has no other logical explanation.
