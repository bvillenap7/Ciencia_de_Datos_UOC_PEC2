It was too high to be a helicopter and too low to be a star.  (I am also a pilot so I am 100% sure it was not a plane or helicopter.  The object was pulsating a greenish hue with a red flashing light similar to a strobe on the bottom of the cone.  I obtained video and still pictures (not developed yet) of this object. It hovered and pulsated for at least one hour, and then disapearred in less than one second in an upward motion.  It was very clearly a cone shape, as I also viewed it with high-powered binoculars.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
