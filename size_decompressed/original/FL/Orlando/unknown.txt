Three or four red lights int he shape of a squre or triangle way up in the sky moving at a rapid pace.;1998-12-15 23:30:00;1 minute;Three or four red lights int he shape of a squre or triangle way up in the sky moving at a rapid pace. I was looking up in the sky from the balcony of the Disney Beach Club Resort when I saw what appeared to be three or four red lights in a square or triangle shape moving rapidly across the sky.  The distance between the lights appeared to be about 1/4 inch to me. It was way up in the sky - that I know. I do not know the shape of the object but only the shape the lights formed - either a square or triangle. Sorry but I simply can't remember if it was three or four red lights. I think it was four red lights in a square shape. Also I am not sure of the date.  I know it was either 12/15 or 12/16 between the hours of 11pm and 12pm.  If I had to pick a date I would say 12/15. What I did not forget however is how fast it appeared to be moving across the sky.  I would say about 20 times faster than a plane at that distance. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF OTHERS WITNESSED THIS SIGHTING. YOU CAN CONTANCT ME VIA EMAIL.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Three lighted objects flying in formation.;2002-12-30 23:00:00;20 minutes;Three lighted objects flying in formation. I was sitting in the hot tub around 11:00 at night with my boyfriend in the resort that my grandparent's live in a little south of Orlando, Fl. I was looking up into the sky when I noticed a very small circular speck up above the clouds.  It seemed to be above the path of normal airplane traffic.  It emitted a bright white light, different from a star though.  there were maybe two or three of them.  They seemed to be moving in logical order and much quicker than the clouds below and the stars.  one would move away from the other two then they would move away also then they would all reconvene in the same location.  When I say the same location I mean that the exact same spot  that they left from.  this continued for around 15-30 minutes.  When we got on the golf cart to go home we were able to amintain visual contact with them until they faded from our sight.  they were very small shaped circles almost more like little dots than spheres.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

Possible Triangle shaped craft  w/3 flashing white lights seen North of Orlando.;2006-01-08 21:00:00;20 minutes;Possible Triangle shaped craft  w/3 flashing white lights seen North of Orlando. Object observed to the North of my residence, approx. 5 mile(s) distant, comprised of 3 lights (white), pulsating in unison & from angle/distance observed MAY have been in a 'triangle' shape. Object remained totally motionless for at least 5 minutes. I then called my house-mate outside and she observed the same & agreed it did not resemble any airplane/craft as we DO normally see in our area, being in-line north of OIA (Orlando International Airport) & also east-northeast of Orlando Executive Airport. There were NO 'navigation' - 'marker' type lights observed. We together observed the object for a total of approx. 15 minutes when it slowly started drifting northward at an extremely slow pace. This northward drift took on a slight eastward flare and continued until unobservable due to distance after a total observation time of approx. 25 minutes. Sky conditions were clear and other aircraft were observable with readily detectable nav-marker lighting at similar distance/direction.

Twin steady white Lights, No Sound, Moving ENE to SSW.;2006-10-30 19:15:00;2 minutes;Twin steady white Lights, No Sound, Moving ENE to SSW. Observed twin WHITE lights very close together (as one object), moving from ENE to SSW. Altitude estimated @ 1,500 - 2,000 feet. Speed estimated @ 100 - 150 mph. No noise what-so-ever. No anti-collision lights seen either...Just the 2 steady white lights. Object moving toward Orlando International Airport, but opposite the other traffic flow observed from aircraft taking off/landing. Sky conditions were basically clear with some haze seen at higher altitudes. What made me finally decide to make a report was the fact that as the object moved from my left (North) and eventually departed from view to my extreme right (South), was that there was NO change in the aspect of the lights as one would expect if said lights were those of an aircraft's landing lights...even when the object was travelling AWAY from me the lights were the same.

Possible Plane chasing ufo ???;2007-04-14 21:00:00;5 minutes;Possible Plane chasing ufo ??? I am hesistant to report this as an actual ufo...but the sighting was strange enough to mention. I was at a local gas station talking to some friends and saw what I first thought were two (2) planes on nearly converging vectors. #1 was coming from South to North & the other (#2) from West to East. There was likely less than 1,000 feet of distance between them at the nearest point. At the cross-over point the #1 craft (ufo?) was seen to only have RED lights...whereas the #2 craft was a normally appearing/sounding plane. At this point the plane veered swiftly left as if to chase the #1 object. The #1 (ufo?) proceeded into a left (West) turn and was closely followed by the #2 craft (plane). The plane was never able to catch the #1 object but seemed to stay in trail by perhaps a distance of 1,000 feet. They continued in a West-Northwest direction till out of sight. I observed the objects with a small pair of binoculars and could readily ID the #2 craft as a light plane, but could NOT do so with the #1 object. All I saw on the #1 craft was RED lights EXCEPT for one instant when I observed a WHITE light at the rear as it was moving West away from me.  I just had a feeling that the #2 aircraft had just taken off from Orlando Executive Airport and saw the unknown & recognized it as such and decided suddenly to try and get closer to get a better look.  Hope I'm not being out of line for reporting this incident...but it just had that sense of unusual that made me wonder.

Twin White Lights seen as Possible UFO;2007-05-20 22:00:00;30 seconds;Twin White Lights seen as Possible UFO Observed two (2) white lights (looked like airplane landing lights), moving from South to North from a distance of approx. 1 -  2 miles. Light were approx. 100 - 150 feet apart, but moved as if a single solid object connected them. Speed was quite fast but not excessive if it were a plane. However, I did observe the lights turn toward the West (away from me) in an approx. 80 degree bank and rapidly move away. NO flashing lights, or such seen, even thru small binoculars, just the two steady white lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Large Orange light or fire ball over Orlando traveling E to W without falling and with no tail, then disappeared.;2012-01-19 19:00:00;10 minutes;Large Orange light or fire ball over Orlando traveling E to W without falling and with no tail, then disappeared. There was a large Orange fire ball over South Orlando that was not an airplane nor a helicopter and couldn't have been a flare because there was never a tail and it was traveling from East to West without falling for quite some distance.  At one point there were very large sparks coming off one side that appeared to go up and out in an arc for the most part.  Many of us were on the porch of a restaurant in Celebration FL and we all witnessed it.  It didn't act or appear as falling space debris would either.   After traveling for a couple of miles straight from East to West is when it appeared to stop in mid air and the sparks came out.  It sat there for some time after that before it finally just disappeared in that same spot...without falling.  It also changed color to a greenish then white color then back to the orange glow.  It was too far from us to tell if there was sound or what shape it may have been.  There were other aircraft in the vicinity and this loo! ked completely different than those.   What was that?;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Strange Deep-pitched Droning Sound and Loud, Muffled Booms.;2013-12-19 03:00:00;2 hours;Strange Deep-pitched Droning Sound and Loud, Muffled Booms Although this is not a SIGHTING, it is a continuing, and growing, mystery. Starting on December 19, 2013, and continuing every night for over a week, I heard a deep-pitched droning sound, punctuated by a loud, but muffled BOOM.  Sometimes the BOOM only happened once or twice.  Other times, it would sound a number of times, in rapid succession.  This went on almost night for over a month.  It then became several times a week, and continues to this day.  I heard it this morning, at about 4:30AM, and listened to it for an hour.  There was no BOOM today...just the deep-pitched droning sound.  My husband has even heard it a couple of times. As for the DIRECTION of the sound, it seems to be from above, kind of in an umbrella sort of way. Over the last month or so, I have contacted Patrick Air Force Base...NASA...a tech person who works for a local gas company...the 2 local airports...NONE of these folks had an explanation for the sound.  However, the NASA person said that I was the 3rd or 4th person to call NASA about a loud, deep humming sound and some weird explosions. I have reported this already to my LOCAL ORLANDO area MUFON investigator...DINAH LECHNER...and we have been working on it together. So, far, other than finding stories of folks in other areas who have heard similar mysterious sounds, nothing yet... In the report, I clikced on object, since this sound and boom have to come from SOMETHING, but no object has actually been seen at this time. Now, I turn to you, NUFORC. THANK YOU for any help you can give with this mystery.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Peculiar movements of an object with green (and some white) lights.;2013-12-28 22:00:00;15-30 minutes;Peculiar movements of an object with green (and some white) lights. I was in downtown Orlando on the evening of December 28 around 10pm and saw an object with a dominate green light, and maybe a white light as well.  It jumped up in the sky.  It the hovered very high above the skyline, made a circle, then dropped below the building and went right to left very quickly.   I could not see the shape of the craft, kind of like a satellite where you usually just see the light. I see planes, blimps, satellites, luminaries,  and other known objects quite often, I have never seen something move like this fast and covering this distance.  New drone or military would be my guess...weird. Talked with several folks that say it as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

We saw what appeared to be traditional red/green navigation lights moving exceedingly fast across the sky, E to W, downward arc.;2014-04-19 21:30:00;3 minutes;As a pilot of 10 years and owner of two aircraft, I am quite accustomed to seeing all sorts of lights in the sky, both on the ground and while operating aircraft. Viewing a map of the area, it seems to be approximately 7-10 miles northwest of the Kissimmee/International Gateway Airport.  The tower closed at 9:00pm local time. I was on the ground, having just stepped out of a restaurant on west International Drive in a relatively dark area.  We saw what appeared to be traditional red/green navigation lights moving exceedingly fast across the sky, east to west, in a downward arc.  Thinking this was an aircraft in distress, I expected to see an explosion as it hit the ground.  Instead, it stopped behind a building in the distance and climbed in a completely vertical approximately 200-300 feet, then it stopped and made and IMMEDIATE right turn to the North/Northwest. In my experience, there is no fixed wing or rotorcraft that can possibly move at the speeds this object moved or execute the maneuvers of this object.  The forces exerted on this aircraft would either rip the apart the airframe or cause severe damage to the pilot's internal organs. There was no sound associated with this aircraft.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

Both seemed stationary and there was no engine sound, but it was a good distance off.   After a minute or two, both lights came closer and a third light appeared as the first to came closer.   Over the next several minutes all three had passed my field of vision.

Audio event of unknown origin.;2015-01-11 05:15:00;~1 hour;Audio event of unknown origin. January 11, 2015.  Today started with a NOISE. At about 5:13 this morning, I woke up...and I heard it right away. A deep, droning sound...more than just a HUM...and with a “mechanical” quality to it. I listened to it for a couple minutes, then got up to go to the bathroom...giggled to myself, thinking I was just hearing my bladder rumble. No, that wasn't it... I could hear it in the bathroom... And all throughout the house !!  After leaving the loo, I went into every room, and looked out the windows, and UP. But the sky was very overcast, and I couldn't see anything. As much as I wanted to go outside and look, there was “something” that told me not to do so...this morning was not a cool time to do so...and I have to admit, the sound was a bit eerie. The most intense aspect of it was NOT just the noise itself...but HOW it seemed to be... The best way I can described it would be that it seemed to “encapsulate” our house...as if a bowl had been put over us, upside down. And yes, to me, this noise was LOUD...quite a bit louder than the HUM I regularly hear when I really listen. So I went back to bed, and lay still and listened. All the while this was happening, the cats were glued to me. Not freaking out and running around the house, but trying to stay as close to me as they could. And when I came back to bed, and lay on my right side, 3 of them lay on the top of my left side...3 more lay right next to me as close as they could get...and several more were on the dressers  After about 45 minutes more, it stopped...as if someone had flipped a switch. It didn't “fade away”...it was just suddenly GONE. The silence was very intense...made the hairs on my arms and neck stand on end... Several of the cats came slowly over to the bedroom window to look out...and yes, they looked UP. And for the life of me, I could NOT get back to sleep. My husband, ((name deleted)), woke up to go to the bathroom around 8AM, and I asked him if he had any weird dreams or such...he said NO, but felt that the house was creepily quiet. And no, I did NOT wake him up during the NOISE... I had wanted to, but couldn't figure out HOW to do so without planting the suggestion of “hearing something weird” in his head...THAT would have affected his experience. So now I must investigate this, to see if anyone has reported such an experience to MUFON and NUFORC. Everything I learn, I will write down, for my own records. ((NUFORC Note:  If anyone in the Orlando area was witness to the sound, we would like to invite them to submit a written report, to supplement the report above.

Glowing lights behind cloud hovered, then moved in similar directions at a high rate.  Return to original position.;2017-07-27 02:16:00;10-15 minutes;Glowing lights behind cloud hovered, then moved in similar directions at a high rate.  Return to original position. I was driving North on the 429 heading to Orlando at 2:16 AM, when I saw 5 lights in a straight line shining through the clouds.  They were as big as the moon, but I could not see any objects because they were shining behind clouds.  They were spaced equally, one object being able to fill the gap between the other.  I figured they were spotlights from Disney, but I realized Disney was behind me and there was nothing else that would shine spotlights at 2 AM.  I kept an eye on them, but they suddenly zoomed out as fast as a meteorite travels across the sky.  I couldn't see where they went the first time as I was driving. A few moments later they zoomed back to their original formation. I put my hazards on and pulled off the road.  I tried getting it on video, but it was too dark.  They traveled in a straight line, but in slightly different angles so they were spaced evenly, but farther separated from each other when I looked behind me.  I sat there watching them for about 10 minutes, but they finally zoomed out of view and never came back.  They zoomed out and in probably 2 times in a span of 5 minutes.  They mostly hovered.  They disappeared for about a few minutes, but they came back and zoomed in and out for maybe another 2 or 3 times in a period of 5 minutes.  I ruled out spotlights since they flew out of range that a spotlight has.  It was apparent that they were behind the clouds, and not light being projected onto them.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

And I noticed these lights behind a tree and I didn't have my glasses on so I didn't think nothing of it.  They sat there for about 5 minutes or so until something clicked in my head.  That thing's been sitting there a long time planes  Do not sit in one spot. it appeared to be closed yet the object was pretty decent size in the sky.  Relative to the tree I was looking at a few hundred yards away it appeared to be not to be much higher than the trees and guessing their relative size of a medium-sized plane. I'm voice typing.  When I realized that thing was acting odd by not moving and the shape of it was hard to explain since I have stigmatism I want know if it's correct.  Anyways when I started filming it it started to move slow and it moved behind a tree not level with the tree.  I don't know how to explain this I did video tape it but couldn't get it to clear up and show everything I was seeing. I thought maybe it was a large drone or a military crafts.  But then I read a guy named Sosa's on here and what he seen pretty much describes what I seen.  It's slowly passing the head and acted sort of like a helicopter but it didn't look like one.  I'm not really certain but I do have videotape.  I hope you guys can read this.  Maybe it's a military crafts and they're waiting to see what kind of reports they get on i   It had one bright light and then a few lights behind it that were smaller one was blinking.  I really can't explain what I seen I've not seen it before.  Because I was standing near my central air and heat I couldn't hear the motor.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

2 craft-in trail formation-both-ENGULFED IN FIRE- no sound.;2019-08-30 20:15:00;3 minutes;2 craft - in trail formation - both- INGULFED IN FIRE- no sound. Friady evening about 8:15 eastern time. Orlando fl. about 4 miles due north of Orlando international airport. They sky was 100% overcast-- looked to be 6 or 8,000 feet up--- as the departing jetliners at probably 4 and 5,000 were below it. I was outside making prepirations for the the approaching hurricane Dora (sic.  Dorian). Just at begining of twilight.  Stepped out of my shop to look at a virgin atlantic 747 departing for europe.  (Reckegnised it by its sound.) As I watched it go by south to north- I was facing east and it was passing above my eastern horizon and tree line in the distance.  It was about 5 miles away so I turned go inside and my eyes caught a light just over the trees as I was facing due east. At first I assumed it was some kind of plane because the sky was full of departing and approaching - both near and far.  Immediately I noticed that whatever it was appeared to be on fire.   And it was headed my way with some speed.   I thought -- if thats a plane-- he wont be flying much longer with THAT MUCH fire.  whatever it was -- it appeared to be engulfed in fire from every part of it.   I could see flames blowing out of it from all sides. I briefly thought of running away as it seemed to be heading right for me-- at least in its heading.  It seemed to be holding its altitude--- not descinding at all.  I ran to my shop door- about 20 feet away where I often keep binoculars hanging on a cabinet door-- but they were gone. I got my cheap flip phone and put it on video--- tried to center it in the screen--- and them tried to zoom it while keeping the object in the screen. By that time it was about directly overhead . I could hear NO NOISE at all.  So I rulled out a plane or a drone.  I could still see flames blowing out of it on every side - like it was a fire that was being actively fed---- I could also see NO smoke trail like a plane might have made (especially a jet- if it had burning jet fuel- which would have been very smokey---)  i believe after the video ends--- I continued to watch it untill it disappeared behind the western tree line. My mind was kind of overwhelmed trying to figure out what I had just seen-----  I stood there a moment-- and turned around and saw another one of the same thing above the easter tree line---- exactly like the first. I tried to get another video but only got a few sec. of this one.   I also watched this one approach the western tree like like the first one did.   It seemed to be engulfed in fire just like the first one.  just brfore it got down to the tree line--- I saw what appeared to be a halo appear which looked like a half sphere. It lasted about 2 or 3 sec.   ( reminded me of the umbrella shaped plume when a rocket's 2-nd stage lights at the edge of space--) It looked like I was looking at the back end of this thing- and the halo was symetrical around it--- After about 2 or 3 sec. of this halo---- all the fire abruptly ended----- I strained to look--- and I could see a distinct outline of some kind of dark object with sharply defined edges. The sky still has a little diffuse light and I could see it highlighted against it.  with only having my naked eye--- I  couldnt quite tell if its shape was square or cylindrical ro what geeometrical shape it looked like-- just that I could see sharp well defined edges---- and the fact that it seemed to be very large. Just before the fire ceased--- its position merged with that of a jetliner about 4 miles away (departing the furthet of the 4 runways) and its angular size appeared about 4 times bigger than the distant plane.  Of coarse I have no distance information-- all I know is that it was below the cloud deck.  Since the clouds were 100% -- if it had been above them I never could seen it at all.  The distant jetliners were probably 6 or 8,000 feet I woul dguess and they were below the cloud deck too.  So it had to be below that.   My first impression upon seeing the first one was that it was maybe 3000 or 4000 feet (when I thought it was a plane on fire---)  The time between the first one and 2-nd one was maybe 30 sec.  I would guess they may have taken 1 min to go from tree line to tree line.  I truely can not guess what this could have been.  It did NOT seem to resemble any UFO report I have ever heard. I checked the wind about a half an hour later.  It was out of the NE and the objects were going very close to from east to west.   The only thing I could think of was some of those rigs that people some times release that have a white paper bag with a candle below---like a hot air baloon.  However it didnt seem to be following the wind-- and if it was a paper bag that had caught on fire --THAT would have burned up within a few sec. as well as loosing its ability to remain aloft.  It would have droped like a rock.  At one point when I was watching the first object coming towards me---- I all most thought I could see a tiny faint steady point of light on each side of the fire-- like just near the outer edges of the fire. All most like a very faint wing tip light.  The only other thing I might immagine it could be ---- was some kind of upper atmosphere-near space plasma or electric discharge powered plane.  That might explain the appearance of a billowing fire--- the halo---- no noise--- an another thing.  The course these things were on -- was just about exactly the path I used to see air force planes commuting from Patric AFB (near port canaveral) to McDill AFB (Tampa).  I wonder if that --- and the fact there was a 2-nd one in trail behind the first one--- is a hint that maybe the air force was involved ????? That was what I saw !  It was very odd !;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Large sparkle: seen MULTIPLE nights in a row;2020-04-26 02:30:00;15 minutes;Large sparkle: seen MULTIPLE nights in a row Large golden sparkle at night. It has been appearing almost every night since the 26th. It is impossible to properly discern the true shape of the object because of how sparkly it looks, but if I were to wager my best guess, it would possibly be cigar-shaped. It also appears to pulse if you look closely at it, but it does not blink. It never appears as any other color but gold.  When visible, the object will either sit in one place or slowly drift around. It was observed moving quickly only once it disappeared behind some trees and then suddenly reappeared in its original position.  The times it appears, the directions it moves in, the speed it moves at, and its altitude have not followed any discernible patterns. However, it consistently appears in the same general place on the skyline.  It will stay visible anywhere from 2-30 minutes in the sky. It has appeared, left within 15 minutes, and reappeared some number of hours later on one occasion.  I've never submitted one of these reports before.  This is the first time I have observed such an object.  Two other people have witnessed this object with me. None of us has a background in science or the military.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
