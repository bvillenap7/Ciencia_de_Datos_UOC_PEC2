When I lift my head up and was looking towards the sky. I noticed this bright object in the air.  At firset I though it was a couple of planes. But to my surprise it was a UFO floating in the air. It looked like a mountain of diamonds brightly shinning. It was floating down. Under the bottom of the objcet it had like a black shadow. I couldn't believe my eyes.  I ran downstair to my friends house and told her to come outside and to see this UFO. By the time she came out the UFO was still there and she saw it.  It was floating down and going behind a building. I notice that it was alot of plans flying around the area. Some planes ere flying very low also their where flying in a circle. on Sunday, December 12, 1999 at appriomately around 8:10 pm I went outside on my patio to take my mop out.  I drop some matches on the ground I bend down to pick them up. When I lift my head up and notice this bright thing in the sky. At first I thought it was a bunch of planses of something.  I looked again and I notice that it was not.  It was a bright around cirle of lights floating in the sky. The more I looked it looked like a custer of diamonds. It was bright ligths and had an oval shape on top.  and under the bottom of the round circle. It look like a black round shadow under it.  At first I could believe it.  I ran down to my firend house and  told her to come outside and to see this UFO. I told her to hurray, hurray. When she came outside we ran to the area and I pointed the UFO to her. It was floating and getting lower. As it got lower it went behind this building and we could see it again.  While all this was going on I notice all these planes flying around in a circle.  Some the planes were flying very low. some were moving very fast. The UFO was in my area of town for about 5 to 8 minutes. But the planes kept on flying around in the sky. My friend called her daughter boyfriend out of the house to show him, but by the time he came out it had dissapeared. But the planes were still circlieg around the the area. We stood out for about 40 minutes waiting to see if we could see it again.  We even went driving around to see if the could try to find the location where it may have landed. I went back upstairs and try to use my computer and it was not working right.  The next day when I went to work the computers on the job was nothing working right.  Another friend i was just talking and she mention to me that her computers on the job was down for some reason.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

It was a brownish color and had a few smaller ones. It made a strange wavy sound, like it was floating. The UFO was not moving to fast but was clearly not of earth origin. It proceeded across the sky until out of sight. Also worth mentioning, there were jets flying around where the object had been scene the next day.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

This object is blinking colors that are very bright and vibrant. Like LED's and multiple colors. Its odd because protruding from the object is what appears to be a long strip.  That strip has blinking LED lights on it that are green red and blue.  They keep flashing and i have absolutly no idea what this could possibly be.  I have never seen anything like it in my entire life.. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

Sitting here watching planes by MCO airport and what i thought was a bird at first stopped and hovered then i realized it was too high in the air and was reflecting the sunlight it changed directions a couple times and hovering like it was looking for something and when it moved, it made the airbuses to appear to be moving real slow, i took of my sunglasses for a better look but could barely see it without them, then it headed south and within 10 seconds, it was gone.   There's not a cloud in the sky, and the airliners are not reflecting light, like this thing was. You can also see the moon out during the day today, there were about 3 planes at various heights during the event.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
