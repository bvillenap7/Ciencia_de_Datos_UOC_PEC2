Rounded rectangle of a cluster of frosted raspberry lights slowly moving north, then, swiftly gone...;1997-10-23 21:00:00;approx. 10 minutes;Rounded rectangle of a cluster of frosted raspberry lights slowly moving north, then, swiftly gone... At approximately 9p.m., I went to my car after an outdoor concert on the campus of the local university. I was waiting for the traffic from the parking lot to subside, when I happened to look up, towards the southwestern sky. Up, almost directly overhead, was a cluster of lights, in a rounded rectangle, almost oval form. They were an odd color, kind of a frosted raspberry. Though I believe that it was one object, it may have been one object for each light. It looked motionless, then moved very slowly in a northerly direction. It was rather far up, and I could detect no sound. Suddenly, it was gone. Though it seemed as though the lights simply blinked out, somehow I could tell that whatever they were attached to had moved away. There was a very slight trail. Did I mention that this object seemed to be quite large? When I got home, I called the local airports and blimp station, and was told that there had been no blimp or other advertising-based air activity that evening.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
This object almost seemed alive;1999-05-05 02:00:00;05 minutes;This object almost seemed alive I can best describe this thing as a spinning comma . It looked like a small balloon that had been popped and was falling out of the sky , only spinning counter- clockwise and moving right to left, tumbling ,sort of .Just like a comma,a black disc with a short tail, 2 ft. across. It came floating by and I saw it ,not losing altitude,travel approx. 1/2 mile strait into an approaching thunder storm cloud. For three or four minutes,I watched as it darted in and out of this cloud very fast in fifty foot circles as lightning came down out of the cloud. This occurred approx. 2 mi. north of Orlando Interntl. airport. This event occurred in early afternoon with clear skies as a storm approached. At the time I worked for ((deleted)) Corp., as a ((deleted)) operator, manufacturing ((deleted)) parts. ---------Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  Graphic image provided.  We may post it.

I seen 2 star looking object move across the sky;2000-04-27 12:30:00;app. 15;I seen 2 star looking object move across the sky I have witnessed a UFO before while camping out on daytona beach, orlando, FL. late One night around 12:30 at night. While I lay there on my blanket relaxing and staring at the stars an object that looked just like a star and was so high it could have passed as one was slowly moving across the sky, it just slowly moved across the sky for a minute then suddenly vanished. Not knowing what I had just seen I continued to stare up into the stars. approximately 10 minutes later It appeared again only going the opposite way. The 2 objects I witnessed that night were going way to slow to be a shooting star or comet. It could have possibly been a satellite but then why did it suddenly disappear and then appear again going the other direction. I now know the truth that we are not alone and that the government has been hiding the hard evidence for many years.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
A CLOUD WITH A LIGHT INSIDE THAT DISSIPATED;2001-06-25 21:00:00;2 MIN.;A CLOUD WITH A LIGHT INSIDE THAT DISSIPATED I WAS LOOKING TO THE EAST FROM THE EAST SIDE OF ORLANDO FLORIDA AND I SAW A CLOUD WITH A LIGHT INSIDE. I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A HELICOPTER SPRAYING FOR MOSQUITOES, BUT IT WASN'T MAKING ANY NOISE. I LOOKED AT THE SKY BEHIND ME AND THE SKY WAS CLEAR. MY NEIGHBOR ASKED ME WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS, AND IT JUST DISSIPATED INTO NOTHING. MY WIFE AND HER MOTHER WERE DRIVING ON THE FLORIDA TURNPIKE HEADING SOUTHEAST FROM GA. AND SAW THIS. A CO-WORKER TOLD ME TODAY [6-27-01]THAT HE AND HIS WIFE SAW THE SAME THING IN THE EASTERN SKY AT AROUND 21OO HOURS FROM DELAND, FL. HAS ANYONE ELSE REPORTED SEEING THIS? MY NEIGHBOR SAYS IT COULD BE SWAMP GAS, BUT I SAW A BRIGHT LIGHT. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the cluster of reports that appear her for the evening of Monday, June 25, 2001, were caused by the launch of an ICBM by the U. S. Navy from the Kennedy Space Center at approximately 2115 hrs. (EDT).  We are grateful to the FAA Military Liason office in Jacksonville, FL the USAF 45th RANDS unit and the Naval Operations and Testing Unit (NOTU) for their assistance in our attempt to determine the cause of these reports.

At approximately 6:00a.m., I witnessed an odd, oval, slightly glowing object (12 or so)move in a zig-zag pattern and at extreme speed.;2004-04-15 06:00:00;Approximately 2-3 minutes;At approximately 6:00a.m., I witnessed an odd, oval, slightly glowing object (12 or so) move in a zig-zag pattern and at extreme speed. At approximately 6:00a.m. today, I awoke to take our dog for her early morning constitutional. Everyone in the house knows I have a thing for looking out of the windows when I first wake up, maybe to make certain the World is still here...anyway, I walked across the living room and looked out of the window behind the love seat.  At first, I thought it was a bird...but, I realized that birds don't glow. Then I looked more closely at the shape...kind of oval, but more like when you cup your hands and put them together, and roughly twice that size...the difference being that where your fingertips would come together, there was a dark wedge shape dividing the 2 halves, but only half way down. I didn't see any head, or tail, nor feet...just this shape. And the glowing was a muted glow, not bright, and the color was somewhere between a light grey and white. And it was pulsating, but only slightly.  The next thing I know, one of the stray kittens we feed came bounding around the corner of the house and pounced at it...that is when I became absolutely certain it was not a bird. It moved so fast, from a completely stationary position, faster than anything I have ever seen move, at least in person and not on the big screen... The pattern of its movement was a sloppy zig-zag, and it moved at about the height of the cat's head...maybe 10 inches off the ground. After about 2 zigs and one zag, all the while staying ahead of the cat, they both disappeared around the corner of another house...  Again, as it moved, there was no sound...no tail...no wings...and nothing that could have been a head...it retained its cupped hands shape the entire time.  I went to see if I could find any trace of it, and there was nothing.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

Silver pill-shaped object viewed over Disney World in Florida;2010-07-08 15:00:00;45 sec;Silver pill-shaped object viewed over Disney World in Florida It was an afternoon and my family was on a trip to Orlando. We were heading back to the hotel via Monorail.  I looked out into the sky for a moment and saw an object hovering in the distance that didnâ€™t resemble any aircraft or the shapes in your drop-down menu of choices. The object was a dull silver, with light from the sun reflecting off of it. It was shaped like a compressed pill.  A cylinder with a dome on the top and bottom.  In the place where the dome forms from the straight side of the object, there was a line that goes straight across the object to the other side. This applied to the lower half of the object as well. After 45 sec or so of staring at the object, I decide to look away to see if it was an illusion in my eyes.  I look back less than 5 sec later, and the object is gone.  I scan the skies on both sides of the Monorail, but I was unable to see the object.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Silver objects falls in orlando sky 1/25/13;2013-01-25 14:30:00;2-4 minutes;Silver objects falls in orlando sky 1/25/13 My friend and i were sitting outside by his pool when he asked me did i see that thing falling.  It took me a second but i saw something silver that was in a controlled fall.   I could tell it was flipping as it fell because it would reflect light like it was twinkling.  It didn't fall at a normal rate but looked very controlled almost like it was floating down.   My friend and i watched it for about 5 minutes until it disappeared behind the tree line.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

My son and I witnessed a strange light which we thought was a helicopter with its full lights on.  When we looked closer there was  smaller flashing things below the main bright craft in a triangle shape, it almost looked like fire works but way to high and lasted way to long.  I rushed home to see if the space station blew up or something.   Strange!!!   After they disappeared there was a cloud that turned almost floresant;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
4 groups of 2 orange/red boxes of what appeared to be firelike light seen in central Florida.;2013-10-19 20:45:00;10-15 minutes;4 groups of 2 orange/red boxes of what appeared to be firelike light seen in central Florida. It was last Saturday, 10/19/2013 at approximately 8:45 PM, I was leaving my mom's home in north east Orlando area (College Park).  I was facing her reminding her to lock up when I turned to walk down the driveway to my car, I saw 2 boxes of orange/reddish light looking like fire coming toward me.  They were coming from the north east sky between the two homes across the street.  They appeared to be almost floating toward me with no sound, and no movement other than straight forward movement when the first object began heading south west and the second object appeared to reach the same point and follow it.    I was telling my mom what I saw, and when I turned to point out where I saw them first, there appeared another orange box coming from the same area with another seen following it.   They both changed direction at the same place the first two did and moved south west.  I watched them until they got smaller and smaller and when I turned back to where they had come from, there was another headed toward me, with one behind it.  Again they moved to approximately the same area and turned toward the south west.   I got into my car and moved to the end of the road and watched 2 more boxes of fire looking light moving across the sky towards the south west following the others.  I saw, in approximately 10-15 minutes of time, 4 groups of orange/red boxes in sets of 2... all originating from the same area and moving off to the south west toward the city of Orlando. To my naked eye, they appeared to be boxes of fire, they did not glow, but seemed to radiate color, almost iridescent looking.  My first thought when I saw them was perhaps hot air balloons, but it was night, I saw nothing above the boxes, and they made no sound.  I then thought perhaps paper lanterns, but they each followed the first one, and appeared to move in the same pattern.  They also were in groups of two.   As I saw the first one come toward me, I could see another smaller following it, and when the first one headed in the south west direction, the following one was still coming forward and getting bigger until it headed south west and followed the first.  Then about 2-3 minutes later another group of 2 was seen.  Prior to this sighting at approx 7:30 PM, I had heard several deep booms like fireworks being set off somewhere.  I went out at that time and saw nothing, it was partially cloudy that night and I figured the cloud cover had accentuated the fireworks from the Disney area and that was what I heard.   I am not sure that this had anything to do with this sighting or not, but thought it should be mentioned.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
