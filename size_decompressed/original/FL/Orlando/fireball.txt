MULITPLE ORANGE BALLS OF LIGHT WITNESSED IN ORLANDO, FLORIDA. 9 WITNESSES NO HOAX;2008-04-12 23:45:00;15-20 minutes;MULITPLE ORANGE BALLS OF LIGHT WITNESSED IN ORLANDO, FLORIDA. 9 WITNESSES NO HOAX At around aprox. 11:30p.m I was shooting pool at a pub about 2 miles from where I live when we received a phone call from a good friend that lives a block away from me told me to walk outside and that there were multiple orange balls of light in the sky. Me and the 2 other guys I was with shooting pool walked outside to the parking lot but failed to see anything and went back inside. We talked to Randy ( person who called us ) again after going back inside and he said they were more of them apearing and that some of them were hovering in the south. I was so anxious to see this that I jumped on my motorcycle without even paying my bar tab. When I got home I was finally able to see the bright orange balls in the sky. I ran inside to wake the rest of the family up and they too witnessed the orange balls of light. We must have witnessed up to 5 of the objects in the sky at once, sometimes they appeared to be hovering and then would move slowly from the west to the east coast ( cocoa beach florida )up to 20 of them were witnessed. The new ones would come as if someone turned on a light in the sky and once they got far on the east coast out of are atmosphere they apeared to turn light blue almost like a star but continued to fly in mysterious patterns. I called the police to see if there were any other reports of strange orange balls of light in the sky or if the military was testing and they had no answer but yet after talking to my friend Randy that called me he said before I got home from the pub he and his wife and kid witnessed military jets chasing the balls of light. My friend was able to get a couple still frame photos and are in possetion right now. I am really lost for words I have never seen anything like that in my life and I am even a pyrotechnic. Please let me know if you need anymore details, Thanks.  Matt;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Bright orange/red half-moon looking object with what looked like a wavy flame tail.;2008-04-14 03:20:00;2 - 4 mins;Bright orange/red half-moon looking object with what looked like a wavy flame tail. it was around 3:20am me and my Friend who was out picking up some donuts, going down the road next to our house. heading north. when we got down to the road we needed to turn at head to the donut shop, about 100 - 75Ft i saw over the tree tops a orange half-moon shape object in the sky, at first when i saw it i tough it was a half-blood moon. but when i saw it. it looked like it was about two - two and a half time lager than the moon we see in the night sky. it was a very bight orange. it only got to see it for about 2 - 3 secs until we turned down t the road,i told my Friend (who was the one driving) he wanted to see it but it was a bit to late at the moment. then when we turned to the road going to the shop, for about 3 - 4 Min's ride to the shop. i saw it a few more time over the north west area where i seen it the first time, by the time i seen it the 3rd time, it didn't look like no blood moon to me, it looked more like a huge fire ball. where i saw some wave coming from the back of it. and every time i saw it i told my Friend to look but he was always to late to see it. and he really wanted to see it. so after we got our donuts, came back. i was looking over there again to the north west area heading home on the sane. path it was around 3:35. and it wasn't there by the time we got back home i tough to myself, that couldn't been the moon since the moon can not go around the earth that fast with in such a small time frame, then i realized that was the north west area, and the moon cant go over in that are since the moon raises from the east and sets into the west. it was strange. when i did see it. it looks like it was slowly moving downwards to the earth, with the naked it it looked about a good 100 - 150ft big. might of been bigger. so i started to looking more into this, and i couldn't really explain what it was. all i know was it was a huge flame looking thing in the sky.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

It flew directly over the international airport in south Orlando.   I wondered about it for weeks not hearing anything about it, until I saw a video on YouTube from China showing a ball flying over an airport on the same night, now I been seeing dozens of reports, so cool, but I feel different now when I go outside and look at the sky.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Bright Object - Large White Fiery Ball with Bright Green Trail Fell to Earth;2011-08-11 22:35:00;3 seconds;Bright Object - Large White Fiery Ball with Bright Green Trail Fell to Earth Tonight, August 11, 2011, approximately 10:35 pm, I saw a very large what I believe might be a meteor crash to earth.  The only difference is the color, I’ve seen a minimum of 6 meteors and all were fiery red with a red trail.  The ball on this one was extremely bright white with a beautiful bright green trail.  It only appeared for 2 to 3 seconds.  It was heading in a westerly direction towards Orlando International Airport in the Lake Nona/Moss Park area in Orlando, Florida.  It was amazing and very large.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

My entire family saw the event.  I'm not a believer, but this was undeniable occurrence.  The first one we saw went up and split into two and traveled into space at the same rate.  The next five were all in a single file line appearing in the same area. It looked like the fire trail from a Space Shuttle launch at night.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Red-Orange fireball passing over Orlando on Dec 30th 2011;2011-12-30 19:00:00;5 min.;Red-Orange fireball passing over Orlando on Dec 30th 2011 On Dec. 30th 2011 at around 7pm in Orlando, FL. I spotted a bright round reddish-orange fireball around magnitude -15 about 1/3 the dia. of the moon traveling north at about 2,000 ft and 200 mph. It stayed the same size, brightness and shape, the outer edges looked like it was flickering like a fire. I first thought it was a jet on fire and called my wife and daughter out to see it. After watching it for a minute we reallized there was no sound, smoke or trail coming off of it. We got out two binoculars and could not see any more detail, we watched it for about four to five minutes heading north toward sanford slowly getting dimmer and finally disapearing into a cloudbank. We saw several Jets nearby making thier final approach into OIA Airport and could easly tell it looked quit a bit larger and was traveling opposite of the approach path. We are advide astronomers and astrophotographers and we have never seen anything like this, we know what Iridium flares and such looks like. It was by far the best thing we have ever seen!;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

I was watching this do it for a good 20 mins before I called my girlfriend who lives about 40 mins drive away to look up and see if she could see anything?  Well sure enough her and her daughter both saw a huge bright around 8 pm.  And it looked like a ball that is flying or burning with flames in blue orange and white, I thought it might be a planet being obstructed by clouds but after I see no clouds it has me wondering what it really was!  This went on for just over an hour and the flashing was irregular. I do have it recorded on camcorder but it's not very clear :(  although u can see the light go from bright to dim.

They looked like orange orbs. We watched them fly over a few minutes then they disappeared.  A couple minutes later another one came out over the trees, following the same path, then another.  The last one was the strangest one though. It was changing altitudes. It started coming down, then it started going up and started moving at a faster speed.

Orange balls gliding through the sky over Orlando;2012-11-13 17:10:00;7-10 minutes;Orange balls gliding through the sky over Orlando I was walking my dog on the evening of November 13, 2012 at approximately 6:10pm when I saw this orange ball in the sky and thought it looked odd.  I live near Orlando International Airport so I know what planes look like at night.  This was not a jet plane.  I stopped to watch it and then I saw several more orange balls gliding from the north looking as if they were following each other.  Then several more came so I ran inside for my camera.  I took some pictures but they don’t do what I saw justice.  It looked like someone was tossing these balls into the atmosphere because they just gliding by, not far from the tree tops, and made no noise.  They were beautiful and I stood there in amazement watching them.  I can’t explain what they are but I know what I saw.  They were following each other sometimes just one and sometimes in a group of three.  They followed each other out to the west.  I am a pet groomer in Orlando and am always out with my dogs.  I have never seen anything like this before and I watch the jets coming and going all the time.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Orange Fireballs in Southern Sky, Orlando, Florida;2013-01-01 20:35:00;2-3 minutes;Orange Fireballs in Southern Sky, Orlando, Florida On 1/1/2013, @ approx  2035 hrs I observed 5 or 6 orange glowing objects in the southern sky (S to SSE). I live in Eastern Orange County, Fl, approx 12 miles east of the Orlando Intl Airport (OIA) in a rural type area.  The objects appeared in a somewhat vertical line but were staggered behind each other at different altitudes and fairly low on the horizon.  It appeared as if the objects were floating or traveling slowly to the north.  These objects appeared to be lower than the air traffic in the area that was departing from OIA.   The air traffic appeared to be initially departing to the south and then turning crosswind to the east and then turning toward a north departure from the Orlando area.  It was very apparent that the orange glowing objects were not aircraft.  I watched the objects for approx 1 min and the ran into the house to get my wife and son.  Upon returning to the front yard, we saw 3 remaining orange glowing objects in the sky.  Apparently the other! 2 or 3 objects had disappeared.  Two of the three remaining glowing objects faded quickly while heading in a easterly direction.  The last object continued to glow but slowly faded as it traveled in an easterly direction and it appeared to gain altitude until it was out of sight.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

About 16:45 Orlando, FL 32812   I saw two groups of three each large orange glowing balls travel across the sky from East to West. While they were in two groups, they didn't appear to flying in a tight type of formation such as military craft would.  As they reached the Western area, they began to fade quickly until they were no longer visible.  They didn't appear to speed off but, rather fade away from bright orange to gone. They were moving very fast across the sky. It took only about one minute or so to travel across my field of view from East horizon to West horizon.  However, I still got a good sustained view.  They appeared to be large and low in the sky.  The location is in the flight path of Orlando International Airport and I watch planes every day and night.   I have never seen anything even close to looking like these. I heard Peter on Coast to Coast AM talking about sightings like this in other areas of Florida.  I would put this sighting in that same category.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Four Fireballs in Formation over Orlando;2013-08-02 01:30:00;<2 Minutes;Four Fireballs in Formation over Orlando I live 3 miles NW of where the Turnpike and I-4 meet.  As I was driving South around 1:30am this morning I noticed an orange/red fireball in the sky towards where the Turnpike and I-4 meet.  It was circular, almost oval in shape and was traveling North.   At first I thought it was a plane  but it slowed down and looked like it was on fire.  I called my roommate who was at home to look outside as I had just left.  Then I noticed another one in the distance.   As I drove a few more feet, I saw two more.  I wanted to take a picture but was not able to.  I turned West, and as I looked behind I could see they were in a perfect square formation, hovering without movement.   When I returned ten minutes later, they were no longer there.  Upon my return, I did see a helicopter flying in almost the same path as the fireballs.  However, the sheriff helicopters fly around my area at least 4 times a week due to crime rate.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
An orange burning globe floated across the eastern sky in Orlando, Florida at 22:06 on 8/16/2013.;2013-08-16 22:06:00;3 minutes;An orange burning globe floated across the eastern sky in Orlando, Florida at 22:06 on 8/16/2013. At approximately 22:06 on 08/16/13, tonight, I was driving in my neighborhood and talking to a friend on my cellphone.  As I was driving east in my neighborhood I saw an orange globe floating across the eastern sky at a medium slow speed.   At first I thought it might have been aircraft, but it looked so odd to me that I pulled over, shut my engine off, and got out of the car to listen and see if it made any noise in the sky.  It was completely silent which is not conducive to low flying aircraft or helicopters here in Orlando being somewhat near the airports.  This ball had a burning glow effect and it was traveling medium slow.   As a star gazer for years growing up in a very rural area and now after living in Orlando for 5 years, I've never seen anything like it.  I almost wonder if it was some sort of a meteorite.   The night sky was very cloudy and the globe, or rather fireball, was very visible as it was flying beneath the clouds. It also did not blink, twinkle, or make any erratic movements.  I thought I saw a smoke like trail behind it, but I couldn't see that part of it as well, so I'm not certain.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

A second one followed the same path and then a third.   They seemed to be following each other and kept moving steadily away until we could no longer see it.  I have never seen anything like it before.   Definitely not an airplane or helicopter and the shape was hard to determine exactly.  Kind of cylindrical but out of focus because it was glowing.   This is a densely populated residential are (Hunters Creek). ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

No camera or binoculars with me so I needed to take a very good look.  My wife and two kids in the car with me saw it and had no idea what it was.

Plasma ball of fire materializes at exactly same time as thought of previous UFO sighting.;2015-09-22 01:30:00;3-4 seconds;Plasma ball of fire materializes at exactly same time as thought of  previous UFO sighting I had been visiting with a friend who was staying at hotel very close to Sea World in Orlando.  We had been hanging out by the hotel pool.  My friend took my wife to show her where the restrooms were.  They weren't gone 2 minutes when I looked up at the sky and saw what appeared to be a ball of plasma or fire, yellow-orange in color.   The object seemed to materialize, travel a short distance and then de-materialize 3-4 seconds later.  It appeared to be approximately 1000 ft. high and about 500ft. In front of me to the North above FL-528 (Beachline).  It was moving to slow and low to be a meteor. Estimated size approximately 15-20 ft. In diameter.   Behind the object there seemed to be a disturbance in the atmosphere maybe 30 ft. long, and appeared to have a heat shimmer effect.  I don't believe it was ball lighting because there were no storms in the area and even humidity was relatively low for Orlando, this time of year. An interesting couple of notes to this sighting. This 'ball of plasma?' appeared at the exact moment in which I thought of a UFO sighting witnessed by a friend of mine that occurred in a neighborhood less than 2 miles from this one.   Also, there is a major defense/aerospace contractor located less than 2 miles from my sighting.
