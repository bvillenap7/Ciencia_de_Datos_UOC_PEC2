A bright bluesh/green light heading quickly towards the ground.;2008-03-10 06:37:00;about 3 seconds;A bright bluesh/green light heading quickly towards the ground. It was 6:38 in the morning and I was walking to the bus stop, and I saw a bright blueish/green ball of light moving towards the ground at an abnormally fast speed.   At first I thought it was a shooting star, but it was too big, and moving to quickly, and was colorful.   Then I thought it might be an airplane, but again it was moving too quickly, and towards the ground.  I only saw it for about 3 seconds, then it was blocked out by the roof of a house in my neighborhood.   I was in a sort of shock because I thought it was an airplane falling from the sky, but I heard no noise, and I haven't heard anything the news or internet about it.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
