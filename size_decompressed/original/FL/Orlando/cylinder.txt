Midday observation of cylinder type wingless craft with pointed top which flew horizontally.;1976-06-01 12:00:00;5-10 minutes;Midday observation of cylinder type wingless craft with pointed top which flew horizontally. I was approximately 12 years old, it was summer break.  I had been playing a ballgame with Barry F., Scott K., and Denny W.  It was lunch time and those three went to their respective houses to eat lunch.  I usually did not eat lunch so I waited in the open carport of Scott's house.  It was approximately noon, it has been a long time so I am estimating the approximately month, day, and year.  It was near the intersection of Showalter Court and Seabridge Drive in the Laurel Park Subdivision in Orlando, Florida.  Barry's house was on the southeast corner, Denny's house was on the northeast corner, and Scott's house was one house to the east of Barry's house.  I sat in the carport of Scott's house facing north.  I observed a white or silver in color craft which looked like a rocket sideways, a cylinder with a pointed top.  But the rocket looking craft was not flying upwards like a rocket launch, the craft was flying sideways in a counterclockwise motion from north to the west to the south very slowly.  The craft did not have wings.  I lived not too far from what is today the Orlando International Airport, but then it was not an International Airport.  And I had lived near McCoy Airforce Base before that house, so I had seen plenty of airplanes and jets.  When I saw the craft I immediately began yelling for the occupants inside Scott's house to come out.  I was even banging on the door. Finally, Scott's older sisters which were in high school came out.  But the craft had flown to the west out of sight.  I was very nervous trying to explain to them what I saw, but it was not there when they came out.  I then ran home as fast as I could.  I began explaining to my mom and grabbed her by the hand to come outside and look at the strange craft.  But two story apartments were built to the south of our home and the apartments blocked the view of the craft as it flew from the west to the south still in a circular counterclockwise motion.  I had not talked about the incident for almost 23 years when I had a great aunt on my maternal side come visit and have dinner.  During the night she mentioned about actual encounters with alien beings which included time loss, implantation of a device (which she states her doctor removed from her abdomen), and several follow up visits by aliens.  I had not said a thing to her when she confronted me about seeing an unidentified craft.  Her words I cannot recall totally were something to the effect of And you know because you have seen one haven't you?  I could only explain this confrontation as strange.  I never said a word to her about the incident.  I did not know a sight like this existed.  I am currently a field grade military officer in the Army Reserves.  I am also a sworn law enforcement officer working as a detective.  I cannot explain what I saw on that summer day, but it continues to be unexplained and unknown to me what the craft was that I observed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
fire cylinder over the Orlando International Airport...;2007-03-26 20:45:00;10 Minutes;fire cylinder over the Orlando International Airport... It was over the landing strip at the MCO airport.  We spotted the UFO hovering above a plane that was in the process of descending.  It was in the shape of a beer can, but it was made of fire.  The plane left our eyesight, but the object remained.  It casually floated off and we could still see it for about six minutes before it escaped our range of eyesight.  I recorded the sighting with my cellphone camera, but when we moved further down the road I checked the file I saved and it had erased on its own.  I never had a problem with my cell phone before when using the camera function.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
5 white cylinder shaped objects flying together at a consistant pace in Orlando, FL;2007-11-06 14:00:00;1 minute;5 white cylinder shaped objects flying together at a consistant pace in Orlando, FL My mother and I met up for lunch at a Wendy's restaurant. It was a clear day, blue skies, not a cloud in sight.  We were having lunch inside by the window when my mother said What are those? while looking up out the window.  I looked out the window as well, which casted no reflection and the view was clear. We both could see 5 unidentified objects in the sky. They were all WHITE in color, cylinder shaped, and appeared to be very high in the sky, and all traveling together at a consistant pace.  They definitely did not have any wings, visible lights, or appear to cast any reflection.  Had my cell phone had a camera, I am confident that I would have been able to capture them easily, as they were clearly visible to the naked eye.  They continued to move until they were no longer visible from where we were seated.  We agreed that they definitely weren't airplanes (nor do jetliners travel in packs), blimps (far too high, and again, blimps don't travel in packs), balloons (at least not balloon/round shaped ... and also far too high to be so visible, suggesting they were much larger), or anything else we could compare them to.  I'm still stumped by what they were, and am interested in finding out if other people have seen the same exact thing before.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
I saw a dark rectangular object with three bright lights hovering in the sky for about 5-10 minutes before it transformed and flew off;2011-10-16 06:30:00;15-20minutes;I saw a dark rectangular object with three bright lights hovering in the sky for about 5-10 minutes before it transformed and flew off I was walking my dog this morning at about 6:30 am when I looked out into the horizon and saw a dark rectangular object hovering in the sky with 3 bright lights on it.  Two lights were yellow, the other was red, and the light in the middle was rapidly pulsing.  At first I thought it was a plane, but then I noticed that it was not moving constantly like a plane does at night.  It was just there hovering in the sky. I looked closer to see if it was a tower with lights on it like an antannae but there was no tower attatched to the object.  At that point I was pretty certain it was a UFO.  I dashed back into my house, grabbed my camera, ran to a nearby neighborhood to get a better view, and began to film the object as it hovered there in the sky for about another 5-10 minutes.   After a while I noticed that the object was emanating a sound from it that sounded a lot like helicopter blades.  So I paused filming and began to look at the footage to see if was a helicopter.!   But when I looked back into the sky, the three lights had now transformed into an object with just one bright light, it flew higher into the sky, and then began to fly off. I filmed again for a few minutes as the object flew off.  There was no doubt in my mind at that point that what I saw was a UFO.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Orange glowing sphere in Orlando.;2013-11-03 05:30:00;3 minutes;Orange glowing spehere in Orlando I could not sleep and my blinds were opened.  I noticed an orange glow, similar to a street light.  I then realize that it was too high to be a street light.  The sphere was moving completely silent and glowing orange.  I was in the second floor of the house and saw the object at about 35 to 40 degrees in front of me moving toward the house (it was getting bigger).   I called my wife and son.  They also witness the sphere.  The sphere stopped and changed directions.  It was traveling aprox. 324 degrees NW (toward the house) and changed directions to  182 degrees south.  The height was about 100 feet of the ground.  The speed was much faster that what you see from a normal airplane or helicopter.    At no time I saw the sphere changed altitude.   There were no other colors or blinking lights. It was a constant orange glow.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Blue cylinder over east Orlando erratic flying/flashing inject.;2014-01-17 02:45:00;5 minutes;Blue cylinder over east Orlando erratic flying/flashing inject. Flying all sorts of directions, up down rapidly, back forth, very erratic flying pattern.  The shape would flash red the blue but parts of green as well.  Made sound like a small motorcycle engine.   Flew up down, maneuvers that an airplane nor helicopter could do.   Also, had a flying span larger than an R/C could cover.   Went above parking light and just hovered in a blue light.  Flashing blue light.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

The object appeared out of nowhere, & then seemed to just stop, hovering in the sky, at the moment I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, maybe for 5 seconds I was staring at this, when out of nowhere it seemed to just vanish…. Has anyone reported seeing this 7-4-16?  (This was around 3pm, & defiantly was not a fire work, the skies were blue, w/no clouds in the way of this sighting…);28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
