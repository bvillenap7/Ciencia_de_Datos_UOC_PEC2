There is an airport nearby, but it was too small for a plane.  Besides, planes don't hovor above trees, flash real bright, and then vanish.  That was the second occasion, and third UFO, I saw UFOs above the trees there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Large flashing light in the sky,directly over head that lasted at least 45 minutes.;2013-05-28 03:00:00;~45 minutes;Large flashing light in the sky,directly over head that lasted at least 45 minutes. At approx 0300 hrs on the morning of May 28, 2013, while at work, I received a phone call from a co-worker (we both work at a local theme park) urging me and my other co-worker to meet them at their location as he was witnessing a flashing light in the sky.   We packed up our tools and hurried over to their location.when we arrived there,both the co-worker who had called me and his co-worker were both staring straight up at the sky.  I then, along with my co-worker, looked up in the same area of the sky and witnessed a flashing light that appeared to be clouded in mist.   There were no clouds in the sky and we could see the moon and the stars.  The object appeared to be about the size of the moon at times, had an amber color to the flash and at times appeared to have a blue color as well.  The flash continued for approximately 45 mins getting progressively faint until it was no longer visible. I must note that there are large search lights stationed at the entrance to the theme park which remain on all night.At 1st we thought that perhaps the lights were illuminating something in the sky as they scanned that region (where the lights seemed to converge) but then we noticed that the flashing did not really follow the same timing as the search lights. At times the object appeared to be football shaped. It also appeared to me as if it were a beacon flashing in mist. Being that this object was directly above us,we ruled out any radio antennas. There was no other clearly definable shapes over head such as a blimp or helicopter.The object did not make any sound.We also pointed a laser pen at it's location.When we did this it appeared to move as the flash would emanate from a different location thatn before. In total there were 4 witnesses to this event. I did call a friend of mine who was in another location of the theme park and asked her to go outside and see if she could see it.She said that she only saw the flash once.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

Around 5:50 AM looking East saw an enourmous white flash which seemed to be traveling west and quickly disappearing leaving behind a huge boom-as if a lightning stike had hit right in the backyard.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Several unexplainable flying objects spotted over Orlando.;2014-11-15 23:45:00;30 seconds;Several unexplainable flying objects spotted over Orlando At 11:45 pm, I heard what I thought was thunder outside.  Then saw flashes of light through my windows.  I went outside and their was not a cloud in the sky and the temperature was around 60 degrees.  Then something that resembeled a large dragonfly, of a light green color flew past me.  It was practically invisible.  The night before at dusk I saw a yellowish, orangish round object flying parallel and just above the tops of the trees at high speeds, heading south.   Last month at 7:30 pm my daughter and I saw a very bright, white object hovering for 4 seconds and then flew away at very high speeds without a sound.  One week prior at 7:30 pm I saw a white, bright object in the sky moving very slow, then it turned red, then a flash of light and a illuminated cloud or smoke appeared in front of it and it disappeared.  Six years ago I went outside my house at 7:00 am and saw in the eastern sky 3 black bowling shapes in a triangle pattern hovering for about 10 seconds then flew away heading south at very high speeds without sound.   All of these occurances happened over Lake Jessimine, near Oakridge road and State Rd. 441.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Two white explosions in space witnessed in Orlando, looking south towards Saturn.;2016-06-17 11:50:00;One second;Two white explosions in space witnessed in Orlando, looking south towards Saturn. While looking to the south and observing saturn I saw two large white explosions in the vicinity of saturn.  The second explosion was about one minute after the first.It looked like stars exploding as they both flared bright for about a second and then collapsed to black.   I am assuming this was in space due to the quickness of the collapse of spent energy.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
