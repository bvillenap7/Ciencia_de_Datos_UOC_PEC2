Low flying object hovering w/ blue underbelly and eight bright lights oval in shape central Florida;2003-02-02 22:20:00;3 minutes;Low flying object hovering w/ blue underbelly and eight bright lights oval in shape central Florida I was heading from Orlando to Ft. Lauderdale and was traveling on Route 60 which connects the Florida turnpike to route 95. The connecting road is about 25 miles and was about 9 miles on route 60 towards route 95 when I noticed blinking lights up the road. Just thought they were lights on a pole but as I got closer, the lights were hovering over the other side of the road. The object was hovering about two or three times the height of a light pole and was about 3 or 4 times the size of my car. The object was oval, almost rectagular with curved corners. I only viewed it from the underside but it had an oval underbelly that glowed a dull teal blue and had two horizontal bands that also appeared blue but a bit darker. The bands on the underbelly appeared to structures within the oval underbelly. There were 8 bright lights that surrounded the blue convex underbelly. The 8 white lights were very bright and went on and off with a regular cycle and alternated with the blue underbelly light that went on and off alternately with the white lights. The white lights would be on then total blackness, then the blue underbelly oval light ( very dull ) then total darkeness then the white lights. It did move a bit to my left and at an angle as I approached. Unfortunately, I had just passed a slow moving vehicle and there was no breakdown lane and also a ditch on each side of the road, so I could not pull over to get a better look, without causing an accident with the car that I just passed, although, that car must have seen the object. There was just nowhere to pull over at that time. One last thing, I noticed a punjent slightly burning oder in my car after I passed it, very subtle.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
It was very big and had a lot of bright lights (white) with a small red light on top.;2003-03-17 22:50:00;10 minutes;It was very big and had a lot of bright lights (white) with a small red light on top. I was driving home when I saw something big and bright in the sky.  At first I thought it was blimp or something like that, but it seemed so big and was round, not the shape of a blimp.  I stopped my car and kept looking, it wasn't too far and it was moving slowly not too high above in the sky.  I was scared because I had never seen something like this so I headed home (I was approximately one minute away).  When I got home I told my boyfriend, he could tell that I was shocked because my eyes were watery but he didn't really seem to believe me.  He said let's go upstairs to see if you see it again.   I headed up before him and started looking towards the direction that I originally saw it (towards my left) and didn't see anything.  Then I looked towards my right and there it was.  My boyfriend saw it at that time and agreed with me that we've never seen nothing like this.  It was huge.  We then went outside to see if we can still see it and we still saw it but we had a better view from upstairs so we headed upstairs again and kept looking until it disappeared into some tress in the area.  If anyone in Orlando,Fl, Orange County, has seen it, particularly on the same date as I (03/17/2003), report it also.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

Silent, illuminated, quickly moving oval craft in early morning sky on an approximate south to north flight path;2006-04-11 06:50:00;Approximately 7 seconds;Silent, illuminated, quickly moving oval craft in early morning sky on an approximate south to north flight path At approximately 6:50 am, I was walking my dog, when I noticed an oval shaped craft crossing the sky at a fairly fast clip...heading was roughly South to North. The sky was clear and no other craft were in sight. It was completely silent. The oval was bright, but not as bright as Venus in the morning, and seemed to be self-illuminated. It was just slightly smaller than Venus, as well. I watched it for about 7 seconds, when it simply disappeared...gone from sight...no trail, no non-illuminated object still in the sky, no FAA lights...NOTHING. Again, the area of the sky where it was observed was clear...early morning blue all around.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Oval fast light traveling over Orlando International Airport in Florida;2007-04-14 23:48:00;35 seconds;Oval fast light traveling over Orlando International Airport in Florida The night of April 14th, 2007, around 11:48 pm, we were sitting in the balcony of our apartment located within a mile from the Orlando International Airport facing east. Watching the planes landing as usual, we located a medium bright light in the sky,  moving horizontal in a speed not usual for a plane. Looking thru the binoculars, I saw an oval light moving south on an unusual speed when all of the sudden it moved backwards (northwest) in a 90 degree angle and immediately continuing south in another 90 degree angle. The incident was no longer than 60 seconds.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Oval star, glowing very white and slightly pulsing, stayed stationary, then moved southeast in very unorthodox manner;2007-09-12 05:45:00;5 minutes;Oval star, glowing very white and slightly pulsing, stayed stationary, then moved southeast in very unorthodox manner I was walking my beagle in the early morning...it is still quite dark when we go out...watching the sky and stars as I always do. We walked to the corner of our street, and stopped so she could do some snootin' and investigatin', while I continued to scan my skies.  There are two stars in the east-southeast sky, at about 45 degrees above the horizon, that I find myself always looking at, and happened to be checking them out, when I noticed a third star next to them, on the south side. Looking more closely, I saw that it wasn't round, but oval in shape...more like a longer oval, but not cigar-shaped. And the quality of the light from it was different, being more of a glow as opposed to reflected light or light bulb type light. It was very white, with a blue tinge. It also slightly pulsed.  And that star just stayed there, not moving...and NOT like the way the headlights of a plane can seem to not move when coming directly towards you...it simply DID NOT move.  After a couple of minutes, it began to move very slowly towards the southeast, in what appeared to be a straight path. Suddenly, as I watched it, it went from being at a 45 degree angle in the sky, to about a 55-60 degree angle...and when it did this, the position of the craft did not change...no pointing upward or aiming...it was just suddenly up. From that angle, it continued southeast for a minute or so, then, as suddenly as it was up, it was back down at the 45 degree level, moving at the same steady rate of speed. I watched it until it was out of sight.  During its movement, the pulsing and color tone never changed, nor did the flight angle of the craft. Its size was approximately that of a BB pellet held at arm's length, slightly larger than the two stars I regularly see at that point in the sky.  I will send you a sketch of this event later today. Please feel free to contact me.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964
Object near DAWN space probe during launch from KSC;2007-09-27 07:35:00;Several seconds;Object near DAWN space probe during launch from KSC Regarding a report that was filed with NUFORC on 9/30/07 from the Kennedy Space Center... I saw that object near the DAWN space probe launch, too...a whitish color, bright but not like a reflected light, and shaped like an elongated oval. From my vantage point, it did not appear quite as bright as seen in the videos on YouTube. As for size...at about a 75 degree angle in the sky, it is hard to say, but was substantial enough to be seen clearly. It was clear enough that I commented to my neighbor across the street as to what the heck it could be, and how did it get so close to the rocket when there is very definitely a no fly zone in place during launches. We are quite fortunate living near KSC, and can watch launches from our driveway...and while I don't have the close proximity as someone closer to the Cape, the lift-offs are very clear. That object was only visible for a few seconds, but it was very definitely there. And it was travelling in a rough east to west direction.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

Amber/orange color light moved like sine wave over Orlando, FL;2011-10-17 20:58:00;10 seconds;Amber/orange color light moved like sine wave over Orlando, FL I live about 7 miles east of downtown Orlando, Florida.  I was outside on the phone, and I looked to the west and saw an amber or orange colored light that was oval shaped in the sky.  This object looked like it could have been as far away as downtown (7 miles).  It was definitely below the cloud ceiling, maybe 10,000 ft, best guess.  So I wasn't really that close to it. When I first saw this oval, amber light, I thought it could be a meteorite, but what it did next nullified that explanation. It was moving from south to north, left to right from my vantage, and it was moving up and down as well, much like a sine wave. The size was almost as large as a full moon. And the light was bright, but not shining.  It was just a steady orange glow. It didn't move unusually slow or fast, maybe a little faster than the speed of an aircraft. Then, it either shot due west, away from me really fast, or it slowly dimmed to a small point of light.  I believe it moved away, because it seemed to get lower in the sky.  The light disappeared, and a few seconds later reappeared as a dim light.  It did that twice, and that was the last I saw of it.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

Numerous bright, orange/red silent, glowing, pulsating oval objects traveling SE to NW for 5 to 10 min;2012-05-05 22:00:00;5 to 10 minutes;Numerous bright, orange/red silent, glowing, pulsating oval objects traveling SE to NW for 5 to 10 min We saw  as many as 12 (maybe more) orange/red glowing orb shaped objects climbing from the SE traveling to the NW in a line formation. There was about 500” separating them from each other.  We estimated that they were approximately 1,000’ to 1,500’ high. They appeared to have pulsating  orange/red  small “wings” as if on fire . They were totally silent and seemed to be traveling 30 to 50 MPH. There was very little if any surface wind at the time.  We discussed the possibility that they were balloons of some kind, but the lack of wind and the bright, pulsating  fire-like appearance didn’t fit a balloon behavior to us.  They were at times traveling close to the full moon and I was able to get some of them on video.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

Raspberry red oval craft observed traveling north to south along East Coast of Florida;2013-08-17 03:05:00;2 minutes;Raspberry red oval craft observed traveling north to south along East Coast of Florida At approximately 3:05 AM, Saturday, August 17, 2013, I went outside to get something out of our car.  As I got to the end of the driveway and looked across the street, due East, in the direction of the Space coast, I saw an oval object at about 30 degrees above the horizon.  It was traveling in what appeared to be a southerly direction along the coastal region. Thinking that I should get some kind of point of reference regarding size and such,  I held out my hand at arm's length. The UFO was gliding along very slowly, in a straight path, taking about 2 minutes to travel what measured at arm's length to be between 10 and 12 inches.  The size of the craft, using my thumbnail at arm's length, was about 1/2 an inch. And it was a medium to medium dark RASPBERRY RED...not the tone of red like on emergency vehicle lights, or on traditional aviation lights...and it pulsated slowly. The lighting of the craft seemed to come from within the object, and not from an external! light source.  It continued along its flight path at what appeared to be the same altitude and direction for the entire 2 minutes that I was able to see it.  When it was no longer visible, I came inside, marked this event on my calendar, told my husband that I just saw a UFO and that I had to report it to NUFORC.  I called your Hot Line, and have now made this written report.  Please feel free to contact me, if needed.;28.5259654888028;-81.3859872200964

While driving home at 10:20pm, traveling West on Conroy road, South of Orlando, Florida, we watched 15 oval lights move very quickly over us traveling in a Southwest direction where they all stopped over the Williamsberg area and hovered just above the low clouds that were about 500'.  Then after hovering for about 10 minutes, each one in turn traveled in an upward direction until the light could no longer be seen.  This was the most unusual night sky we've ever seen.

The craft suddenly stopped moving, and the flames ceased, leaving the craft almost invisible. As it proceeded to move, the flames started again. Out of shock, I was not able to record or take a picture. After about 30 seconds, the craft stopped moving, however the flames were not gone.
