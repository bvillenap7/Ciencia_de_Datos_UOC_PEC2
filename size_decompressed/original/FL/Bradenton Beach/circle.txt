Pulsing orange light disappears on vacation.;2013-08-18 21:45:00;5 minutes;Pulsing orange light disappears on vacation I am on a vacation with my family in Brandenton Beach on Anna Maria Island in Florida.  I was sitting outside with my sister listening to the sound of the waves, and suddenly an orange light appeared.  I knew it wasn't a plane because it didn't have blinking lights.  It was an orange circle that seemed to be pulsing.   We tried to take a photo but the condo owners have a screen over the balcony.  It dimmed slightly and just disappeared.  It never moved while we saw it.  It just seemed to hover.;27.48345;-82.7058
