Formations over Florida Lower Keys.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been observing celestial bodies.  PD));2007-11-09 19:45:00;Last 5 nights;Formations over Florida Lower Keys Every day for the last 5 nights we see 2 light patterns hover in the Eastern Direction in about 10,000 ft. and about 3-4 Miles apart. Individually each has flickering lights and they hover throughout the night in the same position but move rapidly left-right-up-down and sometimes in circular or semi-circular moves as they continue to hover in the same altitude. Usually couple of hours later 5-7 similar objects/light patterns appear more toward the West, the closest being straight above and the rest of them in some sort of formation stretching few miles apart. These are in much higher altitudes (our guess)50-70,000 ft or higher. These are very well visible once you have trained your eyes to pick each of them out. What is most obvious is that in the early morning at daybreak, the stars start to fade but these are still visible until the sun is almost up. Two days ago we observed a small light travel from Northern direction for about 2 minutes and judging from the altitude must have flown about 10 miles before being absorbed or joining the one parked above our house. The reason it is easy to pick them out is that the lights of all of them align in the same pattern no matter how far they are apart. There is a military base in Key West and we see the military planes fly but lot lower altitude also there are commercial flights. But much lower altitude 35,000 ft ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been observing celestial bodies, but that is only a guess.  PD));24.6648;-81.5167
