Gree Cigar moving ir odd direction;2004-10-13 00:00:00;20 second;Gree Cigar moving ir odd direction Earlier that day I biked to a freinds house and we hung out all day.... well 11:45pm rolled around and he offered me a place to sleep and i delcined and said i wanted to get home.  I biked down to the main road where there was a gas staion. i remeber watching the power lines and the shadows being cased across them. Well when I got to the gas station i checked my front tire to see if was running flat and then I looked up for some reason beyond me and saw what looked like dim green glow stick in the sky.... it must of been about 3,000 ft in the sky and it was about as thick as my thumb from my perspective. The ends of it were facing east/west but it traveled north.  I can remeber watching it for some where close to 20 second and then rushing over to the light of the gas station and filling up my front tire. I biked home and I kept looking over my back to see if I could see it again. What disturbed me most about it is I cant remeber how it dissappered and the fact that even with time for watching it, filling up my tire and slow travel..... i still have around 20 minutes of un explained time...
