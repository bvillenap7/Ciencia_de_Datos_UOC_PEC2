My desk is right next to my bedroom window. I saw from the corner of my eye a light coming up over the apt bldg next to mine. It was coming in my direction very slowly. It was just a solid white light. Not very high up  and making NO noise. There were no blinking lights. it was just a roundish white light. As slow as it was i was able to watch it for a good 5 minutes as it approached, I was *trying* to look past the light to see the body of the thing. I live not far from a small airport and a few tv stations with helecopters so im used to seeing/hearing planes and helecopters pretty often. So im relatively sure it wasnt anything like that. Especially since it had no blinking lights and made no noise that i could hear. Keeping mind that it was about 4:30 am and almost totally quiet outside. At the time i remarked to my online friends... whoa..ufo sort of joking, But as i watched it i got a bit more serious because i realized i really didnt know what the heck it was.

The light got brighter again and seemed to have color to it.  I turned my head and looked back at the sky to see that to the north and the same distance away and up there was a flare like streak in the sky and the light to the left dissappeared as if it went further West rapidly.  The flare like light to the right dissipated and had flashes of white light streaks flowing away from it until that completely dissappeared.  Then the original star like light that appeared first reappeared in the same area that we first saw it to only be blocked by some passing clouds.  The skys were clear enough to see Stars and planes.  Only a small patch of clouds obstructed our view in the end.;28.7593999999999;-81.3511999999997
