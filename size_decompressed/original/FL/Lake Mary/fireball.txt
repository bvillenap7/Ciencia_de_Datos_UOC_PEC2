Orange fireballs over central Florida;2012-01-27 21:50:00;10 minutes;Orange fireballs over central Florida While driving home my father and i spotted 3 floating fireballs in the sky, East,in a line formation.  After a minute they floated over the road in our neighborhood and formed in a triangular configuration then faded out of sight. 3 minutes later we spotted one about 1000 feet up going North.  It was a very bright orange fireball that moved slowly and disappeared.  A few minutes later we heard the sound of helicopter blades above our house.  The helicopter was heading East, following 2 distant orange fireballs that at that moment sped off out of sight.;28.7593999999999;-81.3511999999997
Starlight, Starbright…  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus and Jupiter?  PD));2015-06-30 23:30:00;~45 minutes;Starlight, Starbright... Two days before this incident occurred, my daughter told me that she had taken pictures of something strange she saw in the sky across the street from our home.   Two nights later when I went outside to grab my comb out of the car, I noticed an unnaturally bright star with a tiny little star at about 1 o'clock over & rather close to it on the right.  (Like if U have a piece of card board '7 you stick a regular sized hand held flash light through the middle & poke a pencil size whole at the 1 o'clock position about three inches above & to the right of it).  There was just something strange about the stars so I stood there for a minute or two longer.  Before I knew it, the very bright star dims down to the exact same size as the tiny star.   So I grab my phone out of my back pocket & begin record anything else that might occur.  Oddly enough though, I suddenly realize that I do not see what I expect 2 see through my camera but a whole different scene... Two large glowing amber-white lights which become three, accompanied but some smaller colorful light changing colors & going on & off.  The little light just keep appearing in different colors & flashing in like timed flashes.  Larger one pop up & appear & go off. The most interesting thing they did was kid of like diagonal bright light of three or four at a time carousel in motion (for lack of a better way to say it) in two or three of the different videos.  As I could not believe what I was witnessing, I turn in the direction that my daughter had taken her picture & noticed first two brightly lit light with three smaller white bluish lights underneath.  Before long I realized that there was a much larger light over the both of... None of which I could see without the use of my cell phone.  This was all invisible to my natural eye... I kid you not...  I felt totally hypnotized & overwhelmed by what I had just witnessed.  Knowing there was no logical way that I could explain what I had watched go on for the last 45 min..  I have at least seven decent videos & only one of the pictures my daughter took days before… ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus and Jupiter?
