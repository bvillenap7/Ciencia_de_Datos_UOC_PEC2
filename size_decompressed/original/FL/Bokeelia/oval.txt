During the trip I was casually observing the scenery, not really looking for anything. A twin-engined airplane appeared from the east, and I obseved it to try to determine its manufacturer. While observing the airplane another movement in the sky caught my attention. At first I did the proverbial doubletake. I witnessed two orb-like objects coming from the southwest, from what I could determine to be an extremely high altitude. They were flying in a single file formation, and I could not accurately determine the spacing as I was not certain of the altitude of the two objects. They continued on a northesterly course until they were just past the zenith, at which point they veered suddenly to the west and disappeared in a matter of seconds over the horizon in that direction. I am not a trained observer, but it was readily apparent they were traveleing at an incredible rate of speed. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the date of the event is March 15, 2002, but we will attempt to confirm that with the witness.  PD)) ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS: This to elaborate on my sighting,and to confirm the date (I read the posted report and saw the remarks). One thing I failed to mention was the absence of contrails. This didn't strike me as unusual at the time, but does now. Also the sudden change of course would have imposed bone crushing G-forces. I am no expert on aircraft, but do know enough about physics and the physiology of the human body to be certain that no human could have survived that manuever. ((END));26.6632;-82.1348
