Singularity are true! ((NUFORC Note:  One of several bizarre reports from same source.  PD));2005-03-09 23:45:00;20 seconds;Singularity are true! i was looking at the stars, through my telescope, when a saw a big spark, that i asumed was a supernova, i kept looking and from the spark came out a spacecraft sideways, and it was loosing control moving up and down for a few times,it was a bronce or cooper color but not brigth, then it stayed leveled and then when i was looking at this huge spacecreaft , it just dissapeared from my sight whit out doing anything. I Saw all this and since i was looking up, y only saw the bottom part of the creaft, it was oval elengated and the back part finished straight  line, the front part has three  small noses, now the front part has a big funnel type system and was narrowing to the center and then it will became another big funnel at the rear end. I did some calculations and the diameter for the ship was .5 miles, the explosion ocurred close to the reentry point, because i saw some let say solar reflections when the craft went up an down. It is like the enterprise a singularity point and a jump to another space. ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports from same source.  PD));26.6598;-80.2429000000001
