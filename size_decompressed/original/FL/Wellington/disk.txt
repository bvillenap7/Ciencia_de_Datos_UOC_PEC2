It was around 12:30 A.M or something around that and i had to go to the bathroom.  So i went outside to go.  I was on my way back into the tent when i heard a humming sound, so i looked up thinking it was just the helicopter that passes over my neighborhood at night.  I focused my vision because i couldn't really tell what it was and it was a really bright light that was shaped like a saucer. I called my friend out and so he came out and saw it and we both freaked because it was going really fast and it was flying lower than a helicopter would.  So i went back in the tent and posted a bulletin on myspace talking about the alien but only one person believed me.  So then we started to text each other.  I didn't hear back from her for like an hour or so and she texted me saying that she was looking out her window and that she saw the same exact thing that i described up in the first paragraph and it was heading in the same direction that i said so we both started freaking out about it but i eventually went to bed.  I'm going to be looking out for another one tonight and i'll try to take a picture of it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));26.6598;-80.2429000000001

Dark, extremely low and slow-flying, thick, disc-shaped UFO appeared over rooftop of neighbor's house.;2010-06-04 02:00:00;20 sec;Dark, extremely low and slow-flying, thick, disc-shaped UFO appeared over rooftop of neighbor's house. Sorry, word processor is not working. I was alone on an upstairs balcony smoking around 2am on a friday. I saw immediately above me (approximately 100 feet above and 150- 200 feet in front of me) a dark, very large, slow-flying (approx. 10mph), disc-shaped object (almost identical to the movie independence day), flying in a south-easterly direction.  It was making a low, humming (buzzing) noise as it passed over the house rooftop next to our house. In shock, my mouth dropped and I watched it literally become invisible as a wave of colorlessness enveloped it. I could still see the shape and outline of it, though, once invisible. Afraid I would miss the sighting's entirety, I did not alert my boyfriend who was inside only a few steps away. And since I'd seen other UFO's, but none sooooo low-flying, I did not want to miss a thing. I watched it melt away into the clouds at the same super-slow speed. The farthest I saw it's distance was approximately 500 feet away, still at approximately 100 feet up. I went inside and told him what I had just seen. Every night for a week we went out at the same time and watched for it's return. Unbelievably, the next Friday, exactly seven days later at the exact same time, the exact same thing happened, at the exact same place. The only difference was it was an additional 50-100 feet higher, at a total of 150-200ft up. I was facing it, with his back to it, and I said There it is! I pointed to it and he and I watched it do the very same thing I had seen only a week prior. We were stunned and I was only too happy to have had it verified by another pair of eyes. We watched for it and never saw it again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));26.6598;-80.2429000000001
