17+ Orange balls of light moving from the Southeast to Northwest.;2013-12-14 21:35:00;10-20 minutes;17+ Orange balls of light moving from the Southeast to Northwest We were going out to go walk the neighbor’s dog.  We exited the front door (which faces East) and observed 4 orange lights moving Northwest in what looked like a military finger four formation.   We observed these lights move away until they were out of sight then spotted two more coming from the same directing (Southeast) and moving Northwest along almost the same path of the other four.  We observed other groups ranging from 3-1 lights moving on a horizontal plane due Northwest for what was at least 15-20 minutes, I counted over 17 objects.  I am convinced each light was its own individual object because their speeds varied. I am a military enthusiast, love space, and have grown up around aircraft my whole life.

Circular, very strong white light.;2014-01-19 18:36:00;4 minutes;Circular, very strong white light. They were seen hovering over a house at sundown and flying very high with one very bright light then going up and down.  I don't think this was a toy.  A toy doesn't have such a bright light and fly too high. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the time above, to reflect an evening sighting.  PD));26.6598;-80.2429000000001
Strange blue light seen over Forest Hill Blvd. in Wellington, Florida.;2014-03-03 19:30:00;2 minutes;Strange blue light seen over Forest Hill Blvd. in Wellington, Florida I was traveling west in my vehicle on Forest Hill Blvd. near the Wellington Green mall, when I spotted a single blue light in the sky to the west of me.  The light hovered at times, but also appeared to travel, changing directions at random. As I got closer to the light, I rolled down my window so that I could get a better look at it.  I could make out no details other than the fact there was a blue light maneuvering above the road.  Eventually, I passed under it and as far as I could tell, the light was around 50 feet directly over the road. Traffic was heavy in the area so I couldn't take my eyes off the road for too long.  It seems likely that other people saw it, too. I think the most logical explanation for what I saw is a remote-controlled hobbyist's aircraft such as a helicopter or quad-copter.  Due to traffic noise, I couldn't make out the sound of a motor, but the perceived altitude and way that the light moved made me think of an R/C craft.  Still, I can't say for sure what I saw.;26.6598;-80.2429000000001

Stationary red light which emitted a bright flash after 10 min. high above the sky and changed colors.  ((NUFORC Note:  Arcturus?  PD));2018-03-20 22:30:00;12 minutes;A stationary red light which emitted a bright flash after 10 minutes high above the sky and changed colors.   On March 20, 2018, at 10:15pm, in Wellington, Florida, I was walking my dog in the neighborhood.  As I looked up at the star filled sky toward the east, I noticed a red light sitting in one place almost straight up (1:00 o’clock setting). I watched the object for 10 minutes with no movement what so ever as planes flew high overhead and low overhead not far from Palm Beach International airport.  This object was miles high and pulsing a red light every other second.  Suddenly two red beams came out of the object east and west some hundred yards from the object but they traveled equidistant from the centered object and stopped. Then the light pulsed blue and the object moved over to the east a bit further, hovered for another 3 or 4 minutes and then just disappeared.  No weather balloon does that type of movement nor does it send out a microburst of light side to side that stops.  A helicopter cannot go that high, ever!  There was no sound.;26.6598;-80.2429000000001
