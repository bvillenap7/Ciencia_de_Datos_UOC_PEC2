Triangular orbs move in sky.;2014-09-14 20:00:00;1 minute;Triangular orbs move in sky. My seven year old daughter and I were on our balcony of our second story home.  We both saw three lights that we assumed were stars in the sky.  They were in a triangular formation.  I thought what I saw was because my eyes were tired until my daughter clarified my experience.  We both saw the lights move as if they were swirling.   They disappeared and then reappeared in a different place in the sky.   We both were intimidated so we quickly went inside and locked the door.
