A black cheveron with circling lights about a hundred yards long.;2007-11-22 12:45:00;1 minute;A black cheveron with circling lights about a hundred yards long. Sitting outside on Thanksgiving Day, I looked up at the sky and saw a small fluctuation in the hue/color of the sky. At first I just discarded it as my eyes making things up, but then a couple of seconds later I saw it again farther south. Then, a black shape appeared in the sky. It was probably about 2,000 feet high and maybe 100 yards long. It had a series of lights that would circle around it in a pattern. They were all white. About a minute after I saw the first change in the sky, it disappeared and did not come back.;26.6598;-80.2429000000001
