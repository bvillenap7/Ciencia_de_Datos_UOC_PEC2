Orange-yellow light surrounding a craft hovering.;2015-07-04 20:00:00;10 minutes;Orange-yellow light surrounding a craft hovering. I went outside to watch the fireworks, at the moment I thought is was a slow burning orange-yellow mortar descending over the Polo field near where the fireworks were going off, but then after about 3 mins it started slowly rising, so I thought it may be a low hovering helicopter or a drone, but the light was bright and covering it's whole body.   Then the light faded and a dark shape came in to view and slowly went up and down and faded out behind the clouds.;26.6598;-80.2429000000001
