30 UFOs.;2013-12-29 19:30:00;5-10 minutes;30 UFOs. We watched as one craft was heading from West to East and my wife remarked that it was a low flying plane to which I stated it was not due to the solid color of orange which were flashing reddish to orange to whitish.   As we watched it as I have seen in the past here yet never reported that they just disappear as this one did.   After we watched it disappear I noticed from the west 4 more objects travelling at about 1200-1500 feet high and were not flying in particular formation.  I noticed some were faster than others and all were travelling faster than the clouds which were moving in the same direction however these were moving twice the speed if not faster than the wind.  This continued until about 30 had passed.   Due to the height these were I would estimate the crafts at around 10-12 feet in circumference.  The brightness if these were Chinese lanterns would be at about 1000 candles at least.   After a certain amount of time of watching them they all headed to the same place out East and would disappear.;26.6598;-80.2429000000001
