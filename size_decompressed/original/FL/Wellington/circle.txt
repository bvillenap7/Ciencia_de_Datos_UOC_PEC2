UFO Sighting Wellington, Florida 11/29/2010;2010-11-29 18:00:00;Not sure;UFO Sighting Wellington, Florida 11/29/2010 I was on my way to class, and I was running late. I've never seen a UFO but I've read about the recent sightings. What I saw was not a plane, I was driving west towards wellington, it was just getting dark outside. The time was 6:00 p.m. I saw a plane go by since the airport is only 8 miles away from where I was currently at. Then I noticed what I thought was a plane at first, but it was too low to be a plane. I only saw it move once and it moved up a little higher and moved back down to its original spot and just stayed there, I drove a little closer and it was not a light from a tower. It glowed a very bright white color, looked like a star. It was so bright that after looking at it for awhile it looked liked it formed a star and would go back to a smaller size taking form of a circle. I've never seen anything like this, I tried to take a pic its kind of fuzzy since I took it at a stop light. I was alone in my car so I dont know if the other cars witnessed! it. I am the type of person that pays attention to every little detail and I just happend to notice this light since it was so close to the surface. I'm the type of person that doesnt believe it till I see it, and I definately saw something that stumped me. I've looked up videos and pictures of weather balloons too see if thats what it might be and this looked nothing like a weather balloon.;26.6598;-80.2429000000001

Witnessed a circ. light travel S past moon, faster than an a/c, pause for a few min., turn around and head N.  ((anonymous report));2017-03-15 06:00:00;15;Witnessed a circular light travel south past moon, slightly faster than an airplane, pause for a few minutes, turn around and head north past the moon again, l ran inside and brought my wife outside to witness it, so it did not seem like l was seeing things.   The object again stopped and did not move again for the remainder of the time l was outside.   Just before going back inside l saw another one farther away traveling north east a short distance from where the first one stopped.   The sky was exceptionally clear without any clouds.   There were also commercial planes flying, and l could distinctly tell the difference as well as the objects were a great distance farther in the sky in comparison to the planes.   I'm in my late 40's and this is my first sighting.  I was skeptical about UFO's until today.  l'm a believer now.
