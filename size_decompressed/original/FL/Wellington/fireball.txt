fireball-like sphere flickering in north-western sky;2005-02-28 23:30:00;10 minutes;fireball-like sphere flickering in north-western sky I was driving north on Forest Hill Blvd coming home from ym girlfriend's house about 11:20pm on 2-28-05. I was looking to the left of my vehicle and in the distance I saw a wierd light in the sky. Planes fly overhead in this area often as I'm close to a major airport, so I didn't think much of it, except planes are ussually white lights, and this was more orange, like an open flame. It also flickered slightly and had a slight haze around it. From my standpoint in my vehicle, it looked spherical in shape. I was watching it on and off while driving down the road as trees obscured my view every few seconds, but seemed to stay in the same position in the the horizon, so either it was stationary or it was moving directly perpendicular to me, like when a plane is coming right at you and it seems not to move. Then about 11:28, it just vanished. I searched the sky,but saw nothing but darkness and clouds. It didnt seem to have gone behind the clouds. More like if somone had hit a switch and turned it off suddenly. it looked very similar to something I saw back in 1998 or 99, when I saw a fireball coming down as if a meteor, but then leveled out its descent and cruised paralell to the ground for at least 30 minutes.;26.6598;-80.2429000000001
Red pulsating orb appears i drive under it and it goes out.;2012-01-01 01:05:00;20;Red pulsating orb appears i drive under it and it goes out. I was driving my car to get some gas a friend of mine was in the car with me and said look up do you see that and i said what and finally we park and I am sitting there looking at this red orb floating in the sky.  There was a red haze around it or aura look to it and it just pulsated.  However I am trying to reject the thought of what I am seeing so I closely studying the object noticing its moving in strange patterns that a balloon a known spacecraft cannot move and it was not far away it was very close down i want to say 16 to 18 stories from the ground and it radiated a red glow until it went dim then dimmer and gone and re appeared and slowly dimmed out again.

2 circular balls of red light floating over neighborhood in wellington, fl;2012-10-12 20:30:00;10 minutes;2 circular balls of red light floating over neighborhood in wellington, fl Around 8:30 pm there was a strange red glowing circular light in the sky that floated overhead heading south. Two minutes or so later another glowing red ball of light floated directly above our heads but a little lower than the first, following the same path heading south.   We watched until they were both too far to see anymore but none of us could explain what we saw because it made no noise, left no trail, and moved at a steady pace. ((NUFORC Note:  Flaw in date of sighting.  We assume a sighting in 2012.  PD));26.6598;-80.2429000000001
Me and my friends saw a giant orange fireball going really fast across the sky.;2014-02-02 00:00:00;45 seconds;Me and my friends saw a giant orange fireball going really fast across the sky. I was at a restaurant and everyone noticed a giant dark orange fireball in the sky.  It was going really slow at first but then sped up extremely fast.  It was headed northeast.  It was not making any sound and was to big to be a plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));26.6598;-80.2429000000001
