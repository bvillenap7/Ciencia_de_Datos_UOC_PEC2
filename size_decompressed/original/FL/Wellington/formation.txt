Orange Lights - 13 in formation over Lake Wellington;2011-12-31 23:30:00;10 min;Orange Lights - 13 in formation over Lake Wellington At approximately 11:30 pm on New Year's Eve night, my husband and I were sitting in our back yard, on the dock facing West, overlooking Lake Wellington.  Suddenly over the horizen in the western sky, appreared a bright orange light, followed by another and another.  We counted 13 in all, flying in formation toward the north.  All 13 lights were evenly spaced, same size, same color following each other.  We watched until they disapeared from view.  There was no noise, it was very silent out.  I tried to capture it on my video cell phone, but when I checked out the video, you can't see the orange lights.  You can see the moon and the reflection of the moon on the water, and the lights from the houses across the lake, but where we saw the orange lights, the sky looks pitch black.  The video didn't capture the lights.  We didn't call anyone, we were just dumbfounded.  I'll try to send a drawing of what it looked liked and a picture of our back yard to get an ide! a.;26.6598;-80.2429000000001
