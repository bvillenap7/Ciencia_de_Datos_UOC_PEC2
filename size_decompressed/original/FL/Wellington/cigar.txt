Cigar shaped light in southern sky of Wellington.;2014-06-02 21:00:00;30 seconds;Cigar shaped light in southern sky of Wellington Was getting ready to view the International space station @ 9:02 pm.  Took out my phone to use compass app.  To get bearings of which ISS is going to fly overhead.   My friend was outside getting ready to see if we could see anything, cause it was a bit cloudy.   I went outside to backyard to point out direction the station should fly by.  Looking at a SSW direction, we saw this light fly diagonally 8 o'clock to 1o'clock  stopped as if it was detected then flew the same way downward.   That was the end of sighting!;26.6598;-80.2429000000001
