White light seen similar to the description of that seen in Iran.;2004-04-30 23:00:00;5 seconds;White light seen similar to the description of that seen in Iran. Overcast night with no lighting or rain.  Walking down road to mailbox heading East. White glowing orb appeared moving gracefully and horizonally across the sky from south to north at fairly high speed, but not as fast as a meteor.  Light stayed constant, and did not appear to be a strobe light.  Curved down rapidly at about 30 degress toward land and then dissappeared from my sight.  Appeared as white as Jupiter appears in sky however may have been 20 times the size.  Looked similar to a large comet moving across the sky without a tail.  Very white light.;28.9223;-82.39
