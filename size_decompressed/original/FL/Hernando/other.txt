THREE VERTICAL CIRCLES WITH TRIANGLE SEEN;2008-04-24 22:00:00;AT LEAST 5 MINUTES;THREE VERTICAL CIRCLES WITH TRIANGLE SEEN THERE SEEMED TO BE 1 THAT HAD 3 CIRCLES VERTICAL AND THEN OFF TO THE SIDE WAS A PERFECT APPEARING TRIANGLE. THE TRIANGLE NEVER MOVED, THE CIRCLE THING MOVED VERY FAST LEFT AND RIGHT AND UP AND DOWN AND WAS VERTICAL. AT TIMES IT WOULD CHANGE THE COLOR OF ONE OF THE CIRCLES. THIS SEEMED TO BE NEAR TAMPA AS FAR AS WE COULD TELL. THEN AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES THE BOTTOM LIGHT OF THE TRIANGLE DISAPEARED AND THEN THE WHOLE TRIANDLE WAS JUST GONE, LIKE LIGHTS OUT GONE. THEN THE CIRCLE THING JUST APPEARED TO BE A VERY BRIGHT STAR.;28.9223;-82.39
