About 200'-300' away from us.   As I took a second look I shouted to my daughter and mother to look out my side of car windows as I made the right turn from a stop sing.   They confirmed what I was seeing, as we drove slowly this huge light object seemed to vanish SSE slowly below the tree line which were about 30'-40' tall pine trees and a 1/4 mile away.  This was a cool, clear day in S.West Central Florida. ((NUFORC Note:  Flaw in original date indicated.  We have requested a correction.  PD));28.9223;-82.39
