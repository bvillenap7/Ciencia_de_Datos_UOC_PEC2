Pale dim white and blue lights.;2016-07-04 21:00:00;30 minutes;Pale dim white and blue lights. Watching the community fire works in Davenport, Florida, I notice a Pale white circular light. My first thought was a spot light until I noticed it moving in irregular patters.  my second thought was a swarm of bugs... then the lady next to me pointed it out too. There was maybe 150 people at the event.  Not sure how many people noticed.  Then 2 low flying planes from either direction swoop in.  I live close to the airport, but I never seen planes fly this low.  Right as the planes pass each other and circle back around, the pale white circular light speeds away, almost directly up, faster than anything I have ever seen.  They hung around for about 30-40 minutes.  the sky was hazy and cloudy due to storms moving out.  it looked like the lights were shining through the clouds.... THEN... driving the gulf cart in the back of the neighborhood where they are still developing it, my son notices a pale blue flashing beam in the sky... going horizontally. with more pale whi! te circular lights floating around it, much higher in altitude this time.  My son got scared so we headed back home.;28.2092114130438;-81.6139625000001

The object seemed to be able to move at varying speeds and very erratically.  Ran upstairs to get my roommate and when I returned it was gone.  My friend that was downstairs watching it said it flew back the direction it came from and disappeared.   Wondering if anyone else spotted this object.

Slow fireball with no tail floating over Central Florida sky.;2016-11-26 22:00:00;4 minutes;Slow fireball with no tail floating over Central Florida sky. Around 10:00 PM my friend was leaving my house when he saw a bright object floating in the sky.  He yelled for me and I walked outside to see a round object that seemed to be on fire.  The object made no sound.  It had no tail.  It didnâ€™t seem to be very far up in the sky but somewhat far.  It looked like it was floating across the sky at a medium speed.  It was going in a straight line towards the west.  We watched it until it disappeared behind houses out of our view.   About 10 minutes after seeing the first object, we were watching the sky still and saw another one that looked the same and was traveling at the same speed.  The second one was farther from where we saw the first one.  It was traveling in the same direction however.  We waiting outside for 20 minutes and saw nothing more.;28.2092114130438;-81.6139625000001
Red circle object hovered moved 200 feet South then back to location and descended with no sound;2017-03-25 23:20:00;~7 seconds;Red circle object hovered moved 200 feet South then back to location and descended with no sound Noticed a red circle less than a 1/4 mile North of my location.  The circle was a steady red color it never blinked.  It was above a large tree the tree is about 100 feet in height.   Object appeared stationary for about 2 seconds and moved to the south in a very smooth and controlled fashion.  It passed behind a large palm tree for maybe a second.  It stopped just the other side of that tree for again maybe a second.  It then reversed course an moved back the way it came from.  When it returned to the point of origin it stopped and slowly descended downward. The weather was clear visibility was 10 miles the ceiling was 2045 feet wind was about 10 miles per hour blowing from the ESE direction.  From what I observed, I suspect that what I saw was an RC or Helicopter or a quad copter, as am familiar with these and there are several vacation condo's and villa's in my area. The object was below the standards for hobby type RC craft below 400 feet and not near any major Airports.  The object appeared to land and made no noise no other aircraft around at that time.  Nothing out of the ordinary occurred while it was observed.;28.2092114130438;-81.6139625000001
