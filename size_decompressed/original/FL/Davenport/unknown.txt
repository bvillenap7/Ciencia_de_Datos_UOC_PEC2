Power outage and blinking lights in Polk County Florida.;2006-11-26 22:30:00;15 mins;Power outage and blinking lights in Polk County Florida. While sitting at home and just finishing watching a movie me and my wife were on the couch.  Although we don't know if this is related there was a flash of white light either outside or from a lamp bulb.  It was to quick to tell. the power went out in the neighborhood right after for about 10 seconds and then came back on. As we sat there and talked about it I rememered I needed something at the store and on my way out to the car I saw a spotlight searching over houses.  I was pretty sure this was a power truck looking for a blown box but I don't think they saw any because they drove off a minute later.  I then looked into the sky to see the little dipper and a few other stars. I aways see one or 2 stars that look like they're gleaming but I noticed one tonight that was not gleaming but was actually blinking.  Sometimes I know the gases in the air can make star look another color but this one was literally blinking red, green and blue.  I called my wife out who is very closeminded to these things but admitted 'that's not a plane.  Now I know planes move at high altitudes and sometimes apear not to be moving but they wouldn't be using those light schemes especially that high. The light stayed stationary for about 5 minutes as we watched but as soon as my wife went in to get the camera it moved up and to the right. I took about 6 pictures at 5 mega pixels and large format but it was pretty dark in the sky so the pics do show the color and in a few it looks as though the object is 2 pieces but you can't make out a shape. I don't know much about image construction so all i can really do is increase the size to see the colors but I can't figure out a shape. Here are some links to the cropped pics. http://img242.imageshack.us/img242/3725/p1010595bo5.jpg  http://img165.imageshack.us/img165/6732/p1010596ve6.jpg  http://img242.imageshack.us/img242/5838/p1010598hx4.jpg  http://img242.imageshack.us/img242/9093/p1010599gs8.jpg   Either way like I said I have seen alot of strange lights  WAIT AS I'M SITTING HERE NOW EXACTLY ONE HOUR LATER WE JUST GOT ANOTHER FLASH AND POWER OUTAGE. THE LIGHT IS BACK IN THE SKY. Please look at the pics and if you're in the polk county area of florida share your sightings too. Im going back outside.;28.2092114130438;-81.6139625000001
