Light traveling in an arc, at high altitude.;2007-01-17 20:00:00;3 to 5 seconds;Light traveling in an arc, at high altitude. We were visiting with neighbors while walking our dog.  One of the neighbors happens to catch something out of the corner of his eye, and says: Look at that! and I turned to look. I had time to turn and see it for about a good 2 seconds. We all witnessed a large, (about the size of a quarter to your naked eye at arms length) orange light traveling in an arc (with the shape of the earth, or atmosphere) The reason I say it was large is that it appeared to be at a very high altitude. It traveled slowly for the few short seconds we saw it.  It crossed the sky on a heading or west to north west, and then simply vanished.  Our first thought was that this was a piece of space junk re-entering the atmosphere. I have no idea what it was, but it was moving a lot slower than a shooting star would move.  I've seen Russian Rocket bodies enter the atmosphere, and generally they tend to disintegrate and you can see different parts, or a shower of sparks as they fall. My other thought was that it had something to do with a Chinese Anti Sattelite weapon test, and could have been debris from that.  Again, it didnt splinter or spark. It was just solid. This was really odd.  We have no idea what it was.;28.2092114130438;-81.6139625000001
Pulse Plasma light / craft  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a flare from an Iridium satellite.  PD));2007-03-20 06:15:00;30 seconds;Pulse Plasma light / craft As I was walking my dog just a few minutes ago I was looking up at the stars and saw, what I thought was a satellite.  It was about the same magnitude of an ordinary star, and sometimes you’ll see a satellite in the morning or at night when the sun from over the horizon hits them just right.  For reference it was moving slightly faster than the satellites I’ve seen in the past. That would mean it was either moving faster than a satellite, or at a similar speed, but lower altitude.  It was moving on an almost perfect easterly heading, if anything a little east to northeast. It did not appear to maneuver or change directions.  As I watched it arc across the sky all of a sudden it was surrounded by a brilliant flash.  That’s when I knew it wasn’t an ordinary satellite I was seeing it was something else.  The flash was not like a strobe light of an airplane, but more like a cloud of plasma that enveloped the light.  Relative to the size of the light I saw moving, the flash appeared to be about 10 times its size.  Then it flashed again about every 5 to 7 seconds.  I watched it until it was out of sight, but then I saw another flash even though I couldn’t see the light itself.  Whatever it was, it just kept on going.  While technically a UFO, I’m beginning to think I might have seen a high altitude spy aircraft, or black aircraft.  The flash could have been a pulse detonation type of propulsion system, or atmospheric skip vehicle.  If it was emitting a pulse, or skipping the atmosphere at the altitude I think it was, its exhaust, or the interaction with the atmosphere might have created the flash / plasma effect I was seeing.  The color of the light / vehicle, and the flash were identical, both appearing a brilliant white, similar to a white LED light in color temperature.  There were no other colors or lights that one might normally associate with an aircraft.  Other than the light / flash I could not distinguish the planform of an aircraft or any structure. Again, it was dark, moving fairly fast and at high altitude.  Here comes the strange part.  As I watched the light arc across the sky, all of a sudden I see a shooting star or something cross its path immediately behind it.  Whatever that was, it was a very very quick streak of light, but in an amber color.  The streak was moving on a line I would estimate to be north to northwest in direction. So I’m thinking did something just shoot at this thing? Or was this a total coincidence.  Very odd, hopefully someone else saw this too.  (I was a trained aircraft observer for the Western Michigan University flight team in the early 1990’s.  During the flight competitions we had an aircraft recognition tests so I was trained to visually identify a wide variety of commercial and military aircraft.)

Bright cobalt blue light on a north-east path from Davenport, FL. @ 5:45 AM.;2015-07-11 05:45:00;5 minutes;Bright cobalt blue light on a north-east path from Davenport, FL. @ 5:45 AM My dogs became very alert and anxious to a muffled booming noise (similar to a door being slammed in the distance).   When I peaked out of the window there was a cobalt blue light in the sky which seem to have movement.  Thinking it was a reflection from an electronic device in my bedroom, I decided to go outside to confirm if it was in fact a light in the sky.  To my surprise, it was.  The cobalt blue light continued on a path to the North East from my location before disappearing in the distance a rapid lateral motion could be seen which made it seem impossible for a civilian plane.  The light was a solid, non-flashing cobalt blue light.   I have been a plane spotter and photographer for years, and have seen many civilian and military aircraft fl,y and it did not behave as such.  Living in an area with many balloon flights which often have a light of similar color, I discarded the option due to its speed and path.  Also discarded it being a rotary wing craft, due to its speed and rapid lateral movement.;28.2092114130438;-81.6139625000001
My girl friend and I were outside having a cigarette, happened to look up and noticed a couple pulsating lights from yellow to blue.;2017-08-12 03:00:00;Several hours;My girl friend and I were outside having a cigarette, happened to look up and noticed a couple pulsating lights from yellow to blue and green.  At first, we thought they were planes, but had noticed they did not move but there was 3 of them in a triangle formation.  Then had noticed there was more spread sporadically around.  Then that's when we noticed a large light in front of the triangle formation appear for several seconds and move at rapid speed before disappearing.   We went inside for awhile, then decided to go back out, and they were still there, except for there was now a solid yellow light looking like a huge yellow ball to the left of the formation.  At first was huge then faded to nothing in a instant, then it instantly came back.  Once again we went back inside for awhile came back out and the 9 original lights that were positioned in there places were still in exact same spots still pulsating colors every now and then.   This happened between hours of 3am and 6am.;28.2092114130438;-81.6139625000001
Orangey-yellow light that flew higher up to the sky, dimmed out then disappeared, then appeared again in the same position.;2017-12-31 20:30:00;3 minutes;Orangey-yellow light that flew higher up to the sky, dimmed out then disappeared, then appeared again in the same position. Around 8:30 pm my cousin and I went outside of our house to wait for a friend that was supposed to be pulling up.  My cousin was holding onto a balloon filled with helium and she ended up letting go, so we both looked to the sky to watch it float away.  While we were looking to the sky, west of where we were standing, we both saw a very bright orangey-yellow light flying upwards from behind a couple of trees.  It wasn't very close, it seemed to be a few neighborhoods over, and we were just watching it fly up.  An airplane was flying at the time and I am very familiar with airplane lights, so when my cousin assumed it was an airplane, I assured her that it was not.  It was extremely bright and sort of round, so it could not have been an airplane.  I only saw one, and in order to rationalize it, I thought that it could have been a paper lantern someone had lit and released into the air, that's how bright it was.  However, it started getting higher in the sky and closer! to where my cousin and I were standing.  If it was a paper lantern, in a couple of minutes it should have caught fire and burned up.  The light started dimming and that's what I assumed it was doing under the paper-lantern theory, and then it disappeared.  We were still out there waiting for the friend, and after the 3 minutes it spent in the sky, I noticed it started glowing again after disappearing.  It regenerated in the same position in the sky that it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));28.2092114130438;-81.6139625000001
