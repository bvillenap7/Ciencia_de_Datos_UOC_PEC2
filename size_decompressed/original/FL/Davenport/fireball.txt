I have pictures I can send.  This is not the first time I have seen activity in this area but the first time I have seen it in daylight.;28.2092114130438;-81.6139625000001
Several orange fireballs over Davenport, Florida.;2013-11-01 00:28:00;10 minutes;Several orange fireballs over Davenport, Florida. I was outside looking for my dog who ran off earlier.  I noticed several(at least20) fireball like lights descending from the sky.  At first I thought they were stars. But they were orange and moving.  They all moved in formation. They were like a flock of birds. I watched until they all went below my fence line.  But then 3 of them ascended and got smaller until they disappeared. Then 1 more did the same.  And 1 at a time, they all did the same.   I got a little on my camera.   I have never seen anything like this before.;28.2092114130438;-81.6139625000001
