I was heading east-bound on Florida State Road 40, approximatly 4 miles east of Silver Springs, Florida.  SR. 40 has a bridge that traverses over the Ocklawaha River in Marion County.  To the right, before the bridge, there is a small boat basin, complete with park benches where families can pull in and spend a day on the river.  This boat basin is directly to the right when you start to go up the bridge. There are very tall (approximatly 30 feet high) Pine/Oak trees all around the road and boat basin here. About 500 yards before the start of the bridge/boat basin, I saw something pass no more than 3 or 4 feet over the trees in that area. The object was solid black, darker than the night sky, and had red circular lights underneath it. I slowed down my vehicle drasticaly, rolled down my window and turned off my sterio to listen for either hellicopter blades or plane engines. There was TOTAL silence. As soon as the object had disappeared from the visible area above the trees, a Search or Spot light came on in the middle of the highway, and began to search up and down the road for something. I was about 200 yards from where the spot light was, and in curiosity I turned on my bright lights to see if I could also view what they were looking for.   As soon as my brights were visible to whatever the craft was The spot light disappeared.  I slowed down to about 15 miles per hour, and looked everywhere in the sky, and in the trees to see if I could view whatever this craft was.  It wasnt there.  It had totaly vanished.;29.249925;-81.9901
1 red light  with many white lights caused vision to be distorted over silver springs florida;2008-02-05 20:05:00;1 min;1 red light  with many white lights caused vision to be distorted over silver springs florida We were outside and looked up and both saw this bright red light flash in the sky. We continued to watch this and saw red and white lights flashing in no patterned way. The red light was in the middle and was the brightest. The white lights flashed to the sides. The lights went from side to side horizontally and were not in sequence. At some times the lights were brighter than others. The lights messed with our vision. It sometimes looked like the object was 3d and then looked like it was flat. We were looking up at about a 30 to 45 degree angle. The object dropped quickly out of out sight behind a 2 story building. We both stepped backwards to see if we could see it again and noticed it right above the building at about a 10 to 15 degree angle. It stayed there for 15-20 seconds then the object looked like it was going away from us very fast and straight up not out. The only light that was visible was the bright red one. After about 2 seconds it was gone and has not returned. The sighting lasted about 1 min.;29.249925;-81.9901
Friendly lights in the sky.;2012-02-01 15:00:00;Still active;Friendly lights in the sky I see them as if they where stars,  They are very active and seem to want us to know that they exist. The stars move in the sky,  They can create sounds, and very elegent displays.  And thats it its hard to see them until it is night time and I cant be sure for a fact if what I am seeing is a sighting but it should definitely be looked into.;29.249925;-81.9901
