Several ufos in different shapes fly low over neighborhood in tavares, Fl.;2008-06-22 21:00:00;1hr-2hr;Several ufos in different shapes fly low over neighborhood in tavares, Fl. Me and my boyfriend we’re sitting in our Jacuzzi in Tavares fl, when we saw something fly extremely low over us that was shaped like a triangle and its flying very smooth low and fast as we watched where it went  we quickly saw more of them. We are right on a golf course and on the other side is a separate neighborhood which we saw all of them almost scan. it was very bizarre then we saw more object that were fireball shaped and moved faster than anything vie ever seen they changed colors from red to yellow and even blue but there was no pattern to these lights. There was eventually over ten of them and they all went to the same area even know they came from all directions they started to disappear but one remained there was a large white fireball shaped one that hover for over an hour we went back to see if it was still there and it was in a different location then another one appeared and they were gone.  There is usually not much if any air traffic being that we live in a very country area. I used to live by an airport though in Orlando fl and I’ve never seen any lights like these or anything that shot up and down and at angles in the sky so quickly. i'm still in shock ive seen some ufos before but this was so close and im 100% positive they were not regular air crafts. just to add it was almost as if they hovered over theses houses like they were scanning the neighborhood. it also seemed as if we saw what looked like a jet fly towards the objects;28.801;-81.734
