My wife and I were driving west on state road 46 just north of Rock Springs Run state preserve.  When off in the distance towards the west between a few dark clouds I noticed a bright orange glowing fireball.  We watched the the fireball for about a minute and I noticed small little orange sparks flying off the back but there was no trail or vapor trail or anything following behind the glowing object.  Also it seemed that the fireball wasnt growing in size nor was it getting smaller.  As we continued west I pulled my phone out and tried to get a few pictures of it.  I have one but the picture is very grainy.   After a few more minutes we went behind some trees and as we cane out on the other side the fireball had vanished.;28.7736104868922;-81.2849640449455

4 Orange Orbs Over Sanford, Florida, near airport.;2015-01-17 22:00:00;1 hour;4 Orange Orbs Over Sanford, Florida, near airport. I live in Sanford, FL, just around the corner of the Sanford airport.  Last night, I saw 4 orange/red glowing orbs above my house starting around 10:00pm.  The first one I saw while I was driving home.  It was hovering over a commercial building.   As soon as I stopped my car to see it better, it started moving north.  I got back in my car and drove home (about 4 blocks away).  I was watching it the whole time.  It eventually just vanished in an area that it didn't make sense for it to vanish.   As soon as I got home, I had to change the windshield wipers on my car.  I was telling my husband about what I just saw because it reminded me of a story our neighbor told us when we lived in Casselberry, FL, last year.  She had seen 3 orange lights flying above our house.  I had also seen similar lights when I lived in Pompano Beach, FL, about 2 years ago. As soon as I was done telling him what I’d just seen, another orange light came from over the horizon.  It flew in the same flight path as the first one I saw.  We sat there and watched it the whole time (roughly 5-7 minutes).  It flew right over our heads and did not make a sound. It seemed to be the size of a small car about 1,000 feet off the ground.  It disappeared right as we heard a jet from the airport taking off.   About 20 minutes later, as we were finishing replacing my windshield wipers, another orange light appeared, again in the same flight path as the other 2.  We watched that one appear over the horizon, and when it was about halfway through the path the other 2 had taken, yet another one appeared and flew the same path.  Right around the same place that the other 2 disappeared, so did these two.  It almost seems like they were going into an invisible mothership or something.  Because they weren't high enough to be hidden by clouds, and they weren't far enough to fall out of our range of sight. They were a dull orange (similar to metal halide street lights) around the front and sides.  The rear had red lights and some type of glowing red “antenna” could be visible form the back.  When they were directly above us, you could see a very faint white light alternating flashes from the front and back.  A couple hours later, helicopters flew nearby, you could hear them and see their flashing lights distinctly. Whatever the orange/red lights are, they are definitely not planes or helicopters. I've checked the box at the bottom about being contacted by an investigator.  These lights seem to be coming up near us for the last 3 years.  Coincidentally, that's how long I've known my husband.   Last year, after the neighbor told us she saw lights over our street, my husband told me about how he feels like he's been abducted when he was a kid.  He showed me a place on his foot that appeared after his apparent abduction (I think he said it was about 20 years ago).  Anyway, this spot on his foot looks like a drill hole and has not healed since he got it.   I'm wondering if there may be some correlation between his alleged abduction and the fact that it seems like I'm seeing UFOs all the time now. Please contact me by email.  Thanks!;28.7736104868922;-81.2849640449455
