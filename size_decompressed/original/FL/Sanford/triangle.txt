(fast,smooth flying craft) I was traveling on I-4 about 2 exits from my home exit. I look up and I see a blk triangle shape craft with 3 main white lights and 1 red blinking smaller light on the bottom. I was traveling east on I-4 it went to my left (north) then turning very easily in almost a sharpe turn and went back to my right(south) and floating easy away til it was out of my sight. I wanted to see it again but nothing. It was gone.;28.7736104868922;-81.2849640449455
Large, low, slow moving black triangular object with mulitple lights;2009-03-13 20:00:00;1 minute;Large, low, slow moving black triangular object with mulitple lights Between 8 and 9 pm on March 13, 2009, I along with the other witness spotted a triangular shaped craft hovering over a cemetery in Sanford Florida.  We were traveling west bound on a two-lane road, roughly 40 miles per hour.  We looked out of the drivers side window and noticed  the object.  It had multiple lights, probably around 5 or 6.  The majority of the lights were white but there was also one or two red ones located somewhere from the middle to the rear of the object.  At first we thought it was a plane, especially since there is a small airport located nearby, but it appeared to be stationary.  It was also extremely low but we were unable to hear any noise as we passed.   I couldn’t say exactly how far off the ground it was, but the height was equivalent to an extremely tall oak tree. Now as we were both passing, we both started to comment on the object at the same time.  We both noticed how low it was and how it appeared to be hovering or moving at an extremely slow speed.  First instinct was that it was just a plane on it’s way to the airport, but the speed, height, and sound just didn’t add up to the normal sightings of planes in that area.  Then the thought was that it was possibly some kind of stationary tower, such as a cell phone.  So once we passed the object, we decided to do a u-turn and go back and get a second look.  We had trouble finding a good place to do this and finally just slammed the breaks on  and turned into the other lane.   By the time we got back to  the spot where it was located, the object was gone. In hind sight, I wish we had just slammed the breaks on the moment we saw it.  There were no cars directly behind us and I don’t recall any other cars passing in the other lane at that same moment. I’m also surprised  at how I felt.  There was no uneasiness or frightened feeling.  Just a feeling of confusion.  The area in which it was spotted is also heavily populated.  In the same direction as the object was traveling, there is an apartment complex and a large high school, which are both located on the other side of the cemetery.  I would be extremely surprised  if no one else saw it.;28.7736104868922;-81.2849640449455
Cloud forms out of nowhere: 3 objects fly out of it!;2010-08-26 15:20:00;Approximately 3 minutes;Cloud forms out of nowhere: 3 objects fly out of it! I was leaning against my car while, looking up at the sky. I was facing north. At a distance (I’m not good at gagging distances,) I noticed a small pin point of what appeared to be a cloud.  It was tiny. This “dot” of cloud began expanding rapidly. It caught my attention and, while still staring at it, I called my mother. I pointed to the cloud and asked her to look at it, that the cloud was forming a fast pace. She did and, was as amazed as I was. A cloud formed out of nowhere! All of a sudden an object of some sort flew out of the cloud. My mother wondered if it was a bird. I responded: must be a huge bird, to be visible at that distance.  At that moment another object flew out of the same cloud that had just formed. My mother then ran inside grabbed her binoculars and watched as a third object flew out. The first object was heading towards us, the second headed East and the third, headed west. The objects disappeared in front of our eyes. They just banished. My mother told me that through the binoculars, the objects seemed to be metallic, triangular and looked reddish.  With the naked eye, it appeared round. It was a sunny afternoon with no clouds. The color she noted could have been the sun’s reflection.  I should note that a few years ago, my then fiancée and I witnessed a huge fireball that was traveling at a great speed.  It stopped midair as it changed colors. It got real bright, brilliant colors and “imploded.” It did not fly away or fall. It just imploded within itself. It left a thin trail of vapor or smoke. I am glad both times I’ve witnessed these occurrences, I have not being alone. Otherwise I would doubt my sanity.;28.7736104868922;-81.2849640449455
Triangular hovering projecting bright lights over lake near bridge;2011-07-22 21:40:00;5 seconds;Triangular hovering projecting bright lights over lake near bridge We missed our turn onto Lake Mary Boulevard and were driving down State road 46 heading east.   We saw some lights in the distance that seemed to be really clumped together to be street lights and much too bright.  When we drove by the lights were attached to a object that was hovering over the lake.   The object was making no noise.  The object was triangular shaped and projecting bright lights from each point and each side for a total of six lights.   When we finished crossing the bridge, we turned around to get back on course and check out the object again.  Not even a minute later we crossed the area again and there was no signs of the object, but there was a dark haze like cloud in the general area of the object.;28.7736104868922;-81.2849640449455
V-shaped Three Bright Lights in triangular formation flying and hovering low in the sky. Three witnesses;2014-03-19 21:45:00;2.5 minutes;V shaped Three Bright Lights in triangular formation flying and hovering low in the sky.  Three witnesses. Date: March 19, 2014.  Location: Sanford Fl.  While driving West on Rt. 46. Approximately 9:45 pm while driving, I saw a bright light flying towards us. It was low in the sky and the brightness and a flash caught our attention. I brought it to the attention of my grandsons.  Curiously we were in awe and then it appeared as two bright headlights, it looked like a “flying car”.  We laughed and likened it to a scene from Harry Potter but then we realized what we were seeing was not normal. The lights were too bright and too low in the sky—just above the tree line and no sound was heard.  As we drove closer, and we became diagonal we saw it was hovering and that it was a triangular object with three lights.  Unable to stop because of traffic we proceeded in the absolute knowledge that this was a UFO an aircraft that we were unfamiliar with.  No flashing red or green lights, no sound and way too close for comfort. Since there are three witnesses, I would like to add my grandson proposed that it may have been three objects flying in formation. Description of the backgrounds of the observers: Woman age 56 retired Counselor.  Two grandsons age 14 & 16.;28.7736104868922;-81.2849640449455
I was driving on I-4 headed east when I seen what I thought was an airplane because I was close to the Sanford Airport. As I got closer;2016-04-21 01:20:00;3 minutes;I was driving on I-4 headed east when I seen what I thought was an airplane because I was close to the Sanford Airport.  As I got closer to the St. Johns River, I noticed it wasn't moving, it had 5 white lights and two red lights and was triangular in shape it had a lower base on the shape that was rectangular this is where the two red lights were.  I'm doing bout 80 and I thought maybe it was just a tower so I'm looking, but I can't see any pod or any kind of stand that this thing is standing on these are just lights on a triangle shape with a rectangular shape on the bottom of the triangle.   As I'm driving, I passed a guy who's parked in the median with no hazards on or anything.  I realized later that he may have seen it too and was stopped and filming it, or taking a picture, and all the traffic that was behind me slowed way down, so I know they seen it too.  The aircraft hovered above the St. Johns River from the time I was in Sanford by the zoo all the way till I couldn't see it anymore which was passed DeBary.   Again the craft was triangular in shape with a rectangle base there were two red lights on the rectangular base and there were five lights 3 on each point of the triangular shape and two white ones about Midway down the sides of the craft.  It was about the length of half a football field it was about thirty feet above the St. Johns River and about 10 feet away from the bridge the object was clearly visible the lights were so bright I can't even explain it.  My windows were down and there was zero large engine noise.   My car and maybe 5 other cars behind me but absolutely no airplane, helicopter, nor drone sound was heard.;28.7736104868922;-81.2849640449455
