Silver sphere to the right of a cloud seen midday morning in area of Sanford Florida Feb 28, 2007.;2007-02-28 10:30:00;seconds;Silver sphere to the right of a cloud seen midday morning in area of Sanford Florida Feb 28, 2007. My daughter and I were enroute to a shopping mall midday February 28, 2007.  As I looked up in the sky I saw a silver looking object which could have been mistaken as a giant beach ball.  It was almost certainly the color that would blend with the sky but distinct enough that you know that it was not part of the sky.  It was a very clear day and somewhat average temperature. It appeared to be partially hid behind a cloud.  At the top of the sphere was an illumination of some kind that was almost white in color.  It appeared to be a reflection of the sun.  As quickly as I could ask my daughter if she saw it and then turned back to look at it again - it was gone.  She was driving and I was in the passenger seat.  I have never been so surprised in my life.  My daughter thought it was a weather balloon.  However I do not think that it was a weather balloon at all.  Thanks for allowing this to be entered.;28.7736104868922;-81.2849640449455
There were 3-5 low flying slow moving spherical objects moving horizontally across the sky on Halloween night, 8:40-9:00 PM 2013.;2013-10-31 08:45:00;very short;There were 3-5 low flying slow moving spherical objects moving horizontally across the sky on Halloween night, 8:40-9:00 PM 2013 I was driving my friend home from my apartment when I looked at the sky and saw 3 balloon-like objects floating extremely low over the sky.  I knew they weren't balloons though because 1) they glided sideways with ease, not erratically and 2) they never floated upwards, just sideways and 3) there were no strings attached, as there would be had a child lost their balloon.  They moved slowly, and I only got a short glimpse of them as I was driving, but they were light grey and entirely unmarked.   Another interesting aspect was at first I only saw 2 of them, but then one of the spheres seemed to split in half, and a third craft became visible, and then a fourth which also appeared from the same area as the other craft.  It looked like a fifth was emerging when I lost sight of them.  I don't know if I was just at a strange angle and saw them simply moving out from behind another craft or if they actually merged out from one another.  I couldn't get an image, unfortunately, of anything as traffic was somewhat chaotic and my eyes had to be on the road. I'm not entirely sure what I saw at all, ((NUFORC Note:  The party who submitted the report elects to remain totally anonymous, and provides no contact information, so we are unable to contact the witness.

Orange spheres over centrral Florida.;2017-08-19 21:30:00;10 minutes;Orange spheres over centrral Florida. I was driving into my neighborhood last night at approximately 9:30, and was preparing to park my car in my garage, when I glanced up in the southeast sky at my roofline and noticed three glowing, pulsating, orange orbs flying slowly in a northwesterly direction in a large triangular formation.  As far as size perspective goes--they were the size of a typical pearl bead held at arm's length. I estimate they were traveling at a distance of about 10-15,000 feet and were completely silent and their airspeed was approximately 200-300 mph.  The objectsâ€™ color never changed. I watched the objects break formation when they were directly overhead and begin moving in a somewhat straight line, as they gradually disappeared into the northwest sky. This part of the sighting lasted about 2-3 minutes. I then saw another of these objects traveling along the same flight path, approaching from the southeast sky, at which point, I ran inside my house to get my wife outside as a witness to what I was observing. We both watched this object through my binoculars as it headed in a straight line into the northwest sky.  Same estimated airspeed, size and distance as the other objects. Also, at this point, I noticed several neighbors down the street from us, standing in their front yards, watching these objects. We were both getting ready to go inside the house, when we noticed yet another of the objects, same size, flight path, speed, color, etc., traveling in exactly the same direction as the previously sighted objects. We watched as it gradually disappeared in the northwest sky. I estimate the total length of this sighting to be approximately 10-15 minutes. We waited outside for another 10 minutes but nothing else unusual was sighted. We are approximately 10 miles from Sanford-Orlando International Airport and are very used to seeing various types of commercial and sometimes military aircraft over the last 17 years.  I have also piloted single engine aircraft and have never seen anything like these objects before tonight.;28.7736104868922;-81.2849640449455
