Low flying round object with white circulating lights.;2012-05-04 20:30:00;1 minute;Low flying round object with white circulating lights I was driving down SR-46, near the I-4 overpass and witnessed a large slow moving object flying extremely low above me.  It was round and had bright circulating white lights.   I came to a stop at the red light, at the intersection where Don Pabloâ€™s is located.  I was able to look up and get a really good look at this object.  I could not believe how low to the ground it was.   As it moved, the object itself was slowly rotating, while the circulating lights seemed to chase each other around the object.   The light turned green and I had to go with the flow of traffic, so I lost sight of it as it was now behind me.   However, once I reached my destination, about a mile up the road, I saw the object again.  It was still moving at the same pace.   I stood in the parking lot and watched it for a few seconds until it was out of sight again.  I did not hear any noise from the object.

Perfect circle of yellow dots of light in the sky at approx 4pm that appeared then disappeared.;2015-12-19 16:00:00;1-2 seconds;Perfect circle of yellow dots of light in the sky at approx 4pm that appeared then disappeared. On Saturday, December 19, 2015, between 3 and 4 pm, I witnessed a circle of clear, distinct yellow lights appear in the sky and then disappear.  I would explain it as if a light switch had been turned on and then off in the sky.  The shape was a perfect circle.   I witnessed it from my vehicle, windows down.  My two children were with me but did not see it, as it only appeared for a brief moment.  We were pulling out of the Sanford Municipal Cemetery on 46A facing north - the object was in the northeastern sky.  The sky was grey overcast yet clear with mild temperature. It was  distinct.   My immediate thought was that the sight was strange, - I had never seen something like that in the sky, but then I dismissed the lights as having been either a firework or blown transformer.  I mentioned to my 9-yr-old son that I saw the lights and he asked me if it looked like a ferris wheel - which is exactly what it reminded me of - but it didn't have spokes&qu! ot in the center, just the perfect dots of light.  He said he had read about ferris wheel UFO's - I dismissed his statement.  I am submitting this report today (approx 2wks later) because I have yet to figure out what I saw.  There were no fireworks sounds at the time - and the circle was perfect, not oval, slanted, etc.  I had never seen anything like this before.

3 unidentified bright orange objects travelling in the same direction;2019-12-31 23:23:00;5 minutes;3 unidentified bright orange objects travelling in the same direction 3 bright orange objects were seen by a husband and wife age 64 and 58, and their relative, an 88 year old woman visiting from England.  The wife is a senior airport supervisor, and the husband, a professional health-medical writer.  The objects were moving together in a straight line with a distance between them, travelling from north north west to south west toward Oviedo or Titusville, FL.  The objects were solid and consistent in their appearance during the duration of the sighting.  There was no sound heard, and no flashing or blinking lights.  Their height is hard to determine as their size could not be discerned, but wife thinks the height could have been around 15,000 feet or so.;28.7736104868922;-81.2849640449455
Floating Pulsating Orb;2020-09-26 05:00:00;6-8 minutes;Floating Pulsating Orb My dog woke me up Saturday morning around 5am to go out.  While I was out I saw a bright white orb on the horizon.  I watched and took video for about 6 minutes.  It pulsated and moved several times coming back to hover.  It pulsated red a few times.  Ultimately ended up hearing a weird bird or Predator sound and went back inside.  Very Strange;28.7736104868922;-81.2849640449455
