Two oblong objects flying in formation near Orlando International Airport;2007-09-14 00:00:00;2 minutes;Two oblong objects flying in formation near Orlando International Airport I was driving home from the office about 10:45am on 09/14/07. I was on SR-417 when I happened to glace out and up out of the drivers side window. I saw two objects flying in formation, one slightly behind and to the left of the lead craft. It was clear with scattered cumulous clouds. What struck me most was the brightness of the craft, brighter and whiter than the clouds they flew in front of. At first I thought it was two jetliners, but I know that commercial liners do not fly in formation and also because there were no visible vertical stabilizers on these two craft. Plus their shape appeared to be like a 2x4 board. They were flying north to south, but could not estimate the altitude, although they seemed quit big and close. About this time there was a Southwest Airliner heading north out of Orlando International Airport. The objects were bigger than the commercial jet. They seemed to pass over the airliner, but I can't say if they were actually over the plane, it just looked like it from my perspective. As the airliner passed, the trailing object did a 90 degree turn to the right although I couldn't actually see it turn, it just went from going south to going west without any sign of deceleration, but it did seem to pick up speed and move rapidly away. By the time I got my vehicle pulled over to the side of the road the objects were gone.;28.7736104868922;-81.2849640449455
