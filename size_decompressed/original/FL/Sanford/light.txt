Traveling east on I4 I spotted a bright white light w/ 2 flashing red lights;2003-11-14 19:30:00;15 min;Traveling east on I4 I spotted a bright white light w/ 2 flashing red lights.  The light was about 1000 feet up and the flashing red lights were about 50 ft. below the bright white light.  The craft was traveling right above I4 approx. 50-60 mph without making any noise.  The sky was quickly cluttered with planes and jets.  As one jet approached the light, the light quickly accelerated and was out of sight in a matter of seconds.;28.7736104868922;-81.2849640449455
Unusual lights in Sanford Florida;2006-07-30 00:00:00;over 1 hour;Unusual lights in Sanford Florida On July 29, 2006 at approximately 11:45 pm, I was sitting on the back porch of my house looking at the stars.  Nothing unusual but then I noticed one was moving in unusual patterns and was flashing red light.  It would hover without any movement then it would suddenly move in strange directions.  It darted left, then right, then forward, then backward in random patterns.  It even made half circles, full circles, and a figure 8.  I called my family out to see it because I couldn't figure out what it was.  It wasn't a plane because of the patterns and it wasn't a helicopter because it was so far up in the sky.  This went on for about an hour until it faded in the distance.  I called the local police and they said they had no other reports.  I then noticed another one several miles away from the first one which was still visible.  Finally I went out in front of the house and noted a third.  Also while this was occuring, there were continuous flashes of white light which appeared to be closer to the ground.  It was not raining and the skies were clear with no reports of thundstorms in the area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Bright round lights appear in sky after the launch of the Delta IV Rocket @ Cape Canaveral.;2013-08-07 20:30:00;5 minutes;Bright round lights appear in sky after the launch of the Delta IV Rocket @ Cape Canaveral. August 7, 2013   Dear Peter,  	 This evening at 8:30 PM, I was outside getting my horses in for the evening when I looked up in the sky and saw the curly white contrail of what I thought may have been a rocket launch from Cape Canaveral.  I live in Sanford, Florida, and as the crow flies about 40 miles from The Cape.   I have a good view of any rocket launch and have viewed multiple shuttle launches right from my yard.  I was not happy that I had missed a launch--which later this evening I did confirm was a Delta IV rocket.  This time of year, 8:30 in the evening is still daylight and hot!   As I was looking at the curly contrail, I noticed a VERY bright round light to the left of the contrail.  It was not moving.  It was not an airplane or helicopter.  I am in the path of the airplanes coming and going from Sanford Airport. – so believe me, I know what an airplane looks like.  No stars were out yet.   As I was focusing on the bright round light, a line of smaller white lights appeared to the right of the large rou! nd light. It happened so quickly.  I am not sure if there were 4 or 6 round lights and I could not determine if the lights were parallel to the large white light horizontally or vertically.   For a brief moment, it seemed like I was looking at the lights through a sheer white curtain and what appeared to be an outline was visible which made me think that the smaller lights were actually part of a triangle shaped object.  It was brief and the thought or shape was no longer there but the lights remained. As I was watching the lights, I called my friend and neighbor to come outside to look too.  As it turned out, she was in her car driving to the grocery store about 3 miles away.  She was watching the white contrails and also saw the large white light but she could not see any more than 2 of the smaller lights.   We stayed on the phone with each other for about 5 minutes watching the lights and the contrail.  Oddly enough, above the contrail was a very strange cloud that appeared to be brightly illuminated as if there were lights inside or above where we could not see.  There were very few other clouds in the sky and none of them had the brilliance of this one. For all of this time, the large round light never moved nor did the line of smaller lights.  There were small planes off in the distance with their lights clearly visible.  As the white contrail began to disperse, a few of the smaller lights disappeared.  The bright cloud was still very bright.  The last 3 lights remaining were the large round white light and two of the smaller lights to the right of that large light.  Then all 3 lights just faded out.  The contrails faded and the very bright “cloud” was the last to disperse after I would say about 10 minutes ((NUFORC Note:  There was a rocket launch out of Cape Canaveral at 20:29 hrs. on this date.  However, that does not appear to explain the other sighting, described by the witness.  PD));28.7736104868922;-81.2849640449455
Large bright white light as if an aircraft was soon to land but no flashing/strobe lights at all then disappeared.;2014-09-18 21:30:00;15 seconds;large bright white light as if an aircraft was soon to land but no flashing/strobe lights at all then disappeared Bright white light as if it was a large aircraft/plane but was soon to land.  (There is an airport nearby but the reason this caught my attn is because there were no red or blue flashing lights identifying it as a plane.  Just the white light as if a headlight and it was the brightest i've ever seen.  I seen this object go through a very dense cloud as if it were fog but as it was exiting out, it was gone completely disappeared.;28.7736104868922;-81.2849640449455
I saw these lights, it was too low for a plane and it couldn't be a drone due to so many trees in the area. ((anonymous report));2017-12-17 21:00:00;I honestly don't know;I was outside by my car when I saw these lights, it was too low for a plane and it couldn't be a drone due to so many trees in the area I spotted it at...I could see it moving through the trees,  I watch d it for about 4 minutes straight before I decided to get the hell out of there.  It was like 4 street lights in a line flying about 12 feet in the air. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
