4 Red-Orange Orbs appear, move rapidly and soundlessly, then flicker out.;2011-08-13 21:12:00;Approx. 3 minutes;4 Red-Orange Orbs appear, move rapidly and soundlessly, then flicker out. While walking my girlfriend out to her car she and I noticed my two dogs acting strangely and looking into the woods behind our property.  Just then behind the tree line moving at a steady pace almost as if floating were two red-orange orbs followed at a distance by a third.  They did not move like any airplane I have ever seen they were moving at a steady pace but were drifting in a somewhat sideways motion while still moving forward, like fireflies sometimes do.  The moon was full and the orbs appeared to be about 30 percent of its size.  I sent my girlfriend inside to get my grandmother while I watched these three orbs sort of flicker out and vanish.  My grandmother came outside and as we were describing the three objects we saw to her a fourth one appeared and followed the same direction the other three had gone, we all three (my girlfriend, my grandmother and I) watched this last orb until it too flickered out.  However this time as it the light flickered out! my grandmother and girlfriend said that they could still see it moving without the light and that it appeared triangular in shape.
