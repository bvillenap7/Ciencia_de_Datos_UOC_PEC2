Dozens of orbs clearly seen cruzing in Pasco County, Florida.;2008-12-19 12:20:00;1 minute;Dozens of orbs clearly seen cruzing in Pasco County, Florida. Dozens of Orbs December 19, 2008,  12:20pm Dade City, Fl  On Friday I was working in my house. I had to make a trip out to my tool shed for some materials. On exiting I looked up into a beautiful blue partly cloudy sky only to see dozens, I would say at least 75 to 100 metallic orbs headed from due east to due west. These orbs were quite easy to see so I had no need to run into the house for my binoculars. Rather than flying in formation they were spread out but in reference to each were fairly close in the group which was quite a many orbs. Following behind broken away from the group was about 15-20 more. I had about a minute to examine these orbs as they went from about 60 degrees East to about 70 degrees West before they either went into or over  clouds . Their size was about the size of a BB held in your hand. They were all the same size and description. Their speed was as if they were on a Sunday drive and there was absolutely no noise. We are in the inbound path for Tampa International Airport and I could not help but notice that there was no action for a good while. There was very little wind and the temp was about 78º. The orbs didn’t reflect very much light, that is to say that my vision was not hampered by glare, each was clearly visible. I was able so see them so well that I could tell that these objects were round orbs gliding smoothly through the skies, not birds, as I said, I could see them clearly. Neither were they planes or ultra-lights or swamp gas. They were a mass of silent running genuine UFO. I shook for about thirty minutes after the sighting and waited for about an hour before calling the report in. I wanted to get my thoughts together.

Bright white light covered surface object moving very slowly towards northwest;2018-05-27 10:00:00;45 minutes;Bright white light covered surface object moving very slowly towards northwest At approximately 10 pm, 5/27/18, my wife and I departed a relative’s residence in San Antonio, FL, to return to our home 6 miles to the east in Dade City, FL.  As I stepped out I noticed what I thought was a very bright star, brighter than any other stars in the night sky.  I commented how bright it was to my wife and two relatives.  We began to question if the object was a star, and noted that the object was moving very slowly.  One of the relatives got their binoculars and each of us used them in an effort to identify the object.  Each of us said the object appeared to have some type of very bright white lights surrounding its entire surface, with my wife’s sister describing the lights as being arranged in a diamond pattern.  We continued watching the object for about 5 minutes and then my wife and I headed home. Upon arriving home 15-20 minutes later, I looked toward the west and spotted the object.  It was moving very slowly toward the north, at about 40-50 degrees above the horizon.  I attempted to photograph the object using a telephoto lens, however, without the aid of a tripod the photograph is not sharp, and is not a good representation of what 4 of us observed.  I watched the object until it disappeared beyond the horizon.;28.3404867088607;-82.2424639240507
