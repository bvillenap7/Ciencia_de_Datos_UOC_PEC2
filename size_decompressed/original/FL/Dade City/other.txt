As a past-time I use the Google Earth program to scan the earth's land and waters for things that appear to be anomalies or unusually symmetrical in shape.   On 9-3-12 as I was scanning coastal waters and saw an unusual item that caught my attention.  When I zoomed in to the sea floor, the item had several symmetrical features that peaked my interest.  I made a close-up image capture of the item with Google's snapshot feature and emailed it to myself.  I knew right away that this was something significant due to it's totally unfamiliar shape and features.  Using my Corel Paint Shop Pro-Photo X-2 software I was able to adjust the satellite image and lighten and darken areas to get a more acceptable image.  I am including the original image I downloaded from Google Earth and the enhanced images so you can see that they are still the same image, just enhanced for clarity.  I will also include an image with the reflective surfaces highlighted in green due to some people having a hard time distinguishing the item from the sea floor.  I have reported this find to Earthfiles.com, MUFON, Ground-Zero, Coast to Coast and now NUFORC.  I am reporting this to as many places as I can and as quick as I can to make sure that the image and knowledge that it is still there is not hushed up.  After eliminating the water surface effect I was able to see that the craft had originally been perched on the edge of the plateau in the upper right of the image. It appears that the edge broke away and the craft then slid to the sea floor.  The halo effect around the craft is due to the displacement of the floor sand and sediment.  After many enhancements to the original image I can see that this craft is severely if not fatally damaged.  The Google Earth map for this area is the National Geological Survey map dated 2012.   Please contact me for the coordinates if you are interested in pursuing an investigation into this.;28.3404867088607;-82.2424639240507
