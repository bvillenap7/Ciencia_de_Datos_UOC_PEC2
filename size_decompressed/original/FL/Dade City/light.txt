To the northeast, a bright white light was seen, steady and non-moving.  Then, I noticed that the light was becoming brighter and moving toward me.  I would estimate that it traveled about 2 miles to the southwest...it was moving every so slowly over downtown Dade City.  Then, in a blink of an eye, it flashed and zipped off to the southeast and was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
