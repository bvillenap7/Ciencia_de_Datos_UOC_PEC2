White-Green, Teardrop shaped light falling from the sky at approx 12:20 am in Dade City, FL.  ((NUFORC Note:  Meteor??  PD));2010-06-25 00:20:00;A few seconds;White-Green, Teardrop shaped light falling from the sky at approx 12:20 am in Dade City, FL. At about 12:20 am, my sister and I were driving home, when we saw a white-green object falling from the sky.  It did not look like it was traveling in any particular direction, but falling straight down.  It looked relatively close, but when we tried to follow it, it was farther south than we thought.   My first impression was that it may have been a plane crashing, but it just appeared to be an oddly shaped (almost like a teardrop) ball of light or fire falling straight down from the sky.  It appeared to have a aura or haze around it, and a very short tail (if any tail at all.)   My sister and I were both witnesses to this event, but we did not see any crash or sign of destruction in the direction we watched the object fall.;28.3404867088607;-82.2424639240507
