I was driving home from work as I approached a hill driving north on Pasco 41, I observed a bright yellow light to the west, it continued to drop to the earth at a slow speed, at about 300 feet, it remained stationary for a few seconds. Then it assended in a full circle and went north east at a high rate of speed, saw a red light in the center of its yellowish body. I heard no noise from any engines during this period;28.3404867088607;-82.2424639240507
