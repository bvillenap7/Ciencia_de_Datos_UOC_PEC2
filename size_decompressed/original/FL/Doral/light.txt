I like smoking there cause i have a nice view of a lake and all i can see how the moon reflects on the lake.  The night was cool and there were no clouds just in the distance that look like fog in the sky. It was really high in the sky and it capture my attention how these little tiny lights were going around and disappearing and it looked like they were crashing with one another.  There was a plane underneath and i thought it was the plane's lights or something.  The plane would get closer the lights would get brighter and motion was faster.  It came to a point that the plane past by me and the lights were still in the same place. I started to wonder if what i was seeing was for real, tiny little lights shaped like little jupiters going around in circles around and around looking like they would crash.  I stared at it and i would see how from 6 lights i was seeing it was dimishing one by one each one going around for the last time and disapperaing, i would not see where it would go until i saw the last one leave. i was not afriad but excited that i was able to experiment this.  I wish i knew if what i saw were flying saucers or maybe just thunder or advertisment lights. but there was not anything coming from the ground.  Tommorrow i'll go and see again....;25.8006384615385;-80.3464
