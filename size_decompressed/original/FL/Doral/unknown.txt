Unusual flight patterns and missile like objects in Doral Flo.  ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photos, and suspect contrails;2011-01-29 17:42:00;12-15 min;Unusual flight patterns and missile like objects in Doral Florida From:  ((name deleted))  Re: Unusual Sighting On January 29th 2011 at around 5:40 I observed an object descending from the sky in a vertical direction . My first thought was that a plane was coming down , then it continued to descend leaving a huge curved Contrail that made an unusual turn and then a vertical drop ,larger than any plane can make…I can not see an object ,just the path it took.. It was moving very fast and it came very low. I live on a fifth floor and my balcony faces west and south west.  It was at a distance but I can see that it made contact with another object and after a minutes I saw what appears to be a missile like object propel from the ground and shoot up to the sky where it continued traveling until it disappeared into the sky….I contacted the airport and was told that there were no unidentified objects on their radar….All this activity took about 12-15 min…;25.8006384615385;-80.3464
