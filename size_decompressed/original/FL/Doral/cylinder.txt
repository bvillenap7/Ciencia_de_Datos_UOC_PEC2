2 cylindrical objects with ultra-fast movements captured by the camera at midnight for more than 5 hours on the same site;2020-07-07 00:00:00;5 hours;2 cylindrical objects with ultra-fast movements captured by the camera at midnight for more than 5 hours on the same site We want to report that we have evidence of what we consider can qualify as UFO captured by our doorbell video camera. This happened on July 7th, 2020. We have a video sequence of a flying object with extremely fast movements on almost the same point from midnight until about 6:00 a.m. the same day. In the video it is appreciated how the object seems to separate and then rejoin or what appears to be two objects that meet and disappear without following a pattern. After 6:11 am the object disappeared. We found out today because I told my wife that I saw a rare movement of an intense light in the parking lot (near the object) on the night of July 7th, 2020 and when reviewing the video she could see that on the other side of that light there was a strange movement of an object.  That is the object that I have just described above. Everything is documented in the video without editing at all. Important Notice:  I will send fragments of the video sequence where faces of some people who passed in front of our camera do not appear. By the way, those people did not seem to notice the flight of these objects.;25.8006384615385;-80.3464
