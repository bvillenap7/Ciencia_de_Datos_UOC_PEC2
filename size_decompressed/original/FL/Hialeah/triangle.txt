Anomalies in the Sky;2013-07-11 10:05:00;1/667;Anomalies in the Sky 07/11/203 - Driven on the Palmetto Expressway going North about 2 miles from Hialeah was flying the Good Year Zeppelin, I took my cell and take about 6 pictures, once at home going thru the pictures I discover two very tiny bright dots just on the right side,in the blue sky. Once focus on the dots I start bringing then to close up the max available zoom in my cell, this shows two triangle objects expelling gases almost on vertical position.  Other scenario capture,by another picture, just on the right side, I noticed other dots, doing the same trick with the zoom this time I found ten triangle objects in the sky displaying a formation 3-2-2-2.  On another picture I discover another object this means that out of the 6 pictures taken in 3 of them showing anomalies impossible to be seen by the naked eye.  The pictures still on my cell awaiting for a logical explanation. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));25.8919791304348;-80.3226523913046
