I was looking at the moon eclipse on January 20, 2000 at 10:00pm.  At 10:30 pm on the south west sky I saw a shooting star so I turn my head and saw the light of the shooting star disapearing and appearing an object with wings.  They were two wings and something in the middle of them but it was not an airplaine it look more like a handglider but did not have any lights at all.  It was a clear night so I so it perfectly. The object was brounish grenish on the bottom of the wings.  So when the object stoped in middle air like loosing control all of the sudden took off vertically and then it went sideways(zigzag) very fast and then it took off south very fast and disapear in the orizon.  I have no idea what it was but I am sure others saw it because was the night of the loonar eclipse and many people were looking up.  Can you check and see if anybody else saw what I saw?  It is like a scene from a comic strip.;25.8919791304348;-80.3226523913046
Wierd object flying above Miami skies.;2001-10-14 00:30:00;06:00:am;Wierd object flying above Miami skies. I first saw the object in the western skies over Hialeah, Florida (in Miami) on Saturday night, October 14th, 2001 from 12:30am-4:00am. The object appeared like a star but was zig-zagging in the night sky. When I looked through my binoculers, I noticed that it appeared much like a jellyfish with two limbs and a light source inside. I contacted a friend who lives about 10 miles further west from me and he confirmed the object in the same westerly direction. The object also would dissapear behind clouds making the object higher in the sky then it really appeared. My family witnessed the object along side of me and discribed the object as a  jellyfish-like object with two legs and a light inside. I thought it looked more like a frog with two legs and with a light inside. We all agreed that it looked and moved much like a kite would and not a weather balloon. Weather balloons are usually oval or tear-drop shaped. Additionally, how could a kite fly well above the clouds? If anyone else witnessed the same thing feel free to contact me so we can exchange experiences. Thanks!! ((name deleted));25.8919791304348;-80.3226523913046
