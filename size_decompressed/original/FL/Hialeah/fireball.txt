Bright Ball Across the Sky;2001-09-02 20:00:00;10 sec;Bright Ball Across the Sky We were seating by a Lake, when we saw an airplane approaching for a landing ( there is a small airport in this area )he was approaching from the West, when we looked up, across in front of the airplane, traveling from North to South we saw a giant green ball that streaked across the sky, but it was very low, it could have been a meteor, it was very bright green color. ((NUFORC Note:  Many reports of this event.  We thing the correct time for the event may be later than indicated here, however, and others reported that the apparent meteor (??) was traveling from south to north.

A green fireball fell from the sky in the distance, with no trail or tail.;2011-04-29 03:00:00;1-2 seconds;A green fireball fell from the sky in the distance, with no trail or tail. I saw a green fireball falling from the sky last Thursday evening, very early Friday at 3 in the morning.   I was sitting outside of a Starbucks with my friends talking like we regularly do.  I was sitting with a clear view of the eastern sky, and a view of the northern sky that was blocked off by the building. It was very cloudy and humid, but otherwise a nice tolerable night.   I was looking at one friend explaining a documentary, when over his right shoulder in the sky, I saw a green fireball with no trail or tail fall toward the ground from the sky.  It appeared from behind a cloud, disappeared behind another cloud as it descended, reappeared, and finally disappeared for the final time amongst the clouds. It travelled at the speed of like a spark that falls from fireworks, or a descending flare.  All in all, after doing research I am positive this wasn't a meteor or anything of the sort.  None of it seems to fit the bill of what I saw. For informational purposes, I am a 21 year old college student. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite reliable, and credible.  PD));25.8919791304348;-80.3226523913046
Fireball UFO zooms away at warp speed making no sound.;2011-08-05 01:13:00;3 seconds;Fireball UFO zooms away at warp speed making no sound. As I stepped out of the car in a parking lot late one night with 2 friends, I looked up to the sky. I saw what a appeared to be a glowing ball of light.  It was pretty dim, I described it as a fireball because it looks a lot like the fireball UFO pictures posted on this site.  The second I saw it, I said Holy S**t and pointed my finger in the direction for my friends to see.  While they are turning around, the light got a little brighter and it zoomed away. It dissapeared out of my site in less than a second.  And IT MADE ABSOLUTELY NO NOISE.  So they turn around, see nothing, and think I am playing around.  They tell me to swear to God, My Mother and several other things.  And then they said they beleived that I really thought I saw it, but that it was probably my imagination. But I know what I saw.  And it definitely was not my imagination.  I am 3rd year college student with a 4.0 gpa.  Tomorrow I will go back to my regular life and not really care much about this ever happening. It was an awesome experience though.  Too bad nobody ever beleives stories like these.;25.8919791304348;-80.3226523913046
Fireball inside a circle viewing over Hialeah on 12/22/12 at approx 2200 hrs. !!!!;2012-12-22 22:00:00;3-4 minutes;Fireball inside a circle viewing over Hialeah on 12/22/12 at approx 2200 hrs. !!!! We had had a Christmas get-together at my parents home, I had not had anything to drink as I am usually assigned driver duties to take someone home who had too much to drink that evening.   As I accompanied a family of 7 to their car we noticed that the entire block across the street from my parents home (a school) had police on either end cordoning off the area all of a sudden I we all see this fireball inside a circle slowly move towards us from north to south at a speed of about 5 mph.   As soon as this object passes us the entire police contingent drives off in a southern direction and that was it.  I did not and have not read any accounts of this online, in face book nor in you tube so far I hope we were not the only ones to see this spectacle.;25.8919791304348;-80.3226523913046
