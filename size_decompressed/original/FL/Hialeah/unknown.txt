On that day it was at around 8pm. Saturday sighting was me by myself and have footage of the sighting, which was below level for about 3-4 minutes. It looked like a longated sperm if you will, which was shapeshifting quite rapidly in growth and size.  Appeared pretty high in the sky & them suddenly dropped unbelievably pretty low! It flew away rapidly and as it disappeared in an upward motion... Tonight, to my utter shock and disbelief I saw it again along iwith someone else this time... same object, like a longated, that of teardrop.. like a giant sperm..  color was white/ that of grayish white.  This time it was shapeshifting from a longated sperm to a triangular shape...& again rose up rather quickly but before doing so, it spun around slowly.  7 minutes it lasted...  Back when I was 5 years old me and my sister saw a ufo outside of our kitchen window.  We yelled to our parents, my dad came running w/his new camera in tow (1981) my father’s camera was brand new w/the 4 flash cubes you would attach to it.  Once he saw what we saw he quickly attempted to take a snap of the ship (large ship object we all witnessed that night including my mother... the camera broke! Now in the sighting just now i am convinced that it was 7 minutes, although they are claiming I stood motionless and in shock for an hour or so by the window!  Claiming that I looked spellbound. It felt like 7 m! inutes but they claim I stood still and in shock in front of my window for an hr! My ears rang the entire time tonight, as I saw this ufo... what is puzzling to me is that my ears were ringing pretty bad & had it been an hour I would’ve been aware of that notion due to the fact that the noise was unbearable to say the least!;25.8919791304348;-80.3226523913046
