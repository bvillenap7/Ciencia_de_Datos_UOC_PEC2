sunlike sphere;1994-10-09 21:05:00;4 minutes;sunlike sphere There was only one craft. It was first seen by my younger brother (9 at the time) and his two friends from the house across the street. They started at it for about one minute before bringing it to our attention. By the time I was told about it and ran outside approximately two minutes had passed. I went outside thinking it was a joke my brother and his friends were trying to pull on me. But when I looked straight up I knew I was never going to see anything like this for the rest of my life. I called out for everyone in the house to come out and see. It was a circular shaped object with a very light triangle shaped ring around it. The bottom section of the sphere glowed to a bright orange like the color of the sun, and then it would dim down again. It continude to do this for the whole time we were looking at it. We all got a perfect view of it, the sky was perfectly clear and the object was only about 500 ft above us. It made no noise, and we were all in such aw that we made no noise either. It slowly left to the east until we could see it anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));25.8919791304348;-80.3226523913046
