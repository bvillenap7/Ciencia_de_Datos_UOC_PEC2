Three black, oblong objects in the vicinity of Hialeah east of the Palmetto Expressway;2011-08-19 13:34:00;20-25 Seconds;I saw while driving on the Palmetto Expressway on way to work while traveling South three black, oblong objects in the vicinity of Hialeah east of the Palmetto Expressway.  Objects appeared stationary for 5-10 seconds then moved erratically over the Palmetto Expressway from East to West, then back to East before vanishing.  The objects changed in color from black to a reflective almost chrome color as it moved back and forth over the highway.  I could not get my cell phone camera open in time to photograph. 	This was located between Opa Locka airport and Miami International but objects moved far to rapidly to be commercial or military aircraft.;25.8919791304348;-80.3226523913046
