Light flying in the sky like an insect.;2010-08-16 21:00:00;1 minute;Light flying in the sky like an insect. I was on vacation in Florida, taking a nap. My aunt's house sits on a lake line with houses all around the edge of it.  I was just waking up for dinner as my girlfriend was coming in. She stopped and shouted an expletive to which point I jumped up to see what she was looking at. All the way on the other side of the lake above the houses and maybe half a mile behind them (3/4 of a mile from my location), was a light that looked to be the same color as a star but brighter jumping around and basically moving like a bee or a fly all over the sky.  I didn't believe what I was seeing.  We went to grab my dad and went out to the back porch, but it was gone. We watched all night for it again.  There is a lot of air traffic in the area to compare it too and it's movements and distances traveled were just not humanly possible.  I don't know what I saw and I'm not going to say it's an extraterrestrial, but it was definitely unidentified. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Red light in NW sky appeared to be star but moving Southward and vanished.  Not a Shooting star.;2014-01-22 21:15:00;1 minute;Red light in NW sky appeared to be star but moving Southward and vanished. Not a Shooting star. Tonight 01-22-2014 around 9:15 pm I was facing North on my way back into the house with my dog, I looked up into the sky around the area of Cassiopeia, I noticed a red light (about as big as the stars around it) which at first I thought was a high altitude jet.  It was moving southward and as it passed between the upper portion of this star constellation, it kind of dimmed, came back and went out.  Not really a fade but in between a fade and being turned off. I would say it was a meteor but I have seen hundreds of those and this thing was not going at meteor speed like a shooting star (meteor).  It was moving smoothly though. It reminded me of when I was a kid and we could see the space station making its orbit. However, that didn't disappear, it went over the horizon. I know jets etc, and there were actually two other high altitude jets in the sky as well. Different areas of the sky but were obviously jets because of the other lights blinking on the them, white and green as well as red. This thing was not blinking.
