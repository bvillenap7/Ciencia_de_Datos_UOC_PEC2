Giant orange ball of light rising from the woods, and had no noise to it.;2005-06-20 21:30:00;2 min.;Giant orange ball of light rising from the woods, and had no noise to it. It was about 9:30 p.m when me and my brother went outside to take the trash out, we have a one acre property in a wooded are outside city limits. When we walked towards the back of the yard which was completely dark I noticed a big orange light coming up from the woods. Now I can pretty much distinguish it wasn't something normal due to the size of the light, it was about the size of a small compact car. The object was around a quarter of a mile away and about 50-100 feet off the ground as it was just starting to rise from the trees. I told my brother what the hell is that in the sky and when he seen it he immediately started running back towards the house, not wanting to stay by myself in the dark wooded area I ran with him. Now there is only 1 street light around this neighborhood and it was on the other side of our house across the street. There aren't to many homes around the area which makes is pretty dark at night. It was pretty clear it was not something normal. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
