Upon following the lights two more appeared to its lower left.  I proceeded to get closer and to take video and the two lights suddenly disappeared but the three initial lights remained in the sky.  I took several quick photos and noticed that the three lights had some type of motion, i.e., gases or clouds, smoke behind them like when a plane is flying and it leaves a trail in the sky.  It was dark/night and this happened three days after the supermoon appeared in the sky.  I heard no noise and suddenly the three lights vanished at one time as if someone switched off a light switch...something strange is happening in Frostproof.
