Chevron Shape Bright Object in the Northern Sky;2012-10-12 19:00:00;60 seconds;Chevron Shape Bright Object in the Northern Sky Looking north (Flying west) this self illuminating object caught my attention. The Sun was already set and gone. So this was not a residual prism effect (or whatever else you want to call it) illumination. What was so amazing was, as it flew in FRONT of a cloud, it was actually BRIGHTER than the white clouds. Then when it flew past that cluster of cloud, it maintained its original color.  Its color came from within. It was self coloring from the core.  No human words, that I have been taught, can explain this.

(2) Boomerang shaped crafts spotted over Lake Worth, FL heading south;2013-09-26 21:30:00;3-4 minutes;(2) Boomerang shaped crafts spotted over Lake Worth, FL heading south Saw a boomerang shaped craft gliding just above the clouds heading south. The craft was silent and did not have any lights.  About 3 minutes after spotting the first craft, another craft, identical in size and shape appeared and followed the same trajectory as the first. Having a military background in aviation,  I am positive that this is something I have never seen before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
