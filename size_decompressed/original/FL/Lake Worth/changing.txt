Possible UFO 3/19/2010 Lake Worth,FL night of the Super Moon;2011-03-19 22:00:00;5 mins;Possible UFO 3/19/2010 Lake Worth, FL, night of the Super Moon On the night of the super moon I headed down to the Lake Worth Pier so I could watch it rise and take pics.  Spent a while down there so it was about 9:40 possibly 10 when I was looking into the sky and seen what at first appeared to be a fireball,then started looking like just an Orange orb,  And the last shots I got of it it look like a long white line.I got close up pics of all of it.  This thing moved fast and would disappear and reappear.Like flashing but it was dark as could be out and one second it was there then it would be gone only to return a few times more.;26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388
