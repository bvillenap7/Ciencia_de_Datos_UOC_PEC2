Self illuminating rod-chevron shape near West Palm Beach;2012-10-12 19:00:00;60 seconds;Self illuminating rod-chevron shape near West Palm Beach I want to amend my report from last night because the shape I choose is misleading and this too important. What I saw was more like a rod with a slight crinkle towards the middle.  I hesitate to use this next description (because I know it wasn't) but it was like a flock of (self illuminating) birds.  That's why I chose the shape 'chevron' last night. This looked like no other UFO I've seen in person or photo.  It was quite bright flying from northeast to southwest. When it flew in front of the cloud, it was brighter than the cloud itself (the Sun had already set for this was almost 8PM 10-12-12)and when it got past the cloud, the color remained the same.  The brightness came from within. I'd very roughly estimate this being 10,000-asl and flying around 100-mph.;26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388
