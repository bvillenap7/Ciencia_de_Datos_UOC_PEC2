Triangle at night, no lights or sound fast.;2006-03-10 01:00:00;2 minutes;Triangle at night, no lights or sound fast. I was homeless at the time and happened to be lying down in a field on a clear evening.  While looking at the night sky I noticed a black w/ brownish tinge colored ufo traveling east over the atlantic  (I was about 1 mile from shore). The first thing I did after watching for a few seconds was to close one eye and check with the other and then visa versa.  It was a triangular shape approximately the size of a Boeing 737.  The shape was rounded at the corners and was wider than it was in length.  I would estimate the altitude at 20,000 feet.  The vehicle had no lights and absolutely no sound could be heard. Based on the fact that it blacked out stars as as it traveled and again estimating altitude at around 20k this thing was moving.  Noticeably faster that a commercial flight and the speed I would estimate at mach 2+  I am adament about the speed, which is strange as anything traveling that fast (I'm being conservative on the speed)should be making some sort of sound or at least have nav lights. I am an Air Force veteran and have seen SR-71's as I was at Beale AFB I worked on the flightline so I've seen a lot of aircraft.  It was not a F-117.  That's just a side note. There is no doubt in my mind that what I saw is not something that is currently being flown by any country.  It was quiet where I was, no traffic, just silence as this went by. I watch a lot of discovery channel and know what ramjets and pulse detonation engines are, scramjets, etc. I have no idea what I saw, but I will always remember it.;26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388
Brownish silent triangular object gliding across the sky at  05:30 in Lake Worth Florida 09/21/2006;2006-09-21 05:30:00;1 second;Brownish silent triangular object gliding across the sky at  05:30 in Lake Worth Florida 09/21/2006 WOW! I took the dogs outside and noticed the back of a brownish shape slowly passing south behind the 2 story apartment building next to me. I imagine it was a triangle. The back was more or less straight across and tapered forward. It was gliding silenly across the sky. I saw no lights and dropped everything and  ran 25 feet into the street to see more but it was gone. Then drove the car south but could not find it. The building is low so it seemed to be maybe the altitude that a helicopter flys in the city. I have never seen anything like it or any where close to the shape and color before. An amazing experience. I will pursue my quest to identify it.;26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388
Triangle with lighted sides, no sound. Lake Worth, FL 11/03/07 08:40pm;2007-11-03 19:40:00;30 seconds;Triangle with lighted sides, no sound. Lake Worth, FL 11/03/07 08:40pm A Triangular craft moved from the North West towards the East South East. It was clearly visible due to some low cloud cover. The craft was clearly lit on both angle's of each side of the left and right side, with individual lights such as an illuminated orb, approximatly 6 to 8 on each side. The inside of the craft also blocked out the background of the stars that were visible. Another noticable thing was there was no sound. I have lived in this house for over 17 years and the airport to the West, North West, I have seen many aircraft, and helicopters, this was no craft made by man, or if so it was truly military.

I couldn't tell how high it was nor how big.  I was amazed by what I had just seen.  It wasn't bright at all.  Almost like a darken out red.  The front had one dark red faint light followed by two in the back.  It was going extremely fast heading north east.  Amazing.;26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388
3 bright orange triangles slowly moved across the sky in a triangle formation, then the light emitting from each faded 1 by 1.;2013-09-14 04:00:00;3 minutes;3 bright orange triangles slowly moved across the sky in a triangle formation, then the light emitting from each faded 1 by 1. As I arrived to my friend's house to drop her off, I stepped out of my car to let her out of the backseat.  After starting to say goodbye, I looked up to the sky and noticed what were certainly not stars, nor common aircraft.  I was amazed to see three, orangish-red, glowing triangles, flying in a triangular formation.  Their speed seemed to be comparable to that of typical jets, however, there was absolutely no sound to be heard from this spectacle.  They were in the northwestern sky, flying from west to east.  I observed this for about two minutes, when then the light emitted from each source seemed to flicker slightly, then fade out - the front one first, then another, then the last one, until I saw them no more.  I was incredibly excited and overwhelmed with curiosity after viewing this incredible and unexplainable sight.;26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388
Self illuminated dull-amber color boomerang flying sporadically;2014-11-11 04:30:00;15 seconds;Self illuminated dull-amber color boomerang flying sporadically As my eyes were still adjusting to morning's darkness, I witnessed a dull yet fully illuminated amber-colored object over head maybe,  700 feet above. It appeared to be undulating.  Flying east to west.  My immediate impression was it felt/looked unnatural/foreign. It wasn't a meteor because it didn't fly in a straight line.  A little sporadic-like.  Very odd object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388

Size (estimated):  size of a football field, or larger.  No sound.  No Sonic Boom.  Heading North coming from the South.  It Headed North for 10 seconds then barrell rolled and spun to the left in the West Direction.  When it did this I was able to see that to was more of a Pyramid Shape with lights all around but the lights were not that bright, there was a section of lights across the middle also. I've been in the Aviation industry for 30 years.  This was not a conventional Aircraft, we have nothing that can move at those angles at that high speed.  It was absolutely Amazing to see.  Magnificent.;26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388
