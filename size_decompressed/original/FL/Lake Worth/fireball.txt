South florida fireball/ orb changes color, blends in with stars;2012-02-03 18:00:00;5- 10 minutes;south florida fireball/ orb changes color, blends in with stars we used to live in Lake Worth florida, (small downtown area in so fla) in a small high rise (6 stories) looking north towards the city of west palm beach, we were the hightest thing from Lake Worth to the city so we had an amazing view. we lived there for over 3 years and would constantly look north to the city lights. PBIA is also visible and we would see the planes coming in and out, after 3 years we would notice if flight patterns would change etc.  On the evening of February 3rd 2012, I was in the kitchen (which looks directly out towards the big patio window) when I saw a HUGE orange orb fireball object heading south. There was no sound, in fact, you can see on my video how loud the music and everything was but planes regularly would drown out all the downtown noise. Given how many people were in the bars and on the street I couldnt believe I was the only one to see it. By the time I was able to get my phone to record, I had been observing the object for about a minute. The fireball/ orb got first was growing in size as it approached us then got smaller as it headed south, at one point I tried to rationalize it by thinking it was a natural occurrence but the sky was clear and there werent any storms or electricity in the air. In the video you can see it start to ascend and then almost disappear. It never fully went away, i was tracking it the whole time but seemed to change and blend in with the night sky. I even ques! tioned the object at one point bc it looked like a far off shuttle launch (being from so fla we can occasionally see a night launch) it eventually gained speed and began to glow brighter again. after where my video cuts off  the object continued to head up and ascend till it was parallel and blended in with the stars, at which point it hovered and changed color to match the stars (a sort of blueish color) After another 5 min of observing it in the same position i headed back in.  The video captured was with my iphone that was almost dead and completely full of data at the time. so when i went to stop the video my phone was off and after I rebooted it, the video was not stored. I was pretty upset that it didnt work but about 2 days later, the video showed up in my queue (but at only a fraction of the recording was actually saved);26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388
Red Fireball sited in the sky, witnessed by 8 on New Years Day;2013-01-01 08:00:00;90 seconds;Red Fireball sited in the sky, witnessed by 8 on New Years Day On 1/1/2013 I went to a friends house in Lake Worth, Florida (Palm Beach County). We were all in her backyard when I noticed a firework going up into the air.  Fireworks had been going off since New Years Eve, so I didn't think nothing of it until my friends husband called it to her attention. I then really notice how slow the fireball was moving and how it never exploded into a firework.  The fireball never made any noise.  About 8 of us watched the small red/orange fireball continue to slowly float up into the sky until it got to the clouds, it then shifted course and began going North until it disappeared into the clouds or just disappeared.  It definitely appeared to be a fireball,  I thought it was a firework at first, it moved very slowly almost carefully.  The other witnesses were my friends family and my boyfriend. None of us have have any background in science or government, just normal American working class.;26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388
