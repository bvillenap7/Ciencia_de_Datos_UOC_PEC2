I see 3 Orange Orbs in a triangular formation;2003-09-09 12:23:00;30-50 Seconds;Driving normally and i look up in the sky, I see 3 Orange Orbs in a triangular formation. Each one with the same dark orange color glow. As i stopped and stepped out of the vehicle it went behind a tree ( palm tree if i remember correctly ) and only the UFO making the point of the trangle emerged, And after a few seconds the last UFO dissapeared, I heard no noise comin from these UFO's, And no flashing lights. It was pretty low to the ground, so low that if it was a plane you would definatly see flashing lights of some kind, I cant really explain the size unfortunatly, I saw it heading from East To South.;26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388
((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD));2007-12-10 19:00:00;5 minutes;My brother and I were out walking between 17:30 and 19:15 EST in our neighborhood.  We were walking east along a sidewalk at approximately 5 minutes to 19:00 and saw what we presumed was the comet that was in the news that was supposed to be very bright.  It was not until 01:00 est that we heard the report on Coast To Coast AM that what we saw was seen everywhere and was not a comet.  We were walking east and the object was about as bright as a large defined star in the sky with a cloud surrrounding it.  The cloud had the appearance of being slightly leading the star point in the front facing west, but the cloud mostly trailed to the east as if the object were traveling due west.  As I am very familiar with my position on the ground, I am positive this is the direction aspect in which the object was traveling although it did not look as though it were moving as it must have been at such a height, so as movement was undetectible without careful constant observation.  I am also familiar with NASA launches and this did not originate nor was it anywhere near the direction of Cape Canaveral.  It was not a conventional aircraft either as I am very familiar all types of commercial aircraft and most military aircraft.

silver disc in the sky;2008-05-31 14:00:00;2 minutes;silver disc in the sky I was driving down hwy 441, and noticed in the distant skyline above the trees a silver object at first I thought it was a plane landing but it was not moving fast enough and moved back and forth.  I can not tell how far away it was because it looked extremely thin. It was high in the sky, about where you would expect to see an airplane. It looked like a silver disc,  is it possible someone was playing a hoax with some kind of flying silver disc. yes.  I definetly think it applies to the 'unidentified flying object' as opposed to an alien spacecraft, I wrote this to mainly add credence to any other claim you might have recieved for a ufo in that area at that time by someone else. I only saw it briefly and I was the only one in the car at the time.;26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388
The obj. was shaped like the Space Shuttle or fighter jet.  Object had a red glowing round plasma like obj. ((anonymous report));2016-05-15 02:00:00;3 minutes;The object was shaped like the Space Shuttle or fighter jet in a way.  The object had a red gloving round plasma like object on the front tip of the triangle shaped ship.  The glowing red seemed like a energy field.   The object was low flying and slow moving almost seemed to hover.  The front had a cockpit in front with smoked windows.  Brown strip going down length of object.  No windows on side other than cockpit.  Object seemed like it would only fit one person.   Bottom of the object had no markings or cut out for landing gear.  The bottom only glowed white.  The object make a very loud noise, but not the noise of a jet. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I saw an object moving west at a relatively slow pace at an approximate altitude of 1500 ft. It seemed to be rotating and the sun was reflecting off of it.  I watched the object for about 1 to 1.5 minutes before I decided to grab some binoculars to get a better look.  I reacquired the object looking  through the binoculars and could see that it was an orangish color and was definitely rotating at a steady slow pace.  It seemed to be shaped like a parachute canopy.  I watched it through the binoculars for about 1 min before I lost sight of it due to a tree line behind my home.  I'm a professional pilot with 15 years experience and It was definitely not an airplane or helicopter.  Oddly enough as I decided to document the sighting a police helicopter showed up in the exact same area and flew around for some time at a higher than normal altitude.;26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388
