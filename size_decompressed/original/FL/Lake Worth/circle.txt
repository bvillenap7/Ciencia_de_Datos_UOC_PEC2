A bright colored light flew across the sky faster then any object we had ever seen.;2008-02-25 20:30:00;1 hour;A bright colored light flew across the sky faster then any object we had ever seen. I stepped outside to have a smoke when in the corner of my eye I saw a bright red light progressing slowly across the sky. I turned to look and said to my father, who was right in front of me, “look at that.”  At that moment the light turned green and sped up to an incredible speed.  Right before it disappeared behind the house it turned bright white. When we saw it moving across the sky it left streaks of the colors it changed in it’s wake. We ran outside to the spot where we thought it might have landed.  In the spot that it appeared to move to. We saw what could have been a star, but it was far below all of the other stars and it was blinking several colors. In no apparent order it would turn red, green, blue and white. We watched for approximately an hour and it would move slightly in random directions. My father is a fairly serious individual and would usually cast off such things. However upon seeing this he was thoroughly spooked as was I. Neither him nor I would normally be so intrigued by such a thing, but upon seeing this neither of us could stop looking. We most definitely saw something inhuman because the object was moving far faster than any human flying aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have observed a meteor, and then focussed on the star, Sirius.  Just a guess, given that our experience suggests that a genuine UFO probably would not hover in the sky for an hour.  PD));26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388
Two circles of light  with orange glow over West Palm Beach Fl.;2009-02-03 19:30:00;2-3 sec;Two circles of light  with orange glow over West Palm Beach Fl. Two circles of light surrounded by orange glow approched at high speed from NNE heading SSW.  Traveled in straight line then darded 90 degrees in lateral steps 3-4 times then travled straight then darted again.  At one point one darted to right and the other to the left.  They were well within air traffic altitude. I have a history of military training in aircraft identification and have never seen objects such as this. Also noted no sound associated with event, however background noise was present. The rate of speed could have been supersonic as the distance traveled in the short time was great. No trail or exhaust noted.;26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388
Very High Slow Moving Object;2009-08-29 18:00:00;5 minutes;Very High Slow Moving Object As high as the clouds were (I'd guess at least 10,000 feet) a slow moving black object was flying by. Too high to be a bird. Too slow to be a plane. Too low to be a satellite. Went to grab binoculars but misplaced object or it went into a cloud. Very strange and very out of place.;26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388

It was a circular object with a Orange hue that went up Vertical  from its original position and phased out only to become invisible.;2017-05-13 04:59:00;4 minutes;It was a Cicular object with a Orange hue that went up Vertical  from its original position and phased out only to become invisible. I awoke to use my bathroom early in the morning.  Looking outside my window, facing due East.  I noticed a light in the Sky.  It was extremely bright and had a orange hue to it.  I couldn't take my eyes off of the object.  I thought about grabbing my cell phone and taking a picture of it, however I couldn't believe what I was witnessing.  I was astonished and blown away.  The event lasted for about 4 minutes.  I regret not getting my phone and capturing video of it.   It was circular in shape.  It slowly appeared to be rising futher up toward the Sky.  I noticed it because of the electric power lines were also in my line of sight. Eventually, It phased out and disappeared into the Sky.  It was a Awesome Experience!  About a minute later, I called the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office and asked did anyone else report a light in the Eastern Sky.  The dispatcher said, No not yet.   The Dispatcher asked if I wanted a Deputy to talk with.  I said no.  Then she asked for my contact info, which I was hesitant at first.  However, I gave it to her.  About 20 minutes later, I decided to call the Palm Beach County Air Traffic Control.  I left a voice mail with my name and number.  I explained what I saw and asked if there were any Air Craft in Lake Worth at the time of the incident.  I did say that, I saw a craft phase out.  I didn't go into great detail.  I kept it simple.  Just the facts only.;26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388
