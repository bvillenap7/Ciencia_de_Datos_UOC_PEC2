It had red lights on it( 7 ). as i reached down to get my video camra i got to see the last glimps of it turn to a firey color and shoot away at an amasing speed.

ufo between clouds;2009-04-09 20:13:00;2 minutes;ufo between clouds 4/9/09 8.12 pm I went out to the parking lot   Look at the stars I looked sw then I turn right, and when I look to the north a blog transparent and camouflaged for the blue tone of the sky was moving very slowly.  Extending my arm the UFO was the size of my hand. It was oval and long, wider in the center.  The UFO kept going from the north to south and then made a very soft turn south, then turned to the west and disappeared. I went out at 8.30 and I saw the same shape coming from the sw and made a left turn, went north and then a left turn west and disappeared, all what I can see is the shape and the borders blending with the sky.  It was a blue sky with a kind of fog and the shape was between the upper and lower part of the cloud;26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388
