I captured pics of it. I was walkingto the store to get a pack of smokes, the store being just at the end of my block.  Tonight there was a full moon, and a beautiful night in south florida.  While walking along - I looked up at the moon which was bright and full, and there was another lit object moving along next to it - it first moved towards the moon, and then away from it, heading away from me and to the north.  after a while it faded out of site.  I always have a digicam with me (I run a webcam site and always keep a small cam in a hip-pouch thingy in case I see cool stuff to post on the site) so I fired off a few pics of it before it drifted off.  Im SURE that anybody in the whole city that was awake and looking would have seen it, it was HUGE.  I never heard any noises, as it was very far away, like miles away.  I have the images on my website that i snapped if you want to see them, they are at - http://((URL deleted)).html    The bright object to the left is the full moon, the smaller object in the right of the photo's is the UFO.  please feel free to contact me for more info.;26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388
