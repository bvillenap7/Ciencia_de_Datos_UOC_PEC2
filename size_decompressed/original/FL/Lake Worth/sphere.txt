I was facing west and noticed a very bright white light (spherical in shape) being emitted from a cluster of cumulus clouds approimately 30 degrees above the horizon.  The clouds moved away and I had a clear and unobstructed view of a large sationary sphere shapped object in the sky. I's relative position was 270 degrees and approximately 15nm west of my location.  This object maintained its altitude (approxiamtely 1,000 ft) for about 3 minutes when it it suddenly initiated a vertical climb at a speed that I estimate at mach 7 or higher. The craft's climbout only lasted two or three seconds.  Whatever this craft may be, or wherever it came from I strongly suspect that it isn't an airbreather.  I have been skeptical of most UFO reports until now.  What I witnessed 30 minutes ago is my first UFO sighting and I do admit that I am frightened by the prospect that our airspace is being violated but by what?
