Ball of Fire  turns to Cigar - shaped craft;1977-06-17 23:15:00;15 min.;Ball of Fire  turns to Cigar - shaped craft Ball of Fire turns to Cigar shaped UFO  While driving north on Lawrence Road to Lantana Road on the evening of June 17, 1977, the driver noticed a red  Ball  flickering above the treetops, about a quarter mile away to the north.  The car was stopped at an intersection and the 2 adult occupants got out and stood in the roadway in front of the car and watched the ball  for a min. or so.  Not knowing exactly what it was , the car zoomed to Lantana road and went east . The other adult passenger and child watched as the Ball  also turned east and then became a  Cigar,  huge, at least the length of a football field, with some red fire or smoking glow.  It also had portholes.  As the car advanced in speed, the craft flew up & out to the east, over the ocean until it was out of site, at a rapid speed . All 3 of the witnesses had never seen such a display and are worthy citizens. Personally, as one of the witnesses, I could not sleep that night, or for a few nights afterward and told my wife who scoffed at me about it.  But the other witnesses also had sleep problems for a while and have sworn to the truth of what we saw that night .;26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388
Dull yellow cigar shaped object silently flashed into sky, flew for a few seconds and then disappeared.;2011-07-15 21:05:00;3 seconds;Dull yellow cigar shaped object silently flashed into sky, flew for a few seconds and then disappeared. I was jogging back to my house and ran out of breath, so I started to walk.  While walking I looked up at the sky because there was a helicopter blinking.  After a couple of seconds a light flashed in the sky, a good distance west of the helicopter.  Originating from the small flash, a cigar shaped object started to dart across the sky much faster than the helicopter.  It glowed a dull yellow color, almost a grayish yellow.  It also looked as though part of the midsection was missing or transparent.  It flew very smoothly and quickly through the sky for about two or three seconds before vanishing before my eyes.  This all occurred silently, the object made no sound at all.  I have never seen one of these before, so naturally it was quite exhilarating.  The adrenaline rush gave me the energy to run back home where I told my family, then continued to look for somewhere to report it to see if other people in my area also witnessed it.;26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388
