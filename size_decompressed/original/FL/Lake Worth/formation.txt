Multiple witnesses to multiple objects;2002-03-16 22:00:00;45-60 Seconds;Multiple witnesses to multiple objects I was standing outside on March 16, 2002 at approximately 10:00 P.M. eastern standard time, when I saw a dim orangish light moving parallel to the horizon. After watching it a few seconds, I noticed another similar object trailing it. The second object began behaving erratically, (closing in, moving next to, dropping back). I noticed a commercial airliner on it's normal flight path moving south. These two objects appeared as if they were moving towards the airliner. Then they suddenly banked hard to the northwest changed direction suddenly and where back in front of the plane at a higher elevation. Then I called to my girlfriend to come see, just as she was getting there, multiple objects started appearing. When we lost track of them we suddenly noticed more than 20. They seemed to form a vertical circle or ball, then moved into a formation and proceeded south along the coast. During the formation or ball we called our neighbors out to see. They witnessed this as well as the formation which moved to the south. The whole event lasted approximately 45 seconds to one minute. Approximately 45 minutes later I spotted about 15 of these objects in a semi-circlar formation moving north. This time I called my girlfriend and 13 year old daughter who did not witness the first event to come see. We watched them for approximately 15 seconds move to the northwest and disappear rapidly. This time they appeared to be lower and further inland, which put them almost directly over-head. This formation  passed over without a sound.;26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388
Multiple formations viewed by three witnesses.;2004-10-11 23:00:00;2 hours;Multiple formations viewed by three witnesses It was exactly 11:00pm,(EST) I took my dog outside.I have a run we tie him to,I had just hooked him up when I glanced up and saw a formation of approximately 12-15 crafts moving South at a rapid rate of speed.This formation passed directly overhead without a sound.This is the second time I have witnessed such an event.The first time was March 16, 2003.I have told all my friends and family and they were all a bit skeptical to say the least!This time I came inside after watching them move South for about 20 seconds,until they went out of view.I grabbed my video camera to try to get some proof of these events.I was outside with it,trying to see if it would film the night sky.Unfortunately it didn't seem to work, my sister and law happened to come outside for a smoke and asked me what I was doing.I told her I had seen the objects again, and was trying to film them.She finished her smoke and went in.A few minutes later I saw 2 more of the objects moving South at a very high rate of speed.I knocked on her door to come see,my brother in law answered the door and I hurried him out to see.He had heard about my last sighting and was very skeptical,I was glad he saw them! This really peaked his interest, so we stayed out for a while to see if there would be anymore of them.By now it is approximately 12:00-12:15.He spotted a formation of at least 30 of these craft,hard to determine number because so many and moving in a wave like formation.After this formation passed us silently moving Southeast, we noticed from the backside they didn't appear as bright.This formation moved in a wavelike pattern at a pretty good rate of speed.We noticed after about 15 seconds it blended in with some wispy clouds in the area.I stayed out for about another half an hour,but didn't see any more.;26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388
Fiery orange object splits into 3 silver objects.;2013-12-03 17:44:00;4-5 minutes;Fiery orange object splits into 3 silver objects. While traveling north on Jog Road approaching the intersection of Hypoluxo Road in Lake Worth, FL (Lat 26°34'20.34N and Long 80°8'45.82W), my wife and I noticed an object high in the sky traveling southeast.   The object turned fiery orange for approximately 10-15 seconds.  It then split up into three distinct objects of different sizes and began to leave a thick contrail.   The objects were shiny silver in color.  Each of the objects created a vapor cone in front of them as they continued to move slowly across the sky.  We were able to video record the latter part of the incident on my wife's cell phone.;26.6057514195583;-80.125452681388
