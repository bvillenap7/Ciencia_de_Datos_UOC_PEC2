A strange moving light in the sky.;2001-01-22 22:22:00;hovering;A strange moving light in the sky. At first I thought it was the planet Venus.  A very bright light from the sky.  Then it started moving forwards and backwards and it seemed to be getting closer.  It went back to the exact position it was before, and then it faded away.  I couldn't tell the exact shape because of the light it had.  It was small, mabye a diamond.  It didn't look like a blimp because my mother said so.  It seemed to far up in the sky to be a blimp or an airplane anyways.  It couldn't have been a helicopter or a jet because of the light it had.  It looked like a star or planet.;30.2337;-85.6421
Platinum colored disk hovering silently above houses just across the street.;2007-02-12 17:00:00;fifteen seconds;Platinum colored disk hovering silently above houses just across the street. I was outside in our yard when I happened to look up (toward the north) and see an object hovering just above the roofline of the house across the street. The closest color to explain what I saw was palladium or platinum color.  It was shaped like looking at a saucer sideways with the edges just barely turned down and a small raised bubble on top. I thought to myself how pretty the sun was reflecting off that plane when I realized that as close as the object was and it wasn't moving, there should have been noise if it was an airplane. There was no noise, it was completely silent. I kept watching it hover and when I ran in to get the camera, it was gone when I got back outside.;30.2337;-85.6421
7 Witness a U.F.O;2007-05-23 15:00:00;15 seconds;7 Witness a U.F.O As me and my family were traveling back home from a beach condo, we started to cross the Bailey Bridge in Lynn Haven. We had just got on as my father(who was driving) Noticed something in the sky. He pulled over and jumped out, ordering us to come out and see. As I got out I noticed two other cars had already pulled over. Suddenly my little brother pointed to the sky and i looked up. I saw a disk shaped object fairly close to the bridge with approximately eleven lights on the bottom, one giant light in the middle. The object seemed to be a metallic blue, containing a 3-d outer trim on the edges. A I stand in awe, It slowly ascends and and quickly zooms away.;30.2337;-85.6421
