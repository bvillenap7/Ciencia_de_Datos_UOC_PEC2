Brilliant lightts with a haze;2003-11-19 17:15:00;10 minutes;Brilliant lightts with a haze On a walk with my dogs in a rural area of Lake county on a clear day with no clouds in sight I looked to the east and saw a cluster of ten lights of blue, red, green and white... the most brilliant lights I had ever seen.  These lights were surrounded by a pink/red haze that seemed to emanate from the bottom and flow upward around the lights. This object was no more than 30 feet off the ground and approximately 300 feet in front of me.  It was thirty to forty feet wide and made no sound what so ever. It hovered or seemed to float for a few minutes until it fired off a smaller white light to the west/southwest not two feet above the pine trees to my immediate right.  At this point I started home across our pasture to get my husband to see what I saw.  As I moved towards the house the object followed.  By the time I got my husband to come and see the object, it was directly over the house and we both watched it ascend until it disappeared in the sky above us.;28.8856701030928;-81.5985113402061
