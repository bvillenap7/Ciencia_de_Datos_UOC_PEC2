UFO spotted in Eustis, Fl.;2015-04-01 22:00:00;~30 minutes??;UFO spotted in Eustis Fl We live in the rural area east of Eustis, Fl.  The stars were out and I spotted a line of lights toward the west just above the tree line from my window it looked to be a mile or so away from me just south of the ocala forest close to Lake Norris.  Im not sure of the angle  Im guessing 33 degrees, but it was not a helicoptor or airplane.  It was just hovering in one spot for about 30 minutes then the clouds got in my view but it was still there. I did not watch any longer and my husband was going to sleep so he would not get up to see it. the next thing I heard was him snoring.  I have seen lights above the Black Water Creek on Lake Norris road before but it has been about 20 years ago or more.  I was riding in a car going over the creek and looked up and saw lights like a huge airplane just hovering over the creek and bridge.  It was massive but could not really believe my eyes an figured I was seeing things.;28.8856701030928;-81.5985113402061
