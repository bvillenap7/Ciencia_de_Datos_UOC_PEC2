Blue triangle lights over Eustis, FL.;2014-12-01 01:30:00;5 minutes;Blue triangle lights over Eustis, FL. It was about 1:30 am i got up to get drink of water and use restroom, I glanced out window saw like a blueish pulsating light, at first thought maybe law enforcement had someone pulled over or something, but I looked out window and saw the glow was coming from above.   As i looked up, I could see 3 triangle crafts, almost as if it was translucent, almost like seeing through it.  The light was flashing on things in yard like the orange tree, then flashed the oak, like they were looking for something.   I was frightened by what I saw, and it appeared that when they saw me moving curtain to see, they went straight up and disappeared.;28.8856701030928;-81.5985113402061
