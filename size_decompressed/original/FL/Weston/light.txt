V-formation lights over Naples area.;2015-09-02 23:01:00;4 minutes;V formation lights over Naples area I walked out onto my deck, which faces West - towards Naplesâ€¦ I am right off of Alligator Alley...and saw 5 lights in the distance in a V formation...spaced apart, rising upwards, as if planes taking off.  The odd thing is that this area is not in a flight path, not that I know of, and I never see planes take off from this direction.  If anything, planes move across the sky, but do not take off from this area.  They moved in the V formation towards the South until they were out of sight. Hard to see details, as they could have been planes.  They looked evenly spaced apart - as when taking off from an airport. Also, earlier that night, several low flying, large, heavy duty helicopters, possibly military, were heard going overhead from the South to the North for about 15 minutes around 9 pm.;26.1021947368421;-80.3970421052631
