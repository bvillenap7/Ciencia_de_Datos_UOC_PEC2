Orange fireball in the north sky;2012-01-03 20:25:00;1-2 minutes;Orange fireball in the north sky Looking towards the North sky, I noticed a flickering orange fireball in the sky moving very slowly towards the East, moving lower as it moved along. A smaller part of the object dropped directly below it and then the larger object continued moving slowly but appeared to be getting smaller and smaller and eventually disappeared. The event lasted all of about 2 minutes (from me first spotting the object).;26.1021947368421;-80.3970421052631
Amazing light show, with no answers!;2012-11-05 01:24:00;20 minutes;Amazing light show, with no answers! While exiting I75 onto 595 around the time of 1:20 am in weston florida. I experienced 6 orange glowing orbs that seem to have taken off from a tree line and accending toward and past the moon.No sound radiating and the movement of the objects seem to be controlled. This is strange. I cannot rationalize what i witnessed ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));26.1021947368421;-80.3970421052631

I stopped by the side of the road to take pictures. They slowly just disapeared into the thin air, and then a 9th one came and it also shortly just disapeared.

The plane had just turned on the base leg ready to turn on final approach for runway L 090 at FLL airport.   The object was probably over the Atlantic as the airport is just off the coast line in Fort Lauderdale.   The picture I took just fraction of a second before this one did not shown an image or contrail approaching from the East.  The camera I used was a Coolpix 3.0 LCD.   I talked to Broward County Sheriffs office command center at the airport/seaport on the 12th.  Their reaction-not in our domain-no recommendation where to go.  Thank you for coming by.   The object could have been exactly overhead their office when I took the picture. Thanks-- ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));26.1021947368421;-80.3970421052631
We saw two bright  fireballs in the sky, which later disappeared very quickly.  ((anonymous report));2016-07-03 22:35:00;15 seconds;We saw two bright  fireballs in the sky, which later disappeared very quickly. We were driving on Bonaventure Blvd on the intersection Griffin when we saw two bright sphere-like orange red fireballs. They were about 300 ft in the air and about 500 ft behind the traffic lights.  They also seemed proportionately large compared to traffic lights,probably 15 ft in diameter.  They were about two-three times brighter than a traffic light, and both emitted a haze of light around (that's how bright they were).  If I remember correctly, I made out some (maybe 3?) elliptical shaped ovals under the bright light on the left, not sure about the one on the right..  We were facing south and made a turn facing east. We noticed them as we were approaching the intersection at a red light but we quickly made a left turn(east) as it turned green in about 5 seconds.  After the turn I looked back up to see the UFO's however they were no longer visible and disappeared.  I did not see them disappear, but rather after the turn checked to see nothing there.
