Bright sphere over Weston FL;2009-05-02 22:00:00;2 hours;Bright sphere over Weston FL For the last 3 days my husband and I have noticed a small stationary bright sphere in the sky above Weston Florida. Although it is more visible at night, we have also seen it early in the morning.  The sphere is a white bright light and has a smaller red flashing light.  At times, it splits into 2 orbs and then recomposes into the single orb. It seems too high to be a helicopter, blimp or a plane and it is not a planet.  The orb stays put at the same location for a long period of time and then moved a short distance west in a flash and again stayed at that location for a long period of time.;26.1021947368421;-80.3970421052631
Dancing UFO's;2011-04-26 13:44:00;2 minutes;Dancing UFO's Driving N bound on I-75 between Griffin Rd and Weston.  At first I thought it was a model airplane but then when I looked again, there were 3.  There were dancing around (like they were playing) and then I noticed one went into a 90 degree turn without stopping.  They were about the size of my truck (Saturn VEU) and aprox 1200 to 1400 feet.  I have seen this type before when I was on vacation in Costa Rica.  The item in question was over a small town and then I got pictures of it next to an active volcano. I will enail the pictures I obtained in Costa Rica.;26.1021947368421;-80.3970421052631
