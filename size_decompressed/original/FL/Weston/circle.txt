Then within 2 seconds all three vanished.;26.1021947368421;-80.3970421052631

On the video it appears like a tennis ball size round object protruding light hovering over a piece of branch that was cut earlier.  When the flood light motion detector comes on it disappears but watching the video again, it is still over the branch and moving around. It looks transparent and no light protruding from it.  I wanted to be reasonable and dismissed it as being a really large fly, may be ! About 2 weeks later we had a similar event on camera, this time looked like several balls of lights moving in a coordinated fashion!!!  The second event occurred on 11/14/2020 at 1:46 AM as per Ring camera;26.1021947368421;-80.3970421052631
