Huge low hovering craft with different rectange shapes on it.;1985-06-01 23:00:00;3-5 minutes;Huge low hovering craft with different rectange shapes on it. Sorry, I am in the process of getting a new computer and I can not type on Word.  My computer was badly corrupted.  I hope you can still accept this message from me. I want to comment on the Casselberry Florida sightings if I may.  I myself, my husband, my mother, and my Niece were at Dog Track Road and Hwy 17-92 at the red light about 11:00 sometime in the middle 1980's and we saw something very strange.  I myself heard a low hum and I said what is that sound?  My family and I looked up out from our windows and saw what appeard to us as a huge low hovering object that seemed to be the size of the car lot that was at the light.  I remember saying that looks like something off of Battlestar Galactica.  We all saw it.  It also seemed to have different colored  rectangle shpaes on the bottom of it which was the part we were looking up at from our car to the best of my memory.  Some of the rectangles were smaller than others.  I think I remember a Purple color. However, we have told ourselves over the years it was something we have made to much out of so it has been disregaurded, but has always been a memory that I would like to know if anyone else has ever seen anything like it before.  I saw the comments by someone on this sight that lives near a dog track in Casselberry, and I'm thinking it must be the Old Dog Track on Dog Track road in Casselberry.  The placement of their sightings and sounds near the palce we saw strange things has prompted me to e-mail this. I will make one last comment, I do remember being kind of scared and my husband said lets get out and see it closer and I remember saying, No, way!  I'm not getting out of this car.  We drove on throug the intersection when it was our turn to go and it appeard to be done.  If there were any other cars at that red light that night it couldn't have been very many since it was late at night. How do I know when someone could respond to my message?  I will try to get my Micrsoft Office to work for me.  Sorry, again! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));28.6591803921567;-81.3211701525062
Casselberry Florida 4th of July incident!!!!!!!!;2004-07-04 20:50:00;seconds;Casselberry Florida 4th of July incident!!!!!!!! On July 4th 2004 @ 8:30pm eastern standard time. A friend of mine told me that while her and her neighbors were outside lighting fireworks, there was a loud explosion. Within seconds of the impact the sky was illuminated. She also claims that once it hit all the windows and car alarms were set off and they were momentarily blinded. Everyone in the neighborhood was scared and went back to thier homes to find out what was going on. They turned on the t.v. and radio waited and to their suprise there was no news about what just had occured. Two days later people were calling in radio station to find out if anyone else had seen or heard what was going on. The people from the radio station Real Radio 104.1 actually sent someone to investigate. They went to the location where people reported seeing and hearing the object fall from the sky. The military was there and so was Nasa. They also fenced up the hole that was in the ground . They also reported seeing Military Hummer going in and out.To my knowledge no reporter from newspapers or television have come to the site.  I personaly went by there and I dont know if what I saw had been there before but I saw 3 satelites right next to where the impact took place. there are other witnesses.;28.6591803921567;-81.3211701525062
Orbs that were golden-rod/orange in color;2013-04-06 20:00:00;5 minutes;Saturday, March 6th, 2013 around 7:45 – 8:00 p.m. – Casselberry, FL  Traveling in car with friend in residential neighborhood, I observed 2 clusters of at least 5-6 suspended orbs that were golden-rod/orange in color.  They were in close proximity to each other in the N. Eastern sky and just a short distance over the tree line.  When I saw the first group, I pointed them out to my friend and our initial thoughts were that they were planes, but concluded they were much too close to each other and the lights were not those of planes.  Then we thought they might be helicopters, but again, they did not resemble helicopters….the orbs were amber glows!   As my friend acknowledged the first group while she was driving, I maneuvered to get a better look out of the back window and noticed yet another grouping of the same orbs!  We both were a gasp as to what the heck those things were and we then quickly started looking for a safe place to pull over to get a better look.  We thought for sure other people must have seen it too! Could they be drones?!   Before getting to a stopping point, we noticed that the number of orbs in the two groups had diminished leaving only one & two in the first group, and two and three in the second group.   While my friend fumbled in excitement to get pictures, the orbs continued to slowly fad away – one by one- and then they were gone.   There was no sound!  She did manage to get a few photos, but by that time, they were pretty much faded….we wished we would have recorded it, because now…who would believe us?!!;28.6591803921567;-81.3211701525062
