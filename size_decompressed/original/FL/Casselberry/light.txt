Large flash huge boom NASA vehicles everywhere;2004-07-04 23:00:00;3 Minutes;Large flash huge boom NASA vehicles everywhere On the 4th about 20 of us were outside lighting off fireworks. All of a sudden there was this immense flash of light that was blueish and puprleish that lit up the sky for at least 15 seconds. Following was a boom that was deafining...rumbleing for at least 30 seconds. The following tuesday at an abandoned dog track near my house there were FBI agents surrounding the area. The same followed on Wed. On thursday the FBI was gone but Black and white Hummers were all over the place With NASA written on the side of them. The weird thing is that no one has covered the explosin on the news or even said a word about it. Only one balsy DJ from a local radio station that lives near the site. >>>>>>>>>>>>I believe theyre hiding something  EVEN WEIRDER IS THE PICTURES TAKEN IN THE EXACT SAME LOCATION ON JULY 29, 1980 ARE IDENTICAL TO 100'S OF REPORTS ON THE SIGHTINGS.;28.6591803921567;-81.3211701525062
Hovering lights over Casselberry's former Greyhound track;2007-10-24 05:28:00;20min;Hovering lights over Casselberry's former Greyhound track This is the second time within the last week that the object has appeared.  When I first saw it, about twenty minutes into the event two helicopters flew near it.  The object appears to be several lights hovering 2,000ft above the ground and maybe a mile away.   I used high powered binoculars and wasn’t able to make out the outline of a craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Bright fast moving object flying parallel to the horizon;2014-12-13 21:00:00;30 seconds;Bright fast moving object flying parallel to the horizon I was on my porch looking out and a bright white object flew by.  I thought it must be a meteor, but it realized it was going parallel to the horizon.  It was steady, fast moving and silent and didn’t seem to be too high up. It wasn’t as high as a plane would be.  I ran out to try and get more of a look, but it disappeared into the tree line.;28.6591803921567;-81.3211701525062
3 very large bright orbs of light flying in a triangle formation were flying below the clouds on a rainy evening.;2016-05-16 21:00:00;4 minutes;3 very large bright orbs of light flying in a triangle formation were flying below the clouds on a rainy evening. Driving towards highway 17-92, there were three very bright lights in the sky.  The lights were a deep golden orange color. These were brighter and larger than the street lights.  These glowing orbs were hovering in the sky below the clouds.  I called my husband, a commercial pilot, to explain what I saw and he asked for a photo.  As I turned around and prepared to take a photo, they vanished. As I stated before, my husband is a pilot.  I've flown with him several times and spent many dates staring at the sky as he identified planes.  These orbs were spaced seemingly hundreds of miles a part.  They flew too low to be planes and were far too large to be drones.  It could not have been a satellite because these things hovered below the clouds.  I should also mention it was raining lightly so the clouds were very dense.;28.6591803921567;-81.3211701525062
