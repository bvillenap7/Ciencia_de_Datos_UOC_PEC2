02/16/20 Streak of red light lasting about 4 sec off the East coast of Big Pine Key FL at 9:06 PM;2020-02-16 21:06:00;4-5 seconds;02/16/20 Streak of red light lasting about 4 sec off the East coast of Big Pine Key FL at 9:06 PM On Sunday Feb 16, 2020, at about 9:06 we were looking South South East from the North end of Big Pine Key.  About 30* above the horizon  we saw a red streak of light which traveled Eastward lasting for about 4 seconds leaving a trail behind it.  I also saw flashing aircraft lights about 50* above horizon in the same part of the sky at that time.  I observed the aircraft lights for 3 minutes continuing West.  We are able to see Space X launches when conditions are right and the color and movement of the streak of light reminded me of those lunches but in a completely opposite location.  I don’t think the streak originated from the aircraft but I’m fairly confident the streak was clearly visible to persons on that aircraft because of their location.;24.6772;-81.3681
