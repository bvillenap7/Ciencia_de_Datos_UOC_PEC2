The space between the lights blocked out any stars in the night sky also giving me the impression that I was looking at a one object.  It was traveling at a high rate of speed, and disappeared suddenly.  Immediately after disappearing a shooting star streaked across the sky where craft disappeared at.  I am a 49 year old female married with one son and two step daughters, I have 2 grandchildren and 5 step grandchildren. I have been married to my second husband for 13 years and am a life long resident of South Florida.  I am retired d! ue to physical disabilities but am of sound mind.  I am a long time lover of history, astronomy, archeology.  I have always believed in life beyond our planet and am extremely excited to have been lucky enough to have witnessed what may have been a visiting craft from another world.;24.6772;-81.3681
