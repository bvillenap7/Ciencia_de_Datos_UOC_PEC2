A resident came to me 11/19 and said he filmed a ball of fire traveling slowly at high altitude toward horizon in southwesterly direction. He then filmed a second streaking silver ball that left a white contrail. The person who filmed this said he was pulling into the driveway, saw something dramatic in the sky, and grabbed his camera. It looked as broad as a thumb at arms length and left a bright fan-shaped tail. He said he also saw another bright object and when the first object went over the horizon, he turned the camera on the second. It looked more defined, like a shiny, metal spot (shape unknown) leading a white contrail. I'm a newspaper reporter. I will be writing a story more focused on the excitement of seeing something dramatic -- but the illumination of the sun could be playing tricks on contrails. To view the video, our newspaper (Charlotte Sun Herald) posted it on the Internet at www.sunline.net/ufo/ To comment, e-mail me at www.((address deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We have received several reports quite similar to this one, and they all seem to have been caused by contrails behind high-flying aircraft.  Depending on the position of the sun, some witnesses will report them as UFO's.));26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092
Fire/light ball in Florida night sky.;2013-01-17 20:15:00;3-5 seconds;Fire/light ball in Florida night sky I was driving down Rt. 41 in Port Charlotte, FL heading South last night when a fireball with a fire tail appeared in the sky above the traffic light 3 traffic lights down in the distance.  It appeared to have been falling, or moving in a fast, downward curved motion and then disappeared just above the traffic light.  It was rather large, so I did not think it was a shooting star, and it looked more yellow-white in color, much like a light bulb. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

The craft hovered, moved left to right, up and down.  No real fast movements...almost as if it was watching the fireworks displays going on all around town.  And no sound at all.   Sometimes the light/color would become a brighter red or orange.  The first object winked out towards the south while the second one stayed around for another minute before it to winked out towards the east.   My daughter who was about 4 miles away also video taped one of the objects in her neighborhood around 9:25 about 15 minutes prior to our video.  She has about two minutes of video but she said it was there hovering for around 4 minutes.  I have video from two different phones which one is better than the other.  But my daughters iphone video is really good.;26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092
