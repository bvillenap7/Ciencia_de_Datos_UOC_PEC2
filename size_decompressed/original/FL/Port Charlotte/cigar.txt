Incredibly fast moving craft with bright lights over Charlotte County, FL;2007-09-26 20:00:00;30 sec;Incredibly fast moving craft with bright lights over Charlotte County, FL I saw a cigar shaped object moving at an incredible rate of speed from east to west. I was traveling north on I-75 in Charlotte County, Florida.  I saw the object cross the highway about Â½ mile ahead.  At first I thought it was an Air Force fighter jet because of the speed. It had a whit light in the front and a green light in the back. If it was any kind of airplane then I should have seen a red navigational light since I was on its port side. The object raced across the sky then I lost sight. Twenty seconds later I was driving on an overpass and I saw the object make a sharp left turn and loop north.  As it made this maneuver it became 2 objects with bright white lights.  As I descended the overpass I lost sight again. The location was highway marker 175 on Interstate 75.  The time was 8 PM.;26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092
