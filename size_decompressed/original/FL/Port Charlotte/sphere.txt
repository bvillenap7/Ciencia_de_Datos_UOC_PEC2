Red sphere in SW Florida Sky.;2013-12-25 07:00:00;~1 minute;Red sphere in SW Florida Sky. On Christmas night 12-25-2013 around 7pm, observed a large red light with an orange aura around it.  Solid non blinking, traveled from the East headed in a South Western direction.   Went in a relatively straight line about helicopter flying height and speed, made no sound that I could hear.  The size of the light best that I could judge was the size of an average size helicopter in flight not to be confused with the light on a helicopter, the light was the size of the whole helicopter.;26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092
Bright reddish-orange sphere in southern night sky.;2013-12-25 20:50:00;35-40 second;Bright reddish-orange sphere in southern night sky. Port Charlotte, Florida December 25, 2013, @ 8:50 pm. My father and I were in the pool when we noticed a bright, reddish-orange sphere appear in the eastern sky.  It flew across the sky, from the east to west our pool area faces south and we were able to watch it as it crossed the night sky to the south of us.  It moved at a high rate of speed.   It was difficult to determine the altitude of the object, but it could not have been more than several thousand feet.  There were no flashing lights.  It made absolutely no noise.  It was a bright, illuminated, reddish-orange object and it flew on a level course.   During the 35-40 second sighting, our neighborâ€™s dog began barking (this could have been a response to our excited conversation during the sighting).;26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092
Bright red light drifting westward started to pulsate from dim to bright repeatedly;2017-07-04 21:50:00;2 minutes;Bright red light drifting westward started to pulsate from dim to bright repeatedly While neighbors were lighting off fireworks at 9:45-10:00 pm, I observed a red lighted object in the northern sky, from my screened porch at approx. 40 degrees above horizon in the far distance.  Much further below this light was another light that appeared more whitish, but I only got a glimpse of it.  I went in and retrieved my binoculars, when I returned, the lower light was out of sight, but I could see the red light very well.  The red light object was more ball-shaped with no other lights and was moving slowly westward, almost appeared to be drifting. I was nearly convinced it was a Chinese lantern, but after maybe a minute of observing it, the red light began to pulsate from dim to bright red, repeatedly.  When this started, the object seemed to moving along more quickly.   Trees in the distance began to block my view and I soon lost complete sight of it. I have found a video on youtube that matches it very well, titled UFO RED PULSATING OR BLINKING LIGHT FRESNO anyone see this sort of thing?;26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092
