Invisible 'V' sighting.;2015-03-15 22:30:00;3 minutes;Invisible 'V' sighting This event happened a few years ago, but I did not know this website existed at the time. There were actually 2 other events that proceeded this one which I will explain later.  I was out walking my dog on a bright starlit night with a few high level clouds.  I was stargazing when I noticed a visual distortion about 60 feet above me.  It was similar to a ripple in a smooth clear pond except it had a distinct 'V' shape leading edge.  It was transparent and I could see the clouds above it but no stars until the 'V' moved about 40 feet when they would reappear.  I concluded that would be the trailing edge.  The 'V' angle was about 135* and 100+ feet wingtip to wingtip moving around 5 mph due north.  At first I thought maybe it was an illusion so, I turned away and focused on the house next to me and then returned my gaze back to the 'V'.  It continued its northerly flight with no sound or lights until my dog and I lost sight of it behind the tree line.  Early the next evening, two A10 (??) military jets traveled the same south to north route at tree top level shaking everything in the house.   I called the police to find out what was going on but they said no else had reported the flyover and had no information.   Two weeks prior to this sighting, while again walking my dog about 1 hour before sunset, a stationary bright orangish globe was in the south sky at maybe 2000 to 3000 feet.  It started to move slowly west toward the setting sun.  After about 30 seconds it moved almost vertical at a blazing speed and was beyond sight within 3 seconds.  At the time, I thought it was probably an effect of the sun getting low on the horizon.  But, the color was very different and somewhat similar to a sodium-vapor lamp.  Two days later, my wife and I were eating an early dinner around 4 PM at a nearby restaurant.   We were sitting next to a west facing window and I started to described the strange orangish globe to her.  We both casually turned to l! ook out the window and there was the globe I was describing at! some di stance away moving east toward us.  It's speed was fast but not unusual and we lost sight of it behind some buildings.  No other sightings have occurred since then.;26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092
An object of triangular shape ~ the size of a 737 came across the sky roughly ½ mi. to our W.  ((NUFORC Note:  Aviator report.  PD));2018-04-16 22:30:00;7 seconds;On April 16th, 2018 at 10:35 in the evening, my wife and I were setting on our patio in Port Charlotte, Fl. We were looking for satellites as we often do to see which of us would win the game of seeing the most. Unexpectedly an object of Triangular Shape about the size of a 737 came across the sky roughly ½ mile to our west and approximately 1000 to 1500 feet and traveling very fast and silent. The craft made no noise on a clear and clam night as a front had recently come through. The craft showed no Navigation lights but had several “Puck” type lights under each wing. I believe there were about 6 or 7 that ran the entire length of the craft. The object transitioned the area in about 5 seconds and airliners doing the same distance to the local airport only slightly higher than what we saw take about 17 to 20 seconds.  The “Tail” of this object appeared blurry as though it maintained some type of distortion in that area. I am a former airline pilot and Naval Aviator and I consider myself somewhat educated on airplanes and their characteristics.  This gave both my wife and I “goose bumps.”   I reported this sighting to MUFON and they blew it off as a B-2.  I have seen many B-2’s over my time… many.  Their engines produce noise and the airframe has a similar but not the same geometry.  MUFON stated it was a B-2 on its way to MacDill.  I was a young Naval Aviator …21 years old and full of myself.  I would never have risked my career by running 1000 feet above a very populated area with no required navigation or landing lights.  MacDill is about 67 Miles to my North…. Running through this densely populated area with no lights other than these dim puck type lights under the wing would be a court martial offense in this day and age.  I think MUFON did not do a proper job in their analysis. I would be very interested in what you think.  Recently I was watching a program called Unacknowledged and at the 126 minute mark….. or close to it, they show a craft that is a very close approximation to what my wife and I saw.;26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092
Chevron shaped craft with mirrored exterior traveling from sw to new portion of sky 1000ft above ground. Completely silent.;2021-04-04 21:12:00;20 seconds;Chevron shaped craft with mirrored exterior traveling from sw to new portion of sky 1000ft above ground. Completely silent. It was a chevron shaped w craft spotted from 210 degrees departing 330 degrees low and fast showing no navigation lights, strobe lights, or identification lights of any kind. The object appeared smoky and mirror light perhaps reflecting star light or mirrored lights. It was traveling what we could guess about 600 mph with absolutely no sound. Really weird. Similar object seen from same location 3 years ago. Definitely not a b-2 bomber. Completely silent.;26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092
