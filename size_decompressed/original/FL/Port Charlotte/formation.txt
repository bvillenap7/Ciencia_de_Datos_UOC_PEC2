1/16/2001  Formation of 3 objects in souther sky over Florida.  Light beams, light bursts and seperation and departure.;2002-01-15 19:40:00;4-5 min;1/16/2001  Formation of 3 objects in souther sky over Florida.  Light beams, light bursts and seperation and departure. Traveling south on I-75 thru Port Charlotte, Fl. at 7:40pm.  In the sky south east of I-75 a formation consisting of three lights was apparent.  One light was extremely light and two other were less bright but of equal intensity.  A light beam came from the large object, radiating downward and moving back left to right once. The formation began to change showing distance growing between the bright object and the two lesser objects.  The two smaller still staying in same proximity of each other.  Then a star burst around one of the smaller was extremely evident.  Looking like a burst of energy and then the light became smaller until disappearing.  The second smaller light dropped further down then became smaller.  The large light became dimmer and then display another burst of light around it and grew smaller to the visable eye until disappearing. Many other witnessed this along I-75 were they had pulled over to watch the event unfold. What a great experience.;26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092
A bunch of pinprick lights quickly moved across the sky.;2013-12-04 19:30:00;15 seconds;A bunch of pinprick lights quickly moved across the sky On Dec 4, 2013 at approximately 7:30 pm I saw about 20 to 30 small pinpricks of light straight up in the sky.  The light of these was not as bright as the stars around them. They were in a bunch, and within seconds they all moved together from north to south and disappeared.  Three of us that were together all saw them. One of the people there was somewhat shaken.;26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092
I saw an echelon formation of five short horizontal white dimmed lights flying west to east at constant speed.  ((anonymous report));2019-04-02 05:30:00;15-20 seconds;I saw an echelon formation of five short horizontal white dimmed lights, flying west to east, at constant speed.  The lights didn't maintain perfect formation, but were still tightly close to each other. The velocity seemed fairly high as it took some 15-20 seconds for the formation to fly across the sky, which appeared substantially faster than conventional aircraft.  Nevertheless, in the night sky I couldn't estimate the altitude of the formation, so can't vouch for the velocity estimate either. There was a distant jet engine noise, but I was standing pretty close to the highway, so can't say for sure where the noise came from.
