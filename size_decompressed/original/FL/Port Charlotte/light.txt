Dim light increasing in brightness, Headed Northward in FLorida...;2006-05-04 20:30:00;2 min.;Dim light increasing in brightness, Headed Northward in FLorida... This event occured around 8:30 pm near my home in Florida.   I was saying good bye to a friend of mine and we walked outside and talked for a few minutes and I was just observing the passing planes and happened to look Northward.  A plane caught my eye (I could make out the blinking navigational lights) and then near it I saw a smaller light resembling a star.  I could not make out if it was moving or not until the strangest thing happened. The light appeared to increase in brightness almost instantly and accelerate northward quickly.   I pointed for my friend to see and he watched it with me as it grew increasing brighter, acclerated in speed and then definately moved north and then made a curve off to the left(westard) at steady turn(then moving NorthnorthWest) until we both could only see it with our peripheral vision before it finally dissappeared. The light was definately in a higher atmosphere, because I couldn't hear and noises and I could not make out navigational lights. It moved rather smoothly to the north on and performed it's turn with ease.  I've seen shooting stars and this was moving way too slow, even when it acclerated and the shooting stars I've seen don't just steady turn, they have a basic straight course.  It's possible it could have been the afterburner of a jet engine, but my friend as well as myself could see the light dim before it increased into the vanishing white ball.   Another thing I would like to add was that there was no pulsation to the light, at least from my stand point, in Florida on a perfect evening with the right line of vision you can see miles. There were several planes in the air that night to make comparison to and none were acting in the manner this light was acting.  After seeing it we both questioned ourselves because we've been out several nights fishing in the darkest of areas and ever seen anything like what we observed that night. ((NUFORC Note:  The ISS did not pass over Port Charlotte, FL, on this date, so is not a possible explanation for the event.  PD));26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092
bright lights catch my attention;2007-03-17 12:00:00;5 min;bright lights catch my attention fast moving lights that were not in a group and did not appear to be all moving the same speeds.  compared to watching planes travel the same distance of sky i would say that some of the objects moved 10 to 20 times quicker and the others at still incredible speeds.  they were bright lights and very high moving in the same general direction , south. Saw the first one which left me sitting there thinking what the hell did i just see when another appeared,  this all lasted about 5 or 6 min.;26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092
bright lights moving unlike a plane or helecopter;2007-09-26 20:30:00;20 seconds;bright lights moving unlike a plane or helecopter Port Charlotte, Fl    between 8 and 8:30 pm  While traveling north east at 25 MPH on Veterans Highway we observed 2 bright white lights at about the 10:00 position  at a little over tree top level. At first we thought they were helicopters search lights. They then turned towards us and arched around to about the 1:00 position. At this time they appeared to be the lights on the wings of a plane. I remember thinking the plane was going to land on the road. At about this same time a third white light appeared. I though it was the tail of the plane but was surprised not to see the flashing red lights of a plane. The lights then turned back towards the10:00 position and the 3 lights became 1. It disappeared off in the distance very quickly. The total time from sighting to it disappearing was 20 â€“ 30 seconds.  The lights were bright and did not blink, they were all white. The weather was clear with a few clouds and a full moon. The lights were not near the moon and we could not make out any object in the sky other than the lights.;26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092
Bright orange object moving slowly, stopped then dimmed out completely after a few seconds;2009-05-26 01:00:00;25 seconds;Bright orange object moving slowly, stopped then dimmed out completely after a few seconds At roughly 1:00 a.m. on May 26 I noticed a bright orange colored object in the western sky at approx. 45 degrees, moving slowly to the east in my general direction. At first I thought it was an approaching airplane but realized there were no flashing lights, just the same steady orange light, my next thought was it was possibly the international space station. After maybe 15 seconds the object seemed to be moving a bit slower then came to a complete stop in the sky at approx. 70 degrees. I could not hear any sound coming from it. I knew at this point I was observing something unusual and became excited. Then after maybe 5 to 10 seconds of it being in a stationary position the object then dimmed out in a what I can only describe as a controlled, steady manner, and I could no longer see it. Almost a day later I am still very excited over it. Conditions were completely clear while viewing it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Three orange lights seen by two adults over Port Charlotte.  3/16/15 at 23:40.;2015-03-16 23:40:00;4 minutes;Three orange lights seen by two adults over Port Charlotte.  3/16/15 at 23:40. UFO Sighting   Two objects that emitted an orange light flew at a low altitude from North to south past out home.  The first object moved across our line of vision and was followed by a second identical object.   The orange light on the first object flickered and went out before it left our line of vision. The second object was visible before the first orange light went out.  The second object followed the same flight path as the first and flickered and went out at the same spot.   About 30 seconds after the second orange light went out a third orange light appeared following the same flight path and traveled about the same speed.  The third object traveled across our line of vision and its orange light extinguished about the same spot as the other two.   Many aircraft over fly our area at night and they have  flashing lights, none of which are orange or as bright as the objects we are reporting.  The speed of the lights and the brightness of the lights were not the same as the aircraft lights we are used to seeing.;26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092
