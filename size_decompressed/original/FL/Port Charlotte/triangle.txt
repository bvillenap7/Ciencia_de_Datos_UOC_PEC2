Unfortunately, I did not report this event whet it happened, because I did now about this website, and also when I told the story to my coworkers, they suspected that I was under influence of drugs or alcohol. I swear I was absolutely sober.   That evening, I took my dog out.  Suddenly I felt something strange,  I can't explain, but similar to filling of some danger presence.  I look around and did not see anything unusual.  Then I looked up.  Right above me, a huge triangularly shaped object absolutely silently was moving South-North.  I've seen every small details of this huge object.  Object was made of gray colored metal.  If someone will contact me, I can describe it. I ran back to my house, called my 14 year old son and grabbed my video camera.  By that time the object disappeared.  My son was extremely disappointed, but suddenly the same object materialized in the sky, but now it was moving North to South direction.  I turned my camera on, but it looked like that battery was dead.  When we returned back home, and I checked, the battery was fully charged and camera was working normally.  I think that event like this one should be very exciting, but strangely, not me, not my son were excited.  It was like our emotions were suppressed, like we still remember it but kind of foggy. like someone does not want us to remember or to discuss it with anyone else.  I understand that this sound crazy, but I swear, it really happened to me and my son.  I don't use any drugs which could cause hallucinations, needles to say that my son was also absolutely sober.  I work for the government law enforcement agency and we are being tested regularly.;26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092
V or diamond shaped object, 100 to 200 feet up, stationary, then Southbound and vanished, LARGE, others on road taking pics.;2013-12-27 22:10:00;2-3 minutes;V or diamond shaped object, 100 to 200 feet up, stationary, then Southbound and vanished, LARGE, others on road taking pics Just saw very strange lights while driving on Chamberlain in NW Pt Charlotte.   I had just about made it to the junction of CORNELIUS and CHAMBERLAIN and saw a very large, low-Flying V-shaped object in the sky, with bright, orange-yellow lights on each end or point of the V or triangle. The object was stationary and huge in the sky.  When I spotted this object, I was on the phone with my father who lives close by.  I told him tO go outside and look. He saw the object and couldn't identify it either (and he was in the Airforce).  At first, this aircraft was completely still, and then it started moving Southbound.  I crossed Cornelius and stopped my car to get a pic, but it vanished.  One blinking light in the middle . . . I'd say no more than 100 or 200 feet up.  Anyone else see this?  I know there have been a spate of these sightings this year!  My brother saw something similar 12/23/2013!
