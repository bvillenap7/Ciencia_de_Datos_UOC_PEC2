silent ship close enough to hit with a rock(but i didn't);1998-12-16 23:33:00;approx.1-3min;silent ship close enough to hit with a rock(but i didn't) i was in my back yard w/my dog (german shepard) and when i looked up the stars were gone and then i noteced a ship about the size of a football field (at least)  in the middle was a section that came down (like a control station) serounding this section was what appeared to be windows(like on a comerical jet) but as the windows went toward the back they changed to yellow and then red. the ship was only about 40' above me and did not make a sound or even a breeze,my dog did not even notice it and my dog will bark if there is a person a block away. the ship appeared to be silver--there is wooded lots around my house,my house is on a corner. the ship begain to travel very slow to the east, i called my mother down the street when the ship started to move , i lost it in the trees(well it just disapeared) it took me about 45 min to an hour to call the local police(i am a retired new york city cop) then found out that a cop from Desoto county also saw it and said that on the map it came from my direction. there was about a second of it on the news and said it crashed into lake okeechobee and thats all it was talked about--someone called my house at about 0300-0400 sayin i should look out for a blue surburban(took it with a grain of salt) no one ever returned my calls. i also believe i have been abducted and looking back now i believe its been going on as long as i can remember. please get in touch and i will continue this conversation..

And it came to the middle and disappeared I saw a round shape UFO with red flashing lights on the bottom of it, the lights were framing the circle. Moving NE to SW across the sky.   It began to gain altitude, and it disappeared in the middle of the sky, right above where I was watching it.;26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092
Pulsating disk/saucer shape in Port Charlotte, FL.;2013-12-17 19:48:00;5 minutes;Pulsating disk/saucer shape in Port Charlotte FL I stepped out onto our back porch to smoke a cigarette and after sitting down I noticed a light in the distance.  At first I just thought it was a helicopter as we frequently have them flying around our area at night.   I watched for about a minute and realised the object was not moving and was kind of 'pulsating'.  I called my husband and a friend of ours outside to look at what I was seeing, where they pretty much disregarded it and then they both went back inside while I continued to watch the object.   About 5 minutes after I had noticed it, it seemed to disappear then it reappeared a little further 'south' where it disappeared behind a neighbors roof.;26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092
Large, discus shaped object silently hovering 60-70 ft AGL in front of my home.  Surface smooth, & glowing orange-white.;2016-05-27 23:50:00;20 seconds;Large, discus shaped object, silently hovering 60-70 ft AGL in front of my home.  Surface smooth, & glowing orange-white. I came out to close my garage door when I noticed an orange-white glow directly across the street from my house.  I stepped to the garage doorway and saw a discus-shaped object silently hovering about 60-70 feet AGL.  The object was approx 60 feet in diameter, and 20-25 feet thick from top to bottom, and the body occulted the star field and sky behind it.  The distance to where the object was hovering from my house was approx. 150 feet.  The front door of my house faces south (180 deg.). The glow was not very bright, and appeared to be radiating from the surface of the object.   There were NO other anti-collision or navigation type lights as required by the FAA.  The overall surface texture appeared to be smooth with no observable windows or excrescences, such as antennas, air intakes or engine cowlings. I immediately walked into the house to get a cell phone to shoot video.  I told my girlfriend about the object, as I went to the front door of the house.  The garage and front door are side by side.  I stepped through the door and re-acquired visual on the object, which had not moved.  As I lifted the phone to begin video, the object silently accelerated away to the SW, disappearing in 1.5 seconds.  There was no engine sound or rotor sounds such as a helicopter would make. My longest time observing the object was in the garage, which lasted for 20-25 seconds.  In that time I went through the momentary shock of seeing an object of this size, shape, and lack of engine noise hovering just above the power lines.  Once I grasped what I was observing, I began to look at the details and structure of the object. I have been around aircraft and aviation since I was a child, and can recognize almost any modern aircraft, including kit planes, helicopters, military aircraft (including RPV's), and commercial jetliners.  I have 2,700 hours time piloting single-engine aircraft with an instrument (IFR) rating.  In my entire experience, I have NEVER observed an aircraft this shape, size, or configuration.  And I have NEVER observed an aircraft silently accelerate from ZERO to what had to be multiple Mach speed and leave no sonic footprint. There were no other aircraft nearby, overhead, or with the object.  The nearest airport is KPGD ( Punta Gorda ) approx. 12 miles away to the SE.  Conditions were CAVU (ceiling and visibility unlimited), with a clear star field. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be very sober-minded.  We suspect that he is an excellent, and highly reliable, witness.  PD));26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092
