((anonymous report));2019-05-02 21:45:00;5 minutes;Partly cloudy but clear, occasionally quiet lightening above.  T storms about 2 hours ago  Erratic moving craft sparkling flashing bright red and white lights. I lost track of the first, which i had seen to my left. It appeared quickly at a higher elevation to the higher right side of my sky. I looked back to the left and lower was (maybe) the first one.  They appeared to move away in equal but opposite directions.  I just looked up...they are still in close proximity to where they began, but farther out. Yeah.  It made my heart stop a bit. I'm also a victim of missing time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092
