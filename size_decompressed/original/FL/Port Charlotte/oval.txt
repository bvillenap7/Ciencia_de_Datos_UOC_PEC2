At 12:40 a.m., I was walking inside our large screened-in pool cage looking up at the stars.  Something about a cluster of  stars caught my attention.  Looking straight up over our house, I clearly saw an egg shaped object, well lit and stationary with lights across the center and more light from right center angeled up across the top.  It had a blue light blinking at the center bottom half.   I searched the night sky for more.  I went outside our pool cage for clearer view and saw another down and to the right of the first, stationary blinking.   I turned slowly in a circle never taking my eyes of the night sky and saw a third one behind me.  They were all stationary, clearly egg shaped with white lights and a single blue blinker on bottom half.  3 together would equal size of half a moon.  These were large enough to see clear shape and light configuration.  No sound.   Never seen anything like these.   Lasted 15 minutes and they vanished.  No trail,just stopped being visib! le in an instant. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092
