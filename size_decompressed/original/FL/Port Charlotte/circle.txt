Stationary object flashing red and green over south west coast of Florida near vacinity of Port Charlotte.;2012-03-13 19:00:00;3 days;Stationary object flashing red and green over south west coast of Florida near vacinity of Port Charlotte. From 19:00 to 23:00 each day from March 13 through 15th an object appears in the same position approximately 20 degrees up from the south west horizon over the coastal gulf.  Object is stationary and ignored by commercial craft.   Viewed with both binoculars and 600mm professional lens object can be seen illuminating red and green lights suggesting commercial or military origin.  Lights move left to right.  Center is yellow white.  To distant to photograph accurately in such low light even with high speed settings.   Object was observed stationary for duration of time by two close neighbors in South Gulf Cove and by restaurant employees in south Boca Grande.   Commercial craft fly across path between object and and observation points.  Determined by fact object is blocked out as they pass.   Completely stationary until after 24:00 when object seems to move either north west or below horizon.  Uncertain as ambient light begins to interfere with view.  Local news was contacted had nothing on their scanners probably military;26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092
Orange light, possibly circle shaped moved slowly in the night sky before fading out.;2013-12-06 19:15:00;15-20 seconds;Orange light, possibly circle shaped moved slowly in the night sky before fading out A single light source, orange-colored and possibly circle-shaped not blinking or strobe, moving slowly NE at approximately 40Â° in the sky.  Have seen these orange colored ball UAP's before and like the others it faded out before disappearing completely.  The altitude of this one seemed quite a bit higher than the others though if I had to take a guess I'd say between 6,000 and 9,000 ft.  Checked the website flightaware and there were no aircraft in the area heading NE, or N or E for that matter.  Checked again a few minutes later still no aircraft on that flight course.;26.9881110091743;-82.1173532110092

They Where Fast And Steady Pace.  They Where Very Close Together.  But When Watching Them You Would See Three Separate Round Shapes.  The Sky was Clear Stars Bright.   I Checked On Line To See If Anyone Else Saw It. Only Came Across A NBC2 Story From From 2014 Same Day, New years.  Those Witlessness Described The Same Exact Thing I saw.
