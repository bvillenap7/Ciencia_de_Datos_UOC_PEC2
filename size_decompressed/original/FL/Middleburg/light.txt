I was living in Middleburg Florida directly off of State Road 218 right inbetween Mallard road and Nolan road.  It was June of 1992, and my family was sitting on the porch talking as they would do often.  I and my two cousins were in the next door neighbors backyard playing with their dog.  I happened to look southeast and see a light in the sky, which looked a lot like a star, just a bit brighter than most.  I dismissed it at first and continued playing around.  We lived in-between two Navy bases, Cecil Field and NAS JAX, so we were used to seeing planes and things flying by.  After my older cousin had stopped and took notice of this light we all three stopped to study it.  It seemed to be moving across the sky towards the northeast.  We ran from the neighbors yard to edge of my yard to get a better look, and in the process of running without taking our eyes off of the light, we all three ran into the fence which was barbed-wire (barbed-wire is almost invisible to see at dusk anyways).  When we reached the edge of my yard we just stood motionless staring at this light travel across the sky very slowly.  It then did something I have never heard of before.  Around the light itself, a sparkling, cloud-like bubble formed that was shaped like an egg.  It traveled with the light for a small time matching its movements perfectly.  The light then left the cloud, and the cloud disappeared very slowly.  After the two were separated the light moved about very spuratically across the sky in normal UFO fashion then disappeared completely.  The sighting must have lasted at least 25 minutes.  Just like in the movies, coincidence or not, at least 10 military helicopters showed up in the sky headed in the direction of the UFO right after it disappeared.;30.0843;-81.8629000000001
Freaked the hell out!;2014-08-03 21:30:00;5 minutes;Freaked the hell out! I was in my front yard, saw a light flash.  Looked like giant flashlight in the sky above the trees.  The light flipped off then 9 smaller lights appeared on the side of it.  It was roundish.   When it took off, it left a trail of the lights.;30.0843;-81.8629000000001
White ball of light.;2016-03-05 21:45:00;2 minutes;I was driving to work.  The sky was a little cloudy.  The SUV in front of me briefly stopped and pulled over.   That's when I saw a small, white ball of light go across the sky the disappear.  I guess the people in front of me saw it too because they had pulled over.   Later in the evening, I made a comment about it on social media and a friend of mine in the area reported that she and her family saw the same thing, too.
