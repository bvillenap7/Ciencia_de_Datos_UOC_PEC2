Slow moving fireball.;2017-11-12 19:03:00;2 minutes;Tonight, traveling North to South was a slow moving fireball moving in a slow straight line.  I happened to look up while standing outside with friends and family to see what appeared to be a fireball directly above us.  It was a cloudy night and the apparent fireball was very visible below the cloud deck.  There was no sound heard at all during this event.  I was able to capture a cell phone video approximately 30 seconds long before it flickered slightly and then completely faded out.  It did not travel out of viewing distance, it simply stopped and vanished.  What we witnessed tonight was completely unexplainable and unlike anything any of us had ever seen before.;30.1864043478261;-85.6460126086956
