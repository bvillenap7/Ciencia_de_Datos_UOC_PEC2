By the time the image of the triangle appeared in my eye it was gone. Along the imaginary line where the planets move across the sky, in the southeastern sky at about the spot where Mars would be seen at that time of night on that day, I saw a light streak that I thought was a shooting star except upon further attention it was the wrong color and too thick of a trail. By the time the image of the triangle appeared in my eye it was gone.  The length of the trail was the length of ones hand if you held it at arms length against the sky.  My first impression of what I saw was that I was seeing the underbelly of a plane or something of that sort, but then when I processed the whole event I realized that it couldn't have been a plane that close to the land with that configuration and there wouldn't be a chance to have the underbelly lit like it was.;30.1864043478261;-85.6460126086956
