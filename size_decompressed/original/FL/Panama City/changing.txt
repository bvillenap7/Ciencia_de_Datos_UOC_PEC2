May 3, 2020 at 3:15am Trieste Community in  Panama City Beach, FL  It started when i looked out of my window and saw a bright light..originally thought it was a medevac heli that i see often in middle of night .i always pull up flightaware when I see it....flightaware always shows it leaving one of the hospitals in town for either the Destin hospital or Pensacola…i opened a different app called RADAR24 this time..it showed nothing in the sky ..i ruled the medevac out fast..actually I remember ruling out pretty much everything that I thought it could be due based on how it moved around..never seen anything like it. . at times it would move like a helicopter..then circle like a plane would circle…i have been into planes my entire life..during the day I can tell you what type of plane is flying overhead at 30,000 ft...this thing was out of the ordinary..(the way it moved)..it did 2 or 3 circles like you would see an airliner circle…then it did a slow dive before going back to the same position…  This had been going on for 20 minutes..i was able to find  some  binoculars.. i could actually see shapes with an outline…but the shapes would change as it moved around. at first it was a triangle with a bright spot in the middle…at some point it looked like a bright light with a big circle shape below..  at one point it started to leave but came back..when it did leave, it went away fast. about 20 seconds before i lost sight …during that 20 seconds, there were 2 bright lights on it…one on each side.…almost looked like “cartoon”  speed….compared to how it was moving  until that point…. it never returned.;30.1864043478261;-85.6460126086956
