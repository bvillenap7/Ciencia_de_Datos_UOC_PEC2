At approx. 3:00 in the morning, my backyard suddenly lit up with a brilliant bright, white light.  The light came from above the trees because the shadows looked like shadows at noon.  There was no wind to disturb any of the trees or shrubbery.  Above the trees were yellow and red strobing lights.  Accompaning the bright lights was a very high pitch warbling sound (think typical sci-fi sound effect). I pulled on some pants and ran outside with my dad but by this time the object had turned on what sounded like a jet engine and headed toward the east.  The warbling continued but the primary sound was one of a jet. With the departure of the object, everything returned to quiet. We have rarely spoken about this incident.

Looked like stars in the sky so far up/moveing fast;1997-09-18 20:15:00;30 seconds;looked like stars in the sky so far up/moveing fast My husbend and i was on vacation.  We were on the pier and i was looking up at the stars.  It was a beautyfull night.  He was fishing off of the pier.  I could see all of the stars and i thought i was looking at some planes but thay were to far up in the sky.  They looked like stars.  Thay were going so fast i tought that thay were going to crash into each other but thay didn't.  They flew so fast and then thay just stopped.I had to rub my eyes and look again.  They were still there.  I knew it was not planes because thay didn't have the red lights on them and just stopped in mid air.  I kept looking but thay didn't move after that.  I know it has been a long time sents then but i just found out how to tell you.  I can't get it off my mind. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Multiple objects of varying kinds being chase by fighters from tyndall AFB;2006-02-08 19:22:00;3 min;Multiple objects of varying kinds being chase by fighters from tyndall AFB Crystal clear night, stepped outside to have a cigarette, live near Tyndall AFB in panama city, looked up because I heard jets.  At first I saw three fighters and one craft of unknown shape that was lit up all over, yellowish lights hard to tell what shape.  One of the fighters was within a couple three hundred feet of it and the other two were approximatly 2 miles behind in hot pursuit.  The large object peeled off and was out of sight in a matter of seconds, however the fighters did not follow but they did kick on their afterburners until I couldn't see them anymore, even w/ bino's.  Called my girlfriend outside to see this and apparently while I was looking at her telling her what I saw, she saw something move very quickly across the sky 1 sec +-, this definatly freaked her out.  As I continued to watch the jets and afterburners, I caught comething by pure chance moving at a high rate of speed, thought it was a dim star but it was moving extremely fast coming from the direction the jets were heading,  At this point the base came alive and more jets were put into the air.  Didn't see anything else.;30.1864043478261;-85.6460126086956
