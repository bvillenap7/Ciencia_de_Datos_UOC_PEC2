Both circular objects were red and moving independently of each other in a small diameter.  The first one blinked twice and disappeared, while the second red orb stayed stationary until it, too, flashed several times and disappeared.  Approximately 3 seconds later the first red orb reappeared flashed once, and again disappeared immediately.;30.1864043478261;-85.6460126086956

However, nothing else is filtered on this photo.  The clouds and sun is how the iPhone lens picked it up!  The UFO was NOT seen in real time.  The only thing seen while recording was the seagulls.  I originally took out my phone to record the seagulls because they were flying really low to the people and was abnormal, considering no one had any food. Once I got home I realized this video looked different.  It looked like a storm was coming and it was a beautiful, sunny day.  When I slowed the video down, I recognized the UFO.   No harm, no foul.  Enjoy.;30.1864043478261;-85.6460126086956
