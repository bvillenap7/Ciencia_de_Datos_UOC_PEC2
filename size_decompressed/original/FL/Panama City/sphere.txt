It was a clear starry night, comfortable temps.  I thought I'd seen a star go out and mentioned it.  As we watched,  it came back on, repeating this on a few seconds then off.    It approached to about 50 yards out in the gulf, dropped to the water,  raised back up,  came in to where the water (calm) met the shore.  Hovered about 30 feet away from us, 10 feet off the ground, silently. It was spherical and just smaller than a soccer ball.  We stood up,  I took one step to go look closer, it took off in an arc to the sky westward, must have covered 3 miles in a second or better. Years later, I was contacted by my friend and I asked her to recount the story. She still had the same story I had, except that as we stood. She wanted to run away.

Several round orange-yellow glowing objects over western end of Panama City, FL beach;2007-07-21 21:00:00;30 minutes;Several round orange-yellow glowing objects over western end of Panama City, FL beach My family and I were vacationing at the western-most end of Panama City the night of July 21, 2007.  It was around 9:00 pm and we had just finished having dinner on the balcony of our 15th floor condo.  My husband took our two kids (ages 9 & 14) to walk on the beach.  I remained on the balcony, speaking to my mother on the telephone.  I sat on the balcony looking directly out at the ocean and sky.  It was dark, but the surface of the water and the sky were very discernable.  It was easy to make out where one ended and the other began.  As I looked out, I noticed a large, round. orange-yellow glowing object appear in the sky.  Over the next few minutes, four others just like it also appeared.  The objects would glow and disappear on and off for several minutes to follow.  Three other objects, exactly the same size and shape as the original five, appeared off to the right in a triangle pattern shortly after.  In a span of approximately thirty minutes, several objects appeared in the sky and never moved.  The only change in their appearance or position was that they glowed on and off at different intervals.  As this was happening, I told my mother that I thought I was seeing UFOs.  She laughed until I told her that I was absolutely serious.  At that time my husband and kids came rushing back into the condo asking if I had seen the strange light in the sky.  We watched the sky for many hours that night, and every night for the remainder of our vacation.  We saw nothing more of the strange lights.  Until the night of July 21st, I absolutely did NOT believe in UFOs.  I thought anyone who claimed to believe in such things was a nut.  I still don’t believe that there are little green men flying around our atmosphere, but I do know that my family and I saw something that cannot be explained by anything we have ever seen before.  They were not planes – they never moved.  They were not helicopters -- they were much larger and perfectly round.  They were not fireworks.  They glowed on and off in the sky and then vanished.  Two other strange events happened in connection with our sighting.  First, when we awoke the next morning, we immediately searched the news stations for reports of the strange light, because we were certain that someone else HAD to have seen what we saw.  We could find nothing on television, so I checked the Internet.  On The Drudge Report there was a story about a UFO sighting in England – with pictures.  The photos were exactly what we had seen several hours later in Panama City, FL.  After I had read all of the articles that I could find regarding the strange event in England, I came upon this site and one other where I could post information regarding our sighting.  I filled out the required information and uploaded my account.  I was aware that there could be some lapse between the time that I posted our information and the time that it appeared on the sites, but my postings never made either of the sites.  It was as if they never existed.;30.1864043478261;-85.6460126086956

Two bright orbs zig zagging over Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida.;2012-02-16 19:00:00;5 minutes;Two bright orbs zig zagging over Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. My husband and I were outside on our back patio watching the jets fly in to Tyndall Air Force Base from Eglin Air Force Base.  It was cloudy but the jets were flying low enough to cause very loud noise and we have always been able to see the jets clearly because we are only seven miles from the landing strip.   After the jets landed, we saw two bright orbs, what we thought were very bright stars high up in the sky, higher than the jets.  The one on the left was zig zagging back and forth and the one on the right was just drifting slowly towards the left.  This went on for about five minutes, zig zagging from here to there and then the lights just disappeared.   There was no fading of lights, no sound, and absolutely no tracers.   We watch the jets come in every night and have never experienced this kind of thing.   My husband is a non-believer in UFO's.  This has changed his mind.;30.1864043478261;-85.6460126086956
