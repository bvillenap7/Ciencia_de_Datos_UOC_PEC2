Jets investigating object over Gulf of Mexico;2002-02-16 15:00:00;1 minute;Jets investigating object over Gulf of Mexico While fishing approx. 10 miles s of PC in the Gulf of Mexico, witnessed 5 unusually slow flying fighter jets heading southeastward between us and the coast.  As they flew further down the coast, we noticed a strange white stationary object above/in front of fighters.  The jets looked to be investigating the object.  Went to search for binoculars but I could no longer see either the jets or the object.;30.1864043478261;-85.6460126086956
Black Oval Shaped Halo Moving in the Christmas Night Sky;2006-12-25 22:30:00;15 seconds;Black Oval Shaped Halo Moving in the Christmas Night Sky I was trying to get out of my car to go into my house and as I was having a lot of back pain I had to hoist myself up out of the car.   As I pulled myself up out of my car, I was kind of looking forward yet up.  My 14 year old son was at my side just in case my pinched nerve in my back wouldn't allow me to hoist myself fully up.   I'm trying to get out of the car and all of the sudden I see this kind of black, flattened oval shaped thing jut out from behind this big star.  It seemed black in the middle and had this white lighted halo surrounding the black flat oval thing.   I literally gasped in shock and stopped dead in my tracks because I couldn't believe my eyes.   My son asked me if I was okay and I said yes, but that I'd just saw this thing in the sky.  I described it, we both glanced back up and I thought it sounded ridiculous so I just dropped it and we went into the house.   I told my mother about the occurence and she suggested I report it so I am.   It was really a shock to me, it looked like it came out from behind the star, but I wasn't looking long at all so I don't know, but I do know I saw what I saw and it was weird.

Stat. hovering object with blinking green and red lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the objects may be twinkling stars.  PD));2010-10-16 21:20:00;stationary;Stationary hovering object with blinking green and red lights. At approximately 21:15 on October 16, 2010, my wife and son summoned me outside to observe a strange pulsating object in the distant sky.  Unfortunately, we do not own a telescope or device for distant magnification of objects.   Using a pair of binoculars I looked toward the object to see what I could. Primary observation revealed what appeared to be pulsating star.  However, as I focused further on the object, I noticed a blinking red and green light.  I told my family that it was nothing more than an aircraft like a plane, blimp, etc.  The thing that made me wonder is that the object never moved.  Also, my wife informed me that many nights, while outside walking and such, she has observed the same occurence in other parts of the sky resembling the same thing. We are just an ordinary working family with two kids and a couple of dogs.  Never been into reporting ufo's or starting contreversy on the issue.  Not looking for any big news or public attention on the issue.  Just wondering what the object may be. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the objects may be twinkling stars.
