Three boomerang shaped objects hover the ocean.;2003-03-13 23:00:00;10-15 seconds;Three boomerang shaped objects hover the ocean. I was very shocked by what on the evening of March 13.  I was at the beach looking at the stars and a few boats in the distance.  To my left I was looking at a boat and out of the corner of my eye I saw what appeared to be a flash of light.  I quickly looked and realized it was the shape of a boomerang or sideways V. It was fire orange with no distinctness about it.  I thought it was quite strange but I figured it was a flash from a boat.  It stayed there  for a few seconds and slowly went away. Shortly after another one appeared all in slow motion, it went away and then another showed up. I had no idea what this was. I looked around hopeing someone else saw the same thing.  No one else was around.  All day jets had been flying by and I thought maybe that was what it was, but it was silent and it was bright orange (jets arent orange).  I have no idea what I saw.  After reading a few siteing I read one from the fall of 2001 from Panama City and it sound quite familiar.  Beats me what was but it was a sight i will never forget.;30.1864043478261;-85.6460126086956
