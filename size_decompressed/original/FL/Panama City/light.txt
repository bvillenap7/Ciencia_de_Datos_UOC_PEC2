Panama City UFO;2003-06-23 04:24:00;12 minutes;Panama City UFO At 04:24 this morning I witnessed what I though at first was a shooting star. It was moving at a quick pace, then stopped and stayed in one place for about 5 minutes and then started traveling again in a different direction and then disappeared. It was too far up to see a shape, but appeared to be white in color much like a star, seemed to be as high as the stars in the morning sky and the same size as a small star.;30.1864043478261;-85.6460126086956
Red Orb Light (Not Blinking).;2006-11-16 18:42:00;about 40 sec;Red Orb Light (Not Blinking). This is the third time this month i've seen this same thing.  I went outside to smoke a cigg. at 6:42 central standard time.  I was looking up at the stars, when i notice a plane coming from the east.   I looked to the west and there it was a red orb light (not blinking).  The orb was comeing from the west going east and there was another plane going the same direction as the red orb.  The plane coming from the west was ahead of the orb.  What i thought was strange, was that the orb and the plane going in the same diection were close to each other when the orb past the plane.  The Red orb seemed to be moving faster than the plane.  The planes could have been jets, i did hear jet engine.  I could not tell if it was from the to planes in the sky or the none flashing red orb.;30.1864043478261;-85.6460126086956
My attention was drawn to the SW at a bright light slightly bigger and brighter than the stars.;2014-04-04 20:31:00;1:30;I went outside to smoke a cigarette and looked up in the night sky as I normally do and almost immediately my attention was drawn to the SW at a bright light slightly bigger and brighter than the stars,   I watched its course and the light itself wondering if maybe it was a plane at high altitude.  I am 100% certain it was not, its course was not a straight line but looked almost like it were a fire fly trying to fly straight the speed was eerily constant and slowish.  As I watched the light come in from the SW, I continued to watch it until it was the the NE of me, where it seemed to slow down and turn a bland orange color, and proceeded to disappear completely.  I do not mean it traveled until I could no longer see it it faded like flame dying in darkness.   This is the first time I have ever encountered something I can not explain.;30.1864043478261;-85.6460126086956
