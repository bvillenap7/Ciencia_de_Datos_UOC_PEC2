3 transparent Delta-wing shaped obects flying in formation over the Gulf of Mexico in 1986;1986-06-07 19:00:00;30 Seconds;3 transparent Delta-wing shaped obects flying in formation over the Gulf of Mexico in 1986 In the late spring, 1986, I was at Panama City Beach, Florida, with a friend of mine. It was dusk, and the stars were just beginning to come out.  We were standing at the edge of the beach when something in the air caught my friend's eye.  At that time, he was a policeman serving the Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, and he is to this day still employed as a policeman.  I had just started graduate school.   He motioned to me to look up.  As we watched, we saw three delta-wing shaped objects flying in a V-formation at what appeared to be a very high altitude out over the water in the Gulf of Mexico.  The three objects flew south for a few seconds and then banked to the west.   As they did so, we both were amazed that we could see stars through the objects.  They were luminous, but not hugely bright.  They appeared to be transparent or had a certain hard-to-describe transparent quality about them.   As they banked, they increased in speed and, still in a V-formation, they zoomed out of sight in a just a few seconds. The sighting lasted for 20 to 30 seconds max.  The objects made no noise that we were able to detect.   My friend and I went back to the house where we were staying and took out pencils and paper.  We went in separate rooms and drew what we had seen just to make sure we had both seen exactly the same thing.  We compared our drawings and they were the same.  Neither of us were on drugs or alcohol.   I have carried this experience with me for many years and would sign a sworn affidavit attesting to the truth of this sighting.;30.1864043478261;-85.6460126086956
At first It looked like a drone but it was moving way too fast and there was no sound so I knew it wasn't a drone but it didn't appear;2019-09-28 02:00:00;15 seconds;At first It looked like a drone but it was moving way too fast and there was no sound so I knew it wasn't a drone but it didn't appear to be that high in the air so maybe a jet but again no sound that we could hear.  It went across the sky and vanished into thin air.  Very crazy and scary.;30.1864043478261;-85.6460126086956
