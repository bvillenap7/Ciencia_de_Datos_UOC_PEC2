No craf;1998-03-07 18:40:00;60 seconds;Traveling east spotted two white lights 30 degrees elevation. They were strangely foggy in appearance but moved independently.  No craft visible. Returning home from work on March 7, 1998, I turned east on Bullard Parkway off 56th street in Temple Terrace, Florida.  My attention was drawn to two bright white lights aboput 30 degrees above the horizon and visible in my windshield.  They were strangely out of focus or hazy.  They moved independently from one another, i.e. they tilted.  Each was more or less formless, but also strangely each seemed to have a shaft of light pointing down as though each light was fastened to the bottom of an aircraft and pointed straight down.  But the shafts of light were not vertical cylindars, but truncated cones of white light.  Neither pointed down very far.  I estimated that they were less than one mile away and perhaps 2000 feet high, given their brightness.  I became concerned tgaht I would drive under them and lose sight of them, but it did not occur to me to stop off the highway and get out to look up. As I drew closer they were higher in my windshield, so I moved forward against the steering wheel to keep them in sight.  Before I reach my turn off the right hand light faded and disappeared, then the second light faded and disappeared.  They were rather peculiar, so I was at first reluctant to tell my wife, but I finally did before we went out for the evening.  I checked the sky as we left home about 7:30 but they were not to be seen.  I was relieved to see a haze in the sky then, as that would explain their foggy or out of focus appearance.  On the other hand the cloud layer was much to high to have had an effect.  I do not wish my name to be used! (NUFORC:  Probable missile launch.));28.0385999999999;-82.3695999999996
