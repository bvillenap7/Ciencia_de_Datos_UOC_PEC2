Sheathed stealth bomber.;2020-10-17 20:15:00;20 seconds;Sheathed stealth bomber. This looked like an iridescent boomerang or like a stealth bomber with a sheath over it. It moved about the speed of a jet but silent and it was lower than the planes in the flight path . And you could almost see through it like a cloud but ghosts like. Like a plane with a sheet over it.  Both myself and my husband saw this.;28.0385999999999;-82.3695999999996
