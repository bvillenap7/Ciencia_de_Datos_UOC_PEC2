disc shaped object spinning w/lights, no sound, hovering over me and husband in our pool in daylight.;1980-06-01 13:00:00;3 minutes;disc shaped object spinning w/lights, no sound, hovering over me and husband in our pool in daylight. My husband at the time were in our pool in FL in broad daylight.  We witnessed an object coming very quickly over us. It was round with flashing lights and no sound.  It hovered over us and the pool. My husband told me to run and get the camera.  When I came back out it was traveling upwards at a high rate of speed and I took pictures but it was out of sight in a matter of seconds.  I still have those pictures but all I see on there is a little white spot since the sun was very bright that day.  My husband called the airforce and the airport and they knew of nothing that would do that.  That husband is deceased now so can't put him down as a witness.;28.0385999999999;-82.3695999999996
