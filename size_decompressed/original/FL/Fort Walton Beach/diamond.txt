Bright white Diamond shaped craft with bright vapor trail seen in Fort Walton Beach, FL 7/10/12;2012-07-10 22:45:00;2-3 seconds;Bright white Diamond shaped craft with bright vapor trail seen in Fort Walton Beach, FL 7/10/12 Around 11pm I saw a bright white diamond shaped object dashing across the sky with a thick white trail of light behind it.  It was traveling very fast at a slight downward slant towards the ground. I am 99.9% sure that it was not a shooting star. I have seen a shooting star before, once as a child and about 8 or 9 years ago as an adult.  They seem to disintegrate shortly after hitting the earths' atmosphere.  This object did not fade at all as it flew behind the trees at a downward slant towards the ground.  I happened to have my windows and doors opened last night because it was exceptionally cool after the rain and happened to be looking at the sky when this object suddenly appeared, dashing across the sky.  This sighting only lasted about 2 or 3 seconds, but I am pretty sure of what it wasn't and have no idea what it was. It was a very bright white diamond shaped craft with a thick white, vapor trail that looked like a beam of light behind it. Difficult to say! how large it was. I was approximately 200 yards away from the object. I am a business professional, currently unemployed. I do have a degree in Business Administration and am over the age of 40 years old. I can tell you that this is not a hoax and I would not be wasting everyones time reporting this if I did not feel that this was a genuine sighting. I have studied UFOs for many years and this was like nothing I have ever seen before. I am near one of the largest military bases in the world and about 30 miles away from Gulf Breeze, FL. I told my roomate about it and he said that I should report it, so that if anyone else saw it in the general Fort Walton Beach area that would make it more credible. Keep watching the skies!!;30.4391139534884;-86.6272325581394
