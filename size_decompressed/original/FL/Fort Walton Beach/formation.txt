Formation encircling air space above Eglin AFB;2021-01-19 19:00:00;Ongoing;Formation encircling air space above Eglin AFB On Tuesday 01/19/21 at approx  19:00 hours I was walking my dogs when I saw a strange light in the sky. It was stationary and hovering in one spot. It had colored lights that flashed. I then realized there were more and they appeared to form a circle over the area of Eglin Air Force Base. I have been here for four months and never seen this anomaly as I walked my dogs at night . It has been 1.5 hours since I first noticed them and they are still in position. As I’ve watched them I’ve realized that there are two different kinds. The major circle is formed with the larger ones with colored lights. However , there are some smaller ones that are white lights and could almost pass for stars. However their light constantly dims and brightens . As I was taking photos they would dim and be in some photos but not others .;30.4391139534884;-86.6272325581394
