((HOAX??))  10+ Silent Round Fireball Looking Ojects Fly overhead in a straight line.  REAL!!!;2016-04-29 09:25:00;20;10+ Silent Round Fireball Looking Ojects Fly overhead in a straight line.  REAL!!! I was sitting on the back porch playing a game on my phone and the battery died.  I threw my hands up and slung my head back like crap my phones dead.  as I looked up I noticed these silent round fireballs in a line following each other.  some piggy backing some by themselves but all going the same direction and the same flight path.  As they passed by they seemed to just vanish into thin air and disappear.   In dismay, I ran inside and woke my friend who was asleep on the sofa and made him come outside and check it out.   About 8 more came through and neither of us could believe what we were seeing.  I ran back inside and grabbed his phone and started filming.  I have about a 2-3 minute video of the last one as it passes by and disappears.   we also took several photos but a smart phone camera is only so good.  They were completely silent and If my phone hadn't died I would have never even have know they were there.  THIS WAS A REAL SIGHTING!;30.4391139534884;-86.6272325581394
