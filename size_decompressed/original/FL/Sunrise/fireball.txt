Orange fireballs spotted over South Florida, traveling alongside a plane.;2014-01-25 22:45:00;3 minutes;Orange fireballs spotted over South Florida, traveling alongside a plane My mother and I saw three orange fireball UFOs in the sky.  Two of the fireballs dimmed and disappeared except for a small red light, while the third stayed lit.  The one that stayed lit had an orange light, but also a bright yellow light underneath.   These crafts were traveling alongside (what I assume is) an airplane.  While the plane made a noise, the three other aircraft did not.  All aircrafts were traveling east from the Florida Everglades toward the Fort Lauderdale beach, except for one of the unlit crafts, which turned north as it faded away.;26.1356166666667;-80.1493833333333
