Glowing round sphere that split in to many pieces.;2014-06-06 20:20:00;3 minutes;Glowing round sphere that split in to many pieces. I was driving west on 595 at 8:20 pm and noticed a large round glowing object in the distance to the west.  The object was round and glowing at first and then appeared to change shape and break into several other pieces.   I took pictures of the largest one and did not realize there were many until I enlarged the pictures.  I actually called 911 and reported it because it reminded me of what the space shuttle looked like when it came apart a over Texas.   My wife also witnessed this with me and I have 10 pictures of the objects, so I know I did not hallucinate this.;26.1356166666667;-80.1493833333333
