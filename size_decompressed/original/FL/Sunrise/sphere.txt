On tuesday Dec 17 at 9:00pm my friend and I were on our way home from the sawgrass mills mall. In Sunrise Fl. The highway that we were on runs north and south.To the west is all Everglades, to the east is Sunrise, Up in the sky way way west we saw a comet shaped object moving west to east in an arc shaped motion.It looked like a blueish sphere with a reddish comet-like tail.It was way too high to see any real detail. The object was moving at an incredable rate of speed. Suddenly the comet tail went out and all you could see was the blue orb. When the UFO was over the road (still way to high to see detail) the tailfired twice, like some kind ofafte rburners.And was rocketed out of sight to the east ina matter of seconds, way faster than anything either of us had ever seen. My friend and I know alot about airplanes and this fits no description we could make. Planes appear to be moving slowly from afar, not this thing.We have absoultly no explanation for this.It !must have traveled 50 or 60 miles in the extent of 60 to 90 seconds.Please post this so I can find out if anyone else saw it. There were plenty of other cars on the road at this time. Thanks Dan This story also appears at  http://mother.com/~green3/ufo/dan.htm;26.1356166666667;-80.1493833333333
Green, blue, reddish lights in Sunrise, FL unusual movements and speed without noise.;2014-03-02 22:30:00;5 minutes;Green, blue, reddish lights in Sunrise, FL unusual movements and speed without noise. I came out and saw a stationary object, very low of the ground.  It was sitting still.  Right above the road next to our community.  It was bright green, then it changed color to blue.   It was not  a helicopter or airplane, it produced no noise  at all.  I started videotaping then it moved and changed color to reddish (not bright red like on airplanes).   Moved horizontally to the right, changed colors.   I stopped recording and then it moved back and turned green then vertically descended,straight down and very fast.  Scary.

Sphere in the sky over Sunrise, FL, emitted lights that constantly shifted and changed colors before disappearing.;2014-04-28 23:30:00;30 seconds;Sphere in the sky over Sunrise, FL, emitted lights that constantly shifted and changed colors before disappearing. Upon leaving the BB&T Center after a concert on March 28th, 2014, my father noticed a sphere in the sky moving irregularly and changing colors rapidly.  The colors were constantly shifting from green to purple to blue and red.   After noticing it and trying to film it on an iphone (poor quality) for ten seconds, it quickly disappeared.  My father said it zipped away in an impossible speed in the opposite direction it had been moving.;26.1356166666667;-80.1493833333333
