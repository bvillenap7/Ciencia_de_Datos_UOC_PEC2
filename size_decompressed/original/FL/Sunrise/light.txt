I spotted a bright light over the everglades west of the sawgrass exp. The light moved from the west to the south in one second I pulled over to the side of the road where it was as dark as posible MY girl friend and I got out of the car and watched it changing colors from a bright white to a bright red to a bright green over and over again It was not a plain because it stayed in one spot for at least ten min. We watched  until the cloud covered it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not specify (apparent) size of the object, so we can only guess at what it is they observed.  The star, Sirius, would be in the southern sky at this hour, and it is very prominent, flashing all the colors indicated by the witness.  PD));26.1356166666667;-80.1493833333333
bright star-like objects that changes colors and brightness;2003-03-29 20:30:00;7-10 minutes;bright star-like objects that changes colors and brightness myself and husband were sitting infront of our house, just to smoke a cigarette, looked up at the night sky noticed several stars but one in particular which seemed to blink more than the others, after watching it with my husband we both noticed that the star was obviously changing colors blue, green, red, and white. From my location which is on University Drive facing west, this star looked to be somewhere over the everglades.  We both continued to watch this star change color and going from being bright to dim and then bright again, we watched for almost 10 full minutes before it just faded out.  I have only recently began to observe our sky more closely but i have never seen star do such things in all my life. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses may have observed, but we believe that a twinkling star, or the landing light on an approaching airliner, would be the first possibilities to be ruled out.

Possible UFO sighting in Sunrise, Florida during 4th of July celebration.;2012-07-04 21:38:00;20 seconds;Possible UFO sighting in Sunrise, Florida during 4th of July celebration. While walking back home from Plantation Central Park in Plantation, FL. My husband and i could see the fireworks still going on North.  We assume the fireworks were going on in Sunrise, Florida.  After the fireworks were done there were 7 red lights in a vertical line much brighter than any firework, and they lingered brightly for about 20 seconds.  Without saying a word to each other, both my husband and I stopped walking trying to figure out what we were looking at.  The location did not coincide with Hollywood Intl. Airport or the Fort Lauderdale executive airport.  The red lights were too far and too bright to be planes.  We are about 10 miles from Hollywood Intl. Airport and could actually see planes heading in that direction so we could clearly compare the planeâ€™s flashing red lights with the constant red light hovering at a fixed location in the sky.  After the lights disappeared (not faded, just disappeared) my husband just said that was probably our first ! UFO sighting.;26.1356166666667;-80.1493833333333

Blue and Red light over the Everglades.;2014-03-12 22:20:00;3 minutes;Blue and Red light over the Everglades. Very bright single light fading from red to blue seen over the Everglades.  It headed east-northeast for a few seconds then headed back to its original position, then disappeared.  No sound. We get lots of air traffic  (large planes, small planes and helicopters) mostly from west-southwest to east  for we live between the Everglades and Ft. Lauderdale International Airport, so we are no strangers to lights in the sky, but thie blue was so intense - almost like the blue in police cars, that I had to stay and observe.;26.1356166666667;-80.1493833333333
Very low bright light staying in area for more than 30 minutes but does move.;2014-04-09 20:50:00;30 minutes;Very low bright light staying in area for more than 30 minutes but does move. There was one object that could have been mistaken for a star or satellite, but it was way too low to the ground.  Looked like a really bright light.  It stayed hoovering in one location for several minutes and then started to slowly move higher.  But I would turn my head and it would move, I didn't physically see it move.  So it moved fast, but then would stop and stay in one place for a while. It has moved to several locations since. I put 30 minutes, but it is still within view. I text my friend in Fort Myers, FL, that I thought I saw a UFO and explained it to her.  She said she saw the same thing last week.;26.1356166666667;-80.1493833333333
