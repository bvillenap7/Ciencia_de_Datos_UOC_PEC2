Loud boom followed by the ground shaking.;2014-01-22 10:00:00;2 seconds;Loud boom followed by the ground shaking. Because someone local reported a very similar incident and on the same date and time I chose to report what I experienced, too. I was outside of my home in the driveway before 12:00 noon cleaning bird poop off my car, when all of the sudden I heard a very loud boom.  It sounded like the sonic boom from an aircraft.  The windows in the front room of the house also shook like they can with loud thunder.   I recall looking around quickly to see if anyone else was out to corroborate or if there was anything unusual in the area or in the sky when a second later I felt the ground beneath me shake.  It was a short rumble that lasted about one second.  I thought it was an earthquake because the ground definitely shook.  First the boom then the shaking.   I looked around and saw nothing unusual and waited several minutes to see if it would happen again or if something else was going to happen but nothing did.  I was surprised that neighbors who were home did not come out to look around because it was that impressive. The local fellow who reported a similar event on this same day and time was in Miramar which is a good ten miles southwest from where I live.  Amazing!   I know that they are dredging a tunnel in the port of Miami.  A neighbor said that because the ground in this area is solid coral rock it might be possible for the shock wave to travel this far, 25 miles!  I really don't know about that but I suppose it is possible.  What is odd is that the boom seemed to definitely be an above ground event. I have not known earthquakes to be preceded by a loud boom.  I would really like to know what happened.  If you have any information on this event please let me know.   Thanks.;26.1356166666667;-80.1493833333333
Color changing plus sign disappears into thin air;2014-03-03 22:55:00;5 minutes;Color changing plus sign disappears into thin air The aircraft could be seen a quarter mile away, and was a simple plus shape.  It was changing colors smoothly from teal to magenta to green.   When I first saw it, it was moving around like a remote control vehicle.  However, when I pulled over to get a better look, it was stationary.  It wasn't as high as a plane would be,  and was smaller than a normal passenger plane as well.  When it did move, it did so perfectly fluently, no sudden stops or starts.  All of a sudden it flickered and became dimmer, then the light disappeared and so did the vehicle.  No traces.
