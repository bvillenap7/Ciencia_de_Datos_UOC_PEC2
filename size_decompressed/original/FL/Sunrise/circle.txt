Ten small orange lights in random formation, moving slowly north in western sky of Sunrise, Florida at 22.45;2013-02-12 22:45:00;2-3 minutes;Ten small orange lights in random formation, moving slowly north in western sky of Sunrise, Florida at 22.45 Ten small orange lights were seen moving slowly north in the lower western sky of Sunrise over the Everglades.  They appeared to be in a random formation.  One of the lights seemed to move south. The rest disappeared moving north west.  It was assumed that they must be helicopters as that was the only rational explanation, and there was a slight sound of what might have been a helicopter in the distance.  One observer is a retired lawyer aged 68 and the other a housewife aged 66.;26.1356166666667;-80.1493833333333
Changing lights very fast speeds, movement up and down.;2014-03-11 22:30:00;30 minutes;changing lights very fast speeds, movement up and down. My buddy that lives in my neighborhood called me to look outside.  I went outside and saw a flying object.  We live by an airport and this was no airplane.  It was constantly changing color from blue green purple yellow white then red in the middle with blue on the outside.  It would move up and down then go very fast east and stop immediately.  When a plane approached all the lights turned off.  As the plane made a sharp turn South the lights came back on but simply blinking and headed toward the everglades.  About 15 minutes later I went back outside and noticed it seemed to start over again with the same color changing and movement. I have never seen anything like this before.;26.1356166666667;-80.1493833333333

The objects were very bright orange, had no sound, moving slowing and not that far about in the sky.  Direction was from the south to north.
