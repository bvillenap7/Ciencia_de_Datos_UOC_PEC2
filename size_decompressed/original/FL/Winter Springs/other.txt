Domed craft, lime green colored, daylight sighting.;2003-01-11 12:10:00;5 minutes;Domed craft, lime green colored, daylight sighting. While standing in my backyard, with a friend, I spotted a bright object coming from the southwest. It was very high up and moving in a slow, straight line and faded into the east. I asked my friend to have a look and we watched the object for approx. 5 minutes. At one point I ran, very fast, into the house to grab the binoculars. The object was somewhat flat on the bottom and domed on top. Not like pictures of flying saucers that I've seen. The top was domed like half of a circle. The object seemed compact in shape, not long and stretched out like an airplane. The object was a very strange shade of green, kind of lime colored, and never changed it's brightness. It was almost as if the brightness was a light and not necessarily the color of the object. It was VERY bright. We've lived near airports our entire lives and have never seen a craft this shape.;28.6840999999993;-81.2811999999985
strange orange golden sky  with double rainbow with horizontal lightning for at least 30 mins.;2004-07-04 20:00:00;30min;strange orange golden sky  with double rainbow with horizontal lightning for at least 30 mins. It was 4th of July 2004. I was watching tv and noticed the sky had a strange color.  I went outside and saw the sky from ALL around (a strange color golden sky) very very strange with lighting going through the sky horizontal. There was a perfect double rainbow and the neighbors were all outside looking at the strange sky.  I did not see any craft but the sky was really strange.   I was looking at the other sightings on this day and Winter Spirngs is just next to that dog rack road in Casselberry, Florida where the other people on this website reported what had happend.  There was NO news coverage.  I feel this definitly was a coverup as does the other people that witnesed that strange sky. If it was a crash of a satilight, the sky would not be that color for all that time.;28.6840999999993;-81.2811999999985
Looked like plane was going to crash behind one of the buildings in my community.;2009-01-10 00:00:00;30 seconds;Looked like plane was going to crash behind one of the buildings in my community. I live in an apartment complex, I was sitting on the porch around 12:00 PM, when I noticed what looked like a plane flying right above the building, going in a downward motion behind one of the buildings. There is no Airport in the direction in which it was going down, and it went down extremely fast. I thought for sure that I would hear a plane crashing, but there was nothing. It just disappeared. Also, the object made barely any noise, Had it been a plane I am sure it would have made more noise than what I was hearing. Baffling!!!!;28.6840999999993;-81.2811999999985
