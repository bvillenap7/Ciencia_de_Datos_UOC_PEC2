star looking object next to the moon;2003-07-17 05:45:00;15 minutes;star looking object next to the moon My husband and I were leaving for work and I looked up at the moon and noticed what looked like a star next to the moon. It was very bright with kind of a yellowish color to it. I told my husband to look at it and I ran in the house and got the binoculars. It didn't look any bigger through the binoculars. We both thought it was really strange to see a star that close to the moon and in all of our years we have never seen anything like it. Logic tells me it was a planet and if it was I would like to know which one. ((NUFORC Note:  Mars.  PD));28.6840999999993;-81.2811999999985
Strange appearing/disappearing white light;2006-03-02 02:30:00;2-3 seconds;Strange appearing/disappearing white light I was outside at 2:30 am having a smoke (wife does not allow smoking in the house), I was looking up at the stars wondering if I could get a photograph of them. Suddenly a bright white light appeared out of nowhere traveling south to north at a very high rate of speed and then disappeared into the dark. No noise was heard, was to low to be a shooting star. There was no trail. It appeared more oval that a ball. No other lights visable. It was hard to determined altitude but it appeared low like about the altitude of a low flying airplane. It just lasted for just a few seconds. It would be like if you were invisible and running and then threw a switch, exposed yourself and quickly shut it off. You would appear and then disappear... Normally I don't make these types of reports because when I told my friends this tale, they asked what I was smoking.;28.6840999999993;-81.2811999999985
I saw a large bright flashing light flying across the sky outside of my window.;2014-05-14 23:20:00;A few seconds;I saw a large bright flashing light flying across the sky outside of my window. I was laying in bed when I just happened to glance out my window, and heading towards the south I saw this large white light with a blue tend flying across the sky extremely fast and blinking along the way. The light was about as big as the moon, but slightly smaller.  It had a bluish tint.  I could not figure out whether there was more than just one, because as soon as I went into my yard to get a better look at it, the object was nowhere to be found.  The object looked exactly like a giant star.   I heard no sounds from it.;28.6840999999993;-81.2811999999985
White light, high up, no sound.;2015-02-10 21:15:00;2 minutes;White Light, High Up, No Sound Saw a white light moving in the sky.  It was really, really high up, like a plane would fly, but we don't normally have planes flying in that direction at night, and usually they are much lower.   I saw the light and ran into the house to get my night vision camera and was able to catch a few seconds of it on video.  It was moving at a steady pace, and I heard no sound at all.   I live in a flight traffic area and ALWAYS hear planes when they go over, there was no sound from this. It was moving from the north to the south.  Saw no blinking lights.  Even the video doesn't show blinking lights.   Thought it might be a satellite or the ISS, but when I went online to find the current positions of all of them nothing matched the location of what I saw over central Florida.  The object never changed direction, never changed speed, just kept on a steady course.;28.6840999999993;-81.2811999999985
Multiple round orange lights traveling horizontally East to West at low altitude.;2017-09-07 20:26:00;5 minutes;Multiple round orange lights traveling horizontally, East to West, at low altitude. I saw a few strange orange lights outside my window.  I live near Orlando International Airport so several planes fly overhead every hour, these lights did not look at all like planes or helicopters.  A plane will have a red light on the left wingtip, a green light on the right wingtip, and a strobe light in the center.   This was a solid orange light, there were several of them traveling from East to West, and they appeared to be at relatively low altitude.  There were also planes in the sky at the time and these lights were drastically different, they sort of looked like flares but were traveling completely horizontally.   When one passed particularly close I thought it sounded like a rocket engine but it could have been the sound of a jet passing overhead.   A buddy of mine saw them outside his house about 15 minutes later he lives nearby and also saw the orange lights traveling horizontally East to West.
