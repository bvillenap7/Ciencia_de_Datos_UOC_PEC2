Orange sphere appeared, turned, blinked, then faded away into the distance;2004-03-12 00:45:00;90 seconds approx.;Orange sphere appeared, turned, blinked, then faded away into the distance my girlfriend pointed it out and it looked like a round orange sphere, what you might think a meteor would look like moving into the atmosphere at a very low speed, no tail. the sphere moved very slow and made a U shaped turn after which it faded away slowly over 10 seconds and then when it completely dissapeard it blinked bright orange one more time then vanished. 15 seconds later it reappeared but looked dim like a star, no longer orange colored. But we knew it wasn't a star because it was moving until it disappeared past the roof of an adjacent apartment building. It did however, look as if it was still moving away. There was no noise or sound. As I said we thought it was a meteor entering the atmosphere till it began turning then blinked, then moved away.;28.6840999999993;-81.2811999999985
