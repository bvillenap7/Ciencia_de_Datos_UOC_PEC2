At 8:30 this morning at my house, something caught my eye in the sky to the East.  It is difficult to estimate the height and location of the object, but I estimate it was centered over Winter Springs, Florida at a height that was a little higher than you would typically see a helicopter.  The object was likely Frisbee shaped, but I believe I was just seeing it from the side which I would describe as Cigar shaped.  My first thought was that it was a drone, but it was moving too quickly and effortlessly.  It went from the original location to the left and hovered, then to the right and hovered, and then up higher to hover.  The changes in location were split second, not gradual changes.  The object seemed to be lit up with a white light that covered its entire shape.  Based on how white the light was and that it didn’t seem like a glare, my guess is that it was a light coming from the object and not the sun’s reflection.  I was able to track the minor movemen! ts for about a minute before the object proceeded East at a speed that disappeared from view within a moment.  It is a sunny day here with some clouds in the sky, but no weather conditions can explain what I saw.  This is my first time in seeing something like this, and I want to know if anyone else has seen this object in my area.;28.6840999999993;-81.2811999999985
