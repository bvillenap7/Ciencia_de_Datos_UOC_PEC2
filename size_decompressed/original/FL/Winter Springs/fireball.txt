6-8 orange and red lights seen in a somewhat horizontal alignment.;2014-12-19 21:20:00;5 minutes;6-8 orange and red lights seen in a somewhat horizontal alignment. I would like to report what may, or may not, have been a UFO sighting.   Some time between 9:15pm and 9:30pm, on December 19, 2014, I saw maybe 6 to 8 orange and red lights hovering in one place in the sky.  They were approximately over Dike Road and Tuskawilla Road in Winter Springs, Florida, but to be honest I could not tell exactly the location since I was driving.   I live near an airport, and I saw some planes fly somewhat close to the lights and thought maybe they would have reported them as well.   They were, as I said before, hovering in one place.  Their alignment was horizontal, but scattered, as in they did not make a straight line.  I wanted to turn around and see them again, but when I went back they were all gone.  I am not sure if this matters, but it got very cloudy after the event. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Single orange fireball with trail traveling northeast to southeast.;2015-01-01 20:00:00;20 seconds;single orange fireball with trail traveling northeast to southeast Something caught my eye while sitting on the couch.  When I looked over I saw a single orange looking fireball with an orange trail taveling fairly quickly going northeast to southeast.  Not super fast, but not slow either.  It looked like what I would expect a rocket launch might look like but it was traveling across the sky not up from the ground.  It also looked to be at a high altitude.   It traveled across the sky and disappeared behind clouds after 20 seconds or so.;28.6840999999993;-81.2811999999985
Glowing, sputtering fireball moving slowly east to west near MCO - Orlando International Airport.;2016-05-09 11:50:00;15 minutes;Glowing, sputtering fireball moving slowly east to west near MCO - Orlando International Airport. Was walking the dog - skies are crystal clear blue, looked south toward MCO and saw a flying object glowing and sputtering - red, brilliant orange, then out.  No pattern other than the color.  No form, no shape.  Headed west.   Checked the flight tracker, the only thing I saw on the same course was a Cessna, about 2k feet up.  This was either way higher or way smaller.  Jet engine fire?  Satellite falling back to earth slowly - uncontrolled?  I've never seen anything like it in my whole life.   I've seen aircraft reflect the strong Florida sun before, but this was not only much more brilliant, but stayed brilliant as it moved east to west of me.  If it was a reflection, I'd have passed out of it's beam.  It reminded me of the flame that the Space Shuttle SRB's emit - brilliant orange, only this wasn't as bright or as constant.  Very bright, but sputtering.;28.6840999999993;-81.2811999999985
