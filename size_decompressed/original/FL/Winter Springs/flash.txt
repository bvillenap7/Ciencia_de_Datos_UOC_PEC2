Red lights mixed with yellow were flashing on and off.  They seemed stationary in the air for a while, one at a time disappeared.   My first thought was that helicopters were flying in formation with flashing Christmas lights. (Because it's Christmas time.)  Then I realized one at a time was becoming invisible.  So the helicopter theory went out the window.   A car drove up to us and asked us, are they UFO's.  We said I think so.  They said yeah, they are UFO's.  Then one UFO remained visible and bright.  Finally it disappeared too.   Hardly anyone noticed except for the guys in the car that called out to us. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
