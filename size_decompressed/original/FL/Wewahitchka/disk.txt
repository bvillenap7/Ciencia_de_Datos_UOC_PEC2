I was waiting in my car in my boyfriends yard when I saw a bright light about 25-50 yards in front of me hoovering over a barn. I got down in the floor of my car. It just sat there, I didn't hear anything. It scared me but at the same time I wanted to look at it. I don't remember it doing anything. I can't remember seeing the top of it but it was real bright around the underside of it. It just stayed in one place for about 5-10 minutes and then it made a slight move upward to leave and it was gone. I don't mean it slowly left, I mean it was gone. I told a few friends who laughed at me so I never told anyone until about 25 years later and mentioned it to my then boyfriends mom. She turned pale. I thought she was going to laugh at me but she said she had seen it to and had never said anything to anyone. I wish I had talked more about it back then because I keep feeling like I forgot alot about it by supressing it. I wonder if hypnosis would help me remember. OK, so you want to know if I'm a nut. I don't feel that way. I was a student either a senior in high school or just out. You would think that I would have that date engraved in my memory but I don't. I do remember exactly where I was when JFK got shot, Elvis died and both of our space shuttles went down but I can't tell you the dates of them either. I have been a nurse for 27 years and my boyfriends mom is still a practicing nurse today at age 79. I KNOW what I saw!!  They are out there somewhere. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
