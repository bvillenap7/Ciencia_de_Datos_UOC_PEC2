Green object falling but not as fast as a shooting star;2003-11-11 19:50:00;4-5 seconds;Green object falling but not as fast as a shooting star It started all of a sudden and was falling, like a falling star but not as fast. It definitely had a green color to it but didn't seem to have a tail or anything. It was big and did not seem to get smaller as it went down.It lasted about 4-5 seconds before going out of my view behind some trees. I would estimate that it was about 10 - 15 miles away. I live near Tyndall AFB and called our local sherrif dept. to report. They called the Coast Guard who called me back and questioned me. They were going to check with Tyndall and see if they had anything going on, he did say that the green color was unusual for flares. Of course, I'm sure there will be a good explanation for this as usual!!;30.0926;-85.2001
