There was a large bright red shape in the sky above the tree line. This object was bright red and seemed to get hotter looking (more red) and increased some in size, then it decreased and went away. Within seconds a white shooting star?? came from the area the red light had been and disappeared from my view (lower than tree level). We have some red towers in Wewa but this was much higher and larger than the towers. I called Tyndall AFB in Panama City to see if they had any planes up in case one had a problem and spoke with 2 different people. The first one wanted to know if it was santa claus, and the second one did not show much more interest other than say they did not have any planes up. I am guessing they did not take me seriously.;30.0926;-85.2001
