claw hand appears after using scanner on computer;2003-08-18 20:00:00;1min;claw hand appears after using scanner on computer on 8-18-03 my husband was using our scanner to scan in a pewter item to sell on ebay and after the scanner was done scanning this hand showed up. this is not my hand nor it is my husbands hand no one else lives with us. i am not a jokester or prankster, but hold a masters degree and was a teacher. We used to live in the /Albany NY area until 2 years ago. Nothing like this happened before or after, however, we have had some odd things that happened since then in our home which deny explaination. No one was touching the scanner at the time this machine was on or after it was done scanning. this frightened myself and my husband very much. i would like an explaination as to what this thing was and why it did this on my scanner. thank you ((NUFORC Note:  We doubt that the claw is an alien extremity.  It looks like a human hand, including fingernails, which has been refracted by the lens system in the scanner.  PD));28.3160082872928;-80.7292005524861
