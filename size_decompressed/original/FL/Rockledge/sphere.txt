Sphere shape object seen over space coast florida leaving smoke circle trail as it shots straight up out of sight;2009-02-23 15:40:00;2 minutes;sphere shape object seen over space coast florida leaving smoke circle trail as it shots straight up out of sight I was driving in Rockledge, Florida towards I-95 as I looked out of the window I saw a silver round metallic object go over the top of us.  It came to a sudden stop just over I-95 near Fiske blvd. It hovered for a second, then proceeded to do a circular motion at a high rate of speed. At this time you could barely make out the silver as it was moving so fast. This movement created a cloud/smoke-like ring where the object was moving.  The center was clear and you could see the sky. The object abruptly stopped in the center.  There was then a flash, like that of a camera, and then the object shot straight up in the sky.  The object moved so fast that it was not visible within seconds. All that was left was the cloud/smoke-like formation in the sky. This all happened so fast that by the time I had my camera phone ready all that I caught was the formation that was left.  This happened in daylight with many people around.  I have never put the photos out before. I ! never really knew what to do with my information, until I saw a recent episode of the Cape Canaveral/Florida area that your show did.;28.3160082872928;-80.7292005524861
2 UFO bright white sphere disc crafts seen over Rockledge Fl by mother and adult son.;2014-04-11 19:27:00;2-3 minutes;2 UFO bright white sphere disc crafts seen over Rockledge Fl by mother and adult son. The objects were bright white color, disc sphere shape moving at high rate of  speed crossing from southward to moving toward east within seconds as in a blink of an eye.   The first one observed was in the south sky and moved eastward to joined one in the east sky.  It moved at a high rate of speed as in a blink of your eye once it was south then it was east.    We observed the two make rapid maneuvers around each other that no known aircraft can make.  They were at least 30-40,000 feet in the sky.   Then one of the craft stop moving as in hovering and the second craft move southeast and upward slowly.   Within a second the first craft that was hovering began to move slowly toward the second craft.   At it met the second craft, the two crafts shot upward very rapidly and then just disappeared.   They made no sound while in flight nor made any sonorant boom as they disappeared.   This was observed by myself age 53 yrs old and my son age 29 yrs old.   This is the 3rd time I have seen them and the first time for my son. Everyone including this son thought I was crazy before.   Now I have my son who has seen it too.;28.3160082872928;-80.7292005524861
