Minutes later a girl saw us watching the sky and showed us a video of the first orb that passed over, but I dont think she saw the two that came just a little later (she got back into her car). Unlike anything I have ever seen, no trail, no noise and appeared to have unbridled speed, although they all went about the same speed across the sky on a very clear night.;28.3160082872928;-80.7292005524861
