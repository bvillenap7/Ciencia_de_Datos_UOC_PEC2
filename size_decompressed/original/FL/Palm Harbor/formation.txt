12 lights take 4 seconds to cross night sky without sound in V formation just above clouds headed north over Palm Harbor, FL.;2014-03-21 21:05:00;4 seconds;12 lights take 4 seconds to cross night sky without sound in V formation just above clouds headed north over Palm Harbor, FL I was out walking the dog, when I just happened to look up at the exact right time to see a large V formation of lights flying almost right over me.  Flying from south to north, it was just above the clouds which were lit up by the full moon tonight.  But if I hadn't looked at the exact spot that it came from, I would never have seen it fly over.  No sound whatsoever, just lights.  I couldn't see a shape of the vessel behind the lights.  It appeared to be translucent.  It appeared to have approximately 5 lights on each side of the V formation. Either it was one large vessel or several balls of light flying in a super tight formation.  In about 4 seconds it went from horizon to horizon.  I watch airline jets fly over every night and they take 15 seconds or more to go from horizon to horizon.  I have an oak tree in my yard and I saw it for about 2 seconds as it flew in my direction, then lost a second as it flew over the oak tree.  Then I saw the formation for about one! second as it flew past the oak tree and out of sight.;28.079349269131;-82.7360883061054
