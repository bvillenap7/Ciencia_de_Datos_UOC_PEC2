From behind my roof I see a formation of 4 lights emerge,  I thought initially it was a plane.  But it moved too quickly to be a plane, as within seconds, it seemed to make around a 75 degrees arc possibly, before fading.  It did not go behind trees or under the horizon, just faded into the sky.  Although I tried to divert the attention of my friends to the object, it disappeared before they saw it.;28.079349269131;-82.7360883061054
