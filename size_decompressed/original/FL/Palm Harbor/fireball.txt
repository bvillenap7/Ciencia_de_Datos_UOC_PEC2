((HOAX??))  Fireball in sky.;2012-06-30 17:20:00;2 minutes;Fireball in sky. There was a huge fireball in the sky.  It came from the west and headed east.  The object seemed very close above our heads, about same height as a traffic helicopter, didn't have to strain our eyes.  It was quiet, but I did hear a sound as it went over my head and it sounded like a small roasting fire.  It went straight, didn't take any turns or anything and then it went out of sight.
