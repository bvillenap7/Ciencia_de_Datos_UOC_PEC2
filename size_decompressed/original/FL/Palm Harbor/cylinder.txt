It also had 2 purple spots on the bottom of the object (engines?) made no sound at all. my friend saw the same. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides only e-address.

Slow moving large, white cylinder observed during morning commute, reflecting brightly in sun.;2012-04-17 07:30:00;5 minutes;Slow moving large, white cylinder observed during morning commute, reflecting brightly in sun. I pulled up to a line of cars in morning traffic at a stoplight and, as I had the sunroof open, immediately observed a slow-moving blue and white cylinder about 2000-5000 feet in the air.   As the sun had just come up, it was reflecting off the white surface of the cylinder very brightly, which caught my attention.  I mean, if any of the hundreds of people in traffic DIDN'T see it, it would be a miracle.  I would estimate it's speed at approximately 40mph, as I had it in view the entire time I was stopped.  I'd estimate it's size as 50-70 feet in length.  Imagine a dry-erase board marker with caps on each end, that's what it looked like.   I got a picture of it on my cellphone just before traffic started, but it's a bit distant.   I'm familiar with all types of aircraft, military and civilian, it was not that.  It was not a lighter than air vehicle that I've ever seen.  Let me know and I can forward the photo I took.;28.079349269131;-82.7360883061054
