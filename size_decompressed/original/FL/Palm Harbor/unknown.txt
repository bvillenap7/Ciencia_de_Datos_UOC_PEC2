Strange starlike object seen in southwestern florida sky, with dim object directly beneath.;2013-10-17 08:17:00;~45 minutes;Strange starlike object seen in southwestern florida sky, with dim object directly beneath. A bright, star-like object was seen in the southwestern sky in Palm Harbor, Florida.  A small reddish star-like object was directly underneath it.  This object has been seen in the same spot for two nights in a row.  Neither of them move, they are both stationary. The color of the object is white with a sort of greenish-bluish glow and the object beneath has an orangish glow to it.  The white object is brighter than a planet and the red object is dim. It is very strange as it does not appear to go away.;28.079349269131;-82.7360883061054
I saw 2 pearlescent-yellow/orange lights traveling together like helicopters but without the noise.  ((anonymous report));2019-05-20 23:40:00;3 minutes;I saw 2 pearlescent-yellow/orange lights traveling together like helicopters but without the noise. I went to let the dogs outside before going to bed.  The moon was full & bright in the eastern sky and when I turned and looked in the western sky, I thought I saw 2 planes coming, but realized they were not flashing lights like a plane does, and had a very pearlescent or yellowish glow that you donâ€™t see on regular planes.  They moved quickly through the sky but stayed in formation with each other and the thing that struck me most strange, was how quiet it was.

Two orange lights on each end.;2019-08-27 20:30:00;30 seconds;Two orange lights on each end. Equally compared to the elevation and speed that a helicopter flies. There was absolutely no audible sound. It appeared invisible although it blocked out some stars as it traveled southward. There were 2 orange lights. One on each end. The lights were small and dimly lit.;28.079349269131;-82.7360883061054
