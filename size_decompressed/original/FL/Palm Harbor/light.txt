Reappeared later, then disappeared. This evening around midnight I was floating around on a raft in my pool, just staring into the sky. While I was stargazing afloat, I was trying to remember constellations, and looking to see if any planets were visible, which is something I haven't done for years.  At around 12:15 I noticed a ''star'' I thought was different. At first glance I thought there was a good chance it was Venus. I have no idea what planets are visible right now. I began looking at other stars, but I always came back to check on the planet-star. Until about 12:20, after looking around the sky, I turned my head back to check on the planet star and no more than 2 seconds after I got it back in my sight, it shot off in a direct angle downward, and disappeared.  This immediately made me jump up, and lose my raft. After looking around in desperation to find where it had gone, and also to make sure I was just seeing things, I saw a light in a spot in the sky where I hadn't remembered seeing one. It was the exact same size and brightness, and color (white light gleaming with a slight green). When I got out of the pool to look at it, it was gone and I could not see it at all in the sky. I live in western Florida, and was facing the northwestern sky when I had this sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness intended to state that the sighting occurred Thursday morning, July 14.  We have amended the date above.  The witness provided no contact information, so we are unable to contact him.  PD));28.079349269131;-82.7360883061054

Huge bright green/blue ball light travel through the sky.;2013-12-13 19:08:00;15 seconds;Huge bright green/blue ball light travel through the sky I was looking west towards the water and I saw a big bright blue-green ball light. It seemed like it was going down towards the water but it went out of my sight.  The bright green light had a white trail and lit up small portions of the sky around it.  It went by very fast.  I Thought of it as a shooting star, but 15 seconds is a long time for something so fast to travel like that.

Blue green object then changed to bright white, making U-shapes.;2015-07-17 23:00:00;2 minutes;Blue green object then changed to bright white, making U-shapes We were sitting on our porch and saw a blue green light coming towards us.  It made a fast U shape and froze, then it turned towards us and was an extremely bright white light. It stayed frozen for about 45 seconds it seemed as if time had stopped and we were both focused on this object then did a few more quick U shapes and went downwards out of sight.  I have seen two others before but this one seemed to last the longest and did the fasted maneuvers.  It was incredible.

T;2016-08-23 21:00:00;10-12 minutes;On the night of Aug 23, at around 9 to 9:30pm, I observed a group of about 20 orange/red Lights traveling from west to east in the sky.  The lights were globular and maybe the size of a basketball.   They were moving slowly in a staggered single file formation.   All appeared to be at about 500 ft elevation just south of my location and all were traveling in the same line, at the same speed.   They were silent. I watched this phenomenon for about ten minutes, or so, from a location on the Tarpon Springs, Palm Harbor town line, about one half mile from the Gulf.;28.079349269131;-82.7360883061054

I then realized that the object was moving, slowly, directly upward. The object was regularly pulsating, changing it's brightness.  After about a minute it changed direction at what appeared to be a right angle, and continued going until it was no longer visible.  I was able to get a couple pictures and about 30 seconds of video.;28.079349269131;-82.7360883061054
