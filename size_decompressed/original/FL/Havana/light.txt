Bright white light streak over Gadsden Co. Fl made sharp left turn.;2002-02-14 06:35:00;1-2 seconds;Bright white light streak over Gadsden Co. Fl made sharp left turn. While approaching US27 from the east on a dirt road, I saw a streak of very bright white light in the west. It was traveling from the vicinity of Tallahassee in a northern direction at a very high rate of speed. It was dawn and there were no stars visible at that time of the morning. The streak lasted for a second or two. It had a very bright point followed by a trail of light. It streaked across the sky, then made a sudden  90 degree turn to the left. At first, I thought it was a meteor, but then realized that a meteor can't turn suddenly. There were no street lights or other cars on the dirt road to cause a reflection in my windshield.;30.6088;-84.4193
