My husband and I were coming home from his company’s Christmas Party and we saw something odd in the sky. The lights looked like headlights of a semi truck, but in the sky hovering. As we drove closer it moved fast across the street over a sod farm and stopped and hovered again. We pulled off of the side of the road and rolled the windows down to see if we could hear anything. We heard a “whoosh” type of sound. It wasn’t too loud. I attempted to take a photograph, which of course didn’t turn out, but when my flash fired the lighting of the craft changed. That scared us and we left quickly.;30.6088;-84.4193
