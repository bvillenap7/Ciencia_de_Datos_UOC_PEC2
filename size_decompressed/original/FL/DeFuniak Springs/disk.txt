Two orange orb-lights under disc-shaped object;2010-03-18 20:15:00;3 minutes;Two orange orb-lights under disc-shaped object Approximately 8:15 pm, my friend and I were on Walton Rd. heading West when we saw two orange lights to the South.  A faintly visible shape was behind the lights, perhaps disc-shaped, moving steadily West.  We pulled into the student parking lot of Walton High School and exited the vehicle.  At this time we noticed that there was now only one light.  We hurried toward the stadium to see it better, whereupon the object slowly moved into a lone set of cloud cover.  We could see the single light shining and flickering in the cloud.  I ran to get my camera from the car and my friend announced the object had disappeared.  He stated it flickered and dimmed and then disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));30.8107117318436;-86.176100558659
