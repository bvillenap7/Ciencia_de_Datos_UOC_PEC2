Six flickering orange lights over baker;2010-01-01 00:45:00;15;Six flickering orange lights over baker My brother and I were driving our cousin home.  As we were about to turn we saw a pyramid made up of six orange flickering lights.   We stopped and watched as they faded.  Once we dropped him off at his house we.asked his dad if he saw them, he said no.   Then later when we got home we asked our mom and she said the same.  The next day it was Luke no one saw them, so I put it in the back of my mind trying to forget but now I found someone else who saw them.
