I was in the middle of the woods camping with some friends.  My friends were looking at the fire and I was looking across the fire at the trees when through a gap in the trees (which in daylight the gap was at around 30 feet) I saw an orange light which was sitting still as soon as I saw the light it accelerated (did not fall!) toward the ground at an unknown speed.  I asked if anyone else had seen the light which no one else was looking in the direction at the moment.  Never saw the light again after staying up all night watching for it.;29.9498625;-82.1279625
