Silent glowing fireball moved slowly (at first) in straight line.;2013-07-04 22:30:00;3 minutes;Silent glowing fireball moved slowly (at first) in straight line. A ball of fire in the sky caught my attention and at first glance I thought it was a flaming ember from a firework but quickly realized it was not falling and definitely not an ember.  We watched it move slowly (at first) in a straight line from east to west, debating the whole time what it could be.  Being cloudy/overcast that night, we thought it must be a helicopter but it got closer and was completely silent.  At its closest it looked more saucer shaped (flat on the bottom with the glow/fire/light emminating upwards).  It moved so slowly and seemed so close overhead (but it was hazy).  I went inside to tell others & get a camera but quickly returned to see it had moved away considerably faster than it had approached and it was barely visible to those who hadn't seen it for the duration.  It appeared to be gaining altitude and moving quickly to the west/northwest and disappeared from my view.  The light/fire was strange because the color varied/moved as a! fire would but appeared to be contained in a ball (or dome shape when it was closest) yet the ball was not clearly defined.  The edges looked &quothazy&quot.;28.1907010638297;-82.7493680851064
Bright orange fireball going very fast and no sound.;2013-07-05 22:00:00;1 minute;Bright orange fireball going very fast and no sound. Tonight July 5, 2013 at around 9:50pm to 10pm, my husband and I were taking a walk down our street, when I noticed a bright orange light, irregular in shape, like a fire ball in the sky coming from the east. At first I thought it was a fire work shooting up, but it kept on coming very fast over our heads, in a north-west pattern headed over the Gulf of Mexico.  It seemed like it was going very fast and it didn’t make any noise. There were no other planes around at the time that we noticed we watched it until it went over the trees.  We did try taking a picture of it with our cell phone, but it didn’t come out very well, due to the fact it was going so fast.;28.1907010638297;-82.7493680851064

Giant fireball over canal in holiday, Florida;2015-07-21 22:00:00;1:30 seconds;Giant fireball over canal in holiday, Florida Red/orange, glowing, fireball floating quietly 200-300 ft in the sky.  Flying south to north, slowly, and suddenly began flying east, fastly.  It looked almost like a giant sky lantern that was burning out of control, but quickly realized it was changing direction and couldn't have been a balloon, there was no wind.  My girlfriend and I thought it was a helicopter that was burning out of control, but we didn't hear rotars.  We live near tampa and Clearwater airport and see a lot of air traffic, including helicopters, and are used to all types of aircraft sounds. This was flying too low and made no sound whatsoever.  Even more interesting, just before we saw the fire all we both saw a very bright star in the Scorpio constellation which began to slowly ascend higher into the sky until it disappeared.  I said, do you see that? Pointing at the bright star.  She yelled, WHAT IS THAT?!  Pointing at the fireball, which was floating quietly over the canal next to our home.  We observed for a total of 1.5 minutes.  There were intermittent, fog-like clouds flying by over head.  But the fireball was below the fog.   I am a prior service army veteran who was stationed with 1st cavalry division's air cavalry brigade, from 2006-2008, and have much experience with helicopters.  The size of the craft, if you extend your hand out and close one eye, was about the size of a quarter.;28.1907010638297;-82.7493680851064

After a few seconds, the one in the front disappeared then the next one and finally the last. That's it. I don't know if this means anything but I've noticed an increase in airplane traffic in my area, I've lived here 7 years, and its never been the way it is now.;28.1907010638297;-82.7493680851064
