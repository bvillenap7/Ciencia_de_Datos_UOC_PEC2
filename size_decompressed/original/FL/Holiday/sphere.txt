Reddish orange orb sighted moving east to west over Pasco County, Florida.;2018-07-04 22:00:00;2 minutes;Reddish orange orb sighted moving east to west over Pasco County Florida My wife and I were outside watching the neighborhood fireworks all around us when I noticed a reddish orange orb in the east sky. The object was moving from east to west across the sky. As it made it’s way over the Gulf of Mexico, the object appeared to have stopped for about 30 seconds and then disappeared. There was no sound, there were no blinking lights, just a fully illuminated reddish orange orb. As it was the Fourth of July,  I’m sure there must be many people who were looking in the sky last night and must have witnessed this orb.;28.1907010638297;-82.7493680851064
