Strange Bright Orange Fiery Glow over Tarpon Springs area.;2015-08-22 23:40:00;2-3 minutes;Strange Bright Orange Fiery Glow over Tarpon Springs area. Bright glowing orange light seemed to be at the base of this craft.  It seemed to be getting closer to me, but then I noticed it was actually moving upwards in a slight zig zag pattern.  There was a fog like cloud above it and it disappeared into this cloud. It made no sound and had no other lights like an airplane would.  I waited for it to reappear from the clouds but after 5 mins of waiting it did not.   This is the same place I noticed the same object about a week ago, but dismissed it as someone shooting off a left over firework rocket.;28.1907010638297;-82.7493680851064
