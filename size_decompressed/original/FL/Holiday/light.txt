Photographic anomaly;2004-11-18 05:50:00;20 minutes;Photographic anomaly My dad wakes up at 5:45am for work.  He woke me up to remind me of the meteor shower.  I got outside but it was cold.  Right before I got back into the house I saw something.  I was looking East-South-East about 20 degrees over the horizon.  I looked like a very bright star.  But the more I looked at it the stranger it appeared.  It was far too bright for a star.  It was mostly yellow and was glittering hard.  Sometimes it turned purplish.  So I thought it was a helicopter or an airplane.  But after waiting 20 minutes I noticed it wasn't moving.  I went inside and took a picture of the light with my digital camera.  And went back inside to sleep and thought nothing of it.  The next day I left for a vacation and didn't get home till the 21st.  I uploaded the pictures from my camera to my computer and was struck by the UFO picture.  I just looks weird.  I made a previous UFO report on this website.  After that bizarre sighting I've been taking a second glance every time I look up in the sky.  And again I'd like to clarify my opinion of the sighting.  It's merely an unidentified flying object, not a space craft piloted by ghosts or whatever.;28.1907010638297;-82.7493680851064

UFO with bright red light on the right and bright green light zooming from point to point and then hovering.;2013-08-21 22:00:00;10-15 minutes;UFO with bright red light on the right and bright green light zooming from point to point and then hovering. On 08/21/2013 at approximately 10:00 pm my husband and I were sitting on our upstairs porch which is screened.  We looked up  to the sky and saw what looked to be an object that consisted of a bright red light on the right and a  bright green light on the left.  When we first sighted it, the object seem to be flying toward us but turned and zoomed off in another direction.  When the object first appeared, it seemed to be no more than 250-300 yards and a height that was not more than 50-100 foot above the tree line.  The object was definately being manuvered or driven by someone or something.  It darted and zoomed to a spot and then would stop and just hover.  I have never seen aircraft that would typically fly like this one.  It could raise itself straight up or down make turns easily and zoom to the next location.  When we last saw it, my husband said that it looked like it had slowly gone straight down behind a group of trees.  I did get a picture of it and were able to enhance it so you can clearly see  what we were seeing with the naked eye.;28.1907010638297;-82.7493680851064
Bright light hovering back and forth in the sky instantly disappeared.;2015-05-01 21:05:00;hour;Bright light hovering back and forth in the sky instantly disappeared. We were all sitting out there noticing a bright light in between two stars... the light seemed to shift back and forth and seem to get brighter and dimmer, it stayed in the sky for about an hour in the same spot. We looked away and looked back up and it instantly was gone. Also would like to mention looking through the report database, there is something coinciding with the month of July.  Seems to be when the most sightings are reported;28.1907010638297;-82.7493680851064
Flashing circular objects moving.;2016-08-24 00:00:00;Hours;Flashing circular objects moving. My boyfriend and I noticed these events taking place about a week ago. We were out at 1 am and saw red white green and blue lights flashing in one spot in the sky.  We watched it for 30 minutes and it hadn't moved, we checked out the rest of the sky and spotted two more of the same object some of them had moved!  We were sitting in the same unmoved position, yet they were not.  At first we thought maybe a twinkling star. The next few nights we sat outside ..  To see if they were visible still.  Every night the number and placement was different.  We wanted to catch it while it was moving!  Last night is when I knew for a fact it wasn't stars.  There was only one last night and it was closer than usual however not close enough to see the exact shape.  Although the lights that flash red white yellow green and blue seemed to blur to the right and back a little giving the effect that the object had a sort of roundness to it and the lights go round and round.  Sometimes just blinking.  We watched it while trying to get our iPhones out but of course it just app! ears as a dot of a light switching colors.  Then finally we witness what we wanted, it was moving. Up very slowly, it went higher and higher stopping many times in between then it darted to the right and stayed put again.  What else could possibly move this way?!?;28.1907010638297;-82.7493680851064

A stream of approximately 40 star-like objects flying in the same direction.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-22 05:45:00;15 mins;A stream of approximately 40 star-like objects flying in the same direction over a 15 minute period of time. On 11/22/2019 at approximately 5:45AM EST, in Holiday, Florida (NW of Tampa, North of St. Petersburg), I was letting the dogs out and looking at the sky to try to see a meteor. I saw one star-like light flying constant in one direction (from SSW to NNE). I thought, “Oh nice, a satellite!!” Then I saw another. Then another. One after another. At first it was just one at a time in the sky, heading in the same direction. I went over to my husband’s truck to kiss him goodbye. Then I looked back up and there were about 10 of them flying in the same direction, in a line (not a perfect line but close). Two of them were flying SO CLOSE. Then MORE started coming. The highest count I got at one time was 17 flying in one line in the sky at the same time. Then 14 all together. Sometimes two were flying together. They all looked like faint stars, not bright like planets. I ran inside to get the binoculars. They still just looked like stars through the binoculars. Around ! 6:00 is when it finally stopped. The last one I saw was heading from east to west. That was the only one I saw flying in that direction. I am a constant sky watcher. I know what planes look like as we have at least 3 airports and MacDill AFB in the Tampa area. I live approximately 1km from the Gulf of Mexico and it appeared to me that these were coming out of the sky over the Gulf. They were appearing out of nowhere from the same spot. Perhaps, the angle they were coming from just made it look like they were appearing out of nowhere. I don’t know. Just trying to make sense of this amazing event I witnessed. The whole event lasted approximately 15-20 minutes.;28.1907010638297;-82.7493680851064
