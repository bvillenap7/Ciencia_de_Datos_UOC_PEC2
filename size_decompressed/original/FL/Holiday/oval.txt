Orange fire ball in the night sky;2012-03-17 00:15:00;15 mins;Orange fire ball in the night sky The shape of the first item was oval, orange flaming.  It moved silently in the Southwest sky, it was going through the sky and at moderate pace and appeared to be going in a circle, we say circle because after it disappear about five minutes later either the same one came around again or a new one appeared.  Going the same pace in the sky and had the same orange glow. We were amazed at the fact that it had no sound, looked orange and was moving like it was flying not falling.  On a side note, they are showing Crystal Skulls for a one day showing about five miles from here, we thought we would mention it only because it was a strange thing to see the day before the viewing was open to the public and the skulls have been linked to UFOâ€™s. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the correct date is March 17.  PD));28.1907010638297;-82.7493680851064
