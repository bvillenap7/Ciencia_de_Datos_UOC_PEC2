I was driving north towards Holiday on Anclote Rd. (not far from the Anclote Power Plant) when I saw 3 solid green lights (taking up a vast amount of sky and forming a triangle) enter my view of the night sky.  They were moving to the right, (north east) yet flying at the same speed and maintaining the same triangular shape.  What captured my curiosity was that directly behind them and flying in the same direction was an airplane with flashing lights, however this plane was larger than the 3 green lights and obviously a plane.  It looked like it was following the other objects. I watched the green lights travel across the sky together and at first I thought it was one solid object (in that case it would have been enormous triangular object) however as soon as I screamed out “What is that?!” one of the three green lights (the bottom left) started flashing red and white lights, as the other two green lights and flashing airplane remained the same and moved beyond! the tree line to where I could no longer see them.  Then, this once green object with the now flashing lights abruptly changed directions and started flying back to the west. It was very confusing and I remember thinking, what are they doing?  I wasn’t sure what to make of this, maybe it’s nothing but I haven’t seen anything like that before.  I thought it was interesting and wanted to share what I saw!;28.1907010638297;-82.7493680851064
