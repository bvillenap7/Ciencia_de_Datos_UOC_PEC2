Small spinning object encased in a glowing white cloud;2004-06-30 16:00:00;2 minutes;Small spinning object encased in a glowing white cloud One day I was walking south on the westside of a bridge when I saw a small fuzzy cloud in the cloudless sunny sky over the Gulf of Mexico.  It was moving down directly towards me very fast. When it got close I could jus barely make aout  dark can shape inside it.  The cloud itself glowed a bright white and had a ruffly square shape. When the object reached the bridge it was about 5 feet above the river, it was heading under the bridge but it bouncedaway to the south like it had hit an invisible wall. It circledaround and tried again many times. Then it circledin the air for a while at the side of the bridge hitting the concrete bridge supor and a small tree many times. The center of the bridge is steel. It dropped to water level three times making three cropl circles, about 20 feet accross, each one took about 3 seconds and make a loud sound like a weed whacker louder than an ai boat. The soud it made when it hit the concrete was a buffing sound. Itwent up into the sky to  the same direction it came from weave as it went. I am late making this report because I am late to buy a computer, I did not know where to report it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

A small square cloud came down, bounced off a wal,l made 3 crop circles and went into the sky;2004-06-30 16:00:00;2 minutes;A small square cloud came down, bounced off a wal,l made 3 crop circles and went into the sky While walking across a bridge, going, south on the west side of US-Highway 19, I noticed a small glowing cloud high in the sky to the west moving down and towards me.  It went down far enough to go under the bridge but when it got within less than 20 feet of the bridge it bounced to the south and hit the concrete bridge support on the south side bouncing off, it came around in a circle several times repeating this bouncing many times.   Then it stayed in that small area going in a circle and bouncing off the concrete for a while and several times hitting a small tree about two feet out from he bridge.   Then it dropped into the swamp grass and made three crop circles about 20 feet across, it went up and down, staying down in the grass about 3 seconds at a time then going up about 1 foot above the grass. Then the cloud suddenly just rose up and went up to the west where it came from until it was too far to see. The cloud glowed bright white and was about 2 feet wide and it looked square.  There was an outline of something inside barley visible.  The only time it make a sound was when it touched something.  While down in the grass it made a loud sound like a weed whacker.

An exploding star up in the sky over West central Florida.;2010-06-25 04:51:00;3 minutes;An exploding star up in the sky over West central Florida. It was 4:51 a.m. today, June 25th, 2010 and I saw what looked like a star up in the sky and was looking at it for 2-3 minutes.  I noticed it started to have a ring around it and it looked like a 4th of July firework and exploded around it.  It then disappeared soon after that.   I just had to document this somehow!;28.1907010638297;-82.7493680851064

There aren't any other reporting sites to my knowledge, and surely we should document truth and experiences.  it behaved like an orb.  shot up and disappeared.  it came out of another dimension for sure because i seen it with my very own eyes.;28.1907010638297;-82.7493680851064
