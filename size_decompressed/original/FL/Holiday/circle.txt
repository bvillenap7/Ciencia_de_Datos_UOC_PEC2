It does not flicker like all the other planets and stars.  I bumped my telescope a little and i saw an outline of a massive planet beyond venus.  It was black and all i could see was the outer edges.  This planet was so big i had to move my telescope around to see the whole thing.  I am very surprised nobody else has reported this. The planet was at least 10 times the size of the sun and i doubt it it belonged to our solar system.  I have been looking for it since but it has been cloudy so i have had zero success.  I want to know what is going on with venus.  I want to know what that black planet is.  I see strange things in the sky on a regular basis.  I also have one thatappears on my canera like a plane but it turns and start getting brighter then it backs up and goes out the way it came in.  No plane does that.  Or helicopter.;28.1907010638297;-82.7493680851064
