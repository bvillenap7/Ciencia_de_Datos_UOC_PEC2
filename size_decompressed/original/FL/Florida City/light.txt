Big bright light over Florida city U.S.A;2012-03-24 22:35:00;45 min,maybe more;Big bright light over florida city U.S.A I was going towards my home in my wheelchair ( I'm paraplegic) and I saw this big light above,maybe it was a planet ( I don't know much about planetary positioning). The thing is,it was so big and bright that I could even see it by the corner of my eye. There were some people outside,but they didn't care much about it. Also,one of the bright spikes of light was longer at the top it was a static( or it seemed static) big bright light and the sky was clear. Not more to add,( some weird stuff in Florida sky nowadays) Note: I wasn't drunk or anything like that No pictures,I got a cheap phone with low definition camera Thank you for having this site available for comments and reports;25.7738;-80.3584
