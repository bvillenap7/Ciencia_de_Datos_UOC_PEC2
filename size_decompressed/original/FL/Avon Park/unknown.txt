Our house sets at the corner of N.Lake Ave and Jackson and the way our bed room faces we look out into our back yard, the night in question we are not sure what we saw but it had orange and blue lights and darted and made turns that no plane could have made at one point it went from (this is and example) say 5,000 feet to 15,000 in about 2 seconds and then it would dart from left to right at what I want to call intense speed. this lasted for appox. 10 to 15 mins. Pleas note: we are not sure of the shape or size due to the fact that in the night sky we are not even sure how far away it was.
