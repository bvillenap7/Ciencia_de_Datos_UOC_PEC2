About 2 miles up I saw what caught my eye as some kind of what I thought were balloons that were drifting away, they seemed to sparkle with colors.  I quickly realized that they were in some sort of very random flight pattern - very much like vultures which are very common in Florida where I live.  But, as kept trying to make out the forms they did not resemble birds or drones, so then my instinct was to think they were people in wing suits, not ultralights.  I followed them again and got caught at another traffic light, but could not film them due to the light changing.  I went to a parking lot and tried to film them again, but by then they were mere tiny black specs and were headed from East to West. When I got home I pulled up the main video and watched it on Edit mode and slowed it down so I could take a closer look at each object and I see that the shapes change and some even have a silver aura and light to them.;25.9573;-80.1375
