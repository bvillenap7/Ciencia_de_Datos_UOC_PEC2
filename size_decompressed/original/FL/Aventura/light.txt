Bright light fly over, as bright as Jupiter, no sound.;2009-11-05 21:00:00;1-2 min;Bright light fly over, as bright as Jupiter, no sound. I was exiting my car at the shopping center parking lot where I work, and I look up at the sky as usual to look at the stars and such. I was facing south when the star like object appeared out of the clouds about south south west, it then flew over me, no sound, I grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look, but it was just a bright single light, no blinking aircraft lights, no shape. As it passed over me, the light stayed the same, didnâ€™t dim, or face away if it would have been a forward facing lap of an aircraft, then I lost it NNW. It went into clouds.;25.9573;-80.1375
12/13/09   Aventura           florida            2 hours                 light   3 objects (12 to start);2009-12-13 14:00:00;10 mins;12/13/09   Aventura    florida       2 hours         light   3 objects (12 to start) i went outside of work to have a cig. and the 2 guys from the store nest to mine were looking up and said look up there we've been watching them since 2 o'clock it was now 4:30. there were 3 objects up into the sky, i mean way up there, no way were they airplanes or anything i now of. they stayed in one spot and then would blink at each other, just the 2 on the outside not the one in the middle. then they would move one at time (not the one in the middle) up down and the other one up down. they were silver and white light, scared me but also mezmerized by this. the 2 guys from next store said when they first say them there were 12 of them they surrounded the middle one for about an hour then took and left the 3 there by themselves. when i was watching at the end they blinked rapidly and just dissappeared. the light was not attached but seemed to come from the whole object, silver to just light;25.9573;-80.1375
