From there I can view the Intracoastal Waterway, the Atlantic Ocean and the rear of a line of homes in a town called Golden Beach.  In order of my view I see the the intracoastal first, then the homes and then the ocean.   From the rear of the homes I saw, rising from ground level a series of 6 large circular lights that were reddish orange in color.  The lights rose in time intervals of a few minutes between each, except for 1 instance in which 2 lights rose simultaneously.   At first the lights rose straight up and then they angled upward at about a 45 degree angle.  They rose extremely high, appearing to me to be the height of the many Jets I see nightly, as I live near the Fort Lauderdale airport, and eventually they became the size of stars and then faded from view.   I contacted the Golden Beach police to inquire if they had any reports of Chinese Lanterns and they said they did not have any reports. ((ADDENDA FROM WITNESS)) 1.  Peter, I did some online research on Chinese Lanterns and after reflection I do not think the rate of speed with which the objects rose was commensurate with a balloon type object. The objects I saw rose rather quickly like a plane gaining altitude, but of course the objects I saw were definitely not planes. Peter In the light of day I can see clearly where the lights originated from .  The intracoastal waterway which is in front of the homes In Golden Beach from my viewpoint.
