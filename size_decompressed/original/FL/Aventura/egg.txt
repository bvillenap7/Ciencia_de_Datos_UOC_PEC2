Three egg-shaped objects drifting over Aventura Mall;1994-07-15 21:00:00;1-2 minutes;Three egg-shaped objects drifting over Aventura Mall The date is approximate, but the time is accurate, as the mall we were at was closing.  My wife and I and my infant daughter and 4 year-old son were leaving the Aventura Mall in Aventura, Florida, and were loading our packages in the car, when I looked up to see three dark, pewter-colored egg-shaped craft in a tight triangular formation pass silently overhead at a fairly slow pace -- it took them a minute to pass from directly overhead to behind the mall structure which was about a football field away.  I wouls estimate that they were less than 1000 feet in the air -- they were definitely below the cloud layer (the sky was partly cloudy).  The objects were silent as they passed over, like I said, pewter colored, but clearly outlined.  There was some surface light reflected off of the objects.  I called my wife, who did see them, but didn't have much to say.  She got into the car with my kids, and I watched them for the duration (about two or so minutes).;25.9573;-80.1375
