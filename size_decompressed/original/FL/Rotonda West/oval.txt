3-dimentional object;2020-01-24 07:06:00;1 second;3-dimentional object 26°53'45.4N 82°16'26.8W The intersection of Parade Circle and Pinehurst in Rotonda West Florida at 7:06 a.m. viewed a beautiful sunrise. Took picture one. Then 30 seconds later took picture 2. I did not see any objects in the sky accept clouds and the color from the sunrise. Later looked at photos and found a 3-dimensional object in the sky just west of the sunrise. It appeared to be yellow and sort of like an acorn shape tilting slightly to the left.  I did not observe it with the naked eye at any time.  Later another photographer showed me a picture taken at 7:03 am just east of my location and her picture has a very strange reflection in it that resembles my object.;26.886;-82.2707
