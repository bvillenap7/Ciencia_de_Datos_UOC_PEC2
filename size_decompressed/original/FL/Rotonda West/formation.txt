Unusual groups of erratic and sometimes retrograde lights.;2011-11-04 19:00:00;2 minutes;Unusual groups of erratic and sometimes retrograde lights. Looking due West, distance approx 1-2 miles, we noticed an unusual group of bright lights moving slowly, general direction South.  Individual lights in the group would suddenly flash brightly and disappear.  Thought originally it might have been a satellite breaking up.  However, as we continued to watch, more lights would flick into existence and other groups would appear elsewhere in the sky, but all due West from our viewpoint.  Another group of four lights appeared ahead of the original group, equidistant from each other in a straight line covering about 100 yards.  These too blinked out but reappeared BEHIND the original group.  General color of lights yellowish but as those that blinked out were extremely bright white.;26.886;-82.2707
