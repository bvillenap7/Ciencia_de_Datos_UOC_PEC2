3 lights appear in the sky, rotating and seperate.;1982-06-01 21:00:00;15 sec;3 lights appear in the sky, rotating and seperate. This is a sighting I had many years ago with a friend.  We were hanging out on the roof of my parents house, just talking a looking at stars. It was a clear night and we would see an occasional plane pass by. Then from the SE we saw a dim white light moving NW with another light rotating around it, on a horizontal plane.  The altitude appeared to be very high (I can’t estimate an altitude, it was just a light about the brightness of a star) moving very fast.  No sound.  Once it crossed the sky (approx 10-15 seconds), suddenly the rotating light separated and a third light crossed their path on a northern trajectory.  The light which broke off, I can’t remember it’s final trajectory. I have since become a private pilot and have studied various aircraft at different altitudes.  I can say that it was definitely not an aircraft or any type of meteor.;28.6180001424502;-80.8425521367526
12/17/11 Orange/green fireball streaking from south to north, East coast of Florida, 1810 hrs E.S.T.;2011-12-17 18:10:00;6 to 10 seconds;12/17/11 Orange/green fireball streaking from south to north, East coast of Florida, 1810 hrs E.S.T. At approx 1810 hrs, I was delivering a car to my neighbor.  I live on the East Coast of Central Florida, approx 9 miles west of Kennedy Space Center and the Atlantic Ocean.  In the corner of my eye, I noticed a bright orange streak out over the ocean (East of my location).  I then turned and directly watched this light continue from a south to north direction until it was out of my sight.  It began as an orange fireball, and rapidly changed color to a bright blue-green as it left my line of sight.  It was moving way too slowly to be a meteor, yet seemed rather fast to be an aircraft as I know one.  I'm assuming that it may have been an object falling from orbit.  I have spent quite some time in the desert and on the ocean, and this was extremely out of the ordinary, and was way too bright to be anything ordinary.;28.6180001424502;-80.8425521367526

Saw what appeared to be a star near the moon, however it was moving slowly to the west.;2015-07-23 20:03:00;8 minutes;Saw what appeared to be a star near the moon, however it was moving slowly to the west. While watching a Delta IV launch from Cape Canaveral last week, during excellent weather, I saw what I thought was a star just to the west of the moon.  I thought it was a star because it looked like the often observed conjunction between Jupiter or Venus and the moon.  But then, I noticed the object was moving slowly westward.   My wife, daughter (15) and son (8) were there and I commented to them about the object, but they did not seem very interested.   As I watched, I thought how much it looked like a star and wished I had seen it pass from the east side (my wife had commented that she earlier had seen it on the east side of the moon) to the west side of the moon, because it would have had to pass in front of or behind it.    I observed the object and took several (approximately 18) photos.  I was fascinated by the object, because I could not imagine what it was.  After about 10 minutes, when I wasn't watching it as closely, I noticed it was gone.  Looking at the photos afterward under magnification, there appears to be a much smaller light moving around the larger object.;28.6180001424502;-80.8425521367526
Saw 2 orange orbs rise from wooded land west of Titusville, head east and then follow I-95 north for several minutes.;2015-12-31 22:00:00;5 minutes;saw 2 orange orbs rise from wooded land west of Titusville, head east and then follow I-95 north for several minutes on my roof on new yrs eve, saw 2 orange lights suddenly rise vertically from fox lake park area (slightly south or southwest of park-apparently)..thought they were fireworks at first, but they continued to rise and then became brighter as they were apparently headed east towards me..lights were pulsating regularly (not blinking off and on) they were moving too slowly for jets or prop planes and slowly turned north and paralleled I-95..as they progressed north the upper one descended and eventually disappeared in thin clouds..the lower one slowly ascended and turned slightly west of north and was visible for a couple more minutes staying on same heading until it slowly faded in distance..even at closest distance before turning north there was no sound..they didn't appear to be more than a mile or so away at that point- they were then much larger and brighter than any star-there were no Navigation lights (green or white);28.6180001424502;-80.8425521367526

Within about 5 minutes they changed formation 3 times before disappearing. Driving on 95 South at night, the driver noticed a group of orange lights in the formation of the Big Dipper.  There were about 10-12 lights and they were bigger than stars, but not huge.  The driver pointed out the lights to the 2 passengers.  The lights then changed formation to a crooked vertical line with 3 of them making a triangle close to the top of the line.  After a minute or so they changed formation again into a straight vertical line.  After another minute or so they completely disappeared.;28.6180001424502;-80.8425521367526

Objects look like stars but moving fast in one line.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-30 21:05:00;12 minutes;Objects look like stars but moving fast in one line My wife and me saw fast moving light in dark ( 9 PM ) Light moving with same distance between each other , approximately we saw 157 , in one line without sound from North West to South .  Only last one was slightly out of line and more closely with previous  .;28.6180001424502;-80.8425521367526
