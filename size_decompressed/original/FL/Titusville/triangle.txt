I have goose bumps on my arms just thinking about it..I wish I would have never seen this flying object because I will think about it the rest of my life..This thing seemed to be maybe 180 to 200 feet above me.

4 triangular sightings with different light patterns in quick succession.  ((anonymous report));2019-04-16 21:30:00;30 minutes;4 triangular sightings with different light patterns in quick succession Driving north on I-95 first UFO appeared to be a plane that wasn’t moving until it was closer in view.  Triangular, lights of multiple colors flashing.   A second appeared within 5 minutes.  Someone else noticed this one and had pulled over to watch it.  Similar to the first but different pattern of flashing lights.   About ten minutes later, two in close proximity to one another appeared, and then one stayed put and the other zoomed across the sky.  The one that stayed still didn’t have multi- colored lights — only white.  The other had lights that changed color.  Eventually the one that zoomed away zig zagged back nearer our car and kept changing elevation and light flashing patterns.  It zoomed off again and that was it.   The whole thing lasted about half an hour between Titusville and New Smyrna Beach exits on 95. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
