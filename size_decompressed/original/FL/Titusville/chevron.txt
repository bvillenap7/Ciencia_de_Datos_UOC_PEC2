UFO Red Lights Sighting in Titusville;2010-07-15 21:00:00;2 minutes;UFO Red Lights Sighting in Titusville While sitting due east of Kennedy Space Center, I notices a bright Red light in the North at the horizon over the tree line.  It was a solid red light unlike the flashing airline lights.  I did not notice any white lights at all.  I watched the lights get closer and I called my wife to look at this strange aircraft.  My sister in law joined me and we both watched as it got closer.   I went in to get a pair of binoculars and looked at it through them.  It looked like six red spot lights in a v shape.  I went back inside to get my camera and called my wife to look at this.   She came out and was watching it as it got more overhead.  Before I was able to get my camera turned it moved rapidly to the west and then stopped and vanished.   The sky was cloudless and it was just after sundown.   The vehicle made no audible sounds  Other aircraft at that same position can be heard.  I saw numerous other planes in the sky but not this vehicle.;28.6180001424502;-80.8425521367526
