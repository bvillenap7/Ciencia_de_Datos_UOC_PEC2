I saw a moon-sized white glowing circular light divide into two smaller lights as it travelled like a shooting star across the sky.;2007-07-19 13:30:00;approx. 5 seconds;I saw a moon-sized white glowing circular light divide into two smaller lights as it travelled like a shooting star across the sky. On Thursday, July 19 at approximately 1:30 a.m. I saw a round white light in the distant sky.  It was a little smaller in size than a full moon.  About half way through the siting, it split into two circles, each about half the size of the original circle.  I saw it/them for approximately five seconds total before I lost sight of them behind a tree.  The trajectory had a slight downward arc as it travelled horizontally across the sky.  I saw it/them travel approximately 15 degrees across the sky horizontally.  It/they were approximately 40 degrees above the horizon vertically.  The light intensity was a little less than a full moon, with a softer glow than the moon has on a clear night. I got the impression that the large light was spinning counter-clockwise as it divided in two, like the second circle spun off from the original.  Both smaller circles were the same size.  It/they did not change speed or trajectory during the time I was observing.  After it divided, both smaller circles stayed next to each other horizontally and continued on the same trajectory as the original. In my opinion, it did not behave like a spacecraft.  Except for the splitting, it behaved like a giant shooting star.  The dividing process appeared consistent with how a rotating ball of liquid or gas might divide in two. There was lightening activity in the sky earlier in the evening. I observed this in Titusville, Florida (northwest of the Kennedy Space Center on the east coast of central Florida).  I was looking to the west when I saw this phenonemon.;28.6180001424502;-80.8425521367526
Observed brilliant white circular light emitting a bright blue lazer like beam from each side.;2013-12-02 18:00:00;5 minutes;Observed brilliant white circular light emitting a bright blue lazer like beam from each side. I live in north Brevard County Florida, in the city of Titusville, approximately one mile to the north of a small regional airport, Titusville Executive Airport. Also, Orlando Interational Airport is approximately 40 miles to my west/southwest.  Patrick Airforce Base is approximately 30 miles to my east/southeast, and the Kennedy Space Center approximately 12 miles due east.  As a result, I frequently see, and am familiar with all manner of small, private, single/multi-engine propeller and jet aircraft, as well as commercial and military aircraft.  Furthermore, I am familiar with their lighting and flight characteristics. On the evening of December 2nd, 2013 at approximately 6:30 pm, I observed an unusual display of lights in the western sky as I was driving south on the street I live on, approaching my home.   My attention was initially drawn to the object due to its unusual brilliance, purity of color(s), and size.  The object was located west/southwest of my position, about 45° above the horizon and appeared to be moving slowly towards me.   My initial thought was that it was simply a commercial flight from O.I.A. and that its unusual features were caused by flairing due to viewing it through the window glass.  However, I quickly dismissed this notion once I had exited my car and seen it with the naked eye, unobstructed by any glass.   The object appeared to be circular, about the size of a large pea held at arm's length.  It was an absolutely pure white, diamond-like brilliance I have never seen and, projecting downward from each side, at about a 45° angle, there was an i! ntense lazer-like blue beam.  These beams appeared about the diameter of the shaft of a round wooden toothpick, and the length appeared approximatelty equal to the diameter of the light.  I watched it for several minutes as it maintained it's approach at a very low speed. I would have stood there all night watching it and tried to get a picture on my cell phone, but my father-in-law was seriously, in the hospital, and we were rushing to try to get to the hospital to see him.   I simply cannot get that image out of my mind, it was unlike anything I have ever seen. I hope this account helps in some small way the effort to finally get an answer as to what these things are that so many people around the world have been reporting for so many years.;28.6180001424502;-80.8425521367526
White sphere, no tail.;2015-07-25 05:00:00;5-6 seconds;White sphere, no tail. I saw it through a tree and I thought it was a helicopter with its spotlight on.   After it passed through the tree we could see it was a white circle without a tail.;28.6180001424502;-80.8425521367526
