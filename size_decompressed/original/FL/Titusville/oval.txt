White oval shape in sky during the day;2020-08-20 13:15:00;3.5 minutes;White oval shape in sky during the day Was standing outside watering plants and happened to look up. I saw a white oval shaped object hovering.  I thought I was seeing things so I went inside and grabbed my binoculars. I focused and I wasn’t seeing things, it was white/light grayish in color it was hovering and then began to move forward, then shot off VERY VERY FAST!! I then lost sight!  My fiancé was with me and saw it as well.  We’re still in shock from what we both saw. After the “tick tack” videos, I’m 100% that’s exactly the same object we BOTH saw!;28.6180001424502;-80.8425521367526
