Flat, grey objects soar through nite sky near Kennedy Space Center in Florida;2000-07-09 20:30:00;3 SECONDS;Flat, grey objects soar through nite sky near Kennedy Space Center in Florida Observing the night sky looking up & facing north 2 flat, square objects soared overhead from behind me from the south, in a northerly direction. They appeared a dark gray, possibly reflecting light from the ground. No lights were visable and no sound noted. Thier formation was close, almost touching point to point. Size, speed and altitude unknown, objects blocked star field during sighting. I ran inside and explained what I saw to my wife, but the look on her face and her words don't tell anyone else or they will think your a nut ended it there. I can't explain what I saw, but it feels good to tell someone anyway. ((NUFORC Note:  Source is semi-anonymous.  PD));28.1821999999998;-80.6117000000006
Rocket Shaped Craft with 2 USAF jets in pursuit at 4:30 am coming from the over the ocean;2001-11-01 04:30:00;10 seconds;Rocket Shaped Craft with 2 USAF jets in pursuit at 4:30 am coming from the over the ocean Myself and another person saw a rocket shaped ufo. It was around halloween, and a full moon, so clearly visible. I checked the moon phases of 2001 and there was a full moon on 11/01/01. So it was 10/31, 11/01 or 11/02.   I live down the street from Patrick Air Force Base and Cape Canaveral, so I know air and space craft/rockets. It was past the hours of passenger air traffic time. And there were no launches from the Cape or base. It came from the ocean (East,S.East) at (4:30 am)and traveled (West,N.West). Patrick AFB is 4 blocks to the North and Canaveral is 20 miles North.  It was approximately 4:30 am. I work late and was winding down. I was outside, behind my house,in Satellite beach,Fl. staring at the FULL moon, looking South. (2 blocks from the ocean) . IT WAS LIKE DAY TIME! All of a sudden a rocket shaped object was flying across the sky. I called to my friend to look, and she saw it too. It Had a cone nose like a pencil. Like an early US rocket that launched to the moon. It was larger than any commercial jet. It was silver/blue looking like brushed metal from the reflection of the sun off the moon. It had no markings. It had no lights at all. It was silent. It had a singular con-trail following the craft. It had no wings. If you put the rocket shaped craft in front of the moon It's length woud be about 2/3 the circumference. We watched it for approximately 10 seconds.  It was like DAYTIME! Clearly visible! It came from the, (East-S.east) and traveled, (West-N.West) 2 fighter jets followed shortly after but could not come close to catching, or keeping up with it. We could see the 2 fighter jets glow of the engines. The rocket shaped object had no glow of any engine and was 6-10 times as big as the fighters. All were extremly high in the atmosphere. You could clearly see this craft, but it had no sound. The jets were just specks, but you could hear them. EXAMPLE OF SIZE......  UFO ( ---- )     USAF JETS  ( . )  It was close after Sept 11. My first thought was  a Nuclear Missle. and my heart went to my throat. I stood there waiting for a glow in the distance. None ever came. We just saw the jets flying around in the sky N.west in the distance for a while.  Never called anyone if PAFB Picked anything up on radar. Jets were in the air and in pursuit, so I figured there was no one to call. I am still curious but do not know who would give me any information on the said evening.  P.S.- This is a reprint because I wanted to mention that we could hear the jets engine but not the larger UFO.;28.1821999999998;-80.6117000000006
