Big bright white sphere over the sky that looks bigger than a full moon, without making a sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flares.  PD));2016-07-16 20:00:00;5 minutes;Big bright white sphere over the sky that looks bigger than a full moon, without making a sound. On July 16, 2016, I went to Satellite Beach with my family at the board walk we stop to take some family pictures, my camera caught a big round white sphere next to the sun, for an instance I thought it was the moon, but I turned my head and was able to see the moon clearly on the other side, then I took another picture of this strange body that looked like another planet, but bigger than the moon, I do have pictures of this sighting.
