Illuminous rose colored craft sited in Satellite Beach.;2005-06-01 00:00:00;seconds;Illuminous rose colored craft sited in Satellite Beach. I was walking my dogs late night(sometime around midnight early morning 12:10 June1) and was on my way back home, about 3 houses away. I looked up and above the tree tops I saw a close up of a very large craft,rose in color, no sound. It was so close, I saw at least 2 black wide doorways/motifs with a narrow horizontial window located in each. I believe it was either circular or oblong. I could not see the top or bottom and it had no obvious lights, but it was luminated. The strange feeling I got was whomever was inside wanted to make sure I saw it, reason for it being so close. I didn't see it arrive and it was gone in a flash. I still wonder why I looked up at that moment. Two nights latter I had a dream or maybe it was an experience, I'm not sure. Someone who appeared to be human was holding a gun like object aimed at my torso, which slightly burned and I could not move. It was clear & blue about 16 long. Latter in this happening I saw the gun again and I remember saying Don't use that again. I was in a standing position. I was scared from the moment I saw the UFO and having the experience/dream didn't help. I still wonder if it's going to reappear, but my fear isn't as intense. I would of reported this earlier,  today I just found the website.;28.1821999999998;-80.6117000000006
