I never put in the report what happened just before I saw the UFO.   I was walking my dogs around midnight & was almost back home.  I had just passed my neighbor's house who had the United States flag placed on the house.  I recall seeing the flag moving in the breeze & then everything began to quiver around me.   The next thing I remember was looking up at the UFO.  I believe I was taken right when the quivering took place & returned when I looked up & saw the UFO.  I think they wanted me to see them.  It's been 8 years since this happening.  Some time after this event I also had a different experience, which involved a close encounter with a being.  I had lost track of time & the dogs wanted out.  I got as far as the end of my driveway & saw a small being in a white space suite & helmet across the street.  It was on the side of my neighbor's house.  I froze, dogs didn't bark.  I immediately turned around! & went back to my house & got a flashlight.  I looked at the time & it was about 1:40 am.  When I returned to the end of the driveway the being was gone.  The being was about the size of a 8-10 year old child.  The white suite had bulbous arms an also bulbous legs on the upper part.  I saw no face,  I guess it had it's back toward me.  I no longer walk my dogs after dark.  These happenings have haunted me ever since.  There are times I wish there was a support group for people like me who have had UFO related experiences.  I was so scared I never reported the last incident until now.  I was afraid the military was going to come & take me away.

UFO sighted in Satellite Beach,FL close encounter 4 blocks from beach;2005-06-01 00:00:00;seconds;UFO sighted in Satellite Beach,FL close encounter 4 blocks from beach I was walking my dogs around midnight and was on my way back home. For some reason I looked up into the sky and and image flashed before my eyes.  It happened so fast! It was a rosey color with 2 black doorways or could of been motiffs. Inside appeared to be a long horizontial window within each doorway. I could only see this side, I didn't see top or bottom.  There was no sound and I didn't see it arrive or depart. The part that bothers me is it was so close, just above the tree tops. This sighting was about 2=3 houses from where I live. I was facing north west.  I live about 4 blocks from the ocean.  The dogs didn't seem to notice anything, no barking.  This took place on or after midnight. I tried to put in 06/01/2005, but it would not accept in the form. I only have a webtv unit, maybe that's the reason.  I also reported this before, but I didn't see it listed. I also had a strange dream or experience 2 nights later.  I was standing and what appeared to be a human aimed a gun like object at my torso and I remember my stomach burning.  I could not move.  Later on I remember telling him not to do that again. The gun was about 16 long clear and blue. The entire experience really did scare me and I can't seem to put it aside.  I had sent a sketch of this sighting last week via email.;28.1821999999998;-80.6117000000006
