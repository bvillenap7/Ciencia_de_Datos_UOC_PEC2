3 barely visible Dark brown lights in triangle formation heading NE across Sat Bch Florida.;2011-12-21 22:55:00;about 5 seconds;3 barely visible Dark brown lights in triangle formation heading NE across Sat Bch Florida. Last night on December 22, 2011 at 10:55pm I was lying on my driveway admiring the stars when I saw three large dark brown orbs zip across the sky. If I hadn’t been looking in just the right spot I would have missed it. It flew across the entire horizon in about 5 seconds heading NE (30 degrees). I couldn’t determine wither or not it was three separate lights or a whole craft, I want to say that it was not a formation because I didn’t observe any stars within the possible area of the craft. The color of the orbs was more of a dark brown than a dark red. Determining the size of the craft was more difficult, from my perspective the craft was 1 1/2“ to 2” in size.  Regardless of the craft’s size and altitude it traveled at incredible speeds with no sound.  Human aircraft was in the area but I didn’t see any.;28.1821999999998;-80.6117000000006
