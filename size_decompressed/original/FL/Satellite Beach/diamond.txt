Bright hovering object due east of Satellite Beach visible to naked eye - what is it?;2008-01-10 02:00:00;continuous;Bright hovering object due east of Satellite Beach visible to naked eye - what is it? This is my second reporting within a couple of weeks.  This sighting seems more convincing than last posting in that the sparkling object has multiple lights, including a blinking series of lights at bottom and left hand side, almost like flashlight strength from helicopter.  The object's location in sky is right at sea/sky's horizon due east of Satellite Beach, lower and nearer than past reporting.  The movement of the object is small darts or pendulum like swings to left, right and up.  The object is not on the same movement/trajectory up into the sky as was last reported of possible Venus/Mars location.  This object has not ascended but has rather remained in a hovering position at same eye level as a cruise ship that would be on the horizon leaving Port Canaveral.  This is clearly not a cruiseliner, but appears to be circular or some sort of patroling device due to the light projectory twinkling like a star and like it is looking intently for something over the ocean.  It is nearer to the surface and to the shoreline than last reporting.  The movement is more pronounced as hovering or observing than ascending into the sky with Earth's rotation...it is now 31 minutes into my observation and the object is clearly some sort of craft due to the smaller light on bottom left, and movement resembling that of a darting insect, not a star or planet.  Hope this helps, it's bizarre, and I'm returning to sleep.  If I wake up again I will submit another update of what I am seeing.;28.1821999999998;-80.6117000000006
