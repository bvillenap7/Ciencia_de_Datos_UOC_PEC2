Several minutes later two planes approached (we could hear the jet engines) and circled the large orange light once before the light vanished.  The planes moved away but continued the circle the island for the next half hour.  A similar orange light appeared further down the beach (could not be sure it was the same as before since it was farther away) and blinked again for a couple minutes then disappeared.  The sky was slightly cloudy but with visible stars and we were out on the beach for several hours. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
