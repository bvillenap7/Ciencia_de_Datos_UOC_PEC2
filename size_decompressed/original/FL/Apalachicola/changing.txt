The other 3 family members were a 90 year old mother who suffers from dementia, an  infant, and a person who prefers not to ever talk about it. The weather was warm and unseasonable, even for Florida, and the sky was as blue as i had ever seen it plus there were no clouds or birds to be seem.   I was commenting about the weather and blue sky when i saw it.  It (UFO) was soundless, wingless, and the last thing to come to my mind was space craft but i knew it was not of this world.   It came closer, then changed into different forms, then the seagulls came. then it transformed itself to match the illuminated glow of the seagulls which seemed to adorn it. .[p/ ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the report is a hoax.

This sighting occured on july 4th as i was taking my early morning walk. i had already walked a short distance when all of a sudden, up in the sky directly in front of me was a bright star.  But i noticed that the star seemed too bright and close to earth for that time of the morning which was at approx. 6:30am. still walking and looking up,this star seemed to be moving. i stopped walking to observe it, it looked put or still.  i started walking again, again it seemed to be moving slowly. i stopped walking again and i could see that indeed it really was moving. Then like they alway do, it changed. It went from a simulated star to a bright light that was yellow and red in color, like the color of fire. I stood there watching it as it seemed to just scurry away. I dont know how many feet in the air it was. all i know that it was at a far enough distance for me to feel comfortable watching it.;29.7185;-84.9887
