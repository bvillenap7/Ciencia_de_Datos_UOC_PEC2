Faded white oval light Breaking through the clouds;2011-10-20 09:30:00;1 min;Faded white oval light Breaking through the clouds We were outside, then something fast was moving through the clouds.  At first we thought it was a flock of birds, but REALLY that high.   Then it lit up and went kind of invisible, we still saw it moving south because the front part had a faded white light shaping whatever that was into an oval shape.;26.0476;-80.1447
