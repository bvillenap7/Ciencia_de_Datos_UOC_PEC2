White cube shaped object:one corner turned to the left (north west);2001-05-06 14:00:00;20 minutes;White cube shaped object:one corner turned to the left (north west) 5-6-01 While watching the air show from Dania Beach Pier(air show was due north of the pier) I observed what looked like a bright white star on the horizon , due east of the pier.I  watched it through 8 x 50 binoculors ,one eye only due to the far distance.I saw a white cube shape object. It stayed in the same exact same place for about twenty minutes and then disappered below the horizon or into the ocean(could not tell due to the distance) when some boats started to pass close by. It did not look like any conventional or military aircraft I have ever seen,and I ruled out a sailfishing kite because it stayed in the same place for at least a twenty minute period , and it was not the same shape of a kite. Does anyone one know of any other sightings like this?    ((name and e-address deleted));26.0476;-80.1447
