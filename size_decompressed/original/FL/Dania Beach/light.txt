US military tried to shoot down UFO off the coast of South Florida.;2001-05-18 03:30:00;about 2 minutes;US military tried to shoot down UFO off the coast of South Florida. It was a partly cloudy early morning it was still dark. I had been fishing with my father on the Dania Beach pier since midnight. It was also a moonlit sky, with the Moon positioned over the Eastern sky which lit up the water and clouds below,  As I looked out over the surf I witnessed a red light coming from my left field of vision moving left to right over the water, a few miles out. Behind this light, my father and I witnessed two contrails that were lit up by the moonlight, which seemed to chase this bright red light, which did not pulsate or change color.  The light suddenly stopped for a second and lowered its elevation, made a quick maneuver to the right and continued south along the coast. The contrails could not keep pace with the light, which then again stopped, this time the orb seemed to expand and become brighter. It then bursted into many fine particles like an industrial firework, then this same process went into reverse and it seemed to implode and collapse on itself and then disappeared over the water. No sound was heard or did we see debris of any kind fall from the orb. My jaw just dropped and we could not believe what we had just witnessed. The contrails finally fizzed.  In a matter of a minute we then witnessed two military jets fly into this area over the water. They were military because they had one red pulsing light on the fuselage and I grew up on an air force base and I am familiar with how fast they move.  These jets were probably scrambled from Homestead AFB. We then thought, could the military be conducting missile tests over open waters right off the coast? We tried to come up with a rational explanation. Until this day I feel that the military was trying to shoot this object (UFO) down.;26.0476;-80.1447
