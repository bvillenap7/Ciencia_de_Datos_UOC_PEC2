Swirling star, glowing cloud, and flashing objects.;2013-08-07 20:40:00;4-5 minutes;Swirling star, glowing cloud, and flashing objects. I was going to the gnc in Oakwood plaza Hollywood, fl when me and my boyfriend had noticed a strange star in the sky that seemed to swirl with a trail of what seemed like white cloud.  After looking up for some 30 seconds we also noticed flashing star like objects forming around the swirling star.   A couple seconds later the swirling star started to disappear..  Not only that we also noticed a cloud itself lighting up. I took some photos that I will attach to this report.   This is not a joke so please don't disregard this report.   I am not an alien fanatic or anything I'm a regular citizen trying to make a point.. Thanks;26.0476;-80.1447
