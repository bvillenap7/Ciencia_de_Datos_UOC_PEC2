Longboat key, Fl I counted at least 18 orange colored resembling the north star, flying in total precision one at a time in a straight line low enough to hear engine if there had been any.  One would fly over, and as soon as it did, I could see another one coming in the distance.  This was repeated at least 18 times. at 5-10 second intervals perfectly timed.   When I contacted policeman, he told me he had seen the exact same thing three weeks ago in approximately the same place, and pulled over to see it.;27.4109;-82.6613
