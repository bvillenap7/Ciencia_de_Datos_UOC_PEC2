Orange balls of light, blinking, drifiting in formations.  ((anonymous report));2015-12-19 22:00:00;15 minutes;Orange balls of light, blinking, drifiting in formations. I was driving (at 10pm, Saturday, December 19th, on Solana Road (west) in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fl.  I looked up at the moon, and to the right I noticed a large group of orange lights.  I noticed that a group of maybe 5 lights were in a perfect, straight line.   Another group were grouped together like a triangle, and about 10 others were just spread out randomly.  Sometimes they were blinking, and sometimes disappearing.   After disappearing, they would reappear.  There were no other lights on them anywhere.   Some moved quickly around the others that were just drifting.  I pulled over and watched for a few moments, trying to get a video.  Nothing would show up on my phone so I drove home.  I told my boyfriend, and we drove back down the road and he was able to see about 3 of them coming up over a golf course.  Then they just disappeared.  Very strange.

Orange ball of light not moving for more than 20 minutes.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a sighting of a planet?  Mars?  PD));2018-07-03 01:00:00;>20 minutes;Orange ball of light not moving for more than 20 minutes I looked in the sky and saw an orange ball of light with no movement.  I called my brother out to see it as well.  I took pictures and it looks like a rocky shape surrounds the ball of light.  It looked to be above the edge of the coast.  We watched for about 20 minutes and it did not move.   My brother wanted to go to bed and I was afraid to stay out there by myself, so I could not see what it did from there.    Last night, July 4th, it was there again in the same spot and not moving. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a sighting of a planet?  Mars?  PD));30.1342479166667;-81.3653770833333
