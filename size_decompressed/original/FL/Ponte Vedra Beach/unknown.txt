Streaking Light Over Jacksonville Beach, Florida;2002-07-30 21:39:00;2 seconds;Streaking Light Over Jacksonville Beach, Florida On Tuesday, July 30, 2002, I was stopped at a traffic light facing north on A1A next to the turn off to J. T. Butler Boulevard when I saw a bright light flash through the night sky beyond the traffic light. An object appeared to enter the atmosphere at an angle of about 60 to 70 degrees off perpendicular from the east falling down and to the west. The object made 3 or 4 bright streaks in a straight line similar to a dashed line. I counted 1,2,3 then the streaks of light stopped then looked at the time on the car radio. It read 9:39 PM. If I held my hand at arms length each streak was as long as the width of a fingernail and as thick (At least 4 to five times thicker than any meteor I saw during the Leonid meteor showers) as a 9mm lead for a mechanical pencil. The length of the streak and the length of the blackness between the streaks appeared to be approximately equal. The light was very bright with a round shape leading each streak. What is prompting me to report this was the color. There seemed to be a glow of a blue or blue-green color the surrounded the leading ball shape. I am a 54-year-old manager in a major corporation and studied business, engineering and art. (BA, MBA).;30.1342479166667;-81.3653770833333
