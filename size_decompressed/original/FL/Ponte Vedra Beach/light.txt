LIghts in the sky that disappear and re-appear , with missing time..;2001-06-19 21:00:00;approx 4 hous;LIghts in the sky that disappear and re-appear , with missing time.. We arrived at the beach around 9 pm , as we sat talking on the beach - we noticed a light that was at a pretty low altitude, about a 1/2 mile out over the water. It would fade the reappear, move from side to side quickly. Then another one popped up out of no where, doing the same thing - fading in and out - moving swiftly left and right - One appeared to be getting closer, I freaked out - took of running of the beach crying - why I dont know - I just all of the sudden felt over whelmingly scared. The weird thing was that we spent MAYBE 45 minutes on the beach - But when we got back to the car - it was a quarter to 1 AM! FREAKED US OUT!

Orange lights traveling in sequence/formation as never seen before.;2012-01-01 01:00:00;5 minutes;Orange lights traveling in sequence/formation as never seen before. Saw 15 orange lights in sequence (formation) traveling low on the horizon, west to east.  Traveling too fast to be helicopters.  All objects increased in altitude and speed as they turned to the north and out of sight.  First thought was aircraft launched from NAS Jacksonville, FL.  Any explanations?;30.1342479166667;-81.3653770833333
Three sets of bright lights, aligned, moving from horizontal to slightly tilted, turning on and off, then completely vanishing.;2019-12-20 10:30:00;5 minutes;Three sets of bright lights, aligned, moving from horizontal to slightly tilted, turning on and off, then completely vanishing. Three sets of three lights in a row, turning on then completely dissapearing.  One set of three came as close to the beach as to where waves start breaking and lit up, one light at a time and then lights out and nothing.  Just completely vaporized.  There was nothing to see not like a car shining its brights, then turning them off.  The lights did not cause my pupils to make light impressions after they turned off, into the dark sky.

Fleet of 30 crafts traveling in a row.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-29 21:15:00;5 minutes;Fleet of 30 crafts traveling in a row At approximately 9:15 pm my husband and I were standing near the river and looked up to see a fleet of about 30 crafts (small lights) moving out of a cloaked area of the sky (north) and moving in a perfect line, perfectly spaced apart to the south.  They moved into a space in the sky where one by one each would disappear.  No sound at all.  The whole event took about 5 minutes.  We witnessed about 2-3 more after the initial fleet also come out of the cloaked area to the north and also move south into  another “cloaked” area where they disappeared . It was like nothing we have ever seen.;30.1342479166667;-81.3653770833333
