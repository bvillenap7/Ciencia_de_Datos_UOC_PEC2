Odd shape ,a square with the front missing lots of lights red, blue, white on each side cabin like in rear.;2006-08-22 21:30:00;3 minutes;Odd shape ,a square with the front missing lots of lights red, blue, white on each side cabin like in rear. Object large and shaped like a catamaran. Red, white and blue lights flashing and twirling on underside of sides.  In the rear of the square shape were lights like in an airplane cabin but going side to side just in one area. Could see no lights in the front of the object.  Sounded like a commercial aircraft and I looked up to see when I heard the engine or engins cut off. I thought a problem.  Engines started again and it headed south.  As it headed south I heard the engine or engines cut off again. The lights were very bright and active.It would look like it was propelled from the rear.;30.1342479166667;-81.3653770833333
