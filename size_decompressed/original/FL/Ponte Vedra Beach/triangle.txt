Green fast moving light in the morning sky.;2019-04-04 06:50:00;5 seconds;Green fast moving light in the morning sky On my way to work 4/4/2019 at 6:50 am, I was stopped at the red light on Palm Valley Road (CR 210) in Ponte Vedra turning left onto A1A when off to the left at about 10,000-20,000 feet in the air, I noticed a small narrow object that looked like the tip of an arrow head, but without wings and it had  green propulsion coming out of the back.  It was making its way east (from land, out to the Atlantic Ocean) going extremely fast, somewhere around 2,000 to 3,000 mph.  There was also no exhaust or vapor trail.;30.1342479166667;-81.3653770833333
