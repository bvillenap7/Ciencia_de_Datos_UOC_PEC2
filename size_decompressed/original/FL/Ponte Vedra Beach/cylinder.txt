8 green/white objects flying over ponte vedra beach, fl.;2012-12-25 18:10:00;30 seconds;8 green/white objects flying over ponte vedra beach, fl I was driving on A1A north and saw 8 objects with green and white flashing light.  I thought they were helicopters, but as I got a closer look and they moved over my car, they just looked like stars, but flying the same height a helicopter would.  They were in the formation of a V, all separated by a few hundred feet (estimate).  There was one that seemed to be further away from the others.  It was dark so all I could see was the colors opposed to the actual shape or dimensions.   I opened my window to see if I could hear the sound of helicopters, but heard nothing.  Other cars around me also seemed to slow down and look.  Whatever it was came off the ocean and Jacksonville has a big military base so it very well could have been helicopters but I have seen them throughout the years and to me these didn't look like them.  As I drove away they disappeared..;30.1342479166667;-81.3653770833333
