Triangular shape object with five white light in a triangular formation beneath object structure.;2008-07-16 20:45:00;3 minutes;Triangular shape object with five white light in a triangular formation beneath object structure. Something odd was flying around in the Gulf Breeze area. On June 26, 2008, I noticed a somewhat bright, solid, reddish light stationary in the sky that was probably 500 yards off the ground. It stayed in that position for at least five minutes never moving or doing anything else. Earlier that evening, there was some helicopters flying around, and they never stopped and hover in one position. I suspected the solid red light might be a helicopter, but I never heard any noise coming from it. I estimate the distance the object was from me about half a mile and located North-East in direction. I had a camera in my car and I went to get it. That took about five minutes. When I tried to locate the object in the sky, I could find it. The event took place around 9:00 PM. The next day, my friend and I went fishing again at Bob’s site bridge. I didn’t think to bring the camera with me. Again, I saw the red light around 9:00PM situated in the same area in the sky at the same height and direction. I hurried to my car again which took at least five minutes. Again I couldn’t locate the object which appeared to be stationary in the sky for at least two minutes before I left to get the camera. On July 16, 2008, my friend and I went fishing at Bob’s sites. This time I had my camera with me. We fished on the pier instead of the bridge.  There was lots of people fishing which is unusual for a Wednesday.  The sky was clear and the almost full moon was rising . I was facing North and it was about 8:45PM when I noticed an object coming from the North. I watched the object as it made a turn to the North-East.  It wasn’t a passenger jet.  As the object made the turn like a jet, I clearly saw for a brief moment the shape of the object. It was triangular in shape like a B-2 stealth bomber. I also saw five separate white lights in a triangular formation beneath the wing-like structure which also appeared to be part of the craft structure.  After that moment, I got my camera out. The object was now heading North-East. I could only see two separate light orange/red in color and fading slowly.  I put the camera in available light mode and zoomed in at max, but I couldn’t see the object in the viewer.  I took two pictures anyways hoping that maybe I get something. After downloading the pictures onto my computer, I was not able to see the object or lights.  It might had been a military jet, but that is the fist time I saw a triangular shape object flying around in the area of Gulf Breeze, and I lived near this area practically my whole life.  There was no strobe lights, red lights, or green lights on the object.  Nothing to indicate that it was a commercial jet.;30.3879326530612;-87.0622775510205

There was a loud screech that came from it.  I dont know how close it was but the noise real loud.  My friend was with me.;30.3879326530612;-87.0622775510205
