strange bright cloud  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Cape Canaveral.  PD));2004-08-31 19:51:00;45 minutes;strange bright cloud While grilling some fish outside I noticed a bar of white light in the southeastern ski near the star Arcturus. It was a five degree blob of light that looked like a cloud. Using binoculars, I resolved the blur into what looked like an angel-shaped blob of light... complete with wings. Sounds incredible, but that's what it looked like. This was a cloud of light...not a craft and after an hour it dissipated. It looked similar to a cloud formation when a rocket blasts off ... I saw a similar cloud two years ago in Arizona when a rocket shot off from California. What the hell was this strange cloud? I know it sounds weird saying it looked angel-shaped... but oddly enough, it looked like that...at least in binoculars. I am a college professor, amateur astronomer and not a religious fanatic.. Peter if you get similar reports, please contact me at ((e-address deleted)) I am near Eglin AFB and Pensacola Naval Base and of course near ground zero for the famous Gulf Breeze sightings of the '80s. cheers, ((initials deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.
