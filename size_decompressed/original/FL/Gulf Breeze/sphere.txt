Three super bright craft emitting triangular light array.;1996-12-10 19:50:00;15 minutes;Three super bright craft emitting triangular light array. I was driving with two friends across Bob Sikes (3-Mile) bridge going South from Pensacola to Gulf Breeze.  Halfway across, at the crest of the bridge, we were startled to notice an immensely bright light approximately 200 yards away from us at roughly eye level (about 100 ft. off the water).  It was disc shaped and was emitting pulses of light, much like tracer fire, in a triangular array of about 30 degrees, and only traveling perhaps 4 diameters out away from the craft before the pulses stopped.  The effect was visually as if a dotted triangle was temporarily attached to a brightly glowing sphere.  This emission would go on for 10-15 seconds at a time, after which, it would stop and then recur anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes later.  I stopped immediately upon exiting the bridge and went to the edge of the bay to be able to watch with as little light pollution as possible.  When the lights were not emitting from the craft, it would fade to a dull, almost black, shade of red.  As it traveled East away from us, it would become difficutlt to track it visually while it was not in its' bright phase.  When it was approximately 5 miles from us, we noticed another craft, also pulsing identical light emissions, approaching the first from about 45 degrees to the the North.  The two never got closer than a couple of miles from each other.  Approximately 10 minutes had gone by at this time.  Immediately after noticing the second craft, we noticed a third approaching the first from about about 30 degrees from the South.  At this point, the emissions were coming less frequently, and we could only be sure of the exact location of all three craft when they would emit, which they did not do in unison.  When they reached roughly the current location of the Garcon Point bridge (approximately 10 miles from our vantage point, they all three dissapeared at the same time. I am a college graduate, do not drink or use drugs, and am an avid fisherman in the area, so I am very confidnent of my distance estimates.

The witness who first called was not satisfied with our rendition of what he had reported over the telephone, so we requested that he submit a written version of the sighting, which appears here.

Orange sphere.;2015-10-13 19:10:00;2 minutes;Noticed in East direction a Orange Sphere moving South from a North direction.  The sphere appeared to have something resembling sparks that would leak from it.  Followed object until it suddenly vanished.  (Note: I know what flares look like this was not a flare);30.3879326530612;-87.0622775510205
