The bright lights were brighter than anything ive seen and lighted the clouds up all around them.  The objects appeared to be staionary and i counted between 7-10 of them.  They apeared remained still for 5 to 10 min. and dimmed out one by one.  The first few were in a straight horizontal line and spaced uniformly. Near the end of the event a  couple more bright objects apeared above this line.  I wittnessed this with my neighbors and their child on a dock along the west side of Santa Rosa Sound near the Tiger Point community just east of Gulf Breeze.  I am a college student and have lived here 1 year. This was my first ufo sighting.  (and it was cool:));30.3879326530612;-87.0622775510205
