Upon reading your website today and finding that i am not the only one to have seen this i thought I would reprot it.I hope you can determine the cause of this....its really odd the objects were golden in color and appeared in the eastern sky not too far from the horizon. that area is over Pensacola Bay. The lights lingerd gor some time ...approx. 3-5 seconds. within about 5 min they appeared again...4-5 orb at different intervals ( within milli seconds ) rose up only to hover and dissappear. the phenomenon ended after the second time. ( or we diamissed it and didn't pay attention to it) I thought they might be flares or fire works, but my fiancee ( an ex coat gaurdsman) assured me that flares leave trails... these did not. The orbs were very bright and seemed to be devised to catch someones attention...as in a flare.;30.3879326530612;-87.0622775510205
Navarre / Gulf Breeze birght orange fireballs horizontally aligned;2006-01-04 19:30:00;10 minutes;Navarre / Gulf Breeze birght orange fireballs horizontally aligned I was out on the porch and saw what I thought was fireworks behind a tree. About 45 seconds later, I got a better, unobstructed view to the left - it was the same bright orange lights, but they appeared to be lighting up in a row from right to left. The lights never rose or fell, only lit up like balls of fire, remained lit for several seconds, then disappeared. I was knocking on the window to try and get people to come out. The lights showed up again even further to the left - this happened seven or eight times. One other person came out in time to see the entire final display - this last time was the clearest, and it looked like six balls of fire that lit up on a horizontal line (right to left), then disappeared - not moving up or down, just disappearing. Lots of airplanes were visible shortly afterwards, and one in particular that was moving in a large circular pattern. There was never any noise that I could distinguish as being associated with the lights.;30.3879326530612;-87.0622775510205
