I saw this thing it was real.No sound but the sound of birds going to roost for the night. I used my Phone to video it, I saw a large  Orange round shape in the sky , it was glowing. It had a half moon glow, less orange, half way around the circle, it.  It moved slowly to the left.  Above residential homes,  My hands were moving as I was walking my dogs. It really glowed, then it grew smaller. The half moon glow dissapeared,  It still pulsated.  It changed shaped slightly and changed colour.  It turned white but had other colour's glowing around the outside of the ball. Red, Blue, Purple, Yellow.  It changed and grew smaller, it still moved slowly.  It dissapeard with out a trace.  I heard no sound it was not a plane, it was not a helicopter.  It did not act or behave the way a helicopter or a plane behave's.;30.3879326530612;-87.0622775510205
