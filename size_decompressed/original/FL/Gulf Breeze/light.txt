This point of light was undiminished by the Moon and was as bright as Jupiter... magnitude -1 or so... I am an amateur astronomer... Because of the speed and brightness of the light I suspected ISS at first but ISS was not expected until after 8 p.m. and in the NNE according to heavensabove.com. This light shifted to white and brightened considerably as it traveled low in the southwest to southeast. This light was not a jet... too fast actually... but it was moving in the direction of Eglin Air Force Base. I really don't believe it was a jet because of its peculiar lighting and fast movement. It flared like a satellite too...but it just didn't seem like a satellite.  I may have seen the so-called Eglin space plane... mentioned in some aviation circles. I double-checked with heavensabove.com and found no satellite activity noted at that time. I have 45 years of amateur astronomy under my belt and I am quite sure this was not a satellite or jet... I think it was a space plane project...  Anyway...Peter keep up the good work and God Bless. ((NUFORC Note:  Note flawed date.

Brighter than a star light travels the clear night sky, viewed by 6 adults for around a minute, then it just disappears.;2019-06-08 22:00:00;1 minute;brighter than a star light travels the clear night sky, viewed by 6 adults for around a minute, then it just disappears. On Sat night, the 8th of June 2019, my wife, myself, & 2 other couples (6 people) were hanging out talking on the back porch of a friend's house.  We were talking of how Jupiter was supposed to be so close we could see the moons with a pair of binoculars, so we decided to pull up our skyview apps on our iphones to look at stars & try to find Jupiter.   At about 21:45 we began to spot communication satellites traveling the night sky, they were all over, as well as the occasional high flying airplanes.  You can always tell the airplanes from the blinking lights on each wingtipâ€¦ One of the men in the group notices a light in the sky, like a satellite, only brighter, almost as bright as the N star.  It was travelling from the S to the N faster than a satellite, almost double the speed of a satellite as viewed with the naked eye, it had no blinking lights, it was too high to be heard, but it was quite clear in the NE sky that night, so no clouds to obscure it.  I remarked at how it kind of had a blue blur behind it, almost like it was going so far it was getting blurry near the end.  It was viewed by all six adults over the age of 35, no one was intoxicated, all sober.  It traveled the sky in a straight line for around a minute, about 1' across the sky viewed by eye, it stayed a constant speed, then phased out...totally disappeared, no explosion, no giant flash...it was there, then it wasn't.   We've tried to explain it off, as we live near some high profile military bases, but somethings, somethings just can't be explained.;30.3879326530612;-87.0622775510205
