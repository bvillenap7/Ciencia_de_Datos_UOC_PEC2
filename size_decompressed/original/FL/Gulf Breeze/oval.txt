brightness, changing shape, light trail;2009-05-27 00:00:00;10min;brightness, changing shape, light trail i woke in the night, went out side to smoke a cig, and drink coffee. it was above the trees a few miles away. brighter than any star. it hoovered then changed shape and went away. with a light trail behind. I awoke my husband, he said as long as they wern't in our back yard, that we would be fine. i checked again, and it was surly gone. i want to know if i was the only  person inthis area to have sen this. plus the airplanes landing in this area seemed to have no effect.;30.3879326530612;-87.0622775510205
