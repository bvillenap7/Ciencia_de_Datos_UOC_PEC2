Triangular shaped object with red & white lights at each corner and a hyper-blue light eminating from the underside;2008-04-20 21:00:00;30 minutes;Triangular shaped object with red & white lights at each corner and a hyper-blue light eminating from the underside A triangular shaped object was seen in the western sky over the gulf of mexico. The object was viewed with the naked eye and only a hyper-blue white was eminating from the underside of the object. When viewed through 8x21 binoculars the object appeared to have red and white lights at each of the 3 corners in addition to the hyper-blue type light coming from the underside. The blue light would get brighter and dimmer but the red and white lights remained constant.  The object hovered for at least the 30 minutes that it was viewed with very little movement. When fixing a position and then viewing the oject in comparison to the fixed point the object remained at approximately the same location with very little movement. In checking online there were reports made in March 2008 with the Pasco County Sheriffs office by others but seemed to be explained away as an aircraft. What was seen in the sky by myself and one other observer on 04-20-08 was not any type of craft ever seen in our lives.;28.2987000000001;-82.6902000000005

Unidentified craft was flying soundless below an airplane at a low altitude, and behind it traveling northbound.   Then it veered left, westward, in a very short arc at a rate of speed I have never seen before.  Extremely fast and again, no sound.   The craft was a dark colored triangle or wing shaped with two very dim orange colored lights on the tips.   The background of the area was dark as it was about 10:30pm.   Overall the sighting lasted 5-7 seconds until it was out of sight.;28.2987000000001;-82.6902000000005
