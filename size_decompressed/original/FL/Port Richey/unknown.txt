Bright Lights Above Port Richey.;2005-09-29 20:00:00;1 hour;Bright Lights Above Port Richey. The object remained in same position in SW!  At about 50 degrees in the sky.  It appeared as solid white light and then appeared as three white lights.  I am an amature astronomer so I know it was not a planet or star.  Mars is the brightest planet visable now and it is in East and is not bright white.  It also doesn't change to a different configuration.   I am a member of the Slooh astonomy group and also have taken several pictures of the moon so I have a good understanding of what is in the night sky.  This was not anything normally seen in the sky.  This is te second time I have seen the object.  The first was two days ago (Tuesday) in the same position about at the same time.  There were other small aircraft in the sky but much lower than the unidentified craft.  At times the lights (Very biright) were white at times yellow.   Please visit my astonomy website to see some of my pictures. ((e-address deleted));28.2987000000001;-82.6902000000005
Driving south on US19 at intersection to turn left at Regency Park Blvd. Port Richey FL. There were multiple power lines.;2013-12-17 15:09:00;2 minutes;Saw this driving south on US19 at intersection to turn left at Regency Park Blvd. Port Richey FL. There were multiple power lines and this “thing” was between the power lines (double lines above and out of view).  A math genius should be able to compute height and perhaps size/distance using the lie of the lines and the following information.   Taken with Canon 260IS with no adjustments f6.8, 1/1000, ISO 100.  Maximum digital magnification of 80x. 12/17/2013 at 15:09:33.  It appears to be two objects colliding (naked eye saw more like 4 solids) the strange part is that a plane or meteor should have had longer tails also I was at stop light for about 2 minutes and this object did not change in anyway nor appear to move.  Line of sight says was well over the Gulf of Mexico.;28.2987000000001;-82.6902000000005
Sonic boom denied by military source per McDill AFB, Lt Patrick Gargan. Reports by 911 from Holliday to Spring Hill Fl (about 40 miles);2014-05-07 09:30:00;1 second;Sonic boom denied by military source per McDill AFB, Lt Patrick Gargan. Reports by 911 from Holliday to Spring Hill, Fl (about 40 miles) also reported in Tampa Bay Times sec 3B front page at bottom.   Was very loud rattling dishes and too many witnesses for military to not have on radar.  So, either military lying or something else involved.   No real reason for military to deny such an event as plane breaking sound barrier.
