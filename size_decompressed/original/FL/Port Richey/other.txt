Unique Flying Boomerang Seen !;2005-09-28 05:52:00;3 Seconds;Unique Flying Boomerang Seen ! Keep in mind what I saw broke out of the dimension of space itself, was red only to the fact that the red part of the ufo was only like an outlined cartoon drawing, drawn with a red marking pen.  It was huge, moved quickly, and was a distint Boomerang shape.  The Boomerang shape moved just like a boomering would be thrown in a cartoon drawing.  Flat, with no dimension to it.  When I saw it, I thought, a flying red tiger.  It did startle me at first. But it never hurt me, or landed either too. So what did I see?  Does it matter.  Not really!   My self I am just an average person with a penchant for Jesus, and his Father God Almighty!  I have been seeing the lights in the sky since age 8.  And you know what, depite my faith, I still see these objects around us almost daily.  Thank You ((name deleted)).;28.2987000000001;-82.6902000000005
