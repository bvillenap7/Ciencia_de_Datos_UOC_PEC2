Silver Egg Shaped craft;1994-08-07 17:00:00;15 seconds;Silver Egg Shaped craft After shooting some baskets in my driveway. I took a seat on the back bumper of my car. I was checking out the clouds. They were giant cotton balls in the sky not high either. While looking north west. a metallic egg shaped craft just beneath the clouds heading south came across my field of view.  I was able to watch it go into a cloud out the otherside then into another cloud which blocked my view and I was unable to see it anymore. entire sighting took 15 seconds. the craft was low and about the size of my thumb with my hand held out at arms length.  The skin of the craft was smooth also there was a layer of heat or something radiating around it.. it looked like the heat you see radiating from the hood of your car when the engine is hot.. craft was going maybe 400 to 500mph totally silent!
