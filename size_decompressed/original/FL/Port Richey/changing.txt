Color changing twinkling orb.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Venus??  PD));2020-05-13 21:07:00;15 minutes;color changing twinkling orb I went into my back yard to take my dogs out around 9:00 pm and as I stood on my patio I noticed a strange light in the sky at about 245 degrees west,(I checked my phone's compass because I texted 2 friends to see if they could also see it) and about 20 feet up if looking at the horizon line ( but it was far in the distance) at first I thought it was a plane because it was twinkling green and red but after a few minutes it did not move.  I had seen it the night before but went inside to find binoculars and when returned it was gone so I had disregarded it as a plane that I mistook. however, tonight, 2 nights in a row I have seen this strange object in the same exact spot. This time, I had my phone on me so I took video footage of it and sent it to 2 of my friends. In the video the colors are clearly changing between green, red, blue and purple. One of my friends also saw it and sent me a video back, however she saw several of these objects.  I was able to get my binoculars and it was very bright and the colors changed rapidly. I turned my back to let my dogs back inside and it was gone.;28.2987000000001;-82.6902000000005
