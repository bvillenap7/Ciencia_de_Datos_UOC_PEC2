Erratic moments green and red lights.;2016-10-05 21:25:00;2 minutes;Erratic moments green and red lights. Hovering and making abrupt movements before descending.  Green and red lights flashing. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) 3 times as bright as Venus when it's low in the sky.  Pretty big in size too Looked like a low jet coming in except it wasn't moving.  It took off vertically, claimed very high at a high rate of speed then just stopped for a period.  Then dipped below the trees in the distance. I thought maybe a quadcopter type of device.  But when it was still it was dead still.  Very windy here with hurricane Mathew looming!  Not sure a quadcopter could handle the winds like this craft did but I could be wrong.  Also, the light pattern was unlike what I'm seeing on YouTube.  It had a fast blinking plain green/red light.  More like a normal aircraft. ((END ADDENDUM));28.2987000000001;-82.6902000000005
