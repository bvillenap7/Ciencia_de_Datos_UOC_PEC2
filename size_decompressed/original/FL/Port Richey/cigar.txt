West Coast Florida;2008-01-01 18:00:00;2 seconds;West Coast Florida At around 6pm this evening, I was taking down Christmas Decorations in front of the house.. I looked North west and in the Distant sky I saw a very bright white cigar shaped object it had a clearly defined sharp outline. and as if you were shutting off a light with a light switch it was gone. I did not see it move.. it was just gone. sighting only lasted maybe 2 seconds.;28.2987000000001;-82.6902000000005
