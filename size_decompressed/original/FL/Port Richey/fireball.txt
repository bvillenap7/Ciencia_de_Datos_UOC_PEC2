Bright Orange Sphere wobbling while Bright White Led Looking Light remains constant nearby.;2011-12-31 23:15:00;ten minutes;Bright Orange Sphere wobbling while Bright White Led Looking Light remains constant nearby. At 1115pm there was a Fireball at about my seven o'clock looking north. At my nine'oclock there is still and ongoing a bright white led looking light hovering.  It's not a star since the stars are twinkling and they stand out as stars.  This craft seems to be moving or wobbling from right to left. Several fireballs seem to be within 25 or 50 miles of the constant light.  Since its new years eve and there a5re constant fireworks going on You can see clearly it isn't part of the show.  Very eerie, like a helicopter many miles above our home with no sound.;28.2987000000001;-82.6902000000005

Several fireballs coming in from the northwest look like it may of been an aircraft on a glide-path then became very bright like the sun with high definition of orange and then began to climb to a higher altitude and the light ceased.  Its on going.  I reported just a half hour ago and while the firework show was going on at my two o'clock the fireballs were at my ten o'clock.  I was looking due north that would be my 12 o'clock   Was no firework or plane or white light being obscured by the smoke in the air from the fireworks.  Our T.V was acting up like there was some sort of interference and we have cable.At arms length the object appeared to be the size of a half of a pencil eraser while the moon looked like the size of a bottle cap. There was a shooting star while I was making this report the size of a BB that illuminated the color of Teal and white and gold trail.  Fireworks have ceased. Lots of sightings ongoing and now its been a full hour.;28.2987000000001;-82.6902000000005
