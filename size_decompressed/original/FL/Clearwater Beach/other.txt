UFO Near Scientology building/church in Clearwater FL;2008-01-10 00:00:00;10 Seconds;UFO Near Scientology building/church in Clearwater FL After making dinner I walked my dog before getting ready for bed. I live near the intercoastal so I always am looking into the sky around this time. However, when I walked outside I stopped at stared at a bright white star in the sky but to low to be a star. Im not sure how long it was there, but when i looked at it, it then shot straight down at light speeds and disappeared in mid air.  There was also a stranger in the parking lot on his cell phone. He hung up and we both said, What the **** was that?! We both stared in shock.  The circular white ball formed into two white balls and looked like a division symbol in the sky.  It had one large dot then a line in the middle and then another dot directly behind the other as it shot towards earth.  However, it looked like it would have landed close to the intercoastal waters or around the area where that scientology church is located in clearwater.  This thing went directly down and had no trail whatsoever, so we ruled out a comet. I am young, in great health and have no vision problems and do not follow scientology or science fiction.  This is one of the oddest things ive seen and has inspired me to do some online research like this.. But what was odd was that, whatever it was, it looked like it would have hit somewhere very close to that scientology building.  A few minutes later I heard an odd siren across the waters, they didnt sound like police sirens and were very brief... The hairs on my back and neck stand up when I think about it.
