Orangish slowly moving cone shape that shot off into the distance & disappeared in Tampa, FL.  ((anonymous source));2019-05-24 23:05:00;23 seconds;Orangish slowly moving cone shape that shot off into the distance & disappeared in Tampa, FL We saw an orange like glow, and at first, I thought it was one of those lanterns that you light, and let off into the sky.  But then we noticed that it had a tail on the end. It looked like it was very close to us, seeing as how the orange color was so dominant.  It kept getting closer, yet was slowly hovering above the houses...then at that point i thought maybe it could have been a drone since it was moving so slow.  The orange color was still present, and appeared to be coming closer.  I walked over to get a better glimpse, and within seconds, it turned to the right and shot off into the sky.  It was completely gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
