Cheveron craft over Tampa, FL;2008-04-25 00:00:00;20 seconds;Cheveron craft over Tampa, FL The object was chevron shaped.  There were 3 dim lights, one in front and one on the tip of each wing.  You could see the grayish outline of the craft as it flew over.  It made no sound and was moving quickly to the North East.  My dog looked up, which made me look up to see this thing flying over.  I would say the wing span was that of a DC-10 and was about 1,000 feet up.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

I was in a parking lot close to Waters Ave. and Anderson Rd facing E, 1 mile North of Tampa International Airport. ((anon.));2015-10-01 21:40:00;15 seconds;I was in a parking lot, close to Waters Ave. and Anderson Rd., facing East, one mile North of Tampa International Airport.   The air traffic is always heavy but has its dull moments.  During a slow moment of air traffic I saw what I thought it first to be a flock of birds in a wedge or chevron formation.  Within a second or two I realized it was not birds.  It was a fuzzy, white mist like boomerang with the ends of the leading edges curved inward like a comma.  I tried to pull my phone out of my pocket for a picture but couldn't take my eyes off of it.  As it passed to the south, I had to jog to the north in the parking lot.  I was losing my line of sight for the warehouse roof to my right/south, but still didn't get a picture. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
