Because the family was from Winnipeg Manitoba Canada, we were staying in Tampa Bay Florida for half the duration of our trip (2 weeks)to Florida.  The other week was to be spent at bush gardens at a different hotel.  The hotel we were staying at was called the The Sonyesta.  On or around the night of 19 Dec 1987 we decided to visit a restaurant called King Henry's Feast in Miami.  We left the hotel in Tampa at around 16:00 on the 19th and drove to Miami.  The King Henry's Feast was a Medieval style dinner and show and the whole affair lasted many hours so by the time we left Miami to go back to our hotel in Tampa bay it was quite late, around 0:00. At around 1:00 am we were on a deserted stretch of highway near - as far as I can remember- swampy country with scattered palm trees.  Because it was somewhat dark I can only remember seeing flat ground with telltale plantlife that indicated swamp such as sparsh high grass, rushes and bumpy, in some places, reflective ground indicating stagnant water in addition to the dark outlines of palm trees.  I remember that the moon was full when we left Miami but at 1:00 on the highway it became foggy. My memory becomes hazy at this point, but I recall other cars stopped by the road and people looking at something in the sky.  I recall the other passengers in the car gasp and say oh look!.  I recall seeing three other people besides the passengers in our car.  The other peoples cars seemed to have headlights on. The passengers of our car consisted of 4 people.  Firstly myself age 7.  I was at that age an avid camper with my parents and that is how I knew what swamp looked like.  I am now 28 and a Captain in the PPCLI, a Canadian Infantry unit and I have seen action in Afghanistan.  My father is a doctor who practiced at the St James Clinic and Misecordia hospital in Winnipeg, Manitoba Canada.  My Mother was or was studying at the time, to take her bar exam.  She has been called to the bar in Winnipeg and British Columbia Canada.  She no longer practices law but is a stay at home Mom for my younger siblings who were not yet born at the time.  The final passenger was my Dad's mother and my grandma who is now deceased but at the time worked at a clothing store for senior citizens in Winnipeg. My Father and Mother were in the front 2 seats of the car and my Grandmother and me in the back.  As we approached what I remember to be one or two cars pulled over at the side of the road with people beside them I perceived 6 light blue glowing lights rotating in the sky.  Each was the size of a quarter in my memory, but only because they were some distance away.  I seem to recall we got out of the car at this point to look at the lights but I have another memory of staying in the car the whole time.  The lights did nothing but rotate, in my memory at an angle and down towards our car.  The whole scene-like a picture- was us, bottom right ground, road bottom middle, other people and cars bottom left.  Mid right was shadow of palm trees, mid center was fog but flat bumpy ground, mid right was fog, top right fog, top center fog with some traces of moonlight seeping through and top right were the six blue lights rotating at an angle facing us. I do not recall how long we lingered watching the lights but at some point during this time I recall glancing out of curiosity at the other people near our car and to our left to see if they were as amazed as us.  I recall a man with shaved head and glasses in a white shirt looking calmly back at me with an amused expression.  I have conlicting memories of this man one memory that he was in another car and I saw him through a window and another memory that he was outside the cars to my left at about 9 feet away. At this point I draw a blank and do not recall if the lights disappeared or we just got bored and decided to leave.  We got back to Tampa Bay and had no other encounters since.  After returning to Canada at the end of the vacation we did not discuss at all afterwards memories of the vacation.  Anytime I brought up the issue of the lights my mother scolded me, dismissed the event or made fun of me so I soon let the matter drop. Upon remembering this event last year in September 2007, I questioned my father and mother at a restaurant and it took them by surprise.  I said simpley do you remember the 6 blue rotating lights in Florida?  My father remarked off hand (and without any prompting from me) that there were lots of people watchig the event.  My mother then remarked that she had no memory of other people there.  We were all 3 of us discussing the event further in the car and my mother became very agitated and angry while my father seemed very curious and trying to remember more, or so it seemed to me.  My Mother did give me a detail I had not remembered-my Grandmother had decided to purchase communion which was a book about alien abduction.  My Mother told me all this nonsense about UFOs was due to my Grandmother scaring me.  I do not recall ever discussing the event with my Grandmother at all. Please let me know if anyone has had a similar experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
I viewed two bright white-colored objects for about 20-30 seconds just before dusk. The objects then vanished.;1998-03-07 18:45:00;30 seconds;I viewed two bright white-colored objects for about 20-30 seconds just before dusk. The objects then vanished. When driving up I-275 north to work Saturday evening, I saw two unusual bright white-glowing lights moving slowly in the north in the distant sky. It was was still daylight. I can verify Dr. Acker's report of “tails” appearing to stretch behind the objects. After observing these two lights for about 20-30 seconds, the trailing light vanished.  A few seconds later, the first light vanished.  They did not reappear.   From my viewpoint, the objects did not move in any unusual angles as others have reported.

Weird Lights In Tampa;2003-08-01 21:30:00;2 minutes;Weird Lights In Tampa I was heading to Tampa from Fort Lauderdale Friday night for a buisness trip with 2 friends. It rained most of the way but stopped about an hour south of Tampa. We were heading northbound on i-75 and I estimate the time to be around 9:30pm. We were still not in any metropolitan area, pretty much in the middle of nowhere.Off in the distance i saw a baby blue greenish and white light, spaced apart but on the same aircraft, which i took to be a helicopter. After a few seconds I look again and something about the way it was flying wasnt right. Just then my friend (the one was asleep in the backseat) in the passenger seat says,  do you see that? I acknowledged it was wierd. A few seconds later it was right over us comming from the west to the east toward the highway at a pretty high speed. As soon as it was directly over us it flipped, reversed and started heading west again finally shooting away. When directly over us it could have been no more then 100 feet way. When it changed directions, i know something was up and just as it was starting to head away i stuck my head out the window to catch a glimpse and could actually see the craft. It was FLIPPING head over end as it turned! It was a greyish dull metallic i could tell. But as too its shape it was hard to make out being that i was doing about 70mph and it too was moving. But probably an oval or saucer. It had a greenish baby blue light on one end and a white light on the other. Me and my friend started yelling at each other ,DID YOU SEE THAT ((deleted))! waking my friend in the back who slept through it all. Well there was about 4 other cars around me who all had to have seen the thing too. So thats why i say there are probably plenty of other witnesses. Some even were hitting there breaks when it came over the road. Weird stuff.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
It was circling another star and I ran inside to call everyone.;2004-05-22 08:30:00;a minute or two;Was walking my dog outside and it was already night time. Looking at the stars as usual I see a star like object moving. Im not sure if it was a satellite but it sure was moving fast and a little hard to see cause it was so high up. It was circling another star and I ran inside to call everyone. When they got outside it was gone so I continued walking the dog and everyone went in. I then saw the same object on almost the other side of the sky forgive my bad grammar. I live extremley close to MacDill Air Force base but this was totally different then the average jet or plane we see going by. Im not saying this was a ufo but this was definatley strange and different.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
Moving star that started out stationary and sped off at high altitude.;2005-05-15 22:00:00;1 minute;Moving star that started out stationary and sped off at high altitude. Looking east into the night sky at approx 45 degrees, I witnessed what appeared to be a faint distant star moving south.  The motion was slow and nearly undetectable in the first 10 seconds.   I stood up to examine the motion of the star more closely.  The object began moving more swiftly and I took a couple of steps forward to try and determine its altitude.  The object did not appear to be an airliner as the light did not blink or flash.   Approx 30 seconds into the event the object appeared to be accelerating away from me and gaining altitude.  I would put the altitude at between 30000 and 40000 feet.  The brightness of the object never changed.  After about a minute the light disappeared, still within plain viewing distance, but vanished.  Anyone else notice anything strange in the night sky on this date and time in Central Florida? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
Comet like object seen over South Tampa emitting red spheroids.;2006-01-21 00:00:00;15-20 minutes;Comet like object seen over South Tampa emitting red spheroids. While traveling north bound toward Tampa, Florida (crossing the Howard Frankland Bridge) on Interstate 275 my wife and I witnessed a strange UFO.  We were about little past midway across the bridge when my wife, who is very skeptical about UFO's in general commented, What is That up there?   What she noticed was a strange twinkling light (changed from reddish to yellow and white very quickly) over what appeared to be South Tampa. The object was approximately 45 degrees above the horizon and was slightly descending in a tight corkscrew pattern.  Suddenly the light was emitting glowing red balls that were larger than the object and with a much brighter luminosity. These lights seemed to descend to different altitudes before disappearing.  When I saw this I thought that they may have been doing exercises off of the back end of MacDill Airforce base and that the balls might have been flares but these balls did not remain luminous for a long period (a few seconds).   Then the object made the most stunning emission of what looked like a flood of sparks. It took on the appearance of the classic comet type of configuration and moved in lazy circles speeding up and slowing down becoming more luminous and less luminous. I was hypnotized by the object. It was very beautiful. I asked my wife, who was driving, how would you describe that and she commented, It looked like fireworks.  I tried to notice the turns this object was making and the sudden turns and decreases in speed were amazing. The object continued to emit this flood of sparks and move in a lazy corkscrew while speeding up and slowing down.  During this observation we noticed that a bright light of white yellow color split from the head of the object and rejoined a few seconds later. The observed event lasted approx 10- 15 minutes when we exited on Westshore Blvd.  The buildings obscured the view of the sky.  It may be of important note that the annual Gasparilla Parade was taking place in Tampa this evening, though I am not sure the times.  I am very interested to know if anyone else submitted a report.  My background-I am a 41 year old Graduate Student in History and my wife is 32 and a Graduate student in Library Science. We are both completely sober and do not drink or smoke. ((NUFORC Note:  If anyone can identify the object, we would welcome additional information about this incident.  We wonder whether it might have been caused by an aerobatic display, performed by an aircraft with pyrotechnic devices on its wings, but that is just a guess, one of many possibilities.

At 2 am in Tampa Fl I saw 2 different UFO's;2006-02-19 02:00:00;1hr;At 2 am in Tampa Fl I saw 2 different UFO's I was watching tv when I heard some splashing in the bay outside my bedroom window. I went outside to take a look and saw some fish splashing. Then I looked up in the sky and saw at first what appeared to be 2 airplanes. One was at 12 o'clock and one was at 3 o'clock.(This was the position in the sky) So I kept looking at them and they were not moving. So I thought maybe helicopters or so. I went to get my binoculars and when I looked thru them the first one (12o'clock) appeared to be green and red lights circleing a white light. Then I looked at the 3o'clock one and that was a solid red. I went back in and woke my wife to show her. Although she could see exactly what I described she wasn't sure of what she was seeing. It was a pretty clear night and the rest of the stars were way farther away and not nearly as bright as these two. I looked at all the stars thru my binoculars and they all looked like stars. I think my wife started believing her eyes when after a long long time the two ? started moving very slowly but in seperate directions. The one at 12 o'clock went straight out toward the horizon and the 3 o'clock one went on the same height straight out to the right. The rest of the stars did not move in the same pattern as these two ??. After watching them for awhile the 12 o'clock one seemed to turn sideways and the lights were rotating fast. My wife and I both agreed that this could not be anything other than a UFO sighting. I have never seen anything ever before in my life that looked like this. In fact before this I was not sure how I really felt about UFO's. I figured that it was possible but highly unlikely. I am not a nut and I own my own successful business. After last night  (actually early this morning) I believe 100% that what my wife and I saw was in fact UFO's.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
Large diamond or saucer-shaped obect just north of Tampa, FL with red flashing lights top and bottom and white lights at ends.;2006-02-26 19:30:00;25 - 30 mins;Large diamond or saucer-shaped obect just north of Tampa, FL with red flashing lights top and bottom and white lights at ends. Beginning at approximately 7:30pm EST I noticed a odd configuration of lights west of my location which would just to the north of the Tampa International airport.  There were two alternating flashing red lights on top of each other and white non-flashing lights to the left and right about 2.5 to 3 times as far apart as the red lights.  The red and white lights formed an elongated diamond shape (I was never able to make out any physical shape).  I observed the grouping of lights remain stationary for about 5 mins and then they collectively drifted very slowly in a northward directly a short distance and stopped again.  They maintained the same position this time for about 20 mins.  Then, the grouping of ligths dipped slightly clock-wise relative to my position and the object drifted to my right (northward) again, tipped sligthly in a counter-clockwise direction and then moved very quickly in a west or south-west direction, disappearing over the horizon directly west of my position within about 3 or 4 seconds.  About 10 seconds later I saw plane fly over heading in the exact direction of the object moving very quickly relative to other routine air traffic in the area (looked like a fighter jet).  Possibilities ruled out for object: traditional airplane - too big and stationary for 20 mins, grouping of helicopters - none of the individual lights ever changed position relative to the others (not even remotely) and object moved too fast to be a helicopter or multiple helicopters, blimp - far larger than any blimp I've ever seen and moved much faster than a blimp when it did move, hot air ballon - don't think so, lights on building - buildings and radio towers don't move.  I was working late on a Sunday so the other person around was the security guard on duty who also witnessed the object.  Address of sighting: XXXX E Palm Avenue Tampa, FL 33605 looking west-northwest.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
strange colored light in the sky that vanished;2008-04-12 22:30:00;5 min;strange colored light in the sky that vanished Not sure what I saw, but I saw it 2 different times tonight.  The first sighting was around 20:00 TO 21:00.  The first time was just after sunset, thought it couldve been the reflection of the sun on an airplane.  The color was bright oarange/red, very strange.  The flight path was odd as it climbed quickly and soon was out of sight.  My wife was witness to this 1st sighting.  The second sighting was the same color, same sort of light and shape.  The light was in the same place as the 1st time, which made me again think it couldve been a plane taking off from Tampa Intl Airport or St. Pete Clearwater, but it was too high to be St Pete Clearwater.  The light again disappeared into the sky.  I am not sure what I saw, but if others saw something thing strange than so be it.  I should also mention that this was in the general direction of Mcdill AFB. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Street lights went black and a strange blueish-white light came down from the sky;2008-08-03 22:00:00;5 seconds;Street lights went black and a strange blueish-white light came down from the sky Myself, and my children were heading North on the Veteran’s Expressway in Tampa, approximately 3 miles south of the SR 54 exit.   At approximately, 10pm we were driving in the left hand land and all of a sudden all of the street lights on the Expressway went off and a blue beam of light went across the highway.    However, the light wasn’t like normal flood light or spot light you would see.  The light actually stopped in mid-air, it didn’t travel like normal light should.   It was the craziest thing I had ever seen and it wasn’t a normal color either--it was a strange blueish-white light.   My boys said it before I could even muster the words out of my mouth, Is that a UFO? he exclaimed from the rear seat.   I was in shock, I didn’t even know what to say.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

We saw 2 reddish balls in the sky east of us kind of low. (were not fireworks) (maybe near McDill Airforce base)   They were just there not moving much and one finally flew off towards the northwest.  It was not close enough to see any details of the red globe.  We could not see the other light after that.   We took a picture.  It is not a real good picture since we did not have a high powered camera but there is clearly a round red ball visible.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

At the redlight i happened to look up at the birds in the sky when i noticed this weird looking object it almost looked like a manmade plane but i could not see anyone on it looked like it couldve been brown in color and maybe the size of a dune buggy.  It moved quickly in a matter of a minute it had already moved to the next block did not hear no sound but i did see a quick flash or reflection off the object seemed like it got closer to land as if searching for something then it would go back up.  A weird experience it almost seemed like i was the only one paying attention during everyones morning commute .before reaching home object was still in the air.

No particular formation.  No particular order.  No flashing or blinking lights.  All uniform in color.   I have lived in the area for years.  This was not an aircraft headed to TIA.  Smallish in size.  The shape was probably round. It was about 9:30pm. We were in the parking lot at the Pizza Place near Sheldon and Citrus Park drive.  Four members of my family, and about six members of the other party.  Both groups questioned what the light were.  Some jokingly called the Home Depot buckets.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
Nearly Invisible and silent UFO outline hovering slowly, Arch shaped.;2020-12-11 19:30:00;10 seconds;Nearly Invisible and silent UFO outline hovering slowly, Arch shaped. Tonight was a clear and beautiful night, no clouds in the sky that I could see. I was observing a white dot in the sky, looked like a satellite moving slowly East and caught my attention. It wasn’t blinking, and looked very far away. No big deal to me, as I live by the Air Force base and witness lights and planes in the sky all the time. It was at night in the city by downtown, so the sky was dark, but it also had a very soft light glow. As I was continuing to watch the sky for a minute, I then noticed what looked like the faint edge of a craft almost directly in front and above me. It seemed almost invisible- and I can’t explain much of the exterior other than that. I thought it was a group of birds possibly flying in a line up high. When I looked closely, it was the edge of something very large, and flat. It had no lights. The strange thing was that it was moving very slowly and to the East. No abrupt flight patterns, but maybe a steady 200mph . It continu! ed hovering over buildings, and I lost sight. It was by far the strangest thing I have ever seen. I see military planes flying all the time, and this was something large. It made no noise, and was just moving slowly above.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
