I am not entirely sure how this may be related to black helicopter sightings that have occured  to various members of my family in the Charlotte area since the sighting described.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
Lightless,soundless sphere glides over tampa, 1:30 Sunday morning, Nov 18.;2001-11-18 01:30:00;30 seconds;Lightless,soundless sphere glides over tampa, 1:30 Sunday morning, Nov 18. I had crossed Henderson Blvd. about 1 mile south of Kennedy, I looked up into the eastern sky to see if I could find any meteors, the news reported they could be seen in the E-NE that night. A sphere was about 300-500 ft. up, it was glidding parallel to Henderson Blvd., it looked about the size of a beach ball, no lights, no sound, people across the street in in Walgrens parking lot did not seem to notice it. I was in Army Aviation 8 years and have not seen anything like it. I could make out its shape from the light that was reflecting off it, surface from the city below, it could of been very dimmly illuminated,but I don't think so, it glidded SSE and seemed to ascend as it went out of veiw, it moved the same speed the whole time watched, it took 30 seconds to move about 35-45 degrees toward the SSE. I have never seen anything like this ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is anonymous, but we believe he is the same person who called our Hotline.  We found him to be quite credible, and a very good witness.

Small flying blue orb of light about the size of a basketball;2002-06-26 21:00:00;1 minute;Small flying blue orb of light about the size of a basketball Me and a friend of mine were staying at a neighbors while they were out of town. After hangin out and watching t.v. for a while we went to the kitchen to find somethin to eat. While my friend was searching around in the fridge I glanced over at the t.v. which was right next to two big sliding glass doors overlooking a lake. As soon as I looked over I saw a blue orb comming down from the sky towards the house in a kind of J type descent about 200 yards away. It was traveling at an exceptional fast speed because as soon as I saw it comming down from the sky it was already about 6 feet away from me. It flew through the sliding glass doors as if they werent even there. I was just amazed...I stood there for about 10 seconds as it just hovered about 4 feet off the ground. It was about the size of a basketball and it was bright bright blue around the outside while the inside got progressivly lighter... a very pale blue...almost white.It was pretty much a basketball sized glowing sphere of light. I didnt feel scared, I had a sense of calmness once I snapped out of being completly in awe I slowly walked closer to it until I was about 2 feet away from it. I slowly reached out my hand to touch it for some reason..maybe because I felt that I had to know it was really there. I got about 3 inches from touching it and all of a sudden it went crazy! It started flying around the room in all sorts of directions up, down,  left, right.. at a very high speed. Then before I knew it, it flew back out the sliding glass doors and up into the sky. As soon as it left I turned to my friend and said DID YOU SEE  THAT!? since he was to busy looking around in the fridge he missed pretty much the whole event except for seeing something light blue fly out of the corner of his eye. Before that I was the type of person that didnt belive until I actually see for myself. Ive looked on the internet for years trying to find out what exactly it was...a spirt/ghost...an alien probe/scout... I have no idea...Ive only been a! ble to f ind a couple of articles that other people have reported on The Yukon Report. For whatever reason I have this feeling that one day I know I'll see it again.

A bright green sphere about the size of the moon shot across the sky in Tampa FL.;2009-04-07 21:45:00;1-1.5 seconds;A bright green sphere about the size of the moon shot across the sky in Tampa FL. Two friends and I were standing in a parking lot talking at around 21:30 in Tampa Florida. We were standing in roughly the shape of a triangle.  One of my friends, whose shoulders were almost parallel to the object’s path, got a really puzzled look on his face and pointed toward the sky.  I turned, my shoulders about perpendicular to the path, to see a very bright, light green object about the size of the moon traveling quickly from roughly south to north.  My second friend turned all the way around and saw the bright light travelling quickly behind the clouds. The object was definitely circular, possibly spherical.  It had a tail about twice the length of the object that gradually came to a point.  It was only visible for a second or two due to clouds and trees but I was able to see it cover about 40 to 50 degrees of sky (the angle created by pointing where I first saw it to where it went behind the clouds).  It looked very much like the green ball a Roman candle shoots but without any smoke.  There was no noise except that of the cars on the street and the wind blowing through the trees. I’m not sure what it was.  I grew up by an airport and have seen all different types of planes come in all types of whether at all types of angles and it was definitely not a plane.  I read that green meteorites sometimes occur but if it was, it was either big enough that I’ll be hearing about it on the news tomorrow or close enough that we would have an impact noise at least.  We were standing on church property, which is quite large, so short range fireworks are out of the question.  There is little to no likelihood that it was a big fire work due to the lack of noise and it was the only time we saw anything significant in the sky.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
Chilling, giant, bright, green ball of fire between Lakewood (Providence) and hwy 41.;2011-10-06 20:03:00;a matter of seconds;Chilling, giant, bright, green ball of fire between Lakewood (Providence) and hwy 41. I was driving down Lakewood(Providence) at night, listening to music, as usual.  As I was driving I'd gotten chills out of nowhere and looked around, my normal response to chills.  Thats when I'd noticed a giant, bright, green ball of fire in the sky, with a trail of green and white light coming off of the back of it.  It looked as if it were literally glowing green, and when I strained my eyes to observe it a little better, it seemed like there may have even been something black inside of it.  It had appeared to be falling from the sky.  Immediately, I'd turned down the music and turned to call my mom so I could make sure she, my son, and my family were okay, worried that it may have been falling towards my house...  But by the time I looked back up after dialing her number, it was gone.   This is not the first time I've seen a UFO incident, just the first time it's scared me enough to want to tell people, as well as the closest (even though it really wasnt very clos! e) I've ever seen anything like this.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

It had a tail, like a comet tail extending from the Sphere.  It appeared above the trees on Old Memorial Road, and seemed to be descending. We are retired. Both with college educations.

Orange circles  with many smaller circles within them .... changing to white random shapes.;2012-03-15 21:00:00;20 minutes;Orange circles  with many smaller circles within them .... changing to white random shapes Round orange glowing things above Tampa Bay seen from the opposite side (town of Rankin.. I think I have the name right)  They were hovering above the bay moving very slowly.  They would change from a near-perfect orange circle with smaller concentric circles within it to a bright white random shape (a blurry white shape), and then back to the orange circle. They didn't make any sound but we may have been too far away to hear anything. My wife and I saw them walking back to the hotel room over the Bay (there hadn't been any lights there any other night so they caught our attention). We got back to the room and went on the balcony and filmed them.  I wanted to send the footage to MUFON but the file is too large for me to email (it was in high def)  It is a bit shaky in parts but pretty good with some good close-ups. Maybe it was helicopters looking for someone in the bay...We dont know what they were but we still think about this a year later. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Glowing purple sphere remained stationary and then moved up and down until disappeared below tree line.;2013-12-31 23:00:00;10 minutes;Glowing purple sphere remained stationary and then moved up and down until disappeared below tree line Viewed from a condo balcony in town n country that overlooks Tampa from the NE edge of Tampa Bay.  5-10 miles off in the distance to the ESE was a glowing purple sphere that appeared to stay stationary hovering in the sky and then go up and down until it lowered below the tree line.  It re-emerged later after midnight doing the same thing for another 10 minutes.  It was somewhere between the TIA airport and Ybor City.  Fireworks were going off around it for New Year's Eve but it did not seem impacted by them and it was unclear how close it was to the fireworks due to the distance.  5 people on my balcony witnessed it as did several people on a neighbor's balcony.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

At approximately 11:30 pm, I saw 5 orange/red sphere (or firebalks) slowly moving from north to south accross the eastern sky;2015-07-21 23:35:00;3 minutes;At approximately 11:30 pm, I saw 5 orange/red sphere (or firebalks) slowly moving from north to south accross the eastern sky Late Tuesday night, July 21, 2015, around 11:30 pm to 11:45 pm I arrived home and got out of my car and across the field above the tree line in the low to mid part of the night sky I saw  five orange/red spherical/oval lights slowly moving across the eastern sky  from what seemed like a south to north direction. These lights were more or less in a line stretching  about a fourth of the way across the sky as I watched them slowly move southward.  They were not tightly spaced but had about same space between them: K One........Two.......Three/ Four (these two were one above the other with roughly the same ....... spacing, and seemed to be trying to get closer to each other) then........Five. They must have not been that far away from me because they were quite bright and bigger than stars. I don't know where they came from I just saw them there in that line slowly moving north. At a certain point (which oddly corresponds to where the visibility from my vantage point is unobstructed when  looking at that part of the sky), the light of first object suddenly went dark, and after that when each of those objects reached that part of the sky they too sent dark. It seems that they may have continued on but moving east now ( but I could not be certain).This sighting occurred in Tampa, but in the Temple Terrace/Thontosassa area. These objects moved slowly, and I estimate I watched this for at least three minutes. I wondered if anyone else saw them? As watched it felt almost like they were putting on a show just for me as it took so long. I looked on-line, and it may be possible they were some sort of sky lanterns ( Chinese lanterns) as they are that color and move slowly. I can't be certain. I did not hear of any being launched. But it is a possibility. I always look up at the night sky and have never seen anything like what I saw ever before. However, there was a night  in the  summer  of 2009 in which I saw on roughly that same area of the sky  where the lights went off  in last nights sighting a strangely churning white cloud ( at night).  I remember because I have NEVER seen a cloud churn and billow so fast.  On that night I got a chill because I was driving home listening to a man tell a story about Moses and the cloud appearing in the mountain, when, as I pulled into my driveway, I saw this strangely churning cloud directly in my line of vision.  It was late at night also and the synchronicity of what I saw  and heard made me run for cover inside my house. So for me, I guess,  that area of sky is indeed mysterious.  I softened wondered if behind that churning cloud was a mother ship.  Odd that the lights should disappear when they got to that part of the sky...;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
