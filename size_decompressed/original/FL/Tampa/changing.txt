They went up and down and covered a good distance in moments.  Then the larger of the two objects seperated into three and kept flying the same errratic flight in the same tight pattern that the two had made initially.  I stopped the car to see them better and did not see them again.  I am a school teacher in Ft Myers FL who has more than a passing interest in UFOs but cannot say for certain that I have ever spotted one before this.  My wife is a housemom.  What was odd about this was the length of time we were able to watch this. Because they were in constant motion and never kept one side facing us for any length of time it was hard to get a good look at the shape.  The closest description I could give would be spade shaped.  There were no lights or trails and the color appeared to be be between gray and black.  I heard about your site on Art Bell's show and hope to hear something about this there.  Hopefully someone was closer or able to see it standing still and was not going 80mph.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
odd shaped flying object;2008-11-06 15:30:00;5 minutes;odd shaped flying object I am a store manager for a large auto parts store.  I was outside the back door facing north having a cigarette.  I noticed The clouds and was looking at them when a glimmer caught may eye at about the 1:00 position.  The way the obect moved could only be described as fluttering, how a feather or a flat peice of paper would react if you dropped it.The object would catch the sun as it was fluttering and it was refelctive.It was hard to judge size or distance however the object would flutter, srtaighten out, fly in an arc, flutter, fly in an arc.The object did not appear to be losing altitude.I called an employee to witness this and he did. The object eventualy stopped fluttering and flew out of the area, underneath the clouds and was gone.If I had to judge size and distance based on the type of clouds I would have to say the object appeared triangular perhaps 10 to 15 ft and at an altitude between 500-1000ft.It was the middle of the afternoon,broad daylight,and nice weather.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
Moved like the Matrix fight scene;2017-06-21 21:00:00;25;Moved like the Matrix fight scene Me and my friend where sitting in the front yard and I noticed an object floating like what seemed like was a a balloon or some sort of odd thing floating through the sky. we watched it going down behind a house, but then it started to rise again and when it did it came right above us , and the shape was sort of oval, then it sped away and broke up into many pieces and then all of the sudden as fast as it sped off it came back in the shape of many Circles moving like a slinky toy (It reminded me of the movie the Matrix  during the fight Scenes  and the way their hands where moving) and it came right toward us. Since me and my friend was in my front yard, my friend started to run in the house, me I walked toward it, and it came toward me, then the UFO. Stopped right above me. It was like a circle with a red light in the middle we stared at each other for about I would say for about 5 minutes because I walked right up to it (it was about 5to10 feet above my he! ad, and then it turned and left the same way it came.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
Odd object off Tampa FL Coast Feb 26 2020 race off at high rate of speed;2020-02-26 00:30:00;10 seconds;Odd object off Tampa FL Coast Feb 26 2020 race off at high rate of speed Peter,  Avid listener of Coast to Coast, and I heard your broadcast from last Thursday, regarding the lady from Ypsilanti, MI who saw a daytime object zip across the sky, before just taking off at a high rate of speed.  You made mention there were several reports of this type of occurrence, and you encouraged others who have seen this to send you an email.  I first contacted you in late-February/early March 2020 to report a similar phenomenon while on a cruise, off the Florida coast.  My listening to Coast to Coast was a bit spotty at that time, so I never heard if my report made it on air.  However, what my friend and I saw was distinctively odd, and what happened after its brighter white light went dark/deeper into a cloud bank, and then a bright red dot came out of the white light's last position, and made three precise 90 degree turns before shooting up into the sky and out of sight caused me to again write to you to convey my story.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

The cross was positioned in a horizontal angle in the sky.  It was like a cross that was facing up. I considered grabbing my phone to record, but after hesitating to, it flashed and became a white circle. That’s when I grabbed my phone and took a quick video.  The bright circle looked extremely similar to a star, but I already knew it couldn’t be a star or planet. It not only had just been a bright orange cross that flashed and transformed, but it also was positioned lower in the sky and was slowly moving to the left. I followed it for a couple minutes as I drove.  I had never seen anything other than shooting stars and planets, so this was shocking to say the least! Very exciting when I understood what was happening though. Originally, I tried to rationalize the orange cross in the sky as a shooting star or meteor, but those don't resemble the bright orange cross that I saw at all. I would love to know if anyone else happened to see the same.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
