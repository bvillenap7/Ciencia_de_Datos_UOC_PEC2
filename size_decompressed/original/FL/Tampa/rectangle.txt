Huge rectangular object at 2:05 pm flying(or whatever) low and slow.;2004-12-15 14:05:00;3 minutes;Huge rectangular object at 2:05 pm flying(or whatever) low and slow. In Dec 2004 at approximately 2:05 p.m. I saw an object that I cannot explain.  While driving to work on the Crosstown expressway in Tampa, I noticed a strange rectangular craft in the distance, traveling in a NW direction.   At first I thought the craft may have been a balloon because it was traveling slow (about 60 mph) and was very large.  I first noticed it about 2-3 miles away while I was traveling 55 mph in my vehicle while going to work.  When I was about a mile away I noticed that it had no curves like you would expect a balloon (blimp) to have and the ends were squared off.  It was of a rectangular shape.  I never got close enough to get under it.  It maintained an altitude of approx 1000 ft. The altitude, speed and direction were all consistent and I could not notice any deviation in any axis.   I had a camera in my bag on the passenger seat next to me and I wanted to take a picture of it but I was unable to do so-weird I know but I just couldnâ€™t do it. Physical Description: The length was in excess of 500 ft (2-C-5 type transport aircraft parked end to end)  The height was in excess of 120 ft.  Since I retired from the USAF 5 years ago and have worked on many kinds of fighter, cargo and high performance reconnaissance aircraft, I sort of know what to look for in aircraft and below are my observations. The exterior was more rectangular shape with minor angled variances along the sides. The exterior composition had the appearance of sandy gray concrete. There were areas along the sides that that had several rectangular colored red and some orange areas. I specifically looked for any type of letters, symbols or markings which would indicate anything of significance and there were none. No windows, ports, hatches, panel lines or discoloration of surface could be made out from my closest approach (2,000 ft) were noticed.  No external pods, antennas i.e. long-wire, Radar-dish, directional, panel mounted, loop, adf, blade, towel-rack or anything that resembled an antenna was noticed. No engines or propulsion system of any kind were noticed nor any noise of any kind.  No electrical interference on my car AM radio was noted either.

Pale green pulsing light with dark rectagular core;2006-12-06 19:30:00;2min;Pale green pulsing light with dark rectagular core Suspect this was space shuttle, but can't confirm.   I was flying about 50nm north of Tampa, headed south, at 39,000'. I observed a slowly pulsing pale green light about 15 degrees above horizon near constellation Cetus.  Position, at first was static in relation to stars, then rapidly increased in elevation as would an aircraft on an opposite course to mine, well above my altitude.  Light was elongated verticaly, a very pale geen, and pulsed on at a very slow interval, 5 sec or more between pulses.  Could barely discern a dark core to the light that was rectangular, with long axis in the vertical. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

I my self have been questioned years ago for statements I made while in the Army Reserves while on active duty, as I followed and read Operation Blue Book material and made some quotes about an aircraft that crashed in upstate New York in the late 1970's. I have also seen things like advanced lazer technology with Huges Aircraft that would scare many people today! What I have come to understand is really simple. People do see things they can not explain or identify. But remember the F-117 first flew in 1969. The stealth single wing bomber around the same time. The F-71 Blackbird before that! Please tell me we haven't made any advancement in aircraft in nearly 40 years? I'm fully convinced of UFO's but of our advanced military. Are you seriously going to tell me, that people or beings flew lightyears accross the universe to put graffiti in our corn fields, but did't have enough intell! igents to leave a post card, or hack our primative internet to say What's Up? Or See Me, Feel Me Dude? Don't want to get to sarcastic, but please try a tiny bit of common sense. If NASA has already admitted in their park to flying 15 times the speed of sound 30 years ago, where do you think we are now? Think about computers, and cellphones and where they've come in 30 years. Hope you at least respond. I do not rule the possibility out completely, but at best it's a 1% or less shot. Mostly they wouldn't do graffiti.

The shape was alternating between floating slowly along, veering a bit to the right of the road, side to side, and then moving quickly beyond where the road would dead-end into a swampy area, back behind the tree line in the distance. It appeared to be coming down. It was broad daylight and I have to wonder if other drivers saw it as well, or how they could have missed it. It was matte gray and almost appeared fluid in its movement.  I thought it might be a weather balloon, but I am not sure a weather balloon would be rectangular.  I thought it might be a slowly falling satellite or something.  The rectangle had one vertical side slightly longer than the other. I am a mother of 4 who was on her way to pick up my 2 daughters from dance class.  I was  really worried as this object appeared to be descending. I was afraid it might fall on the building where my daughters were--although it did appear to be floating down, not actually falling. I can't judge the size of it because I am not sure how far away it was from me.  I only saw one face of the object.  It seemed to be following the path of a fairly busy suburban road, not a main highway.  But I watched it as I drove about 5 miles.   Once it had gotten out of my sight for about a minute and a half.  I do not know where it went, if it was behind trees and buildings or away.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
Apparently one dimensional grey rectangle floating low in sky in broad daylight, busy traffic, somewhat fluid looking.;2010-09-25 15:30:00;30 seconds;Apparently one dimensional grey rectangle floating low in sky in broad daylight, busy traffic, somewhat fluid looking. Driving in broad daylight down a busy road near university, hospitals, medical centers, VA.  This is the second time I have seen this.  It looks like a large rectangle, one dimensional, flying right over the tree line.  It is similar in appearance to a sign pulled by a plane, but close to square, not a long rectangular banner.  The color is gunmetal grey.  It seems a bit fluid in the wind, but maintains shape and corners.  No lights.  There is no airplane pulling it and nothing tethering it below.  It disappeared below the treeline as I was driving.  It was hard to keep an eye on due to the fact that there was quite a bit of traffic, just like the last time I saw it.  I am not crazy and was disturbed that I have seen it twice under similar circumstances.  I had never seen a UFO before or floating rectangles.  The sky was partially overcast both times, but a much lighter grey.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
