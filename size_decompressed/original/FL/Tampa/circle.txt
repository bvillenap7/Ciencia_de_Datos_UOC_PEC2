On this Tuesday night coming home from church in tampa fl on the church van.  We was going across the Courtney Campbell causeway.  I always like sitting by the window going home because I loved the night skies looking over the water.  This night we was coming across the bridge I was looking up at the  stars in the sky and saying to myself how beautiful their reflection look off the water and that is when I seen a pancake shaped object not too flat but it has rectangler size windows all around it with these lights just hovering over the water that is when I turn to my big sister and said look velma that don't look like a plane it is round shaped and that is when I said to her it look like a UFO ship to me and the moment I said that to her the object just strecked  across the sky and vanished into thin air.   I don't know why it took me over 25  years to report this, but it is still fresh in my mind like it just happen  yesterday.  I have told many people about this! some believed and some didn't, but I know what my sister and I seen that night.

I noticed because the jet was up on it's wing, with the top toward me! very unusual attitude. One, small? (half the width of the 727's wings, but a little larger that the tail wings) silver, disk-shaped followed directly behind the jet as it crossed Tampa Bay (I was travelling East into Tampa from St. Petersburg across the Gandy bridge). I noticed the airplane first, because it was practically perpendicular to the ground, up on the left wing (you are standing at the back of the plane facing the front). I could see the whole top of the airplane. I thought it was going to crash. Then I saw the disk behind --very close behind--the jet. I watched in amazement. Good thing there wasn't any traffic right around me, since I was driving. The disk seemed to have concentric circles on its top, since it looked textured, rather than just solid, shiny silver. Could this have been an optical illusion? I am not sure. I looked away to the road, and looked back. Still there. Looked away again, looked back, and the airplane was straightening out and descending to prepare to land. The disk was gone. Note that the location I was at and saw this is only about 3 miles from McDill Air Force base.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

A sighting of an apparent ball of flames turned into three smaller spheres... ((NUFORC Note:  Titan 4 launch from Cape Canaveral.  PD));2003-09-09 00:30:00;2 min;((NUFORC Note:  A launch of a Titan 4 rocket from Cape Canaveral  was conducted at 00:29 hrs. on this date.  We suspect that the launch was the cause of the several reports NUFORC received from multiple points in Florida.  We post the reports to illustrate how easy it is to misidentify a relatively commonplace event.  Even we were intrigued by the reports, when they first were submitted, and it took us approximately 12 hours to identify the apparent source of the reports.  PD)) A sighting of an apparent ball of flames turned into three smaller spheres forming a perfect triangle and disappeared into the sky. The sighting took place around 12:30pm from Tampa, Florida in the Eastern sky.  The initial object,traveling north to south, 4X the apparent size of Mars, was in the shape of a circular flame.  Attatched to this object was a tail of smoke 20X longer than the sphere itself.  This tail of smoke dissolved into the sky 10-15 seconds after the initial sighting.  The sphere stayed steady in the eastern sky for 5-10 seconds before it split into 3 seperate identical spheres of light.  These three spheres of light formed a perfect triangle and held the form of a triangle for close to 15 seconds.  The two left hand spheres quickly headed due east leaving small tails of smoke behind them and disappeared into the nigth sky.  The remaining sphere from the right slowly followed the other two to the east and kept in sight for around 30-45 seconds.  Suddenly the sphere disappeared for a second, came back into sight and quickly appeared to explode into the sky.  Total time of sighting: 2 minutes.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
Black Circular object flying high over tampa Florida;2006-07-12 17:15:00;5 minutes;Black Circular object flying high over tampa Florida It was about 5:15pm and my Girlfriend & I were on her back patio. She noticed a Black circular object and pointed it out to me saying what is that. I looked and couldnt tell either. The object appeared to be very high in altitude and was traveling south to north fairly slow. We both watched it for about 5 minutes as it got closer until it finnally was over her roof and we lost sight of it. She lives in a very populated part of Tampa Florida and there is alot of airplane traffic around her place. However, as we both watched I said there is no way that is a plane or a helicopter it was Just a Black Circular object. about 10 minutes later we went outside and saw a real plane. Seeing a real plane fly over definitly made me believe the object we saw was NOT an ordinary aircraft. I am a 28 year old Art Director and My Girlfriend is a 25 year old Insurance agent.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

Multi-colored illuminated circular object hovers near and crosses over busy interstate highway.;2010-01-24 19:40:00;5-6 minutes;Multi-colored illuminated circular object hovers near and crosses over busy interstate highway. I was traveling southbound on interstate 275 at 17:40 hours to go to a dinner party in St. Petersburg, when I saw 2-3 large and rapid flashes of light that covered the general vicinity of my location. I could not pinpoint the direction of flashes. At first I thought it may be lightening, but I had my moonroof open and I noticed that the cloud cover was broken and scattered at the time and there were no thunderstorms in the area. I thought this was odd, but I quickly disregarded it. The traffic flow on the interstate began banking to the right and heading in a west bound direction. After about 1.5 miles of going westbound, I noticed what appeared to be a commercial jet making a landing approach from over the bay waters, with landing lights. It made its approach over the shoreline in the general area of Bayshore and Hyde Park.  However, I then noticed that it seemed to be taking a long time for this jet to make its approach. I then slowed down and the lights seemed to be at a standstill and hovering  just short of the opposite lanes of the interstate expressway at about 300-feet in altitude and a quarter mile downrange from me. At about this time I then realized that what appeared to be landing lights took on a  rapid “twinkling” appearance as I closed distance on it. I then reduced my speed even more to get a better look and as I did, it went from a hovering standstill and then quickly “scooted” across all 8 lanes of I-275 in a matter of just a few seco! nds. As the object crossed over the interstate directly in front of me and all oncoming traffic, I then noticed that the entire middle of the object from end to end was illuminated in what seemed to be a grid of yellow, green and blue lights in a rotating pattern.  At this point, I thought It might be a blimp, but as I drove past it, to my dismay, I could clearly see that the lights were rotating around the circumference of a circle. There was no noise or any other anomalies. After it quickly “scooted” across the interstate it then stopped and hovered over an older and darker section of the city with few street lamps and when it did, the colors became very vivid and seemed to pop out visually and become brighter as they rotated rapidly around its circumference. I also noticed that rotational speed of the lights seemed to have varied becoming faster after it passed over my direction on the interstate.  As the object hovered in darkness, it then became apparent to me that this thing was big. I cannot even estimate a size in feet, but visually, It was the size of a nickel held at arms length in your hand.  As I was attempting to make a phone call to my spouse to tell her about what I saw (She has also seen lights of this description in the past), I looked over twice to see if it was still there and it did not move after it crossed the interstate.  Based on the rotation of vivid multicolored lights around its circumference and its ability hover, then! quickly pick up speed and have no noise, I am confident that this was not a regular aircraft.  I am at a loss to figure what it was and I am not sure if the flashes of light I had seen a couple of minutes earlier were linked to what I saw.

I was on my front porch this laying on my lounge chair facing the sky,  I saw a small circular disk snapped object that was white in color blending with the clouds as it silently traveled southbound from my view.  I'm use to jets, helicopters, and airplanes in the area most can be detected by their distinct noise trails, but this object was completely silent!  The size appeared small due to the distance I presume it had no smoke trail it flew perfectly straight at a speed that does mimic some known aircrafts but did not have the shape of know air vehicles.  fter the object passed maybe about five minutes later a jet passed in the same spot, but the jet was easily recognizable! It had a sound trail and that infamous white tail is smoke a little ways behind it, minutes after the first jet I saw another jet with the same features as the first one heading in the exact same direction of the UFO, as if the jet was going after the unidentified object, I video tapped th! e sy right after the UFO was spotted, I was so shocked, I've never seen anything like that before today!!!;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

A black round object dropped from the bottom of the aircraft.  The object dropped about 300 feet from the plane and continued flying vertical ((Correction:  horizontally)) following the direction of the plane towards the airport.  As it was getting closer to our direction we noticed a bubble like clear sphere and the black round object in the middle.

I saw a circular object flash a bright blue light that lit up an area 100x brighter than any of the stars in the sky.   The object proceeded to move in quick diagonal directions quickly then flash again every 20-30 seconds or so.  I watched it move up down side to side at angles not made by any aircraft I know of.   There was no sound,  It would also come to a quick stand still then zip off again.  I have never seen anything like it.   Btw, I just had my vision checked a month ago and it's 20/20.

Red/Orange ball over Tampa FL seen by retired salesman;2018-01-19 07:49:00;2:23;Red/Orange ball over Tampa FL seen by retired salesman UFO Report:  I am in Hillborough County Florida.  My address is Tampa, but I am actually in Northdale about 8 miles North of Tampa. At 7:49 PM, I walked into my office on the 3rd floor of my apartment building to get my keys.  The light was off and I noticed something outside of my plate glass window. Looking due East, I saw a bright red/orange light coming towards me from the horizon.  I got my cell phone out and videotaped it for the next 2 minutes and 20 seconds.  The fiery look settled down and I noticed it was a round orange globe, too big to be a planet, and too small to be the moon.   The skies were crystal clear.  It flashed orange lights a few times and then stayed white and seemed to be further away.  It drifted slowly to the south and stayed fixed for a minute or so.  Then it began drifting to the south more noticeably and stopped again.  After another minute or so, it simply disappeared.   I have an excellent quality video on my phone that shows this event really well. I am a retired salesman, 58 years old.  I moved to Florida from Kentucky 2 ½ years ago.  I am always sky watching.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

I looked up into the clear blue sky admiring the nice day at approximately 4:15 pm and saw approximately 5 round/orb shaped flying objects hovering in one spot high in the sky.  They weren't a distinct color--more grey/white/glass looking.   I would not have believed my eyes, and attributed it to dirty sunglasses, but then my husband who was looking around as well looked up and entirely unprovoked said, Do you see that?  It was then I knew we were observing something unusual.   Moments later, they disappeared.  I scanned the horizon left and right to see where they went, but there was no trace.   I have a Master's degree, and my husband is also college educated.  We work in professional, corporate America jobs.   This was highly unusual and I felt warrants a report.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
