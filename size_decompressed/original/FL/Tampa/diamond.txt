UFO IN TAMPA ASSENDED INTO NIGHT SKY 6-17-01;2001-06-17 22:16:00;1MIN OR LESS;UFO IN TAMPA ASSENDED INTO NIGHT SKY 6-17-01 MY SISTER AND I WERE DRIVING SOUTHBOUND ON HWY 597. AS WE WENT THROUGH A TOLL BOTH WE STARTED TO SEE AN OBJECT SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT OF THE CAR. AT FIRST WE THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OF THOSE LIGHT POSTS THAT SITS ON A 100 FT POST OVER THE HWY. AS WE GOT CLOSER TO THE OBJECT IT STARTED TO ASSEND AT A 90 DEGREE ANGLE. IT THEN DISSAPEARED INTO A SMALL CLOUD. IT WAS ALMOST DIAMOND SHAPED IT DIDN'T HAVE A TIP THOUGH. IT HAD A LARGE BRIGHT, WHITE, LIGHT FACING AND ILLUMINATING THE NIGHT SKY AS IT ASSENDED. IT ALSO HAD SEVERAL SMALL LIGHTS AROUND THE BASE APROX. 6-8.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
Pulsating Diamond Shaped object ejects two orbs of light towards the ground.;2002-12-10 05:30:00;20 minutes;Pulsating Diamond Shaped object ejects two orbs of light towards the ground. Driving South Bound on Dale Mabry Highway at 5:30 in the morning on my commute, I observed a diamond shaped object that seemd to have a distinct prismatic structure with pointed ends and was brightly illuminated. The structural detail, is what made it stand out from the garden variety landing lights of jets approaching the airport. If I recall,Tampas'airport does not begin flight operations until 6 or 6:30, realizing this, I realized I'm looking at something unusual. The object was the size quarter dollar held at arms length. I had ample opportunity to observe details as I was frequently stopping at intersections with my window rolled down staring at it (with my jaw hanging down). Object appeared to be about 5-7 miles to the left of my vehicle which would place it in a location to my east, between US Highway 41 and the campus of the University of South Florida. It seemed to be slowly drifting lateral to me. If it was as far east as Interstate 75, and the size it was to my naked eye,then this thing would have been really huge. If i had to estimate altitude, it appeared to be about 400-500 feet, but this is only a best guess. Object remained stationary, perhaps slowly drifting at times, and the intensity of its illumination changed every few seconds, i.e., dimmed and increased, in almost a blinking pattern.  2 (two) smaller orange-yellow orbs of light were ejected from the side of diamond shaped object and disappeared in a rapide downward motion. There may be possibility that this was a commerical blimp that may have been used in a recent Tampa Bay Buccaneers Football Game this month, but after it ejected the orbs of light, I quickly discounted that notion. I even considered a shuttle launch from Cape Canaveral, but I've observed many shuttle launches at night from our Gulf coast location and there was an absence of a large smoke plume illuminated by the engine nozzles and any distinct arc of movement. At the risk of diminishing any credibility this report may have,I prefer not to leave any contact infor! mation a t this time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

The pinkish orange lights dimmed out as the diamond shaped object moved overhead toward the east.;2012-10-18 23:40:00;3 minutes;The pinkish orange lights dimmed out as the diamond shaped object moved overhead toward the east. I walked out of the house toward the west and I saw a pinkish orange light flickering (like an arc welder does when welding) across the width of the front of the object coming toward me.  It was bright at first and dimmed to a dull red as the object approached , then it dimmed out as the diamond shaped object moved slowly overhead.  It appeared to be a light grey or dull white with no lights at all about 40 percent of the size of a full moon.  It continued to fly slowly and silently directly overhead toward the east-slightly southeast direction at a constant slow speed until it disappeared into the tree line.  There were no clouds, no wind ,it was an absolutely clear sky.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
LOW FLYING UFO STOPPED IN MID AIR OVER TAMPA, FL.  THEN VANISHED!;2012-12-31 23:32:00;4 minutes;ON 12/31/2012 AT 23:32 LOW FLYING UFO STOPPED IN MID AIR OVER TAMPA,FL.  THEN VANISHED! ON NEW YEARS EVE I WALK INTO MY BACK YARD AT 23:32,  AS IT SOUNDED LIKE A WAR ZONE. I SAW FIRE WORKS IN THE NIGHT SKY. THE SHY WAS PARTLY CLOUDY TOWARDS THE SOUTH SKY AND CLEAR TOWARDS THE NORTH SKY. TOWARDS THE SOUTH SKY I NOTICE A RED LIGHT TRAVELING FROM SOUTH TO NORTH ACROSS THE SKY. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A FIRE WORK GETTING READY TO EXPLODE, AS ALL THE OTHERS DID. HOWEVER, AS I KEPT MY SIGHT ON THE RED LIGHT, IT DID NOT EXPLODE. INSTEAD THE LIGHT TRAVELED SLOWLY ACROSS THE NIGHT SKY. AS IT FLEW CLOSER I SAW A CRAFT WITH THREE RED LIGHTS THAT WERE NOT FLASHING. AS IT TRAVELED JUST BELOW CLOUD LEVEL, THE LIGHTS LITE UP THE CLOUD ABOVE IT WITH A RED GLOW. I RAN IN THE OFFICE TO GRAB MY BINOCULARS (8X42). WITHIN 30 SECONDS I RETURNED TO MY BACK YARD, THE CRAFT WAS STILL FLYING SLOWLY ACROSS THE SKY AND WAS STILL UNDER THE CLOUD. SO I STARTED VEIWING IT WITH MY BINOCULARS AND CLEARLY SAW THREE RED LIGHTS, ONE ON THE TOP CENTER, AND ONE ON FRONT AND B! ACK. THE CRAFT APPEARED TO HAVE A GRAY METAL COLOR. ONCE IT WAS NO LONGER UNDER THE CLOUD THE SKY BACKGROUND WAS A CLEAR STAR LITE SKY. THE CRAFT LOOKED TO BE ABOUT 1000 FEET UP IN THE AIR AS IT TRAVELED NORTH A SHORT DISTANCE THEN CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP. THERE WAS NOT ANY NOISE COMING FROM THE CRAFT. IT STOPPED IN MID AIR FOR ABOUT 20 SECONDS. THEN THE CRAFT TOOK OFF FLYING FROM A DEAD STOP, TO A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED AT ABOUT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE TOWARD THE NORTHWEST SKY DIRECTION. THE CRAFT TRAVELED SO FAST THAT IT'S RED LIGHTS VANISHED INTO THE STAR LITE SKY IN UNDER 10 SECONDS.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

The lights were moving SSE at a high rate of speed.  There was no noise associated with this sighting.  The lights were not flashing and seemed to be at a high altitude.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
Orange diamond formation;2021-08-10 21:40:00;5 mins;Orange diamond formation I was driving home on busch blvd in tampa fl around 9:40 pm . I notice some bright orange lights in the sky and as I drove I noticed there was a diamond formation holding in the sky.  There were no tall building in that area. It help shape for a few minutes and as I tried to take a picture some of them faded away.  The orb at the bottom then moved up at the same angle of the one to the middle left light the glowing changed and then they faded away. I am sure other folks must of seen it as i was driving in the same direction. I only managed to get one clear picture of two of the orbs. I one bad photo I was near busch blvd and Armenia.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
