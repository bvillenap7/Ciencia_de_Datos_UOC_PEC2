Tampa, Fl.  7/5/79, Saucer shape object lit from underneath moving west toward the international airport or Tampa bay.;1979-07-05 02:30:00;20 minutes;Tampa, Fl.  7/5/79, Saucer shape object lit from underneath moving west toward the international airport or Tampa bay. I drove to Tampa from Lakeland after leaving a party.  I do not drink and was the designated driver.  After dropping off my friends, at about 2:30 AM,  I drove into my driveway and stepped out of my car.  I closed the car door and then fumbled on my key ring for the key to my house. I moved away from the car using what I thought to be moonlight to find my key.  When I looked up to my left,  over my pool area there was a large saucer shaped object suspended over my house, my pool, and also sections of my neighbors house.  I could not tell how high up it was nor how large since I had no reference about the object to compare.  The moonlight glow was coming from the bottom of the object where several lights appeared around the bottom outline of the object.  The lights were not round, but, rectangular with a space between each.  The lights began to rotate counterclockwise then a round center area lit up as well.  The center was a softer glow than the outer edge.  The object moved west over my house very slowly and with absolutely no sound.  I ran to the front of the house to continue to view it, but, it moved straight upward and the lights were shut off.  I was left in darkness.

UFO Saucer was seen hovering beyond trees as we were driving towards home and then disappeared.;1992-03-15 15:30:00;10 minutes;UFO Saucer was seen hovering beyond trees as we were driving towards home and then disappeared. I was riding with my Grandmother from high school one bright spring day and we were going down the street where my house is located on.  We were one block from my house when the radio started messing up.  Now, my Grandmother had only AM Radio, but the reception was never this bad.  Then, my Grandmother noticed something very odd in the sky beyond the trees.  She alerted my attention to it and I was shocked when I saw it.  It was the biggest thing I had ever seen.  It was in the typical UFO shape, but this one had like a half-dome on the bottom of it.  I have included a link to the image of it HERE.  We didn't think anything of it and she finished taking me home.  Well, she soon forgot about it, but I didn't and I kept reminding her of the encounter.  She didn't want me to keep mentioning it until, a few days later, she called me over to her house and she showed me a newspaper article where some people reported a sighting in Lake City, Florida only a few days after we saw that UFO in TAMPA, FLORIDA!

Disc shaped craft in downtwon Tampa, FL in 1996;1996-06-19 10:00:00;4 minutes;Disc shaped craft in downtwon Tampa, FL in 1996 I was on vacation [6/19/96] in Tampa on one of the long bridges heading east to Tampa, FL and I saw a metallic disc shaped craft slowly moving through the buildings downtown. I had watched it for a minute, not thinking much about it as I was listening to my walkman in the family van. I could look away, and it would still be there, and still slowly moving. It was very close the buildings and looked very odd and somewhat dangerous. I would cirlcle around the buildings not changing much in elevation, just 3/4 of the way up and sometimes higher. I found out much later there is an airport nearby, but it doesn't explain a disc shaped craft moving 1-5 mph 20 ft from the buildings for 3-4 minutes. The craft would move behind one of the buildings and be only partially visible, but circle around another building and become visible again. As we got to the end of the highway, I was excited to get a closer look and find out what it was and why it was so close to the buildings. It started to move behind a building again and became totally hidden behind a building, and I never saw it again. No sound or exhaust trail. I looked out every window of the van and it was nowhere to be seen. The three other passengers did NOT see it so of course when I told them about it I was not believed and teased about it. Oh well. I believe there are other curious life forms out there exploring, but I myself don't believe 90% of UFO sightings, but I know I saw something. It was in a very populated area, and I can't find any other reports of this, and if it were a UFO, I'm sure I would have heard about it. But I don't know it's been 6 years, and it DOES fascinate me and I just want an explaination!;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
High Altitude Silver Disc, Heading West. Over South Tampa, FL. 19:56 5/21/02  Want Radar Confirmation.;2002-05-21 19:56:00;@ two minute;High Altitude Silver Disc, Heading West. Over South Tampa, FL. 19:56 5/21/02  Want Radar Confirmation. I was inside about an hour before sunset, and my girlfriend yelled at me to come outside quickly. We live at the top of the interbay peninsula within Tampa Bay, of which at the foot is MacDill AFB. We regularly see airliners on approach to TIA, and tankers on approach to MacDill. This object was straight above the peninsula, heading West. At first it looked like a silver Mylar balloon, but to be that big, it would have to been very close. A balloon nearby is buffeted by air currents. This was flying in a straight line, at a steady pace. It did not have contrails. It looked like a one-foot wide Mylar balloon at 1,000 feet cruising at 100 mph. We are good at spotting different airliners, tankers, and other aircraft night and day. In the day you can see the silver cylinder of a jet. This was a wide round silver object. I wish I could be more specific. It was only visible for a brief while, and at first was difficult to notice as my girlfriend was pointing it out. She saw it only because she was looking at the moon. If it was large, it was very high up, and moving fast, but not too fast to watch. As for backgrounds, she is an ((profession deleted--financial)) I am in graduate school at the University of ((deleted)) ((deleted--pertains to space exploration and astronautics)). I hope to get my Master's in this to become a space advocate, perhaps working with NASA in some kind of outreach program. Let me state that I have never seen anything like a UFO in my life. Not that I didn't want to, just never did. The interesting thing is, I was four minutes away from beginning my Internet chat with my class, ((deleted--pertains to astronomy and exobiology)). Yes, this class examines the nature of the Universe, the chemical, geologic, and biologic issues in searching for life. Also the means of communication, but we haven't gotten there yet. No, I did not share this sighting with the class. This was only the second meeting of the Summer session. Didn't want to throw the class into chatter. I only mention this because of the interesting synchronicity, just as I was entering the class. What I want to know is there anyone with access to radar tracking data that can pinpoint this thing? 19:56, over south Tampa, heading West, 5/21/02. Thanks!

Driving down Bayshore Blvd. Me and my 5 friends thought what we thought was a blimp, still it lit up and you could clearly see the oval shape. Started spinning and flashing really fast. Then as I took my eyes off of it to watch the road, the lights went out, except for one red light at the top. And after a few seconds that went out too, and the ship completly disappeared.

5 discs along I-75;2007-12-16 18:30:00;5 mins;5 discs along I-75 While driving from Tampa to Leesburg along interstate 75, somewhere in pasco county, my cousin and I witnessed 5 saucer like discs scattered along a section of the highway. None more than 75ft from the ground. One was directly in the road and we drove right under it and it didn't move nor did anything happen with us or the truck. 2nd craft was to our right in an open field just hovering the same as the first. A 3rd craft was on the oncoming traffic side of the highway moving away slowly while a 4th was coming towards us but on the opposite side of the highway.. the 5th craft could barely be seen between the trees on the opposite side of the road. All crafts were displaying thousands of multi-colored lights on their underside, flashing at different speeds and no pattern. They seemed to be searching for something... We witnessed them from about 3miles away until we drive under and kept going. I couldn't stop, as my cousin wouldn't let me  behind us was another car and a semi truck a little further behind. The sighting was in an area where there was no houses or infrastructure only cleared land Manuel for cattle. So I don't know what the town was, but I'm sure we were going through pasco county.

Saucer Shaped UFO sighted in night sky;2011-02-17 21:00:00;5-10 seconds;Saucer Shaped UFO sighted in night sky I was outside my home, just taking in the fresh night air and saw a bright object high in the night sky.   At first, I thought it was an airplane, however, as it descended and finally came into view, I finally realized it was, in fact, a saucer-shaped UFO, metallic in nature and dark blue to silver in some areas.   The craft was large, a house-size vehicle, and had a half-spherical shape located/connected on its bottom.  The sighting ended when I had to enter the house to take care of my child.  I did not see it again that evening or since.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

3 flat, black, disc shapes w/lights descending rapidly over interstate in FL, looked like a flares or rockets.;2013-09-07 01:15:00;5 minutes;3 flat, black, disc shapes w/lights descending rapidly over interstate in FL, looked like a flares or rockets. Tonight while driving Eastbound on I-275 from Clearwater to Tampa, myself, fiancé & daughter were in vehicle and I noticed a flashing white & red light descending rapidly in the sky.  First thought it was an airplane or a Chinese lantern, but when it started getting lower thought it was possibly a life flight helicopter.  It descended straight down rapidly at a 45 degree angle, almost like a flare from a flare gun.  It stopped blinking and began pulsating - we tried to slow the vehicle down to take photos but couldn't get a clear shot. There is a large blue water tower on the left side of the highway - between the Ybor City exit and the I-4 interchange - and when we began driving past it I started screaming what is it. It was a flat black and round (as if you'd lay a car tire on its side) with one large round blinking white light on the left, and two large round red lights in the right side. It was near the same size AS the water tower so I was surprised nobody else could see it, it was VERY large.  My daughter began crying and we couldn't find an exit to turn around to look for it.  The craft came straight down, and literally STOPPED beside the water tower, it was hovering beside it.  That's when I started panicking because if it was an airplane, it was close enough to crash into the tower.  It was not a small engine plane as it had NO wings at all. Just a large black round & disc shaped with the 3 lights.  It made absolutely no noise, and when we started passing it, it very rapidly rotated out of sight to the right side, back behind the water tower. About a half hour later, we drove to the roof of the parking garage (5th floor) at the Hard Rock Casino in Tampa to see if maybe we could be high enough to see it or take a picture, but only had cell phones and the video was poor quality.  My fiancé stood on the hood of my car and I was just outside the car, and there were two more of the identical craft, approximately 1000 feet away - but these ones were ascending straight up.  Not at an angle at all, not very fast.  The same 1 white light and 2 red ones on each. I have never seen anything like this before in my life, I'm still really shaken at how close they were.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

The object was seen at noon time in the sky.  It was a very shiny silver in color.   It looked to be 1/2 the circumference of the sun.  The object was moving north as we were traveling on W. Bush Blvd.   The object was with the horizon of the clouds flying low yet most of the craft was in the clouds as it traveled.   I only saw one side of the object which was flat, disc shape and a dolphin like nose. It was traveling at a high speed and stayed within the clouds.  I only saw it for maybe 15 seconds then it was gone into the clouds.  This object was so shiny and silver like it had just been polished.   My grandson also saw it and he was the first to notice.   I e-mailed the Tampa Tribune requesting an answer if any person had reported the sighting.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

The ufo looked like a flying saucer with cloaking to make it look almost invisible but not quite.;2019-09-29 20:00:00;3 minutes;The ufo looked like a flying saucer with cloaking to make it look almost invisible but not quite. Me and 2 other friends were walking home from the neighborhood pool. We were looking at the stars because one of the stars was really bright and looked kind of orange so we thought it was mars.  While looking at that star we noticed another bright light that looked the same but it was moving slowly like a plane. Then we noticed what we first thought was a giant bird.  It was gliding closer to us in a perfectly straight path. It was about three storys above us from what we could guess. As it approached it almost looked like a giant ufo dish shaped cloud. We would have thought it was a cloud if it wasn't perfectly disk shaped and gliding slowly over us but much faster than the clouds.  It looked like what you think of when you think traditional ufo dish. The only difference was that it was that shape but it seemed like it was cloaked to try to hide. We never would have saw it if we weren't looking at the sky because it was so faint.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

While on our way we happened to snap a shot of the skyline while driving (and without looking up) and proceeded to head towards the beach to view the bright orange moon. However, It wasn’t until we got back home before finding out that there was something else in the air in the photo/video. The good thing about the picture is that it was snapped on the IPhone live shot so it’s actually a short video. •From the looks of the picture/video: the object is disc shaped with a small red orb leading it•  We did not witness this with our own two eyes, we only happen to snap the shot and seen it on our photo.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
