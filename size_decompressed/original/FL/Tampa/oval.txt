2 Orange Luminous Oval shape objects side by side zig zagging at the same time as they moved forward very fast.;1970-05-18 02:00:00;3 seconds;2 Orange Luminous Oval shape objects side by side zig zagging at the same time as they moved forward very fast. Before I had the sighting, I had a premonition that I was going to see something that night, and that I should be very alert for it. I was preparing to observe the heavens, as an amateur astronomer. As I was observing mars in my back yard with a small telescope, looking due south east at it through my telescope I got a premonition to look up, and as I did I saw 2 Luminous Orange Disks Oval shape traveling from the direction of Mars. They were traveling side by side as if they had a tractor beam holding them together. They zig zagged from side to side as they moved forward across the sky, very high up, from one horizon to the other in about 3 seconds. The sky that night was crystal clear, no moon glare.

Two unidentified crafts noted over the Gulf of Mexico.;2003-10-07 05:45:00;4 minutes;Two unidentified crafts noted over the Gulf of Mexico. Two crafts, identical in shape and size. Neither craft were emitting any lights. Their color was dull metallic grey with a dark tint, the sun was reflective off their hulls. The size of the crafts was somewhat smaller than a USAF/USMC C130 transport aircraft.  Location: Gulf of Mexico 20 nautical miles west of the Egmont Key entrance to Tampa Bay.  We (two adults) were sailing back to Tampa from a deep Gulf run. From a distance of 2 miles we noted a tanker heading east towards Tampa Bay. The seas were calm and the sky only slightly cloudy. Directly behind or astern of the tanker were the two crafts. They were an estimated 500 yards behind and an estimated 1,000 feet above the tanker. The crafts, flying somewhat in formation, one slightly ahead of the other, decended until they were no more than 200 feet above the water, and as they decended they altered course, moving in our direction. I changed course so as to prevent the sails from blocking our view of them and as I did so the crafts begin to gain altitude and move off in a westernly direction. Their speed was an estimated 150 knots while in the area and continually increasing while leaving the area.  I am very familiar with Military and civilian aircraft and could not identify either craft.Neither craft, seen very clearly through binoculars, displayed any semblence of a wing assembly, a tail section or visible engines. Neither craft displayed navigation lights, tail identification numbers, wings or a tail assembly they were oval in shape with the 'forward' section somewhat smaller in height to the 'tail'.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
2 crafts seen gliding over city;2007-04-29 11:30:00;2-3 minutes;2 crafts seen gliding over city My Fiancee'(32yo Manager) and I(25yo business owner) were waiting in line to pay for parking entry to an amusement park when I saw the crafts.  My Fiancee' was digging through his wallet for his pass, and I was looking to the south, up at the sky.  The sky was bright blue and the only clouds to be seen were two thin, wispy clouds at a very high elevation.  It was a very bright and sunny day. As I looked at the sky, I noticed a flying craft appear directly in front of where I was viewing.  I had not noticed the craft at all in my peripheral vision. The craft seemed to be flying at about the elevation I see helicopters flying at frequently.  Maybe a little higher.  The craft had the look like it was surrounded by a haze, and it appeared to be a solid dark grey color.  It also looked like it was flat on the bottom and hill shaped on top.  I did not see any wings or propellers on the craft.  It was flying in an easterly direction, and it appeared to be going pretty slow. Slower than I've ever seen an airplane fly.   It appeared to be gliding along.  I didn't really think much about the craft, figuring it was probably a helicopter or something, until it disappeared right in front of me.  I observed the craft for probably a couple of seconds, and then it appeared to fade and disappear completely.  It did not reappear.  I was going to say something to my fiancee', but, he was busy with the cashier, and I really didn't believe my own eyes enough to tell my fiancee' that I thought I saw a ufo.  I stared at the spot where I had seen it, hoping it would reappear, when ANOTHER craft materialized where the last one had.  This one was a little higher in elevation (not much) than the previous one.  It looked identical to the previous craft and was moving at the same speed.  This time I wanted to tell my fiancee so that I could have another witness, but he was still talking to the cashier.  It glided by for a couple of seconds and then proceeded to fade and disappear at about the same spot as the previo! us craft I think from the time I saw the crafts to the time they disappeared they might have traveled 1/4 mile.  They were moving very very slow.  There wasn't anything blocking my sight anywhere around me.  I had a clear view all around me of the sky.  I continued to watch for another couple of minutes to see if they did infact reappear somewhere else, but, I did not see the crafts anytime again after that.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
Silver metallic oval-shaped object seen over I-4 in Tampa, Florida on 09/27/2008 in daylight;2008-09-27 11:30:00;1-2 minutes;Silver metallic oval-shaped object seen over I-4 in Tampa, Florida on 09/27/2008 in daylight On this day of September 27th, 2008,  at approximately 11:30 a.m. located in Florida (around the Tampa area) I was driving westbound on I-4 towards the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. I was around exit 14 when suddenly a seemingly stationary silver, metallic, oval-shaped object caught my eye out of the left side of my peripheral view. I focused on it for what could have been no longer than about 10 to 15 seconds before it suddenly vanished before my very eyes. Before the object in the sky vanished, I started to ask my fiancé if she had seen it as well. Before I could finish, she immediately confirmed that she did also. After the first sighting of this object, my fiancé and I continued to search the sky in that general area. When about  no more that 20 seconds later, the object seemed to appear in the same direction as before, but it appeared smaller or further away. (I have no way of knowing the distance between the two sightings) This second occurrence seemed to last around 10 to 15 seconds and was again stationary, when it suddenly vanished while I was viewing it. I the fiancé, of the first reportee was sitting in the passenger seat when out of the left side I witnessed a silver, metallic, oval-shaped object for approximately 10-15 seconds. I saw the object move slightly towards the left and then more so towards the right very briefly, then I saw it vanish. After a few seconds of conversation with my fiancé (without eye contact because I was searching for the object in the sky…) I continued to look in that general area in the sky and witnessed the object for a second time after about 20 seconds or so. This time I saw the object of what seemed to be  a further distance, however this time I saw no movement before it vanished and only lasted about 10-15 seconds. Confirming… I too, saw these objects in the sky on September 27, 2008 at approximately 11:30 a.m. in Florida (near the Tampa area) heading westbound on I-4 driving towards the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

I saw what appeared at first to be a white light moving across the sky which swiftly changed direction. It moved in a boxy u shaped pattern and then disappeared behind some trees. This location is near the airport and I have seen many planes coming in and out of the area. This did not appear to be any standard plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

metallic silver object clearly seen hovering in the afternoon over tampa and after a minute of observing vanished without a trace.;2009-01-22 13:15:00;1 minute;metallic silver object clearly seen hovering in the afternoon over tampa and after a minute of observing vanished without a trace. Time: January 22, 2009, 1:15pm Conditions: clear skies,  sunshine,  and clouds far into the distance Location: New Tampa east of Bruce B downs several lights north of the I75 overpass. On the 22nd,  me and my boyfriend were heading to USF for my class that afternoon.  We were heading from our home down Cross Creek and traveling due south on Bruce B Downs blvd at about 45MPH.  It was a clear Florida afternoon with clouds only in the distant horizon.  Upon crossing the Tampa Palms region my boyfriend had spotted something in the sky and was laughing about how normally people who see UFO’s depict an object which seems very unlikely to be a UFO at all making the whole possibility even more far fetched.  I looked up and saw an object in the sky just beyond the power/telephone lines crossing the road, and once we had passed under these I could clearly see the object without interference. From the passengers seat of his SUV,  the object appeared to be close to a 45 degree angle from the horizon, and about 5 degrees to the left of our car’s heading which looked to be just to the left of the center of the windshield from what I could tell.  The shape was horizontally ovular with more of acute sides on the left and right forming near points.  The texture seemed to be quote slick as the light  reflection from the sun and shadow underneath were relatively free of distortion.  The color of the object to the naked eye seemed to be silver hues or possibly a very metallic white,  but either way the surface had very reflective properties.  The top was very bright white with sunlight,  but the bottom were tones of silver and grey with shadows that looked like slight reflections of the tree line below. Being an aspiring scientist I immediately thought about all the possibilities and scenarios in my head and concluded it must have been a weird shaped blimp for an advertisement at one of the local stores near Amberly dr.  I ruled out a plane instantly because it did not change size to indicate a northern or southern trajectory, and it did not waiver side to side in our view either.  For the clarity of the sky and close proximity to us,  I was able to rule out a helicopter instantly also.  The object made no sound,  had no impact on the tree line below, and no propellers or engines of any sort were visible. Me and my boyfriend stared at the object while slowing down in our drive and I made the comment,  “You know if this is what people seen when they reported UFO’s I can see how they make that assumption,   after seeing this blimp,  I would nearly claim it were a UFO if I had been startled or had bad eyesight myself.”   As we got a little closer I started thinking how weird it was that the blimp/balloon had no advertisements on it,  no personnel carriage underneath,  or no tie down to a building below.  We kept staring at the object as a full minute had passed with it in our sights and we still had no reasonable theories as to what it was. My boyfriend laughed and stated that it must be a UFO then,  and I agreed since it would be the simplest solution to the situation,  and right when I had said jokingly ,“Yay aliens,  how neat!”  the object vanished right before our eyes.  As bizarre as that sounds,  I know.  It reminded me of those home movies where a kid holds up a ball and says, “now it’s here………..now it’s not (and the camera recording breaks for a moment)”  then the ball is suddenly not in the kid’s hand due to 2 separate recordings being edited together.  It was a quick and abrupt vanishing act for this object.  Now neither of us were laughing. I continued watching, scanning, and searching the sky as we drove all the way to campus.  There were still no clouds around,  no chemical trails from an aircraft,  no noise of an engine accelerating rapidly enough to be gone that quickly.  Yet the object was nowhere to be found with no trace of where it went.  It was gone before I could blink right before my very eyes and for the first time in my life I had no clues to lead me to any sort of conclusion. We waited the last few days to see if any other reports surfaced in the news explaining what we saw,  but to no avail.  While I would love to have an alien encounter,  I’m not sure what it was we saw and am not entirely convinced It was a UFO,  I would like to put it out there for anyone who would like to find answers and put all these puzzle pieces together for us and the rest of the confused world.  Thank you;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
UFO spotted on TV right before the Superbowl;2009-02-01 17:50:00;4-5 seconds;UFO spotted on TV right before the Superbowl My family and I was watching the superbowl on TV, and between 5:45-6:00pm right after Faith Hill sang her song before the game even started they focused on the American flag blowing in the wind.  So as they start to zoom in if you look in between the flag and its pole you will see an object clear as day moving from the top of the screen to the bottom.  Keep in mind this area was marked as a no fly zone.   To me it did not look like any plane that I have seen and it moved Relatively fast.  What I am wondering is did anyone else see this?;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

Large bright white/blue orb or saucer hovering in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius??  PD));2016-02-11 19:40:00;15-30 minutes;Large bright white/blue orb or saucer hovering in the sky Driving down the crosstown in Tampa.  As I looked over to the right, I noticed a pretty large sized oval/saucer like object floating in the sky.  I was headed east on the crosstown going towards downtown Tampa and the object was floating to the north of my location.   I have to say, I almost ran off the road because I was staring at this object, trying to figure out what it really was.  It was a very bright white/light blue orb/saucer just hoovering over the suburbs.  I was able to take photos of the object and after reviewing them on my phone, it was pretty clear that whatever this object might have been could move or switch locations in literally a blink of an eye.   3 photos were taken within 1 second of each other, and after comparing them side by side you can clearly see just how quickly the object switched locations.  The crosstown provides and elevated view of the surrounding suburbs, so I had a great view of the object.   Someone else had to have seen this, ther! e is no way I would have been the only one.  If this object is something our government has created, then props to them because it is definitely beyond our time. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of Sirius.

Daytime bright white light with 'heat wave' aura around it, flutters near Tampa airport.;2016-04-06 15:30:00;10 seconds;Daytime bright white light with 'heat wave' aura around it, flutters near Tampa airport. After landing at Tampa International Airport, and while riding a shuttle bus to a car rental agency nearby, I observed what I first thought was a helicopter because of its slow speed and maneuvering, reflecting light from the sun.  As I continued to observe I saw that the object was round, very bright, and with a 'shimmering' aura around it.  It was about 1500 feet in the air and near the airport. It traveled in an 'up and down' pattern.  While watching it the object just disappeared, only to reappear again in the same spot.  It was a very bright white light, oval or round, with a 'heat wave' around it.  It then disappeared again and did not return.  I would estimate that the object was a mile away from my location.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
Oval shaped three light object.  ((anonymous report));2017-01-26 19:00:00;Ongoing;Oval shaped three light object. I was informed of this object floating in the general direction of Tampa from a family member.  Looking upward, I could see a bright white-ish ovular object, periodically two other small circular dark orange lights emerged at the top and bottom.  No motion, just floating there.  I checked google skymap and it said that it was likely Mars or Venus which, I highly doubt.  We have an air force base in this area, but I really don't think it has anything to do with it either.  I have checked again before submitting this report and can confirm the object is gone ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

As I'm approaching the I4 junction I witness about 15 warm hazy orange glowing orbs in the sky about 50 feet above and about five streets away from the interstate. Some orbs seemed closer to each other than others. They were all about the same height, and they were hovering. I got off the nearest exit and tried to keep my.eye on one. As I'm driving I also witness other people walking and pointing up at the sky. I feel relieved I'm not the only one finding these lights strange. I follow the light as it dims out and disappears, and when I can park, I see no signs of the other lights.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

Approximately 6 or 7 streets north of Gandy, I witnessed three bright yellow circles or spheres shoot overhead, in formation.  It caught my eyes as they moved like a fighter jet descending toward a landing strip in the distance.  At first I didnt think anything of it since MacDill airforce base is located a few miles south from Gandy, in the direction I was headed.  But the speed of these aircraft was much faster than when you see a plane flying overhead.  Because of the oak trees that line Bayshore Blvd, my view was blocked for the next few streets until I turned onto Gandy.  I really was interested to see the aircraft again, but there was nothing in the sky anywhere.  I doubt these were military aircraft but I thought important to report this sighting of something that I suspect was UFO.  I hope this is helpful.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
