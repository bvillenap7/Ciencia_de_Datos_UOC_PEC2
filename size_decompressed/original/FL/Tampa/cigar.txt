I was with watching a friend of mine go-karting at an amusement park that used to be located on Dale Mabry Avenue south of the former CSX railroad bridge. It was early evening, and as I watched him turn a lap I noticed what I first thought to be a KC-135 heading to the north over the typical Mac Dill AFB runway path. The object made a gentle wooshing sound, was approximately 300-500 feet in length, and moved slowly (est. 25-50 mph) at an altitude of approximately 1,000'. I pointed to the object hoping my friend would see it, but he was enjoying his go-kart ride and did'nt look. The metallic object literally seemed to vanish as it slowly continued northward. I am very familiar with aircraft, military, commercial, private, and balloons-- this was not any of them.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
Wierd cigar shape flying object  with strange aura and no sound.;2009-02-24 12:00:00;3 minutes;Wierd cigar shape flying object  with strange aura and no sound. On the 24th of Febuary, 2009 my brother ask me to take him to pay his celluar phone bill.  We pulled up at a small business plaza and i drop him off at the front of the place.  I continued on to park and found a space a few feet fron the cell phone payment store. As i was waiting for him i was looking around and looked up to my left and saw a white object flying in the sky, at frist i tought it was small business jet plane, but when i looked at the object i realized it did not have a tail or jet engines, i statrted my car and pulled out of my space to a spot where i could see the object better, and saw it was white with a strange glow and had a small set of wings 3/4 of the way to what looked like the end of it. What really startle me then is that it was flying real straight and then all of a sudden it sped up fast and vanished. It was a clear day with blue sky, and i know what a plane looks like, because, in this area i was located at you can see the planes after they take off or when the are begining to decend, because the airport is over 12 miles away. What caught my eye was the fact that this object was flying real low and fast and had no engines and no tail and made no sound, I was hopeing my brother would come out quicker to see what was happening, but by the time he did it was gone. I know some people are going to say it was a military drone or something like that, but i was in the military for almost 14 years and i know what airforce drones all look like. So what i saw was definetly a UFO,  I include some drawings I made of what i saw, let me tell you it realy freak me out, and at first not even my brother belived me, but when he saw i was serious he began to wonder if what i saw was real.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
Fighter jets circled the object;2009-11-06 08:15:00;10 min;Fighter jets circled the object I was driving on I275 south towards Saint Petersburg fl, About one mile from howard exit. While i was driving something caught my eye it looked like it might even be a bird, while driving i kept looking up at the object and realized this was no bird. It was really strange a metallic object that was just hovering. It seemed as if it had no flight pattern and would hover and move with no direction, its hard to explain almost like a ballon. It was so interesting, I tried my hardest to watch it and keep my eye on the road, if your familair with tampa traffic. As i got closer to the object it looked like a cigar like a 50 gallon drum floating in air,my best description. To be quite honest it was kind of scary, I was so close to calling the police, but wouldnt you know it two fighter jets came out of know where and started circleing the object, I got off 275 and headed towards clearwater and lost sight of the object. Im telling you something happened today, and pr! oably most people didnt see it because it was rush hour and they where paying attention to the road. I have always been skepitcal about alien bullshit, and goverment cover up but this was real people. There must have been other witness!;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
We noticed a bright silver, cigar-shaped UFO flying along the edge of a nearby storm cloud.;2017-06-23 09:23:00;~3 minutes;At 09:23, EDT, on Sunday, June 23rd, looking to the northwest out our front window, we saw a trailing edge of a thunderstorm moving from west to East over the city of Tampa, Fla.   Below that trailing edge, we noticed a bright silver, cigar-shaped UFO flying along the edge of the storm.  The UFO had no lights, no noise, no wings, and no apparent signs of propulsion.  It appeared to be approximately 2,500 to 3,000 feet above ground level, and although we could not determine its width because we could only see its port (left) side, the craft appeared to be about the length of two aircraft carriers.   The craft kept flying into and out of the storm clouds for about three minutes, then it came out of the clouds once more and flew off at a high rate of speed in a southwesterly direction, toward the Gulf of Mexico.   Due to the apparent distance and little time we could not get photos.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

On 7/21/18 20:59, I observed a very large red glowing cigar shaped light, or object, fly from south to north over Tampa, Florida.  It was quite eerie, as it was a very unusual and intense color of red for it to be a jet aircraft on a landing approach to either Tampa International Airport or nearby MacDill AFB illuminating a bunch of clouds with its landing lights.  I have seen many normal aircraft fly through the clouds but never a color or shape like this.   The object appeared as a red glowing cigar shape for about 7 seconds, and then instantly changed shape to a much smaller but very intense bright white circular shaped object or light as it continued to fly in a northerly direction for about another 30 seconds.  I could see that the object had changed to a pulsing reddish orange glow as it flew away.  I never observed any typical red or green aircraft navigation strobe lights.   I was able to get several pictures of it from my cell phone, but unfortunately, not quickly enough to capture an image in the bright red cigar shape portion of the sighting.   There was never any sound of aircraft engines and there were no NASA rocket launches that evening at Cape Kennedy.  The entire sighting was about 45 seconds.   I have worked for military aerospace contractors for 15 years and consider myself well read on aircraft.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
