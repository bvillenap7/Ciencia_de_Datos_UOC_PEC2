A cross shaped object, bright white in color, fell directly down from the sky at a rapid rate.   This was in the vicinity of Tampa International Airport, but was definitely not a plane.  We live due south of the airport and this figure was moving at a much greater speed than any plane I have ever seen and was fully lit, not point lights at various locations like a plane.   When it was within a couple hundred feet above ground level, it just disappeared.   I waited for a crash, but heard nothing.  The cross-like figure had both axes of equal length.  There was a curved structure connecting the lower leading vertical axis to the lateral axis.  We have lived at this house for seven years and see air traffic all the time.  I am a licensed architect who studied engineering and I have never seen anything of this nature.  The weather was partly cloudy with a temperature of 80 degrees Fahrenheit.  There was a large, nearly perfectly round cloud where the object began wi! th winds heading East at 3mph at the time of the event.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
