cylindrical shaped object with rotating display;1984-06-01 02:20:00;5 minutes;cylindrical shaped object with rotating display I was leaving work after 2AM when i saw in the sky a cylinder-shaped object with a circular blue digital display with what seemed to me to be possibly Cyrillic letters that sequentially moved from left to right, like one of those displays you see on bank buildings and such.  It made a high-pitched whining noise with two tones, maybe an octave or two apart. It seemed to me to be no more than maybe 50-100 feet overhead.  It moved rather slowly and quite majestically.   At the time I had assumed it was a weather monitor or some such.  There is an Air Force base in Tampa, so I supposed it was something to do with that, however, the unusual alphabetical characters makes me wonder what it actually was.  It seemed to be rather small, at most half the size of a Volkswagen bug.  I'm curious to know if anyone knows what it was.  Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

Comet like object with a crayon in the middle.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD));2007-12-10 21:00:00;15 minutes;Comet like object with a crayon in the middle. I was talking with a couple of friends out in my front yard and I noticed what appeared to be a comet. I pointed it out to the other four witnesses that I thought it was a comet. I went in to grab a pair of binoculars. Through the binoculars the center was shaped like a cylinder more like a crayon. Everyone agreed it looked like a comet but were not sure. It was a clear night out and there was not any planes in the area. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD));28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

Two tennis players witness two bright objects in the morning sky.;2015-05-29 10:00:00;1 hour;While Playing Tennis in South Tampa, Florida It's Friday May 29, 2015 around 10 am, and my tennis partner and I are playing singles at Cal Dickson Tennis Center in South Tampa.  We are the only ones there.   It's 3 to 3 in the second set, add out and I'm serving from North to South.  I'm serving a second serve.  My service toss is in an area directly above my head as I face West.  I tilt my head up as I look at the area in the sky where I want to toss the ball into.   I look up an toss the ball and stop.  Directly in the area that I'm tossing the ball I see a object every high in the sky reflecting the light from the sun.   I say to my partner look at that and point.  He can't see it.  So I go over to his side of the court next to him and point at the object in the sky.  It's stationary and metallic reflecting the light from the sun, which at 10am is south east.  He sees it and we stare transfixed.  He sees a second similar object higher in the sky that I can't see. The object stayed in this area for around 5 or more minutes and then either left or disappeared.  We just couldn't see it anymore. Cal Dickson Tennis Center is around six miles North of U.S. Central Command MacDill Air Force Base in South Tampa. My partner and I resumed playing tennis and shortly thereafter a military helicopter, (long and silver), appeared in the sky near where the object was that we sighted, but lower.  The helicopter stayed stationary in the sky till around 11am.  And numerous military aircraft with contrails appeared patrolling flying very high in the sky near where the object was sighted.  These aircraft were many times higher in the sky than the helicopter. My partner and I have been playing tennis at the Cal Dickson Tennis Center three times a week on weekday mornings for over two years and are familiar with the aircraft flying over the area.  Tampa International Airport is around five miles northwest of the Cal Dickson Tennis Center. Occasionally, traffic, news and police helicopters appear over the area of the Cal Dickson Tennis Center.  But these helicopters are always east, southeast, northwest over land.  The unidentified flying object we saw was West of us out over the bay.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
