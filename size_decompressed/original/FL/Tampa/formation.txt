We all stopped our cars and stared at this strange event.  At least 10 cars and 20 people.  I spoke to a few of them.  They all asked the other the same question, Did you guys see that?  What was it.   I took a few photos.  I only had my Sony 8MP camera with me.  You'll be amazed at what the pics look like.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

I was driving home from work early in the morning and I saw two bright lights in the sky about two hundred feet apart.  At first I thought that they might me starts but they seemed too low and too bright and they seemed to hover and move slightly. Out of the corner of my eye I saw what looked like a shooting star but when I looked at it, it was the same shape and size of the other too lights and it moved extremely fast, faster that any thing I have ever seen.  When it was gone I watched the other two lights closely until I made it home.  They seemed to glow now and then and turn orange. I kept thinking that they must be starts but I have never seen stars that did this.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
