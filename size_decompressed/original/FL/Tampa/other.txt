I was at a pee wee football game with my parents.  As we were watching the game, a cheerleader said, Look, what's that? My mother and I turned around to look and we saw a craft with lights blinking and going in a circle around the craft.  The craft was hovering about 5 miles away over Temple Terrace Florida.  To this day, I do not remember ever seeing anything like it since.  My mother also claims that she saw something.  However, she does not believe in UFOs. She states that she does not know what it was that was hovering on that night.  I have never reported this before. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

They were appeared to be trapezoidal in shape. The event lasted approximately 3 minutes. On the date and time listed above, my girlfriend and I were travelling from Clearwater, Florida to our home in Tampa. That would place us travelling almost due east.It was approximately 6:45 to 6:50 pm when I noticed these two objects at about 45 degrees above the horizon. The objects were appeared to be trapezoidal in shape...wider at the bottom than at the top.  I asked my girlfriend if she saw what i saw...and she replied that she did.  Since we were heading toward the causeway we had an unobstructed view of these objects.  They appeared to me to be silvery and I asked my girlfriend if they looked to be in a haze and she thought perhaps they were.  I looked up through the sunroof of the car and saw the moon as clear as could be....there was no haze in the sky.  We continued to watch the objects, which appeared to be side by side.  They then separated for a bit, moving very rapidly.  Then after about 3 minutes or so they darted towards the north and disappeared in the blink of an eye.  These objects seemed to be very large.  At first I wondered if they were military aircraft, as we were heading towards McDill AFB in Tampa.  I asked my girlfriend and she agreed with me that neither one of us had seen any aircraft like those and that they seemed to move too fast. I am a 39 year old male with a 20 year sales background.  My girlfriend is 34 and has a 15 year sales background.  We are both college educated.  Neither one had any alcohol prior to our siting.

Black line in sky running from horizon to top of sky.;2001-04-16 12:55:00;1 minute;Black line in sky running from horizon to top of sky. I was driving northbound on I-75 just south of exit 46 in Hilsbourough County, FL.  It was a mostly sunny day with a few clouds scattered throughout the sky.  At the listed time I looked out the left side through my driver's door window.  At this point I saw what apeared to be a deep blue or black line running from the horizon to somewhere in the sky above the my car.  This line was about the width of a full moon.  It appeared to run from the west horizon to the top of the sky, wich was out of my view.  I thought it was something on my glass so I moved forward and backward to see if it moved.  I then rolled my window down to confirm that it wasn't on my window.  I also noticed that this line was above the clouds that were in the sky. It looked like someone had taken an pencil eraser and erased the light blue part of the sky where the line was.  Where the line was looked dark, like I wasn't looking through the atmosphere, but straight into space.  The edges of this black line weren't crisp.  They faded to the light blue that was on both sides of the line. After about a minute the line slowly faded away and the sky turned to its normal color in that area.  I have never seen anything like this and have no idea what it was.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
What was thought to be a released childs balloon suddenly becomes extremely fast round black object that dissapears out of sight.;2003-06-04 08:35:00;10 - 20 seconds;What was thought to be a released childs balloon suddenly becomes extremely fast round black object that dissapears out of sight. I am a retired Special Operations NCO.  I retired April 22, 1995 with over forty five years of military service.  I would be only too happy to take any test ou desire to prove I am not fabricating.  At work where I field incoming calls all day, I sit directly in front of a wall of windows on the third floor of our office building, facing directly East.  I keep my binoculars on my desk because I like to watch birds and airplanes landing at Tampa International Airport which is just South of my location.  It was quiet and I had no calls when I observed a round black object that appeared to be a childs balloon that had gottern away and was floating in the air.  It was black but not dull, but also not shiney.  However, it seemed to reflect some light.  As I watched the object I relized it was not a balloon because it was moving Northward faster than the wind was blowing.  At the same time, I realized I was not able to establish a distance either from the object or the altitude of the object.  While maintaining what appeared to be exactly the same altitude, the object began to rapidly accelarate and in an instant dissapeard beyond my visions ability to maintain contact.  It never appeard to change altitude or color.  In my many years of military service I have witnessed planes, rockets and many other airborn objects but never, have I observed an object travel at such a high rate of speed so quickly and effortlessly.  I haver no way of knowing how far it was from me but I could see it clearly till it went out of sight.  I wold be most happy to submit myself for any and all testing you may desire.  I did report the event to the Miitary. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corresponded with this witness, and we deem him to be exceptionally credible.  PD));28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

White Boomerang causes chemtrail laying jet to veer off course.;2006-11-22 18:00:00;1.5 minutes;White Boomerang causes chemtrail laying jet to veer off course. Heavy chemtrail laying day.  Noticing one of the jets swerving off course that was very odd.  Then I saw the a white boomerange moving right where the jet veered off course.   Unlike the jets, the boomerang had not contrail and was the same size as the jet at the same altitude.  It moved northeastward and then vanished.   It's as if the chemtrailing planes temporarily made the craft visible.   Twenty Five minutes later helicopters circled the area once the sun had set.

It was about 400 or 500 feet from us.   There were no airplanes, helicopters, or other crafts seen in the area, at that time.  We were stuck in the line at a drive through restaurant so we were not able to follow it, to see where it was landing.   The weather was over cast, and shortly after the sighting, it began to rain.

Metallic Pyramid like object seen over Tampa Florida Downtown in daylight.;2015-03-18 16:30:00;5 minutes;Metalic Pyramid like object seen over Tampa Florida Downtown in daylight. I'm a 31 year old female.  I Spotted a highly reflective, metallic pyramid like object hovering around the Hotel Floridan in day light at Tampa Downtown.  Appeared to be 5x5 feet in height and width.   The object rotated slowly showing it's flat metallic surfaces, reflecting the sun on its panels.  I watched it slowly move down from the sky in the distance towards the building 15 floors up from my apartment.   At first I thought it was a helicopter but as it got closer, I noticed it looked nothing like it.  I then tried to see if it was a balloon.  But when I saw it move in a zig zag movement going up, down, left and right, I scratched that idea too.  I watched it move up and down along the building and then quickly move off into the horizon, changing its speed as it eventually zipped upwards into the sky.  I'm hoping other's saw this object too. Very strange. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Odd football shaped object seen from Dale Mabry Highway in Tampa, traveling near airliner.;2015-05-06 14:30:00;few seconds;Odd football shaped object seen from Dale Mabry Highway in Tampa, traveling near airliner. At approximately 2:30, in the afternoon on 05/06/15, I was heading south on Dale Mabry Highway near the Northdale Drive area.  The sky was overcast in patchy sections where there were areas of clear sky between the clouds.  Cloud ceiling looked to be around 6-7000 feet.   I glanced up at an airliner that was making an approach to Tampa Int'l Airport, traveling on a SSW heading.  I estimate the aircraft's altitude at about 3,500-4000 feet.  As I watched the airliner, I spotted another object drop out of the clouds above and slightly in front of the airliner.  The object was shaped like a football with the ends more narrowly pinched together.  It was uniformly gray in color.   It described a smooth arc downward for maybe 500' or so, then pulled up and into the next cloud bank.  The sighting lasted only a few seconds, but the object was clearly visible, and I could see the airplane and the object together.  I would estimate the object to be slightly smaller than the airliner so perhaps 100' long.  It had no wings, engines or other visible characteristics or marking.   Its movement was very smooth and fluid.  I'm not sure if anyone on the aircraft was in a position to see the object as it was almost directly above them and perhaps 1000-2000 feet higher.   When the object ducked back into the clouds, I continued driving south in hopes I might see it again but it did not reappear.  Not sure what it was but very unusual looking and appeared to be controlled.  It was moving slightly faster than the aircraft so maybe around 200-250 knots.   I am something of an aviation buff but this did not resemble any aircraft that I know of.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

Video starts as soon as we both start to look at it about 5 seconds after 1st seeing it. It then starts to come overhead only to be a mile away in the same instance. instant acceleration!

outside with my mom, flat row of lights that seemed to dance and disappear showing up a mile away or right over our head in same second;2019-10-01 00:30:00;5-7 minutes;outside with my mom, flat row of lights that seemed to dance and disappear showing up a mile away or right over our head in same second Me and my mother went out on our back porch for a cigarette. While she was talking to me I could see about 7 lights in a line slowly moving into view. these lights never deviated or changed position making it seem to be 1 craft. My mom could see my face as I thought in my head If that thing starts moving, I am OUTTA HERE sure enough as my mom turns around slowly in horror it now starts heading our way. recorded a video and dialogue between my mom and I as well as the craft is captured. craft was a compilation of 7 small lights bundled closely together. craft almost 'waited' for my mom to turn around as well before it started its dance. it would quickly maneuver 3 different directions impossibly before going completely invisible and showing up miles or a mile from last seen area. it did this maybe 5 or 6 times IN 5 or 6 seconds. Moved so quickly even my mother kept saying Why?? lights were pink on outside edges with violet or purple for the inside! 5 lights. its movements defied conventional physics, Newtonian forces would have destroyed anything else attempting that. As scared as i was, i did not want my mom to run inside without me. I explained to my mother that this craft is the united states navy x-37 - using mass reduction drive together with piezoelectric superconducting material (ultrasonic vibrations causing noble gas to ionize) she understandably didn't know what the hell i was talking about. I explained 'Ok, its meant to refill combat planes on the field, needing those movements and maneuvers not just to get around but to evade incoming fire . craft was with us for around 5 minutes now appearing overhead and a mile away in the same second. finally in the video (video shows craft as 1 blurry purple ball) I say 'Oh i think i can hear it, sounds exactly like an airplane' because craft was completely silent the entire time, as i said that i could see a regular commercial airline start to come around from the to! ps of houses. As soon as that happened, this craft became ...e! mbarrass ed? it stopped moving crazy and put itself on a straight trajectory, accelerating instantly but not going too insanely fast it b-lined until it went below horizon. my mother wouldn't go to sleep unless she found something similar online. which she did amazingly, and only based on the movements it was doing in the video were exactly the same speed and velocity as we saw. by 4 am my mother finally went to sleep content with what she saw online and in person that night. still confused, but happy someone else had filmed it.

I stood up but only that once did it seem to bounce and leave a trail);28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

I am an Architect in the local area and I have a good eye for detail. My wife and I were sitting out on our back porch talking to her father on speaker phone while we both were looking towards the South. There was a nice crescent moon and a very clear sky with many stars. We then saw 6 semi translucent lit objects that each almost appeared like triangles. They seem to be in a semi camouflage state. No sound and the rate of speed was faster then a conventional jet but slower then a meteor. They were traveling in formation in a staggered v formation. Traveling from the North to South towards Mac Dill Air Force base. One note is the Mac Dill is currently doing Navy jet training in the area which started yesterday. Not sure if that is related or not. Very interesting siting.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
