Zig Zagging Star Over Tampa Florida;1975-12-25 23:00:00;5 minutes;Zig Zagging Star Over Tampa Florida Mc Donalds Christmas nightime party.  Upper deck 1975.  Witness was an Airforce personnel who worked part time named Luis I believe.   We saw a triangular bright looking star and watched it go straight, zig zag, zooming up and down.  I asked him is that a new air craft on Mc Dill AFB?  He said no!  A plane or craft we have cannot move like that.  No one was on the rooftop but us at that time so he told me never to tell because people would think we were nuts.  He had his career to think about.   I will never forget it.  I was about 16 or so I believe.  I am now getting up in age so I want it known and wonder if any other people living in Tampa saw this?  We could not have been the only ones. It looked like a star it was so bright and high in the sky.  He said this thing must be larger than what we were seeing!  Just need someone to know this information in case anything ever happens to me. ((NUFORC Note:  Date above is approximate.  PD));28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
ET Stops for Big Gulp?;1997-04-18 23:59:00;5 minutes;ET Stops for Big Gulp? Driving Home from Tampa,traveling north on hwy 41,my wife and I saw what looked like A perfect triangle hovering over a convienance store. Craft appeared about 45 feet on the sides with 4 lights all white,3 in a line and one in the middle of one edge and somewhat dimmer. no markings were observed.The skin looked like it had a textured surface.The strangest thing was it didnt really didnt Light the ground up an more than the streetlights at the intersection. Craft was about 40 feet off the ground.Silent The light went red right next to it,so I stopped. Craft may have been moving very slowly,like walking speed,because as soon as I stopped it floated over my vehicle and passed us going southwest about 2-3 mph. I actually could have gotten out ,picked up a rock and hit it easily. on the ride back to hernando we passed 2 others of the same look,they were traveling south parallel to hwy us 41,about 1/4 mile from roadway. I posted this Before and My email was released somehow resulting in a government spook sending me some disturbing correspondance.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
Flying V seen by multiple wintesses in during meteor shower.;1998-11-17 04:30:00;1 minute;Flying V seen by multiple wintesses in during meteor shower. We were all sitting outside watching the meteor shower. As we looked up to see the meteor flash by, a flying V flew under the meteors vapor trail. If we hadn't been looking up in that direction we would have never seen it. It was almost like it was translucent with dark brown overtones. This craft looked just like a boomerang except it was about 500ft wide. It made no sound and had no lights. It was very erie to say the least. The object appeared to be pretty high in the air moving at a higher than average speed( in comparison to an airplane).;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
large ufo -triangle shaped-three lights   ((NUFORC Note:  Titan 4 launch from Cape Canaveral.  PD));2003-09-09 00:30:00;3 to 5 min.;((NUFORC Note:  A launch of a Titan 4 rocket from Cape Canaveral  was conducted at 00:29 hrs. on this date.  We suspect that the launch was the cause of the several reports NUFORC received from multiple points in Florida.  We post the reports to illustrate how easy it is to misidentify a relatively commonplace event.  Even we were intrigued by the reports, when they first were submitted, and it took us approximately 12 hours to identify the apparent source of the reports.  PD)) large ufo -triangle shaped-three lights September 9, 2003:  I was headed home from a friends house tonight in Tampa, Florida on 275 south heading in the eastern direction towards Brandon at 12:30 am eastern time, when a strange light in the sky caught my eye.  I took a second glance and noticed that it looked like nothing I have ever seen before in my life.  That’s when I got concerned and started to pay close attention to it’s details. It started off as a huge ball of light (almost blinding bright) with a rectangular shaped trial tapering off of it which fluctuated in length. It looked as if it had just taken off from somewhere to the west and was headed towards my direction and grew in size. Then this ball of light morphed into three separate lights forming the shape of a triangle which continued to flicker. All three of these lights had distinct coloration’s to them the main most radiant light at the front/top of the triangle was a pale yellow color, the light on the left was a pale red color, and the light to the right  was a greenish blue color.  The shape of the lights were in the form of an acute triangle and just floated with such grace. I turned off my radio and it made no sound. As these three lights got closer they stopped flickering and a from appeared around the lights. The shape was of a triangle craft with the top peak cut off almost in half. The body was a gray color with a gray blue paneling around it. By this time it was hovering over the tree line and was the size of one and a half football fields.  Then as soon as I got a good look at it the ship gradually disappeared, starting a the rear two dimmer lights which faded away like streaks in the sky as if it was traveling at great speeds. The main light gradually diminished in size and raised in the sky as if it took off towards the south east until it fully disappeared. Every thing about this unidentified object was so geometric and precise in it’s shape that it was breath taking. This sighting lasted for about three to five minutes and other motorists on the roads had pulled off to watch this s! trange appearance. Once I got home I called a friend of mine who lives in the Tampa area and told him about the sighting and he confirmed that some in his dorm told him five minutes before exactly what I had explained to him. So I defiantly know I was not the only person aware of this sighting in that area along with the other motorists on the road with me. Let me assure you that I had always felt neutral on the subject of UFOs until what I experienced tonight. Now i am sure that they do exists.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

There was also a military sky jumper involved in the before game activities. I was home at my apartment approximatly less than a mile from the stadium. The aircrafts noise alert me, and I grabbed my Nikon 10X50 6 degree glasses to get a better view of the action. It was during the sky jumper that I notice the UFO. It was triangle shape with sparking flashing lights at each tip. It flew North, and was visible just barely due to heavy clouds in his area of flight only. The other activites aircrafts where performing in perfect VFR condition for viewing. I am 71 years old, retired after 34 years with the Department of the Army. This is my first UFO report, ever.

triangular airplane that sorta looked like it but different hovering over building.;2010-10-30 21:58:00;1 minute;triangular airplane that sorta looked like it but different hovering over building. We My two son ages 14 and 12 and baby age 2 she was asleep.  We were driving home from the Tampa airport about 8 miles away driving on the suncoast pkwy towards home after welcoming home my mother in law.  I look from a distance and of course just thought it was an airplane, but as we got closer it stayed in the same place, I am sure 747's do not hover.   I grew up in Cleveland Ohio and right by the hopkins airport and never seen a plane hover like this,as I got closer it was larger than any plane that of a 747,  This plane that we saw was just hovering over this building, my oldest son said mom its not moving, I said its just a slow desent, trying to keep my eyes on the road as well.  Then I said as we got closer holy crap its not moving! I thought it might be a stealth, since we did have windows down I did not hear anything as far as an airplane engine, it was rather close and still not moving.  I of course did not think anything of it, since it was so close to t! he airport, and macdill airforce base... but with my boys they and now I believe it was a UFO I have never seen an airplane hover like this then just disapear. but not to alarm my 12 yr old who still to this day the movie Signs freaks him out,  I said must be a stealth but my oldest reasoned with me, it couldnt be. Are we right did any one encounter this or are we just seeing a new air craft hover?  I just wish I would have thought to take a pic with my cell phone.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

Bright hovering white light and triangle craft seen over Tampa Bay.;2011-10-26 20:00:00;2 minutes;Bright hovering white light and triangle craft seen over Tampa Bay. I was driving East across the Courtney Campbell Causeway from Clearwater to Tampa, around 9pm when I noticed one of the street lights looked different because the light was white compared to the yellow street lamps, and much brighter, but relatively the same size. When I looked closer I noticed that it was also higher above the street lights and that it was hovering in the air independently.  At this point I drove past it and could no longer see it, but then ahead of me to the right, over the water I saw something else, at first I could only see reddish lights, but they were not blinking like the lights on a plane. It was also moving much slower, and was much lower than planes fly in that area.  It was moving slowly towards me and then at a certain point it flew across the road, a little ahead of me. It was low enough so that I could see it's shape. It was triangular, with red lights on each point and a white light in the middle. Then it flew out of view.  I don't know if it is important or not, but less than an hour earlier, the causeway had the most awful traffic. I was driving home from work and what usually takes 20 minutes took me two full hours. I only bring this up because I have a feeling that the UFO's are sometimes attracted to our energies, both positive and negative.  This is not the first time I have seen these same crafts. In 2009 I was driving from Tampa to Miami and my friend and we saw these same triangles with the lights on them. One also crossed the road over us and flashed very bright beams of light, which seemed to come from the lights on the corners. Then a few minutes later we saw a bright hovering white light over the road, which looked like a thin metal blimp when we passed under it, and on the other side was a bright red light which hid the metal object.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

I came at on this clear night and saw a string of red blinking lights on aircraft that were high up in the sky moving fast from north to south.  It was approximately 8-10 aircraft.  They were going northeast to Southwest.   After a awhile, we weren't able to see them any longer.  The whole event lasted for about 3-4 minutes.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

While sitting in our driveway at the end of a cul-de-sac which backs up to a wooded area, we were roasting marshmallows at 9:30 p.m., when we noticed in the sky three reddish-orange lights in a triangular pattern moving very slowly across the sky.   They seemed to appear suddenly out of nowhere.  We watched the object move north to south and all 3 lights started to dim and the light at the front vertice of the triangle was the last one to go out.  It never returned.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

Traveling from S.W to N.E. over my house in Carrollwood area of Tampa.  There were no clouds and the night sky was clear and stars were all visible.  It appeared at first like a moving star.   I thought it might be a plane but noticed no blinking lights.  It wasn't moving very fast and as it got closer (more directly over head) I noticed 3 straight illuminated lines that formed a triangle surrounding the bright star like point of light in the center of the object.  The lines that formed the triangular border where white in color and the central single light was more yellowish white.   I tried to take some pictures with my cell phone, but could not get any in focus to show the shape of the object.   My wife came out and saw it as well.   It continued on a straight N.E heading and seemed to pick up speed as it traveled away from us.  It made no sound the entire time.   Total time we observed it was 4-5 minutes.   We did not observe any other objects or any craft pursuing UFO.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

I was sitting on my 2nd-floor balcony looking up at the clear sky, looking at the star constellation Ryan's Belt (skies were clear) when this light grey figure crossed my line of sight I was taken back and look to see if it was a flock of birds when I realized the shape was defined, very light luminous grey, no noise at all it was not going very fast and was traveling in a straight line headed South. The event was less than a minute. I could not see it as it traveled further south due to the 2-story building in from of my apartment.  It looked solid & smooth and had the perfect shape of a boomerang. If I had to guess, it was 50 ft on each side of the v shape with 30-40 ft in width on each wing (wider towards the center point). Traveling south towards MacDill Airforce Base I don't think we have anything from the base that makes zero noise. Seemed very surreal- never thought I'd seen a UFO.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
