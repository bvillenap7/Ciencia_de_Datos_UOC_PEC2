Bluish Egg Shaped craft with red and blue blinking lights over Tampa;2007-01-20 18:25:00;20 minutes;Bluish Egg Shaped craft with red and blue blinking lights over Tampa I was walking by the Hillsborough River and saw an unusual object that had 3 red lights that made a triangle shape and occasionally had some blue lights in the back of an egg shaped object that seemed to glow bluish green.  It hovered over the area for several minutes or moved slowly.  It was rather far away and I did not get a really up close view of it.  It seemed larger than a plane from a distance and did not look like any lights that I had seen on an aircraft before or move the way a plane does. It did not look like signal lights either.  Eventually it moved out of sight below the horizon.  It stayed close to the horizon, just above the tree line. The lights did not blink like ordinary plain lights either.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
