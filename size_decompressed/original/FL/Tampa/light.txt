So when the experts assume that everyone is as dumb as the Jerry Springer guests, what else can I say?  Electromagnetic pulses? Sleep deprivation?  Sleep paralysis?  I've had that once, and to mistake it for a needle the size of Texas being probed into your body , what are these experts eluding to.  The answer is obvious for the first time in human existence.  They are with the ones who do this.  Don't worry, actually, worry a lot. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I saw a craft that probably was not from earth.;1998-06-11 21:00:00;30 seconds;I saw a craft that probably was not from earth. There was a sighting previous to this one which displayed certain similarities to the one explained.  We were walking down a boardwalk right after work.  The airport was to the right, to the east - about five miles away.  I saw a light hovering in that direction.  At first it looked to be a helo or close plane.  Then, as quickly as I spotted it, it started moving sporadically first to the left, then to the right, then back, then back, then up, then down, then 20,000 mph to the right and gone.  Don't worry, I'm fully convinced that it was a gov't craft - or worry.  The only thing I have trouble with is that about four years before, I witnessed a craft do the same type of motion, exactly.  And not only that we were talking about that previous experience when this one occurred.  However, my previous observation was of a craft that was so far away it was equal to a satelite in distance.  I grew up watching stars and planets and I do know what I am talking about.  Currently, I own a four and a half inch reflector telescope which I can see the rings on Saturn and the moons of Jupiter.  Well, four of them.  Back to the original story This craft was so close it could have been a local craft before it started to move in a manner consistent with a non-earth-craft type of motion.  I hear the Discovery channel skeptics who relate observations like this one to energy and motion hallucinations.  These people are on the pay-roll, don't listen to them.  If what I saw that night was from here, God help us.  If it wasn't, God really help us.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
Firefly type light seen in Tampa  knight skies.;2002-04-08 09:45:00;15 seconds;Firefly type light seen in Tampa  knight skies. I was coming out of the AMC Westshore theater ,on the top level ,here in Tampa Fl, at around 9:45 P.M with my mother. And I looked up to look at the nightsky and when I did I thought what I saw was a meteorite coming down or skipping around on the atmosphere. So I kept looking but then in less than 3 seconds it turned and began to move very quickly. It was zig zaging like a a person shining a pen light on a board and moving it in motions like a composure. That is why I thought it was a meteorite skipping off the atmosphere at first. Then I realized that it was going in and out and underneath and above the clouds. It moved from the first time I saw it from my right to my left and then continued toward the south all in the space of about 10-30 seconds. Nothing to my knowledge could have even endured the Gforces. Also the speed was tremendous. It traveled at about 5 miles within 5 seconds.I had already pointed it to my mother and at first she thought I was joking then she saw it. She said she would never get over it. I too am as amazed. I have wanted to see something like this for 22 years and now it's happened. I would also like to make clear that it looked like a firefly (except no trails of light behind) and that it was not only going above and through clouds it would also be clearly seen from the backdrop of space. There was no light from the ground creating it also. This light was very clearly a UFO and it like I said looked like a firefly form where I was standing but the way it moved in the sky and above the clouds and around I know it was not because it was as high up as the clouds.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

It was moving fast accross the horizon.  I first thought it was an airplane except that it was moving much too fast.  I kept my eye on the object looking for blinking lights to indicate that it was an airplane but never saw them.  I watched it cross the horizon over my house then it vanished.  Approximately 20 seconds later there were 3 aircrafts in the sky which did not appear to be commerical carriers then 4 more appeared for a total of 7.

((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch out of Cape Canaveral.  PD))  UFO Sighting 04-29-05 Tampa, FL;2005-04-29 21:05:00;approximately 10 minutes;UFO Sighting 04-29-05 Tampa, FL My boyfriend and I were in the parking lot of Logan's Roadhouse Restuarant in the Veterans plaza around 9pm at night.  A light in the sky caught our attention, so we decided to stand there and observe it.   It was a red light with a tail located in the sky above the field directly across the street from the restaurant.  At first, we thought it was a flare, but quickly dismissed that it wasn't because it wasn't moving upwards.  Rather, it was moving very slowly towards our direction.  The tail faded out as the light slowed down to a stop and eventually became a solitary red light.  We watched it for several minutes and during this time, it stayed stationary.  We ran through all of the possibilities of what it could be and we were just stunned having seen nothing like this before.  I even remember looking around the packed parking lot and seeing if anyone else was observing the same thing.   We decided to move on because nothing was happening.  After walking a short distance, I thought to myself to just take one more look.  I'm glad I did because what I observed next was shocking. The red light had grown into a full-fledged self-contained exploding orb in the sky.  I know that sounds weird, but it's almost as if the light were in a clear balloon and exploding within the balloon.  There was no sound as this happened either and we thought that was weird.  Next, the bright orb dimmed and became white, then split into three separate white orbs.  Two headed southward and one headed northward.    The two headed southward traveled a short distance until one literally faded out and the other looked perfectly like a star amongst the others in the night sky and just stayed there.  The one headed northward also faded ever so slightly at a slow pace in the sky and also eventually looked like another star in the night sky. That is what we observed from the time the red light caught our attention until the three orbs faded and blended in with the night sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch out of Cape Canaveral.

There’s three of them – they were very excited and agitated I jumped out of the bed and told my husband to put the movie on pause and ran out the front door, by the time I got out side there was only what looked like one bright star over my house, my son said there were three (they were the size of my fist) and two disappeared… I continued to watch the star and it moved slightly just barley enough to think it was moving then it blew up! It looked like fireworks a burst of white in a complete circle around the star and then it was further away – you could barley see it in the sky, as it moved further away another appeared beside it and they gradually disappeared. It really shook me up... if I have ever doubted in my life they didn’t exist I know now from the tip of my toes to the top of my head they are “REAL”!!

Flickering light in Tampa, FL;2006-02-08 21:00:00;2 minutes;Flickering light in Tampa, FL I was walking my dog in my backyard which has some woods about 20 feet from my back door.  It was around 9:00 p.m. and I looked up at the sky toward the North. I saw about two planes and then saw a whitish/yellowish big light that was flickering and was definitely too low and big to be an airplane.  It was not moving in the sky, just flickering.  No noise was heard, as it was not THAT close.  I watched it for about 30 seconds then called my friend to come see.  By the time he got there (about 30 seconds later), the big light had faded out slowly and risen in the sky.  It was now a lot higher and looked like an airplane high in the sky with a red light flashing.  We watched as it flew away to the West at the speed of a regular plane.  I KNOW that could not have been an airplane, as it was stationary at one point and it rose very high in a matter of seconds.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
Two single, white lights travelling S to N at moderate speed & altitude caused electrical disturbance to car.;2006-06-15 21:45:00;20 sec.;Two single, white lights travelling S to N at moderate speed & altitude caused electrical disturbance to car. At 9:45pm on 06/15/06 I was driving E on 275, going 55mph, about 1/4 mile before the I-4 junction. My girlfriend was driving directly behind me.  All of my interior lights went out in my car.  I picked up my cell phone to call my girlfriend behind me to ask her if my tail lights were still on.  As it rang, the lights came back on and I saw a single light cross the over my car from S to N.   My girlfriend told me when we got back to the apartment that she never saw my tail lights go out and her phone never rang.  I put the phone down and saw another light cross over my car from S to N. The lights were white, steady and round.  I was in moderate traffic so I wasn't able to give the lights more than a glance so I couldn't estimate speed or altitude.  I assume other people saw them because the traffic in front of me slowed down to 45mph as this was going on.  It reminded me of driving under a plane as it comes in for a landing.  My radio was off and I didn't hear any noise.  I work very close to Tampa International Airport, right in the flight path.  I was a few miles E of there when this happened.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

Zoomed photographs show erratic motion pattern EVEN MORE INTERESTING IS: During the past 4 nights I have observed a wobbling star in the sky. The same star that shines brightest, near the moon. Seriously, I live in Tampa Florida. Please walk outside and see if you see this for yourself. I have captured it on digital film, without a flash and you can clearly see erratic movement patterns. I have over 35 pictures posted, including some zoomed in, in which the wobbling motion is highly visible.  Also,included are contrast shots including stationary buildings and the moon for a point of reference. WHAT ARE YALL'S THOUGHTS ON THIS? The bright star, near the moon, ... it's moving! (though mostly stationary) but absolutely moving unlike anything of OUR technology!!!  And no, it is not a satellite, or space probe.

As I was enjoying the perfect night, the star began to move slowly, almost floating along in mostly straight line.  Then I noticed very unreal types of movement.

Tried to get media of thus event but was too far away.   Within that hour 4 more crafts were seen at about the same distance with identical movements.  At one point I was able to see the one vessel emit other colors like orange and blue.  All 5 seemed very  far away.

I initially thought it was a plane. It was slowly swaying across the sky in a pattern that was unlike a plane or helicopter.   The night was cloudy.  I could barely see the moon, and no stars.  It was definitely beneath the cloud coverage.   It had one red light and two white lights.  It moved from the east (from the furthest possible point I could see) to west, then hovered in the western sky.   I looked at it though binoculars, but could see no definition or shape the lights were clearer.  I ran inside to wake my wife.  She came out and was unimpressed, until it turned a much brighter red (the white lights either turned off or were overshadowed by the red lights) and quickly descended, swaying downward.

Looking south, over what would be the Wal-Mart area near Gunn Highway, we thought what a very bright red star.  Amazing to see such a close bright vibrant red star, and somewhat next to it was a red star nearly as bright and also seemingly closer to the Earth too.  Then the brighter of the two just started rising high up into the sky.  Once it got extremely high it would seem like just another hard to see star.  It would flash a time or two and then disappear.  Then the other star next to it moved off to left of it in a westerly direction, and slowly started to move high up into the sky just as the first one did, and then it did the same thing.  It just blinked out.  As soon as it did, another very bright red star popped into existence low into the sky and just sat there, still, not moving.  After about 5-10 seconds, it repeated what it had done before, just as it would be ready to blink out from being seen (it would reach a high level in the sky and then stop and then vanish from being seen), there would appear a super vibrant red light down low in the sky and this pattern repeated again and again for 3-4 cycles.  We stopped to watch this in complete awe, and then after watching it for 5 minutes, it all just stopped.  About 3 minutes later, 2 very bright red lights/sphere just appeared high in the sky, but relatively low (like when the GoodYear Blimp is very high up, but comparatively low in relation to clouds/stars).  We had a great look at the brilliance of these two relatively close red lights, but then honestly we became a little nervous.  It was just me, the wife, and the dog.  I am a lawyer.  These stories about visits and encounters always seem to end poorly for humans, and it was uncharacteristically quiet for our apartment complex in terms of there being little people traffic/movement at 1am on a Saturday night.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

Extremely bright white, stationary light, no details of object observable other than the bright light. Near Bill Currie Ford dealership;2017-04-18 00:45:00;30-45 minutes;Extremely bright white, stationary light, no details of object observable other than the bright light. Near Bill Currie Ford dealership I exited my house at 12:45 am to pick my daughter in law up from the airport (she was supposed to arrive at 1 am).  I took a quick look around, thinking at this hour, maybe I'll see something.  I immediately noticed a bright white light to the north of my house.  At first, I thought it was a helicopter, as it was over a main road (Dale Mabry) in our area but there were no other lights - just an extremely bright, stationary white light.  From the position, it looked like it was about a half mile from my house, just north of Hillsborough/Dale Mabry.  It was completely silent.  If it had been a helicopter, I would have heard it, as this area is subject to frequent auto accidents. I was in a rush to get to the airport, but kept an eye on the object in my rear view mirror as I was heading south to the airport.  TIA has a cell phone waiting lot, so while I was waiting there, I kept looking but couldn't see it from where I was. Once we were on our way back to the house, we had a brief glimpse of it through some trees but by the time we got back to where we would have been able to see it clearly, it was gone.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
I saw a long green light traveling in a diagonal moving towards the Tampa side of Gandy Bridge.;2017-09-16 05:40:00;15 seconds;I was driving across the Gandy Bridge heading towards Tampa, when I saw a long green light traveling in a diagonal moving towards the Tampa side and then it just disappears like turning off a light.  It was green and cigar is shape.  I could not tell size or distance and I'm really good at that.  Former land surveyor.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

Very bright disk light object at a dead stop in the sky signals then zooms away.;2018-03-11 19:45:00;0:44;Very bright disk light object at a dead stop in the sky signals then zooms away. On Sunday March 11th, 2018, a fairly bright light hovering in the sky caught my attention.  Upon further inspection, I can make out a disk shape in the sky basically parked in place. I'm always looking up hoping to see UFO's but I'm a semi-skeptical person.  So I stare at if for a while.  My little brother is fairly close to me, he follows my gaze and then rolls his eyes and says Izzy relax, its probably just a plane.  To which I respond, No David, look.  See behind that thing?  Moving slowly with the light? THATS a plane and I point at a plane clearly visible much much farther BEHIND the object, moving slowly, and clearly identifiable by its blinking red navigation light. This proved two things.  The object was definitely parked in place, and it was not an ordinary aircraft because although the sun has set at 7:36, it was around 7:45 at the time and it was still bright out.  NOT bright enough for a normal aircraft to have its brights on.   The airplane cruising in the far distance only had a faint plane-shaped figure with no other lights on other than its red blinking navigation lights.  We both agree that this is weird, and as he continues to go on with his business (he was washing our mothers vehicle at the time of the incident). I decide to take out my phone and take a video of it. At this moment two things begin to happen.  My mother comes out of her adobe and I point at the UFO and tell her mom look, it has NOT moved and as I say those words I notice that there has been a change in the object.  The previously bright shining constant light emitted from the bottom of the aircraft has turned into a single light circling around and around the base of the aircraft.  After a few cycles, the light sequence changes yet again, but this time it does a sequential light signal pointing in the direction it is about to zoom to.  After five sequences it zooms at an impossible speed silently. Video can be seen here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IIMh0mU6eI;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
Unexplained Lights in Night Sky North of Tampa.;2018-03-23 20:35:00;2 minutes;Unexplained Lights in Night Sky North of Tampa. My wife and I were walking through the parking lot of the Pepin Center in Tampa, Florida, when I pointed out to her two lights in the north-northeast sky at approximately 20 degrees from the horizon. They were about the size and intensity of brightness as Sirius.  They were a thumb's distance apart and stationary. I pointed out to my wife that I didn't know of any constellation with stars that bright in the north sky in the Tampa area at this or any other time of the year.  After about a minute, the two stationary lights dimmed and then disappeared. Thoroughly perplexed as to what these were - - they were not satellites, meteorites, rockets/missiles,or aircraft landing lights.  Their altitude and actual size was impossible to determine. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Good evening Mr. Davenport: It's an honor to hear from you! I am very familiar with the landing lights of all manner of aircraft. I am both an aviation and astronomy buff and am well acquainted with both spheres of study. Within moments after this sighting, I did see a commercial airliner (by engine sound and configuration of landing and navigation lights, likely an Airbus A-319 or A-320 series or a Boeing 737) at about 5,000' AGL commencing a downwind (heading south for a north landing on Runway 35R) approach to Tampa International Airport(KTPA). That aircraft was due west when I spotted it - - I did wonder if anyone in it on its port side might have seen these two lights, but I suspect the lights were possibly too high and too far north to be seen in the field of vision of those in the cabin  - - I would love to know if someone did and was thinking that then!). The color of these lights was not typical of the landing lights of any aircraft that I have seen - - they were the same color, hue and intensity of self illuminated stars or reflective sunlight on satellites.  Although aircraft landing lights can and will often appear stationary, based on distance from, and the heading of, aircraft, such light inevitably moves or grows in intensity as it heads toward you.  Landing lights are seen either coming toward you or from the side, but would not be seen heading heading away from you.   My initial thought after knowing that these lights were not a normal part of the night sky for this part of the year was that they were satellites - - the major problem being that both of them did not move for several minutes but remained stationary.  Their fade out took about 5 seconds and was gradual and simultaneous - - both my wife and I were flummoxed by what we saw.

(Star) Spherical light moving through the sky in irregular patterns.  ((anonymous report));2018-07-13 19:00:00;45 seconds;(Star) Spherical light moving through the sky in irregular patterns Have had many odd spiritual/other kind experiences standing outside grilling with some friends and I get this urge to look straight up and I immediately focus on a light moving through the sky. This light was a star.  It was outside of our atmosphere and if it was standing completely still you would recognize it as a star.  Problem is, it was not standing still but moving in irregular, non-human patterns.  No piece of human technology known could make a movement like this. I knew what it was instantly but wanted everyone else to check it out to confirm once they saw it, they started trying to explain what it was.  “It’s a drone.” “It’s a plane”. Those objections only lasted a few seconds as we stared at it cross the sky in the same irregular patterns.  One person freaked out and went inside.  The others sat and watched as it slowly disappeared and after we discussed what we had just seen. Please tell me someone else in the Tampa area saw this?

Observed a very fast moving light flying level, 15 degrees above the horizon.  Craft was traveling in the WSW sky from Tampa approx  24;2019-04-12 23:00:00;5 seconds;Observed a very fast moving light, flying level, 15 degrees above the horizon.  Craft was traveling in the WSW sky from Tampa approx. 240 degrees, going west until dropped from visible sight due to distance. Estimate of distance offshore from Tampa – if it was in the atmosphere 30-40 miles out and 40,000 feet high – would have needed to be traveling multiple mach, example hyper-sonic, Mach 5-6 is guess.  If it was exo-atmosphere, it would have needed to be significantly faster, as it crossed the sky at a 45 degree angle, going away from us, going from very visible to distant, to out of sight in 4-5 seconds.   I am open to being contacted if investigation is made. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness, and he sounded to us to be very serious, and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello Peter See below original summary, but I thought about something today that is interesting Last night, the reason we saw this object in the first place, is because we were focused on an area of the sky, that had a flickering light, I had just told my wife, that is a satellite, not a star, because of the evident flicker, those are the solar panels….  We were using an app on my android phone called “Skyview” – this app shows all object in the sky including satellites, spent rockets etc…   The flickering light was stationary and Bright.  The Phone app did not recognize it, I tried to load update to the app, to see if it would then identify. Then, we saw the fast moving object, directly from same general location.  I stopped thinking about the flickering object, and am not certain if it remained…  I believe it did.  So I do not think the fast object was the original Flickering object… but small chance it was the same.  I am just not certain now, as I did not connect the 2 objects last night… only today did I think about the location and the possibility that they were in some way connected. Also, you said last night that there was a similar report from Arkansas, and also something reported West of Spokane.  I used Google Earth, and made a Pin Drop out West of Tampa over the Gulf.  Another West of Spokane, and noted that the line traverses directly over Arkansas.  (See attached) Let me know if you have any questions Also – What were the times the Arkansas and Spokane reported?  I believe mine was very close to 2300 EST ((END ADDENDUM));28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902

I was outside my house with my Boyfriend and I saw a red light in the sky in the same spot for about 10 minutes.;2020-01-24 00:00:00;10 minutes;I was outside my house with my Boyfriend and I saw a red light in the sky in the same spot for about 10 minutes. I’m not too sure about the day but It was night time and I was standing outside with my boyfriend.  We were talking relaxing and I notice a red dot/light and I ignored it at first because it was not unusual to see airplanes through the day sometimes and airplanes have red lights as well.  So then 5 minutes go by and I look back up and the red dot/light was still there.  Obviously that wasn’t an airplane because it was one single red light and I thought of a helicopter but then again the red light looked like it was very far away and I heard no noise what so ever but I knew I saw that red light very bright and easily.  Then again I ignored it once again and another 5 minutes go by and I was ready to go back inside my house and I look back up and it was still there in the same spot.  I tried to take a picture with my phone but you couldn’t see it at all on camera. I then proceed to go inside my house.  Apart from that I do not know how much longer that red light was! in the sky.;28.0002499045019;-82.49022139902
