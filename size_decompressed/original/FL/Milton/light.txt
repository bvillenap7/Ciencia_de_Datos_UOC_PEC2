Large, bright white object seen over Milton Florida for 7 hours;2020-10-11 07:00:00;5 hours;Large, bright white object seen over Milton Florida for 7 hours At 6:45 AM my family of 5 started out on our morning walk of 80 minutes in Milton Florida. My young children love the moon, so I looked up at the sky to point it out to them. Next to the moon we saw a bright mass about 1 hands width away from the moon. The object looked like a super bright, white star that was about 10 times larger than a regular star. If I held a flax seed in my fingers and put it against the sky at arms length, this is about the size the object seemed to be in the sky. My two older children (6 and 4), my husband, and my mom were all able to see the object. The object was stationary upon my first observations. The color was a bright white. The object had better clarity than the moon and was more white than the moon. The moon looked grey or bluish next to the object. The object appeared to be slightly darker in the center and the shape was ever so slightly oblong. It was immediately obvious that it was a new feature in the sky. W! e watched it for several minutes and took a video and pictures. We then continued on our walk and periodically while on our walk, we checked the object and noted its position relative to the moon. The moon was on its path across the sky, but the object seemed to shift from one to two hand lengths from the moon over the next 5 hours. The color never changed, except that as the sun rose higher in the sky,the darker center seemed to lighten up. This could have been due to more light in sky from the sun.  I contacted relatives across the US. Locations were Wyoming, Arizona, and Ohio. Ohio sky was covered by rain clouds  and Wyoming sky was covered by forest fire smoke. My step sister in Arizona could not see the object where she was.  Between 9am and 10am I sat outside and watched the object with my kids. I tried to determine all I could. It did not change shape or color. The Location did change over the time it was viewable, but the movement was as gradual as the moons movement. It seemed to stay between 1 and 2 hand-widths away from the moon. It was 100% obvious in the sky. It looked like a bright white star that was about 10 times larger than a star. Initially (7am), the object was 45 degrees up from the horizon, but by 11am, the object was just about straight above me. The shift was gradual, as slight as the moon shifting positions.  Around 11am, I drove to my mom's house in Gulf Breeze Florida. She was able to see the object as well from her location. When I arrived at her location, the  clouds obstructed my view but the clouds were low and moving fast so I was able to check the  location over the next few hours. I left Gulf Breeze around 4pm and there were too many clouds in the sky for me to determine the objects location. The last view was around 2pm. The object was straight up in the sky.  My husband was working on Hurlburt field from 11am until 10pm on this day. Clouds obstructed his view for much of the day. The sky was clear by his drive home around 9 pm, but the object was not in the sky as far he could tell. He took pictures of the object as well.;30.6454707964602;-87.1094132743363
