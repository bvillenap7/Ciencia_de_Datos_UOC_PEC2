I saw a row of orange lights off in the distance.;2011-06-16 21:00:00;5 minutes;I was driving home along American Farms Rd.  I was headed east when I saw a row of orange lights off in the distance.  The lights were low in the sky but noticeably above the horizon. There was also consider military activity in the area but these were not normal military aircraft.  They fly around here all the time and I am quite familiar with how they look and sound both day and night.  These were something else entirely. I saw them briefly as I crested the hill and could see them for a little bit as I drove down the hill.   Upon arriving home I went into my backyard to try to see them but they had gone.;30.6454707964602;-87.1094132743363
