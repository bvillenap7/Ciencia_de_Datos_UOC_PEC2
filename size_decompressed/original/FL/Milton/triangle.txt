Made only a low humming noise. coming home from ball practice, my daughter and myself saw this black triangular craft.  We stopped the car at the end of the drive way and turned engine off to listen. Heard low humming noise, Craft appeared to be on flight coming from the direction of Eglin AFB headed toward Pensacola NAS.  Moon was small sliver no clouds seen. the lights were: one on the front tip, one in the middle of each side and oone on each wing tip or the points of the triangle on the sides, the back was straight across without lights, one red flashing light in the middle of the underneath side.;30.6454707964602;-87.1094132743363
Strange large triangle shaped object low in the sky;2003-03-10 22:35:00;20 seconds;Strange large triangle shaped object low in the sky It was approx 10:30pm and I was taking out the trash. The street/area I live in has very few street lights and its easy to see the night sky.  I was not looking up but had a strange feeling and looked up to see something that I am not sure if i was hallucinating , but it was a large dark triangle shaped object ,at least 80 feet long and about 50feet wide at it widest point, with a large blueish light on the bottom of each tip of the triangle. I heard I think a faint humm and thought I could actually see that the bottom of this thing was not smooth but had form and small dips and valleys in it ,something machine/manmade i guess you can say. I was in shock at what I was seeing cause it appeared to be only about 200 feet up in the air , but it was hard to look at , almost like there was a blurry haze around it. I looked down to clear my eyes and looked back up and it had either gotten smaller or quickly went to a higher altitude . I looked down again to clear my eyes from the light and looked back up and it was gone.  I dont drink, dont smoke, dont do drugs. I was tired , but I still dont know what I saw and not completely sure if I saw it . It was like a dream, but I dont think I was dreaming. It was an unusual experience indeed and to be honest I am not 100% sure that I saw what I saw, or maybe I just dont want to , it gave me such an strange scary feeling when I saw the object. I felt impending doom.;30.6454707964602;-87.1094132743363
A Dozen Trianglar Bright Shapes at once;2003-09-17 20:10:00;10 min;A Dozen Trianglar Bright Shapes at once We were driving home from church, and turned on our road.  Up in the sky to the south was 13-14 bright trianglar shapes in the sky.  They were moving fast, taking turns almost into a dive.  I pulled into our driveway and watched for approx. 6-7 mins, and one by one they dived and disappeared.  The last one seemed to dive a couple of times before it disappeared.  What was strange is that the closeness and the speed of these objects.  There was no noise.  I am used to seeing airplanes and such go over our house, but these were not airplanes.  They were too close and too fast to be airplanes.;30.6454707964602;-87.1094132743363
During a power outage I heard unusually loud roaring from a nearby naval base and saw a triangular shaped orange craft.;2008-06-29 20:15:00;2 hours;During a power outage I heard unusually loud roaring from a nearby naval base and saw a triangular shaped orange craft. On June 29, 2008 my hometown of Milton, Florida experienced extremely volatile thunderstorms for most of the early morning hours continuing for most of the day.  As a result our electricity went out numerous times for a few minutes each until approximately 7:45 pm when it went out for what turned out to be over two hours.  My family home is located right next to Whiting Field NAS helicopter training school (check my address on Google Earth - we have the y-shaped driveway) and during the ten years we have lived here we  have grown accustomed to seeing and hearing a variety of aircraft on a regular basis.  On one occasion a few years ago we had the unexpected pleasure of watching the famous Blue Angels practicing at Whiting for a show on Pensacola Beach.  During their practice we only had to stand on our front porch or in the yard to see the spectacular show firsthand, and the planes were flying so low we could even make out the yellow lettering on each plane.  We also were privy to the enormous noise of the six jets flying in formation which was VERY loud.  On this particular Sunday evening in June, however, we learned that the noise of the Blue Angels paled in comparison to what we heard that night.  At approximately 8:15 that evening my husband and father decided to take a ride toward town to see how extensive the power outage was.  As they were leaving I stepped onto the front porch to smoke a cigarette and as they drove down our driveway an extremely loud roaring began emanating from the direction of Whiting Field.  At first I simply thought that there was some sort of large jet taking off from there (even though they cannot ordinarily accommodate the largest jets), but the noise continued to increase in volume until our windows began vibrating violently and dishes and glassware began to topple over.  This jet-like noise was at least ten times louder than the six Blue Angel jets had been and continued for at least five minutes until it began fading out, but when it ended it did not sound like a regular takeoff.  Immediately after the loud noise subsided we began hearing a large number of varying types of aircraft.  My son is a Navy veteran who worked on jets and can easily differentiate between different types of engines and he identified several helicopters, small jets, and even prop planes.  Although some of these aircraft sounded familiar to us we all agreed that they were not all the usual training helicopters and planes, plus there was still enough daylight to view them with binoculars and many did not have the distinctive orange and white coloring or the customary lighting.  My son said that it sounded like every aircraft on the base had been scrambled, and those in the air did not fly in the same direction they usually do, but maintained a large circular formation.  During this flurry of activity I was looking northeast (Whiting field is west of us) and was stunned to see a bright yellow-orange glow in a vaguely triangular shape.  We have a water tower adjoining our property and this gave me some perspective regarding the size of the craft and it was larger than the tower.  Due to the power outage it was pitch black outside and we are certain that there could have been no other source of the light, which began to pulse (NOT blink or flicker).  This craft flew in a westerly direction for a short distance and then flew straight up very briefly and simply vanished as if the light had switched off, but it never made any noise at all.  The other aircraft continued to fly over many times until the power came back on around 10:00 pm and shortly thereafter ceased completely.  In addition to my son and me, other witnesses included my other son and my mother, and when they returned my husband and father informed us that they had also heard the noise and thought they saw something in the sky that was not typical of the aircraft we usually see.  My older son and I were the only ones outside who witnessed the actual orange colored craft. Due to the extreme volume of the roar that preceded the extraordinary flurry of aircraft taking off from Whiting Field we were all terrified of what was happening.  It is so unusual to see aircraft that late at night, and we simply could not imagine what was causing all the commotion. The timing in relation to the storm and power outage also was very unsettling – it started right after the power went out and ended right after the power came back on.  Of course the base has its own sources of power, so we were perplexed about why this event would coincide with a neighborhood outage.  The next morning I was unable to find any reference to this event when I checked the regular internet news websites for our area, both newspaper and television.  I even called the local paper and the administration offices of Whiting field.  The Pensacola News Journal had no reports of anything unusual other than storm damage and the gentleman I spoke with on the base said he had no reports of anything out of the ordinary either. This was a little hard to swallow.  Due to the fact that some members of our family, especially my husband, had seen unexplained events before in and around Pensacola, my family insisted that I report what happened although we had never felt compelled to do so before.  If your organization is able to find out what may or may not have happened we would greatly appreciate it.  Perhaps I haven’t waited long enough to give others time to report it locally, but I suspect there may be no other reports because no one here will take me seriously.  Any help you can give us in this matter will be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.;30.6454707964602;-87.1094132743363
Triangular craft, maybe three in formation, flying South over Milton, Fl.;2019-05-31 21:45:00;15 seconds;Triangular craft, maybe three in formation, flying South over Milton, Fl Friday, 5/31/19, took pets outside before bedtime, at approximately 9:45pm Central Time.  Was about 25 feet into yard, looking back toward house.  Facing South.  Always look at stars but this time was shocked to see that there was a triangular craft, which was very lightly illuminated at the three corners and not very high, flying overhead at a speed that was undeterminable.   I think the illumination might have possibly been the lights from city of Milton (FL) and of surrounding subdivisions reflecting on the craft. Without that illumination the craft would have been nearly, if not completely, invisible.  As it was it was not something one would notice without being directly under the flight path I don’t think.  It was flying from North to South and made absolutely no noise whatsoever.  As the craft flew over it appeared to turn in an South-Eastward direction.   At this point it almost appeared that it might have been three triangular craft flying in a format! ion which gave the appearance of being one larger craft.  The craft disappeared from sight as it turned but not because of distance.  I think because ground lights reflecting upward lost the angle which caused the craft to be highlighted.  Watched for it for about 10 more minutes but did not see it again.;30.6454707964602;-87.1094132743363
Possible UFO;2020-11-14 01:52:00;30 mins;Possible UFO Shining red object in the sky with three lights. Moving left and right up and down only. Quickly moves in either direction. Object is staying at the tree lines and slowly hovering. We thought it was a satellite however the object is making a some what circular pattern. Watched it for about 15 mins and saw it move straight up. Glowing circular haze around the object.;30.6454707964602;-87.1094132743363

Right before hwy 89 came up on my right-hand side, 3 bright lights in a triangle shape caught my eye for about 8 or so seconds. Between 500ft to 2000ft in ele. moving southwest at 300-600 mph in a steady line. Lost sight because of tress after less than 10 seconds. Lights were moving in perfect unison so I assume it was one craft that was triangle shape but it was dark an only saw the lights.;30.6454707964602;-87.1094132743363
