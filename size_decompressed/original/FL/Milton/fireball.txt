Two silent flying fireballs.;2018-07-27 20:35:00;1-2 minutes;Two silent flying fireballs. Observed two fireball appearing objects coming from the south and headed north.  There was one following the other, less than 1/4 mile apart.  They both turned towards the East, gaining altitude and disappeared.  They made no sound, and there were no port or starboard running lights or strobes.  There was no visible airframe.   Just two pulsating orange lights of equal intensity. There was no hovering or bobbling.  They did not match any descriptions of anything I have ever seen in the sky before.  The altitude was less than the helicopters that fly around from the close by Navy flight school, but higher than I have seen drones.  They did not look like Chinese lanterns or flares. I saw exactly the same thing two years ago when I was living in another state. I did not have my phone on me at the time.  I tried to get my son to come outside, but he did not hear me calling him and ringing the doorbell.;30.6454707964602;-87.1094132743363
Two flaming balls falling from the sky in Milton Florida, April 10, 2019;2019-04-10 19:20:00;>5-10 minutes;Two flaming balls falling from the sky in Milton Florida, April 10, 2019 I was on break at Waffle House off of Avalon Blvd. and Highway 10, when I spotted two flaming balls falling usually slow from the sky, a bit of a distance away.  I have videos of the objects, just not sure how to send them to you.  I thought it might be space junk, but Iâ€™ve seen no reports about it.;30.6454707964602;-87.1094132743363
