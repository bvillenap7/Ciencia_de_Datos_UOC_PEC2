Lights in the sky;2019-10-17 19:32:00;2 mins;Lights in the sky As I was driving down the street I noticed bright yellow circles in the sky. The lights started the flash off one by one in sequence. Looked exactly like the pheonix lights! All the lights turned off and the sky went black. About 10 mins later the lights came back in and where in a different position! The light sequence happened again. Did not see after that.;30.6454707964602;-87.1094132743363
