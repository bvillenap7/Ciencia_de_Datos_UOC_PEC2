Black cloud vortex appears, and I lose tens minutes of time that I cannot account for.;2003-10-31 15:05:00;ten minutes;Black cloud vortex appears, and I lose tens minutes of time that I cannot account for. On friday I was driving to Pensacola Fl to visit my parents...I live in Vernon, which is about an hour and a half away...When I was close to Milton, FL I saw a strange black moving cloud in the sky...Now keep in mind that it was a beautiful sunshiny day...it was about three pm...the cloud seemed to be moving like a vortex...When I saw it I could not take my eyes off of it...The next thing I remember is crossing the bridge on the interstate going into pensacola...I lost TEN minutes...I do not even remember driving those ten minutes...My daughter was with me, but she was asleep during all of this.....Could this be an abduction?;30.6454707964602;-87.1094132743363
