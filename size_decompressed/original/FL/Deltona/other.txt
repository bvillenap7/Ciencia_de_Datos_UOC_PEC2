When they got closer you could see they were shaped like boomerangs by the reflection of the orange light in their centers.   They took off in a V pattern.  There was no sound.   The first one broke off and disappeared in the stratosphere.  The other two continued on their same pattern in the east.   Next, another one came up out of the east and followed the same path.  It was also orange but a perfect circle in shape.  It just fizzled out when it got into the broken clouds.  Next, there was another object that came from the west headed east that was green in color.  This also just fizzed out.;28.9039760000001;-81.2385859999997
