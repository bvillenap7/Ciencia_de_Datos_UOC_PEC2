Very bright fireball over Deltona Florida skies;2005-09-20 18:30:00;2 seconds?;Very bright fireball over Deltona Florida skies On the evening of Tuesday September 20, 2005, my fianceé and I were sitting out on the deck by the pool, just chatting after a hard days work. At around 6:30 PM or so, I looked up at the sky (something very bright caught my attention from the corner of my eyes). As I looked up I saw this HUGE BRIGHT ROUND FIREBALL (not really a fireball, but instead a huge bright round ball). I called out to my fianceé and we saw as this ball travelled West to East at an incredible speed. It was an intense blue with pinkish hues of color. It trailed what I would describe as a fire tail. It made absolutely no sound though it was low enough we though it would crash. What really caught our attention was the intensity of its brilliance. Though it was still daylight its brilliance was greater than the daylight itself. We watched in amazement as it started to plummet downwards and all of a sudden it simply dissapeared in front of our eyes. It did not fall nor did it fly away, it just simply dissapeared in a yet brighter color than it previously had. All that was left behind was a small, thin trail of smoke. This incident was only a couple of seconds long. Did anyone else see anything on the evening of September 20, 2005 over the Florida's skies? My fianceé and I are still in shock and even asked family, friends and co - workers, no one else saw anything. What was it? It was definitely not a meteor or shooting star (too close to be that). It has been by far the scariest experience I've had in my life.;28.9039760000001;-81.2385859999997
Orange flickering fireball;2008-08-02 21:30:00;3 minutes;Orange flickering fireball I was sitting on my back patio and out of no where popped up one fire ball object slowly crossing the sky from north west to south east. I grabbed my binoculars and was able to focus on the object for one or two seconds. It appeared that the object was comprised of three smaller balls of orange glowing and flickering fire. It set fairly low in the sky. and simply faded away like a extinguished fire and was gone. four people witnessed this event.And there was no sound;28.9039760000001;-81.2385859999997
Red fireballs over Deltona, FL;2012-07-04 21:30:00;30 minutes;Red fireballs over Deltona, FL On the night of July 4, 2012 we were at the porch looking to the fireworks when suddenly, I detected a different orange to red light.  At the moment I thought it was a flare, but it moved to the left and front up and down and had a behavior not typical of a flare.  After this one disappeared the next one appeared more or less in the same place and traced a similar path.  I am sure they were not flares because the behavior was not of flares.  They stopped, moved to the left, stopped, move and stopped again. When looking with the binoculars we could notice a red ring.  When the red color vanished, we saw a dark disc.  The other two people got scared and went inside.  I stayed outside watching when three more lights appeared.  The last one looked bigger and when I tried to take a picture, it disappeared. The lights appeared in the sky at: more or less 65° NE and moved to the left. The last one moved farther north to more or less: 29° NE. The lights were seen at more or less 30° angle from our position and probably between 800 to 1500 feet high.  I got the feeling that they were camouflaging with the rest of the fireworks that night. I saw five of these red balls. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));28.9039760000001;-81.2385859999997

Falling blue sphere.;2015-02-20 23:21:00;a few seconds;Falling blue sphere. I was sitting facing the back opposite of my friends.  They were all talking and I happened to look up,  and at that moment, this bright deep blue and very defined sphere was falling very quickly from the sky, leaving a bright blue trail behind it.   It took me a second to register what I was seeing.  I thought maybe a falling star or meteor,  but I'd seen lots of those, and none of  them looked close to this.   By the time I realized this was a ufo and started to yell for my friends to turn around, it had fallen completely, and away from view.  We looked into it and searched for images  of lightning balls, meteors, limbs, etc., but nothing came even close to what I saw.   Very confused.;28.9039760000001;-81.2385859999997
