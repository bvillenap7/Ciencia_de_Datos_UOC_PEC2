Disk shape with red glowing light beneath it;2014-06-22 20:35:00;15 minutes;Disk shape with red glowing light beneath it At 20:30 I went out to my backyard to get fresh air and called a friend.  I was facing north while conversing when I spotted 2 objects coming from the north and glowing red. I could not take a video at the moment while on the phone so I ended the call but as they flew overhead I saw a round disk shape and a glowing red light underneath. I took two videos of 2 separate objects.  There was actually 4 objects but the first 2 were flying together the next one came about 1 minute after and the next was about 30 seconds after the 3rd one.  I looked for more but did not spot anymore in the sky.;28.9039760000001;-81.2385859999997

I looked for more but did not spot anymore in the sky.   Hard to tell the elevation but I believe they were maybe about 1,500 to 2,000 feet, and the objects' elevation did not change they stayed at the same level.

I have a video of a flying saucer but don't know how to share it. It was insane.;2017-05-12 21:00:00;90 seconds;I have a video of a flying saucer but don't know how to share it. It was insane. Came outside and saw a bright red light in the sky.  Knew immediately it wasn't an airplane or helicopter.  It was flying approx 5-10k feet when spotted.   I pulled my phone out and started recording.  When I zoomed in it was an obvious saucer traveled from one end of the sky to over the horizon in about 90 seconds.  Also gained altitude extremely fast.   How do I share the video?;28.9039760000001;-81.2385859999997
