I noticed in the sky a large part of the sky began to look funny.  It began to morph while remaining transparent.  I noticed the stars in that segment of the sky began to glow funny. Suddenly, one of the stars began to morph in shape.  It began to elongate as if it were a cell dividing. Then just as suddenly as it began the process.  The star split into two individual stars.   At that time many other stars about 10 began to go through the same process.  I ran inside and got the D.I. on duty at the time.  He came out and watched it also.  Previous to him coming out I called it to the attention of everyone in the circle.   Then suddenly it stopped and all the stars that had morphed into two stars stayed and the whole event stopped.;28.9039760000001;-81.2385859999997
