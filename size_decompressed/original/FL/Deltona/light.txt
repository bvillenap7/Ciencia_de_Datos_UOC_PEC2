large light travels very fast across sky.;2005-06-15 23:50:00;4 seconds;large light travels very fast across sky. while out on my nightly walk I observed a large light go almost from horizon to horizon in about four seconds.There are two major airports in the area and I'm familiar with what planes and their lights look like. The light was as large as a 747 , round in shape.  There was complete cloud cover at the time. According to the weather channel there was a 10,000 foot ceiling. No stars were visible. The light had to be under the cloud cover to be seen and could not be confused with a meteor.Also there was no sound of any type. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.

I had just stepped outside to walk my dog and noticed that it was a little cloudy.  Then, I  immediately saw a bight light in the clouds from the corner of my eye.  It started from my left and went to my right. At first I thought it might be a shooting star, but then I realized that it was waaaay too big to be a shooting star.  Another think I realized was that too low to be a shooting star.  It was so bright that I saw it shining IN the clouds.  It was very fast, but didn’t make a noise and didn’t fizzle out as a shooting star would.  It wemt all the way until it disappeared into the horizon and I couldn’t see it anymore.;28.9039760000001;-81.2385859999997
