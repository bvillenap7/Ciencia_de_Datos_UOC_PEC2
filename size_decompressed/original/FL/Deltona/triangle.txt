Triangular shaped object, with a rounded back that can hove with little to no sound, and two very bright lights, and more on the side.;2011-12-16 21:40:00;unknown;Triangular shaped object, with a rounded back that can hove with little to no sound, and two very bright lights, and more on the side. I was driving home from work, coming over the border line for Seminole County into Volusia, when I saw these two bright lights hanging over the interstate.  I saw that, after a while, the aircraft was not moving, so I assumed it was a helicopter.   I rolled down my windows and turned off my stereo, but didn’t hear the sound from a helicopter’s propellers.  My sunroof was open, and as I drove under it, I saw that it was a full aircraft, hovering with either little to no sound, with a rounded back, and lights on the sides.   I drove a bit further, and saw two more bright lights in the distance.  I went to see if I could drive under the second aircraft as it was also at a standstill, but it flew away before I could get a closer look at it.  That happened only a couple minutes after I saw the first air craft. ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the sighting occurred on Friday, December 16, and we have altered the date above, to reflect that fact.

I seen an object in the sky triangular in shape, with a light on each corner, and an orb like light in the center which appeared to be glowing from the top as well as the bottom.  It was flying approximately 100 feet from the ground and was flying very slow as I passed underneath it.  When I realized it was not a plane or helicopter I took out my phone and as soon as I pressed record the flying object sped up and left the area.;28.9039760000001;-81.2385859999997
