Grey chevron tracked east to west over Deltona, Fl.;2016-08-12 04:15:00;30 seconds;Grey chevron tracked east to west over Deltona, Fl. While out watching for meteors, around  4 am facing east, a faint grey/smoky chevron slowly and silently, tracked across the sky from east towest in a straight path.  Holding my hand up at arm's length, the object was about the size of my thumb.  There were no lights emanating from this object.;28.9039760000001;-81.2385859999997
