Spherical object hovers 20 feet above road;2009-01-23 00:55:00;10seconds;Spherical object hovers 20 feet above road I observed a spherical object hovering 20 feet above the road and drove directly under the object(no sound). I viewed the object while driving about 40 mph and viewed it for  about 10 seconds from first sighting it, to passing under it. The object had no lights and was the size of a basketball. Curiously the street lights had been out. The object was not difficult to see since my headlights illuminated the area. The object (metallic) had a raised band around the middle and 3/4 of the way up it had what appeared to be a round port or eye. The object was positioned right near a power line that stretched  perpendicular to the road which was two lanes. This object seemed like some type of probe. This was kind of bone chilling when you see something that close! It is my opinion that an invasion is taking place. I have seen too many this past year, and continue to hear and read of many reports around the world. Coincidently, Florida, or at least my area, experiences a high number of power outages. One occurred in the State which made the news shortly after my sighting. It was reported as of unknown cause and was being investigated. My background is as follows. Served in the U.S. Air Force and hold an Aircraft Mechanic Certification. I have had many sightings occur since 1991. I made a report here once before from that year in Colorado. I see UFOâ€™s at least once every two months. My brother had a sighting shortly before I had mine. He is in Colorado and also served in the Air Force and made a report here.

Two round lights changed colors and moved at incredible rates of direction and speed.;2015-03-23 21:14:00;40 seconds;Two round lights changed colors and moved at incredible rates of direction and speed. There were two round lights, one green, one red.  Then both lights became green, 5 seconds later they both became red.  The lights were below the cloud cover at approximately 1000 ft.  The lights were stationary in the night sky.   As my traveling companion pulled the vehicle of the road to observe, the lights streaked north at an incredible rate of speed, dove 90 degrees and streaked north again out of sight.;28.9039760000001;-81.2385859999997
