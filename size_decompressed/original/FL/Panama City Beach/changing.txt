Bright, round to oblong object.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a planet in the eastern morning sky??  PD));2015-01-18 06:30:00;30 minutes;Bright, round to oblong object. At first thought it was a star but it was daylight, it went from round to oblong and bright white light shining from it from both sides when in would become oblong.  It stayed it same location for at least 30 mins without moving in any direction . When I come in the house to get my phone for video it was gone .  No where in sight . It would be very hard to explain this object.  Even if I had a photo or video it would be hard to figure out . I just feel very lucky to have seen this really cool thing .
