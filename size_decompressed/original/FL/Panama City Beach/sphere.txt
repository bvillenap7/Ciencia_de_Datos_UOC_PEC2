Recently we were evacuated to PC Beach, Fl.  Upon our stay we witnessed several unidentified crafts hoovering. They were too low to be stars, and too high to be boats. Similar to what I've read by others, they were symetric, metallic looking objects with a deep red eminating from the bottom, sometimes a bright green. They were observed for several nights, since our evacuation from Hurricane Katrina till we arrived home after about 5 months in a hotel. It was a nice hotel with an excellent view of the Gulf from the 6th floor, with a balcony. We have video footage of these objects which seemed to stay just out far enough not to be detected by the naked eye very well. Sometimes they would be in a formation of some sort, a W. At one point as we were all looking  at them from the balcony, one craft lit up, lights seemingly going around the vessel. That was the point that we knew it was something extraordinary. It was also where we could make out the metallic, grey look to the surface. Like two upside down plates, the lights emitted from the upper middle section of the phenomenea. A deep red or green light emitted from the mid-bottom. They hoovered mostly, sometimes moving, sometimes slowly from our vantage wiew, but had to be incredibly fast compared to seeing an aircraft passing by. I wondered why the Air Force weren't noticing this, since Tyndal Air Force base is located nearby.

PCB, FL. - Sighted one reddish/orange colored sphere/75-100 ft. high/100yds. from coast/travelling west to east.;2012-11-24 22:00:00;30-45 seconds;PCB, FL. - Sighted  one reddish / orange colored sphere /  75-100 ft. high / 100yds. from coast / travelling west to east Me and a friend had went to PCB for the weeekend 0f 11/23-11/25 for a much needed break since I have been confined to a wheelchair for the last four months due to a injury to my leg and several months to go.  On saturday night(11/24) we were back in our unit at the resort. I had been out on the balcony shooting some video of the beach and enjoyimg the cold evening. At appro. 22:00 hrs., I was getting cold and my video recorder was out of battery.  I proceeded to go in our room.I opened the door and backed my wheelchair into the room. After I was in the room still sitting in my wheelchair with the balcony door open I had turned my head to the side talking to my friend.  When I turned my head back to look out to the balcony,thats when I seen one reddish/orange colored sphere.My first thought was someone is shooting fireworks.  I quickly decided,no sparks, no hissing,not fireworks. It looked to be traveling west to east, moving at a steady speed.  Looked like it had one red light in the center of it and a halow or glow from the center light surrounding it.  It appeared not to be real far from the coastline.(appr.100yds.)  I would say the height could not have been no more than (75-100 ft.) for the fact I was backed up in the room (3rd. floor)ten feet or so from the balcony,still in my chair.  There was no sound what so ever that I could hear coming from it. I hollowed to my friend to get the camcorder and come look at this.  I grabbed the camcorder hit the power on and it done nothing.Figuring the battery was gone, grabbed my cell phone, Took a quick picture while hitting the power button again on the camcorder.  I seen the camcorder powering up, so I quickly closed my cell (forgetting to save the picture) trying to get some video as I seen the glow was fading as it looked to be going out in the gulf.End result, no picture, no video. I do not know for sure if it made a rt.turn while moving from west to east to head out in the gulf,or maybe it traveled more from northwest to southeast. Never seen anything like this before.  I estimate from first sighting, to watching it fade away, as it headed out sea, was (30-45) seconds.;30.2406142857143;-85.8471285714286
Orange spheres over Panama City Beach Florida.;2014-07-04 20:30:00;1.5 hours;Orange spheres over Panama City Beach Florida 	On July 4th, 2014, at approximately 8:30 pm, I witnessed a ufo fly over me.  I was standing on the beach between the Sandpiper Beacon Beach Resort located at 17403 Front Beach Road in Panama City Beach, Fl. 32413 and Landmark Holiday Beach Resort 17501 Front Beach Rd, Panama City Bch, FL 32413.  	 I was facing the gulf (south) watching fireworks that were on both sides of me.  I was watching the ones to the left of me when a friend said look at that.  I turned to my right and saw a ufo approximately 20 feet in diameter, spherical, glowing orange, the outside surface texture was not frozen solid, but had small waves on it.  However it was not transparent.  It was traveling from west to east.  The ufo was between me and Emerald Isle Beach Resort (Emerald Isle Resort stands 23 stories tall) when I first saw it.   I judged its size and speed (about 60 mph) against the Emerald Isle Resort and Landmark Holiday Beach Resort, and Sandpiper Beacon Beach Resort.   I saw it large for about 3 seconds, (from the Emerald Isle Resort  and Sandpiper Beacon Beach Resort.) then in about one second it traveled about 2 miles east to around pier park (approximately 7,200 mph) and stopped.  It seemed to go straight along the coastline. 	After that initial sighting, there were multiple lights in the sky (not from the fireworks).  The spherical lights were orange and red.  They would sometimes fly in formation, and other times go away or towards each other.  There is no way they can be lanterns or airplanes.  They moved to fast and quickly went in opposite directions.;30.2406142857143;-85.8471285714286

Steady motion forward, then skipped forward a little distance (too fast to see) and carried on moving as before, then it stopped in the air and turned toward the sea on its axis.   After a while it moved toward the sea at the same slow speed.   Then disappeared.;30.2406142857143;-85.8471285714286

Orange ball of light, separated into two balls then appeared as one again farther to the East. ((anonymous report));2019-10-07 19:15:00;40 minutes;Orange ball of light, separated into two balls then appeared as one again farther to the East. One orange sphere hovering in night sky turned bright then completely turned off.  It appeared 5 min later then separated slowly into a second sphere.  10 min later one appeared again to the East, 10 min after that it appeared for a third time.  Always hovering in the same equilateral line.   We called the Coast Guard, they said there had been multiple calls about the objects and that the Air Force was training.  Very peculiar, what air craft flies with its lights off at night and becomes a giant beam then disappears?;30.2406142857143;-85.8471285714286
