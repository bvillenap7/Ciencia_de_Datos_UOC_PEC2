Massive lighted kites on Florida beach front, initially mistaken for UFO's.  ((NUFORC Note:  Apparently kites, not UFOs.  PD));2016-07-28 22:00:00;10 minutes;Massive lighted kites on Florida beach front, initially mistaken for UFO's Amazing lighted kites on the beach caused me 2-3 minutes of excitement.  They were very high and as they were brought closer to our rental unit we realized they were very large kites.  They could have easily been mistaken for a pair of UFO's.  I have video and photos.
