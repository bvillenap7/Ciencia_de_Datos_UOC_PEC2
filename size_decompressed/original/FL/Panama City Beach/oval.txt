Red light, from 0 to ? in seconds. Over Panama City Beach, Florida;2008-04-19 08:00:00;1 minute;Red light, from 0 to ? in seconds. Over Panama City Beach, Florida My wife and I were going to Carabba's to eat dinner, traveling West we saw a red oval shaped object just kind of sitting there in the sky. I thought it might be a planet or something the way it just sat there. It was the coolest thing I can remember ever seeing, because like a bolt of lightening it took off sideways then straight up. I've seen jets kick their afterburners in before but this was nothing like that, the speed that this moved from sitting still gives me chills today. Even the new planes that they have at Tyndall AFB would not be able to touch this, it would be like trying to catch a Porche on a Tricycle.
