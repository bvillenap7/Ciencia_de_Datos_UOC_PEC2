: Panama City Beach FL Back Beach Road;1998-06-04 22:30:00;10-15 Minutes;: Panama City Beach FL Back Beach Road During the first week of June in 1998 , exact day/date I can not remember , I was driving West on Back Beach Rd. ( Hwy 98 ) , I pulled over at the cable company by the big Christian Church . It was about 10:30 p.m. I noticed something moving towards the East in the sky .  I thought with tourist season in effect that it was a helicoptor but it was strange to see one at night and at back beach road . As it got closer , I noticed it was not a helicoptor , I had no clue what it was . It was dark in color , almost transparent with the exception of 3 reddish lights , one on each corner but very dim . It was about 100-150 feet above the ground , and not a sound what so ever . Several vehicles pulled over to witness this , I had a disposible camera and took the whole roll full of pictures , but all I got was black pictures back when they were developed . No TV news reported it , I called the police and was told several calls had come in but no one knew what this was . To this day it still baffles me . This thing was huge .;30.2406142857143;-85.8471285714286
Triangular vehicle seen over ocean in Florida.;1999-05-20 23:00:00;seconds;Triangular vehicle seen over ocean in Florida. The object was seen from an eighth floor south facing balcony on the beach of Panama City Florida. The building was directly next to a state park at the end of a little peninsula separating the bay from the canal. It was dark on the balcony and dark outside.  It was approximately 11pm.  The two observers had been sitting for about 45 minutes watching the sky as they talked.  Suddenly one observer saw what she believed was a plane until she noticed that it was not.  The object was flying south toward the ocean gulf and was going slow enough and low for her to briefly glimpse a triangular flying object with no lights on it.  The only source of light was coming from the back end:  a tail of orange/red emissions that decreased in size as it left the back of the vehicle Think golf tee.  Its emissions gave enough light to show the contours of the bottom side of the vehicle.  The bottom revealed a scalloped like design, much like the old corrugated roofs.  By the time the observer had registered this information and realized it could not be a plane (it was too close and did not look like one), it and its plume shot quickly away with no sound, then disappeared. The second observer saw a light out of the corner of his eye and turned in time to see a flash and then nothing.;30.2406142857143;-85.8471285714286

I noticed a large object with neon or laser like lights flying from over the condo towards the ocean.  It stopped a ways over the ocean.   The lights changed colors and l noticed about all the colors of the spectrum.   I grabbed my phone and took pictures, then video'd the object.  The object continued to hover silently in one place.   The object began appearing and disappearing, finally disappearing with one beam of purple light coming down from the clouds.;30.2406142857143;-85.8471285714286
