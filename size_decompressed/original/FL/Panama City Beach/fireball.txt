Very bright fireball that seemed to change colors and go out and relight.;2013-05-26 22:00:00;90 seconds;very bright fireball that seemed to change colors and go out and relight. On the night of May 26 2013 around 10 pm central time I was standing outside with a group of friends when I Saw a very large glowing light over the gulf just off Panama City Beach Florida traveling from north west to south east.  As I watched it I noticed it was headed in a downward motion at a high rate of speed.   Knowing there is a airport at the navy base it is not unusual to see planes and helicopters in the area.  The more I watched it the more it seemed to look like a fire ball than a plane or helicopter.   After about 30 to 45 seconds all at once it seemed as though a fire just went out then all at one time it flickered becoming as bright as when I first noticed it.  That is when I was sure it was not a plane unless it was crashing so I got everyone outside to look, we watched for about another 30 seconds until it disappeared behind the large hotels and trees blocking our view.   None of us could really agree on what it was I say it was a meteorite others say it was a plane crashing.    The two things we all could agree on is that it was not a plane or helicopter unless it was crashing the other was there is no airport in the direction it went down only water.;30.2406142857143;-85.8471285714286
Four glowing orange orbs were seen over the Gulf of Mexico in Panama City Beach, FL.;2013-11-05 21:30:00;10 minutes;Four glowing orange orbs were seen over the Gulf of Mexico in Panama City Beach, FL. We're on vacation and had just got back from dinner.  We're staying on the eastern beaches near St. Andrews Park.  I saw an orange glowing object through the balcony door and got up to go see what it was (we're on the 22nd floor, so it was odd to see something that high up).  We saw three orange glowing balls of fiery light over the Gulf waters.   One was traveling West to East.  Another was traveling East to West above the first one.  A third was traveling just above the surface of the water East to West.  The first two vanished, leaving only the third one.  The third one began to climb upward in a slow arc.  It stopped and hovered for a moment and seemed to change colors to a more star like white color.  It rapidly accelerated away from us and disappeared into a pinpoint of light.   As we were reeling and trying to come to grips with what we had just seen, a fourth glowing orange orb appeared miles away and far off in the distance down on the Western end of! the beach, which would be Front Beach.  We looked at it through the binoculars and saw that it's fiery orange glow was reflected in the water below it.  As we watched, the fourth one slowly disappeared into the distance and was gone.
