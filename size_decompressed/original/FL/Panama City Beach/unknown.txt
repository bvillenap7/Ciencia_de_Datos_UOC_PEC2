A sequence of golden lights;2006-05-02 21:00:00;2 minutes;A sequence of golden lights I saw very large amber colored lights light up over the gulf.  There were two lit then two next to those lit then it did it again.  Looked like 4 large gold colored lights.   Then it completely dissapeared in the night sky, or the lights went out.   I saw it two more times then I saw several aircraft immediately in the area.  I did not see the planes but I could hear them and dee the red light on the back of them blinking.  It was weird.   I have never seen anything like it.   The object was in the sw close to the beach appearing just between the horizon and below a satelitte to the left of the moon. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and she seemed to us to be quite sincere, and credible.  We suspect that flares of some sort would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that she had been looking at genuine UFO's, but that is just a guess.  PD));30.2406142857143;-85.8471285714286
alot light flashing red white and blue over panama city beach;2006-07-12 21:00:00;about 5 hours;alot light flashing red white and blue over panama city beach I was sitting on The back Porch(10th floor)of the Summit Hotel in Panama city beach With a beautiful view of the beach. I Was on Vacation at panama city beach with my Girlfriend,Dad, and Sister. As i was looking in the sky with my Girlfriend on The back porch I noticed a Flashing light in the Sky out toward sea that was flashing red,white, and blue. I told my Girlfriendhey look up in the sky right their as she did she gave me a look like is that what i think it is. Then i told my father(a little inebreated)look at that in the sky flashing. He looked into the sky and said oh that's probably a meteor Andrew( the ship was going down). Then the ship started to move up in the air and he said now it's moving up. He continued to say their was a air base near by and it was probably a plane. About 10 minutes later after seing the Ship move left to right and up and down he agreed that this was no man made craft unless it was top of the line secret projects. Not to long from then we noticed more space craft in the area spread all over. In all i saw about 9 Ship's at one time over the beach. Some were alone and others at a glips you could mistake for a constelation because of their grouping. The next day At about 9:30 pm we all went outside ( including my sister)to look to see if the Ship's were still their. Sure enough their was all the same events taking place. This continued every night until We left from our Vacation on july the 16th. One night my Girlfriend went to bed early so I went Outside because of my curiousity of these ship's. I thought to my self they have to leave at some point, so i decided to stay outside until then. I was outside for about 3 Hours and I noticed that less and less were outside(1:30 am) so i kept my eye one until about 2:00 am and it started to get less visible because it was moving back I guess. Eventually I could barely see the Ship and it shot up into the air at a 90 degree angle and then at a 45 degree angle out into space at what i assume was at the speed of ! light. T his is all the information i have. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));30.2406142857143;-85.8471285714286
Lighted object moving in unusual patterns, unlike any aircraft.;2012-03-08 22:18:00;continues;Lighted object moving in unusual patterns, unlike any aircraft. When first observed the sky was crystal clear.  This lighted object moves erratically in every direction sometimes in a straight line other times rather pendulously, appears to sit relatively still then will dart or make slight movements.  Initially thought it was an airplane as we are near an international airport as well as 2 Air Force Bases and a Navy Base.  It can be obscured by clouds so it does not appear to be reflective such as a laser light.   As we were looking at the lighted object 2 other people from the community walked by.  I asked if they would look at the light in the sky and tell me what they observe, they described exactly what we had.  It is currently 11:47 p.m. and the sky is becoming hazy but the object continues its behavior. My daughter has observed a similar appearance more than once.  One time she observed 2 objects very near one another.;30.2406142857143;-85.8471285714286
