Unusual Military Movements Off of Western Shore of Shell Island Panama City Beach;2000-10-26 13:48:00;45 seconds;Unusual Military Movements Off of Western Shore of Shell Island Panama City Beach Daylight sighting from beach, clear day temps in 80s. I was staying on Panama City Beach (Baltimore Beach facing west) very near to St.Andrews (Shell Island) Park enterence. Being a former member of my local MUFON I was keeping a eye open during my stay in PCB, but didn't see anything of interest except for some very strange Military activity. The Beach was buzzed by F-18s each day during my stay at odd hours. This day though while on the beach with two other friends, I was watch- ing strange boat activity on the horizen. Just as one F-18 buzzed the beach with a over head flight, I was observing one of the military craft on the horizen (to the South-West). I wittnessed something launch ed from the boat that skimmed the water heading directly south from the craft with a flight duration of 45 seconds to one minute before splash down and then the F-18 left the beach as if its engine was used to mask the sound of the launch. I was using 10 by 25 fully coated opitics to watch the sight. At first I dismissed the sighting as military training being that there are several bases in the area, and you have to train somewhere after all. But with the f-18s buzzing the beach every day and the recent mass beaching of deep sea sharks on the eastern shore of Shell Island (Oct 18-22,2000). I felt that this sighting should be reported to some one.;30.2406142857143;-85.8471285714286
V-shape, HUGE, no lights, no sound.;2014-08-31 23:50:00;20 minutes;V shape, HUGE, no lights, no sound 2 of us sat on beach and saw V shaped craft come due north at us from out in the gulf.  Glided over beach into large cloud. 10 mins later saw it again come from behind us and heading due south toward us again.  Glided over beach, turned east in the blink of an eye, and headed down the beach line.   Dull dark grey in colour.  No lights. No windows. Pointed at the front but flat at the 2 back ends.  Very skinny with lines across it, like it was made of sectional squares.  No noise.  No wind displacement.  Absolutely huge. 1/4 mile from us and must have been 300ft across at the back.  Speed was about 40mph.;30.2406142857143;-85.8471285714286
TR-3B anti-gravity spacecraft or UFO Panama City Beach Florida 30 April, 2019.;2019-04-30 14:00:00;3 hours;I was in a hotel room on the 22nd floor in Panama City Beach Florida.  I was looking off the balcony west to east towards Tyndall AFB when I spotted what I thought was the reflection of something in the air.  I estimated it to be approximately 15 miles away and approximately 20,000 feet AGL.  I realized the object I was seeing was not moving. I have 22 years in the us air force, and have over 2000 hours flying on helicopters, so I initially thought I was seeing something hoovering, and possibly something from the nearby Tyndall AFB.  I began taking photos of it and a short video.  The pictures are a sequential series of about 100 photos and show the object to have a lot of movement but it is not going anywhere.  I used a zoom lens on a new a6000 sony and did not check the photos at the time.  Later when I downloaded them to my laptop I realized I had captured some very extraordinary pictures of something I had never seen before.  Over the course of the two hours I t! ook photos the object appears to be an advanced aircraft with straight lines and horizontal stabilizers, to a rocket shaped object traveling at a very high speed, what appears to be concentric rings of a contrail, and finally what appears to be a huge luminescent stingray or butterfly with straight line edged wings on both sides. In another series of photos it is obvious the object has made itself to appear invisible by reflecting the surrounding blue sky. I have not posted any of these photos yet. I know this all sounds crazy, but I have actual photos of everything I have mentioned. I have uploaded the video to youtube and can be seen there.  The single video is broken into four parts so it can be seen at normal speed and then slowed down and looked at frame by frame. One of the four parts can be found on youtube under the title of:  TR-3B anti-gravity spacecraft or UFO Panama City Beach Florida 30 April 2019 video 300 percent zoom;30.2406142857143;-85.8471285714286
