Both of us woke up with lost time but what we recal are identical.;2013-11-29 04:45:00;3 hours;both of us woke up with lost time but what we recal are identical. my wife and I were at Thanksgiving dinner with family.  We both remember entering the house but the next thing we were waking up at 445am on the floor laying next to each other.  my wife remembers trying to move and could not, and calling my name to come help her and be with her in the black dark room.  I could see her being held down by a force like a blanket and trying to get to her.  The room I saw was black on the floor but really bright white above and when you tried to look at anyone in the room a brighter flash would be in your face to cover them up.  A beam like a laser ray would scan up and down my body, they were highly pissed they could not identify us together and kept asking me why we were together and our purpose together.  I kept showing identification but they didn't care they wanted proof we were together. Finally I showed them my debit card and said scan this to see both of our names are on the account, you can then see we are together.  Fi! nally they allowed me to go to her and when I reached for her that's when we both woke up on the floor.  she heard me yelling at them and that I showed my debit card and kept saying...scan this scan this...  my debit card was OUT of my wallet which was other side of room and was on top of my wallet.?  the only card out.  we both are still shaking from this.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
Two orange glowing objects that appeared to be like balloons people ride in with fire in the baskets.;2014-07-04 21:00:00;3 minutes;Two orange glowing objects that appeared to be like balloons people ride in with fire in the baskets. The objects came from nw direction over trees and changed to east direction, first one then the other.  My sister thought they were balLoons, the type of balloons that people take rides in as they were rounded and glowing orange at the top and appeared to have yellow/orange flames beneath them and rising up thru them kind of whispy like.  Beautiful. I called my neighbors out and they saw the second object as it came over the trees and their house.  They then disappeared in the east, possibly No. Fort Myers.  A short while later I called my neighbors out again as I saw 2 orange lights in the east, one directly above the other, then another appeared and then another.  We watched them for a while and they disappeared, then we saw 2 of them to the north of us.   I later saw 1 of them in the sea, which went out of sight after a few minutes.  I gave up watching and went into my home and out to the ((name deleted)) which faces south and saw 2 of them coming from the sw and then they disap! peared from sight.   I did not have the cell phone with me when they were so close and missed a great picture for you.  I went into the house to get it but none of them came close enough after that.  The time is approximate.  There was no sound from the objects.   On another occasion, November 19, 2013, my sister and I left our house (faces north), I looked up and I saw a very bright white light slightly nw and in front of us, it started to blink..then another bright light came on slightly ne and it started to blink then another in the center (but in front of the others forming a triangle) came on and started to blink.  All three blinked together for a few seconds then they all went out at the same time.  IT was huge as at my level there is about 160 feet of land between two of the lights.  I hate to lump this together but there is one other occasion.  I can't recall the date but one evening coming home on Gator Circle I saw something odd in the sky.  I turned south at ne 13th ave and s! topped to ask 2 girls if they needed help as they were parked with no lights on..they said no, we're taking pictures.   I turned my car around and saw in the north 3 red lights on what must have been a huge object and then saw the object I had just seen and another go into that dark area.  I said, look, theres two of them and they said ...there were six.  The huge object then very slowly turned to the north, started moving in that direction then just disappeared in the distance.  I asked the girls if they had pictures, they said yes but they weren't very good.  Then we left the area.  I lumped this for your info as I hadn't made reports on these.  Your welcome to separate them and use the info on tonights incredible sighting.. they were just beautiful.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693

Trio of vertical bars of light close together;2016-04-05 23:30:00;1 minute;Trio of vertical bars of light close together I saw what appeared to be a trio of vertical bars of bronze-white light, rectangular in shape and very close together.   They shone for only about a minute in total but my mother noticed them as well and she couldn’t figure out what it was either.   I’ve never seen anything remotely like it before now and I’ve been living in this area for many years.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693

Two of us by the pool.  Talking about the divine way in which we met!  When instantly something appears far out and slowly shoots.;2017-04-26 02:00:00;1 minute;Two of us sitting by the pool.  Talking about the divine way in which we met!  When instantly, something appears far out and slowly shoots across the sky!  It was about 2:12 AM..   It didn't go up or down, it shot straight over head.  But at a slow enough pace to see for a moment!  It was huge!  Unlike nothing ever seen b4!  It had 5 circle bright white lights in the front!  They were perfect white.  One cirlce in the middle and 4 around it.  Then a blue thin layer behind with what followed was a stream of orange light that was together at the end.   So it starts as a circle of lights, followed by an orange tail that pointed.  All together like an ice cream cone shape!  Silent!  It was beautiful and gave a warm fuzzy feeling!   I instantly heard the verse, and the holy Spirit descended upon them and said, this is my son with whom I am well pleased !!  I haven't found it elsewhere online.  Also a piece appeared to break off and for a sec there was two of it!  Amazing!  Usually, I feel fear when I've seen the weird stuff in the sky.  Not this one!  Plus the wierd trumpet noises I heard the next day... Doesn't take a genius!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous provides no contact information.
