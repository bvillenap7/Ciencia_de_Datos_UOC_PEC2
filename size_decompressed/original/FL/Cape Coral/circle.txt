I saw a bright star like light moving around thousands of feet in mere seconds;2002-07-10 23:00:00;10 seconds;I saw a bright star like light moving around thousands of feet in mere seconds it looked as if it were just a bright star in the northeast sky at first. But then suddenly descended like nothing i have ever seen. Way faster than anything freefalling or at meteor speed. This was moving thousands of feet in mere seconds.  When it moved it had no tail, like meteors are known to have ruling that out.  Besides that, after the initial descent it stopped and moved back up just as fast. after that it moved back down again and then at a medium rate, faded away into nothing. this could not have been anything natural and our government definetly  could not produce something of this speed and manuverability.

second (more recent) sighting of bright star like object moving at impossible speed;2003-12-26 21:31:00;2 seconds;second (more recent) sighting of bright star like object moving at impossible speed This sighting I recently had happended in the exact same spot of the sky where I had my first sighting. Except this time the object looked a lot closer because it was a slighty bigger and brighter star like light. There was also a plane I could see in the same veiw when it happened this time. And instead of manuvering, the object  just flew straight down thousands of feet to the ground (past the treeline at least) at a rate of speed no jet or meteor could go. this looked to be more than 100 miles away so I wasnt so tempted to drive over to the possible landing area. But Im sure it was the same object I saw more than a year ago in the northeast sky.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
Bluish circle moved quickly across the sky and dsappeared;2008-09-28 22:30:00;>5 seconds;Bluish circle moved quickly across the sky and dsappeared Facing east, I noticed a blue circle with white around the outside of it and a blue/white tail behind it. It was very low in the sky and kind of looked like the ball out of a roman candle. However, it moved from north to south across the eastern sky fairly low and there were no other ones before or after it appeared. There was no sound associated with it and it quickly disappeared with no visible smoke or anything left behind leading me to think it was not any type of firework. It was also too low in the sky to be  shooting star.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693

It was up to high to be a helicopter and it had no wings or vapor trail to be a plane, and to be moving horizontally and vertically disappear is unexplainable.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
2 shiny flying objects flying over cape coral/ft myers area;2009-11-22 18:00:00;10 mins;2 shiny flying objects flying over cape coral/ft myers area My son and i where out riding in my jeep through our housing plan in NE cape coral and i looked up to the sky and noticed 2 shiny metalic shaped sausers flying side by side. they were so close to one another it looked like they where touching. they were not moving at all for like 2- 3 mins then the one craft started moving forward accross the sky and the other one was moving much slower and then real quick it caught up to it. We watched it for like 5-10 mins just flying straight in the sky then they flew into the clouds and then they were gone. But the sunset was orangest pink and it was reflecting off them.

Large red and pulsing circle of light heading north at varying speeds in Southwest Florida.;2014-04-27 20:45:00;<1 minute;Large red and pulsing circle of light heading north at varying speeds in Southwest Florida My husband and I were having a cigarette on the back lanai at about 8:45pm when a bright red circle of light appeared in the sky south of us.  The light was too bright to belong to a plane, and was pulsing, rather than blinking, never going completely out.  It appeared to be very large, or somewhat close.  At first it moved slowly, heading north, then it almost seemed to shoot forward, or skip, for a moment before slowing down again.  My husband used his cell phone to shoot video of it until we lost view of it over the house.  I ran through the house and out the front door to see if I could follow it or find it again, but it was nowhere to be seen.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
White ball outlined with what appeared to be fire.;2014-06-21 21:50:00;5-8 minutes;white ball outlined with what appeared to be fire. It was a bright white ball that appeared to have been outlined with almost a burning fire look to it.  It wasn't very close but it also wasn't very far away, we could see objects that would have been farther behind it, like telephone poles and such.   The object was low in the sky, appeared to be coming right towards us and we thought it was a plane on fire about to crash until it began to rise straight up.   It was a very clear night, not a cloud in the sky.  The light from the object did not go out, we were able to watch it go all the way up into the sky as far as the eye could see and then it got too far up and was no longer visible.

7-8 orange circles with a red light on bottom.;2015-02-08 19:00:00;5-6 minutes;7-8 orange circles with a red light on bottom. Saw between 7-8 orange circles (with a red light underneath) in the sky.  At first they were flying in formation with a lot of space in between them - 2X2.  The last circle was solo.  The sky was clear except for stars.  No noise heard.   They came out of the west and headed east.  Eventually they all went behind clouds.   Six of us saw it.  Took a photo.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
Red/Orange Orb seen in N/W Cape Coral on 3/10/15 that passed close to 2 aircraft.;2015-03-10 22:57:00;2 minutes;Red/Orange Orb seen in N/W Cape Coral on 3/10/15 that passed close to 2 aircraft. Sitting out back in our pool cage that faces west we noticed a very bright Orange/Red round Orb was seen moving from south to north and going along the coast of Pine Island Sound.   There were two aircraft on final approach to SW FL International Airport that were headed SW, coming from the north along the gulf coast.  The orb flew past them quite close and was at about the same altitude as the planes.  When it went past the second plane the orb lowered its altitude from buzzing the first plane, which was at a bit higher altitude.   The orb then circled to the west and headed over Pine Island at about a 45 degree angle up and disappeared into some clouds.  The speed of the orb was about two to three times that of the commercial aircraft.  There were 3 of us that watched it and besides wondering what it was, we were wondering what was being said in the cockpits of the aircraftâ€¦  I tried to take a video, but the batteries were too low on my camera to use it.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693

It was a cloudy night and we were not able to see any clear details, only a glow.   We heard a humming sound, but we are not sure if that could have been from some other planes that could have been in the area, it was a cloudy night and visibility was low.   The ball/circle of light then went behind some low clouds and stopped for about 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Then it started traveling East.  It bounced around in the sky, kind of like when someone plays with a Spin Top, we thought the reason for this was because the clouds were distorting our view.   The light then dimmed out and faded away.  We looked online for any other sightings of this light and did not find any.  There was a smaller plane that was flying close to the ball of light that was traveling in a N/NW direction.  We did notice that for the past few years there have been a number of sightings in this same area.  We were not able to take a pic or video, but the pics and videos of people that have did record past events had taken pictures of lights that were similar to the one we noticed during our event.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
Two glowing white orbs chasing each other - traveling from North to South - Cape Coral Fl;2015-10-15 05:20:00;2 minutes;two glowing white orbs chasing each other - traveling from North to South - Cape Coral Fl I take my dogs out every morning between 5:15 and 5:30 am and while they do their thing, I look up at the stars.  I often see meteors and even the ISS and satellites a few times.   This morning I looked up and coming from north I see two big glowing whitish orbs hauling it through the sky heading south, then they even seemed to be racing each other, with one getting ahead of the other and so on, this went on as they passed over me, a hair east of the big dipper, and kept going south until they were out of my view.  They were very, very high and going way too fast.  I have no idea what it was, so I found this site in hopes that someone saw the same event.  I was terrified but I don't know why, it was amazing.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693

Turning colors while coming down.  One is off to the left and much higher and farther away.  I have 20 minutes of video of the closest craft.  I see them every night.  And in video u can rely see the color changing and slow movement, almost like they communicate with each other by lights.  Love to know what they are.

Round glowing, or molten, orange object.;2017-10-10 22:10:00;5 minutes;round glowing or molten orange object. Round, glowing or molten orange object traveling east to west, about 20 feet above the canal and following the canal. No noise.  Object appeared to be glowing or molten and appeared to be cylindrical or oval shaped.  As it moved away it appeared to be round.  Passed about 60 feet in front of us.  Continued following the canal until the end of the canal, which is about .25 miles from where we were standing.  Then it appeared to gain elevation and then continue on.  At this point we could barely see it, and eventually lost sight of it.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
