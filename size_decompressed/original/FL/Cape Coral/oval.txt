I ran inside and by the time I got back out with other family members-it was gone.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693

It hovered about an eyeshot away and just hovered for 3 hrs. Flashing blue green and red simulataneously it caught all 3 of our eyes. It was as if it was them watching us not the other way around.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
Looking up the night was cloudy when I saw a light blue circular object with a long tail and a shorter stretch in the front.;2018-10-12 02:55:00;6-8 seconds;Looking up the night was cloudy when I saw a light blue circular object with a long tail and a shorter stretch in the front. UFO over South West Florida?  @ 2:55am EST On October 12, 2018,  I observed a flying object, light blue in color encompassed in a halo roughly a quarter of the size as the object but the color was a light blue but almost white in appearance.  It was headed 60 degrees NE “rapidly”.  Bright enough where I could feel my pupils dilate like a bright flash hit my eyes.  The weirdest thing is that the object just didn’t seem bright enough to cause the effect it had on my eyes. Whatever it was, the object was muffled by the cloudy overcast night.  The object seemed to be circular in shape with a equally sized tail.  The front portion had a glow about half the size as the tail, shaped the same way as the tail yet, not as bright. The object faded in and I observed it for approximately 6-8 seconds when it just as quietly and quickly as it appeared, it slowly faded out.  I desperately looked for a continuation of the sighting however, watching the path I observed it in, it never reappeared, not a glow or anything. ((name deleted));26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
