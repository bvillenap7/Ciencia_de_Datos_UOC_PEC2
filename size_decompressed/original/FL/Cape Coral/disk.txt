It was like I did not have a choice I felt under there control.  I live on a golf course and the area which they lead me to was a distance away form my house. It was on the 5th hole of the golf course when I got there, I did not know what was about to happen. It made a load beeping sound, I looked up and there was a small gray saucer no more then 30 to 40 yards up.  They could communicate with me in my head, but I did not see them just the space craft even when they left I could still here them talk to me.  They wanted me to go with them to there planet, I was scared and did not think that was a good idea.  They were pulling at me, it felt like hundred of hand grabbing at me. I knew I had  to get out of there I made my way to the road which was open, and I knew it would be hard for them to land.  As I was walking, it followed me step for step if I stopped, it stopped if I moved fast, it moved fast if I moved slow, it moved! slow. When it stated to move, it was at a horizontal position as it moved it  moved at a 45 degree angle. When I got to the road, it ascend very slowly till I lost it in the sky. After the attack, I got very sick I was bed rid for 3 days I did not eat, I did not drink, I did not use the bathroom, I was barely conscious I thought I was going to die! I could not even speak I was so weak. The reason  I am coming forward now is because one I did not think any one would belive me and two I am still having problems from the attack. I have had over 10,000 in medical testing done on me and all my tests have come back normal and none of the doctors still do not know what's wrong with me. I'm at the point where I don't know what to do can you help.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
Flying disk with red and blue lights/ disapeared in sky like a light balb went out;2012-01-19 20:45:00;4 mins;flying disk with red and blue lights/ disapeared in sky like a light balb went out Between 8:30- 9:00pm I was out on my back lania and look up in the sky (SE)to observe the stars and noticed a light in the sky that was not the same brightness as the stars.   It was the size of a star but dim and it was moving across the sky very slow,it was moving south.  It had as it apeared red and blue lights spining underneath the disk.  I watched it for about 4 to 5 minutes not taking my eyes off it and it just went out like a light bulb. GONE!;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
