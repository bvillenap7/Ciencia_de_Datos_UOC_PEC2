Super bright orangish red shooting flame across the sky in Cape Coral, FL;2012-11-07 21:00:00;15 seconds;Super bright orangish red shooting flame across the sky in Cape Coral, FL On November 7th, 2012, I was driving home from picking up my 14 year old son at a friend’s.  We were sitting at a light at Burnt Store and Pine Island Rd when we both looked up and saw what we thought was a shooting star.   I remember stating that it was the brightest shooting star I have ever seen.  It was so big and bright like it was SUPER close.  But the direction that it traveled was very odd it went in a 45 degree angle across the sky for a few seconds and then disappeared.  It was so strange that for the past week I have not been able to forget about it.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
Three fireballs sitting in a row hovering over us for 4 minutes Cape Coral, FL this evening.;2012-12-31 20:04:00;4 minutes;Three fireballs sitting in a row hovering over us for 4mins Cape Coral, FL this evening. December 31, 2012  8:04 p.m. I live in Cape Coral, just west of Pine Island (Gulf Waters).  My boyfriend and I are star gazers and enjoy the night sky.  I was in the house when suddenly he burst inside and yelled for me to come quick, I had to see something in the sky.  I stepped outside at 8:04 p.m. to view the night sky, which is very clear and filled with stars.  I looked up to where he was pointing and much to my surprise there were three fire ball orange/red blobs NOT STARS sitting spread out in a row just hovering above.  We watched for about two minutes as they just sat there.  From our home you can see planes flying in to Fort Myers Airport.  A plane was coming underneath and these things just sat there. After about a minute, one started to move and go North as if it were going to the ocean, soon after the other two moved in same direction following the first.  We stood and watched till we could not see them anymore. We were quite amazed with this sighting.  Definitely not stars, shooting stars, falling stars or any type of normal aircraft.  Tried to take picture with iphone but only shows image as white dots. Let me tell you I will be watching for these visitors to return on any given night...I have read alot of UFO sightings for Florida since I have been living here as of July, 2012. I came here from Northern California, Redwoods and Sonoma coast.  I have spent many evenings watching satellites cross the skies there and this was NOTHING as I have EVER seen. ???;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
Glowing orange orb over Southwest Florida;2013-10-26 21:36:00;2 minutes;Glowing orange orb over Southwest Florida I went outside to take my dog for a walk at approximately 9:36 p.m. As I returned up my driveway something in the sky caught my eye.  At first glance I thought it was a plane.  As I looked more carefully I became alarmed that it may have been on fire.  But I grew up watching planes, satellites, space stations, comets and this was nothing I have ever seen. It came from a Northerly direction in a steady, straight line and traveled toward the South. It was not particularly high but just below the small amount of cloud cover.  It was a large glowing orange orb. It was absolutely silent, no noise at all.  It was just this mass of blazing orange.  As it traveled past me I could almost discern a type of shape or structure to it.  The color then changed to a whiter glow  and it got very small then just disappeared.  Not like a plane diminishing on the horizon, it just blinked out.  Moments later a small aircraft headed over and I could clearly discern the blinking lights and engine drone.  It headed East toward a small airport but I feel it had no relation to what it was I saw.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
Witnessed and photographed a low flying fireball heading northward at 4 am that did not apppear like any fly object I ever saw.;2014-04-15 04:06:00;15 seconds;Witnessed and photographed a low flying fireball heading northward at 4 am that did not apppear like any fly object I ever saw. At approximately a few minutes after 4 am, my alarm sounded.  I awoke and went to the bathroom.  I decided to reset my alarm on my phone for an additional 15 mins of sleep.  As I was doing this standing next to my bed a bright light caught my attention out the window next to the bed.   I pulled the shade further aside to get a better view and was struck by the odd apparently flaming object at a seemingly low altitude traveling from the south heading basically northward.   Since I had my phone in my hand I quickly was able to turn on the camera and take 3 pictures.  The pictures are at quite a distance and the screen in the window added reticulation to the images but it is clear there are no red, green or landing lights like might be on a low flying plane (I work close to the regional airport and usually arrive at work in the dark and I am accustomed to what a plane leaving or arriving at a fairly low altitude looks like in many varying weather conditions) and it appeared elongated in the direction of travel and appeared to be emanating flames in all directions.   Though we were experiencing a lunar eclipse atthis same time, the moon was in another direction and there were only spotty clouds and none in the area of the sighted object.   Also no sound was noticed.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693

East Fort Myers sky from Cape Coral, thought it was part of the meteor shower, but it came in fast and dipped into the eastern horizon then re-appeared briefly shooting 1/3 of the way up from entry point, then very quickly as one orange globe still the same feel down again into the horizon, nothing like a meteor.   Anyone out there, we are seeing more of these, and we were not even looking, that is how bright it was and obscure.   This is our second sighting, last one the green fireball in Nov. 2016, witnessed from Ft Myers to E. Coast of Florida.  Very bright orange and no tail, which made it really surreal.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
A row of five or more balls of fire looking objects moving steadily towards the East in Cape Coral, Florida.;2018-03-05 19:48:00;3 minutes;A row of Five or more balls of fire looking objects moving steadily towards the East in Cape Coral, Florida. On March 5, 2018 at approximately 7:48 p.m. five or more bright reddish-orange lit moving objects (looked like fireballs), were quickly heading East through the sky visible from my front yard in Cape Coral, Florida.  As I face my house, they were fairly high in the sky and behind my home.  I ran next door and knocked on my neighbor’s door (no answer), then went into my house, unleashed my dog and grabbed my cell phone to take a photo.  By 7:51, they were almost entirely out of sight to the East.  My photo was nothing more than a tiny white speck by then.   At that point, a helicopter was in the spot where the UFOs had been.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
Green ball shooting through sky and illuminating clouds around it.;2018-11-14 20:38:00;2 seconds;Green ball shooting through sky and illuminating clouds around it. It was nighttime and I was in my car going 25 mph, when I saw a green streak of light shoot through the sky in SW Cape Coral.  It illuminated the clouds around it and it happened too fast for it to have been a drone, firework, or plane.  It couldn't have been a shooting star either as it was a bright circular green ball that was no higher than the mesosphere as it, once again, illuminated the clouds around it.  It did not leave a trail behind it.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
