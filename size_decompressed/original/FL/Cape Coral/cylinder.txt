Was this white cylinder with fins a weather balloon?;2007-04-29 15:30:00;30 mins;Was this white cylinder with fins a weather balloon? Traveling back home by car from Key West (towards Miami) my husband and I saw a strange object in the sky ahead of us. We calculated its size to be anything from 15 feet in length, in a horizontal position.  It looked cylindrical in shape, with 'fins' at one end. It was a bright white color - perhaps reflecting the sun, against a clear blue sky. We didn't see any lights on it. As we drove further along our route, towards the object, we could see that it seemed to be in a static position approximately 500-1000 ft up, directly above what looked like a radio tower. There was no sound or motion observed at all, and eventually we left it behind - above the 'radio tower'. We could not see any tether, but we are left wondering whether this could have been a simple weather balloon or similar man-made device? If so, others may have reported seeing this same object there in the past. Unfortunately, , being at the end of our holiday trip, we had no film left in the camera to photograph it.  Incidentally, we are both senior citizens, in good health both physically and mentally, and our backgrounds include the arts, sales/business, and health care/medicine. We are both still gainfully employed. We always try to keep an open mind about most things, and are particularly interested in health, nutrition, and holistic medicine.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693

Distinct white/silver metallic craft with discernable top and bottom flying across northern sky and disappeared.  No clouds in sky.;2014-07-18 18:45:00;2 minutes;Distinct white/silver metallic craft with discernable top and bottom flying across northern sky and disappeared.  No clouds in sky. Sitting on our lanai facing north.  Craft flew eastward very slowly at first.  We could see a solid structure or lip on the top of the craft, and at the bottom of the craft.  The center was either solid and reflecting the sun off a shiny metal surface or the center was without a solid shape and made of purely light/energy.   We viewed the craft flying eastward for approximately 30 seconds...  It sped up - probably double its original speed and it quickly disappeared.  Looked as if it had a screen raised over it which made it invisible. no sound. no trail behind it.   Sky was completely clear, no cloud cover.  About two hours before sunset.   We continued to study the sky for 15 to 20 minutes and it did not reappear, nor did we see it resume flying nearby.  Craft seemed to be approximately 1000 feet off the ground.   Vicinity has had several reports of missing and mutilated cats, reported in the news by our local police department, in the days prior to this event.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
