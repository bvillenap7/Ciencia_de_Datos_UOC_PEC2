Looking from our 5th. floor balcony we saw the playing cat and mouse for about 3 minutes.  One object would go up and down and left and right the other would follow.   As i got my camera, the silver object disappeared and the black object took off into the lightning cloud at a somewhat fast speed.   About 3 minutes later a airplane flew into that direction rather fast.   Daylight went away and noticed some more planes fly by.  There is an airport in fort myers (8 miles away );26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693

UFO's fly by festival in Cape Coral Florida on 11/10/2012;2012-11-14 17:30:00;5-10 minutes;UFO's fly by festival in Cape Coral Florida on 11/10/2012 There were about 17-20 orb shaped lights or giant glowing balls of light (hard to say how large since if they were 1/4 a mile away I would guess the size of a basketball. They may have been a few miles away then they would be the size of a car. They were in a group of four about 20ft apart then a few ain a row then another group. They had an orange glow and were organized as to how they maved across the sky. It took 5 to 10 minutes to complete.  We were at a festival that night and everyone that saw this was amazed.  There were thousands of people at the fair and with all the confusion of a fair people may have missed it but I'm pretty sure lots of the people saw this and just don't know how to report it.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
On Friday night, 3/15/13 at 8:34 pm I saw 6 round amber lights in the sky travelling slowly in a line-no sound-faded sequentially.;2013-03-15 20:34:00;4 minutes;On Friday night, 3/15/13 at 8:34 pm I saw 6 round amber lights in the sky travelling slowly in a line-no sound-faded sequentially. On Friday night, March 15, 2013 at about 8:34 p.m. I was driving down a street near my home travelling in an east to west direction.  I was alone in my vehicle.  I looked out of my driver’s side window and saw 6 round yellowish orange (amber) lights in the sky to my left.  Three of the lights were traveling in a straight line.  The other three lights were slightly behind the first three and were in a more irregular formation relatively close together.  The lights were travelling very slowly in the sky from west to east remaining in the same formation.  I pulled my vehicle over to the side of the road to observe this further as the color and number of lights struck me as being rather odd.  I lowered the driver’s side window to determine if there was any sound.  I did not hear a motor or sound of any type.  The lights appeared to be silently moving across the sky.  They were travelling high enough in the sky that I listened closely to ensure that they were not some sort of small aircrafts or helicopters.  However, they were not so high that they could have been any sort of large commercial aircraft.  At the time that I observed the 6 amber colored lights, I also observed that there appeared to be an aircraft much higher in the sky with the usual flashing white light that can be observed on a high flying aircraft.  What distinguished this single white light from the stars was the fact that it was blinking and moving in the sky.  It provided me with a source of comparison regarding how far up in the sky the 6 amber colored lig! hts were.  They were lower in the sky and were not very large.  They appeared to be about 15-20 times larger than the stars that were in the sky that night.  After observing the lights for about 3 minutes I called the Police Department nonemergency number at 8:37 pm to inquire whether anyone else had reported observing these lights in the sky.  I was informed that no one else had contacted them about the lights.  I was on the phone with the nonemergency police dispatcher for one minute (according to my cell phone).  As I continued to observe the lights travelling silently in an eastward direction to my left, one by one they began to fade out.  What was interesting was that this started with the first light, then the second, then the third, and so on (sequentially) until all 6 lights could no longer be seen.  I remember saying to the police dispatcher when she asked me about the lights that they were fading out and that some of them could no longer be seen.  The way in which the lights dimmed and faded out was as if there was a dimmer switch on them that slowly dimmed the light until it was finally out.  The speed of their movemen! t did not change, and they made no sudden or erratic movements.  Once the lights started to fade, it did not take long before the 6 lights could no longer be seen.  The entire incident from the time that I first noticed the lights lasted about 4 minutes.  I do not know how long they were there prior to the time that I noticed them.  After the lights had completely faded I looked in my review mirror and noticed a vehicle pulled over about a half of a block behind me with its headlights on.  I thought that perhaps the driver had also pulled over to observe the lights.  I turned around and went back to ask the individual if they had also witnessed the lights, but discovered that it was an individual who was in distress due to an accident and a flat tire.  The individual asked for my assistance in trying to get them out of the vehicle.  However, the door was jammed.  I called 911 to request assistance for the individual.  While waiting for the police to arrive I asked the individual if they had noticed the lights, but they stated that they had not.  Once the police arrived and were able to secure the situation I asked one of the police officers if he had seen the lights.  He said that he had not, but that they “see them all of the time”.  He said that he does not know what they are.  With regard to my background, I am a clinical social worker with a Master’s Degree in Social Work.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
7 yellow orbs in sky over Cape Coral, Fl.;2014-11-26 20:00:00;5 minutes;7 yellow orbs in sky over Cape Coral, Fl. My wife and I were standing in our back yard at 8:00 PM and saw 3 large, bright, yellow orbs low in the sky traveling NW to SE at a slow rate of speed.   As they passed overhead, 4 more lights appeared from the NW and followed the original 3.  They were in no particular formation but definitely headed in the same direction.  I should also note, that they did not make any noise and the sky was crystal clear.  We could see airplanes in the distance and there was no way that these lights could be misconstrued as domestic aircraft.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693

I saw two round spheres at 21:01 PM on 02/09/2018 flying in the sky with no sound and lower than the planes, following each other in a straight line, heading North over Cape Coral, FL.  Through binoculars it looked like many orange tinted lights in a ball.  Similar to Christmas lights.  Without binoculars it looked like balls of fire.  They were moving kinda slow, is why I noticed them from my porch.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
