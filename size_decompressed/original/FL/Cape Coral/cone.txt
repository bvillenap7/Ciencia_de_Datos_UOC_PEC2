January 8, 2011  Every night I go outside on my back porch to have a cigarette. In 2005 I saw 2 UFO’s hovering above Cape Coral /Fort Myers FL for about 40 min. Now last night my wife and I saw another UFO in the same exact spot 6 years later (1-7-2011). Not a cloud in the sky, a very clear night... It was about 4 a.m. and I watched it with binoculars for over 30 minutes.  It was hovering East/20°south at an angle of about 50 miles.  The middle of the craft was cone shaped, like a white floodlight, and was as BRIGHT as a star, and around this was a frosted glass-like green bowl shape, with red spinning lights. This thing was HUGE and had to be the size of a Wal-Mart, so there is no way that this “aircraft” could be man-made.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
