A large heron?  No it was gliding, low and quietly.  I had to re-adjust my focus for it not to seemingly shapeshift.  It was dimly lit with 6 large circular, effervescent lights. “That is a craft- a UFO”  It felt far away yet very low.  No size description adequately captures it.  It did not carry an ominous vibe, a silent observer.  It made me feel grounded.   We ran around to the front of the house, it had gone.  I asked him to draw what he saw, He drew a boomerang shape and said it had a soft green glow.  I drew mine, a chevron with 6 lights. We both have never seen a UFO before.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
