There was no sound.   The object went into and out of the clouds disappearing, then coming back with a constant orange glow kind-of like a flame on a candle-- then it went into the clouds and was gone --  A few days later I saw the same thing while walking the dogs about 7:40 pm to the northwest heading in the same direction but followed by another one.   The clouds were thicker and lower so they disappeared before they got to my location.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
