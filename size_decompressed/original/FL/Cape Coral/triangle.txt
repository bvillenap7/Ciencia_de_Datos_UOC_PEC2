I was out doing my daily walk in the evening on Halloween night in my neighborhood.  I was almost home and finished with my walk when I happened to look up and suddenly saw a triangle shaped object with 3 lights on the bottom (in each corner)- absolutely no sound.  I just stood there not believing what I was seeing.  I had noticed some kids out trick or treating earlier and I quickly looked around to see if anyone was out but there was nobody at that time.  I looked back up and I thought it had gone behind a cloud (I think the only one in the sky because it was a clear evening), but it was gone.  I ran to the house to tell my husband and some friends and we went outside to look but never saw anything else.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
large triangle shaped almost transparent craft traveling low and slow with no lights or sound.;2010-09-29 20:40:00;1 to 1.5 min;large triangle shaped almost transparent craft traveling low and slow with no lights or sound. This is the second time in as many weeks I have watched a large transparent craft fly over my home. the first time it was low and slow, and appeared to be extreemly large.  AS it wen't over it blotted out the stars, and looked like glass.  this last time it was higher and faster but deffinately the same type craft.  My daughter was whitness to the first one lasting about 2 mins.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693

Triangular shaped craft with four bright lights over Cape Coral, FL.;2015-02-08 20:00:00;15 minutes;Triangular shaped craft with four bright lights over Cape Coral FL My 21 yr old son and I went out to walk our dog at approximately 8:00 pm on Sunday, February 8, 2015.  We were walking west down a long street in northern Cape Coral, FL.  This street we were on at the time has no homes and no street lights and it was pitch black.  It was a cool evening.  The sky was completely clear and full of stars.   As we walked, we noticed two very bright seemingly stationary lights in the sky to the west straight ahead of us.  I assumed they were planets and my son checked his Google Sky Map app on his phone and confirmed that the bright light on the left was Venus, but there was no explanation for the bright light to the right of it.  We naturally assumed it was a plane approaching but it was silent – no preceding jet noise – and it did not appear to be moving for quite some time. We continued walking west toward it for several minutes.  Eventually it began to appear larger. As it got closer, the light which had at first seemed to have an orangish hue to it became a very bright white.  We still thought it was a plane but were puzzled by the silence.  It finally passed overhead very, very slowly moving eastward with the faintest whirring sound.   We knew then that it was definitely not any kind of plane we’d ever seen before because we could see the outline of it against the sky and it was triangular.  It had one very large, very bright white light on the front and three identical lights across the back.  There were no flashing lights and no red or blue lights like we normally see on planes.  Also, the lights were much bigger than lights we've seen on jets in the past.   We turned and watched it continue moving slowly to the east.  It finally seemed to pick up speed and completely disappeared.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
Florida is a Hot Spot for Black Budget aircraft and Space Capable vehicles;2016-02-17 19:45:00;6 minutes;Florida is a Hot Spot for Black Budget aircraft and Space Capable vehicles While walking my dogs on a clear windless night, I noticed a cloud that was a slender triangle shape with an opaque stern section. The craft was larger than an airplane, had a defined shape to the nose and leading edges  of the narrow straight shape. The altitude was hard to determine (but an educated guess is between 3,000' and 5.000') due to the nature of the semi cloaked image. The speed at which this object was moving was very quick at approx. 25 MPH in a motionless, windless sky! The direction was from the Gulf of Mexico or NW of my position and moved in a straight line towards the SE or the Everglades and South of Miami. The object showed no lights or propulsion system but did glide silently and with a clear determined direction. I am a trained observer and have viewed several AF or Navy aircraft operating in our area over the Gulf waters. I have reported these sightings to Mufon and to Filer's Files and have matched perfectly other sightings with testimony and photos with other observers at different times up to 2 years apart. There seems to be Ion thruster types, plasma powered types Vasimr rocket types and cloaking exercises with short contrails during the last minutes of the sunset over the water here. Reports year after year of similar reports are ignored by Mufon. It is apparent that the Black Budget folks operate over SW Florida all of the time.  High probability of human engineering, low probability of UAP.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693

I was looking up at Mars and directly above head a triangle shaped craft was travling south in direction. The triangle had very dim rectangle lights at each point. The craft appeared to have a vibrational hue around the lights. It was also colorless or almost as if it was cloaked. There was no sound coming from th his craft either. It appeared to be very close, maybe 100 feet above head.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
