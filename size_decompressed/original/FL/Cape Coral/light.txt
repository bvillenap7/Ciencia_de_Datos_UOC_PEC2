After that the object slowed at a regular plan rate and flew for about 1 minute and disipeared. My brother was visiting Atlanta and I was joking with him about the planes landing at Ft. Myers Airport. But this object did not have running lights and was very close to the flight path of the run way;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
White light moving across the sky, very fast, and then vanishing.;2008-02-13 21:07:00;30 seconds;White light moving across the sky, very fast, and then vanishing. I was outside on the patio, at around 21:07 PM EST, while having a cigarette, I was looking up at the sky, looking at the stars.  All of a sudden, I catch a glimpse of this small ball of light, flying through the air. At first, I thought, it had to be a plane, but, I realized, I have never seen a plane going that fast. It is extremely flat here, so I had a good view of the length of the sky. It traveled that entire length, within 30 seconds and then suddenly, it just vanished.  I have never seen anything like that before. It did not emit blinking lights, like most planes do, instead, it was just a solid white(ish) light;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
3 balls of light, moving in a weird triangle formation.;2008-02-13 22:04:00;60 seconds;3 balls of light, moving in a weird triangle formation. I just reported a sighting earlier at around 21:07 PM EST., about a single ball of light.  I was just again, outside smoking a cigarette, while I noticed 3 more balls of light, they were not flashing, just sold white light. The 3 were flying, very high, in a crooked triangle formation. Preceeding noticing them, I saw an aircraft, 757, most likely, flying towards Fort Meyers International Airport. There 3 balls of light, were flying away from it. I am not sure of what direction it is, I am new to the area and rather confused as to the layout.  I have never in my life, seen anything like it. I had to constantly, look away and tell myself, I can not be just seeing things. Totally bizzare.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693

Two lights that hovered and then shot off, in the Florida sky.;2013-03-25 22:00:00;10 minutes;two lights that hovered and then shot off, in the Florida sky. There were two solid lights, one was a dark yellow/orange and the other was red.  They were very still in the sky and were too high to be towers and too low to be stars.  They eventually began moving in a direction over mt house and toward the moon.  The red one was first and began moving quite quickly and once it passed overhead,  itded into a kind of blue-gray.  And evidently went even faster because it appeared to shoot up and last the moon until it was no longer visible.   When I looked back at the orange-yellow light, it had also began to move in the exact same direction. It did the exact same thing but its color stated the same and it shot off just a bit before the place that the first light did.  Neither made any sound that I could hear.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
Orange light hovering and then moving horizontal in Cape Coral, Florida.;2014-01-02 22:00:00;5 minutes;Orange light hovering and then moving horizontal in Cape Coral, Florida Between the hours of 21:00 and 23:00, I observed a bright orange light in the shape of a sphere hover and then move horizontally to the south before fading out. I was on my route at the southwestern end of Cape Coral Parkway when I noticed the object. It was lower than the normal air traffic that typically passes the same area.  At first I thought it was a Chinese lantern.  I stopped my vehicle and watched the orange ball slowly float upwards.  The night was fairly clear and the object seemed to be below the clouds present. After about a minute of slow upwards movement the object began to move horizontally to the south.  My view was looking west northwest and tracked the object to the west southwest before the light faded. I was not able to estimate the speed but it not seem to be faster than the aircraft I typically observe. I also observed the same object the following night at a different location. On the night of January 4, 2014 I noticed the same orange globe over Pelican Baseball Field. It was around 22:30 and slightly raining.  I was again facing west observing the object. It appeared to be at the western end of the field possibly over the neighborhood west of the field.  Height was undeterminable due to the rainy, overcast condition of the night sky.  The only reference on height was that it was higher than the field lights. After a short time, about 30 seconds to a minute, the orange light made a few erratic movements and then began to head in my direction.  It slowly moved directly at me maintaining its altitude or possibly gaining.  I lost sight of the object as it flew over my vehicle.  I was not able to find it once I started my car and began to head north on Pelican.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693

Yellowish UFO light sighting at night.;2014-08-23 22:00:00;Returning home;Yellowish UFO light sighting at night Returned home from dinner and a movie at a friend’s, when my girlfriend noticed our returning sighting of a yellowish glowing object hovering about a quarter of a mile up into the North Western sky.   We stood and watched for a second as we always do and decided after 2 minutes to enter our home and I immediately go to my office door facing the North Western sky and it was gone as usual.  Not the first sighting and it always sits around and then slowly moves up at an angle and then gone or literally it will just vanish.   Although it was heat lighting in the air, it is not always lighting when they are visible.  All within 5 mins it was there and then gone.   It is definitely a ufo and it makes no sound.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693

Glowing orange spheres over Cape Coral.;2015-06-05 22:00:00;2;Glowing orange spheres over Cape Coral. While driving in my vehicle at approximately 22:00hrs, I observed 3 orange glowing objects toward the north east.  The three objects were in a triangular pattern very high up in the night sky and changing their positions not necessarily holding the triangular pattern all the time. Then the three objects separated and one of them came directly at me over head moving west bound while maintaining its height.  The other two went up.  One went very fast. So fast that I blinked as it was moving and it was gone.  The last one also was traveling upward at a much slower speed until it went out of sight. These objects were at the altitude of conventional aircraft or maybe a little higher.  They didn't move like conventional aircraft and the glowing orange light which they emitted never pulsated but was constant.  There were no other lights associated with them such as conventional aircraft are equipped with. I was not able to exit my vehicle due to the flow of traffic behind me and am unable to witness to if they made any sound.

The fire was out down to embers.;2015-12-25 21:00:00;15 minutes;We had spent an couple hours enjoying a very small fire in a rock fire pit in our back yard.   The fire was out down to embers, and the moon and the street lights in front of the house were the brightest light sources in the area.   We saw(4) lights at maybe 5*-10* west of due south.  The lights were pumpkin orange and brighter than the handful of stars visible facing south at the time.  They were as bright or maybe slightly dimmer than the north star (opposite direction in the sky so a true visual comparison was not possible.  However, I did look briefly behind me to use it as a general basis for comparison).   The lights appeared out of no where and appeared to move independently for the first minute we saw them.  They all shifted position both vertically and horizontally 2 or 3 times rather quickly.   They then adjusted position relative to each other and formed a perfect square in the sky.  It maintained this for about 3-5 minutes.  Then one light (upper right ! of the square) disappeared suddenly like turning off a light.  With the two left lights maintaining position, the lower right moved out and up, the three forming an equilateral triangle pointing west. It maintained this formation for 5-7 minutes or so.  Just floating there.  During this time, a commercial flight crossed between us and the lights while traveling west to east.  From our view point it passed directly between us and the lower left light blocking it out completely in passing with the light reappearing in it's location after passing.  The plane's lights were on and was likely either circling or on final approach to Southwest Florida International Airport (RSW).  The plane was visibly brighter (about 2 times), and much lower in the sky, with both solid and flashing lights on.  The lower left light looked like it descended suddenly out of sight.  The lower right light appeared to travel due west and out of sight.  Neither of these had a trail of any kind, just a qu! ick moving point of light.  The upper light appeared to remain! in plac e but just got fainter and fainter over about 30 seconds and faded out once the other two had gone.  It was like watching a light traveling directly away from you until it disappears.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693

Can't say for sure.   Kinda creepy to witness these things first hand;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
Orange lights single file cross the nights Sky.  ((anonymous report);2017-12-12 19:00:00;45 minutes;Orange lights single file cross the nights Sky. Our UFO sighting 12/12/17  At approximately 7 pm last night at our Western Cape Coral, FL, home my wife and I observed bright orange lights in the nights sky.  These lights where moving from west to east in direction and passed one at a time for perhaps 45 minutes each taking perhaps 3 minutes to travel seemingly constant altitude arcing over from the eastern horizon (approx 10 miles to the tree line from our vantage point) to east of us, and then disappearing before reaching the trees to our eastern horizon.  We didn’t count the number of objects but to say 25 would be a good guess.  No sound was heard and the usual commercial air traffic was observed well above and out in the distance.  The objects speed  seemed the same for all  and it was hard to determine if the objects where big and very far away or smaller and close.  What we saw looked to be about 4 times the size of the stars in the sky and much, much brighter.  The only formation observed was that they where in single file.  Not evenly spaced either.  We might see one alone then two or three in quick recession and again nothing for a few minutes before another would seemingly illuminate at the western horizon much brighter then other lights.

Orange blinking light making very fast unusual maneuvers over Cape Coral, FL;2019-02-27 19:35:00;15 seconds;Orange blinking light making very fast unusual maneuvers over Cape Coral, FL At approximately 7:35 pm this evening, on 2/27/2019, my wife and I both noticed an unusual orange rapidly blinking light dropping very fast out of the sky at a unique downward angle (we see lots of planes RSW airport nearby).  The blinking orange light then made a swift downward 45-degree change in the opposite direction and went behind a small cloud.   We both stopped dead in our tracks to see this object return again from the cloud, but it never came out of the small cloud.  We stood there approximately five more minutes and only noticed the normal planes coming in and out of Fort Myers airport. There was a drone flying in the area during the time of the sighting, and what we saw was not a drone.  The blinking light we saw did not match the speed or appearance of which this drown was flying.  The blinking light also did not match the speed or presence of any airplanes flying in the area as well.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
Light moving sporadically over SW Florida coast.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect either Venus, or Sirius.  PD));2020-04-29 22:00:00;30 minutes;Light moving sporadically over SW Florida coast I am a resident of Cape Coral, Florida.  I am retired from the Missouri Judiciary and a former pilot.  This evening, April 29, 2020, approximately 10:00PM eastern time I noticed a light about the brightness of a bright star southwest of my position which would have put it over Sanibel Island, Florida.  It was approximately 30 degrees off the horizon on a mostly clear evening.  The light seemed to be a cluster of lights or a larger object that had rotating lights on it. I watched the light for approximately 25 minutes.  During that time it maintained its position in the sky but its movements were very sporadic.  I used a pair of 10 X 50 binoculars and positioned the light adjacent to a power pole so I could better determine the object’s movements.  I discount the idea that it was a drone because the movements were so erratic.  Based on my observation using the power pole as a reference I estimate the movements were several hundred feet in all directions. The lights were of various colors from red, green blue and white.  The colors were very vibrant.  The colors diminished later to mostly white.  The object started to slowly descend over a period of time and was finally obstructed from my view.  I had seen a similar object several times in the sky at my home in central Missouri.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
