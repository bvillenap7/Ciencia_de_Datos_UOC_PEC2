Orange flickering object in sky over Cape Coral;2017-10-18 07:00:00;20:00;Orange flickering object in sky over Cape Coral Twice this morning, Iâ€™ve seen an orange flickering light moving under clouds slowly at distance over Cape Coral.  At times it disappeared, and then reappeared on the same path.  No FAA lights, just a rapidly flickering orange.  It seemed to be on the same course each pass, but the second pass was lower.  It was moving from east to west each time.  I first saw it just after 7:00 am, and then again at 7:28 am.  I thought it rather unusual.;26.6366192560174;-81.9844960612693
