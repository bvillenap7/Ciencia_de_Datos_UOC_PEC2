The light appears to be able to move at 90 degree angles.  We noticed it at about 8:00 pm this evening and it is still going.  It appears to be using the clouds as a cover.  It is emiting enough light to glow through the clouds, but the light is obviously coming from above the clouds, maybe at 10,000 feet or so.  From our house in Belleview, this light is to the west of where we are.;29.0510999999999;-82.0380000000001
