I happene;2008-04-20 12:00:00;2 minutes;It was a clear cloudless Sunday afternoon and we were coming back from church heading north on US 301 near belleview florida.  I happened to be looking into the northeast sky when I seen 2 objects in the distance, one was a meatallic cigar shaped craft just sitting in the sky dormant, and to the right of the cigar shaped craft was a round orb object (which changes color from red to green to amber) moving up and down than doing 90 degree angles.  I was driving but had a clear view of this for about 10 seconds or so, than a few trees got in my way for about 5 seconds than I came to a clearing and they both were gone.   This is the second sighting in my life which I have seen.;29.0510999999999;-82.0380000000001
