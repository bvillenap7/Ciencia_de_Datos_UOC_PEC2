Glowing saucer-shaped light hovering, then lowering.;2003-11-11 18:10:00;15 min.;Glowing saucer-shaped light hovering, then lowering. I was outside on my back porch just after dusk when I noticed a bright white light in the southwestern sky. It was fairly low in the sky about 25 degrees above the horizon and about the size of my pinkie fingernail at arms length. The light was glowing in a saucer-shape, motionless for about 10 minutes before 2 commercial planes were in its vicinity and it seemed to get smaller until they left the area. Then it returned to its previous size and gradually began to get lower in the sky until it was below the treeline near me and I could not see it anymore. This is now my third sighting in all, and all seem to be in the same part of the sky(near Tampa Bay/Gulf of Mexico).;27.9031871938779;-82.2857972448996
Neon yellow huge saucer seen next to full moon.;2013-03-23 22:00:00;4 minutes;Neon yellow huge saucer seen next to full moon My mother, sister and I were driving down a dark long road on our way home, when I spotted something left of the full moon.  It was shaped like a typical saucer you would see in the movies, the shape of two bowls stacked on each other.   It was perfectly still, neon yellow and about the same size as the moon.  It had a greenish glow to it and was very very still, like a picture.   At the end of the road there was some gas stations and pharmacies, and I'm sure there were cars next to ours.  I think they may have witnessed it as well, but I can't be sure.   I pointed it out to my mother and sister and they both looked at it in awe and shock.  It was way too still to be a kite or a blimp.   I'm not sure anyone else saw it besides me and my family, but it was visibly there in the sky for as long as I was being drove down the road.  I'd say it lasted about 4 minutes, before the trees got in the way.   I can't seem to remember the rest of that night for some reason.  Which is another thing I find kind of peculiar, as something extraordinary as that is to be forgotten.   I hope this information is useful.

FAST disc of bluish/white light.;2014-10-12 20:25:00;2 seconds;FAST disc of bluish/white light. While sitting outside on my apartment balcony, I was enjoying the evening.  The skies were pretty clear and for once I saw more stars than usual.  Not enough to write home about, but more than most nights.   All of a sudden, I saw a disc of bluish/white light going RAPIDLY from East to West.  It was fast and it crossed the horizon in only seconds.  There were no flashing lights as the whole thing was lit up as if from inside.  It was not brightly lit either, maybe the equivalent of a TV left on at night seen from across the neighborhood.   It was FAST.  I've never seen anything like that and I've never seen anything move that fast in the night sky before.   Its path was straight with no deviation whatsoever, it just zipped across the sky and disappeared in the East.  If I had to guess how big it might have been, Iâ€™d say maybe the size of two jumbo jets put together given how high up in the sky it seemed to be.  No sound.;27.9031871938779;-82.2857972448996
