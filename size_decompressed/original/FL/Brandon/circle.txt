Ball of light falls from the sky.;2009-07-12 23:00:00;2 seconds;Ball of light falls from the sky. It was a clear night, no clouds visible. I was in my front yard talking on my phone when a light caught my attention.  When I looked up (South East of Brandon, FL) I saw a ball of light in the sky falling straight down with no trail behind it.   I watched it fall for about 2 full seconds before I lost sight of it behind the tree line. I waited to hear a sound because if it was a man made craft it surely would have crashed.  I heard nothing - saw nothing after losing sight of it behind the trees.   It was too large and too bright to be a falling star and from where I was I would say it was half the size of a full moon high in the night sky.  I have no idea what it was.  I searched the internet today to see if there was anything in the news about it but found nothing.  After searching UFO witness reports I found similar instances and decided to add mine to the list.;27.9031871938779;-82.2857972448996
Two strange crafts observed on July 4th;2017-07-04 21:30:00;5 minutes;Two strange crafts observed on July 4th. My wife and I were in our backyard watching fireworks, when we looked to the North and noticed a very bright red/yellow circular object flying east to west.   The craft was flying low, no sound, and when it flew under a cloud its lights turned off, but the object was still visible.  Two minutes later, a second object, with the same characteristics, flew past, and again extinguished lights and disappeared.;27.9031871938779;-82.2857972448996
