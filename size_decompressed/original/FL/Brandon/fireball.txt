Fireballs over Brandon Florida;2012-07-22 00:00:00;5 minutes;Fireballs over Brandon Florida While in my backyard I sorted one object from the east heading west at a fast speed before slowing down and then heading NW.  I told my buddy to go get his phone to record it.  A the first object went out of sight we noticed 2 more traveling the same pattern followed by 3 more then 2 more.  They all seemed to follow the first object.  Then shortly after another lone object came and feed the others before vanis hing None of the objects made any noise and were not that high in the sky.

Two red-orange fireballs flying silently over Tampa;2013-01-01 00:55:00;~5 minutes;Two red-orange fireballs flying silently over Tampa Saw two red-orange objects that looked like very bright fireballs, one trailing the first (about three closed fists together at arm's length separation between them) flying silently from the south to the northwest at just before 1am visible for a few minutes (neighborhood tree tops on the south to very low clouds on the northwest). These looked two to three times larger and brighter than the ISS. The line of flight was about 70 degrees high from the west.;27.9031871938779;-82.2857972448996
Ufo on fire in sky.;2016-11-25 18:30:00;5 minutes;Ufo on fire in sky My wife and I watched this thing for 5 minutes as it circled as if it was waiting to land at the St Pete, Fl, airport.  This thing was engulfed in flames flying in the air.  As it got further another plane was close to it.   We then saw 3 flashes of flames, then it disappeared.  Did the other plane shoot it down?  No news reports or anything online;27.9031871938779;-82.2857972448996
