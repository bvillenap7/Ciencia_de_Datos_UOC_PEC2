I don't know exactly how many there were but I would guess 7 or 9 approximately.  The sighting lasted about 10 to 15 second but I lost sight because of trees and clouds.  There was no noise.  I saw aircraft right afterwards, but I don't know what kind or if it had anything to do with that.;27.9031871938779;-82.2857972448996
