RECTANGULAR WHITE LIGHT OVER BRANDON,FLORIDA;2008-08-12 00:15:00;2 seconds;RECTANGULAR WHITE LIGHT OVER BRANDON,FLORIDA My wife,my brother,and i were coming out of the house,when a rectangle of white light,with the back side split into two narrow columns showed(traveling north) in the sky,at high speed,but low enough for me to notice the shape.It disappeared while entering a cloud(it did not fade away,it just disappeared).We could not detect any sound,but the reason we were able to see it was because of its brightness and low altitude.;27.9031871938779;-82.2857972448996
opaque trapazoidal object;2009-07-31 11:45:00;2 minutes;opaque trapazoidal object While driving south out of Brandon Fl. I observed what appeared to be a trapazoidal object that was slowly moving from west to east.  It was the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length. It was colored grey and had an opaque quality to it as you could make out the clouds outlines behind the object.  It was about thirty five degrees above the horizon.  A forty second stop at a traffic light confirmed its slow movement.  Visual contact was lost after a curve brought a line of trees obscuring my vision and I could no longer located the object after the tree line ended.  Imagine one half of a  box kite floating in the air, that's what I compare to what I saw.;27.9031871938779;-82.2857972448996
