Hovering, blimp-like structure, someone else must have seen it.;2015-12-29 21:00:00;30 minutes;hovering, blimp-like structure, someone else must have seen it me and my boyfriend were driving along Bloomingdale Ave around 9pm.  I saw what appeared to be a shooting star.  Less than two minutes later my boyfriend saw another one.  we turned onto John Moore which is the approximate direction the stars disappeared.  halfway down the road I looked to my left and my heart dropped.  I saw a hovering blimp like structure right above the treetops about less than a mile away.  It had blinking red lights.   my boyfriend thought it was a blimp at first but it was lighting up the area around it. we were driving to our destination and it still didn't move.  less than two hours later we left the place we were at and it was gone.   there was nothing in the sky for miles around us.  if it was a blimp I imagine if it wasn't moving before it would still be there.  but nothing.  I've seen a blimp before and that wasn't a blimp.   I was never that scared or felt like I was being watched like that before. someone else had to see it because there was still a good amount of people still or driving.;27.9031871938779;-82.2857972448996

Hovered and flew above driving traffic on highway 60 oval/round in shape flew over tree lines then out of sight.  The blinking lights were electric blue in color and were so bright they glowed into my vehicle making everything with a blue tint to it.  They were on what looked like the bottom of the craft.;27.9031871938779;-82.2857972448996
