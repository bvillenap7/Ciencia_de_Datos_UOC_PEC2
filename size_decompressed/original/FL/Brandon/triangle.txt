Brandon, Florida, Nov. 19, 2016 standing outside to see the space shuttle take off it was approximately 6:30 pm and towards the north;2016-11-19 18:30:00;2-3 minutes;Brandon Florida November 19, 2016 standing outside to see the space shuttle take off it was approximately 6:30 pm and towards the north was this large bright light my mother and I told my daughter it was a street lamp a few streets over.  Then I turn away and back again and wow it grew brighter a slight amber glow.  it moved a bit so immediately knew it was not a lamp post! It hoovered for about a minute.  There was a food delivery person at a neighbors walking back to his car I said to him hey what do you think that is pointing to this big rather low now flying towards us object!  He said wow I'd like to say it's a plane but wow I can't I don't know what it is!  We all stood andcwatched it fly over us when it was picking up speed and altitude we seen it flip on its side (idk if it was its actual side maybe it was on the side before!  Idk)  watched it the lights dimmed and then there were three red lights this thing appeared to be a triangle shaped object large quite and thin.  Then it quickly disappeared! .;27.9031871938779;-82.2857972448996
Silent triangular UFO over Brandon, Florida.;2017-03-21 21:15:00;2-3 minutes;Silent Triangular UFO over Brandon, Florida We were driving south on Faulkenburg Blvd. towards home in Brandon at about 21:12 hours.  I saw what I thought was the back view of  a jumbo jet heading towards MacDill Air Force base on my right over a field.  It got my attention because it was so large and seemed so close.  There was a large white light in the center, with a small blue light on one side and another white light on the other side---as if on wing ends.  There was a small red light on the belly of it and was blinking.   However, as we got closer, we saw it definitely wasn’t moving.  So then we thought it was a tower of some kind with weird lights, but there are no towers in that area and it definitely wasn’t that, because I saw this thing rotate mid-air rather than turn.  It was definitely triangular/teardrop sort of shape---kind of both of those.  It reminded me of the jets I saw in the sixties and seventies, only a little larger.  I‘ve spent a good portion of my life in and around the military, so I‘ve seen a few.  Its nose definitely pointed downwards briefly for about ten seconds or so, not really straight down, but at an angle and there was a long shaft off the nose of it.  I saw a flash of dark metal as it shifted and the definite shape.  We heard no noise whatsoever.  It appeared to sit quietly in mid-air at about eight stories up, it didn‘t seem to be much above the tree line from our point of sight from the road.  My daughter (29 years old) kept saying, “It’s so close.  What IS that?!”   My husband nearly drove off the road into the bushes because we’d gotten so excited, but he didn‘t see it because, well, he was driving.  By the time he’d turned around, it had moved in the opposite direction going North/Northwest towards Tampa International, but it had gotten really far really fast without a sound.  If I had to hazard a guess, I’d say it was some sort of stealth jet with an odd shape.  However, I have never seen a craft quietly rotate mid-air like that or head off so fast ! without a sound.  It just didn’t behave like a plane, blimp (wa! s way too fast for that), drone (was too large for that), or helicopter.  And it sure was no weather balloon!;27.9031871938779;-82.2857972448996
3 white bright flashing lights shaped as a triangle with no sound .;2019-11-22 22:35:00;10 seconds;3 white bright flashing lights shaped as a triangle with no sound . I was taking my girlfriend to target and she lives kinda by the city, but mo near like trees and everything . I was driving her to a retail store and she pointed out 3 white dots flashing and we were astonished on how bright they were . They were about 50 feet ahead of us. I was about to pull out my phone but I figured I’d do that after I park and stop somewhere instead of nowhere so while I was driving the trees had covered me and the lights disappeared and that’s when we figured it wasn’t from here . There was no sound just lights that seemed close. We went searching for it and when driving we saw another light above a lake and it seemed like it was landing but once again we drove past some tall trees and it disappeared! I was amazed and mad that I couldn’t fully see it .;27.9031871938779;-82.2857972448996

I;2021-06-28 15:48:00;20 seconds;At 3:47 pm at the end of June, I had the urge to leave my work desk (insurance agent) and eat crackers while looking out the window. I never have the urge to do this, and haven't since. There was a strangely bright cloud. It was different from the other clouds. I purposefully compared them all. I had a strange feeling of being mesmerized or unable to move, perplexed by this cloud. I was not afraid until after the event. I felt something was hiding in the cloud.  Suddenly, a metal triangle appeared. I don't recall if it appeared out of thin air, came from the cloud, or appeared from the 2-story house's roof next to me. I'm guessing it was half a mile up in the air if I could see it from that distance, meaning it was possibly 150-200 feet wide. It was horizontal to the ground, likely 1-2 miles away. It measured only a centimeter or less across from where I stood in my home, but it was clearly far away. It can be described as medium-dark metal because it shined and reflected sunlight on its corners as it rotated. There was no exhaust. No sound, no hum. I knew I could not grab a phone because it would be gone. The shape was precisely like an angled ruler.  As I stared at this horizontal metal triangle in the sky, it started to slowly rotate around. Then, to my ultimate surprise, it slowly went vertical and began to TUMBLE north. This was a slow process. Imagine throwing an angled ruler at someone, holding it vertically (not like a frisbee), and recording it, to show it in ultra slow motion. That's how it appeared to disappear into the treeline beyond my vision.  It was not far from the Plant City airport (maybe 4-5 miles east), but this was literally as clear as day and my eyes have never deceived me. It was Absolutely Nothing like an airplane, weather balloon, kite, drone, or anything I can find. It appeared that it was near the post office on East MLK and Kingsway, which is a more rural area than Tampa or Brandon.  I'm not mentally ill and have never suffered hallucinations. I've never seen anything like this and cannot find a UFO that looks like it. Because of this, I felt the need to report this for your records. Thank you for reading. It has made me very paranoid and aware of the skies since then.;27.9031871938779;-82.2857972448996
