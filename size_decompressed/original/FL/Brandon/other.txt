I saw a glowing, boomerang/sickle shaped object in the sky over Brandon;2011-11-18 00:30:00;approx 5 seconds;I saw a glowing, boomerang/sickle shaped object in the sky over Brandon I was standing outside on my back porch walking my dog, it was about 12:30am.  The sky was clear when suddenly an object appeared. I thought it was a shooting star at first, but it vanished and then reappeared.  There was not tail, or trail of any kind, no visible propulsion system and the object was silent.  It was smaller than a full moon and the shape was sort of like a boomerang, but with a point coming out the back in the middle. It was NOT “V” shaped, or triangular, or chevron shaped, it was rounded on the front, almost like a sickle blade, not pointed.  The whole object was glowing an almost orange-cream color. It was moving incredibly fast, I only saw it for MAYBE 5 seconds, and in that time it shot across the sky and I lost it as it went over my roof.  If I point to where I first saw it and where I lost it, my arms are at about a 110 degree angle. It was definitely not an air plane or helicopter, there were no flashing lights on it and it was moving! way too fast.  Its presence didn't seem to have any effect on my dog, I don't think he even noticed it, but I have never seen anything like it before.  I called the local Air force base to see if they were running any training exercises in the area and they said they weren't, and when I told them what I saw, they said it definitely was not theirs.  They referred me to call the air port and see if they knew anything about it, when I spoke with operations at Tampa International Airport, they knew nothing about what I saw. The light from the object didn't seem to go anywhere, as in it wasn't like a beam from a search light or anything of that nature, the object was simply...glowing. The object appeared in the NW and headed SE.;27.9031871938779;-82.2857972448996
