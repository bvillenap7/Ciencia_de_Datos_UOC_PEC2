At apporox. the above date and time I was sitting in my car in front of my girlfriends house.  We were arguing and she was sitting in the front passenger seat yelling at me.  I looked out my front windshield and approx. 100' ahead of me and 100' high I saw what appeared to be '3' rows of stadium type lighting.  The lights were all white, but not bright enough that you couldn't look at it.  At first glance I thought nothing of it.  I blew it off as stadium lighting or some kind of neighborhood lighting.  I then turned back to listen to what my girlfriend was saying.  Suddenly, it hit me...There is no lighting in that area.  The only thing in that area is a vacant field. (approx. 1 square acre). So I quickly turned my head back toward the lights and said, What is that!?.  Before my girlfriend could turn her head to observe it, the lights disappeared.  It was as if someone turned off the light switch.  I was frozen with disbelief.  I didn't say anything or take my eyes off of! the spot.  I didn't even say another word.  My girlfriend kept asking me what?, What was it?, Talk to me you're scaring me.. I didn't talk. I just slowly got out of my car, walked directly to the spot where I had seen the lights and looked up.  NOTHING was there I MEAN NOTHING! I was standing directly below where I had seen the lights and nothing was around me...no poles...no lights...nothing. I proceeded to tell my girlfriend what I had seen and she blew it off as some sort of stress related hallucination....However, a couple of nights later we were in her driveway and I was giving her a hug.  I had my back to the SITE AREA and she was facing it.  Suddenly she says, Did it look like that!?.  I turned quickly, but just as the last time it was gone.  Before I could turn my head.  She reacted the same way I did.  She was frozen and couldn't speak.  She walked over to the same spot as I did and looked up in awe. She said, I saw it. I saw what you told me about the o! ther day and just when I asked you about it, it disappeared as if someone had flipped the light switch.........What did we see??  Was it listening to us??  Was it trying to monitor our behavior?? For years I have been telling people about what I had seen.  To this day, noone has been able to explain it.  This is the first time I have gone public with this.  I am extremely credible and didn't believe in UFO's until that night. I was a Tampa Police Officer for 2 years and  Tampa Police Dispatcher for 4 years.  In fact I was a Police Dispatcher at the time of my sighting.  My girlfriend and I are no longer together,  but she was a Deputy Sheriff and is currently a detective for a local security company.  Has anyone else ever heard of this type of UFO?  Can anyone ease my conscience?;27.9031871938779;-82.2857972448996
10/20/05   21:10  Brandon, Fl.  Light  4-5 seconds  Fast moving and turning at a steadily increasing speed until it went out of sight;2005-10-20 21:10:00;4 secs.;10/20/05   21:10  Brandon, Fl.  Light  4-5 seconds  Fast moving and turning at a steadily increasing speed until it went out of sight A red light moving west to east at a smooth and steady incredible speed that made three exacting turns, seemed to gain altitude and went out of sight.   Partial clouds and clear sky.  The light was the size of a lighted cigarette end from a short distance.   I was standing in my back yard and just looked up toward the sky and it came into view from over the foof of my house. It made no sound whatsoever.  Air Force jets fly overhead here often as there is a base (McDill ) a few miles away in Tampa.  I have seen many of these, both day and night and this was NOT one.  The speed and movement of this light or object was unlike anything I have seen before. I am a real estate executive with a major corporation and am amazed at what I witnessed.;27.9031871938779;-82.2857972448996
Amber lights moving around and then disappeared.;2013-03-02 21:10:00;10 minutes;Amber lights moving around and then disappeared. At around 9:10 PM Eastern Standard Time, my son and I witnessed 7 amber or golden colored lights in the sky.  We were facing East on Doe Ct in Brandon, FL.  The Amber lights were bigger than a star maybe double the size.  I am unsure of the height but they appeared to be flying high enough for a plane. There were 7 in total.  6 of the lights were on the right and were lined up and the 7th was on the left moving to the right towards the 6th other lights.   The 6 lights appeared to move into a triangular shape and up and down.  I do not remember the exact times that they made the shapes but they appeared to form a triangle and a diamond like shape.  The movements were purposeful and deliberate.  The lights then disappeared. I called a friend and went into my home and came back out and realized the 7 lights were back again.  This time they were closer together.  They appeared to be moving up and down.   The time was 9:15 PM.    A neighbor was putting things in their car and I asked him if he knew what the lights were.  He looked at the lights and was very unsure of what they were and asked a few other neighbors to come out to witness them.   All together 5 of my neighbors stood looking at the lights baffled.  After about a few minutes the lights disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she seemed to us to a quite capable and reliable witness.

8 amber colored spheres seen in the sky traveling in formation, then disappearing.;2014-02-23 19:30:00;~4 minutes;8 amber colored spheres seen in the sky traveling in formation, then disappearing. A little after 7:30 pm, I stepped out to walk my dog.  It was a clear night and I noticed five bright amber colored circular lights traveling silently in the sky.  They were lower than an airplane but higher than a low helicopter.  They were in a straight line traveling close together from west to east.   At one point the group formed a ‘t’ like pattern.  It reminded my of an air show where planes travel very close together and make formations.   I ran inside to get my husband to see the oddity.  He came out with me and we stood at the end of my driveway and were looking at the lights traveling.  One of my neighbors was walking his dog and he also looked up to see the things in the sky.   Then in front of our eyes, one by one, they flickered out and disappeared.   My neighbor then continued home, my husband went inside and I stayed outside to see if any more would show up.   A minute or two later another string of three came through the same west to east path.  They also disappeared by flickering out. I am college educated with a masters degree in business.  I have never seen any objects in the sky behave in this manner before, nor have I ever before been a 'believer' in ufo's.;27.9031871938779;-82.2857972448996

It has been seen in this Brandon, fl area for the last 3 nights. Police helicopters, planes, military fighter planes have all came near the object.  The first night a helicopter or fighter plane got right infront of the ufo and then both crafts went down towards the ground in unison.  Never seen anything like it, if your in the Brandon, Tampa Florida area pay close attention to the sky at night for this star looking objects are in the sky as I type this no bs! Something is going on ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));27.9031871938779;-82.2857972448996
Large white Orb being tailed by Fighter Jet.;2017-04-21 22:23:00;2 minutes;Large white Orb being tailed by Fighter Jet. On the reported date and time. I was sitting on my back porch,facing west when I heard what I believed to be a helicopter coming from the south east direction. I then witnessed what appeared to be a warm white orb from behind the tree line. Then I saw what appeared to be and sounded like a fighter jet tailing the white orb. Once the jet appeared the buffeting sound of a helicopter went mute. All that was heard was the fighter jet. I watched both the UFO and the aircraft travel across the sky from southeast to northwest. I recorded as much of much of the event as I could. The video clearly shows the white orb traveling with no air craft beacons or physical fuselage,compared to the dark fighter jet with its red beacons activated. I sent the video via text to my younger brother and fiance. My brother posted the video to his twitter account around 23:00 directly after the event. By the very next morning, his tweet was deleted.  And every evidence of the post and video was deleted from his iPhone. I still have the original video on my iPhone and will send upon any request!  The goose bumps and the immense adrenaline rush is unforgettable.;27.9031871938779;-82.2857972448996
