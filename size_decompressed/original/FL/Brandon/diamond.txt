We were out in our backyard, enjoying our spa. We had just spent three rough days as Hurricane Jeanne just came through on Sunday.   We are use to seeing all sizes of airplanes, from large jets to small twin engine planes most every night.  We also see satellites, the ISS and occasionally a shooting star (Meteor).  Tonight my husband noticed and pointed out to me either several smaller objects flying in a tight formation flying in unison or one big object  with sharp edges silhoutted with multiple lights on the underside all in a  tight but sort of flexible pattern.  It was flying  at about the  speed than most big aircrafts would be flying but lower altitude.  It was flying  from  (from Orlando area) East to West toward the Gulf of Mexico.  The object changed direction, it turned more to the Southwest, but stayed in a tight formation, which is why (without our eyeglasses) we are not certain if the object(s) were one large one or several smaller ones. It almost looked like how geese fly in formation, and maybe one deviates, only these geese had lights on them.  Our first thought was it was something like the flying angel's small jets doing a night time formation up very high.  But there were no jet noises at all, which we normally hear the jet noise at some point.   Anyway thanks for giving us the opportunity to tell someone who wouldn't think we'd had too many drinks (we had none) when we tell this story. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
