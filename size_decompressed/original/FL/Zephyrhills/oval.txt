It then moved fast to the other side of the sky and stopped.It hung in one spot for about 7 seconds at that time it appeared smaller and greenish white it looked as if it was moving slow towards the east and we were trying to figure it out and then all of a sudden it started pulsating then it disappeared.There was only one and it was not a plane.It did not do what a normal plane would do.;28.2279988826815;-82.1934675977654
11/18/14 19:49 Zephyrhills FL oval/sphere 11 minutes 4 reddish-orange moved west to south no sound, no wings and no additional lights;2014-11-18 19:49:00;11 minutes;11/18/14 19:49 Zephyrhills FL oval/sphere 11 minutes 4 reddish-orange moved west to south no sound, no wings and no additional lights On a somewhat clear but slightly cool evening with a few clouds, 11/18, at 7:49 pm, I was standing at the end of my car port looking in the sky as usual.   As I turned to the west I observed very clearly 2 oval extremely bright reddish-orange almost hot looking heading very slowly heading east.  They were spaced apart with some distance and never got any further than that during the entire time I watched.   I immediately called 2 friends of mine that lived directly in it's path 6 blocks from me.  I told them just to go out and look upward.  I stayed on the cell while they went out and said they saw them and were astounded. I hung up and  continued to watch as one fell behind the cloud cover.  There were no sounds, no other visible lights, no wings.  They just moved with precision with no sense of urgency.   After I lost sight of them within 5 minutes 2 more oval shaped reddish-orange craft appeared from the same direction, same altitude moving at the same rate of speed.  Again, I watched it as it slowly disappeared.  These 2 moved at a slightly faster speed so I'd say I watched it for 3-4 minutes and it was gone.   I called my friends again and thoroughly discussed this sighting in more detail.  As I told my friends I noticed a lot of air traffic during this event but couldn't make them out but I can't say with any certainty that they were military in nature which seem to last for about 30 minutes.;28.2279988826815;-82.1934675977654
