Two large lights and one smaller light in between that blinked at about once a second.  Hovered above a large field by a smaller road then after we watched it for 10 minutes or so it went behind the clouds and changed direction moving towards our left very fast (faster than any plane we've ever seen) without any noise.;28.2279988826815;-82.1934675977654
