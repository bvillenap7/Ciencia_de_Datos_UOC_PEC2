3 orange fireballs moving in the sky.;2015-01-16 19:20:00;5 minutes;3 orange fireballs moving in the sky. I first noticed 2 orange fireballs that looked like the exhaust of a rocket, but that was all there was, heading south in the sky.   I stared at them for about 5 minutes, until they were not visible anymore, then a 3rd one seemed to be following them.  They were not airplanes or helicopters and were silent.  They were just orange fireballs moving in the sky.;28.2279988826815;-82.1934675977654
