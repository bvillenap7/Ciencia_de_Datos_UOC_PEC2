I got up from my bed, and I thought I left a lite on as the bedroom was all lit up.  no, the light was coming through the window, I looked out and saw a circle object above my nabors house across the street.  on the west side of the streey it was so big it could have been coming from a few blocks away.  my nabors house is 30 feet wide and this circle was a good 10 feet bigger on both sides I stood there and watched.  the color looked like the moon, what ever color that is.  after 10 min.  I just went back to bed.;28.2279988826815;-82.1934675977654
