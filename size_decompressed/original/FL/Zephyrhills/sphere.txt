Again at the end of my carport I was lookig upward around 8:17 pm and this time the sky was 100% clear and another cool night.   There was no wind whatsoever when all of a sudden I couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing.  The ones yesterday were a nice size which couldn't be mistaken for anything other than what they appeared to be.  This one on this night was 50 times as big, brighter color and looked like it was shimmering and on fire and coming down quickly and when I say quickly I mean I'd bet and I'm not a betting person that it landed.  I had a clear look with no obstructions to my view.  I mean it descended rapidly but I never heard an impact but I know for a fact that it made contact with the ground.  I mean this was the biggest and closest UFO I'd ever seen.  From my vantage point it seemed very close.  Duration:  27 seconds.;28.2279988826815;-82.1934675977654
