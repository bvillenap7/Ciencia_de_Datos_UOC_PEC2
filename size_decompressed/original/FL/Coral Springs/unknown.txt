Something in the sky thats changing colors and in the same spot for at least two hours...just gets higher.;2008-08-11 02:30:00;2 hours;Something in the sky thats changing colors and in the same spot for at least two hours...just gets higher. In the sky above some trees behind the apt. Looks like a start but too close and changing colors. Not getting closer or moving any further away. seems to be kind of bouncing up and down. Slowly moving higher in the sky in the same direction. Stayed north east the whole time for at least two hours. Just strange for something to be there that long in the same spot...and the fact that it keeps changing colors. Saw it a few days ago for the first time in the same exact place for about 3 hours. It is now back. wish it was closer.;26.267385;-80.271375

4 red lights seen in the clear night sky lined up in order traveling up and disappeared.;2013-12-06 22:20:00;2-3 minutes;4 red lights seen in the clear night sky lined up in order traveling up and disappeared. I just witnessed 4 red lights in the sky tonight 12/6/2013 between 10:15pm-10:25pmET.  I left my phone in my house, but I was out walking my dog because I heard 2 strange popping sounds - I thought maybe a neighbor was outside so I went to inspect.  Initially 1 red light caught my eye but I noticed another and then another, in all I saw 4 red lights.  At first I thought they were planes, but they seemed to be in a formation that I did not believe a passenger airline would use and the red light was uncommon. Then I thought they were potentially missiles because they were moving so fast, but they all disappeared. I am not sure if they just vanished or they were traveling so fast that it just went out of my sight.  The skies are dark but clear. I can see stars clearly and these were not stars or shooting stars.  The lights resemble what was captured in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwpHT18pJYE&feature=youtu.be - the main difference was that the 4 lights were all lined up, one after another.;26.267385;-80.271375
