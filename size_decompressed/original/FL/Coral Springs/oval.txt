Me and my dad were driving home from the park.  I started to see something fairly odd in the clouds, it was as if something was in front of the clouds.  I kept staring in the same place and it seemed as if something oval was moving steadily away.  The most craziest part is that it was like a chameleon.  A way to explain it in one word is that the craft was invisible.  It took the color of the clouds and everything around it and if you stared hard you can see that something is off from the area it was in then eventually making out the craft.   I shouted out to my dad A UFO! A UFO! well he was driving and of course it would take a while to find it with the naked eye, and when we were turning away from the area from where I can see it, it started to zoom away.;26.267385;-80.271375
