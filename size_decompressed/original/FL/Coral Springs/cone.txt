I stopped my car turned off the engine and there was no sound coming from them.  Even as they passed the orange glow remained. It appeared the same coming and going.  I watched until they got out of range. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));26.267385;-80.271375
