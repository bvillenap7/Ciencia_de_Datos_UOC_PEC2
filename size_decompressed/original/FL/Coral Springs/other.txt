It couldn't have been an airplane because it was It was around 12:00 at night and I was spending the night at a friends house. Of course we were up late even though we had things to do the next morning. We decided that we should invite some more people over and go into the backyard for a little night swimming. After everyone got there awe headed into the pool and about ten minutes into it I saw something in the sky, it was a red light, not very big but it was fairly bright. It couldn't have been an airplane because it was eratacly moving around, like no airplane that i've ever heard of can do without reaching the burbling point and stalling. I pointed up and told the few people that were surrounding me to look up, they were as shocked as I was. We sat there and watched it until it just dissapeared. It must have been an either really big object or very bright because our teacher doesn't even live int the same city as us and he saw it, and it was at about the same time we saw it to. The next day in school we were still a little freaked out by what we had seen and decided not to tell anyone, but our teacher brought it up. He asked if anyone else had seen the UFO last night. Me and my friends raised our hands and we began to discuss this in class. It turns out that a few of my classmates had also apparently seen it as well. My teacher had called his friend who used to fly F-14's for the navy and he said that it would be impossible for it to have been a plane from it's movement. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

white spot moving silently and rapidly across the sky in 1 direction and then the exact opposite direction;2008-11-15 20:30:00;1 minute;white spot moving silently and rapidly across the sky in 1 direction and then the exact opposite direction I was looking through my small telescope using the low power eye piece when a rapidly moving white dot moved across the field of view from left to right.  There was no trail as if from a meteorite entering the atmosphere.  The telescope was pointed almost directly overhead, but slightly north and west.  The dot moved VERY quickly and was unlike anything I had seen before.  I went inside to ask my wife to come out and look to see if she could see anything.  I then looked through the eyepiece again and an object that appeared to be the same, moved at the same speed in the exact opposite direction (a reciprocal heading).  I've seen the ISS with the naked eye and this object was NOT the ISS.  The object was not visible with the naked eye.
