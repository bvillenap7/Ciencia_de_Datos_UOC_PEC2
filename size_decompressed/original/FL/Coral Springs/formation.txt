Strange linear lights hovering in the sky two nights in a row;2019-03-28 00:00:00;1 hour;Strange linear lights hovering in the sky two nights in a row I witnessed two object floating in the sky, a linear formation of 3 lights.  One object was orange and green.  The other object was blue and purple.  Previous night a blue and purple object was shooting red projectiles down to earth.  It smelled like a forest fire outside in Florida on an evening not meant for fires.  Mysteriously there was a power outage due to a lighting strike at power plant in Fort Lauderdale when there were no storms in area, causing a massive blackout for the city.;26.267385;-80.271375
