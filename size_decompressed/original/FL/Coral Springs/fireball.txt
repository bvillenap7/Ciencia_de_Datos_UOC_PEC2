An orange colored comet flew through the night sky.;2015-03-12 23:00:00;5+ minutes;An orange colored comet flew through the night sky. While on my way home I needed to stop off at the grocery store.  As I turned north extremely high in the sky the most unusual fire orange color object moved in an eastern through the sky.  I have seen the orange colored objects twice before but this one was more comet shaped whith what I can only describe as a tail.  I was so amazed.  Before I could video the object I lost site of it in some cloud I guess.  But this thing appeared to get brighter and then dim out slightly.;26.267385;-80.271375
