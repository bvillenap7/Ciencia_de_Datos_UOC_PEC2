No lights on the object at all, just a white or metallic chevron or boomerang shaped object moving much quicker than any airplane could.   I stayed focused on the object for a while which was hard to make out against the dark sky even with all the light from the fireworks, because it seemed to be flying very high up.  It traveled in a large circle over and over and covered a good amount of space very quickly.  I finally lost sight of the craft.  Thousands of people there, SOMEBODY ELSE PLEASE TELL ME YOU SAW THIS AS WELL!!  Cool experience!;26.267385;-80.271375
