Orange Spheres flying over Coral Springs.;2012-11-09 21:30:00;2 minutes;Orange Spheres flying over Coral Springs My sister and I were going to the Coral Springs Country Club and were walking from the car in the parking lot to the front door. I looked up at the sky and noticed a round orange sphere coming from the Northeast and heading toward the Southwest.  It was flying at a higher altitude than the usual air traffic and it was flying pretty fast.   As it passed overhead it started flying faster and turned upward and disappeared from view.  My sister and I were both wondering what it was since it did not look like anything that we had ever seen flying in the sky. We came out of the country club a little over an hour later.  I again looked up at the sky and noticed that clouds had moved in.   As I looked toward the Northeast I noticed a round orange sphere (again!!) going toward the Southwest.  This time it was flying lower than the previous one that we had seen.  As it was coming towards us another orange sphere came up behind it.  It was probably a few miles behind it but it was following the same trajectory path as the one in front of it.   Both spheres flew into the clouds and disappeared from our view.;26.267385;-80.271375
