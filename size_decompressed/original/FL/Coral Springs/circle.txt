My roommate was on the patio investigating a cat fight when she called me out to check on it also.  As I was looking at the cats, she noticed two bright whitish circles dancing back and forth. She got my attention to look up as well, to make sure that what she was seeing was real.  As I looked up, I spotted them immediately as well.  We asked each other what it may be?  Both of us being in the airline business, we both knew that they were not any type of airplanes, helicopters, or weather balloons of any kind.  We watched as they danced around and then moved south for a short period of time then proceeded to head west finally disappearing into the night.  As they moved south and then west, they were still dancing with one another.  Kind of like they were playing with one another. The night was calm and clear and we have no other way to describe them other than ufo's.;26.267385;-80.271375
moving stars in the early night;2008-02-27 19:10:00;4 minutes;moving stars in the early night 7:10pm I was taking my son to the supermarket and as I always do I point up at the stars to him like planet Mars and Jupiter. I am an avid sky watcher so I know quite a bit about the night sky. I reguarly read Astronomy magazine and know what I am looking at and what to look for more than most. clear night with nothing blocking a nice view of the stars and planets and satalites above. I know a satalite when I see one as the spin and reflect the light of the sun as they go accross the sky. I know the space station as I point it out to my son early morning.  This is what my wife, my son and I saw:  As I was pointing out  the most visible of objects in the night sky like Mars we focused all of our attention on Mars it is clear as can be also very bright and red.  It was not moving at all as planets only can move as fast as the earth can spin.  Mars is what we really knew we were looking at.   Until it began to move in an od fassion from above to the North first slow almost un-noticable then abruptly it began an Easterly path for about 15 seconds slowly then rapidly began a southerly path before moving West then East again.  This is od very od planets, stars, satalites and Earthly airborn objects do not as we know yet move in this fassion yet.  The altitude of tje object apeared to be high so high it was mistaken orriginaly for Mars.  We all know Mars doesnt move from a stationary position above head directly to the North, East, South then West then East again.  The movement from each direction was abrupt and smooth with a clear scense of thought behind each action.  Nothing in nature can cause stars to move like this, planets or even satalite to move like this.   Again the motion was stationary directly overhead 30 seconds for argument sake then slow movement to the North 15 seconds then to the East abruptly 15 seconds then to the South abeuptly for 15 seconds then to the West abruptly foe 15 seconds then to the East again abruptly for 1 minute.  This one minute East path was the final direction of the object after that 1 minute East the object began to speed up first slowly picked up speed then faster and then faster then even faster appearing to move East and get higher in altitude until disapearing before our eyes not over the horizon but up up and out of sight.  No clouds to hide behind no other thing up in the sky to mistake it for.  This is what I saw my wife saw and my son who is very young saw.  But my wife and I are skepticle about UFO's due to the great distances needed to traverse in space-time.  This leads me to believe that what we saw was extraterestrial in its nature.  Since then I have kept my head up and looking and again the very next evening at 8:45 I looked at my watch first then to the sky and saw a simmilar object, this time same type of object as far as brightness and size was moving north for 30-40 seconds before moving West then speeding off West and increasing altitude and disapearing into the clear night.   Again the following night I look upward at around 9:15 and see a much brighter object as seen the two previous evenings.  This object was 10 times the luminosity also same type of motion just brighter.  Exactly the 3rd sighting goes like this I come home park the car and exit the vehicle.  I look up to admire the stars and I see clear as day a bright planet but this night it apears to have the luminosity of ten versus the previous two evenings this 3rd time the motion from up above to the north increasing altitude until disapearing.   Note none of the sightings did the objects disapear over the horizon rather disapeared into a higher altitude vanishing.  No sound ever.   And again I am an avid sky watcher and know what I am looking at and what for. This is what leads my skepticle mind to believe what I have been seing for three nights to be a clear ET Event.  I do think again if I look up I will see again soething that others with fancy equipment could video tape and verify.  I am an educated sky watcher and a skeptic due to the fantastic distances.   Make note of what I have seen please as the next person to see what I've seem won't think they are crazy. thank you kindly. S;26.267385;-80.271375

Orange shooting star seeing on the South Florida night sky;2009-03-24 04:36:00;1 min;Orange shooting star seeing on the South Florida night sky I was outside of my residence at about 4:36 AM on the morning of 03/24 when I observed an object on the sky that, at first, looked like a shooting star but something tells me that it was not. I originally observed an object that had a trail just like a shooting star but it was orange in color. The object was about 10-20 degrees NW of where I was. I continued to observe the object and after about 15-30 secs the trail went away and the object changed to a white color just like an airplane would look like. The object was traveling in a SE path, and once it reached to about east-southeast of where I was, I could no longer see it behind the clouds and houses.;26.267385;-80.271375

Coral Springs purple flying object.;2014-03-22 01:00:00;15;Coral Springs purple flying object. I was driving down the road and saw something moving in different directions very fast with no noise.  It was purple (violet) and would sometimes appear to turn blue.   All of a sudden it just disappeared in a flash.  I observed it along with police officers.   I tried a frequency counter to see if it was remote control but there was absolutely no signal to the tenth decimal.   I have a little move then a minute of it on video for proof.;26.267385;-80.271375

I ran into the house and got my cell phone and turned the cell so I could record the red circle objects in the sky.  I missed the first red circle object.  Then two more appeared from the same direction....they were close together and going up towards the black sky.  They floated high into the dark sky till I could not longer see them.  They faded away into the night.  It was not plane, balloon or chopper or drone.  Their was no sounds of any engines.  I got it on video on my cell.;26.267385;-80.271375
