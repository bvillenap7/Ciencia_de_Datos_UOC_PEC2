Green balls of light come from outdoors and enter house;1987-08-01 22:00:00;10 minutes;Green balls of light come from outdoors and enter house Was lying in bed one summer night when I was 16 (not asleep yet/not dreaming) and saw a big, bright green flash of light outside my window.  Our house was in the country on a dead end road so it was otherwise very dark.  Was about to get up and go to the window when a basketball-sized ball of green light came shooting through the window and then hovered up in one corner of my bedroom.  Then 3 smaller softball-sized light balls came out of the big one and started floating around my room.  One went toward my TV and was floating in front of it when the TV turned on and was all static for a few seconds and shut off.  Another ball floated to my bedside radio and it turned on as well for a couple of seconds of music and then went off.  The last ball of light went to the foot of my bed and then started slowly moving up towards my head, floating about 6 inches above me.  By the time it was right over my face I had the covers over my head and my eyes closed but could! still see the green light.  After a few seconds I chanced a peek and just then, very quickly, the little balls shot back into the bigger one and the big one shot out the window, followed by another large green flash.  I got out of bed and looked into the yard but saw nothing.  Went outside with a flashlight but there was no evidence in the yard.   This happened very quickly, only a few minutes total.  And besides the TV and radio coming on, it was completely silent.;30.2048366666667;-83.0199566666667
