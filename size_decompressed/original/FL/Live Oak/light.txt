This is the first UFO I saw.I am lucky enough to have seen two.Me and my wife were traveling to Louisiana to see my Daughter and grand kids.It was around 1 or 2 am on hwy10.Exactly where we were at I didnt notice.We were to busy talking about what we saw.I was driving along and noticed these lights coming for my right and about a mile away.As I got closer they were crossing hwy10 and I drove under them just as they were above the trees to my left.I looked out the window and tried to see under them but they were flying so low that they almost touched the tree tops only maybe 50 or less above them and disapeared above the trees.They were 6 lights with 3 each in the shape of a triangle but kind of out of shape not perfectly triangle.They were green like the light on my computer not bright.No sound with the speed of a helicopter;30.2048366666667;-83.0199566666667
