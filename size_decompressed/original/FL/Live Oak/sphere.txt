This beautiful orb was about the size of a baseball and looked like Venus or Saturn or Mars only much larger. I jumped out of my car to get a better view, and watched for a few moments. Suddenly the glowing orb made a quick jut to the left and then back to the right again, and stood there for a few more seconds. All of a sudden another orb indentilcal to this one zipped into view right besides the first orb. I watched in astonishment as these magnificent amber colored star-like orbs rocked and moved in direct opposite distances from each other, like a dance. Then suddenly the orb that appeared after the first orb shot away into the night sky and out of sight. I ran into the house to call my family to come outside to see this awesome sight, but when we all ran back outside, to my utter dissapointment, both orbs were gone! These glowing star-like orbs moved much faster then shooting stars and were much larger in size than any planet in the night sky!! Their movements were short and quick, and they could stand motionless for at least a minute at a time. Never in my enitre life have I seen anything like this! It was indeed something just like something out of this world.;30.2048366666667;-83.0199566666667

Then a third one came from the south, and was MUCH closer, and then followed the other two north.   I am confident they were not planes helicopters or drones.;30.2048366666667;-83.0199566666667
