12 glowing orange colored UFO sighting over Boynton Beach Florida;2012-03-23 21:10:00;5 minutes;12 glowing orange colored UFO sighting over Boynton Beach Florida Approximately 12 objects that appeared with a light looking like a glow of a flame. Initially we thought firework residue and realized they were not moving at first from our angle. Next we thought they were airplanes but discarded that notion due to the closeness and amount in same area. They appeared to be moving and we drove closer and as we did the lights went out on them one by one. As we were almost directly under them we could still see a few with lights on and when they burned out we were able to see them traveling because the sky was not that dark tonight. They were traveling from southeast to northwest direction. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237
Circular cloud.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible thermal rising into solid cloud.  PD));2013-08-03 17:15:00;10 minutes;Circular cloud I was driving along Federal Highway northbound in Boynton Beach, Florida,  after leaving work. I looked out my car window to the west and witnessed a very strange cloud formation that I can't imagine how it can be natural.   It cleared over the course of about 10 minutes.  I am wondering if something circular left the atmosphere from this point or if there might be some other possible abnormal explanation. ((NUFORC Note:  Photo shows a circular hole in light cloud.  May be the result of a thermal, rising into almost solid cloud overhead.  PD));26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237
