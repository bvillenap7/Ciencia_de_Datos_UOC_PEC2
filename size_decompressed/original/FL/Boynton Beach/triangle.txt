Large white trident shape craft with flowing wispy undulating tail seen in sky south florida, boynton beach on 09/23/08.;2008-09-23 20:15:00;30 seconds;Large white trident shape craft with flowing wispy undulating tail seen in sky south florida, boynton beach on 09/23/08. My mother and I were by the canal out back around 8:15 eastern time in boynton beach, fl, standing there talking and it was dusk out but the sky was still clearly visible and I looked up to the east & saw a white cloud colored iridescent long triangle/wedge like shape in the sky moving south-west very quickly and it was totally silent.   At first we thought it might be a giant plane but as it came into clear view from the side we realized it definitely was not, it was much larger and there were no lights or blinking lights whatsoever on it, zero lights.  The rear seemed to undulate or flow energy like a jellyfish or chinese kite flapping in the back, almost like it was a wispy celestial body and semi-transparent but still with very defined edges overall.  For some reason I want to say it looked spirit like or partially organic.  It was very wide from the back view as it cruised off into the distance and from the rear seemed like a long white or pearly line gliding along off into the sky heading southward towards delray beach.  It moved very straight & level and much faster than any tiny distant blinking planes did that were far off in the west sky shortly after that we used for comparison.   Our neighbor also came outside halfway through our sighting and clearly saw the craft/object as it went off into the distance and could'nt believe his eyes and agreed it was not anything he had ever seen before.  I am absolutely sure it was not a plane, bird, or a cloud and we were completely sober and I have 20/20 vision, trust me when I tell you this was something very strange.  It was very clear in the sky about half way up and lasted about 30 seconds total and we still can't believe what we saw really but I felt the need to report it in case others witnessed it as well in south florida over the caloosa park area on 9/23/08.  Please report it if you did.;26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237

Rounded triangle with red, green, and blue lights.;2015-03-03 20:37:00;2 1/2 minutes;Rounded triangle with red, green, and blue lights. I was walking out of my community club house, and when I got to the main sidewalk, I got the chills.  All the hair on my arms and legs rose up.  I then notice only what I can describe as a electrical hum.   I immediately looked up and that is when I saw it.  The black craft had to only be about two thousand feet in the air.  There was eight lights in total on it.  Three green light on one side, three red lights on the other side, and two blue lights on the back. There is a big communications tower real close.   At first I froze because I got scared, then I fumbled for my phone.  Once I got my phone out I thought I started recording.  At this point I'm looking due west.   I believe it noticed the light being projected from my phone and it started moving in a tight three hundred and sixty degree circle three times then headed slowly east south east at the same altitude.  This lasted about two and a half minutes before it disappeared behind the townhomes.  I went to view the amazing footage I filmed and I never hit record;26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237

((anonymous report));2016-05-29 21:17:00;1 hour;Triangle like formation of 4 circles that appears to get dim then light up as it disappeared and reappeared in the sky Was sitting out back with family, when suddenly one of us saw what appeared to be a triangle like formation of stars in the sky.  As we all looked we could see it brighter than any star that was out.   We watched it for a good hour and it would get very dim then suddenly light up and produce a glare.  It disappeared for about a minute then came back and appeared glowing.   It was higher than any plane and did not appear to be a star.
