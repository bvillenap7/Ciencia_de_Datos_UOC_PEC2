Strange, round object seen against a very clear blue sky in the middle of the day.;2005-07-15 14:00:00;5 seconds;Strange, round object seen against a very clear blue sky in the middle of the day. My cousin and I (both in our 60s) were reclining in pool chairs, relaxing and talking.  We both saw the object at the same time, directly overhead.  It appeared about the size of the moon when it is overhead.   The sky was very clear with a few light clouds to the northwest of us but none overhead.  They were the kind of clouds that you see at about 5000-6000 feet altitude.   The object was featureless and appeared one-dimensional.  Its color was grayish.  The effect was almost like the blue sky had a hole in it with an absence of color.  The object was moving quickly and silently from directly overhead (when we first saw it) to the northwest.  As it moved away from us it appeared smaller and smaller, like it would if it was getting further away.   It traveled underneath one cloud and as it did, the trailing edge turned bright glowing red.  It then traveled above the next cloud and disappeared from our view.  When last seen it looked to be only 20 percent of it's original size, which I thought was because it was rapidly climbing and getting further away.  Taking into consideration that it was at about 5500 feet in altitude when we last saw it, it was probably at about 1000-1500 feet in altitude when we first saw it.  I can't estimate how fast it was traveling, but it was a lot faster than the jetliners which regularly fly over from the nearby international airport.

A bright red orange circle in the sky.;2016-11-19 19:00:00;1.5 minutes;A bright red orange circle in the sky. We were walking our dog  in Boynton Beach, Florida, around 7:00 pm when we saw this strange round red orange object moving low in the sky .  It caught our attention because it was flying low.  We were very concerned because it didn't look like an airplane or helicopter in the night  sky and it was very quiet.  It was traveling from north to south on the eastern sky about a minute and a half. Suddenly, it went up high in the sky and form an  interesting shape.  The shape looked to us like a waxing crescent moon with the red orange ball in the center and white lights above and below the circle forming  the crescent moon and then it disappeared.  We were not the only ones watching.  Some of our neighbors were out there too.  Interesting sight !;26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237
