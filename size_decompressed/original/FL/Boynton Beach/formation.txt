V shape formation of very bright lights flew by at incredible speed.;2019-10-06 23:00:00;1-2 seconds;V shape formation of very bright lights flew by at incredible speed. I was outside looking at stars with my mother for a couple of hours last night.  I saw what appeared to be 10-20 very bright lights that flew by in a very distinct V shape formation that was only visible for a second or two.  These lights were brighter than the brightest visible stars in the sky that night (Vega, Capella).  They flew by so fast, I could not count how many lights there were exactly.  Possible Phoenix Lights?  I love star gazing and I see meteors and meteor showers often.  This was nothing like I have ever seen before. The sighting made me jump from my chair in shock.  There was no sound and no time to react to record a video.  Although I did not see an object, the lights were distinct enough that I will remember this sighting forever.;26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237
