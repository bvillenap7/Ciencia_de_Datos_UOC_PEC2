Two Fire Torches in the Sky in Boynton Beach, FL;2014-10-19 23:00:00;10 minutes;Two Fire Torches in the Sky in Boynton Beach, FL Was driving south on Jog (north of Atlantic Ave...near Oriole Rd).  Saw TWO (2) things.  Too slow for airplanes.  They were traveling west.  Was looking for red/green on plane, but as they got closer, I saw what looked like TORCHES in the sky.  Like torches used in the olympics.  It looked like fire in the sky.  Bigger than airplanes.  Fairly close to one another.  I stopped the car and just watched.  Couldn't believe what I was seeing.  Scary, but cool at the same time. I am of sound mind, highly educated, and didn't believe in UFOs.  But this was definitely something that I don't understand what I saw.  Did anyone else ever see fire torches in the sky that move slower than planes.  They also hovered at one point and then moved on.;26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237
Silent, orange ball of fire seen in the sky over Boynton Beach, FL - HAVE VIDEO AND PICTURE.;2015-03-28 21:18:00;3 minutes;Silent, orange ball of fire seen in the sky over Boynton Beach, FL - HAVE VIDEO AND PICTURE. I was sitting with my parents on their back porch and my dad pointed out a strange object in the sky.  We all walked out further into the yard to get a better look, and I immediately took a picture, and then started recording it on my phone.  The object looked like an orange ball of fire.  At first my dad thought an airplane was on fire, but then pointed out there was absolutely no noise coming from it at all.  It moved very slowly in our direction and wasn't making any erratic movements.  Once it passed overhead it quickly ascended (not lightening bolt fast, but just a relatively hurried steady pace) and the light became dimmer, until we finally lost sight of it.   I can provide the picture and video I took upon request.;26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237
