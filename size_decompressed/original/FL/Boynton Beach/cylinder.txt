We were 3 friends and only two saw the aprox. 4 objects (my friend visiting from England saw it). Nobody else in the boat was able to match this sighting. Shape and color: red circles or spheres. The objects looked small and far away to the naked eye. At one point they were motionless, but suddenly moved so rapidly and randomly that it made it impossible to think that it could be some kind of known aircraft, because inertia could hurt the pilot, so sharply they moved when they did. The objects dissapeared for a while and then were back and repeated a similar pattern. I and the other observer are colleage-educated professionals. I have experience in the sea. We were puzzled. We were positive that is was not a searchlight or lasser nor anything that could make sense to us or to suggest that it was being proyected from the coast or another ship. At one point they were gone and we were not able to see them again. I indeed saw it and did not report it before because I thought lots of people had to have seen it and reported it. REGARDING DATE OF EVENT: SORRY DO NOT REMEMBER IT EXACTLY. MAYBE MY FRIEND DOES. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237
