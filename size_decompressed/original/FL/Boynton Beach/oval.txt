I had seen 6 bright orange round objects.  The first was leading with 2 directly behind it on each side.  The other 3 were by themselves behind the first 3.   One of the 3 that were behind shot off towards the beach..  They were coming from the north to south.  They all vanished instantly after about 15-30 seconds.;26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237
