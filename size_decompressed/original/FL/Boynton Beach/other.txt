UFO Pictures;1994-10-08 13:00:00;Fast;UFO Pictures I was young and had a camera. I was in my parents yard. When I looked up I noticed this crazy shape flying in the sky.  So I took a few photos.  After that I don't remember much. I'm not saying I was taken or anything.  I think it was because I was young.  All I remember after the picture was saying, Damn, it's gone.   Today I was looking through some old boxes and came across one with photos.   As I was going down memory lane I came across the picture.   I feel that since it was not taken with a digital camera and I may still have the negative it would be more real since it can't be manipulated. I have the pictures here but am kind of freaked out. I don't know what to do with it. I always here about people having something worth money and then just loosing out on a goldmine.  I don't care about fame but I am starting a family.  I have the pictures and would like to know if there is anyone I can show them to to get an opinion.   Thanks for all your time.;26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237
Unusual light formation moving extremely fast across the sky.;2000-10-10 06:15:00;10 seconds;Unusual light formation moving extremely fast across the sky. Between 6:15 and 6:30 on the morning of October 10, 2000 my wife and I were walking our tow pekingnese dogs.  We live about a quarter of a mile from the ocean.  It was dardk and the sky was very clear.  As i looked up in the sky toward the east I saw five lights in a formation.   There were three lights in front in the shape of an arrow head and two lights in the back.  I can't estimate its size, I could not tell how high it was.  I watched it for about five to ten seconds before it dissapeared.  If I had to guess its size I would say it was about the size of a 747 airplane. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this individual, and we found his story to be quite convincing.  He sounds like a responsible individual, and he seemed quite serious about his sighting.  He said that he had never seen a UFO before this event.  PD));26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237
45 degree angled straight line of 3 dim lights with hazy aura between  with no sound observed flying from north to south at 1000 ft .;2000-10-18 20:25:00;10 seconds;45 degree angled straight line of 3 dim lights with hazy aura between  with no sound observed flying from north to south at 1000 ft . On 10/18/00 at approximately 2025 hrs my 14 yoa son and I were trying to find planetary objects to look at with our telescope.  I had just walked to the (front) southeast corner of the house trying to find the moon.  As I was walking back to the northeast side of the house I was facing east when I saw three dim white lights in a straight line of a 45 degree angle equally spaced and without any sound fly from north to south above the houses across the street no more than a 1000 feet above ground level.  I shouted to my son (his name and) Look! Both of us observed and described the same thing to include that as we watched this object we observed between the three dim lights a fuzziness or blurring as if the three lights were connected but the connecting material was not possible to be clearly discerned.  This all took place in no more than 10 seconds.  The object(s) then suddenly vanished.  I am a ((profession deleted--public servant)) and ((military title))  who flew ((deleted--100+)) combat missions out of southeast asia with a top secret clearance at the time.  I would not mind being contacted about this but I will not allow my name or the name of my son or family to be publicly identified.  There is a small airport (Lantana) within 3-4 miles of our house to the northeast and we did notice one or two discernable aircraft lights at a distance that night in the area of the airport but not apparently involved in this incident.;26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237
Flying wing like UFO siting in on 10/30/02 at 11:37pm in Boynton Bch FLA;2002-10-30 23:37:00;8 seconds;Flying wing like UFO siting in on 10/30/02 at 11:37pm in Boynton Bch FLA I am a marine bio major in college, work full days outside at a golf couse and because of that understand the sky. I was casually looking at orions belt in my backyard at 11:37 pm in boynton beach FLA.  Conditions were very clear, Orions belt was low, ~18 degrees above the horizon,quiet, relatively dark.  I have a relatively open view of the horizon looking East but north and south are restricted a bit, I was looking east. I am about 1.1 miles east of the Atlantic ocean.  I was about half way there at a 15 degree angle, trigonometry says I was ~half a mile away from a slow constant moving object~180 mph heading north to south (simular to the one videoed in Arizona in the late nineties) catches my eye (probaly 3 degrees below orions belt).  Boomerang or wing-like with definantly no tail(NOT A B-2),large ~wing span 120 ft or larger, width ~25 ft, nose to tail ~60 feet.   At the tips the wings were 25 ft horizontally wide and seemed to gain slight girth in the center behind the wings.9-11 large ovular lights on outer edges.  3 on the front of each wing, 1 on nose, 1 on each back of wing. Most Shocking,No noise at all!  Too low to not make a noise, flying less then 4000ft.  If there was a noise to here I would have heard it.  Overall I saw the object for 7-8 seconds.  Unfortunantly, between being stunned and not having time, I have no hard evidence.;26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237
Pre dawn looking up in sky I see a light moving south west over the coast at very high speed no sound I looked away to adjust my sight;2019-12-14 06:04:00;4 minutes;Pre dawn looking up in sky I see a light moving south west over the coast at very high speed no sound I looked away to adjust my sight then back up and see a line of the same size circle shaped objects moving south west spaced apart about 200 ft then a a closer group of two closer together about 100ft all together about 22 of them. I have seen a single shaped same size and speed moving from north to south down the coast other nights. I live on the coast so itâ€™s a little easier to see night sky. What is very unsettling is the speed and heading of these objects. I have seen shooting stars,satalites these objects are not those.;26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237
