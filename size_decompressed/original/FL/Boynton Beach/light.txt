While looking at the stars I saw strange light activity;2007-02-02 00:00:00;5 seconds;While looking at the stars I saw strange light activity It was around 5 am and as I looked up at the sky I saw a bright light.  At first I thought it was a shooting star but shooting stars have a long tail as it enters the atmosphere.  The object that I was looking at was bright and all of the sudden this object split into two bright lights and dimmed at exactly the same time and seemed to have vanished but that wasnt it, there was another object that appeared as soon as the lights split.  It came from between the burst of light and traveled straight.  I doubt that it was a plane because I have never seen a plane travel that fast and I am for sure that this event did not occur in the earths atmosphere.  I've seen this object in the sky for many years and I've been following it but this is the first time I've seen it do this.  All I know about this object is a very light blue color and that it seems to flee from the sunlight and it moves faster than anything on earth and it's brightness is so dim that you can barely see it but if you look at the sky closely it's always there and I usually see this object between 4 and 5:30 before sunrise.  It seems that I can sense it for some reason because I can look at the night sky and tell you exactly where it's at.  Ive shown plenty of people but they havent been able to explain it either.;26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237
 a ufo was orbiting mars!!!  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));2007-02-10 08:00:00;30seconds;a ufo was orbiting mars!!! I was looking at mars with 1500mm dobsonian teloscope at abut 50 magnification when a dot of light approaches mars circles it once then it starts to slowly drift away from mars then it starts to get dimmer, and it dissapears you could not see it with the naked eye.  ive done astronomy for 8 years and it wasnt a star or a comet. the object did not take any aparent shape just a dot of light  i would have magnified it more, but i didnt for fear of loseing the object. the object did come from mars. what was that thing?

Stationary star like light twinkling many colors seen for 50 minutes.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus?  PD));2007-05-02 21:35:00;50 minutes;Stationary star like light twinkling many colors seen for 50 minutes I live west of Boynton Beach Florida near the Turnpike. On May 2, 2007, at 21:35 EST I noticed a star to the northwest sparkling brightly in many colors.  I lined it up in the frame of my screened porch and expected it to move like an aircraft or satellite would do.  It was a third of the way up between the horizon and straight up.  West of the big dipper.  It was not the brightest star out but twinkled rapidly.  Not like other stars out that night. It did not move. After five minutes I got two binoculars and my 10X zoom Minolta digital camera and got a clear look outside the screen enclosure. The camera will do digital zoom to 40x.  The videos are .MOV format and good quality.  I took a few pictures and videos with the camera.  The videos came out good. One photo is great showing the string of red, blue, green and yellow colors clearly.  It is a string as there is a time laps of a second.  Nothing I know of makes color shifts like that all within one second.  After fifteen minutes I called my neighbors and they saw it too.   At 22:25 EST it became unviewable as clouds came by.  I checked again at 22:55 and the sky was clear but it was gone. I am an ex military aviator and a good photographer and think this was an unusual long term sighting which lasted almost an hour.

pulsating light;2008-07-21 23:00:00;7min;pulsating light I was observeing the trifid nebula in the constellation sratigus with an antares 12inch dobsonian telescope when i caught sight of an object that was an orange color and what appeared to be orbiting the earth. It was very high up most likley out of the earths atnosphere. The object was pulsating to different magnitudes(brightness) and kept changing speeds. At one piont it atmitted a bright orange beam for about 3 seconds. About 2 minutes later, the object started to decrease altitude. As it was doing so, it started to get fainter and and started to pulsate brighter and then dissapeared. the object could not be seen with the naked eye or through the scopes 8x52 view finder. The lens i used to view the object was a plossl 1.25in 32mm with on the scope i was useing was about 50x. there was one more witness. My dad got a quick glimpse of the object. It had no visible shape. I know it wasnt a satellite or a meteor because satilites dont pulsate and the bject was goining to slow to be a meteor.;26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237
White light traveling at high altitude, maybe orbit - West to East.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellite??  PD));2009-07-18 05:19:00;2 minutes;White light traveling at high altitude, maybe orbit - West to East Light drifted from west to east and then out of sight. Very high altitude, orbit maybe. Moon was north of object. Object did not blink - straight white light.  Thought it may have been the shuttle, but when I checked NASA position, it was already docked and over Sudan at the time. It was an uncommonly clear sky which I am not used to, could have been satellite. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellite, we suspect, although the ISS was not visible from this location, on the date indicated by the witness.  PD));26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237
Strange light in Palm Beach County;2010-07-10 21:30:00;30-40 min;Strange light in Palm Beach County I was sitting on my patio having a cigarette when I noticed the brightest star I had ever seen.  The star was a bit strange because it didn’t seem to be moving, but every time I would look up it would be within a different proximity of a star which was to it’s left.   My co-worker was spending the night, so I called her out because I couldn’t believe what I was seeing and I needed witness.  I also called my grandmother.  They both looked at it and told me that it was a typical star, just bright.   My co-worker and I drove across the street to rent a movie.  We were only gone for about 5 to 10 min max.   I went back on the porch and the bright light was now much lower to the ground, but it was still in the west.   I immediately called my grandmother because this was the craziest thing that I’ve ever seen.  My grandmother went outside and said that it was unusual how low that star had gone.  She agreed that it couldn’t be a star or a plane because it had been stationary for extended periods of time.  My co- worker agreed that this was strange.  A few minutes after I called my grandmother to tell her that the light had moved, she called me to tell me that the light had completely disappeared.   I am wondering if there are any other reports on this same event.;26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237

3 orange round lights traveled north from the southwest making no sound and they stayed together.  Then 1 more appeared from same area.;2014-03-07 20:45:00;Less than 10 mins;3 orange round lights traveled north from the southwest making no sound and they stayed together.   Then 1 more appeared from same area followed by 2 more.  They seemed to hover while 4 more came single file from same southwest sky.   When they were together the original 3 stayed stationary while some of the others seemed to dance around them.  As quickly as they arrived so did they disappear.  Not by flying away but inside the lights each grew dimmer and dimmer until all were gone.   All of the objects were of the same bright orange color and there was no sound.;26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237
Orange light moves west, flickers, then takes off full speed out of sight.;2014-12-31 23:30:00;1 minute;Orange light moves west, flickers, then takes off full speed out of sight. As some friends and I were watching New Years fireworks, we noticed a lingering orange light.  My friend said it was a UFO that he has seen a few times before.  It slowly started moving west and after about thirty seconds of moving west, it flickered.  It flickered 5 times before taking off full speed out of our sight.  All of us were in shock and couldn't believe what we had just saw.;26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237
Light formed and then cloud formed around it dissapearing, appearing and then completely gone with tiny light going away.;2021-02-09 18:30:00;2 minutes;Light formed and then cloud formed around it dissapearing, appearing and then completely gone with tiny light going away. The light got brighter and had a cloud forming around it that got larger and looked like it was twisting around the light. The light started to get smaller and then the cloud sort of disappeared and then reappeared and then was completely gone.  My wife was walking my daughter on the other side of the complex and when she came back she stated she saw the same thing but in the opposite direction.  Mine was toward the northeast and hers was in the southwest. A tiny light looking like a star went away once the cloud dissapeared.;26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237
