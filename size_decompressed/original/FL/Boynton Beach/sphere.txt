Two metallic spheres moving west over then south over Boynton Beach;2012-11-17 15:10:00;30 seconds;Two metallic spheres moving west over then south over Boynton Beach Driving north on Congress Avenue about 1/2 mile south of Hypoluxo Blvd, I saw two spherical objects moving west through the sky. At first I thought they were small passenger planes from the local airfield, but didn't see any wings. They glinted in the sun, the same bare-metal color and reflection as a WWII Mustang fighter plane. My second thought was that they were party balloons flying thorugh the air. But as I got closer they appeared to be too big - about 10 feet in diameter. After passing over Congress Ave they continued on then turned south and kept going parallel with the street behind me. They disappeared behind the trees, and I turned around at Hypoluxo Blvd to go back south and try to catch them on my camera, but never saw them again. They were in view for perhaps 30 seconds, starkly visible against the bright blue sky and cumulous clouds. They appeared to be about 200-300 years away at the beginning, and maybe 50-75 yards up. They kept their formation the whole time, one higher and ahead of the other. I couldn't tell if it was directly in front of the other or not. I was in the car in traffic and heard no sound from the spheres. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237
2 glowing red spheres spaced 7 minutes apart traveling across Boynton Beach, FL.;2013-12-31 19:24:00;8 minutes;2 glowing red spheres spaced 7 minutes apart traveling across Boynton Beach Florida I am a business owner that works with 3D modeling, prototype design and architectural construction.   I was taking the greyhounds out after their dinner when I noticed a red glowing object.  First thought was fire works that are always launched around my neighborhood for New Years.   After capturing the video, I took the dogs back in and came back out to clean up when I noticed the second red object where I captured the second shorter video. First object was sited at 19:24 EST 12/31/13.  It was originally thought to be a firework launch but after 20-30 seconds it did not exhibit the signs that would be associated with a firework display.  Video capture was started with a Samsung Galaxy S3 and 87 seconds of video was captured as it traveled from the NE to the W from my vantage point. The object was spherical and had a red glow with no visible com trail or flashing strobe lights.  There was no turning or course changes and it maintain a constant travel speed as best as could be discerned from my vantage point. The second object was spotted 7 minutes later following the same visual line from the NE to the W.  The second object was captured on video for 52 seconds before being obscured by cloud cover. The second object looked just as the first one did, same visual speed and path with no course changes or discerning differences. Neither of the objects exhibited the fireball characteristics that I have seen in other videos though I do know from what I have read that we are passing through the tail debris of one of the comets we had running through our solar system this last year. I do not know what they were but would like to know.;26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237

Definitely not a plane, had no flashing lights.Wasn't a green fireball, ,plane or It's nighttime in Boynton beach Florida and while just driving home I saw a solid bright green, solid dot  object moving much much faster than a plane. There were no flashing lights and its color was very bright green. I first saw the object maybe 15 miles away?? I think it was coming from the northwest to the southeast.  It Definitely wasn't  a fireball. It couldn't have been a handheld drone because the object was MILES away from where I first saw it, until I lost sight. It definitely didn't fly on a path. It changed direction and appeared to go higher and lower compared to its flight pattern. There's an airport for only private planes in Boca Raton. The object may have been moving towards it, but it definitely wasn't a plane. I see private planes overhead all the time and can judge the speed of one. This object was RACING and maybe a little erratically at times. I know when planes are closer to you they appear faster but it just wasn't a plane. I'm about 20 miles from Palm Beach airport but the object wasn't anywhere near there. Nor was it coming or going in that direction. Can't believe I'm actually doing this but I'd love to know if anyone else saw it what I saw. I am absolutely aware that I was always curious about about ufos and have always looked as an amateur but I have never seen something like what I saw. Surely haven't seen something like it enough  to take 15 minutes to report it.;26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237
