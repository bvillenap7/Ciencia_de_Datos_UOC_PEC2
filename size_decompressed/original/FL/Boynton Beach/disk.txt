Object landed in Boyton Beach Florida.;2007-03-03 16:50:00;1 minute;Object landed in Boyton Beach Florida. When driving I saw a object that looked like a disk landing just a half mile north, in residential or field area.   The duration of this was about 1 minute I saw no lights or propellers so I could not have been a plane.   This object was black and I could not tell the length.   Another reason I knew it was not a plane was that there was no airport near that area.   I heard no sound, herd nothing on the news that night, there was no trail, no changing of color, nothing.   Just black disk. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));26.5261653429602;-80.1114407942237
