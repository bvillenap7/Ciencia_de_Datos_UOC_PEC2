Blue fireball falling disappears before reaching horizon;2009-06-07 02:00:00;2-3 seconds;Blue fireball falling disappears before reaching horizon I was driving north of Highway 41 entering southern Brooksville.  I saw a large, bright blue fireball fall straight from the sky in the distance to the north.  It disappeared BEFORE reaching the horizon like comet fading.  However, this thing moved much slower and was much bigger than a comet.  It looked like space debris but it was too large and moved too fast. It just looked... unnatural.  I've seen many comets and seen space debris but this was somewhere... in between.  The people driving in the next lane over were both pointing and looking in that direction afterwards... I'm sure one of them saw it too. It wasn't messy like a fireball, but more like a perfect blue sphere.  No trail.;28.5586557873484;-82.423991991924
