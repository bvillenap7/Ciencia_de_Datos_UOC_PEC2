I decided to go outside to look at it more clearly and it was moving up and down, side to side and then disappeared and reappeared.  It than began to change shapes and luminate several colors. This object was in my view for over 15 minutes.  I videotaped the object in the sky for approximately 2 to 3 minutes and have some still pictures. The video is posted on utube under ufo122611. The video file is to large to submit by email , but we will forward the still photo shots.;28.5586557873484;-82.423991991924
