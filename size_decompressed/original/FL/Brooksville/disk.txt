Upclose saucer experience;1976-06-30 23:00:00;1 minute;Upclose saucer experience At night on golfcourse with my girlfriend. We heard a hum and when we looked up it came right over a big oak tree, right over our heads. It was very close. I continued in a straight line until it was out of sight. It was an unbelievable experience. There was a number of sightings called into the radio station that same night which is the only thing that saved our face among friends. We have no pictures. I am now able to come forth and I want to get this info out as much as possible. It was so close that there is not doubt what we saw. I am now 50 years old and in the medical profession. My risk of family, friends and job did not allow me to come forward in an aggressive manner before. I feel that this information needs to be known. I have reported this to Mufon.;28.5586557873484;-82.423991991924
