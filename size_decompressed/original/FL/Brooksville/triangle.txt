I was on my way to work around 4:45 am this morning on the suncoast parkway and much of the parkway is pitch black through Pasco and Hernando counties.   Out of nowhere these lights appeared through the fog and circulated slowly for a good 20-30 seconds, enough for me to get a picture and stare, as I'm in shock, and then very quickly they shot straight up out of the fog as the lit up sky dimmed quickly and returned to darkness in the picture I provided  The guy on the highway to the right slammed on his brakes as I slowed down to try to believe what I was actually seeing!  I was going to call the police but with things I have read they will think I'm crazy or not believe it and try to tell me it was an aircraft since I was close to a industrial airport that only has small aircraft take off from along with helicopters.   These crafts moved a lot faster than the fighter jets we have when they left and circulated in formationâ€¦;28.5586557873484;-82.423991991924
