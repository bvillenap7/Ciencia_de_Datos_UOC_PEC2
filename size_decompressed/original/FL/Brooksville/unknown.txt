Streak across sky later. 5:45 p.m. Hernando-Sumter County, FL - Heading North on I75 from Tampa. Straight road ahead of me and a very clear sky entering twilight. Through my windshield, up ahead I saw what I thought was a jumbo jet in the sky.  It was metallic and very reflective.  Larger than normal.  I didn't notice it moving in any direction so I assumed it was going straight ahead or away from me. It was in my sight for a good 10 seconds and I noticed something looked a little weird.  I reached over to my radio to turn down the volume, momentarily taking my eyes off the road and the object, and the object was gone!  At first I thought it merely changed direction and stopped reflecting the sun.  But upon closer inspection it was simply gone.  There was no way it flew out of my line of sight because there was nowhere the object could've went to.  It was a clear twilight sky on a straight highway!  I immediately called my girlfriend to explain the whole thing.  During the conversation, for a moment, I clearly saw a streak going up and to the west. That's it!  This is the second time I witnessed a UFO!  Check out the nuforc link to read it:  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/039/S39742.html Since THAT sighting, I may have lost a little sanity but my vision has improved.  It never hurts to double check the sky!  This wasn't a case of me wanting to see something.  I didn't even conceive it might be a UFO until the very last moments. The strange thing is that it disappeared the moment I got this strange sensation that something was amiss (probably influence from my previous sighting years ago).  Then it was gone!  30 seconds later I'm on my cell phone and I saw a streak in the sky (extremely fast.  Hardly perceptible). I'm not sure what else to say.  So I guess that's it.  Keep looking up!;28.5586557873484;-82.423991991924

The sky was clear.  I noticed a set of bright, elongated lights moving from west to east over Ayers Rd for about a half mile, then slowly turned to the north.  It did not seem to be that high, and was silent...no engine noise at all.;28.5586557873484;-82.423991991924
