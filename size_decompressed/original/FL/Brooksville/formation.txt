strange array of lights suddenly appear  about 1/2 mile in front of my truck, in Brooksville Florida.;2004-03-18 01:00:00;5 to 10 mins;strange array of lights suddenly appear  about 1/2 mile in front of my truck, in Brooksville Florida. I was traveling west on Ayers Rd, in Brooksville, Florida about 3 miles east of the RR crossing, I was the only vehicle on the road at the time, I had my cruise control set at 55MPH, had my hi-beams on, all of the sudden these red lights appeared on the road ahead of me about a half mile away,  it was very odd the pattern of red lights  didnt match any vehicle that I was familiar with. I first thought this is huge what ever it is, it covered both lanes, about 30 ft wide and about 20 ft high with the one lone light on the other lane (east bound) was flashing.  As I got closer, I slowed down, turned off my high beams, I realized this moving  object is not a vehicle, I could see the trucks passing north and south on US41 through the lights, all of the sudden as I got closer about 400 feet away these lights all vanished in different directions, and the red lights went off simuntaneously...as they scattered. this all lasted about 5 to 10 minutes.
