Huge soundless orangish/greenish hovering  ball of light that shoots out sparks.;1994-04-20 22:00:00;3 minutes;Huge soundless orangish/greenish hovering  ball of light that shoots out sparks. First let me start by saying that where we live is very rural.  The State forest is my front yard.  Not many homes and very little traffic.  There used to be a landfill but has since closed.  My brother and I were driving to the store for our mother to get a few items.  My brother was driving the car.  Heading to the west going over the top of the hill to the north we both noticed something hovering above the trees, at first it looked like a helicopter with a weird orangish with a hint of light greenish tinted spot light all lit up and blinding almost like a giant star but it didn't have any sound and it was hovering just above the trees.  The best way to describe it would to say that it look ed like an orange/green street light in the distance, but VERY bright and VERY big, too bright to make out what it looked like without the lights.  It stayed perfectly still and soundless until we got about 30 feet away from the trees where it was hovering.  When we got closer it shot off to the north east at record speed.  The object flew out further into the wooded area and disappeared.  The weirdest part about it was that it shot out sparks similar to a comets tail when it took off. My brother decided to try to chase it through the woods. On a trail going 40 to 50 miles an hour trying to catch this object it was impossible. I am very familiar with airplanes and helicopters and this was neither. I have never seen an object take off that fast with trailing sparks.

Wierd light spotted in Brooksville, Florida  ((NUFORC Note:  Report is not inconsistent with a sighting of the star, Sirius.  PD));2005-01-20 01:15:00;20 mins.;Wierd light spotted in Brooksville, Florida On 01/20/2005, 1:15AM, I stepped outside to have a cigarette. Looking tpo the South  I saw what looked like a light that flashed many different colors. It appeared to be several miles away, and thot it to be an airplane or star. Being very familiar with astronomy and also seeing the heavy cloud cover, horizen to horizen, I knew this was interesting. As I watched it more closely I realized that it was wobbling up and down, side to side in small but definate movements. Also noticed it wasnt moving in a direction. It was stationary aside from the wobbling movements. This event lasted for at least two cigarettes, and I smoke 100's, and a few mins longer than that. I estimate 20 mins. or so. The light continued to flash many colors this entire time, and just before it vanished I noticed a shift in its position a couple of degrees against the tree line I was using as a reference. I'm very familiar with how things look in the sky at night and I have never seen anything behave like this before.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report is not inconsistent with a sighting of the star, Sirius.

Long string of 24+ equally spaced lights moving across the sky from North to South in Brooksville, FL.;2020-04-30 21:15:00;10;Long string of 24+ equally spaced lights moving across the sky from North to South in Brooksville, FL. I watched a string of lights, most equally spaced with two places where 2 were side by side movin from NNW toward SSE in perfect alignment . By the time I opened my iphone camera the only picture I got was of the last 4.  One leading and 2 together and the 4th made a triangle.  The moon was too bright and high in the sky to get a decent picture.  If there is an explanation of what these were I would welcome hearing back.;28.5586557873484;-82.423991991924
