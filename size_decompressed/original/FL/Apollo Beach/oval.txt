After watching for a few moments, I noticed that this cluster of round objects were stationary.  They were silent and grouped together hovering.  They were white and seemed to have light within them.   They began to move across the sky very slowly.  At times they seemed to vanished but would reappear seconds later.   I also noticed another object that looked more cylinder shaped, moving near the cluster of objects.  When the objects would fade away for a few seconds, the cylinder shaped object would still remain.  They slowly moved across the sky until I no longer could see them.  This lasted for approximately 10 minutes.  Not long after the objects left, a small airplane was circling the area.   Not sure what I witnessed, but very interesting.

I saw what I first thought to be a plane, however, I quickly realized that it had no exterior parts. I t was high up in the sky, very shiny metallic material, oval/ pill/tic-tack shaped and vertical.  It appeared to be hovering. One minute it was there, the next it was gone without any sign of propulsion.  It was mostly sunny and the craft was against the blue sky, somewhat near clouds.;27.7731;-82.4088000000001
