Craft moving from north to south.;2015-11-26 22:15:00;15 seconds;Craft moving from north to south. I am a bio engineer, currently working on a US Army contract.  I say this to ensure my credibility.   My daughter, her 2 friends, and myself all witnessed a craft that is unexplainable.  It can be described as what first looked like a Chinese lantern, but after a few seconds, it became apparent it was not.  It was orange in color, moving at a very high rate of speed, from north to south, with a slight zig zag motion.   We watched it for about 12 to 15 seconds, and then it vanished.  It was about 10:15 at night.   Without question, it was not a satellite, meteor, plane, balloon or anything I've ever seen in videos or in person.  This was, without a doubt, a controlled craft of some sort.;27.7731;-82.4088000000001
Reddish-orange round ball of light flying over Apollo Beach.;2016-11-19 22:00:00;30 seconds;Reddish-orange round ball of light flying over Apollo Beach Red-orange light almost hovering over Apollo Beach, then takes off into the clouds. Has returned twice within 20 min.   No noise associated with light, and it doesn't follow the normal aircraft flight profile over Apollo Beach.

25+ lights in formation, Heading north East.   ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-22 06:05:00;4min;25+ lights in formation, Heading north East. Took dogs out and looked up at sky like I always do, Saw 25 lights in formation go north East of Mcdill AFB, coming south west as if coming from Central America direction, they looked like a regular star, but moving all in a formation, twice I counted two of them together close, but the rest were spaced apart, could of been satellites or aircraft, but even planes flash lights, these did not flash, looked exactly as youâ€™d see a star in the night sky,  but moving in a line, I counted to 25, but do not know how many were going over before I got outside.;27.7731;-82.4088000000001
