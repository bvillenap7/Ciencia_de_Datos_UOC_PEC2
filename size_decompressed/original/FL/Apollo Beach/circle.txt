As I was looking at it fly by, it had came to a complete stop in the air and sat there.  While looking at it, it went from a green ball to being  a bright white light.  As I was driving past the object it appeared  to have a white dome shape and flat at the bottom.  It also appeared to be flashing white lights like a strobe light.  After about 10 minutes, I lost sight of it.;27.7731;-82.4088000000001
