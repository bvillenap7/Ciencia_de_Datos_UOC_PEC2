I was sitting on my deck at about 06:20 drinking my coffee. I was looking up at a cloud formation and, from the corner of my left eye, saw something move in the sky. I followed it across the sky as it moved from South to North. It was chevron shaped, whitish in color. I looked to see if there was something solid looking between the two sides of the chevron, but there wasn’t. There was no sound, no lights, and no trail. If I wasn’t looking up, I would not have seen it. I became very frightened.  Observer background: I am a retired U.S. Government professional, 70 years of age. I have never knowingly seen a UFO before.;27.7731;-82.4088000000001
