The scene was a warm humid Florida night overlooking a wetland and a starry sky above.  We were out during the perseids meteor shower and in the near distance was a huge storm head with amazing heat lightning erupting in and around it. While fixing our eyes on the both the shooting stars and the storm we noticed a reddish orange flickering light at the edge of the clouds.   At first it was believed to be a star or an airplane and then after many flashes of lightning we saw that it was definitely in the sky alongside the storm but appeared to be hovering in place.  It continued to move back and forth and kind of in a small circle. We arenâ€™t sure if the flashing of the storm was playing tricks on us. The reddish orange light attached to what appeared to be an air-craft of some kind hovered in place for a half hr after midnight and then was gone.
