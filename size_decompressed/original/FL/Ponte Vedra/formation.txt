Saw 10 oblong objects high in the air making different formations.  It was the middle of the day in a partly cloudy blue sky.  The objects would reflect the sun similar to a metallic object.  They made several different formations including a straight line and a perfect triangle.  Appeared to be hovering and then speed off much more quickly than any airplane ever seen.  There were no sounds or contrails. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));30.11730625;-81.4108750000001
