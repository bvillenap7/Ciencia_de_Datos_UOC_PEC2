Fast moving yellow cigar shaped fireball over heavily wooded area.;1997-06-15 22:00:00;5 seconds;Fast moving yellow cigar shaped fireball over heavily wooded area. Sighted over the heavily wood area beind my house around midnight.  I live in a dark area.  It raced over most of the trees but behind the tallest pine which must be 100+ feet(i guess).  It was a bright pale yellow streak probably about fifty feel long with the front half being the brightest.  Compared to a full moon, its diamenter was slightly less than the moon. The back half was like a blur, like a comets tail.  More cigar shaped than round at the brightest point in the front.   It flew south to north horizontal with the horizion. I was looking to the west. It flew very fast, jet like speed. It was silent.  I was seventeen and the other witness was fifteen. After the very quick event, both me and my friend looked at eachother and then ran into my house. We both had tears running down our face. it was intence. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));30.11730625;-81.4108750000001
