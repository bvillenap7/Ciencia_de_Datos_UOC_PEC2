Saw a large light in the sky that seemed to have things coming off of it, then vanished out of the sky.;2012-01-19 19:45:00;5 mins;Saw a large light in the sky that seemed to have things coming off of it, then vanished out of the sky. Was walking outside with my dad at 19:45 and noticed a bright orange circle in the sky resembling a planet, but it was much too bright to be a planet.  I call my father over to view the bright light in the sky, and during the whole time the light was moving, very sluggishly, as if it was plane.  During the whole encounter it appeared things were being dropped off, or things coming off of the UFO.   The UFO moved in the sky for a bit, and then me and my father watched the light blink out of the sky, disappearing from where it was.   It was viewed in the E-NE sky from our vantage. A rough description of how it blinked out:  in human terms it looked like a ball with lights on one side spinning to the side with no lights on, like a gradual circular fading.
