Bright lights over I4 just before exit 14.;2011-09-18 03:45:00;5 minutes;Bright lights over I4 just before exit 14. At about 3:45 AM on 09/18/2011 my 17-year-old son, and 2 other adult friends and I were heading west towards Tampa on I4.   About 3 miles before the Macintosh exit we noticed a bright light just hovering over the road and off to the right of it.  As we got closer, we noticed there was no sound. And as we were almost under it we then noticed there were two other nights to it, making it a triangle shape.  Because I was driving I could no get a good look like they could.  So I turned on my flashers and pulled off of the road.   Once I did that.  And started getting out of my car to get a better look and a possible picture.  The “Lights” took off!   I didn’t even have enough time to turn on my camera.  It was completely out of sight before I was even all the way out of my car.;28.0635;-82.3086
