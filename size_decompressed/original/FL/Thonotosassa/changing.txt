Star-like two crafts unable to start car.;2014-11-04 04:00:00;current;Star-like two crafts unable to start car. My dogs woke me up, barking like crazy...I waited til they calmed down and took them for a walk on our 6 acre property and observed two star like craft east of property one larger pulsating moving slowy sometimes just hovering they are over a huge field...my dogs started barking one ran towards the back of the property towards the crafts....so I tried to turn my headlights on my car so I could see where she went and I had to start my car so I could move my car a bit glare the lights towads the back of my property and my car would not start it tried I got it started enough to turn the headlights towards where I wanted to see and then my car went dead and I started rolling back and my breaks wouldnt work it felt weird my other dog is leashed near my car so I am trying to stop it before my car rolls back on him...I flash the lights towards my dog in the back and I notice there are two crafts one smaller and the other larger then it seemed to change shape the lig! ht and color...was really weird and I ran back to the house..it was around 345am.....I have seen these same two crafts before last June and really freaked me out because last time I took a pic but it was blurry and my sis told me to use her binoculars and I saw exactly what it was sideways at first cylindrical was disc coming off side ways from the other starlight craft and the it turned very slowly coming off the other craft and then I could see it was a disk and the bottom was covered with catacomb shaped lights... and It was there for a while that time and I tried to send a report that time via my kindle and my kindle started messing up the screen was crooked and shaking like an old analog tv so it totally freaked me out...this time the car not starting scared the bejesus out of me to say the least.  we are located in a rural area. I want to go take pics but LOL I am way to freaked out.;28.0635;-82.3086
