3 purple/white objects , fast no sound 1000ft , against black sky around midnight electrical dist in  truck;2004-11-24 00:00:00;approx 2 minutes;3 purple/white objects , fast no sound 1000ft , against black sky around midnight electrical dist in  truck Working inside a field in Wintergarden Florida aprox Midnight four of us were finishing up field work. As we approached the exit gate to the field we noticed  approx three objects in the sky. The sky was extremely black closest buildings to the field had to be at least 5 miles or so away in any direction. The objects were moving extremely quick with a burst of purplish - white light. The objects started out kind of ball shaped as they passed us they flattened out a bit. There was a quiet humming sound in the air as they passed us but hardly loud enough to hear. They must have been about maybe 1,000 feet up I guess. they flew out and up and then vanished against the black sky, everyone that saw it with me asked everyone else if they saw the same thing , everyone was a little weirded out to say the least , but the objects never stopped , but the fact  that sound was almost nothing really worked us up . It was pretty exciting to all of us. Im only 18 years old , and what I saw was not a joke , was not some Goverment thing , what I saw, waht we saw looked like something just passing through. The weirdest thing that happened was our radio got fuzzy and the truck seemed to was to go faster then slower then no where as the objects passed over;28.5273999999999;-81.6011999999998
two color changing orbs in the sky;2011-06-11 22:00:00;20 min;two color changing orbs in the sky I was walking my father out to his car when i saw a bright green ball in the sky. It was several times brighter than the obvious airplanes in the sky, and it wasn't moving in a straight line.. it would hover, zigzag/dance, and at times drop and rise like an elevator. At one point it shot across the sky and changed its position completely. Not only did it change color from green, to blue, white and red, but also changed shape. the color change was very fluid and smooth and not blinking. After about 10-15 minutes a second shot up very very fast, stopped, and started dancing with the other (big circles, a drop, zigzags, back to circles). I ran inside to grab my camera, when i came back out, they were gone. one went to the stars, the other turned off like a light bulb. i kept searching and finally saw one off in the distance, this is the video below. <iframe width=1280 height=750 src=http://www.youtube.com/embed/sO_eqQFFGOU frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe>  http://youtu.be/sO_eqQFFGOU ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
