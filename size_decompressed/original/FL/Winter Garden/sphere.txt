Four red-orange orbs hovering over Central Florida;2015-02-14 19:18:00;2 minutes;Four red-orange orbs hovering over Central Florida On February 14, 2015, around 7:18 PM EST, while driving north-bound on SR-535, I noticed 4 red-orange orbs of light evenly spaced and moving from West to East in what appeared to be a straight line formation. I turned off the radio in the car and rolled down the driver side window in an attempt to hear some sort of sound - although the lights were still moving there was absolutely no sound. I couldn't determine if there was any solid objects behind the lights.  The lights were bright, not blinking and I didn't see any smoke or trail.  At first I guessed the altitude to be around 800-1,000 feet. I stopped the car on the side of the road - by this time the orbs of light were hovering high above my car still moving East and appeared much larger. Slowly they broke off the line formation, the 2 leading lights appeared to be slowing down and circling back around - the pattern was now random. As I continued to watch the orbs moving slowly, one of them, suddenly shoots or expels a small object at a high rate of speed downwards at an angle - the small object expelled looked like a white light with a short tail (looked like a tiny shooting star) - the white light and its tail quickly disappeared as it moved away from the orb - it maybe lasted 2 seconds at the most.  I now believed the orbs were higher in altitude and moving faster that what I originally perceived - maybe as high as 5,000 feet. I tried to call someone on my cell phone at least 3 times to get another witness to the event - but the calls didn't go through. I tried to change to camera or video but by the time I was able to do so the lights were so far to the East that they looked as small as any other star in the night sky. The whole time I could also see an aircraft (not sure if commercial or military) high in the sky (at least twice as high as the orbs) with normal set of blinking aircraft lights and also moving West to East.;28.5273999999999;-81.6011999999998
