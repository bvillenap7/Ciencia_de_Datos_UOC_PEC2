Golden Rectangular UFO Sighting in Orlando, FL,;2019-12-16 19:15:00;1 minute;Golden Rectangular UFO Sighting in Orlando,FL, On my way to practice, heading east on Highway 50, I saw a rectangular figure that was golden in appearance in the sky.  With this, I immediatly took out my phone and began recording. It emitted a golden light and moved around quite a bit. It would fade into black and I wondered where it went.  Then it reaapeared and faded even faster. I never saw the golden light that was emmited after that.  Once the situation was over, myself believing in that energy can be tranferred from entity to entity, I felt an energy that I had never felt before, and it sent chills up my spine and throughout my arms, leaving goosebumps.;28.5273999999999;-81.6011999999998
