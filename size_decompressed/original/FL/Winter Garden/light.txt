strange line of lights in the sky disappears when i start taping.;2011-07-08 22:12:00;3 minutes;strange line of lights in the sky disappears when i start taping. i was driving west on the 408 to the turnpike on ramp north and i saw these orange red lights in the sky in kind of a jagged line some lower than others.  i got curious and finally found my phone to record them on video. by the time i pulled over all of them had moved into the clouds except a couple. i did get a couple on camera but i shook so much and was fidgeting you can not see them real well unless you make the screen big and look for the lights.  i called 911 and told them i wasnt crazy and asked if anyone else reported anything and they told me to call the fbi so i called the fbi tampa headquarters because they were still open and the lady was very interested in what i had to say and when she said she had to get the phone number for the faa?  or whatever controls air traffic control to see if they knew anything the phone got silent and i got scared and hung up because i wasnt sure if i was being tracked by fbi or aliens or something. there are not normally many planes in this area and if there are they are definitely not 7-8 at a time coming in. they were an orange reddish color they were round sphere shaped lights. there were not blinking at all but possibly changing from red to orange or maybe that is just they way they looked. there were no other lights or color lights.;28.5273999999999;-81.6011999999998
Very bright white light in northwestern sky.  White/red light to its lower right side.;2013-11-22 22:00:00;1 hour;Very bright white light in northwestern sky.  White/red light to its lower right side. Very bright white light in the northwestern sky.  I have seen it this past week also around the same time.   Tonight, there was an additional white/red glowing light to the lower right of the bright white light.  Both lights were stationary for at least an hour.   I have looked up the night sky for tonight, and there are not supposed to be any stars, or comets in this direction.;28.5273999999999;-81.6011999999998
