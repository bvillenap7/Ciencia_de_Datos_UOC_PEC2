Silent, at tremendously high speed object seen flying north to south toward Panama City, FL;2001-10-03 11:00:00;5 seconds;Silent, at tremendously high speed object seen flying north to south toward Panama City, FL On Oct. 3, 2001, at about 11:00 a.m., I was a few yards west of our house when I noticed a large plane a little to my east slowly circling toward the north.  It is not unsual to see this type plane circling high above our place.  We live 45 miles North of the Panama City Ariport.  A little after I glanced up at the plane an object flew between me and the plane toward the south at a tremendous rate of speed.  I hardly had time to focus on it before it flew out of sight over the south horizon.  It was black and had a slight rectangular shape without wings or lights.  I estimated it to be about the size of a car, but it could have been much larger. I probably focused on it no more than 5 seconds. It made no sound and travelled much faster than any conventional craft that I have ever seen in my 63 years. It flew as straight as an arrow. I would never have known it was there if I had not already been looking at the nearby plane.  The boxy shape, plus the missile-like speed and silence makes it totally inconsistent with any flying craft I am familiar with.;30.8464;-85.69
