This object crossed the highway moving faster than a normal cloud and was the shape of a saucer. This object followed a straight line.  I had the cruse control on at 70mph and the cloud was infront of us but by the time we got to the spot where the object crossed the object was not  disapearing over the trees.  I kept on driving and about 10 seconds later we came to a clearing where we should have been able to see the cloud on our right but it was gone.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Lighted object observed strobing red, white & blue while completely stationary for apx. 20 mins. at altitude. Visual confirmation by AT;1999-02-18 02:00:00;20 mins.;Lighted object observed strobing red, white & blue while completely stationary for apx. 20 mins. at altitude. Visual confirmation by ATC. On 02-18-99, at 0200, I observed an object in the sky approximately 30 degrees above the horizon, northwest (approximately 315 degree magnetic)of the intersection of US 1 and Edgewood Ave. in Jacksonville, FL. Initially the object appeared to be a brighter than normal star and was noticed to shift colors, thought to be due to atmospheric distortion however, it was determined to be otherwise.  It was noticed that the object was strobing or changing from red to blue to white in a random order, but was clearly not a star or a planet.  It was observed through binoculars by myself and several other police officers, which verified the color changes, but no definitive shape of the object could be determined, because of the distance.  I made telephone contact with the tower at Jacksonville International Airport (JIA) and a controller visually confirmed the object west of his position (240 to 270 degrees), but informed me that he had no radar returns in that area, indicating that it was not an aircraft. (The airport was about 8 miles north of my location.)  The controller even joked that it could be a UFO.  Because the object remain completely motionless at altitude for an extended period, we ruled out a helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft.  The tower also assisted in ruling out a antenna, tower, or balloon.  After watching the object for several minutes I was distracted by more immediate business and when I return my attention to looking for it, it was gone.  I have not idea in which direction it proceeded.  If needed I can provide more specific directional and angle information.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
unusual light;1999-07-25 03:55:00;5 minutes;unusual light While walking the dog I am always star gazing and while looking at the sky a large red light just appeared.  This was no running light from a plane, to give an example of how large the light was, hold a quarter out at arms length and that is the size of the red light.  The light was stationary for about one minute and then the size of the light reduced to the size of a typical running light then slowly traveled along the coast going North.  It then stopped and turned into a white light of the same size and remained stationary for about for about 30 seconds, while stationary the white light grew in size to about the size of a fify cent piece.  There was a flash of lightning from a storm out over the ocean and then the light simply went out.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
A small white light moving through the night sky. (Not a sattelite!);2000-03-13 00:30:00;5 minutes;A small white light moving through the night sky. (Not a sattelite!) It was very late one night and I had a few friends over.  I was sitting outside on my patio, watching the stars, while the rest of my friends stayed inside.  As I watched, I noticed that one of the stars was moving ever so slowly.  My dad used to work in telecommunications and built a few satellites, so I assumed it was a sattelite.  It was almost directly overhead, moving Northward.  The light crossed the constellation Orion, then stopped by the head, turned around and started heading back towards the belt.  I called out to my friends inside, but by the time they got outside, the light did this zig zag thing and then blinked out.  I watched the light for about 5 minutes, but for most of that time, I was under the impression that it was a sattalite.  I really don't think sattelites move that way, though.

At 4AM I observed from my deck a bright lighted object at a high altitude in the west. With binoculars I noticed that it was stationary, and I observed 3 lights facing my direction. There was more of a greenish tint, but the lights strobed w/red, and yellow also. After about 20 minutes it moved further northwest out of my view, but reappeared in about 5 minutes, heading east. That is when I observed 2 more objects, at a greater distance, but w/same features.  Some of the time, they were covered by clouds, but they slowly moved due east towards the ocean (approx 15miles from where I live).  The sky was beginning to brighten, and they were too far away.  I called the sheriff's office, but no one else had reported these objects.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

Suspended in the same spot for over 10 minutes While out rollerblading last night noticed a large red object suspended in the sky. I was looking South in the night sky.  The object just cleared the tree line and looked to be fairly low in the sky approximately 10 miles away.  The light was a pulsating red light which moved up and down, (in relation to the tops of the trees).  The weather was clear and there was no cloud cover.  I watched the object for about ten minutes, it was just suspended in the Southern sky.  There were no flashing lights and it did not appear to be a plane,a flare, or a helicopter. When I went to get my husband, the object was no longer visible. I do not know if it flew away or if it just moved out of our line of vision.  This is about the third time I have seen this light in the sky during different times of the year. It always is in the same spot and some times it is visible for longer periods of time.

Moving North and in the NE sky about 25 degrees up.  I see planes at night all the time in the same area, in fact there were 2 planes much further south in the sky at the same time. After watching it slowly move North on a flat plane for about 45 seconds, the light started getting brighter and then suddenly a brilliant white flash expanded from the light that looked almost identical to a perfect fireworks circle.  The expansion was fast and stayed full circle for at least 5 seconds then slowly retracted to the original light. Then a separation occured, and the one light became two.  The second, slightly less bright was also moving in the same direction, but ever so slowly falling further behind (but staying on a flat plane).  After I could see no longer (behind trees) I quickly ran inside and checked the internet to see if the shuttle, or some other rocket had launched from Cape Canaveral.  Can't find any info about any launchings. ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the witness describes above the launch of a Titan IV missile out of Cape Canaveral, which occurred at 20:55 hrs.

It was motionless and I considered it some type of stationary satelite.I called up to the pilots and they also saw it.   We then notified Jax Center to see if they could see it. They made a joke of it and discounted our observation. I continued to watch the light until the end of our flight and in our car until we reached our house on the ocean at Ponte Vedra Beach.   Both Pilots and I then continued our observation from my driveway.  I estimated its height at least 100,000 feet.   After another 10 minutes or so the light flashed from one quandrant of the sky to another.  A viewing angle of at least 30 degrees.   It stayed at this location for only ten seconds and then disappeared to the west in an instant.   That was all we observed.  Thank you.

Six stationary and two moving near the others. All faded from view in 7 minutes. Eight total silvery objects were sighted together by my wife and I. Two of those objects moved near to and relative to the other six objects. All the object were to our Northeast, at about 75 degrees from the horizon and fairly close to each other. We were located at about University and Atlantic Blvds in Jacksonville, Fl. The objects were reflective of the setting sunlight behind us and had enough definition to determine they were objects in our atmosphere although they had only about the same brilliance as medium bright stars. Several jet planes flew through our view of those objects but may have been at a different altitudes. The eight objects were not in a formation but rather in the same general area of the sky. During about 7 minutes of watching them, they gradually faded from view.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

They seem to just linger in formation and slowly change to different formations which was strange to me almost look like stars but stars don't move that fast in the day or change formations.  The formations were like shapes like a plane, a five figure star, and something of a square zig zag and triangle.  The triangle slowly moved into a straigth line and then back which was weird i never seen that before. The thing is, if you did not focus on them you would lose track of them.

It was very bright but did not light up the sky, more like a skylight would look or one of those white light flashlights.

If we were not familiar with these planes and it was not so low, I would not have figured out it was one. The plane had red and blue lights going all around it in a circle kind of blinking on an off as they went around. I could see the actual military plane, as it was so close. Following behind it, about 50 yards, was a very big bright white ball of light. I looked back to the plane to see how it was pulling it but I didn't see anything. The plane went over my building and the bright white light followed. We couldn't see it any more as our building was in the way. We never hear any sound other than the plane.

I saw two lights as stars but a bit dimmer coming from North north east going South southwest. They were traveling to my best observation much lower than what you would see during the day when trails can be seen by an airplane and much faster. They were not blinking and moving very fast. Observation  from beginning to end would be approximately 7 to 8 seconds. There was no noise whatsoever, and the lights were not one right behind the other. They were at a distance of approximately 5 degrees and one behind the lead light was to the right offset to about 2 degrees.

Bright Orange Orbs Over Jacksonville Florida;2012-02-15 19:50:00;30;Bright Orange Orbs Over Jacksonville Florida I wanted to share this because Jacksonville seems to have lots of orange orb sightings.  February 15, 2012, @ about 1950.  Just West of Hodges Blvd. on Beach Blvd. in the Wolf Creek housing development, Jacksonville, FL.  Two bright orange lights in South-Western sky.  They were separated horizontally at about 45 degrees and maybe a mile or so vertically.  The bottom light was to the left of the top light.  I watched them for a few minutes and the bottom light started moving to the right.  When it was almost lined up with the top light, the top light started to move South-West very rapidly.  The bottom light started moving South-West also a few seconds after the first.  They both moved extremely fast and disappeared in the distance. I left the spot where I first spotted the lights and drove about two minutes or so to another part of the housing development.  I made a right on another road and the two objects were back in the same part of the sky.  I drove back to the original spot. They were arranged different.  The top one was to the left of the bottom. They sped off tho the South-West again.  Amazing!  The second time I saw them, there were two other people watching the lights.  We did not speak. Later that night I saw at least 8 more orange orbs moving though the sky.  They could have been Chinese lanterns, but they were not flickering like there was a flame.

The lights then began to move slowly behind my house out of my sight to which I ran outside to see how far it had moved, and it was gone. I continued to watch the sky for about thirty minutes, as I was still stunned and shocked that the enormous light had disappeared so quickly. I also noticed that the planes that were flying by had stopped as well.  By this time its 11pm and I went to bed.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

Sequence of events:  Three spheres initially spotted from an open window moving slowly with no sound in an evenly-spaced  zigzag pattern, then hovered momentarily as a fourth sphere joined them.  	* *         		*                     *  From a driveway view, I saw the spheres shift into square formation for approximately 15-20 seconds ... *	* *	*  until a larger, brighter sphere  entered the area from East at a faster rate of speed than the previous spheres. The smaller lights then broke the square formation into a line and began traveling NW with the larger sphere at the rear until they were out of sight.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Jacksonville, FL.  Two bright orange lights moving south to north.  No “contrails” seen, no sound.  Second light followed same path.;2017-07-04 21:42:00;20 seconds;July 4, 2017, 9:42pm: Jacksonville, Florida.   Two bright orange lights moving south to north.  No “contrails” seen, no sound.   Second light followed path of first light, approximately 10-15 seconds later.  Disappeared in extreme northern sky.   Sky was clear.   Difficult to determine altitude or speed, but seemed to be moving faster than typical aircraft.  Steady northward movement, but seemed to have gentle “zig-zag” motion in flight.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

I watched for maybe 2 mins as they moved very slow, and then gradually disappeared in the night sky.  They were moving towards the East from the direction I was sitting.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

It was as low down as a plane can fly and just very bright, but didn't seem very big at all.  It kept a straight patt S/E.   I've seen these before on different occasions that are pretty low and theu make no noise.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
After asking if any ETs were around tonight, to show me they are here and within seconds one flashed.;2019-04-20 20:00:00;2 minutes;I was outside on my porch skywatching, and after asking if any ETs were around tonight, to show me they are here and within seconds one flashed bright enough to get my attention.  So, I flashed my little green laser light up near it and then it flashed extremely bright.  I did it again and same response.   Then I asked it without the laser and it flashed extremely bright again in response.  It made me cry because i was able to communicate with it and get an actual response in return!  It was the best thing ever!  After it left over my area, it headed SE and did not flash again that bright.  It came from the NW direction from where I live.

There were 10-20 Star-like figures gliding across the sky in unison.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-30 21:30:00;2 minutes;There were 10-20 Star-like figures gliding across the sky in unison. As I was going for my evening walk, I looked up in the sky and initially I thought I saw stars but I noticed that these star-like figures were moving in the sky.  They moved all at once in almost a perfectly straight line.  The line was diagonal had a downward slope if you look from left to right.  There was somewhere between 10 and 20 of these star-like figures and they all were moving in the same direction, at the same speed, and at the same pace.  The sky was dark and these figures glided across the sky and within no more than 1-2 minutes, the figures were completely out of my sight.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Looked like stars, could have been satellites, but 50?  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-30 22:00:00;5 minutes;Looked like stars, could have been satellites, but 50? On April 30, 2020 at approximately 22:00 I was looking up while sitting on my deck. What appeared as two of the brighter stars near each other, about the width of your first two fingers making a peace sign held to the sky, as I did to measure, were moving in a southeast direction.  Seeing them move was surprising.  At about the rate of 5 seconds from my first to second finger.  But, after that I saw more stars, there were no colors or blinking and the sky was clear.  They came at the same spacing and continued.  I counted 25 when I saw two side by side.  After these, the single line continued and there came another 25 and again one pair side by side.  A minute after these ended, I saw a larger rectangle object, which looked like the space station.  I had seen the space station before and this looked and moved like it, from west to east.  But, I looked up the spot the station site and it wasn't supposed to be visible here until 04:00.  I read about the satellites in your site, but 50?;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Light object in sky traveling East, disappeared like a ZAP in dark sky;2020-06-24 04:25:00;15 seconds;Light object in sky traveling East, disappeared like a ZAP in dark sky I am a Truck Driver and Driving East on I-10 from Baldwin to Jacksonville FL, there was a bright light larger than a star but smaller than a plane flying East a little faster than a plane, but definitely not a shooting star.  It then disappeared  or ZAPPED  to darkness in the night sky. In the area above the sky had stars and clear skies in my area of view so there was no reason for the light to just disappear. It never reappeared.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

I paid no attention to it when I walked my second dog. When I walked my third dog, that is when it started pulsating, and moved very quickly in a diagonal way, above me. Than it started to change shape, color, and size. It went from this bright white light, to aan orange smaller light, it was moving too slowly to be an airplane and it didn't have the red and green blinking lights. As it was moving north above me, it got as small as a star, and just kept moving slowly. Than it pulsated to red, orange, blue, and within a flash it shot out of the sky like a shooting star.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
