Unkown object sighted approximately 30 degrees above the horizion bearing NW from near the intersection of US1 & Edgewood Ave. The object initially thought to be a star until flashing pattern of red, white, & blue lights was noticed. It was significantly brighter than a star and was observed through binoculars, but not clearly. It was definitely seen to change color. Witnesses all Jacksonville Police Officers. JIA tower was contacted and stated that they observed object to the West of their position but had no radar contact. They were also perplexed. Definitely not a helicopter or other aircraft. No towers of balloons in area. I was distracted and did not see what happened to the object, but it disappeared after approximately 20-30 mins.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

Everyone was sitting around in a circle on the driveway, with me being the only one with a direct (I beleave easternly) view of the night sky.  I first became aware of the object as a firey streak in the upper perferial vision of my left eye.  Thinking it was a shooting star, I quickly looked up, and indeed saw what appeared to be a very brightly lit and slow moving shooting star, (about 4 - 5 times the speed of a jet seen flying at high altitude) leaving an endouring firey trail in its wake. Just as I was about to dismiss the event as an identified object, my shooting star executed a series of very quick and very tight course changes resembling the letter S just before vanishing, more like burning out. No one else seemed to see it, and I didn't mention it, knowing that most people do not respond with an open mind. I am a military member, who is accustomed to seeing all types of aircraft. I know what I saw.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

That is when I noticed a object that had an appearance of a star, but had flashing lights. When ((woman's name deleted)) returned outside, I asked her if she noticed this object, she replied, Yes, I’ve been watching it for about an hour.  Then I got out my phone and turned on the video camera.  At that moment the object lowered behind the tree level.  It rose up and a lot of flashing lights went all around it the our eyes, but on video it shows a object of light shooting off of the one we was recording. It then started moving and stopping, and then lowered again. It came back up and stopped, and then flew away like and airplane would have been flying. This report will be on the local news Nov. 21st 2013. I have seen this object  1st in the north sky right above the tree level.  The 2nd sighting it was me and ((woman's name deleted)) and it was in the west sky, and again right above the tree level.  I called my mother, ((name of 2nd woman deleted)).  And the object moved alittle but that was it, and floated with the sky out of sight.  The 3rd sighting was in the south sky, right above the tree level.  Me and ((womnan #1)) witnessed this one as well.  I tried to video it but this phone’s camera isn’t as good as the other I had. A day right after the 1st sighting that I captured on video, I storm came thru that was like a UFO cloud that I captured on video as well;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
