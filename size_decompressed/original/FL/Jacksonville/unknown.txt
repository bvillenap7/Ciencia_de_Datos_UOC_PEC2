Falling green object north of Jacksonville;2007-01-15 21:00:00;3 seconds;Falling green object north of Jacksonville My wife and I witnessed a fairly large bright green object seeming to fall through the sky at a rapid rate.  We did not see an impact flash.   The object seemed to fall within a few miles of I-95, on the east side.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Fleets holding position;2011-10-01 20:00:00;every night;Fleets holding position 	 Every night in the Jacksonville, Florida Skies  A few weeks ago while star gazing, i started noticing that most of them were moving. Not in the direction of our planets rotation, but rather racing back n forth, turning on 90 degree n less angle turns. Also swaying back n forth. The movement from here on the ground would travel to what appears up to be about 1 to 1-1/2 before turning or curving back around in a different direction. That doesn't sound like much distance but if you consider that these objects are in our atmosphere, a star moving 1-1/2 in the sky must be a pretty good distance of travel. And the speed that they travel this distance must be great as well. They seem to be in patterns and holding there positions for the most part and have been there a while now.... As crazy as it sounds and appeared to me myself, I had to get some other person/s to see this as well to insure i wasn't seeing things. So I had my kids come out as well as a few of their friends to see these objects as well.. The did in fact see t! hem and noticed there movements just as I was... I myself do not the equipment or resources to film these objects, but believe someone should try to document them with a high powered telescopic/camera. Just have to get this out there n tell someone...Thanks...If you witness this as well please comment back, also if you have the equipment to document this please send me a copy...Thanks again...;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

We were standing outside when we noticed 3 lights in the sky. They were apart for about 30 seconds and then they were getting closer together.  Then all of a sudden the two lights on the left and right side vanished.  The middle light stayed another minute before it vanished as well.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Flashing flying object.;2014-07-22 00:05:00;3 minutes;Flashing flying object My boyfriend and I were sitting outside in front of his house, when he asked me to look up at the sky a little distance away and asked me what was that we were seeing.  It looked like a unidentified aircraft with bright flashing lights with multiple colors was slowly moving and then just stopped.   My boyfriend ran into the house and grabbed a pair of binoculars, and he first looked at it and then I did.   What I saw was multiple flashing lights that were the colors of amber, orange, white, red.    I couldn't tell what the shape of it was but I think it was rounded based on the formation of the lights.   We got in his vehicle and started down the street and by the time we got to the end of the street, it vanished.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
((HOAX??))  I finally have it on tape.;2014-09-22 19:30:00;3 minutes;I finally have it on tape. I finished giving my dog a bath outside in the front yard and I looked up in the sky and there is a object with blue and red lights flashing really fast.  I  heard a helicopter in the distance, but when the sound went away and the object was still in the sky, I knew it was not a helicopter.  The movement that the object was making was not of a helicopter or plane.   I left my home to follow it, and when I got to a close enough location it disappeared and appeared on the other side of the street in different colors.  Now it was flashing green and yellow lights.  It dropped below the tree line and didn't appear again. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax, we wonder.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Bright light on Hodes BLvd fast flying close not plane or helicopter.;2014-09-28 20:30:00;30 minutes;bright light on Hodes BLvd fast flying close not plane or helicopter Driving on JTB towards jax beach at 8:30 PM on 9.28.14 I saw a blue/red/pink/purple looking light going way up and down above the tree tops, in the area of beach blvd. At first I thought it was a helicopter. But the object moved so fast. It dove down and right back up and swirled around, way too fast and too bright to be a helicopter. It was not a plane either. I knew that from the start. It did not have the right shape or fly like one. As I turned on to Hodges blvd I continued to watch this light rise and fall in the sky. It would go way up in the air maybe 100 or 1000 feet and then fall right back down fast and zoom back up.  When I made it to my home my family got in the car with me and we drove toward beach blvd to try to find what it was. As we turned onto Hodges again we saw the ball of light zooming around.  It flew over the Windsor realty office and when we got in the turn lane to get closer it flew above our vehicle, about 10 feet above us. And then we pulled into Cape House and it zoomed away from us. It seemed to hover 20 feet away and above from us. I took out my camera phone and tried to get a video but the quality is horrible. As I started to film it I felt like it was watching us. It was so weird and then my husband took my phone from me and tried to zoom in on it and lost the light in the image. Then it zoomed up over the cape house office building. So we drove into Cape House Apts. Trying to ! find where it had gone but we never saw it again. We drove around for about 20 minutes trying to find it again. Got home at 9:20 PM. So It ended at about 9:00 PM.  We thought if it wasn’t government or alien then maybe someone had a gas powered flying toy that they modified with blue/red/pink lights. I don’t understand why no one else driving around noticed this thing and tried to find it too. It was so bright and flying so close and all over Hodges Blvd.  I want to say it was maybe a foot long of light but I couldn’t get a good view of it because of the bright light. It was so fast. I have no idea what it is. The lights did not blink. It was like a bright ball of light maybe a foot wide. NO sound. After the ball disappeared a Plane came by flying kind of low and we wondered if that was government coming to find out what it was too. Or maybe the plane had dropped a drone in that area. I'm stumped. The light seemed clear but we couldn't tell what it was attached too couldn't see anything but the light.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Pulsating white light on flying object that hovers in same area for a long time.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius?  PD));2015-12-10 23:00:00;15 minutes;Pulsating white light on flying object that hovers in same area for a long time. This is the 2nd time a pulsating object has been seen in the same part of the sky in the past 2 weeks.  This object appears to hover and has pulsating white light that appears to move around the object.  There is also a noticeable blue light that is only seen sometimes.   My first encounter was about 2 weeks ago and I quickly went to get my husband and was also joined by my daughter.  We all agreed it was not a plane or helicopter.  On this occasion, I noticed another smaller pulsating light to the right of the first one.  I don't know how long either of them stayed as I only watched for around 30 minutes.   Last night, I showed both my parents, this was after my husband and daughter both viewed it first.  My dad said it could be military and it might be over water.  It was quite a distance away.  We watched for around 15 minutes.  The object never moved. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius?  PD));30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

10 orb-like blinking objects seen flying during the day,;2017-09-19 18:08:00;6 minutes;10 orb-like blinking objects seen flying during the day, Two friends and me were on our road, just talking.  Looked up and noticed what appeared to be a blinking light.  This is when I noticed several of these blinking orb-like objects.  In total there was around 10 of them flying towards the west.   Made no sound, which would rule out helicopters or other aircraft, and were definitely not drones.   They eventually disappeared.  Whole sighting was around 6 minutes.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
