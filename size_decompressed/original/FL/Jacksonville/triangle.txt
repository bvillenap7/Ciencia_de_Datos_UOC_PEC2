A central disc in the middle of the craft and a disc at each angle. I found myself looking up at the object, then back looking at the cereus cactus. I looked up again and the craft started slowly taking off. It was now 2300. I ran into the house and asked a friend to come out. He witnessed the craft leaving the area.Craft was totally dark, no sounds were made by the craft ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD));30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
WHILE WALKING ON ATLANTIC BOULEVARD IN JACKSONVILLE I WITNESSED A BOOMERANG SHAPED OBJECT ALMOST COLLIDE WITH A COMMERCIAL AIRLINER;1975-12-07 11:45:00;3-5 MINUTES;WHILE WALKING ON ATLANTIC BOULEVARD IN JACKSONVILLE I WITNESSED A BOOMERANG SHAPED OBJECT ALMOST COLLIDE WITH A COMMERCIAL AIRLINER On a clear, cool day in December 1975 I observed a metallic boomerang shaped object have a near miss with a commercial airliner. Initially while walking along Atlantic Boulevard, I noticed the vapor trail of a south bound tri-jet (L-1011 OR DC-10) north of downtown. The estimated altitude was 35-40,00 feet. I then noticed a metallic booomerang shaped object approaching from east over the Atlantic Ocean to west. Initial altitude 20-25,000 feet. With amazing speed and rate of climb, it almost collided with the tri-jet heavy, The jet swived to avoid it, and the miss was so close that the vapor trail of the jet was broken by the object. I was truly terrified a mid-air collision was about to occur, but thankfully it didn't.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Saw a triangle shaped object traverse sky on very clear night;1983-06-15 21:30:00;3 minutes;Saw a triangle shaped object traverse sky on very clear night I am reporting this event for the first time, as I have not really considered researching any online articles or sites relating to this matter until now.  I am a professional who works in the medical field radiologic imagery (not X-ray).  This incident occurred when I was 14 years old. It may seem strange to describe the exact circumstances of my observation, but you have to see this through the eyes of a teenager.  I had a cassette player which was the type that your regular portable unit which was about the size of an elongated cigar box.  My parent's house was about 5 blocks from the ocean.  At night, the next door neighbor would come over and she would sit at the dinner table with my mom and talk for hours.  So, to play my music and get away from my surroundings, I would take refuge by easily ascending to the rooftop by clmbing a palm tree via the ac unit. One evening after dusk, 9pm, I was listening to music, not to loud on the rooftop, when suddenly, the tape stopped playing.  At first, I thought the batteries died, but I could see the rollers were still moving.  I fiddled with the volume wheel, but it was not that either.  Perplexed, I sat there for a minute thinkin that the tape was bad or my player was going bad.  I honestly do not remember why I looked up, but I did.  Then I just leaned back and stretched my arms behind my head.  I noticed something odd, but I could not figure out what I was seeing.  Something to the east and to the North was moving. I saw a dark triangular object that looked to me at the time like a black hang glider up in the clear star lit sky traveling from North to South at a speed of maybe 300 mph or more.  It was dead quiet and it was definitely up there.  No lights but it was so clear out, that I could see its shape.  Now, Ironically later in life, it seemed to me to look more like an F-117 stealth in its overall shape, but this was in 1983.  Whatever it was, it profoundly etched itself in my memory.  About 30 seconds after traversing the peripheral of my view,  the tape player started playing music again. It was playing the song as if it had missed the part where the track was silent.  Before this incident, and after, I never had any problems with the tape or the machine, until I got rid of the player a few years later. I do not claim to have seen a UFO or a secret military craft.  But what I saw defied any satisfactory explanation to this day. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

Triangualar shaped object hovering in place.VERY close to the road,and this was a busy highway with people in front and behind.At night;1995-10-07 22:30:00;3 min;Summary : Triangualar shaped object hovering in place.VERY close to the road,and this was a busy highway with people in front and behind.At night.Slow rotation. It was stelth black in shape of a triangle hovering extremly close to the highway to theleft of us.It was right above some trees and a street light turning slowly clockwise.A red light was at each corner and a large white light was in the center.There were other lights smaller and scattered.It was definately an equalateral triangle.For some reason when we were driving by I noticed it and pointed it out to the others and they saw it but would not admit it was unusual.I kept saying it was something not ever seen around here .Strangely everyone in the car began to refuse to look at it as if it were not there,but I knew it was,and started getting agitated with me and telling me to hush.When I had first pointed it out to my friend he got really frightened or excited and tried with me to show the people in the front but then he got all quiet.When I asked why he had stoped he just told me it must be something else like a street light.I have perfect 20 20 vision and that thing was only as far away as a hundred feet.Im also an artist and have a photographic memory,i know !i saw something.The people in the car with me seemed to be in denial the whole time.Now when I mention it to them they dont even remember what happened,they look at me like Im nuts.I even triedto talk to them the next day after it happened and they had no idea or memory.I was 15 then and have no history of hallucinations.This DID happen.P.S. I can give a vivid drawing but I dont know how to send it,would you contact me please?;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

Triangle shaped craft hovering about 70ft at old kings and baymeadows-quiet hissing sound.;2000-02-18 22:00:00;5 min total;Triangle shaped craft hovering about 70ft at old kings and baymeadows-quiet hissing sound. A friend and I were driving East on baymeadows and saw four lights from what we thought was a plane. There are C-130's that fly around here so that's what i thought it was. But we got closer and the lights weren't moving. At the light of lod kings and baymeadows we noticed that the object wasn't moving. There's a bridge just East of the light and I stopped near the top in the median. I turned off my radio and rolled down my window and heard a quiet hissing, like engines but almost like rushing air. My friend and I looked at each other and I yelled Do you see that! Do you see that! It's HOVERING! It's not moving! He shook his head and continued to watch in disbelief with me. I proceeded to say it wasn't a harrier cause they're smaller and much louder and that was the only plane that I knew of that could hover. I at first thought it was a bomber because of the size but it was hard to get a good look cause it was dark out and I believe the craft was too. Would make sense. There were 4 lights in the front but they didn't help with seeing the rest of the ship. My friend said that it looked like a tringle, more like a bomber and I said yeah but they don't hover. After about 2 min it started to move away slowly westward. We continued on our way lokking back several times but lost site of it within a minute. It was approximately 70 ft in the air and we were as close as a football field, actually closer. I asked the person at the establishment that it was over(a couple days later) if anyone had mentioned anything and they said no, not that they knew of. When we had gotten to our destination the night of, we talked to a couple officers and told them what we saw and they said they thought they heard a similar sound but couldn't find the source. I don't know what it was-an advanced plane was my first thought. Hope it's helpful.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

A nighttime triangle type craft.;2001-10-17 22:25:00;5 seconds;A nighttime triangle type craft. When I have a clear night sky I like to look for satellites.  Wednesday the 17th of October was one of those nights.  I was waiting for a magnitude 3.3 satillite scheduled to pass overhead at 22:18 hours. When it was apparent that I would not be able to see it come overhead I called my dog and took one last look. It was then that I noticed a triangle shaped object, moving north to south, making no noise.  The object appeared to be grey against the darkness but only in certain areas of the triangle.  It was like the formation of geese but I do not believe they fly at night, if they do I have never not heard a flock of geese when they are flying. Another strange aspect was that this non solid appearing thing blocked out stars as it passed over.  The speed was faster than a jet aircraft, but not a rate of speed that was out of this world. I estimate the size to be approximately 150 feet long and 120 feet wide, based on the height that I perceived this to be.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
solid triangular formation of white lights, probably birds;2005-11-11 21:00:00;1.5 seconds;solid triangular formation of white lights, probably birds While standing in a restaurant parking-lot, in the evening, near a busy general-aviation airport, I looked up to see a twin-engine plane at low altitude.  The plane was heading ESE generally.   I noticed, near the plane and heading south, a formation of approximately ten white lights in a solid triangular pattern, like a rack of billiard balls. After about a second-and-a-half, the lights dimmed, then disappeared.   The spacing, altitude, direction, time of year, and dimming would be consistent with a flight of geese heading south, their undersides reflecting bright parking-lot lights, although I have never seen a solid triangular formation of birds. ((NUFORC Note:  We congratulate the witness on his being descriminating as to what it was he observed.  We suspect that a flight of migratory birds would have been visible for more than 1.5 seconds.

Dark triangle shape with v-shaped lights over the St Johns River.;2005-12-17 21:30:00;3 min;Dark triangle shape with v-shaped lights over the St Johns River. I'm a Captain of a tugboat and was returning to my dock after finishing a job.  I was heading outbound on the St Johns River entering Trout River Cut on a NE course.   The weather was poor all day with rain and wind and the weather at the time of this sighting not exactly perfect with rain squalls and wind.  As I turned into the cut I could make out one white light up ahead about a mile and a half off of my bow slightly to starboard.  I figured it was probably a small vessel that I would keep an eye on.  As I got a little closer I notice two lights, one on top of the other, like the mast lights of a tug with a tow so I gave a security call on my VHF with no response.  I checked my radar but it was obscured with the rain and was,  all greened out.  The lights seemed to be stationary about a mile or so ahead of me and seemed to be at or just above water level.   About a minute later I was becoming concerned about having to meet a tow in this narrow channel in this kind of weather, so I decided to shine my spotlight at the lights.  I did this to make the other vessel aware that I was heading in its direction and to also try and see if I could tell what kind of boat I was about to meet.   As soon as I hit the lights with my spotlight it made a Bee-line right for me at a pretty good pace.  I immediately turned off my spotlight and thought  Oh great, I just blinded a Navy Helicopter pilot from Mayport.  But as the light came closer more white lights appeared kinda in a line with the center light brighter and the lights out to the side of it dimmer.  I got this weird chill up my spine and thought Holly Crap its a $@#!@^% UFO!   It passed  my tug down the starboard side at about a 40 degree upward angle.  It was probably about 200 feet off of the water heading rapidly SW.  As it passed I could make out a dark triangle silhouette with 6 to 8 white lights in a V shape on the underside.  It was fairly large , about the size of a bus.    I watched as it passed and the silhouette against the low clouds looked almost saucer like from the back.  In few seconds it was gone heading towards downtown Jacksonville.  I never heard a sound. I have ran tugs for a while and have never seen anything like this.  I have never believed in little green men or any of that other stuff but this shook me up.  I had 3 other crewmen on the tug with me but 2 of them where off watch and sleeping and my engineer was making his rounds.   It spooked me so much I had my engineer sit with me in the wheelhouse the rest of the trip.  I did not tell him why, just that the weather was bad.  He could tell I was shook up and I brushed it off for fear of him thinking I was seeing things.   I've heard other mariners say they have seen things but I always didn't really give it much mind until now.    As soon as I got home I went online to look for information and am amazed at all of the similar sightings.  I now have a new prospective and I'm a little uneasy about what I might run across while I'm at sea. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

A triangle with bright white lights at each point and red flickering light in the middle. Lasted about 40min.;2007-03-10 02:00:00;45min;A triangle with bright white lights at each point and red flickering light in the middle. Lasted about 40min. I looked out my window about 1:00am or so to the west of the city and saw an unusual white light with a red flickering light that was really low, to low to be a star. I thought it was a plane or helicopter, except it wasen't moving toward me or away from me. It did looked like it was slightly moving side to side a little but still staying in the same place. I thought maybe it was a meteror falling and waited for it to burn out as it came closer to the atmosphere. About 20 to 30 minutes went by and it still was not moving. I then went and got my binoculars to get a better look. As I focused on the light it was pretty wild, it was a triangle with a bright white light at each point and red was flickering in the middle. I watched this for about 10 minutes and still never moved. I went to put the binoculars up and as I came back it was gone. I was only gone for about 45 to 50 seconds. Now this is funny, I just went out to measure the time that I was gone and I looked out the window just now and there it is again. This time it's further away. I got my binoculars and could see it very clearly but it's now further away. I assume this is a star. It has white lights and the red light flickering in the middle. It's almost in the same spot as the other night. Just north of this light is another but to far to really tell. I hope I'm not crazy and sorry to waste your time if it is just a star. I'm not sure if I really believe in UFO's anyway, but it was and is pretty interesting.  Good luck,;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
The triangle strikes again;2007-03-25 00:00:00;1 min;The triangle strikes again I was sitting in my garage reading a book, when i felt the need to move out to the driveway to enjoy a smoke. Like any other time I smoke outside I gaze upon the night sky. This night would reveal something to me, and not the first time I have seen objects of unidentified origin moving in the sky.  I was looking at this one start in the western part of the sky when I seen a star shaped obect moving away from the star. At first I thought plane, but no blinking lights. What would further tell me it was not a plane is when 2 more lights kicked on and made a perfect equilateral triangle.  To ensure I was not seeing things I glaced elsewhere for about 10 seconds and returned to the object in question. To my amazement it was still there growing the distance between the star it originated from. After what seemed to be a minute the distance had grown extremly and the all 3 lights disappeared.  The lights were all white and in each corner of the equilateral triangle.I couls not make out anything else but the lights since it was so late but I could only guess the ship color had to be dark only because I felt like I was watching 3 stars move, but the fact they moved perfectly together with no change in distance from the other lights told me they were connected to a much bigger object.  I was not Fearful simply because if life does exist beyond ours i doubt with such amazing technology they would be coming to do harm to us. Truely an amazing sight.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Large, silent, triangles in Jacksonville, FL;2008-03-05 20:00:00;2-3 seconds;Large, silent, triangles in Jacksonville, FL I saw something strange in the sky once but I'm an idiot so I didnt write the date down.  However, I'm certian it was on a day between Feb. 10 and Apr 5, 2008.  I will describe the best I can.... I was in Jacksonville, Fl on the campus of Jacsonville U.  I saw a silent, dark, triangular object cruising at an altitude of no more than 1,000 ft and the length of each side appeard to be approx. 160 feet, give or take 20 ft.  I clocked it at bout 75-100 mph and was standing almost directly underneath its flight path (it was about 120 ft off to my left side) and there was a circular white light near each corner of the triangle (8-15 in diameter?). It was also headed North.  I didn't make a big deal about it to my friends cause theres no point and it's honestly not that shocking to me.  But it was awesome b/c that technology seemed eithr a good many evolutions ahead of the current stuff on the mass market or it was alien.  Either way ! O SHITson!!  I promise this is the truth, this is the first and only time I've seen anything like it 24 years and I was sober and on no meds, know what I mean. sincerely, ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

UFO seen over St Johns River;2008-06-18 21:45:00;1 min;UFO seen over St Johns River I was standing on a dock on the St Johns river watching an approaching thunderstorm when I noticed a shadow against the clouds.  As it moved a little closer I could just make out the shape of a triangle or possibly a diamond shaped object.  The object was solid black and about 100 feet long moving very slowly heading south towards downtown Jacksonville.  It was completly silent and I guess about 80 feet off of the ground.  It was probally a quarter mile from my location.  I could also make out a couple small dim white lights that seemed to be on the edges.  At one point it looked like it momentarily turned on some sort of spotlight for a few seconds and shined it on a large ship docked at the port.  It freaked me out and I could not believe what I was seeing.  I watched for about a minute then ran inside to get my wife.  When I came back outside it had started to rain and I could no longer see the object.  This is the first time I have ever seen anything like this.  I don't want to tell anyone because they might think I'm a nut case.  My wife gave me this funny look.  All I could do was stand there with my knees shaking.  I actually had trouble sleeping thinking about what I had seen.  Very strange and creepy. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I was traveling west on I-295 approaching the Buckman Bridge when I saw a light that I thought to be a helicopter out over the St Johns River to the south.   As the object got closer to the bridge, I could that it was a very large pitch black triangle shape that was moving in a north westerly direction.  It looked like a triangle shaped black hole against the night sky and clouds.  It at first had one bright white light then changed into 3 dim yellowish lights.   It was still out over the water as I traveled on and out of sight.  It was a really dark night with rain and some lightning.  The black triangle shape really stood out against the low clouds over the river.  It was more than a hundred feet long and a couple of hundred feet from the water.   Very odd, kinda freaked out.

Hovering triangular craft with search lights.;2014-04-07 06:45:00;1-2 minutes;Hovering triangular craft with search lights. I was driving along the I95N at about 06:45 when I saw something very bright in the sky in front of me.  It was still dark.  At first I thought it might be a star, but as I drew closer I realized it could not be.  As I continued to travel along the freeway I was watching it and it did not appear to be moving.  I considered that perhaps it was a signal light on top of a cell phone tower or similar but I was not aware of any such construction in the area. As I got closer and it came clearly into view, it appeared to be triangular in shape and the size of a large plane.  It seemed to hover and didn’t have any speed like an airplane or jet would.  There was also no audible sound coming from it.  Although I did not lower the windows on my vehicle, I feel sure that had it been a plane of that size I would have heard the roar of the engines. The other thing that struck me as unusual was that it appeared to have search lights on it.  They were very big and round and they faced down, towards the ground, not like the head lights of an airplane.  It did also have a red and green light on it which I understand is used to signal port and starboard on aircraft. I am not sure how many of these search lights were on this triangle as I did not count them, but I would guess at perhaps 6 or 8. I was unable to stop on the freeway, or to take picture whilst I was driving so I took the off ramp and drove around to where I normally park, hoping I would still be able to see it, however by the time I got around the building, I could no longer see the craft.

Large triangle craft.;2016-05-13 21:30:00;2-3 minutes;Large Triangle Craft This was a big triangle.  It didn't have the lights on the bottom that I have read about but it did have some faint lights around the perimeter and they were blue.  I live about 6 miles north west of NAS-JAX and it came from that direction so I assume it is very possible this was a military aircraft but it doesn't make a lot of sense to me that they would fly secret craft over very populated areas.  Anyway it was moving very slow and you could really only even make it out, at first, because of the perimeter lighting.  I am no aeronautical expert by any means but it was certainly lower than the normal craft we see flying around here (but I don't know what that elevation is...) I am going to guess that it was at around 8 to 10k feet.  This just happened so I am a little excited, I apologize if I am skipping around. After a couple of minutes it got brighter - significantly brighter - and then sped away very, very quickly - still heading north-west.  I only even went outside because my dogs were barking at the door yet no one was there.  I didn't even think to mention that until I got to the part of your form that asked if animals noticed.  I did take a picture on my phone but there is nothing there.  You can't even see the outline.  I can send it if you think you could find something on it.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
While stargazing, an ultra fast moving, glowing (white/yellow) object appeared in a clear, cloudless sky.  ((anonymous report));2016-05-29 00:30:00;1-2 minutes;While stargazing, an ultra fast moving, glowing (white/yellow) object appeared in a clear, cloudless sky, much like any shooting star might suddenly be spotted as it enters the atmosphere.  It initially appeared to be moving slightly downward and was thought to be just that, a meteorite.   It then appeared to level out ever so slightly, still at very high altitude.  It had a Southern heading.   As it was tracked visually, its abnormal shape became more apparent.  The chevron-like outline was the only part that appeared to glow (now a white/blue) and thus was clearly visible, but the interior portion, while difficult to make out, was definitely opaque (making the object a triangle rather than just a chevron).   Just before the object left line of sight, it abruptly and instantly changed direction and increased speed, heading East, toward the Atlantic coastline.  There was no trail, haze, or sound throughout the duration of this sighting. As a military veteran, I initially suspected some sort of stealth craft upon recognizing the unnatural shape, but nothing in the United States military arsenal (that is known publicly or that I've seen during my time in service) can travel that fast or instantly change direction at such speeds. This was my first unidentified flying object sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
