Large - LARGE object traveling at speeds 4 times that of a jet - brightly glowing white - like the moon. Traveling at close range 45 - 60 degrees diagonally toward the ground.  Too close and large to be a shooting star.  If this was a plane, we should hear of a crash on the news tonight - not likely.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

I was confident that I was watching the space shuttle Discovery returning form it's mission. I watched as it streaked along the sky at a slow pace with what seemed to be sparks and embers trailing behind. It glowed orange and then red and back to a dark orange. After a few minutes it decended below the treeline where I could not see it. It also appeared to be losing its color. There were several aircraft that seemed to be in the vicinity so again I felt it was a normal shuttle landing.  I just read that the shuttle landed around 1:00pm versus this event that I witnessed around 8:00pm. I have contacted several news outlets that have also had recent calls regarding this strange object.  I have never seen something like this and wasn't unhinged about it until I found out it wasn't our space shuttle returning home.   saw the same thing looked like it stopped over the ocean then saw it take off right back the way it came at i very high rate of speed. my girlfriend watched it too ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Oval or round shaped object passed by during lunar eclipse, emitted neon blue light.;2008-02-20 22:00:00;5-10 sec;Oval or round shaped object passed by during lunar eclipse, emitted neon blue light. We were observing the lunar eclipse. Shortly after 2200, I saw an object that was round to oval in shape I am unsure if it was tilted if at all. It was not emitting any light at first but a faint reflection of light pollution making its shape apparent. I was facing east it passed by at about 20-30 degrees above the horizon moving from south to north. I noticed it first coming into sight from the right behind a few trees. It was in plane sight for approximately 90-120 degrees, for 5- 10 seconds.  For the last 3 seconds of my observation, it was emitting a neon-blue light. There was no apparent source of the light, meaning no visible bulb or bulbs, it looked like it was projected off of the surface or the surface itself was emitting the light in sporadic pulse. Only parts of it were making light, not the whole object, it was not in unison or uniform. It was like an imitation of lightening or the reaction to some form of stimulation, comparable to bio-lumination. It stopped making the blue light just before it fell out of sight behind more trees. It did not slow, stop, accelerate, or alter course for the duration of my observation.   I am within 5 miles of a municipal airport, and within 10 miles of a naval station, that holds near constant helicopter operations, this was not a helicopter, I have military training in identifying and reporting surface and air “contacts” and identifying standard light configurations, I am very familiar with the helicopters I used to observe in the military and watch fly over the house every day and all hours of the night. It did not make a sound. I can only speculate the altitude of the object it was low enough to reflect a very faint and dull light from urban lumination for the duration of my observation.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
My friend and I looked at each other and said, “What just happened?”;2008-04-24 14:15:00;20 seconds;Our class was at recess. I happen to look north-west above a middle school when I saw an oval shaped, purple and silver object. A friend walked over to where I was standing and looked in the same direction. He was watching the same object. It took off 20 seconds later into the Northern sky. My friend and I looked at each other and said, “What just happened?” ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD));30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Oval shaped craft with blunt ends no lights, completely black.;2013-02-10 22:00:00;2 seconds;Oval shaped craft with blunt ends no lights, completely black In early February, 2013, I stepped out my front door with my Jack Russell terrier so he could do his business one last time for the night.  As I recall, it was around 2200 and the moon was nearly full and there was some sporadic cloud cover. The front of my home faces east and it is located about twenty five miles west of the Atlantic ocean and about eighty miles north of Cape Canaveral. As I gazed up at the moon, I observed a dark, elliptical shaped object silently pass in front of the moon, almost blotting it out, and then disappear in the cloud cover.  I was able to view the object for approximately two seconds, as it crossed south to north.  It was hard to gauge its size, but the impression I was left with was that the object was very large it was oval shaped in the middle, but the ends were blunt, or square. I quickly dismissed the object as being an aircraft because it had no wings or navigation lights.  The object was completely blacked out.  It was several days before I mentioned the sighting to my wife, who met my revelation with a very perplexed expression.  We’ve been married for twenty three years and she served twenty of my twenty one years in the Marine Corps married to me, not to mention the past seven years that I have been a police officer, and my wife knows I am not easily impressionable, prone to exaggeration, or likely to joke about such things. Occasionally I have caught glimpses of shuttle launches from my front yard, but I truly cannot explain what it was that I saw that night in February.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Black oval craft flying below cloud line making no sounds, displaying no lights & travelling at high velocity.;2014-04-04 17:35:00;20 seconds;Black oval craft flying below cloud line making no sounds, displaying no lights & travelling at high velocity. April 4th, 2014, I was about to return to work after lunch break was over.  I was walking in the door and glanced up in the sky to try and see if it looked like it was going to rain, a Black orb/oval shaped object caught my attention.  The object was flying across the sky horizontally towards the downtown area, the rate in which it was moving looked faster than any fighter jets that i have seen flying. The back object was moving rather fast, however there was no sound or flashing lights like airplanes, jets or helicopters have.  As the object was moving towards the direction of the downtown area (10-15 miles from my workplace), it appeared to rotate mid-air resulting in looking more narrow and smaller than it did when i first noticed.  After a couple seconds in this narrow appearance it rotated again and was back to the first observed shape. From the moment I initially saw the object until it was out of view lasted about 15-20 seconds. There were clouds covering the sky, and I am no expert of the distance of things, but it was well below the cloud line.  My guess is this object had to be between 1,000 feet - 2,000 feet in the air. I rushed inside work to tell my co-workers what I had seen only to get laughed at.  Within a minute of entering the building, my co-workers & myself heard what sounded like 2 fighter jets flying overhead & the sound of the jets was going in the same direction as the object. I do not know what the black orb/oval was that I saw.  The object made  No sounds,  No lights and a fast velocity, which was shortly followed by some fighter jets.  I can only describe the object as a U.F.O,  I'm not automatically assuming Extra Terrestrial, I just can't explain what the object was.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
White, star like orb slowly moves across the night sky for 30 seconds.;2014-06-25 22:15:00;30 seconds;White, star like orb slowly moves across the night sky for 30 seconds While walking my dogs I was looking up at 2 stars.  Suddenly, a white oval appeared to the left of one of the stars.  I thought it was another star because it looked like one.  However, the orb slowly moved across the night sky for about 30 seconds and simply disappeared. It had no flashing lights and made no noise.  I have seen these orbs many times before.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Orange oval object, hovering in one place for about 30 secs, then makes a large circle and vanishes.;2014-07-04 21:15:00;30 seconds;Orange, oval object, hovering in one place for about 30 secs, then makes a large circle and vanishes I was driving, people were shooting fireworks behind me, but I saw something hovering about 200 yards above me.   It was oval and bright orange, and was not moving, which is what caught my eye.  I stopped the car and tried filming it.  I only got about 20 seconds worth of footage, but what I captured was the orange oval rising in the sky.  It made a circle then vanished.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
White Disc In the Sky:  Viewed From Riverside Avenue.;2014-10-05 10:00:00;5 seconds;White Disc In the Sky:  Viewed From Riverside Avenue So I had a terribly weird morning. I woke up with strep throat, which had started kicking in last night.  I tried all types of medicines and finally gave up and went to the hospital.  After being diagnosed and given my prescription for antibiotics and pain meds, I went to a diner and had breakfast while I waited for the pharmacy to open.  At the diner I check my Facebook page and I read a message from my sister Dad has cancer and is not going to do chemo.  Then crying.  Then pharmacy to pick up meds, call dad, he is too sick to talk, and eventually drive back home. I am one block from my house though and see this disc in the sky. It is a white disc, oval shaped.  At first I just thought, what a weird shaped cloud, but then I realized it was moving.  I passed my house and continued down the street to catch a better glimpse of this thing.  I quickly reach for my phone to take a picture and it quickly flies away.   I park at Memorial Park on the river and try to look for it , but it is no where to be seen. This is the second alien sighting I've seen in the last 6 months, and last time I was with two other friends (all of us sober!) who saw it as well.  Last time it also happened that when we brought out our cameras it disappeared, but last time it was flashing different colors and it was also night time instead of daylight . Very interesting.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Free floating Orbs above Sunbeam Road in Duval County, Florida.  I watch sober.;2016-05-01 22:30:00;continuous;Free floating Orbs above Sunbeam Road in Duval County, Florida.  I watch sober. Almost every night, a large orange orb in the sky that is located above Craven road off Sunbeam Road in Jacksonville, Florida.  A planet does not move at will nor do stars while this orb does.  I looked at it one night and thought to myself, if this thing is satanic, evil, it has to do what I say, as that is what the bible says.  So, I looked at and “thought clearly”, “Move away from me if you are evil. “Here’s the weird thing It did just that. It has two orbs below it that blink constantly.  One blinks dark blue and light blue and the other blinks red, white and green.  The red white and green orb has actually moved on its own, much like a drone, but there are no drones that look like it.  This orb has a saucer shape but you can only see an outline as if it is covered in camouflage paint, it blends with the night sky.  Again, there are no drones that are like this.  It is the size of a very large helicopter but completely quiet, not even a whistle sound like a drone would make. They seem very curious about the people in the apartment complexes on Sunbeam Road for some reason as well.  I have observed a figure with only an outline walking by one of the buildings that looked too skinny and small to be a human. Shaped like a grey but, with a smaller head, barely visible.  These orbs seem to enjoy being near the hill located by Sunbeam Road across from the veterinarian hospital but they have moved location, sometimes sitting above the post office in front of the trees.   There is also an isosceles Triangle located above Sunbeam Road that changes locations quite often and has an odd rounded shape at the bottom. I get a very creepy feeling when I look at it, almost like someone is staring at me.  I have made the attempt to create a drone to fly towards the red, white and green orb, I call it Italy, but, I am stuck trying to figure out a good power source to fly that far.  I also do not want it to destroy or take my drone nor assume it to be a hostile attack.  It has flown directly over a plane one night, very slowly, showing its size.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
still craft hangs in sky flashing a sequence of three lights then falls out of the sky and vanishes.;2021-05-30 21:12:00;9 minutes;still craft hangs in sky flashing a sequence of three lights then falls out of the sky and vanishes. DATE AND TIME: May 30th, 2021 at 9:13 PM EST  LOCATION: Jacksonville, Florida 32244  SITUATION: Myself (name 1 deleted)s, my wife (name 2 deleted), and my brother (name 3 deleted) were watching a movie on our back deck, I excused myself to relieve myself near the gate entrance of our fence, I first looked up and notice what looked like an airplane passing by, but upon second glance I noticed that the object was not in motion. I quickly called over Ashley and Trey and the three of us bared witness to an unidentifiable craft hovering perfectly still in the sky. The craft appeared and was believed to be roughly five miles away and roughly one or two miles high in the sky. There were three perfectly rounded lights that looked to be the size of a small car that flashed in a sequence of red, red, green -- green, green, red, then back again. This sequence never slowed, sped up, or faltered.  The craft hung there in the sky and the lights sequenced this way from the time I initially saw it at roughly 9:12 PM, we began filming the event with our phone at 9:13 PM. From that time until 9:21 PM there was no change or movement. At roughly 9:21 PM the unidentifiable craft suddenly plummeted from its fixed point in the sky and dropped so fast and unnaturally it vanished behind a tree-line and did not reemerge. The craft was located in the west approximately 271 degrees west, and it sat in between the gemini constellation. In the video we are including , there is background noise of the movie we were watching, apologies, we do pause the movie I believe halfway though the video. At the 2:38 marker of the video is when the craft falls from the sky.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
