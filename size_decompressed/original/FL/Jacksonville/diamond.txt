It was;1998-07-17 02:10:00;30 Seconds;Diamond Shape Object Glowing incadescent Yellowish, The object was to our front right hovering just slightly below cloud level.  It was about 50 Feet tall and had about 10 beams of white light comming out of the bottom of the lower half of the triangle (Like a skirt)  They were about 20  feet long in length and glowed like Florescent Lights.  The beams were straight but they came out of the ship at a slight angle.  The object moved away and the beams of light disapated as they blew away in the wind. I think the beams of light were generated by some sort of Ionization from the vehicle.  The beams were of almost equal lenghts even though they  were from farther up on the ship.  The light from the moon on the left of us distracted our vision from the right where the diamond was heading. At that time we pulled over next to an off ramp and tried to see where the diamond went to but it was too late.  There were other vehicles on the off ramp backed up.  I don't know it they was what I saw!  But it was unusual for a off ramp to be backed up at 2:15 in the morning.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
3 dimensional diamont craft ,in front yard,quarter mile from University of jacksonville FL.;2008-12-08 01:17:00;6 minutes;3 dimensional diamont craft ,in front yard,quarter mile from University of jacksonville FL. At the night of 12/08/2008 a friend and I were sitting outside my home talking when what looked like a shooting star coming through the atmosphere shot towards us,and stopped aprox 15feet above our heads,and just hovered still in one spot. The shape of the craft was a 3 dimensional diamont,with from  dim grey to bright white pulsating orbs on each corner and tips of the craft. Each time the orbs dimmed we could observe a purple/grey surface,with odd almost hyroglyphic carvings on the object. The aprox. size of the craft,probably just 4feet in hight,and about 3,5feet in diameter.(in my opinion,I don't believe it to be a manned craft,but rather a type of probe) It was giving of an almost silent humm. After about 2 minutes of shock,I opened my frondoor and called my 2 roommates,to come outside.  As they came outside,the object started to hover across the street at 5-10 mph,then stopped above the houses across from us,stood still for another 30 secs.to 1 minute,then shot of back into the cloud cover.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
It is diamond in shape with 12 or more bright lights on the bottom of the object.;2010-06-13 21:24:00;still going on;It is diamond in shape with 12 or more bright lights on the bottom of the object There is a ufo near our home, 5 miles from the Naval Base, in Jax, Fl   It is not as high as airplanes.  My husband thinks maybe it might be a satellite and sun is shining on the object.  I think since the design and the many lights (12 or more), seems to me to be a U F O.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Reddish-yellow elongated diamond star-sized lights moving in elongated V formation against night sky that gradually disappeared.;2013-02-08 21:45:00;10-15 minutes;reddish-yellow elongated diamond star-sized lights moving in elongated V formation against night sky that gradually disappeared I was just out in my backyard around 9:40 pm Saturday, February 8th looking at the evening sky-some low clouds, a clear moom, stars bright against the night sky.  And then I noticed these lights, as bright and slightly larger than the stars, the color of a lit match- something between red and yellowor, like a hot orange.  There were 5 or 6 of them moving steadily from right to left in an elongated V formaton at a moderately steady pace.  The one furthest to the right was highest with the next one slightly lower, the next lower still, the next dropping much lower, the next much higher and the last higher still. They weren’t blinking or alternating color like lights from a plane, neither was there any noise like helicopters make.  I followed them as they moved across the sky until they were blocked by large tree, so I went out into the street to follow them and noticed two or three of them were gone.  I watched the ones remaining as they continued their path across the sky and noticed that one by one, from the right to the left, they were becoming fainter, losing color until they disappeared.  And then they were gone.. It was truly the strangest thing I’ve ever seen and have no idea what they were.  I’m not one for conspiracy theories and figure there’s an explaination other than extraterrestial, but I’m totally at a loss for what it is.  When I did a search online, I was shocked to find so many hits of similar sittings over the last year and from many locations across the country.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Louver-like design, lights emitted no light pollution, Hovered slightly above clouds.;2017-10-13 03:00:00;15 seconds;Louvre like design, lights emitted no light pollution,  Hovered slightly above clouds. My understanding of these sightings in the past to me have been that these people must be of not sound mind.  Simply put that has changed.  I now have been a witness and through thorough online research have found many other conversations of this nature.  My wishes in this letter are that I bring to attention a possibility of a defense flaw in our technology, also a possibility to learn from their designs as well as seek video evidence which will allow a reverse engineering if possible of the technologies in which they use. I went outside at 3:48 am 10/13/2017 at 30°15'58.5N 81°44'01.4W I saw clear as day a diamond shaped object with a blunted rear.  Large cylindrical shaped matte green lights were similar to doughnut shaped circles that were phosphorescent but did not emit any light pollution outside of the light itself or within the center.  I believe this was caused due to a magnetic field as the light would normally have emitted a void within the center.  It was not far I would estimate 500ft up at most or whatever the ceiling height of the cloud cover was.  About 200 ft away to the SW.  Size of about six houses maybe as large as twelve in mass.  I was awestruck at the magnificence and engineering that went into it.  I could see the louver like body on the craft and the design was like plates were set similar to a red clay roof as if the heat was dispersed by the space behind each plate.  The sound may be in the video however my ac unit could have caused that.  I would pass any lie detector test on this I am 100% certain of what I saw. I am going to do my best to have an image rendered.  I could pass a lie detector test on this. I was not open minded on this and grew up in Bermuda.  I am now very interested and am setting cameras up to record any anomalies. I have video however it may need some editing to be able to get a clear view of what I saw. When I saw it it rolled right and turned slightly leaving my sight.  It was clear as day.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
UFO sighting - detailed - close up;2017-10-13 03:47:00;10 seconds;UFO sighting - detailed - close up I was standing outside and looked up to see the most magnificent engineering feat my eyes have had the pleasure of witnessing.  The structure, design, and detail I was able to see with the moon out as bright with the angle it hit it was amazing.  The engines had a green matte color and emitted not light pollution outside of the doughnut shaped engine looking halos. I could see louver like plates seemingly used to disperse heat possibly.  I saw little of the top only the side and rear as it made a slight roll to the right and into the distance above the treeline.  The UFO was about 500 ft away at most and the size of about 24,000 sq ft+ .  I pulled my cell phone out to take video and when I did my eyes were blinded by the light of my phone screen.  I used the phone to record but I got no video just all black. I recored another video for a control video thirty minutes after since I was seeing no footage and I could see the clouds where the object was.  I was not a believer before I saw one and now I can say I have a new interest indeed.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
