Rotating Saucer Shaped Object with Multicolored Lights Flying Over Jacksonville;1976-06-01 20:30:00;2 minutes;Rotating Saucer Shaped Object with Multicolored Lights Flying Over Jacksonville I have debated whether I should share this story or not, but this has bothered me for almost 31 years.  Although time has faded my memory of the exact date and time of this event.  I will attempt to re-account my sighting.  I was around 7 years old at them and it was in the evening perhaps in the spring/summer of 1976 and my parents, younger brother and I had stopped by a local McDonalds for a bite to eat.   We were eating inside our car in the parking lot when both my brother and I noticed a low flying rotating object flying over a strip mall across the street.  My parents dismissed it as an airplane or helicopter or something rationale, since Cecil Field was very close to this area,  but my brother and I were just fixated on this object!   The object was maybe 400-600 ft. up in the air as it flew over this strip mall moving from left to right in our field of vision.  The object was circular with multicolored lights (red, green, blue, etc.) around its edges, it rotated like a carousel with a slight tilt to the right and angled facing us so you could see it was circular.  I could see all the individual lights and the object itself rotating clockwise.  The object also had a single light on the top that illuminated a little bit of the surface around it.   We did not hear any noise that would suggest an airplane, helicopter or blimp.  We eventually lost sight of this object, but I was left very shaken and the event has remained etched in my mind ever since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

I marked it off as a water tower. about 1mi. I came to another well lighted lot and saw the same object. color was like a tan or rust toned stainless steel. No noise. The object was moving west, same direction of which I was traveling. Could only see it while passing those two lighted lots. It was less than 100 feet off ground. I have been back to the area, there are no water towers nor any thing else to explain what this hugh object could be. Flat on bottom, angled slightly up to a flatter surface, then angled up much much more to the top.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Witnessed saucer from afar glowind with white lights, constantly diming and disapearing ever so often.;2005-06-11 00:10:00;30 minutes;Witnessed saucer from afar glowind with white lights, constantly diming and disapearing ever so often. I dont believe in UFO's or aliens or any far-fetched things of that nature. I woke up at around 12:00am from some sort of noise that is too hard to describe. For the first time in as long as i have lived in my house (5 years), i opened my blinds. Instantly i saw a disk or saucer glowing with white lights in the sky. It must have been very distant because it was very small. The lights would become very bright and then dim so that it was invisible. This went on for about 30 minutes, while i tried to figure out how to turn the flash off of my parents new digital camera. I feel ashamed that i didnt wake them up upon this event in order to perserve my pride. I am an Honor student at Stanton College Preparatory HighSchool. # 1 magnet school in the nation. That said, i still dont believe in UFO's but i have seen many aircrafts fly by my location, this one was floating in the same position almost glowing for that period of time. I did not take any medication of any type, nor have i ever taken a drink or illegal substance in my entire life. (I am 16). Thank you, i hope i will find someone else in my area who has also recalled this event.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Disc shaped saucer seen inside a glowing orange ball of light in Jacksonville, florida.;2012-04-29 02:00:00;2:00;Disc shaped saucer seen inside a glowing orange ball of light in Jacksonville, florida. My Husband and I were out in our backyard.  We see an orange glowing ball of light  - kind of reminiscent of fire.  It was moving towards us at first and got to about 1/4 of a mile away.  The craft was approiximately 500 feet up and we could see a definite saucer shaped craft encased within the orange glowing sphere. It almost seemed like a hologram but was not.  Once it got to about 1/4 mile from us, it turned and continued to go fairly slowly around the tree tops and out behind our property where it disappeared.  This craft was completely soundless.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Bright disc spotted over east Jacksonville near 295, with aircrafts following.;2014-01-26 21:00:00;6 minutes;Bright disc spotted over east Jacksonville near 295, with aircrafts following. Was outside taking out the trash and saw a strange light in the sky. I had my phone on me so I called my wife who was in the house and told her to get outside.  She was standing by the garage and I was walking back towards the house (about 90 feet).  My neighbor was also outside.  It appeared to be moving towards the ground, vertically towards the area where we live, then prior to it disappearing it moved back towards the sky.  It was bright and disk shaped, no sounds were present. It stayed in one place for a few seconds and then would move erratically in a chaotic pattern, but with no recognizable signature to identify it by any means.  It was not an aircraft, because immediately as this was happening we heard two jets (aircraft of jet-like origin) moving towards the object.  We tried to video tape this with the camera phone but it was too dark, and would not be sufficient for what we saw.  After we heard the jets coming towards the area of the object, it shot ac! ross the sky and disappeared.  The jets continued to make loud noise, but soon after were gone as well.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

Disc shaped object seen in the middle of the afternoon.;2014-10-05 16:00:00;2-3 minutes;Disc shaped object seen in the middle of the afternoon. Driving north on highway 17 (Roosevelt blvd) at about 4pm just past NAS Jax towards my left (East) I would say maybe 2 or 3 miles away was a large probably disk shaped object (about the size of my Galaxy s4 held at arms length.  I was traveling at about 60 mph and could not tell if this object was stationary or moving but I think stationary.  I saw it a few times through the tree line until I reached San Juan ave. then it was just gone.   When I first saw it it was level and the last time I saw it it was at about a 15 degree incline (no idea if it was facing down or up as the shape was very uniform).   I was not the only driver to see it as I noticed other drivers trying to get a picture of it (I tried but was unable to get it without stopping and there was too much traffic to just stop).  I honestly have no idea what this thing could have been.   This just happened 25 minutes ago and I fine with you contacting me if you need to.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
