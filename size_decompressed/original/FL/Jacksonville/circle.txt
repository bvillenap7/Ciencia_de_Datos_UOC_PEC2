It was;1974-02-15 22:00:00;5 minutes;This happened a long time ago but I never officially reported it. I just read Leslie Kean’s book and decided to do so. I was 16. It was a week day night. It was cold. I went out with a prospective boyfriend to hand out and drink a disc pack. We also had some marijuana. We kept getting chased away from the usual places so we ended up in an area of sand dunes that is between The city and the beaches. Not far from Craig Field. He was trying to get the car unstuck from the sand going back and forth when I looked up from the front windshield and saw a round hovering craft with colored lights blinking around the outer edge.  I called my companion’s attention to it. He saw it too. We both stared at it for a moment and then it took off very low over the dunes. It made no noise and did not stir up any sand. We got out of the car and tried to run in the direction it went. That was not easy and we soon got winded. We decided to go to a high area to see if we could see ! anything. We did but there was nothing in sight. We sat down to catch our breath and smoke a joint. We were probably about a mile from the car and could sat looking back in that direction. Shortly two other vehicles entered the du es from the road we used to enter. We initially saw only the headlights. They had to be 4 wheel drive to travel on the dunes. We kept watching and they kept coming towards us. Until we became alarmed. They were clearly aiming for us and traveling pretty fast. They both came up the dune where we were sitting and I ran. I think he did too. I was blinded by the lights. They may have used spot lights. I ran down the dune into a wet area and fell down getting icky water and stuff all over. The cars which looked like black Jeep’s kept going in the direction that the craft went without stopping. My companion was not pleased with my wet swampy self getting in his car and he drove me home in silence. I did not see him again for a number of months. It was w! arm the day. I immediately started reminiscing about what happ! ened. He said he did not remember anything that happened that night. He remembered picking me up but nothing else. The pot was. It that good and we had two beers apiece. I never saw him again.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Completely Silent Small UFO with Spotlight Illuminated my bedroom durring early morning.;1998-06-20 03:30:00;5s-10s;Completely Silent Small UFO with Spotlight Illuminated my bedroom durring early morning. Early one morning, I awoke sometime between 3-4am. I found it disturbing because I could not determine the reason I had awoken. I did not usually wake for no reason. I felt alert and full of adrenaline. I then noticed my old cat looking at something outside. This itself would normally be very odd. She was old and almost blind. She never focused on anything including me. That is when a spotlight illuminated my room for an instant moving from N to W. My room had 3 large (4 ft tall, 1.5 ft wide) windows facing directly south and one window facing west. I quickly pulled my blinds up on 2 of the south facing windows hoping to catch a glimpse of it. My house is close to Cecil field airbase and our house was directly in the path of P-31 Orions on landing approach which normally fly E to W. They never illuminated my room. Sometimes, our local Sheriff  helicopters fly over too which is what I expected to see. They had illuminated my room before but they flew higher, their light was not as blinding, and they tended to fly in circles which this did not do. They also tended to make noise. I was surprised to see a dark circular craft hovering over some nearby tree lines. There was no sound. None. It had an Extremely bright spotlight which was very Blue in color. The craft was moving NNW and its path took it just past my house and past my backyard. I estimated the craft to be hovering at a very low altitude. 50-75 feet above the ground. As it moved, it was also moving its spotlight. After I had opened my blinds, the light had been refocused at the street 60 feet away (South of me) and just to the right of the craft straight down. Again, if facing my house from the north, to the right of my house and south 50 feet on our street. It moved the light quickly north, then northwest and then again into my bedroom where it then stayed (obscuring my view of the craft for most of its time within my vision) focused on me as the UFO moved towards, and then past my house. I would estimate its speed at 20 mph.I tri! ed looki ng through my west facing window and watched the light as it moved to the neighbor's house directly behind mine and then northward out of view. I never heard of other reports and did not bring it up because it greatly disturbed me. I didnt sleep the rest of the night. I cannot stress how errie it was that there was no sound at all. Were there sound, everything about the incident would scream normal sheriff helicopter activity. There was just absolutely no sound at all, completly silent, and it seemed much lower than I normally observed local helicopters.

Bright red light in the sky turns into U.F.O. with circular shape and rotating lights.;2002-01-28 23:03:00;1min.30sec.;Bright red light in the sky turns into U.F.O. with circular shape and rotating lights. My husband and daughter stepped outside to view the full moon, only to observe what appeared to be a bright red light in the sky.  This red light blinked out and a circular ship with bluish-green and white rod-like rotating lights appeared in it's place. They yelled for me to come and see it, and at first it followed a similar flight path to the space shuttle when it goes by our house, but much faster.  Then it dropped down suddenly closer to the horizon, until we could see it no longer.  My husband is an Engineer at the military base and has always been skeptical about this kind of thing, but this morning he's asking alot of questions.  My daughter was frightened and wondered if it had something to do with the war. I didn't see the original red light, but it was a U.F.O. with rotating lights around it's perimeter.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
I observed an object with a peculiar flight path and unusual lighting characteristics.;2002-04-27 21:58:00;4 seconds;I observed an object with a peculiar flight path and unusual lighting characteristics. I went outside to investigate whether some rumblings I was hearing was a storm approaching or just a military exercise off in the distance. It was just a military exercise as the sky was quite clear. As I was looking around in the sky for signs of any approaching storm I noticed a bright light that moved at a fairly quick pace (I would estimate the speed of the object to be a little faster than a fighter jet). At first I thought that this was an airplane approaching me directly as the intensity of the light would have been about right. But I quickly ruled this out as the object moved along a perfectly vertical path. I would estimate the object to have been somewhere in the range (+/- a couple miles) of 5 miles from my position. The object rose rapidly in altitude and then came to an abrupt stop. The distance it traversed was about just over a foot (estimating 15 inches) in about 1 second. The light then disappeared for about 1/2 second. When the light came back on the object was about 4 inches above where I last spotted it. The object then remained stationary for 1 to 2 seconds. At this point the intensity of the light was about the same as when I first noticed it. The light then began to change. It started dimming until it again disappeared. As the light dimmed it seemed that the object became smaller but this could have been due to the reduction in the intensity of the light. The light then reappeared (the object still had not moved) with the same intensity as it had at the begining and the dimming sequence was repeated except at a much quicker pace. I called my wife outside and continued to look for the object to reappear. After observing for about 5 minutes and seeing nothing unusual we went back inside.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

Because of a somewhat similar report from Puyallup, WA, for January 28,  we have elected to post this report, despite the missing date.

The objects appeared in the photo, after I took away the darkness of the sky.;2003-04-04 06:00:00;20 seconds or less;The objects appeared in the photo, after I took away the darkness of the sky. I took this photo, of the sky before sunrise, cause I like to take sunrise and pre sunrise photos.  I used the flash on my camera, and noticed some white spots that showed up, on the film, even though I couldn't see the white circles or spots with the naked eye. I took the digital photo into Photoshop 6, a software program, adjusted the brightness and contrast, which I normally do to a lot of photos, and all these circles showed up. I think they're just stars, but, my mother has been after me to send these photos into you guys. So, what do you think, just stars that showed up after I lightened the digital image? ((NUFORC Note:  We have reviewed the photos, and they do not appear to be UFO-related to us.  We suspect that the flash illuminated dust particles, or else there are water droplets on the lense of the camera.  PD));30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
2 orange balls traveling over Jacksonville Florida;2010-12-31 23:45:00;1-2 minutes;2 orange balls traveling over Jacksonville Florida I saw 2 orange circles traveling from South to North.  I live southeast of Jacksonville by 10 miles, and their path was west of me by approximately 1-2 miles.  They travelled approximately 10 miles from south to north during my observation.  They were not at exactly the same altitude but were fairly close.  They had no blinking lights and made no sound.  They looked almost like you would expect after-burners to look on a jet fighter, but there was no sound at all.  The size of the light was too big to come from an airplane, and the speed at which they traveled was too fast for a helicopter.  I’m not sure what these were, but they looked very similar to those I found on youtube videos when I searched for “Orange UFO”.

Bright meteor-like object falling from upper left sky to lower right quickly changed directions and disappeared over the horizon;2011-02-24 19:50:00;2-3 seconds;Bright meteor-like object falling from upper left sky to lower right quickly changed directions and disappeared over the horizon Sighting occurred in the NE area of Jacksonville, FL about ¼ mile SE of intersection of Yellow Bluff Rd and Starratt Rd while looking directly NE towards Amelia Island thru a large picture window in my house, and at about a 60 degree angle from horizon. One object appearing like an orange and yellowish round fireball, or meteor-like, started rapidly falling from upper left portion of window (about 10 o’clock on a watch dial) towards the lower right of the window (or about 4 o’clock).  After dropping to about 20 degrees off of the horizon to the lower right of my window, the object very quickly changed direction and shot off slightly to the right and away and disappeared over the horizon in kind of a bow shaped pattern following the contour of the earth at about 20 to 30 degrees. I would estimate the distance to the object was initially several miles from my viewing location, and was 15 to 20 miles away before disappearing over the horizon.  It initially appeared about the size of a golf ball from my vantage point, but was very small when it shot off and away to the right.  Total viewing time was a matter of a few seconds.  My wife was with me, but her back was facing the object when it appeared, and object was out of sight before she could turn to take a look at it. Event occurred the same night as the last launch of the Space Shuttle Discovery from Kennedy Space Center.  I have lived near Naval Air Stations in San Diego, and now Jacksonville, FL, and have observed numerous military aircraft, but have never seen an object like this, and seen it move and change directions so quickly.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Orange Lights in the Jacksonville Sky;2011-10-22 16:00:00;5 minutes;Orange Lights in the Jacksonville Sky My husband and I were driving home towards the Wonderwood bridge area in Jacksonville FL., when we saw no less that 20 orange spheres in the sky, which were symmetrical. At first I thought it was just the lights on the power lines.  Then I saw one of the lights turn to a brighter orange and pick up speed and move at a fast pace across the sky off into the distance.  While the other ones were a paler orange and they remained in the same spot.  If they were moving it was not at a fast pace.

This night in particular I was walking from my car to my house and stopped to admire the clear night sky.  I had seen a few helicopters over the water which is common because I live near a base and it's not unusual.  I had seen two on my right over the water and heard the helicopters I could clearly tell what those were. Less than a minute later I saw what I thought was a plane high up moving over my house.

It slowly faded out as it went into the distance.  At first I though it to be space junk burning up in the atmosphere , but because of the direction it was moving I don't think that is possible.  There are no launches down at the Cape so it wasn't that either.  To give aspect on the direction, if staring at the cape the object started about 75 degree to the right and ended about 20 degrees to the right.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
