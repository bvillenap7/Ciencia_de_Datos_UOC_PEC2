An very similar sighting to the one reported over Phoenix this year happened over Jacksonville in 1992.;1992-06-15 01:00:00;3 min;Summary : An very similar sighting to the one reported over Phoenix this year happened over Jacksonville in 1992. On the early morning of June 15, 1992 while lounging in a swimming pool with my cousin and father,  my cousin first noted seeing the formation.  He gasped in disbelief when he (we) saw an approaching string of large white lights coming at us from the west heading to the east directly over the city of Jacksonville FL.  The row of lights (7 or 8) were evenly spaced and at the same hieght.  As they approached us they went straight up into the sky and while going up formed the shape of a large V.  The V continued to go straight up into the sky until it was almost completed out of sight when a flash of light from either the horizon or ground shot up at the formation in an waverly line followed by a second streak of light.  We all sat there dumbfounded by the sighting.  My cousin who is a pilot stated that the light formation was not that of any plane over the US. and the entire time the formation made no heard sound. We all three never really pushed the issue until I had seen film footage of the sighting over Phoenix this year and what was filmed was almost exactly what we had seen.  Now I believe.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Triangular formation of lights observed in a telescope, moving from west to east.;2003-05-05 21:22:00;2 min;Triangular formation of lights observed in a telescope, moving from west to east. While observing M-44 (an open star cluster in Cancer) earlier this evening with a 60 mm refractor, I noticed a triangular grouping of lights that moved directly across this large cluster, from west to east, as I watched.  Luckily, I was able to sweep the telescope across the sky so as to follow this group for several minutes until it moved into trees to the east.  At the time, I was using a wide-field, low power ocular [25 X, approx. two degree field of view] on a telescope with an altazimuth mounting, so it was realtively easy to observe and track the object(s) as they moved across the sky.  I live in an urban location (Jacksonville) with a good bit of background sky glow.  In addition, this evening there was a waxing crescent moon in the sky, and some light haze and clouds, so that there is no chance that I would have noticed this phenomenon had I not been using a telescope.  What I observed appeared to be three, point-like lights, perhaps no brighter than fourth magnitude stars, moving together in a tight pattern that resembled a foreshortened isosceles triangle.  The long axis of the group was approximatley three quarters of a degree.  While watching the grouping of lights move across the sky in the telescope, I was impressed by the fact they seemed to move in perfect fromation, keeping the same visual aspect and reminding me of nothing so much as the three illuminated corners (running lights) of a solid, trinagualr object seen from an oblique perspective.  Curiously, as I followed this group of three lights in the telescope, there was no observed occultation of stars as it passed in front of them, despite the very strong visual impression (illusion?) that I was watching a dark, solid object move across the sky.  As for direction and duration, the group was moving from west to east, and traversed the distance from Cancer to the vicinity of Ursa Major (obscured by trees) in less than two minutes.  [These are actual compass directions in a telescope's star diagonal, east and west are, of course, reversed.]  If I had to guess, I'd say that I was observing a cluster (?) of satellites.  I an pretty well used to seeing individual satellites in binoculars and -- ocasionally -- in a telescope, and these objects had all of the characteristis of such.  Also, depending on their height (if they were indeed satellites), the timing of their passage relative to the location of the day-night line for my location seems to indicate that they should have been visible.  Pretty darned impressive, whatever they were! ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have witnessed the three U. S. Navy NOSS satellites, but we have not been able to confirm that fact, yet.

Formation of 9 orange lights;2009-09-19 22:00:00;5 Minutes;Formation of 9 orange lights I saw 9 orange lights around 10pm in a V formation flying east very quickly.  Normally I would say it was a flock of geese but they were too high and flying too quickly to be geese.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Orange 5 ufo formation.;2016-04-23 22:30:00;25 minutes;Orange 5 ufo formation Driving south on Monument road towards intersection with Fort caroline road, a half a mile away from same I saw 5 orange spherical lights in horizontal bow like formation flying away from me. I started recording, and I passed them by directly underneath the last 2 crafts, no sound was recorded being this lights as high as or lower than a helicopter, no blue and red blinking lights were seen or recorded by camera, I turned at the end of Monument and turned right on caroline road, entering to my left the front yard of a church Stoped but the lights dispersed and only one remained static, but I was unable to get a good angle, so took on Monument Ave.  In the oposite direction going north, I captured 2 lights at the time moving, static, more coming behind in pairs up 3 or 4 more occasions, my engine blinking lights, passing by cars and even a woman's voice conversing with a male as well could be heard from the other side of the Monument road/blvd..  Though farther away while still recording, no sound was recorded of this objects, which moved slowly to finally slowly dimming its orange glow light to finally disapeared I've heard helicopters even athough a needle point view distance, have 16 segments of short videos lasting over 20 minutes. One more thing , a small blue light at the beginning trailing passing them by and later guiding them in the oposite direction as if reacting to my observations was only viewed in my review of the video, it was invisible to the naked eye.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Very dark Gray craft heading west on a direct path. Object appeared to turn into 3 shapes and then back into one solid object again.;2017-06-01 20:00:00;4 minutes;Very dark gray craft heading west on a direct path.  Object appeared to turn into 3 shapes, and then back into one solid object again.  Very hard to describe.   It was moving quickly west.  Seemed to pulse and change shape with regular intervals.   Object appeared to have a circular force field around it almost like heat distortion in a transparent circle around it.  The circle of distorted air shifted and was not there the entire time.   It was completely silent.  No lights, no sound.  Object was mesmerizing.   Object looked very complex, no reflection, not metallic looking.  Flat and almost back.   Morphing 3 objects and then into one solid straight line, over and over as it flew by overhead.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

They were not normal satellites and were not the Starlink since they have around 60 satellites in that train link I call it.  This had only around 8 of them and just soon as they were going over my place, they disappeared in thin air.  I was only able to see them for a min or so each time one came over. They were in a line formation heading East of where I live, but spread out.  Also around that same time a bigger white orb that was pulsating was flying over and heading South and seen 2 flashes of what looked like a strobe light just randomly flash, but I didn't see an object where it could have been coming from.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Just Before Sunrise a formation of 15 to 30 what appeared to be satellites were evenly spaced appeared.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-02-05 06:24:00;3-4 minutes;Just Before Sunrise a formation of 15 to 30 what appeared to be satellites were evenly spaced, appearing directly overhead and disappearing at the Horizon moving Northeast approximately halfway across the distance of the sky.  All traveling at the same speed and only two or three flaring out at the end just above the horizon.  First there was a group of approximately 10 to 15, with a short break a second group appeared with approximately 15 more all on the same trajectory;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
