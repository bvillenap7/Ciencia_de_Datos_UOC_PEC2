It appeared to be a very bright and large shooting star falling downwards with a trail;2003-10-20 20:38:00;3-4 seconds;It appeared to be a very bright and large shooting star falling downwards with a trail I have never seen anything like this, nor have I ever even considered UFO's. Monday night as I was leaving Wal-Mart near I-295 in Jacksonville, Florida, I saw a bright flash trailing downward like a shooting star.  I was on my cell phone when it happened and remarked on it to my friend.  When I got home I told my husband about it.  I told him to check the news to see if an airplane went down because it happened right near where Jacksonville International Airport is.  I was about 5 miles south of the airport.  But this was NO plane.  I didn't think anything else about it until I read on Compuserve news about the sighting in Durham.  I remember looking at my watch when I was walking out of Wal-mart and it was 8:35...so, I figure it was around 8:37-8:39 pm when I saw it.  Again, I do not take these kind of things seriously, but was shocked when I read the Durham account.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

Object entering southeastern Florida atmosphere at high velocity- NOT SPACE SHUTTLE;2007-11-10 20:00:00;3-5 Minutes;Object entering southeastern Florida atmosphere at high velocity--NOT SPACE SHUTTLE Leaving my home for a late evening bike ride I noticed an object several feet above the treeline entering our atmosphere in the southeastern sky. I was confident that I was watching the space shuttle Discovery returning form it's mission. I watched as it streaked along the sky at a slow pace with what seemed to be sparks and embers trailing behind. It glowed orange and then red and back to a dark orange. After a few minutes it decended below the treeline where I could not see it. It also appeared to be losing its color. There were several aircraft that seemed to be in the vicinity so again I felt it was a normal shuttle landing. I just read that the shuttle landed around 1:00pm versus this event that I witnessed around 8:00pm. I have contacted several news outlets that have also had recent calls regarding this strange object. I have never seen something like this and wasn't unhinged about it until I found out it wasn't our space shuttle returning home. ((NUFORC Note:  The Space Shuttle had landed on November 05th, 2007.

It was a hugh bright bluish-greenish object traveling the tree line from east to west.;2008-09-24 22:35:00;7 seconds;It was a hugh bright bluish-greenish object traveling the tree line from east to west. I live in NE Florida.  My neighborhood is by the river, and is known for it's big, mature trees.   My lot faces the northeast, so when I went out back Wednesday night, 9/24/08, around 10:30 PM, I was looking up into the southwestern sky.  The view is surrounded by tree tops.  It was a clear night, and I could see stars.   The object came into my view as fast as it left.  I was able to watch until it disappeared behind some trees, approximately 7 seconds.  It looked like the pictures you see of meteors going across the sky, except this was at tree level, about the size of an average house in prospective to the trees, and was silent.  It was bright bluish-greenish in the front and red in the back, traveling from east to west.   I waited there in astonishment, waiting to hear a crash.  I was unraveled and ran inside to call our local TV station to report it. The next day, as I was explaining it to my neighbor, his teenage son saw it too!  He works around the corner from our home, and saw it from the window at his work place. He thought it was going down on the gas station across the street from him.  He didn't hear it either.  We are just wandering if anything was reported or if anyone else seen it too.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

I called the rest of the family and we all stood on our deck and watched.  It was very surreal as it appeared we were being invaded!   I'm guessing they were flares, but I'm not sure now that I've seen so many similar reports.  I'd say they were each about the size of Venus or Jupiter on a good night, reddish/orange, solid (no blinks) and just seemed to dissipate like a flare might.  But there were at least 15-18 total that we saw in about a 2 minute period, really.  They just kept coming, one set behind the other.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

Strange Row of Lights Over Jacksonville, Fl.;2014-02-09 02:00:00;3-5 minutes;Strange Row of Lights Over Jacksonville, Fl My sister and I were coming home at approximately 2 am.  I noticed a row of maybe 5 red lights in the sky that were so perfectly vertical that at first I thought it was a constellation.  Then I noticed another red light approaching the row from the left of the others and it joined the row at the bottom.  That's when I turned off the radio and asked my sister if she thought the lights in the sky were as strange as I did.  She agreed, so I grabbed my phone and we fumbled nervously to record what we saw.  Besides the fact that my sister didn't know how to work the video camera on my phone, the lights were difficult to record because they seemed to move without really moving.  I don't know how to explain it. Once they were in a row, the lights turned from red to orange and kept changing colors.  They never seemed to move but somehow disappeared.  We never heard any noises like we would have if it was a plane or several planes, which we hear often because we live in between a navy base and a commerce center for private/commercial planes. When we got home, I called the non emergency line for our sheriffs office to inquire if there had been any other reports.  I was told no but they would send out an officer if I wanted to file a report.  I declined the report.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

Since this was New Year's Eve, I thought the object was some fireworks but had no sound.   I slowed down to look at object ahead of me and I noticed the two other objects, a total of 3.  Being in  communication technologies I thought it was a radio tower but realized there were no towers by the house in this direction.  They were in a triangle formation.   The object that was flaming was the top left (east) of triangle.  The other two, one was to the right (west) horizontal to the flaimng one.  The third was below the other 2 and in a center position.   As  I turned left there were several couples with children walking , they were all looking and pointing at the objects.

People walking on Blanding blvd were also looking and pointing at the object too.  I was not the only one who saw this.  The flaming one stayed stationary till I reached the next light.
