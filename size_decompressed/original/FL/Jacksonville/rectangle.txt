A rectangle shape object like a cigar box (maybe three times the size) touched down in my back yard.  ((NUFORC Note:  Hoax??  PD));2000-01-02 00:00:00;2hrs;A rectangle shape object like a cigar box (maybe three times the size) touched down in my back yard one night about 1 or 2 am.  My (then wife) wife and I watched it for over 2 hours through the bathroom window it was near the privacy fence of a neighbor but on our side.  It had lights of un- imaginable colors that were going crazy at first when it touched down.  It started running the lights in some kind of sequence and then another.  I was not scared but rather kind of calm as if I knew what they were doing.  They have the ability to increase and reduce their craft shape and they use lights to repair things.  When it ran the last sequence of lights it seems to click in place and it disappeared.  The next day there were no signs in the yard where it was of any kind.

There was no sound and we see a lot of jets and passenger planes in this area of the southside of Jacksonville, Fl. I cannot estimate the height but it was clear and NO sound. Object was going north to south. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone at length, and she sounded quite credible to us.  PD));30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
very low hovering black rectangular object on a sunny day;2004-06-30 15:00:00;several minutes;very low hovering black rectangular object on a sunny day walking dog in business park area in the afternoon, observed a very low flying black rectangular object, with several colored lights on the tip of the corner closest to me.  object hovered slowly and continued from NE to SW until disappearing past the treeline.  there was absolutely no sound and it appeared to be several stories high and about 5 stories long.  on the corner i saw sunlight defract against the material, and it was shimmery or segmented like shuttle tiles.  i live very near an airfield by this business park, and there is a large military presence in this community.  the object was too low, too big, too dark, and too quiet on a sunny afternoon to be a trick of the eye, but no one passed on the busy street for the duration so that i could compare stories... just with the dog who stared also!

I have 20/15 vision and could see a better picture than than my 8MP camera.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

The U.F.O was moving at rate faster than any plane or aircraft I've seen.  The object had a light blue aura surrounding it, the aura had a tail as well.  The tail was about 1/5 of total lenth. It appeared rectangular with a rounded front. It stared from the north west traveling south west. When it passed the rear seemed to have two white lights emitting out from it.  Appeared to be similar to a torch flame. 30 - 40 seconds later we heard a low grumble.  Shorty after seeing the U.F.O planes began to cross hatch the sky.  There was approximately 5 - 8 planes in a large spread over the close area of the sighting.  The planes then moved further out and back over the area for a time more than 30 minutes;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
Football field-sized aircraft with bight, green lights hovered for 2,5 minutes.  Video shows lights flashing like sending a code.;2015-12-21 20:23:00;2.25 minutes;Football field-sized aircraft with bight, green lights hovered for 2,5 minutes.   Video shows lights flashing like sending a code. Large aircraft (size of a football field) with bright, greenish lights rose from behind the trees and hovered in the same spot for almost 2.5 minutes.  The aircraft appeared and disappeared at a high rate of speed, faster than any aircraft I am aware of while working in the aerospace industry.   Although the lights appeared to the naked eye to be solid and not blink, the video shows white lights blinking intermittently as if they were sending a code.   The two people I have shown the video to are a retired federal agent and defense subcontractor which both have stated the aircraft was not of this world.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
