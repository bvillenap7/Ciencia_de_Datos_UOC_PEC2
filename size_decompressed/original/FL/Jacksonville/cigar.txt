Some type of rocket launch.;2013-12-04 10:30:00;10 minutes;some type of rocket launch I was outside yesterday at approximately 10:30 AM.  We heard a loud noise that sort of sounded like a jet.  But it went on so long that I started looking for it.  Then, to me, it started sounding more like a rocket.  I looked in the direction of the Kennedy space center as I often watch launches from there.  And there was indeed what looked like a rocket.  I enjoy trying to catch the take offs from my area when the weather is nice.  So I am usually familiar with what is taking off when because I try to watch for them.  (And sometimes photograph them)  I remembered that SpaceX had tried to take off early in the week and had been delayed but I thought it took off that night before on Dec. 3.    When I got home I did searches and could NOT find anything about any launches at Kennedy. I also checked the schedule of launches from Kennedy and other than one later this month there was nothing scheduled after the Dec. 3 SpaceX launch that had happened the night prio! r.  So after lots of digging I have yet to find anything about this launch.  My guess is it's unpublished NASA launch of a spy satellite or something.  But it definitely was a rocket launch and looked very much like it would if it were from Kennedy Space center. Also immediately after there seemed to be a lot of activity at the NAS Jax. (Tons of military jet planes) The area I was in 32256 is very close to the NAS base (just across the river from it), however, the launch was coming from the coast in the South eastern direction.  Again this is the exact direction I have previously watched many NASA launches. I did find, after lots of digging this video-http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgRzshn_8QI&list=FLgk_WMPAW3xQhP2N9OtTnMA&index=1 .  It sounds and looks just like the launch I witnessed.  (Although I witness, obviously, from a much greater distance).  It was LOUD though even from our area.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828

An unusual aircraft suddenly appeared, displaying bright red and orange lights, then shot skyward and disappeared.;2020-01-15 19:00:00;1 minute;An unusual aircraft suddenly appeared, displaying bright red and orange lights, then shot skyward and disappeared. The object was moving slowly across the sky, parallel to the ground north to south, for about 45-55 seconds.  It was cigar shaped with bright red lights and a bright orange after-burner but there was no sound or noise.  Then, in a mater of seconds it appeared to change direction towards a 45 degree angle up and shot up and disappeared.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
