At approximately 10:22pm high above us in the sky above cloud level we witnessed a spherical egg shaped type object appear and then vanish within a few seconds.  It was an unusual bright yellow color unlike the bright white lights of normal flying objects.   Immediately we both knew we had witnessed something special and unique.  We knew it was something we could never forget.;30.2961661157026;-81.6329371900828
