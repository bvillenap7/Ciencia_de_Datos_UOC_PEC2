It happened in front of my house at 9:00 pm, March 4, 2016, and I have seen it the next three nights after that. It's shaped like a diamond, there are three of them one stays in the same place the others move around,and then I saw three flashes going through the sky, one in the day too I saw something go across the sky in the naked eye, it was silver, and it wasn't a plane.   I tried to get pics but all you see is a white circle in the pics, i blew one up and it looks green, the video clip I got you can see a white circle move a little ,but the flashes I can't get on video, the flashes same to go different directions.   I am so freaked out.  These are my first sightings ever!;29.0682;-81.8843
