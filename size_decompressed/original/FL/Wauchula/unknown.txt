At 20:00 my wife and I were sitting on our back pourch facing east when a very bright orange light appeared just above the tree line along the Peace River. This light rose up sharply and split into three seperate lights which can be described as a square/rectangular light,solid on the upper half of this rectangular with the bottom half open with a few horizontal bars goin across. These lights then slowly went out and a similar light would appear just above and angled over, then again fade out and re-appear at another angle. We had binnoculars but could not make out any kind of craft within this outline of lights as of yet. Within a few seconds there began a flurry of small white lights circling this larger pattern of lights and then moving rapidly out of this circular pattern. These smaller lights appras to have 2 rectangular lights that would blink every second or so. We watched this happen again a few minutes later in another part of the sky, Same bright orange light with it splitting into some kind of square light. The smaller white lights continued to travel in circular patter throughout the entire sky, Sometimes they appeared to change direction at any given moment. We were speachless for the rest of the evening and did not even speak to eachother about it untill this afternoon.;27.5553;-81.8085999999999
