...like insects near a light;1998-06-01 02:00:00;1 minute;...like insects near a light We were sitting on the beach late at night, behind us were 2 spotlights shining into the sky. I suppose it was a grand opening of some sort.  I turned around to look at them and noticed that there were several lights inside the beam. I thought to myself that they looked like bugs swarming around a flashlight beam.  It surprised me when the spotlight left them-they were still there! Only now we could tell that the objects were far away in the sky and were moving as if in a dog fight or something. They moved quickly in all directions.  After about 40 seconds they disappeared.;30.3498;-87.1655
