exploding/imploding and fading stars in Florida;2002-06-30 23:00:00;60+sec;exploding/imploding and fading stars in Florida (due to length of time since ive seen this I cant provide an accurate date of sighting)  A friend and I were walking west along the street we lived on around 11pm this night. As I was looking at the stars I noticed one started to grow larger, I gathered my friends attention and pointed it out to him. As we watched it the object continued to grow to about 5 times its origional size. After it had enlarged about 5-8 other spheres of light (looking similar to large stars) seemed to explode outwards from the origional light. After these lights spread outwards for about 10sec they imploded back into the origional light which then shrank back to the origional size of a star and then faded away. This first encounter lasted about 30 seconds and never made any sudden or quick movements. besides exploding and imploding it stayed in the same spot. After this sighting I was turning around to go back and grab my friends video camera when he convinced me not to.  About 1 minute later we were still watching the sky and we encountered the same exact lights again in the same part of the sky.  The lights were all the normal white (star) color  If any other person(s) has seen these objects in Florida I would greatly wish to be contacted. Any video or photos of these objects would be greatly appreciated!  Please Contact me via email    ((e-address deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

An  orange/yellow star-like cylinder with a hazy, glow transited Florida from SSE to NNW at 30 elevation on 10/12/04 @2327 EDT;2004-10-12 20:27:00;50-75 Seconds;An  orange/yellow star-like cylinder with a hazy, glow transited Florida from SSE to NNW at 30 elevation on 10/12/04 @2327 EDT At Approximately 8:27 PM EDT, Tuesday, October 12, 2004, I stepped out of my house to check the sky for clouds, anticipating a satellite pass, when I observed a -3/-4 magnitude star-type cylindrical object moving from south-east to north-west, 20 to 30 degrees above the horizon.  At first, I thought it was the ISS (International Space Station). It appeared to have the same orangish/white color as the ISS. I then noticed it had a haze or glow around it, and was LARGER in relative size than the ISS. The object tracked on a path similar to a satellite, but did not Feel the same. It dissappeared over the horizon to the north. The conditions were CAVU: Ceiling And Visibility Unlimited, with a sodium vapor street light 300 feet to my relative west. After checking the Marshall Space Flight Center's J-Pass Web Site (http://science.nasa.gov/RealTime/JTrack/3D/JTrack3D.html) for satellite overflights and found none near Florida, I called MacDill AFB in Tampa. The Duty Officer said they had no information on any missile tests or other activities, and would log my call.;27.0648787878788;-82.1887929292928

Pulsating, frantic moving  light barely misses collision with plane;2015-04-17 01:00:00;20 minutes;pulsating, frantic moving  light barely misses collision with plane Small, pulsating light seen just over tree line but up much higher, light frantically moved side to side and up and down but remained in the same general area.  Lights brightened and dimmed ranging from red to blue and occasionally purple, a plane was traveling right towards the light, but then when it seemed as though they would collide, the light moved out of the flight path, eventually it seemed to dim and stopped changing colors, then slowly faded.  both observers, are sober, with good eyesight.;27.0648787878788;-82.1887929292928
