3 orange red spheres over North Port, Florida.  ((anonymous report));2016-12-31 23:33:00;6 minutes;3 orange red spheres over North Port, Florida. December 31, 2016, starting at 11:33 pm until 11:39 pm.  Observed  first, a single brilliant, orange red sphere, then approximately 2 minutes later, 2 more of the same spheres flying side by side, following the same path as the first sphere.  They were initially spotted from the south east near Punta Gorda, Florida, heading northwest over North Port Florida. The speed was very fast and silent.  No visible vapor trails. Sky was clear with little street light interference.  The first sphere flew a direct, horizontal path then suddenly disappeared near the north border of North Port.  There were no clouds to camouflage the light.  Sphere was large enough and bright enough to be seen at a far greater distance than the point at which it disappeared. The 2 spheres that followed, initially flew the same fast and straight horizontal paths, then  suddenly started a rapid, narrow, zigzag, pattern, which lasted a few seconds.  They then resumed their direct high speed horizontal path and disappeared in the same spot the first sphere did. My tablet would not take helpful photos.
