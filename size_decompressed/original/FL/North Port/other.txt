Silver object without wings or noise;2012-10-19 19:00:00;5 minutes;Silver object without wings or noise Object was going North to South.  Object was shiny silver and made no noise whatsoever.  The object did not have wings like jet planes that fly over and make noise.  It also let out 2 small puffs of white smoke or something like smoke.  I watched this object till it went out of sight and I did not see any more puffs of smoke.  This object was going about as fast as a jet would go and the sun reflecting off of it is what caught my eye.  I have never seen anything like this in my life(60 years).;27.0648787878788;-82.1887929292928
A large ship slowly flew over my car.;2015-01-19 21:00:00;1 minute;A large ship slowly flew over my car. I'm now a believer after what I've witnessed a few days ago. It just started getting dark in the sky, I don't remember the time though.  But I'm driving towards the high way to go under the over pass for the high way, when I see 2 VERY bright yellowish lights in the sky.  They looked almost like car head lights but a lot brighter.  They appear stationary for awhile so I start thinking it's a cell phone tower or those tall street lamps we have in that area.  But as I drive closer, it vanished.   So I look forward and continue driving maybe about 10 seconds, and then this huge ship appears right over the tree line, and slowly moves over my car. It was going maybe 10-30mph but I couldn't tell because it was so large and so low to the ground.   When it flew over I couldn't really make out the shape, the bottom of the ship was so dark that I couldn't make out any type of patterns or designs under it as it appeared to be a reflective black paint or something.  But when it flew over it had 2 bluish lights under it. It looked like they were on the tip of each wing thing, and the lights were coming from a square window-like enclosure.  The blue lights did flash, but not in any type of pattern, it was almost like looking at metal in a microwave, but with all blue sparks.   It made no noise which confused me the most, there was also no rumbling or shaking.  I could see some of the wing where the lights would flash.  The lights that lit up around the wing did let me see some of the wing shape though and color.  From the little I saw, the ship's shape looked similar to that atlantis space shuttle.  The ship looked like it was following the highway, but next to it.   I'll provide a picture/map of the course I saw it flying on.  Sadly I do not own a cell phone, and the other people in the car were too in shock to respond quick enough to record it.   I usually hear stories of strange red lights in the sky in this area, but this goes way beyond thatâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
