PD)) I was heading out to work when I saw a bird-like winged object surrounded by a brilliant blue light moving across the sky, South by Southwest. At first I thought it was a comet until I noticed the shape. It grew in size as it moved, leaving a bluish white trail behind it until it no longer had a winged shape, but a tear drop shape. I recorded it with my phone although it was still night and my phone couldn't capture as much as what the naked eye could see. By the tielme I pulled over, other people were parked on the road recording it as well.;27.0648787878788;-82.1887929292928
