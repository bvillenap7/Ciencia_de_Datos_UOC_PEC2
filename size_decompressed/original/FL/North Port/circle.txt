Single UFO over Florida, June 13.;2007-06-13 23:00:00;10 Minutes;Single UFO over Florida, June 13. Date: 6/13/07 							 Location: Southwest Florida- South Sarasota County Time of Sighting: appox. 10:45 pm  When I was taking my dog out, I noticed a few fixed lights in the sky. The object was fairly far away and was not moving. It was much too high in the sky to be a helicopter. I called my parents out to look at the object. Already I was convinced this must be a UFO, because it was suspended in the sky and the lights were oddly very bright considering the distance of the object. My father brought his binoculars outside. When looking through the binoculars, I could make out three distinctive large windows which the light seemed to be coming from. I however could not make out the definite shape of the object, so I assuming that the object was darkly colored, as it was blending into the night sky. The perception of the three consecutive windows did however suggest that the object was circular. Both my mother and father and I watched the object for at least 5 minutes, taking pictures and such. Eventually, the object got smaller as it moved away.;27.0648787878788;-82.1887929292928

Approximately 50 red circles of lights, travelling in a northerly direction.  Some clusters variations in speed and position.;2016-02-02 20:15:00;30 minutes;Approximately 50 red circles of lights, travelling in a northerly direction.  Some clusters variations in speed and position.   Noticed approximately 50 red lights travelling from south to north in the western sky. Objects were silent, flew in slightly irregular patterns and there were several clusters of 4-5.   This continued for at least 20 minutes from when I first noticed them. I had my husband come out to witness this and he was as bewildered as me.  The circular red lights were all travelling in the same direction and at similar, but not exactly uniform speeds.  They all disappeared at a particular point in their travel northward.  It was hard to tell if perhaps they were obscured but cloud cover but we did notice that stars were still visible in the area where they were disappearing. Surely this was seen but many many others.  Hoping to hear news of what these actually were.;27.0648787878788;-82.1887929292928

In the center of was a black object. Made no sound. Lots of wind. I was sitting inside in my truck it was just getting dark then I saw these very small 2 blue lights heading right for me.  As it got closer, they separate and the wind was so strong the truck shook.  I know it sounds strange but they almost look like eyes. Black spot was in the center of the blue. no bigger than an egg.  They came back around me and took off in the sky faster than any thing I have every seen. I never took any photos so it just my word.  It happen in seconds.;27.0648787878788;-82.1887929292928

When I looked up, I saw what for a moment, looked like the Moon.  Then I saw a second round sphere.  These 2 round, white spheres hovered in the sky for about 3-4 mintes & just disappeared.  No flight up or down, just gone.  Very strange, as they where in the Western part of the sky.;27.0648787878788;-82.1887929292928
