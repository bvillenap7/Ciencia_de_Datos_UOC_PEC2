At appromately 3:00 am, heard dogs barking, after investigating why dogs were barking went outside and looked around, dogs were staring off in distance, when looked in that direction saw what appeared to be a plate shaped object over 400 feet in diameter, and had 5 multi colored lights each light emitted a varying array of colors from brown, white, and pinkish.  The object itself appeared to be a color I have never seen, it was a cross between neon yellow and charturese green.  After staring at the object for under a minute the object appeared to swallow itself, like an octopuses tenacles and move into the distance at speed of light, leaving all 5 lights to appear as one for a brief moment, then vanish all together, the sound as it did this was like a swift breeze with a small suction popping.;27.0648787878788;-82.1887929292928
Bright red lights with an unusal pattern in the evening sky.;2004-03-01 21:00:00;20 minutes;Bright red lights with an unusal pattern in the evening sky. A red object stayed stationary over the cloudy evening skies but yet this UFO showed itself clearly.  It went horizontal and vertical and often changed its unuasual pattern.  It looked like it had a tail of red lights, kind of like a meteor shower but just stayed in one spot.  Then all of a sudden, a second UFO appeared with a bright light facing the other one with an unusual pattern also.  Then within 15 minutes, it totally disappeared from the night sky and never reappeared back.  It was a very odd sight to see and it was something that not many people saw unfortuately at the time because we live in a very secluded area with many woods and no city lights.;27.0648787878788;-82.1887929292928
