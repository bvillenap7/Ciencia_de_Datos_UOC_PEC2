Three flame red flickering points of light in the sky, moving indep. of one another in triangle formation, then fading out.;2013-12-20 19:15:00;2 minutes;three flame red flickering points of light in the sky, moving indep. of one another in triangle formation, then fading out. ok, so i found this site while trying to figure out what i saw last night on my UPS route. conditions was full night time dark, starry sky with about 50% (city illuminated) clouds.  from my vantage point looking down a street with a cell tower beyond i saw three bright flame red/orange slightly flickering irregular lights of different intensities in an asymmetrical triangle formation above the cell tower (.5mi from my position). they gave the impression of little flames in the sky...  no idea if they were closer to me or further away, but definitely above the height of the tower.  they moved within the triangle formation independently for around two minutes and one by one faded out, whether the lights went out or disappeared in the cloud i cant say.  given the proximity to the hospital i at first thought maybe a bad crash on the nearby interstate 75 meant three inbound Bay flight birds, but after i shut off my truck there was no sound.  i've had this route now 2.5 years and even midday you can hear those helo's a mile off, they're very loud. i gotta say i was a tad spooked. just prior to this writing i read your report page, and a sighting from port charlotte (where i live and adjacent to north port) at the same time about a week ago reads almost word for word what i saw last night. quite spooky…;27.0648787878788;-82.1887929292928
I just witnessed a ‘Phoenix Lights’ type of formation of UFOs.;2019-10-02 20:03:00;20 seconds;10/2/19 @ 8:03PM EST  UFO SIGHTING in the 34287, FL area:  I just witnessed a ‘Phoenix Lights’ type of formation of UFOs.  I walked out tonight because a neighbor lost something in the grass and was walking with a flashlight looking for it. I noticed something strange very high about.  I did not have a chance to video tape it due to its speed.  It was very high up, miles into the ski.  It is about dark and I noticed it coming from West and going to the East. This was huge due to the size of the formation and how high it was.  Probably 10-15 white lights in a pointed wing shape.;27.0648787878788;-82.1887929292928
