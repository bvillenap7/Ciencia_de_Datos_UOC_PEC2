Fast moving Bright Light.;2010-09-26 22:00:00;20 sec;Fast moving Bright Light. I went outside to take my dog to go to the bathroom when I saw a very bright light.  I thought that maybe it was Venus because it was so Bright.  So I just keep staring at this light,which hurt my eyes very much but for some reason I could not stop watching it.I was there staring at this still light for about a minute or so.  Then all of a sudden the light starting moving up, until it disappeared.  That's when i realized it wasn't venus or a plane.  Planes usually move horizontal not vertical. SO I said to my self no this could not be possible and i shake it off when I see the same light except moving really fast but horizontal and it disappeared right before my eyes.  I didn't know what to do or think about what I had just seen before my eyes.;28.5817;-81.894
