Cigar shaped craft with backlit portholes;1997-03-01 00:00:00;30 seconds;I was driving down NW 190th Street in Marion County when I noticed a cigar shaped craft with backlit portholes moving slowly and quietly across a field.  It was close..about 150 feet away. It was very dark so I could not make out the materials it was made of.;29.5121;-82.3068
UFO appears in thunderstorm;2020-08-13 15:30:00;2 seconds;UFO appears in thunderstorm On the date and time stated in report details a severe thunderstorm was occuring.  To share the event I shot several videos of the event.  Upon sharing them with my wife on 08/15/20 we witnessed the craft traveling at a high rate of speed against the high winds of the storm.  It was moving from west to east well above the tree line.  It was hard to make out in the rain but made no noise.  This is first time we have ever witnessed anything like this and was quite suprising to see in a video of a storm.;29.5121;-82.3068
