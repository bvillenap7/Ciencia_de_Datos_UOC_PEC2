UFO sighted in downtown Tallahassee, Fl, boomerang shaped, scalloped, made of light...;2001-01-23 15:15:00;between 20 min and 45 min;UFO sighted in downtown Tallahassee, Fl, boomerang shaped, scalloped, made of light... The object that I saw was shaped somewhat like a boomerang or a croissant, and seemed to be made of light, for it was nearly as bright as the sun, but I did not have to squint to look at it.  It appeared to have a scalloped texture to it, and was quite large-I was viewing it from about a mile away, and it was as large as the sun.  This object was obscured by clouds that were slowly moving north, while it was moving gradually south at a slow pace, as if it was a cloud and not a giant boomerang made of light.  I was 16 when I saw this object, and had quite a nice view three stories up from a panoramic window in a public library.  There was one other person around sitting by the window, but she never looked up from her book.  There were also cloud formations near this object that were very strange.  To the north of the UFO was a perfectly circular hole in a very large cloud that hung over the northwestern part of the downtown area, and in the center of the hole it looked like a rocket had taken off and flown through the direct center of the hole and left a trail of emissions from behind.

Light Formations;2001-09-11 23:30:00;1 hour;Light Formations My husband and I went outside to smoke our last cigarette before bed and I was looking at how many stars were out, then I noticed one of them was moving.  I might not have taken notice of this except there were no planes supposed to be in the sky after the events of the day.  We initally noticed one light that was white and small, at first glance it looked like a star. It was due west. It was flashing not twinlking, one single white light then we could see three vertical lights, two white and the one in the center was red, the lights were in a row vertically.  It appeared to drop very quickly from what I assume to be a very high altitude and moved from side to side, almost insect like in it's movements. This is what raised the hairs on our necks, it was not swamp gas, a harrier jet or military planes, it's movements were like nothing I've ever seen. Ever. It continued to come down all the while flashing it's red light every so often. Finally it got to be too low in the tree line to see. Then after watching it for so long I noticed movement in the sky to the northwest, my husband and I identified this second object same as the first, it was moving in sequence with another light and another.  We made out three triangular formations in the sky comming from the north and going west. Each point of the triangle was a seperate moving and flashing entity.  Then it started to change into a circular pattern and the second light began the same descent pattern as the first.  This one appeared to be larger than the first, there was a quick white flash from it that went towards the other lights, we could tell they were headed away from us (west).  Eventually they became to small to watch and were gone.  There was no sound. Just as an after thought, at one point while watching the first light it became three lights and moved as if it went upside and back, more than once.  It was just the way it moved that set it apart from anything logical and reasonable.  My husband and I are not the type of people who go looking for this or frequent UFO websites but this was real and not of us.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
Large bright white light with a blue tail-roundish shaped but elongated.  Dropping vertically from the sky.;2002-01-16 21:30:00;1 minute;Large bright white light with a blue tail-roundish shaped but elongated.  Dropping vertically from the sky. My 3 children & I were driving home on Woodville Hwy when my son and I seen a large d ball of light dropping like a rock from the sky.  We watched it descend in less than a minute.  The best way to describe the shape is to say it looked like a ghost made out of sheet & flying upside down.  It was very bright and it had a light blue hue at the tail of it.  It was not moving diagnoly but vertically-straight down.  I called my mother(this was all within 15 minutes of spotting the object) when we reached home to tell her about it and while she was on the phone with me she also seen what she said was something as bright as the moon with a bluish hue and very large and solid falling by the woods off of Hwy 20.  She was freaking out and called my dad outside but he missed it by a second.  She also said that it was falling straight down like it was very heavy.  You can reach Hwy 20 by taking Hwy 267 from where I was driving on Woodville Hwy.  Is it possible something fell in the stretch of woods on hwy 267?  My husband made an inquiry to the Wakulla Sheriff's department, however nothing had been reported.  I am a very skeptical and would like to know if anyone else see something falling from the sky that night.  None of us that witnessed this object heardany sounds.  Can anyone explain?;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
Sighting in Tallahassee;2002-12-02 22:00:00;2+ Hours;Sighting in Tallahassee My son and I got stuck in a median while traveling through Tallahassee.  I was bored so I was stargazing and noticed a star and it looked strange along the bottom.  It was pretty far away but the light it was giving off looked like a beard along the bottom.  I asked my son to look at the star and tell me what he saw and he said, It's moving.  I thought he was just playing or seeing things but when I took a closer look, it was in fact moving.  It would go rapidly to the left, then the right, and sometimes up and down.  Then it started fluttering in small circles like a butterfly.  I said to my son, who was amazed at what he was seeing, I wonder if this is the only one.  As I started focusing on what looked like stars, I noticed that they were moving too.  I counted more than 20 of them all around.  The closest ones were in the eastern sky and they would get really close and bright and then pull back and fade away and disappear completely, only to reappear a few seconds later.  Some gentleman stopped to try and help us and I asked them if they saw the light moving and they did, but I don't know who they were.  I snapped a picture of it with my camera.  It had black and white film and I'm not sure how it turned out.  When I develop the film, I will mail it in if it turns out. ((NUFORC Note:  We note that the sighting may have been the result of looking at celestial bodies, possibly twinkling stars.  PD));30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
Flashes of light outside across our canal that appeared every 30 seconds for several minutes.;2004-06-01 01:00:00;3 minutes;Flashes of light outside across our canal that appeared every 30 seconds for several minutes. I noticed the light outside my bedroom window coming from the other side of our canal. I noticed a flash of light and waited a few second to see if it appeared again. Exactly 30 seconds later it appeared again. It stayed on this schedule for several minutes until it finally stopped. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

I have seen this two times now.;2007-03-29 23:30:00;half hour+;I have seen this two times now. There was more then one time seeing something. One week ago myself and my father witnessed two white light that also had some red and blueish-green blinking lights at the top and bottom of the white lights. They where there for about an hour. The next night they where not there. I did not think of them again. Then tonight I was out side smoking and saw another white light with the same red and blueish-green lights. The only difference is that it is moving from place to place. The light was still there when i came in to send this message.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
Very Bright Light In the Sky Making Unusual Movements;2007-07-16 04:12:00;15 seconds;Very Bright Light In the Sky Making Unusual Movements On the morning of July 16, 2007, at approximately 4:15 a.m. my husband stepped outside of our apartment to smoke a cigarette.  He spotted a large, luminous, bright moving object.  It zoomed in one direction and then immediately made a u-turn back towards where it came from, however, it zoomed in a more southward direction.  He frantically called me from my slumber and I stepped out on the balcony and witnessed a very bright light that zoomed to the left.  We did not hear the object make a single noise.  This phenomenon took place for approximately 10-15 seconds.  Although we could not estimate the altitude, it did not seem to be flying very high.  In fact, our view of the object was blocked because of the numerous trees that surround our area.  Although it is more difficult to estimate distance and size at night, the object could not have been far away because the light was very bright and noticeable.  According to my husband, the light mimicked the movement made by a ping-pong ball.  At one point, the light became brighter and after that we lost sight of it. In my opinion, neither a plane nor a helicopter would have been so silent had they been so close. I do not believe that a plane is capable of making such movements.

Hello,I live in Northern Florida,and last night @ 6:30 pm,I was looking up for meteor activity and saw a what looked like part of a comet. It was slow moving out of the North West. It almost looked like a gaseous glowing cloud. There were no clouds early that evening on 12-10-07. Do you know anything about this?  Thanks,D ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.

Stationary star-like like directly overhead  at least 50,000 ft , photos reveal round shadow  object and contrail;2015-05-20 08:00:00;30 minutes;stationary star-like like directly overhead  at least 50,000 ft , photos reveal round shadow  object and contrail I was outside having a cup of coffee enjoying the morning sun before going to work.  I was doing some stretching and yoga and laid back and looked up at the clear blue sky.  A star like object caught my eye.  At first I thought it was a jet at very high altitude with the sun's light was reflecting off of it.  However, it was not moving.  It was stationary at very high altitude.  Not flickering, not flashing. no changing color.  Just a star like object stationary for at least 30 min.  During this time I called Tallahasse airport and asked to speak to the tower. After being shuffled around and having to tell my story severaL times, I spoke to the tower and they did not have anything on radar.  I also took approximately 10 photos with my smartphone.   I could not tell if I had got the object in the photos but I did notice while taking them that a contrail was present in my camera screen, but not visible to my naked eye.  I then went in to work, and looked at the photos and saw the pictures did capture the contrail, and a couple did have the star object but only visble on greater magnification, although somewhat fuzzy.  Most interesting are the round shadow like objects captured in the photos but not visible to my naked eye.  I also captured a jet in one photo and it does give one a bit of a perspective.  Could it have been Venus, Jupiter, or Saturn visible at 8:30 am on a bright sunny morning?  I dont know.  I think it was really a object at very high altitute maybe 50-100,000 ft.  There were a couple of jets that went by during the event and this object was higher.  The contrail and round grey shadow objects appear to be at different altitudes.  I dont think they are ghost images or reflections off of something.  I took several photos with them in the photos and they are  in the same location (using the playfort fabric roof as a reference point).  I am sure I moved around and took each photo from a slightly different location, yet the objects appear in the same location in the sky.  Maybe you guys have someone that can analyze the photos.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
Strange orange light seen in the night sky west of Tallahassee, FL;2015-05-23 22:40:00;3 minutes;Strange orange light seen in the night sky west of Tallahassee, FL My girlfriend and I were sitting on the front porch of our home located on the western side of Tallahassee, FL.  I was on my phone, looking up something on the internet, when she asks me, “What’s that?”  I turn around to see an orange light in the sky.  From where I was sitting it was moving right to left, seemingly in the direction of Panama City.  At first, I didn’t think it was out of the ordinary.  But then we saw lights dropping from object.  I pulled up the camera on my phone and zoomed in while my girlfriend ran inside to get a roommate to come see.  I tapped the video button on my phone to switch from camera to video recorder and I assumed it was recording but unfortunately you have to hit the red circle and I was too focused in on the object to notice that it didn’t record.  While zoomed in, the object appeared to be oblong in shape, but it was hard to tell as the resolution wasn’t that great. The part that really intrigued me was the lights that fell from the object.  It reminded me of molten metal, dripping from the object.  The lights were exactly the same color as the object, as seemed to burn out shortly after separating from the object. After watching the object for 2 or 3 minutes, it started to dim, and dim some more until it was gone.  It disappeared before it should have left my line of sight.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
2 nights of bright as the moon object and 5 aircraft in night sky after seeing it.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus & Jupiter.  PD));2015-06-30 21:45:00;2 days;2 nights of bright as the moon object and 5 aircraft in night sky after seeing it. On the night of June 29, 2015, I saw a very bright light next to a western star.  This light did not appear to move.  I was driving and turned away from it heading to a local pub.  The bouncer said he saw the same thing in he western sky at 21:45.  I saw it at 22:00.   Tonight on June 30, 2015, I was driving again and saw the same light.  Except this time I was able to watch it for a good 15 minutes while I was stopped and at traffic lights.  This light was still next to a small star in the sky but the this time I saw this light fade in and out.  When the light went out it was just a faint gray dot in the sky.  The light would come back on gradually to get brighter and brighter.   I made it to my destination and told everybody what I had just seen for the last two nights.  They (my family) wanted to go outside to see it.  The only thing we got to see is a bunch of aircrafts flying in formation.  Three in formation 1 flying off in opposite direction with fast blinking lights at odd speeds.  And one very normal plane going to the airport off from the others.  For a total of 5 planes at the same time around the time of 22:10. ((NUFORC Note:  We strongly suspect that the two bright objects in the northwestern sky were Venus and Jupiter.

Two pulsing lights traveling along the same flight path at twilight;2019-12-09 18:00:00;5 minutes;Two pulsing lights traveling along the same flight path at twilight In Tallahassee, Florida downtown office building. Looking from my north facing office window at twilight, saw two pulsing lights at a distance too far apart to be a single aircraft. Just above the western horizon, one behind the other. They were each marked by single pulses of white, star like light, apparent magnitude 3.0, the trailing one pulsing about 3/10ths second after the lead one, traveling along the same northeast to southwest path. Each light pulsed at a rate approximately once per second. Called my colleague into my office, and she observed the same lights, verified that they were too far apart to belong to a single aircraft, and appeared as flickering stars in motion along a flight path rather than aircraft. Neither of the lights had any color, and the second, trailing light, always pulsed immediately after the lead light.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025

I stopped and looked up to the sky for some reason when I unlocked my vehicle door. I saw what I believed to be a satellite moving slowly across the sky. It was simply just a dot of light far away. Then the object moved quickly downward and I knew it wasn’t a satellite. I gazed in awe as another bright light quickly moved towards it. They were moving very unnaturally. I stared for about one minute before the tree line obstructed my view.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
