Faint light zips back and fourth across sky;1983-05-17 05:45:00;10 minutes;Faint light zips back and fourth across sky While standing outside with my dog, I noticed a light in the sky which looked to be moving quite quickly due to it's apparent FAR distance. The light was very faint and at first glance seemed to be a satellite, just a pin-prick gliding in a southerly direction away from me... as I watched it, it's brightness seemed to fade and then suddenly started jerking around in the sky- It seemed to be VERY far away, as I said earlier,(Like a sattelite in orbit) and was making 90 degree turns and sudden stops... it was very impressive as well as the 10 minute duration of the display. This continued untill a SECOND light came across the sky towards it, though this time it was most definetly an airplane of some sort with trademark blinking lights and flying in an even and steady path... as the blinking light of the air-plane approached the jerky UFO light, it instantly darted downward and over the horizon, while the air-plane continued on a straight easterly path. I observed this looking south/south-east from the north of Tallahassee, Florida.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025

I was walking my two dogs around the block.  I saw a bright light.  I thought, after a few minutes, it was a plane because it slowly got closer and brighter.  Then my dogs tried to lay flat on the ground and I found myself trying to hide under trees and bushes.  I don't know why.  This thing I thought was a plane was now gliding right over the top of us.  It was clear, like water, and silent.  Like a big blob, undescribable.  No lights, but you could tell there was a perimeter to this thing, but it was like looking at water.  It was moving very slowly and skimmed over the top of the trees and went on its way.  I don't know how long the whole incident lasted, but I can tell you that from the minute I first saw that light I was almost in a trance.  I couldn't take my eyes off of it.  I ran home after it had passed, called the radio and tv stations and police but nobody else reported seeing anything.  I was probably about 21 at the time.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025

As I was walking, I looked into the sky I saw something that was flashing lights or reflecting light from the sunrise. I noticed that the object was bouncing and changing directions very fast so I took few pics before the object disappeared.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
