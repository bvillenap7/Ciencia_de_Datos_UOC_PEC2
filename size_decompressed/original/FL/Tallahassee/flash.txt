There was a light outside my window but it was like a silent firecracker falling at it, the rooster down the street was going crazy and I heard a bunch of dogs barking in the distance. It was like a falling fire star. Not very bright, but enough to see from my bed- through the thin curtains. It kinda faded as it was coming closer and made a small noise as it seemed to (I think) hit the space between my window and the ground. I tried to stay up as long as I could but I fell asleep somehow. I had a strange dream, well maybe it was more like a vision of being abducted- I remember it very vaguely.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
