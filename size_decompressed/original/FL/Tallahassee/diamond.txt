I did not witness the event of maybe 10 minutes but I do have access to the video made. If you are a reliable reporting agency that can be verified I can put you in touch with the person that has the original 8mm video and witnessed the event. They are concerned about releasing info to military organization. I do not give out my address or phone to anyone. You can contact me via e-mail. This is a pretty good quality video for taken by amateur at night. Definitely worth seeing. It appears to have landed. Area behind this subdivision is isolated with a lake and no development.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
