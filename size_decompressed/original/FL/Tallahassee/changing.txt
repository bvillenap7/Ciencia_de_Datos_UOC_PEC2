White and red lights cylinder and round shaped spotted several nights in sky.  ((anonymous report));2016-05-16 00:00:00;weeks;White and red lights cylinder and round shaped spotted several nights in sky. On approximately May 1, 2016, was getting ready for bed and was in my kitchen and looked out the back window.  My back yard has a chain link fence with a wooded area behind it.  Noticed lights in the wooded area – first though they were lightning bugs but realized that they are not reddish white round globes that zip around.  They starting coming into my yard (about 8 of them) and were zooming from one side of the yard to the other, bouncing into my neighbor’s yard and then across mine again.  I could not believe what I was seeing and just continued to stare out the window.  One of the “things” starting coming straight toward my kitchen window.  It is like it noticed me standing there and came to a stop about 3 feet from the window and took off.  All the other objects left also.  Haven’t seen anything out back again.  However, on May 16 I started noticing lights in the sky in front of my house, across the road, etc.  They are bright white and sometimes reddish.  They ! flicker and change shape.  There are sometimes 4 or 5 and sometimes only 2 or 3, but there almost every night.   Last night, June 7, at about 11 p.m. there about 6 of them in the sky.  One of them zoomed down near the street lamp at the corner of my property and the light immediately went off.  I went to my living room and flipped on my porch lights and the street light immediately came back on, no flickers or anything.   About 4 or 5 of the objects seem to zoom off to the north and there were about 3 of the objects left in the sky.  These make no sound whatsoever, but are freaking me out.  I do not go outside after dark, have put thick curtains over all my windows and leave a lamp on.  I just want them to go away.

3 bright white objects changed direction and shape formation, then merged into 1 oblong object;2020-12-28 14:45:00;5 min+;3 bright white objects changed direction and shape formation, then merged into 1 oblong object On 12/28/2020 at 2:45 pm, it was a bright and sunny day with no clouds in the sky.  I was walking outside in my neighborhood that has a lot of pine trees, and when I came to an incline with a clearing of trees that exposed the sky,  I looked up and noticed 3 distinct bright white round objects arranged in a straight line moving west.  As I continued walking, I noticed that the 3 objects began to move around each other as you would move shells in a shell game. They slowed down, almost stopping, then formed a perfect triangle. This is when I tried to take a video, which I got for a second or so until a tree branch obscured my view.  As I moved to an opening to keep watching, the 3 triangular objects merged into 1 oblong object that was now moving in the opposite direction (east). The object kept moving eastward as one oblong object. There was a passenger airplane in the vicinity, that was distinctly and obviously an airplane, unlike these 3 objects that moved, sl! owed, changed shape and direction. I watched the object(s) for about 5 minutes, then kept walking, while they were still present.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
