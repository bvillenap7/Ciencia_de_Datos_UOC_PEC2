Multiple roundish or teardrop shape orbs seen during the daytime.;2014-01-15 12:00:00;5-10 minutes;Multiple roundish or teardrop shape orbs seen during the daytime. I stopped at a convenient store during my lunch hour today and looked up at the sky because I heard a helicopter.  While I was watching the helicopter, the sky was clear and blue but I noticed that there was a bright whitish light it looked like an orb with a beam of light or tail coming down from it and when it moved it had a silver metallic shine to it but it didn't seem to be moving like a normal object.   I looked at it for a moment and thought that is cool someone released a balloon maybe?  But as I was thinking this a dozen or maybe more white orbs started to appear-they were dimmer than the first one I spotted but were just appearing like a light switch was turning them on one by one.    When I saw this all thoughts of balloons left my head.  I watched these things switch on for about 5-10 minutes.   I got scared and did not see anyone in the parking lot to talk to about what it was so I quickly went inside to make my purchase and clear my head.  I thought when I went back out I could decipher what I was seeing more clearly.   I spent about a minute inside and when I came back out they had all just disappeared.   My hands were shaking when I got into my car and I quickly tried to google any type of celebration or memorial where balloons were being released but I could not find anything significant happening in our area today.   The helicopter that was flying by at the time was white with either a black or dark blue bottom like a police helicopter.  I did not see any name on the side of it.  Could it have been dropping something.   I'm just curious if anyone else saw this and new what it was.   I am having a hard to determining whether I should submit this but.......I would like to know what it was or if anyone else seen it.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
