Multiple orange glowing lights over Tallahassee, FL;2011-02-18 20:45:00;15-30 Minutes;Multiple orange glowing lights over Tallahassee, FL It was around 8:45 when my and my friend walked out of Fuzions Frozen Yogurt on Kerry Forest Parkway in Tallahassee, FL.  The objects were coming from the Southwest area.  They were orange and circular, and they were just a little bit bigger than the stars in the sky.   They were also brighter than the stars.  I immediately took out my phone and started recording it.  There was about 10 of us standing in the parking lot watching them.   A police officer was standing on the sidewalk next to us but when we tried to ask her what the lights were she just ignored us, got in her car, and started talking on her radio while looking at them.   They first appeared on the treeline in a tight group, then they started spreading out and moving in different directions.  They were all going the same speed and the same relative direction, but they were probably at different altitudes because they were spreading out and moving apart.  Some were brighter than others.   I didn't ! stay to see the whole thing, but on the way home there were a lot of cops on my road.  There were probably about six or seven cars, with about 10-20 people standing around watching them search.  It seemed like they were looking around in the woods but I was trying to pay attention to the road, so I didn't see much.   I am 16 years old and I attend Chiles High School.  I wouldn't have contacted your organization unless I was very concerned, and I'm not trying to waste your time.  I'm an honor student with a ((deleted--very high)) GPA and I'm taking a ((art/film) class.   The video I took was low quality because it was on my phone, but you can cleary see the lights in the sky.   The crowd at the frozen yogurt store was made up of two moms with their children, a few old women, and a police officer, along with the other customers in the store.  My friend refused to write a report because he wasn't paying attention and thought that I was just being paranoid.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
Bright light in the sky in Tallahassee;2011-02-18 21:00:00;5 minutes;Bright light in the sky in Tallahassee    I play in a band that was in the same parking lot as fuzions off Kerry Forest in Tallahassee Florida where lights in the sky were reported the night of 02-18-11.  While playing I noticed the crowdâ€™s attention was not on us but the sky.  When I looked to see what it was that had captured the audiences attention from the awesome music I saw only one of the lights.  At first I thought it to be a helicopter using a bright light because of the slow hover like flight patterns that were not 100% straight. I watched this light for the entire song I was playing which was about 4 minutes long.  Having only planes and stars as a reference I could guess the altitude of the light to be less than cruising altitude but much higher than landing plane traffic. (My guess 20,000 ft or more)  This light looked as if was burning white and orange yet it was bigger and much brighter than any stars.  The light also had no visible contrail of light like a meteor or flashing starboard or p! ort lights.   If this light was as high as I think the size of this object must have been big, and the way the light was distorted yet still bright further backed my altitude guess.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
It was a cicle like craft hovering in the sky  it was clear white looking it had no lights on it moving at about 1mph;2016-10-01 15:30:00;10 seconds;It was a cicle like craft hovering in the sky  it was clear white looking it had no lights on it moving at about 1mph Sorry im just reporting this 4 months later it's just so shocking im a bug fan of ufo so I know what we saw was legit no doubt about it. So me and my girl friend was riding down Tennessee street I think north or south one of the two and I was like baby look at that over there she looked her mouth just dropped. Im not sure if anyone else saw it because we wasn't the only ones on the road but we saw a circle like craft just hovering in mid air it looked clear or white something like that almost if it was about to land on the tower tree looking thingy which is impossible to do, it was moving at about 1mph yesss that slow. Next thing you know we pass by a small tree that literally a small tree we passed by it in light seconds because realize we are in a car it doesn't take that long to pass a tree. we looked back up to see it again.it was gone just that fast . I even turned my car around in mid traffic to try to locate what we just seen we never saw it again. I ! will tell anybody what I saw. WE KNOW WHAT WE SAW WASN'T A NORMAL SPACE CRAFT. I WAS SO SMALL IT WOULD BE INPOSSIBLE FOR A HUMAN TO FIT IN. WELL THAT'S WHAT IT SEEM LIKE;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
Ring of lights.;2018-07-12 05:10:00;60 minutes;I was on my balcony at around 5 am this morning.  In the sky, I noticed a gold ring of lights that did not move.  The lights did not blink at all and got dimmer and brighter on occasion.   An airplane passed by after a bit and appeared much smaller than this ring.  It stayed in the sky, not moving, for over an hour and as the sun rose, it still was there, but as it got brighter, I could not see it again.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
