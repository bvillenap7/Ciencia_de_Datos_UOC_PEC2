Aircraft with lights spotted over I-10 exit on Capital Circle NW in Tallahassee.;2001-11-27 23:00:00;1 minute;Aircraft with lights spotted over I-10 exit on Capital Circle NW in Tallahassee. We were on our way home from the store tonight when we saw something that looked like a plane.  It had a row of lights on the front similar to that of an airplane, but as we got closer we realized it was not moving.  When we got closer we saw that it was not attached to anything and was hovering, about a hundred yards up.  It was dark so we couldn't see the shape, but from behind I could see three large orangish colored lights in the shape of a triangle in the back.  By the time we turned around to go back, not more than 20 seconds, it was gone.  It was fairly open in the area so if it was anywhere near where we saw it it would have been visible.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
rocket shaped, flat bottom, changing from vertical to horizontal, speed increasing suddenly seen floating around;2003-09-09 22:15:00;15 minutes;rocket shaped, flat bottom, changing from vertical to horizontal, speed increasing suddenly seen floating around Observed by 2 graduate students from National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The object had a rocket shape with a flat bottom, was flying extremely slowly, at an angle changing from 0 to almost 45. almost motionless and floating in the air at very low height, almost 40-50 ft above the tree tops. A blue light flashing in the bottom of the object and 2 red lights flashing on 2 sides. The object made a low rumbling sound like an aircraft's engine. It suddenly went vertical and then as we followed it and parked our cars, it became horizontal and increased the speed all of a sudden and vanished quickly. Again seen near our home, floating around 30-40 ft above tree tops and then vanishing quickly.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
Red orb pulsated moving across sky silently, slow motion blink/dim/reappeared in line and continued on.;2015-11-22 22:30:00;3 minutes;Red orb pulsated moving across sky silently, slowmotion blink/dim/reappeared in line and continued on. Stepped outside of restaurant located near center of city upon crest of large hill while Fast moving clouds reflecting orange light.  Lit a cigarette while watching a helicopter leave the area of the hospital traveling south until sound of craft ended.   A short time later, maybe 3 minutes (finishing cigarette,last two inhales) orb appeared in the far east with back drop of orange glow from city lights contrasting a pulsating red orb, moving across sky at approx 1500 feet above the deck with cloud ceiling approximately 500 feet beyond.   Kept expecting to see white light from helicopter thinking it had swung around and returned but there was no light coming from this object.  It was not making a sound.  Clouds were moving west to east...orb moved east to west. It was NOT any kind of man made craft I had ever seen or witnessed before and changed in shape and dynamic...it was not a true sphere, shapes formed in the absence of surface as it seemed to pulsate only once! in my presence but continued on...the size of it was about that of a compact car but taller in terms of height, and seemed to be of a deliberate intention.  No plane could move this way.  More like a helicopter but what made the hairs on my neck stand up was that the sound I had just experienced never returned like I expected it to and when it was closest to my location I realized this was like no other object I had ever seen in my entire life...it just happened to be in the sky when I looked up.  I could not account for 2 hours of my time between clocking out from work and the 10 minute walk to my apartment.  My phone was at 100% charge when I left work, having been on the charger all night, was completely dead when I tried to take pictures.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
Around April 21, 2019 at 13:00 pm had a close encounter with a human form object dressed in black from head to toe.;2019-04-21 13:00:00;1-2 Minutes;Around April 21, 2019 at 13:00 pm had a close encounter with a human form object dressed in black from head to toe. I saw a strange black human shaped object staring at me while I was in the garage of my friend's house.  I had my back turned facing the inside of the garage, and when I turn around now facing the outside of the garage, the black thing appeared to be staring at me however, I could not see it eyes.  It was black from head to toe.  It appeared to be standing at a profile position near what looked like a low bush. No eyes or facial feature noted- too black.  When I attempted to call my friend who had entered his house, I found my voice speechless. Then, it disappeared into thin air!  I drew a picture of what I saw and would like to share it with an investigator.  We are NOT along in this universe.  Of notable mention: The strange object did not appear hostile toward me during the brief encounter. Please know that this is a NOT a HOAX sighting.  This occurred in April 2019, and after recent news of aircraft pilots reporting strange sightings, I felt compelled t! o contact this department to share my experience.  I had a close encounter with the black object, but no spaceship or strange aircraft was seen.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
