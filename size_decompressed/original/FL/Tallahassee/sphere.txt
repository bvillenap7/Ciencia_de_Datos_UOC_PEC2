small spheres flying in formation near approach to Tallahassee airport;1989-11-24 12:00:00;5-10 seconds;small spheres flying in formation near approach to Tallahassee airport The event occurred on the Friday after Thanksgiving 1989 at around 12 noon.  My wife, brother in law, and myself were playing golf at the city course on the south side of Tallahassee, Jake Gaither Golf course.  We teed off in late morning, and were on the 5th hole, a par 3,  around noontime.  Weather was perfect, clear blue sky.   While waiting to tee off, I noticed a USAIR turboprop flying south along the east edge of the golf course at maybe 1500 ft. altitude.  The plane was approx.  a mile away. It was heading towards Tallahassee regional airport.   I noticed that it was starting to make a right hand turn for final approach and it was going to collide with a flock of birds that was also flying south.  I watched for a few seconds and as my eyes changed focus from the plane to the birds  I then realized that the flock of birds was not a flock of birds but rather several small grey spheres flying in formation heading south but at a slightly higher altitude than the! plane, or maybe a little farther east of the plane.  The plane made its turn and the spheres continued south.  I yelled to my wife and brother in law to look but they could not locate them before they passed behind the trees.  The entire event lasted about 5-10 seconds.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
flash of light, great speed, rounded turn/change of course, abrupt full stop;2003-10-29 06:15:00;30 seconds;flash of light, great speed, rounded turn/change of course, abrupt full stop Went out to get newspaper.  Looked up to the south and noticed several stars low in sky.  Saw a flash of light and then saw movement.  Movement was slow at first then picked up speed moving away from stars and toward southeast horizon.  I thought it was a shooting star at that point. Then it abruptly changed course to northerly not a corner turn, more like a rounded turn and still at high speed then it abruptly stopped.  It was a great distance out from earth as it appeared more like a star moving than any detailed lights or objects.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
Sphere, Shiny, disapear;2005-01-31 07:30:00;1-2 mins;Sphere, Shiny, disapear This was at around, 7:30am  I noticed a jet way up in the sky when I pulled off (the vapor trail from it caught my eye, o and there wasn't a cloud in the sky, just as clear as it could be) So I was like, Hey, there's a jet then I looked about 10:30 to 11 o'clock above the jet, probably about... (not good at guessing how far away it was from the jet, but from my prespective it was 5-6 inches, which i guess would be 1,000 feet maybe ??? ) anyways it was round, a perfect sphere, silver, and very shiney. The reason it caught my eye was because it was leaving no vapor trail at all, and it wasn't moving, well it was moving, but like perfectly with the jet, except it would move side to side a little. then all of a sudden it disapeared.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
Low flying orb-like lights (approximately 7 ) move slowly and silently across sky from east to west.;2008-04-30 23:00:00;1 minute;Low flying orb-like lights (approximately 7 ) move slowly and silently across sky from east to west. While looking at the stars towards the north from my backyard at around 11 pm, I had a strange feeling that I was going to see something.  About 5-10 seconds later, 7 white orb-like lights came sweeping across the sky from the east.  The lights did not seem to be in any sort of formation, but were grouped closely toghether.  At first I thought the lights were all part of one craft, but I'm almost positive that a couple of the lights moved independently of each other.  The lights moved in a westerly direction above Tallahassee Memorial Hospital, but were not helicopters.  The lights made absolutely no sound and had no other visible navigational lights.  I called loudly to my wife to come outside, but she was in the shower and did not hear me.  The lights disappeared from my view is less than a minutes after being obscured by the tree line.

Tallahassee Sighting;2010-04-26 00:00:00;30 Min;Tallahassee Sighting I went out to smoke a cigarette when I saw 2 lights moving in the sky to the southeast of Tallahassee. I paid more attention when I saw them fly horizontally and go vertical, one chasing the other.  They were moving so fast I thought they were spot lights or my imagination.  I went back in my work and came back out 15 min later for another smoke and to leave when I looked over and the 2 lights were still chasing each other but where a lot closer.  I stood there and I saw 2 bright spheres flying at really high speeds all over the sky.  This continued for another 15 min when they started to slow down.   I wasn’t going to report this until I saw 5 more spheres appear, like they where there the whole time but didn’t have lights on.  Six formed a V formation and one was to the north of the V but behind the leader of the V.  They flew off at extremely high speeds to the northeast until I couldn’t see them anymore.  The date and time of the sighting was 04/26/10 at 23:45 to 04/27/10 at 0:15.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
2 lights moving south spin around each other and then vanish.;2011-09-25 02:15:00;3 minutes;2 lights moving south spin around each other and then vanish Me and some friends were sitting on the porch off Betton road looking west.  We saw two bright bluish lights moving south (the airport is south so we didn't think much of it, at first) the lights then started to slow down until one was just above the other.   They then started spinning around each other extremely fast making a solid blue ring in the sky until one shot off into the distance (away from earth from the look of it) the other light stayed around for a bit moving upward into the sky more before dimming out.    No idea what it was but it scared the heck out of us for a minute. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
I saw two green orbs floating next to each other, metal prongs jut out from these orbs and these orbs spin and jut into the sky.;2012-07-05 00:55:00;5 seconds;I saw two green orbs floating next to each other, metal prongs jut out from these orbs and these orbs spin and jut into the sky. On July 5th, 2012 at 12:55AM I was driving by myself West (towards town) on a county road in Tallahassee, FL and had just driven down a large hill and was approaching a second smaller hill. About 300 feet in front of me I saw two hazy mint green orbs floating, about eight feet above the ground. They were each a little larger than a grapefruit (possibly bigger), almost sparkled (maybe that signifies lights) and had about three feet of space between them.  The three feet of space acted as an imaginary horizontal line across the middle of the road even though the orbs seemed to be independent of each other. In an instant, metal prongs, thin in nature and almost rectangular shaped, jutted out around the diameter (middle) of each orb (left/right, not up/down).  Then, each orb spun (left/right) independently in their places and shot up into the sky, leaving an almost glow where they had just been hovering.  This happened so quickly that they were out of sight completely by the time I drove through the place where they had been.  From the time I saw them to the time they shot into the sky, it was only a five second time span. It all felt very advanced, direct and incredibly fast.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
Floating flame, constant speed and direction (Chinese lantern);2013-08-26 21:00:00;2 minutes;Floating flame, constant speed and direction (Chinese lantern) Driving due east on Buck Lake Rd., just past Davis Drive, in Tallahassee,  August 26, 2013, approx. 9 pm.  Noticed what initially looked like a meteor up and to my left a bit, to the NE of me, while driving.  Immediately knew it wasn't a meteor, due to its slow speed.   It was a fireball, sphere-shaped and maybe 25 feet in diameter, that was flickering, but in a sphere shape, not the normal upside-down tear shape a candle flame would have.  It kept a constant speed (~90 mph), elevation (~1250 feet), and direction (~SSW) during the approximately two minutes I observed it.   I initially kept driving, before realizing I should pull over and record video on my phone.  Unfortunately I waited too long to get anything close to good evidence, but I did manage to capture a few pixels and seconds worth of it.  If I had to chart the thing's course on a map, it would be a straight line starting north of Buck Lake Rd, south of US Hwy 90, and a little east of Pedrick Rd.  It would end somewhere around the intersection of Apalachee Parkway and Capital Circle SW.  All of this in or near the city limits of Tallahassee.   Video can be viewed here (the brighter lights are from a random house, at the corner of Buck Lake Rd and Dove Rd, I believe):   http://1drv.ms/1SLgpUy;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
