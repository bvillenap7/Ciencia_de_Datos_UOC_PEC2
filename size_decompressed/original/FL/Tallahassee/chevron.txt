1988 Tallahassee, FLA  V-shape object with white lights!;1987-08-20 21:00:00;15/sec;1988 Tallahassee, FLA  V-shape object with white lights! I was surfing the net when I came across a photo of the Lubbock case in Texas. My pulse rate shot up and my jaw dropped. This was almost identical of what I saw at night in Aug of 1988. I was outside taking out the trash, when I noticed this large object overhead with all white lights shinning down coasting along at a slow speed.  I could barely make out the shape, but the lights were shinning down in a V shape, just like the Lubbock UFO!!!! This was a very large object! Much bigger than an airliner. It was about several hundred feet in the air, and made not a single sound. I was only about to see it for a couple of seconds, because I was out on my front lawn next to the Apartment, and a line of trees next to a hill.  I remember all the lights I would say it had the same amount as the Lubbock. I can tell you it had more larger lights than smaller ones.  They were not blinding lights, but they were highly visible looking straight up! I always have been a big Aircraft fan (that’s one of the reasons I am in the Air force). I can promise you this was no aircraft! With all my current knowledge of AF aircraft I never herd of any such type of aircraft then or now! When it got to the tree line all the lights went out of site and it was gone.  The direction of this object was heading from north to south. I’m sure my parents, and my sister never did believe me the 7th grader. I hope this report helps. I hope you can help me shed some light on this, Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Bullet and V Shaped UFOs seen over Tallahassee;2010-03-19 17:45:00;10 mina;Bullet and V Shaped UFOs seen over Tallahassee On March 19th at about 5:45 pm we were merging on to I-10, Intersection 203, Capital Circle NW, Tallahassee.  As we were making the final merge onto the interstate I noticed a bright glow on the underside of one of the few white clouds that were in the sky.  As I looked harder I noticed a dark line pointing up towards it at about a 45 degree angle. I kept my eye on it until it disappeared behind trees, due to the bends in the I-10.  About 7-10 minutes later we were approaching Intersection 196, Capital Circle NE, when we finally got a good look at what we’d seen from a distance. There were two objects.  The first was a small, highly reflective, bullet shaped object with no wings or tail.  The second was rather more startling.  Keeping pace behind the bullet shaped object was ‘V’ shaped object that was quite simply the biggest think  I've ever seen in the sky.  Although a good distance away it was easily the size of a football stadium, possibly larger.  The object was dark gray/brown in color. My wife was quite shaken up by this.  I was excited!  She slammed on the breaks pretty hard on the off ramp when she saw this thing and noticed other people around her doing the same thing, looking up at the sky. Anyone passing Intersection 196, heading west, MUST have got an even better view of it.  And it says something as to how slow it was moving if we managed to catch up with it.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
