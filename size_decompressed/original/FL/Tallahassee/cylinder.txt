It then started to head south towards me when i bright spotlight comeing from the object the light grew larger and larger when it suddenly changed directions and started heading north at a high rate of speed till it disapeared.  it was the speed that it was coming towards me and the speed of its departure that really changed my opinion of it being a airplane.  i called my dad and as i was talking to him i saw it in the tree line heading east to west and it was close agaain.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025

Me and my friend was outside on the back of my car.  We heard something sounded like a helicopter, but it seem liked forever to get to us.   About 2 minutes later we seen what appeared a flying cylinder with blinking color light going around it.  At first we thought it was coming for us because we were the only two people outside at the time.   Then it changed into a 3 light object thing.  Flew away then disappeared in thin air behind the trees..  I also had a video of the object on my phone.   At first people at work and friends didn't believe me.  I showed almost all my friends the video an a few co-works before a few month later I broke my phone and had to get anew one.;30.470996835443;-84.253256962025
