It had a glowing white light towards the top right of it wwhich seemed to glow, not flash, like a consistant plane nav light.   I was driving south in flagler bch.  It was getting dark.  I saw it out of the top of my windhield and pulled over, got out, and watched in amazement of the erratic pattern it was making.  It vibrated and moved in a counter clockwise direction, stood still, then dropped due south, then moved due north into its original position.   darted west shortly and then took off south and dis appeared. the closest shape discription you had was the chevron.  I think I explained the shape well in my discription. 35 yrs of watching the sky I have never seen anything like this.   707-((number deleted)).  ((name deleted));29.4732;-81.1319
