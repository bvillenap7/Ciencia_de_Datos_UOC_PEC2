A string of lights appeared and slowly faded, but not in sequential order of appearance.  When first seen they appeared in a line leading toward the Atlantic shore.  They seemed to come from an aircraft.  A sound similar to a jet aircraft was briefly heard, but not throughout the event.  Lights appeared in a line approaching the coast, but none seen deployed over land.  I have I-phone video.  Lat  29°30'22.94 N Long  81° 7'8.17 W approximate location.;29.4732;-81.1319
