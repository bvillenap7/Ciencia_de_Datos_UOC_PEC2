That question remained unanswered Wednesday morning, and investigators have called off a search for a possible plane crash. Dispatchers started getting calls Tuesday night reporting a fireball falling out of the sky and into the ocean off Flagler Beach, near State Roads A1A and 100. Witnesses said they thought it might be a plane that crashed about 7 miles offshore. Flagler County deputies then called the Volusia County Sheriff's Office, asking if they could use that agency's helicopter, AirOne, to help in the search. The helicopter was sent up, but officials quickly realized that the search area would be too far out over the open water to safely operate the aircraft. So AirOne had to turn around and head back to shore. Deputies then notified the Coast Guard, which sent a boat from Station Ponce Inlet to begin searching. But officials called off the search late Wednesday morning. Petty Officer Jessica Potter said the Coast Guard found no wreckage or any other sign that a plane went down. She also said there were no reports of missing or overdue aircraft in the area. While officials said it probably wasn't a plane, one witness, Nick Kennerly, told us he saw the light and saw where it came from. Kennerly said a couple staying at a nearby motel lit a Chinese lantern. It's much like a hot air balloon. He said the lantern it simply caught fire and fell into the ocean. No one from the Coast Guard was immediately available to comment on that possibility. Check back and refresh this article for the latest on this breaking news story.;29.4732;-81.1319
