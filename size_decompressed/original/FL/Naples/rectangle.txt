Square craft right over our car about tree top height from us!!;2008-05-09 21:35:00;15 seconds;Square craft right over our car about tree top height from us!! We were on I 75 about half an hour away from Naples Florida.  In a stretch of the high way were there are no exits and no lights on a clear night.  As we are driving and stargazing I noticed a bright light about 30 to 40 in-front of us.  So we are driving towards the craft.  The craft came right over the car and about tree top hight form the car.  I got the best view when it was right above us but more to the drivers side of the car.  Thats when I noticed the craft was square in shape and had four lights one on each conner of the craft.  It was really close to us and it had no sound it kept moving past us.  I was with my girlfriend and I was very curious but she was very scared thats how close it was.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542

Very large rectangular grid of lights. At about 1000' and moving silently;2011-03-25 23:00:00;20 seconds;Very large rectangular grid of lights. At about 1000' and moving silently 3/25/11    UFO Friday night 3/25/11 at around 11:00 pm.  I was traveling westbound in a top down convertible at 75 MPH on Alligator Alley, (I-75)  At around MM 51.  There are no lights on this road.  The highway is divided by a very wide grass median.  Ahead of me, over the median came a very large square and very flat grid of lights.  The grid was almost as wide as the median about a 100’ +or- and twice as long, like a football field.   There were bright white marker light’s at evenly spaced intervals and lessor light’s making up a grid pattern within the square perimeter.  I was moving at 75 and it appeared to be moving at about 100 +/-, eastbound, not faster.  Altitude was about 1000’.  It was silent.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
Bright, color-alternating craft appearing and and disappearing over the ocean;2012-09-24 23:30:00;2 minutes;Bright, color-alternating craft appearing and and disappearing over the ocean At approximately 11:30pm, a strange light appeared over the ocean and become very bright within a matter of seconds.  Two alternating lights appeared side by side and began to change colors (red, yellow, green, and white).   A woman walked by and asked my friend and I if we were seeing it and remarked that she had seen it there almost every other night and it was especially peculiar tonight.  She also made out and elongated shape of the craft.  I have also seen strange lights over that area, but tonight was very different.   After about two minutes, the aircraft turned around a quickly disappeared out of sight within seconds.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
oct,3,2013, 3:30 pm, cresent shaped craft.;2013-10-03 15:30:00;2 minutes;oct,3,2013, 3:30 pm, cresent shaped craft from my lanai i observed a bright glowing white sphere shaped object, like a star moving from the south to the north @ an extreme rate of speed, at an approximate 45 degree angle.  as it approached it turned into a flaming orange fireball much larger in size.   i thought at first it was a very large meteorite coming into the atmosphere, witch was very alarming due to its size. it dropped to an altitude of about 30 degrees.  the fire that engulfed it began to extinguish from the bottom of the craft to the top in just seconds.  there was a small triangle marking on the bottom, possible a way to exit the craft.  no symbols or markings, a dull tannish color, no other seams in the exterior.   the front of the craft as it came closer resembled the hull of a boat that staggered half way up.  the top of the craft was rounded, no windows, no lights, no external weapons, no wings, no sound, no trail behind it.   it made a severe right angle turn at the same fast speed and disappeared into a big white thunder head and was gone.   at first i thought is was rectangular in shape, but as it banked the turn, it was actually more of a crescent shape.  if it maintained the same direction it would have been miami probably within a few minutes.   october 3, 2013, thursday afternoon, between 3 and 4:00 p.m.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
Fleet of lots of small grey crafts or a couple of large rectangular crafts in see-through cloud, with what could be lots of dull lights;2019-09-29 23:45:00;10 seconds;Fleet of lots of small grey crafts or a couple of large rectangular crafts in see-through cloud, with what could be lots of dull lights It was a fairly clear night. I was outside in my backyard with my dog. I looked up in the sky and off to my left, the northern sky, I saw what looked like a white fast moving cloud that looked like smoke you could see through. I followed it as it moved across the sky. When it was pretty much directly in front of me,but very high up,I could see that it looked like a lot of identical,small oval shaped objects, in a formation that looked like a parallelogram, or large distorted triangular formation, with a loop at one corner and then a triangular formation of more of them at the end of the loop.  They were all connected, all identical,identical distance from each other.  They did not appear to be lighted but appeared to be grey in color.  After searching for similar formations online, after the sighting,I think it is possible that rather than it being a bunch of little crafts, it could have been a larger craft or a large one and a smaller one, and maybe what looked ! to me like multiple crafts could have been the lights on the crafts that were dulled by the clouds or distance and perhaps I couldn't see the body of the huger craft because it was so dark outside and maybe the body of the craft was black. The entire fleet or objects moved quickly across the sky, in my vision of sight from north to south, without any sound or vibration and was visible to me for about 10 seconds, if that, and was then out of my sight.I didn't have my cellphone on me to take a photo. Not sure it would have come out if I did.  The objects were very pale to me and moved very quickly.  I did make a very basic drawing of what I saw if anyone would like to see it.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542

It's movement was erratic, going fas then slowing down. It was definitely in an orbital pattern and had the same brownish gold brown hue as Mars. It possible had smaller 'bow tie' ends at either end of the main rectangle shape.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542

Tried to figure out what it was but saw no plane that might be pulling it across the sky plus it seemed too large to be a banner.  Grabbed my phone to try and get a picture but power lines got in the picture and by the time I got past them, the object had travelled out of my view.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
