Black Triangle, clearly seen slowly moving over Alligator Alley March 1st  6:15AM;2002-03-01 06:15:00;3 Minutes;Black Triangle, clearly seen slowly moving over Alligator Alley March 1st  6:15AM I was traveling south on Interstate 75, 11 miles south of Naples, Florida on Friday morning, March 1, 2002. I was listening to AM 610 WIOD and preparing to pull over, to watch the space shuttle launce at 6:22 am, on it's mission to upgrade the Hubble telescope. The sky was quite overcast, and the sun was just beginning to light up the clouds, although it had not yet risen. I noticed an object in the sky to my front left. It had 3 tiny white lights. As it came closer, at a very slow pace, I was able to make out the shape very distinctly as a triangle. It was flying low, well below the clouds, and the afore mentioned lights were at each apex. It was totally black, and the lights did not illuminate any portion of the craft. When I realized what I was looking at, I pulled over to the side of the road, and shut off the engine to listen as it passed. It was traveling west-northwest and passed by over a period of approx 3 minutes. I was sitting in the van I was driving with the window down, engine off, and I could not hear any sound at all. The traffic in that area was very light, and I actually cannot remember if another vehicle passed by me during this time or not. I turned the ignition to aux to have the radio come back on, to know when the shuttle was launching, and looked back and the object was simply gone. I got out of the van, and looked around the sky, but there was nothing. There were no contrails in the sky as well. I might note also that I travel this area twice a week, and very rarely see any conventional aircraft at all. The shuttle launch was not visible due to the clouds. As a side note, before I left on this trip, I set the digital clock on the radio to sync with my local radio station from Tampa (970 WFLA) and after this event, the van clock was two minutes slow. The reason I set the clock, was the van had had a starter replaced the previous day, and the clock was hours off. When I got back to the Tampa listening area Tuesday evening, the clock was still 2 minutes slow.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
Triangle craft with lights flying over Naples Airport;2006-09-20 05:30:00;12 seconds;Triangle craft with lights flying over Naples Airport At approximately 5:30-5:45 am I was dropping off a friend at the Naples Airport.  When I got out the car I looked up at the sky and noticed the sky was clearer that it's been in quite a while. I immediately noticed a triagle craft floating by with absolutely no sound. I watched it for a few moments and told my friend to look as I pointed. He then says what the @#%* is that!!! The craft had white lights around the perimiter. It was very vivid and low enough to see it was NOT an airplane. By the time I saw it, it was almost directly overhead and had to have passed over the airport or real close to it. It was traveling southeast.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
Triangular object rapidly crossing the sky with sideward movements.;2008-01-11 23:35:00;8 secs;Triangular object rapidly crossing the sky with sideward movements. Around 11:35pm in Naples Fl. My wife and I were watching the stars from the lanai (unscreened) and observed a UFO crossing the sky at a very rapid speed, faster than any aircraft manmade.  The object had bright lights, three of them total, one that appeared to be in the middle and one on each side.  The object was moving so rapidly that the lights looked deim.  The object was triangle in shape with rear of the object perturding outward.  The object that one point made a unusal manuever that could not be completed by a manmade aircraft.  At the rate of speed it was traveling to make a sideward movement as it did would have been impossible with our aircrafts.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
A dark flying V.;2008-10-11 19:30:00;30 seconds;A dark flying V. A dark, flying V overhead moved toward the clouds, not emitting any lights, only reflecting lights from the ground. It moved into the clouds and did not reappear. It did not make any sounds. There seemed to be several small dark objects attached to the underside of the V.

Triangle shape the strip it look to be bounce up sideways and down really fast.;2020-12-10 00:00:00;3 minutes;Triangle shape the strip it look to be bounce up sideways and down really fast. I was at work. Went out front of the restaurant to have a cigarette. I went to sit down on the bench. Light my cigarette and sat back and looked up. As I scaned the sky for stars I saw a light, at first I thought it was a shotting star butit was moving to show, So I just took my phone out to take a picture to see what it was. It didn't look right. So I got up and went to the side of the restaurant to see what it was doing. My co worker came out so I turned to him to show him and this time I recorded it because it just looked like something. So it kinda got so far away we couldnt see it anymore. So as we went back to work I started looking at the images and yes its something triangler. It looks maybe a L shape it looks like the L strip is a light. Flat on the bottom.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
