2 light objects far up in sky over 75 between exits 19 and 18;2002-01-16 00:10:00;don't know;2 light objects far up in sky over 75 between exits 19 and 18 I was driving along I-75 last night from Ft. Myers to Naples when I saw an object in the sky. It was bright, and it seemed like there was more than just the light, but too far away to make out a shape. It wasn't a star or a plane or a planet. It kept moving with me as I headed to Naples. It was really, really far up and seemed distant--not like how most people see stuff close. Between exits 19 and 18 there were two empty cars parked together on the side of the road (contacts?). As I kept going another object crossed the path of the first and went behind my car. The other object remained visible until I got home. ((NUFORC Note:  Event may have been a missile launch, possibly from a submarine.  Please see other reports.  PD));26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
4 circular lights that spun in circles, than became one, than repeated the cycle over again.  ((Advertising lights??));2002-04-10 22:30:00;30 seconds or so;4 circular lights that spun in circles, than became one, than repeated the cycle over again. First noticed them at while walking towards end of the dead end street.  There were  4 circles of light that would come together as one, then break apart again.  The real bizarre thing was they started to follow us as we made our way back to the house.  We were walking very rapidly out of fear.  They eventually come very close to the house, but still high up in the air.  This happened awhile ago I just never acted on it, figuring it has to have an explanation.  However to all I have shown it to, I have yet to get an answer.  Everyone I know states they have never seen anything like it.  Which leads me here.  I can't really explain it too well it is something that must be seen. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have observed advertising lights.  PD));26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
3 lights moving in sky - 1 light on horizon - Florida Gulf coast;2004-03-28 22:50:00;40 minutes;3 lights moving in sky - 1 light on horizon - Florida Gulf coast Sitting on the beach In Naples, Florida at 10:50 p.m. me and my friend saw what we thought was a bright star sitting there for a few minutes. We then saw a bright light flash on the horizon as if it was signaling the light up north towards Cape Coral and Sanibel Island. The light farther north glowed bright enough to see a reflection in the water and then all of the sudden it slowly split into three glowing objects. One went right  and one went left leaving the original duller but in the same place. The light on the right went faster and eventually behind trees out of sight. The one on the left stopped and went back to the original light and made it glow. At that moment the one on the horizon blinked again. While the north light disappeared leaving a dark spot in the sky. After about 4 or 5 minutes we thought it was gone when right in front of our eyes the Light on the horizon blinked again  and the light to the north reappeared. It glowed so bright this time that we compared it to the ALMOST full moon because the reflection on the water. The light then  split into three objects again and formed a triangle ( the light to the north) that moved across the sky slowly then darted out of sight the right which would be east. At that point we left the beach and told my friend’s parents about it and went to bed to leave early in the morning. When we came home we told another friend who told us to look it up on the internet and then  we found http://www.spacepub.com/users/data/sightings/flo/flo.htm. which had a reference to your sight. The date today is Monday March 29.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
Four Dancing Lights in the Clouds;2005-03-17 20:30:00;2 hours;Four Dancing Lights in the Clouds I was walking my dog and it was a rainy, misty night. Ilooked up into the night sky and saw what I first thought to be Kleig Lights making dancing patterns in the sky - but only in heavy clouds. As I continued walking I noticed that these four lights were moving a bit too erratically to be ordinary advertising lights. Throughout the night I kept going outside to find that these dancing lights had changed positions in the sky many times. Sometimes they were hovering right at tree level and other times they were way up overhead. At one point a low flying aircraft flew overhead and the lights disappeared briefly only to reappear down the roan and below the horizon.  As I gazed at them, I almost became mesmerized by the patterns they were making and my eyes were drawn to the meeting point when they would all suddenly dart or dive together. They appeared to change color slightly to light green, pink and blue.  I have absolutely no doubt that this was not a normal occurence. I ran in and got my room mate to come out to witness and she agreed that these lights were not from an airport or advertising display. Neither of us have ever seen anything like it in our lives.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542

After about 3 min. it flew away. As it flew awaay, the bright light began to blink. I recorded it on my camera and have it on videotape.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542

There was a very, very bright white light.   My perception was that it was very low, just above the tree tops, and about the size of a dinner plate.   It traveled very fast -- so fast that it appeared to have a light tail.  There was no sound.  At first I thought it was a meteorite but the travel was horizontal, west to east, and it was too big.  A meteor that big and low would have crashed somewhere close.  This was in the north Naples, FL area and the whole thing lasted about three seconds.  I don't scare easily but this really freaked me out!  I would be interested to know if anyone else saw anything.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
UFO SIGHTING IN NAPLES, FL AUGUST 20th, 2008;2008-08-20 22:20:00;4 minutes;UFO SIGHTING IN NAPLES, FL AUGUST 20th, 2008 I was coming home from work and parked in my usual spot. When I was about to get out of my car, something caught my eye so I looked up and it was a shooting star. I kept looking to see if another would pass by and this time it was what looked like a star, moving slowly Southeast. I kept watching it and after about a minute, it disappeared. I was very shocked, but then I saw two more coming from the same area going the same direction, following each other. Then another light shows up out of nowhere on the right side, moving towards the other two lights. They met and the new light began leading the way going Southeast downwards towards Earth. After about 2 minutes, they just vanished. I was in awe at this point, I didn't know what to do. Then four other lights showed up coming and going from the same directions and vanishing.

Amber light floats over Naples UFO or ???;2010-01-25 19:00:00;1 min;Amber light floats over Naples UFO or ??? I'm a 23 year old security officer at work in Naples by Marco.  I'm also a private pilot.  The time was about 7PM.  I walked outside of my gatehouse and was looking west toward the ocean.  Its a very clear night with unlimited visibility. I can see stars and jets at 30k feet strobe lights flashing. Out of the corner of my eye to the north I could see what I thought was a jet landing at fort myers intl airport or Naples even.  The light was small and amber in color like a Boeing jet.  It had a little kind of comet tail that was the same color as the light behind it that I could see as it moved closer and passed over my head going south.  It moved from north to south like it was flying down the Florida coast but at 50-100k feet.  It was moving a lot faster then the other jets and had no flashing lights of any kind.  It took maybe 45 seconds to a minute for the light to disappear over the South horizon.  It looked like a star floating across the sky.  Perfectly round amber light.  I thought it was a jet until it passed over my head going south and it was just as bright as it was coming at me.   Like the headlights of a 737 coming at you but when its going away.?  Jets don't use landing lights on at cruise altitude?  The object appeared to be very high and was moving quicker then the other jets that I could see and pick out in the sky.  I saw a amber ball of light travel from North to South at a high rate of speed that didn't look like anything I have ever seen before including the ISS. I also witnessed the 3 red lights over Naples park on new years.  It was a nice size triangle with 3 red lights that hovered and took off north. If looked like it had to be huge.  I couldn't see a outline but it looked to be one object.  There's a movie of it on you tube.  This thing whatever it was flew around and took off to the North without makeing a noise.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
Bright star looking light with red ring which is only seen with zoom;2011-09-14 23:30:00;unknown;Bright star looking light with red ring which is only seen with zoom I’m a 47yr old Mother of two adult daughters.  I took my dogs out for their nightly walk.  Noticed a nice full moon, (I was viewing East of me) and saw “airplane” lights down to the left side of the moon,…took a double look to watch it fly in, but it didn’t move any closer.  There wasn’t any sound either so I thought it must be an unusually bright North Star night.  But it seemed too bright to be the North Star so I continued to look harder at it.    I wasn’t sure if I was seeing one or two lights at that point.  Although my camera isn’t the best, I figured I’d try to get a picture “just in case” it really was a UFO.  Tried to get it on my cell phone but I’m not sure if I captured it.  Then I got three pictures on my still camera.  Came in the house and uploaded only to see squiggle lights.  I had it on 10x zoom without a steady hand.  I ran and grabbed my tripod and took more pictures using the 2 second delay to avoid shake.  Assuming this camera wouldn’t have the ability to capture anything anyway, doubled with the fact that mosquitoes were feasting upon me, I couldn’t stay out there.  Instead I amused myself by uploading the pictures anyway.  Nothing but blur until the last two shots.  When I zoom in on the picture using the picture viewer zoom, I wasn’t really expecting to see anything different but there appears to be a difference..?  This time there is a red ring on the light. I’m wondering if someone else could use a better zoom to check it.  not that it would likely matter anyway, but I’m following through.  It is now 12:14 am and I’m going to go see if it is still there. Yes, it is still there so it must be the North Star and some optical illusion occurred on the picture?  Should I forward you the picture anyway?;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542

Circle of Different color flashing light over gulf in naples;2013-10-11 20:00:00;Few Hours;Circle of Different color flashing light over gulf in naples So for about a month now I have noticed a light that changes colors over the gulf looking from the Vanderbilt Beach area.  It changes colors, red, green, and yellow.  It constantly flashes, it is there every night but varies in position in the sky and brightness.  If you concentrate you vision on it u can spot red flashes around it.

Bright green light zigzags over the Gulf of Mexico.;2013-12-13 19:20:00;12-15 seconds;Bright green light zigzags over the Gulf of Mexico. While taking out the trash to the side of the house in which I live in 	Naples Park, Florida, I observed a bright, steady green light traveling rapidly due south to my west.   I at first thought it was a helicopter flying low over the area of Vanderbilt Beach on the Gulf of Mexico, but realized that the light was not strobing as any F.A.A. certified aircraft would.   Venus was very bright at about 20º from my southwest horizon, and the light was heading in that direction until it stopped, remained stationary for a few seconds, then began reversing its course to the north.  As it did so, the light began strobing brightly, but no other lights were noticeable.   As the light passed behind a tall neighborhood tree which blocked my view, it apparently again stopped, for it never emerged from behind that tree.   I walked down the street to change my perspective, but could see no trace of the light thereafter.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542

Moved E on a horizontal path, stopping irregularly.  As it moved E,= its brightness fluctuated.  It grew to dim to see. Shortly following the disappearance of the orange light, a bright white light appeared in the S.  It traveled short distances and stopped irregularly as well.  It emitted three bursts of smaller white lights.  The last burst of lights proceeded to swirl around the main light and disappear.  The light faded away shortly thereafter. Roughly 3-5 minutes after the white light disappeared, 2 more orange lights appeared in the E and traveled SSE.  They were further on the horizon and more difficult to see.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
