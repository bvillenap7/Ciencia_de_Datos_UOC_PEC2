A very large, black, silent, boomerang flying very very fast over Naples, Florida.;1990-11-30 18:30:00;5 seconds;A very large, black, silent, boomerang flying very very fast over Naples, Florida. At first I did not submit a formal report because the incident happened so long ago, and I can no longer find the details I wrote down immediately after my sighting.  However, when I read the report on this website of a sighting in Naples, Florida on 11/3/2005 I couldn't help but be stunned. The reported sighting was almost identical to a sighting I had about 15 to 18 years ago.  I also live in Naples, Florida. The night of my sighting, I was walking down my driveway with my dog. It was less than an hour after sunset. I was walking from north to south. I looked up because I saw what I believed to be a satellite moving from west to east. For some reason I can't remember I thought it as Hubble. I watched the satellite until it disappeared into the dark side of the day/night terminator to the east. At almost the same time the satellite disappeared, there was movement directly above me.  Whatever the object was, it was absolutely flat black, and very very fast!  The sighting was so brief (only a few seconds), that I could only gather impressions of what I saw. Although the sky was dark and moonless, the object was so dark that I could see a boomerang shape against the slightly lighter night sky.  It seemed to be low,  and was very large.  Much larger than any airplane I have ever seen.  It was absolutely silent. Not a hiss or whoosh came when it passed overhead. For some reason I had the feeling the leading edge of the shape was just a very little lighter than the trailing edge.  Basically, I saw a very dark object against a slightly lighter, clear black sky blocking out the stars.  The weather was clear, with a few clouds on the southern horizon.  The star Fomalhaut was clearly visible above the clouds to the south.  The thought has occurred to me, the object was intentionally flying near the edge of the terminator in order to remain in darkness.  When I checked the date and time of the 11/3/05 sighting, I found that the position of the terminator would have been similar to my sighting.  The largest discrepancy in the two sightings is that my object was traveling in a north to south direction, rather then the northeast to southwest direction of the 11/03/05 sighting.  I can still see the object in my minds eye, although some of the detail has been lost.  It is something I hope I will never completely forget.

A HUGE boomerang shaped object , silent, no lights, traveling EXTREMELY fast over the Naples Florida skies;2005-11-03 18:40:00;5-7 seconds;A HUGE boomerang shaped object , silent, no lights, traveling EXTREMELY fast over the Naples Florida skies Something in the night sky that shouldn't have been there!  On Thursday, November 3, 2005 at approximately 6:40pm in Naples Florida -it was a clear and starry night sky when a HUGE movement caught my eye.  It was a HUGE (minimum 50 times the size of a single engine aircraft..that's the minimum...)boomerang shape, no color, silent, no light, matte, again..  EXTREMELY HUGE object that blocked the sky. Flying very low - approximately 500-1000ft.  What is that?... Do you see that?..She saw it too! In the time I said that it was gone. So it was traveling EXTREMELY FAST! We saw it a maximum of 5 seconds! It was traveling from northeast to the southwest..heading towards the Gulf of Mexico.  I called the local sheriff's office to report it. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we found the witness to be quite impassioned about the sighting, and seemingly quite sincere and credible.  We have invited the other witness to submit a report of what she remembers, as well.  PD));26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
UFO siting on Allegator Alley;2008-12-18 18:43:00;20 min.;UFO siting on Allegator Alley While driving accross Alligator Alley tonight, my sister called me to report a UFO siting at mile marker 95 heading west at 18:43 .  They were shaped like stars, and one left the formation of a V, and then came back.  As she was driving west there were 2 on her right, and two, then only one on her left.  They were stationary except when the one left then came back within 2-3 minutes.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
Two pulsing red/white orbs in the full moon night sky around 7:30 Sunday evening, Jan 11, 2009.;2009-01-11 19:30:00;2:00;Two pulsing red/white orbs in the full moon night sky around 7:30 Sunday evening, Jan 11, 2009. I was out around 7:30 Sunday evening, January 11, 2009, walking my dog. The full moon was just rising and illuminating the sky. It was a beautiful night and warm for winter here in East Naples, FL. I would gaze at the moon, marveling at how beautiful it was as it was rising into the night sky and then pay attention to my dog. My dog is an elder fellow and is blind so I need to be careful to keep an eye on him and give the correct ‘signals’ to help him navigate. I noticed groupings of several people, some were talking around a golf cart and some were partying, or at least that is how it sounded. Both groups were far enough away from me that I could not converse with them nor did I know who they were so therefore I was unable to ask them if they had seen what I just saw in the full moon night sky. I gazed up and saw two pulsing red/white orbs circling each other to the right side of the moon. They were pulsing light objects with red in the center with bright white around the perimeter of each one. They moved in unison and always parallel to one another. They seemed to be equidistant from each other. If one moved up, the other kept the same distance or so it seemed to me. It took me a few seconds to realize what my eyes were seeing. These pulsing orbs of light were playing with each other and then suddenly the pulses started to dim and they were gone. I kept looking up to see if they showed up at any other place in the night sky, but they were gone. I would guess that they were not visible by me for more than 2 minutes tops. Or at least once I noticed them in the night sky. I immediately walked my dog and I back home as fast as I could and let my husband know exactly what I had seen. He could tell I was excited about this episode!! I have searched the Internet this morning to see if I could find anything about this episode and that is how I came upon your site. I am not sure what I saw, other than it was an unusual sight. One I have never seen before nor will I forget. It stayed with me long after I saw them last night.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542

Illuminated white cigar shaped center with 1 red light in center of it. Illuminated white triangle shaped wings on either side.;2019-09-01 03:45:00;5 seconds;Illuminated white cigar shaped center with 1 red light in center of it. Illuminated white triangle shaped wings on either side.  Swooped very fast just above me. I first thought I was seeing a shooting star, but thought it was too low for that. I looked closer then and it came to a dead stop where I clearly made out it's shape. It remained for a second or so and then it disappeared. I'd say that it was definitely below cloud height and the size of a bus or larger. It was large enough to see it clearly. It made no sound. I continued to watch the sky for a good 5-10 minutes, but saw nothing again. When I came inside I immediately drew a picture of what I saw. I can't explain what it was, but I saw what I saw.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
Small dark object tracking linearly at constant speed over gulf;2020-09-07 11:30:00;1-2 minutes;Small dark object tracking linearly at constant speed over gulf Date: 9-7-20 Time: approx. 11:15 am - 11:45 am EDT Location: Naples, FL on the beach Conditions: partly cloudy (cumulus variety), light breeze from W/NW, calm seas   As I was sitting on the beach facing west out over the gulf, I noticed a small dark object tracking very linearly from right to left (heading south) over the gulf. At first I thought it was a bird, but saw no indication of wing movement or change of direction.  The object passed in front of the cumulus clouds. If I had to scale the object, it appeared compact like a dot, but in the same size grouping as a bird.  Still, no detail like wings or change of course.  What got my attention was the lack of any organic variation in its movement. Just constant speed and linear track. Everything else in the sky (like birds) had variations. Later as I saw large birds against a similar set of clouds, it was quite easy to see their wings and variations in movement. Had the object passed behind the clouds, I would have dismissed it as a plane.  I started estimating angles, based upon a 90 degree relationship between the gulf and directly overhead. Bisecting that angle, it appeared that the object was in the 35-40 degrees above the horizon. As for the time I could see it (1 - 2 minutes), I would estimate that it covered a field of 45 - 90 degrees, as it moved right to left (assuming I'm perpendicular to the gulf facing west).  I didn't have my phone with me during the sighting, but walked back to the car within the hour. I took a few pictures of similar clouds if  I need to get a better estimate on distance and angles. Further, I took video of birds flying just to demonstrate to myself that wings and organic flight behavior are obviously different than what I saw.  Was it a drone monitoring crowds on the beach? Possibly. But it seemed too far away. Drones are often closer, and usually show more variation in movement.  I've been interested in UFO's since a child. Although I've had unexplained life experiences, I don't recall any remarkable UFO sightings. While the sighting today was oddly out of place, it was certainly not sensational. I think it will only have meaning if others report similar events en masse.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
