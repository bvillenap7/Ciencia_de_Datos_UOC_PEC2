Sighting on Vanderbilt Beach, Naples, Florida.;2010-05-01 19:47:00;5 minutes;Sighting on Vanderbilt Beach, Naples, Florida. Went to Vanderbilt Beach in Naples, FL to watch the sunset with two other people.  The object appeared within moments after the fully set and visually appeared to be approximately 5-8 miles off the coastline.  The object was cigar shaped, it was vertical and looked like a ray of light in the sky. It sat stationary for about two minutes.  It began to move at the pace of a jet airliner although. Suddenly, it stopped and then sat stationary again for about 30 seconds, after that it began to move closer, maybe a mile, nothing more than that. It started to move around again at a jet airliner pace in the sky but it swayed back and forward. After about five minutes of witnessing the entire phenomena, it quickly dissipated and faded into the atmosphere.  Its camouflage mechanism made it hard to capture a phone picture.  Additionally, the twilight was not helpful in trying to get a photo as the entire sky blended in. Others that witnessed the sunset and the unusual sighting directly following the sunset that evening were talking about it amongst each other although no group made a big deal about it. I should probably mention that I posted a Facebook post about the sighting to my friends and after I posted that, Facebook on my phone coincidentally is all in Spanish and I cannot get it back into English anymore.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
