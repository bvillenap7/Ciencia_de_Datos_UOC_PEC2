UFO seen in night sky over Naples, FL;2007-09-17 05:45:00;5 seconds;UFO seen in night sky over Naples, FL This morning I saw a UFO - I don't know if somebody can identify it or if it was a flying saucer.  At about 5:45am edt I was walking my dog.  It was a starry night, pitch black, except for street lights.  As I was approaching my house, about 200 feet away, I saw this whitest saucer-shaped thing silently glide VERY LOW over the roof of my house.  I have a pine tree in the back yard & it looked like it was just above the top of the tree. NO SOUND, NO LIGHTS on it of any kind. Gliding much faster than a plane it was gone in a couple of seconds behind trees on my neighbor's property.  I am used to seeing planes over my property since I live near our local airport.  I always walk early in the mornings & see many planes with their red, green & white lights.  This was NOT a plane.  It was moving from the west to the east in a straight line and left no trail behind it.  The width of it seemed to be about the width of my roof but it probably was further south than it looked so it could have been larger.  Very little height - like I was seeing only the edge of a saucer. I could see it because it was a light color against the black sky.  I wanted to call the police & ask it anyone else had reported it but was afarid they would laugh at me.  That is why I am contacting you to see if others have reported this.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542

PD )) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Last evening I filed a report of a disk shaped object in Naples, Florida seen in the early morning, I wish to withdraw this report, as I am watching the object again, and it is clearly the morning star. Yesterday I was watching it through binoculars on my linai, which has a bug screen. The magnification of the lens on the screen must have caused the illusion of separate lights and windows. I apologise for wasting your time. ((END ADDENDUM));26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
