Two objects that appeared to be fireballs coming from the North sky in Naples Florida;2011-11-05 21:10:00;10 minutes;Two objects that appeared to be fireballs coming from the North sky in Naples Florida At approximately 22:10 on 11/5/11, I was leaving work and noticed a red fireball object coming toward the building.  I yelled out to a co-worker and he stepped out of the building, I told him to turn around and look up.  I asked him what he thought it could be and he said a hot air balloon.  I said then what is that coming from the north, as he turned around, he saw another object that was exactly the same following the first one.  We know it was not a plane or jet, as it did not have any sound as it disappeared toward the south sky.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
Good-sized orange fireball coming from Gulf of Mexico in Northeast direction over Naples;2012-07-27 21:00:00;2 minutes;Good-sized orange fireball coming from Gulf of Mexico in Northeast direction over Naples On Saturday night, about 9:00 P.M.  E.D.S.T. seen from Naples  FL looking west southwest out over the Gulf of Mexico, we saw what appeared to be a large orange fireball at about 40 to  60 degrees elevation from horizon.  The sphere was about  one tenth the size of a full moon and was moving very slowly in an East Northeast direction.  It flared out (extinguished) at about 60 degrees where it appeared to have stopped moving forward, or toward us.  A smaller red light, but just as bright, seemed to be at the leading edge of the orange sphere. Last nightâ€™s sighting was the third that we have seen with this same description, with the previous two having come from the same direction  over the Gulf, but traveling much faster.  The last one was at the end of May  and burned out after going overhead and disappearing in the Northeast at about 25 degrees latitude.  The first one we saw would have been sometime last year.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
Fireball moving across the sky;2013-07-04 21:01:00;~3 minutes;Fireball moving across the sky My daughter and I went outside to see neighbors setting off fireworks.  I looked to the north and saw a very bright &quotfireball&quot heading west.  We frequently see night launches of rockets from Kennedy Space Center, and while this was similar, it seemed closer and it was heading the wrong way.  (The rockets always arch up and to the east.) This seemed to be moving about the same speed and had that same look as a rocket, but larger and brighter.  It got progressively smaller and and more dim.  I assume it was going higher and/or moving further away.  Could have been some sort of military aircraft, but there was only one, we could hear no noise and there isn't a military base near here.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542

I called to my fiancee to come look and he witnessed it as well.  It then changed direction and seemed to fizzle out and then completely disappear. It lasted under a minute.  The fire ball got larger and seemed as if it was coming towards us.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
