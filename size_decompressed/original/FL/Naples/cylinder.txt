My mom and I were going outside to walk our dog when she suddenly saw something high up in the sky.  I didn't see it at first but she pointed it  out.  There, I saw this bright-orange glowing object moving across the sky at a constant rate.  It looked like a stripe and it never slowed down. It was moving faster than any plane I've ever seen.  It made no sound, didn't leave a trail, and there were were no blinking lights.  I ran inside to grab the video camera but it vanished when I got back outside.  She said it just abruptly disappeared into thin air. I only got footage after the sighting.  I don't know what it was but we clearly saw it.  I'm interested in the paranormal as I will have a future hobby involved with the unexplained.  However, I'm open minded and resort to logic very often.  It couldn't have been a shooting star, a meteor, or a satellite.  It didn't look anything like them.  I looked at other photos of UFOs and found a picture of three of them that look identical to the one we saw.  I'm still trying to find a logical explanation.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
