My friend and I were driving north on Sunday night. I was the passenger and dozed off for the duration of a Sinatra song from an radio station in Miami, when I opened my eyes and saw appearing off to left of the road, up ahead if us, cloud-like material, as if being poured into a round pan, like a making a pancake, then a second right behind it, and then a third, at which time I asked my frined what the__is that? Although we were told not to stop anywhere in the Everglades, unless absolutey necessary, I said pull over! Let's go take a look! We got out of the car. and I cannot remember walking forward, but when we got up ahead of the car about 20 yards, the objects were NOT in front to the left of us, but up higher and absolutely  due West! They were 3 round clouds stationary, and I remember when I looked directly at them, they exploded like a flashbulb into 3 orangish-red ovals and started to move. No sound, no trail. I can still see myself looking up at the bottoms of the objects, and then, at the fastest  (warp?) speed I've ever seen shot straight up....leaving 3  spidery-like whitish lines in their wake.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542

The light looked to have come up out of the Gulf of Mexico.   Then it floated further up and away, because the light got dimmer.   Then one by one seven more came up and followed a similar path.   The lights seemed to wobble slightly, and change direction as they ascended.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
