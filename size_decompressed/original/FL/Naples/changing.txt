Two orange red objects hovering behind our house.;2015-11-18 20:00:00;5 minutes;Two orange red objects hovering behind our house. Around 8:15 PM.  My girlfriend and I went outside to walk our dog.  After about 2 minutes, we saw two objects moving slowly through the woods behind the house.  They were about treetop level and initially appeared to be round and then flattened a bit into a teardrop or mushroom shape.   The front most of the two went from a white-gold color to an orange flame hue.  The second was smaller and its color went from an orange hue to a deep red color and both of them had black outlines.  The smaller one almost had a tail to it.  They moved in a southwesterly pattern, though they seemed to be independently hovering and gently glided past the house.  The entire episode lasted about five minutes and we managed to get some cell phone video before they disappeared.  Will try to upload the video and submit it to you, though unsure how much it will reveal.  My girlfriend is drawing a picture of them.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
Flowing lights over Naples.;2016-09-30 23:22:00;15 seconds;Flowing lights over Naples. I walked out my back door to smoke and looked west toward the Gulf. I noticed a grouping of lights moving from north to south.  As soon as I noticed them, I began moving away from my porch light. The lights were a dull orange, as if covered by clouds.  At first it seemed to be like a glider, then similar to a dragonfly, to the point where the lights were flowing like on the tips of a manta ray. I followed further when the lights disappeared, only for a few seconds.  The disappearance was then disrupted by a bright circular flash, and then concluded.
