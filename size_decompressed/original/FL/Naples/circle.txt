All of us saw a craft in front of us hovering about 8-10 ft. above the water.  It was approximately 25 ft in front of us.  The craft was very large (About 30 ft. In diameter) and circular with sides that were on a slant outwards.  All sides were of a dark color or were black and shiny.  No windows were noticed. There were two different colors of lights on the outside of the craft. One was a white color. The other Im not positive, but I think was green.  The craft made a humming sound while hovering. When the craft took off, it went super fast and in directions airplanes do not fly.  There was no noticeable propulsion coming from the craft.  There was no smoke, fire, or plumes. It just took off. The next day in the newspaper was something about a UFO on the radar at the airport.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542

Bright white circle with light blue arura in the night sky.;2011-08-06 23:35:00;5 - 6 seconds;Bright white circle with light blue arura in the night sky. Tonight at around 11:35pm, I was sitting on my patio in Naples, FL. I looked N.E, about 40 degrees up & I seen a bright white ball, with a light blue aura around it.  It appeared in that spot and then started shooting straight down, diagonally towards the neighborhood lake, behind my house and then disappeared.  It was bigger than a star, but smaller then the moon.  It moved pretty quickly.   I have called the UFO hot line and talked with someone about what I have seen.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
Four very large orange glowing orbs arising from a nature preserve in North Naples Florida observed by 5 adults March .2013.;2013-03-20 21:30:00;8 minutes;Four very large orange glowing orbs arising from a nature preserve in North Naples Florida observed by 5 adults March 2013 The event occurred approximately at 9:30 pm on the evening of March 20, 2013 while out walking our dog.  Our community is surrounded by a nature preserve and to the north end there are are no developments for many miles which we verified with google earth.  We first observed a very large orange glowing orb which ascended from the north end of the nature preserve moving straight up in a fast but steady pace to quite a high elevation at which point it no longer glowed but we could still see lights as it traveled eastward.  Needless to say we were quite surprised when another glowing orange orb followed suit around 15 seconds later and did exactly the same as the first and joined the first orb.  This series of events happened 2 more times, four orbs in total.  The four objects travelled together in a straight line one after the other and then quickly disappeared.  We did not hear any type of engine noise at all and as this community is dead quiet at night if there h! ad been any type of noise being emitted we would have heard it.  We observed the first two orbs ourselves until our neighbours came out to greet a visitor arriving in a car and we then pointed out to them the last two orbs.  The night sky was very dark that night so it was difficult to tell if there was much cloud coverage.   While out golfing in the morning, the day after the event, two helicopters were seen circling over the area where the orbs appeared from.  The engines from the helicopters were clearly heard.   All observers we would estimate as being in their mid fifties, university educated .;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
Glowing orange light silently moving across sky in naples Florida 22:30 December 29, 2013.;2013-12-29 22:30:00;30 seconds;Glowing orange light silently moving across sky in naples Florida 22:30 December 29, 2013 December 29, 2013 Naples, Florida.  At approximately 10:30 on December 29, 2013 I was walking with my two children and a neighbour and we all noticed an orange glowing light in the sky.  At first glance I thought it was maybe one of the planets because it was relatively large however it was noticeably larger than any planet I've observed and was visibly moving.  For another split moment I thought maybe it was some sort of fireball - such was the colour and shape.  However its movement seemed steady and the shape/size consistent. Also there appeared to be a very slight crescent glow (where the bright spot would be at the top centre of the crescent). The light traveled south and at first it seemed to be maybe nearing us slightly, but then appeared to travel away from us while still moving south.  Overall it was moving slowly - like an aircraft a few miles away.  Then it disappeared by fading out over a period of maybe 5 seconds (overall our sighting time might have been around 30 seconds - we didn't see it appear so don't know how long it was visible). There were no other lights around the orange 'ball' as we all wondered if it was the front lights (landing lights?) of an aircraft.  There is a private airport nearby that has small jets and other aircraft frequenting it.  The light however was definitely orange, not the clear/white we normally observe.  Also there were no accompanying flashing lights.  Also there was no sound and it was a quiet evening. There were some clouds in the sky, however it was mostly clear in this area at the time.  There were stars visible in the sky.  Later in the evening at around 11:00 we went outside to watch the sky again, but clouds at that point covered almost all of the visible sky.  We ultimately thought that maybe it was one of those floating lanterns and landed on that conclusion.  Hopefully this information is helpful.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
When I looked up into the sky I saw a Purple Disk and though it was a Comet, but it was too slow and Comets aren’t Purple.;2014-10-15 21:30:00;10 seconds;When I looked up into the sky I saw a Purple Disk and though it was a Comet, but it was too slow and Comets aren’t Purple. I was leaving the Beach and I look up in the sky and see a Purple Disk moving slowly across the sky leaving a faint purple trail,  At first I thought it was a Comet. But then I did a lot of research (I was ten at the time) and there is no such as a Purple Comet, nor was there anything about it, it was too spectacular to not have been scene by anyone else,  I am unsure exactly what it was, but I know definitely wasn’t a Comet. The object was much to strange to identify at the time. I wish I could’ve had a Photo but I had no Cameras in me at the time.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
Naples, Florida, ufo sighting!;2015-06-02 00:00:00;10 minutes;Naples Florida ufo sighting! Me and my wife stepped outside around 12:00am for some fresh air.  We live in Naples, Florida, where there's not much activity going on where we stay.   Around midnight, I look up in the sky (sw side) and see this object flashing different colors green, blue, yellow, white and red.  What amazed me the most is the way it moved , first in a erratic circular motion. then it moved to random but creative ways of direction, (triangular or oval movements as if it was making a symbol or message, criss crossing thru the sky.   Shortly after, it then moved in ways that if you tracked where it was from point a to point b, you could see its almost as if it was forming symbols for communication or attention.   I grabbed my camera and started recording and taking pictures.  Strangely my camera started malfunctioning as I took pictures and videos.  It was shot from my iPhone , however when you see the video you can clearly the object and me chasing the object thru the sky.  It disappeared then appeared out of nowhere in a different direction.   I'm really wanting to share this with everyone because its rare to sight ufos where I live in Florida.  It was not a plane, nor a star or a satellite simply because it was moving consistently, the colors, the way it illuminated, making unique movement as if it was forming symbols for communication.  Here are the pics and link to videos, you be the judge.  I might not know much about astrology but I know for sure this was not a natural occurrence.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1SSwf6FYPSE  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=B4dZyp9AprE  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_-LaWTUV1zc;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542

In the eastern sky an object, round, bright red, and in a slightly irregular motion (like it was wobbling), heading northeasterly but slowly changed direction to head northwesterly.  There were no aircraft navigation lights, only a bright red-orange ball.   There were high clouds and the craft eventually disappeared in the clouds.  My line of sight was unobstructed.  I thought it may be an aircraft on fire, but the wobbling caused me to find this site.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
