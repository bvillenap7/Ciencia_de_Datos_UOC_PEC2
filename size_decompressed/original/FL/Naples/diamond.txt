Diamond-square shape hovering over I75 in Florida, tips illuminating blue!;2011-12-26 19:35:00;about 30 seconds;Diamond-square shape hovering over I-75 in Florida, tips illuminating blue! I had been driving from Delray, Fl to Naples, Fl and about halfway into my trip (in central Florida in between Naples and Plantation) I noticed that the moon seemed to be in some form of a lunar eclipse- the sky was pitch black.  This triggered my attention, and I seemed to be more aware of the sky since it was so dark and there were no lights on I75. About 15-20 minutes after I had noticed that the moon had completely disappeared I was driving and I saw a form maybe about 100-300 feet above the road going over my car.  It was large and in a diamond-square shape.  The corners of the object were illuminating a light blue color, and there seemed to be some sort of digital pattern on the bottom lighting up a light blue as well, but this section was more faint and the lighting was sporadic in different areas of the object.  There seemed to be a haze of blue around the object that seemed to be caused by a faint blue light lining the circumference of the form. It seemed to be traveling very low to the ground and was moving slow (in relation to a car going about 75 MPH.)  It was moving in the opposite direction of me, going East.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
Black diamond shaped object slowly moving in the sky.;2015-03-14 15:30:00;15 minutes;Black diamond shaped object slowly moving in the sky. Looked up, noticed something in the air.  It was slowly moving through the sky. It was diamond shaped and black.  Took a few pictures from my wife's phone and mine.  And 1 video.  Could have been about 1500 or lower in the sky.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542

It was a very strange star because it had 2red beans one at the top one the bottom.  It was very still has no movement and it was not flickering like a normal star.  It was very stationary for about 30 minutes before we lost inside to carry on our daily life.  About 15 minutes later as we walk back outside smoke a cigarette we saw that good white head disappeared but the other stars that were next to it are still in the same position.  It is very bizarre for a non flickering star to disappear like that especially one with 2redbeans from top and bottom.  This is not the first time that I have seen something like this in my lifetime.  But it has been a very long time since I have witnessed something this extraordinary happen.  If anyone else has had the same experience on the same day please share I am very curious to know.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
