twin orbs cross the entire sky at high altitude in a matter fo seconds (not meterorites);2001-11-18 05:30:00;five seconds;twin orbs cross the entire sky at high altitude in a matter fo seconds (not meterorites) Early Sunday mornning, I go out to see the leonid meteor shower, and I see several meteors at a time. Some crossing each other. The sky is dark. There are no clouds. We have few streelights in my neighborhood, and watching these showers has been a hobby of mine since I was in the Naval weather service. I know what satellites look like. I know what weather balloons look like. I know what jets look like. I spend a lot of time star gazing. I know altitudes from my weather days estimating cloud height. With all that in mind, I see from north to south at a REALLY high altitude (These are at the level of cirrus clouds, maybe higher) these two faintly glowing orbs side by side cross the sky at incredible speed (no port or starboard lights, just a faint orangy glow, totally different looking from meterorites). I can see them cross from when they enter my view at the peak of my roof to near the horizon in a matter of about five seconds. My eyes are totally accustomed to the dark. I have never seen anything like these before. I would love to know if anyone else saw them. Everyone keeps trying to tell me they were meteorites, and I know they weren't. They kept a steady speed, remained in a side by side formation and were a different color than the meteorites.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
Fuzzy lights over Naples, FL;2006-04-27 05:30:00;15 seconds;Fuzzy lights over Naples, FL Take this for what you will...While walking my dog, around 5:30am, behind the hotel I am staying at, I noticed 4 very fuzzy/hazy pale yellow lights traveling South to North at a very high rate of speed.  They were in what appeared to be the Missing Man Formation..which would seem to be an obvious explanation to the sighting, however, this occured about an hour before sunrise on a moonless, for the most part cloudless, morning.  The lights were also oval in shape, and absolutely no sound could be heard of any type of jet engine.  I observed them moving across the sky for about 10 seconds, before they disappeared into a cloud bank to the far north of where I was standing.  A few seconds later, the cloudbank lit up from what I would normally assume was lightning...but...after after seeing those lights, I'm not so sure.  I have a novice interest in astronomy, and observe the nighttime sky regularily...so to see this really caught my eye.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
Lights in Formation changed in brightness and moved within three minutes;2015-04-02 07:20:00;3 minutes (I viewed);Lights in Formation changed in brightness and moved within three minutes Early in the morning, I was driving down a major road when I saw several lights in formation in the sky.  As I was driving down the road, which lasted only 5 minutes at most, the lights changed in brightness and moved slightly.  At one point, the formation was reminiscent of Orion's belt.  This was early in the morning as the sun was coming up, so it was not a cloud, not airplanes (because those don't look like a star), and probably not stars because they moved and increased in brightness.  I was able to take a picture when I was stopped at an intersection.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
