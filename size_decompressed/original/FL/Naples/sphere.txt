Triangle shaped light formation of Florida golf coast.;2004-03-31 21:00:00;40 minutes;Triangle shaped light formation of Florida golf coast. A large Light appeared off the golf coast looking north from Vanderbilt Beach towards Sanibel Island. It was redish white and it brightened enough to make a reflective streak across the water within seconds. It seemed to have been sitting there for a couple of minutes before it brightened and grabbed our attention. It slowly started moving away from the coast and then out of nowhere streaked out of view at the horizon. Needless to say it was a jaw-dropping sight that grabbed our attention. Less than a minute later there was a bright ping of light that came from the horizon in the same redish white hue. It seemed to signal the original light to come back. It's difficult to say how far this was happening away from us on the beach but if i had to guess i would say at least a mile away. My friend disagreed and claimed to have seen a rounded triangle solid object but i could not make out enough detail to verify. As it moved across the sky slowly the object/light split in 3 objects and moved apart to form a triangle formation that moved in a way that kept the exact proportions of the triangle. Abruptly all three lights shot across the sky and disappeared. The acceleration and speed i could not guess but it was like nothing i've seen hundred of miles per hour. This whole process repeated a few times of reappearing and shooting off until it just stopped leaving me and my friend baffled and mystified by what was just witnessed. My name is Daniel and my friend Brett was also there. It was the last night of a vacation and it was a very silent night with the exception of the event. Never before had i given much thought to people describing their UFO events until this had happened. I don't claim to know what i saw but i do know as much as i can that it wasn't man made.

White sphere with contrail.;2005-06-28 13:00:00;about 2 seconds;White sphere with contrail. I was coming home from lunch. I pulled into the driveway and looked up at the cloads forming outside and saw what looked like a white sphere screaming across the sky just below the clouds. It left a contrail similar to the sphere in color. I don't know what ball lightning looks like but i don't think thats what that was because there was no normal lightning in the area at the time.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542
STARLIKE IN APPEARENCE. PRIMARY COLORS RED,WHITE,AMBER,[CARMEL COLOR];2006-08-17 22:00:00;30 MINUTES;STARLIKE IN APPEARENCE. PRIMARY COLORS RED,WHITE,AMBER,[CARMEL COLOR] IAND A FRIEND OF MINE, WERE OBSERVING THE LATE NIGHT CLOUDLESS SKY AT ROUGHLY 10:50 P.M., AND NOTICED A VERY ODD STAR. I KNOW THAT SIRIUS IS VISIBLE NEAR THE ORION CONSTELLATION AND I HAVE OBSERVED IT. HOWEVER, THIS WAS IN THE VICINITY OF SIRIUS, BUT CLEARLY IN FRONT OF IT,CLOSER TO OUR OBSERVATION POINT. AND IT WAS AWESOME TO SE!IT CLEARLY WAS NOT A STAR, NOR PLANET. WE DID NOT OBSERVE IT THE FOLLOWING NIGHT, BUT DID SEE SIRIUS! ASC WE OBSERVED THE LIGHTS,THE COLORS OF WHITE, RED AND AMBER,WE COULD MAKE OUT A SPINNING MOTION,ALSO IT WOULD DIM CONSIDERABLY, THEN THE RED WOULD BE PROMINENT AS TO THE WHITE. WE COULD DETECT THE ACTUAL SPIN OR MOTION, BUT WHERE IT WAS STATIONARY COULD SEE A LITTLE WOBBLE TO IT TOO. THESE GUYS CAN CAMOUFLAGE THEMSELVES TO LOOK AS A STAR DOES TO THE AVERAGE PERSON.

Two shooting stars in formation.  Where one appeared to have disintegrated in the sky like a normal meteoroid.;2009-08-30 04:00:00;15 minutes;I saw two shooting stars enter our atmosphere in formation.  Where one appeared to have disintegrated in the sky like a normal meteoroid, I saw a bright blue flash, this flashing continued, spaced out in succession, traveling south.  Shortly after I lost sight of it, the house cat that was accompanying me, took off running away from me, all the hair on my body stood up, even the hair on my neck, all of the nature around me became silent. At this point, the woods in front of me were lit up like the day for a second, then it shut off it's spot light, it flew just above the tree line and over the street and when it did, it shut off its ambient light, that's when I was able to see that it was a sphere, about the size of a Volkswagen beetle.  It flew directly above me at a high rate of speed and as it did, I saw the reflection of the sodium street lights and the darkness of the tree line in the reflection off this thing.   When I entered my home, it was exactly  4:15 AM, for some reason that seemed suspicious to me.;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542

We look up and there are 3 red lights. Equally spaced apart in a straight line.  All of a sudden they moved north (together) then stopped in a triangular formation.  It hovered there for about a minute or so then the light at the north end dimmed and disappeared following by the light on the bottom right corner.  We stood watching when the final red orb also disappeared. It was bizarr-o.  Definatly has me doing a little more research today. Here is my video. pardon the language. it was new year eve and we were a litte surprised:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zNHvvULhwQ;26.1913990654204;-81.722449906542

Blinking light passed across the sky from W to E and was completely out of visual range in about 20 seconds.  The craft did not make any sound.   My brother-in-law and I saw a number of jets flying this same evening, which took a couple minutes to travel the same distance and could be heard.
