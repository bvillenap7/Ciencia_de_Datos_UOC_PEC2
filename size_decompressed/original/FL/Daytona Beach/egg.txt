Orange sphere appeared, turned, blinked, then faded away into the distance;2004-03-12 02:14:00;2 min;Orange sphere appeared, turned, blinked, then faded away into the distance My friend and i were going out and as we were driving only 50 yards from his house in plain sight we noticed an object in the sky. It almost looked like it was on fire moving at a slow speed.We pulled over in a parking lot to look at it. It moved from south to north. As we looked at it, it slowly started to get smaller in size almost like it was moving away. It did not have a sound and did not have a recognizable shape. It took off at a high speed almost like it was going out to space. It got smaller considerably in size and looked like a star. Much brighter than all the other stars, then it dissappeared. With in about 2 seconds it flashed one last time and was gone. What we saw sounds exactly what someone else saw on this website. The only differance was the time frame and location, but it was close to us. I dont think this object was a plane. It moved to slowly and then took off too fast out of sight. If any one else has seen this object in the Florida area let us know. It is my second time seeing the object and the first time for my friend. If anyone might have an answer to what it might be let us know.;29.2092113466332;-81.0318598503743
