This cigarette shaped object spun without an axis of rotation!;1987-11-01 20:00:00;1min;This cigarette shaped object spun without an axis of rotation! I was 15 and am now 31.   We were driving along the beach after having had dinner that night.  I can't remember what exact month it was (it was Sep, Oct or Nov) and I now for sure that there was smoke on the horizon line that night from wildfires that had recently swept through several parts of Florida.   There were about 6 surfers heading toward the waves with surf boards under their arms.  They were pointing up and then I saw it....a cylinder like a cigarette shaped thing with lots of lights.  The lights were rectangles some on their sides and some standing up.   It was ridiculus.  I can remember that there was no order to these lights.  Isn't craft supposed to have symmetrical lights?  The light source seemed to be soft fluorescent and didn't shine outward.  The lights were soft white and there was nothing visible behind them.  I estimated the craft was at least as long as a football field.   Anyhow after about a solid 45 seconds of this the lights shut off and two purple lights appeared, one on each end of the thing.  Never at anytime did the thing make a single noise.  Then it started to move away slowly and began to spin wildly.  The spin was unlike anything that could be reproduced in any object having mass.  It spun out of control with no axis of rotation and dissappeared into the southwest sky.   That last split second it went from being just hundreds or so feet over the Atlantic to out of sight.  So the distance was like 500 miiles travelled in about one tenth of a second.  There was no light trail like the kind the starship Enterprise used to leave.  That is what I saw.   My mom and my step dad both saw it too but claim now that they can no longer remember seeing it.  I saw this thing just last December, a photo, in my Encarta computer encyclopedia.  The only thing wrong with the Encarta picture is that the lights were purplish not reddish. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

Two drone-like objects over ocean at Daytona Beach early evening.;2017-08-12 19:00:00;10 minutes;Two drone-like objects over ocean at Daytona Beach early evening. My husband and I watched what looked like a drone with a light under it over the ocean near the shore in Daytona Beach.  It was moving south to north and then it turned heading east over the ocean until it left our vision over the ocean.  We were wondering what we just saw when another drone-looking object came by going south to north on exact same path of travel and then also went east and finally left our vision over the ocean.  I took a couple of distant pictures and the object when zoomed (fuzzy) looks more like a cylinder with metal rings around it.  I just wish I had had a camera with a powerful zoom lens.  The object is just a dot in the picture.  I don't think a personal drone could have flown that high and far. Possibly military drone?;29.2092113466332;-81.0318598503743
