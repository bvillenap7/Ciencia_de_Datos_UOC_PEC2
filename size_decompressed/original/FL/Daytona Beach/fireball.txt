I was watching the Daytona Beach live cam, so this event is probably recorded, I believe  *the time on the cam was 05:30 something* and right there was a large bright oval object emitting a metallic, sparkling like a fireball, it slowly rolled, like pouring itself into the ocean.  Friday at around and or after 2:00 am.;29.2092113466332;-81.0318598503743

Orange ball flame moving over ocean at 4,800 miles an hour.;2014-05-30 21:38:00;2 minutes;Orange ball flame moving over ocean at 4,800 miles an hour At 9:38 P.M. me and a friend stepped outside to leave my house.  I live right off A1A, 200 yards from the ocean in Daytona Beach Shores.  In a direction of SSE, we saw what I thought to be a rocket.  Not to miss the night launch, I called into my wife in the house to come out and see.   Most rockets disappear quickly here in the general direction they are launched, but even with taking her time of half a minute to come out it was still visible.  Only at this point instead of moving up in altitude, becoming more and more dim, it was moving across the horizon about 45 degrees high over the ocean until it disappeared at ENE.  It was an orange ball of flame like seen in launches.   I would estimate it traveled from Cape Canerval to Jacksonville (160 miles) slightly off the coast in about 90-120 seconds.   I couldn't find and information of a launch at 9:38 on 5/30 and would like to note heard no noise at all like when a military jet flies over the ocean.   I'm convinced it was a rocket flying over the coast but can't find any record of a launch so I'm reporting it as a UFO.;29.2092113466332;-81.0318598503743
A very bright fireball coming low in the sky from the east and then accelerating straight up and then leveled out in a straight path at;2017-01-14 17:51:00;10 minutes;A very bright fireball coming low in the sky from the east and then accelerating straight up and then leveled out in a straight path at a moderate speed as if it had a guidance system, lasted about 5 minutes, had a fiery glow the whole time, heading south west and then fading to a red light and then gone, 5 minutes later happened again the same way but trajectory was more south. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Definitely too low to be a jet, it was close enough that me and my 23 yr old son could see the flame flickering and to be exact, it literally passed right under the brightest night star (Venus) before it went to a constant red light then it almost seemed as if it went so far up and out that it disappeared. Thank you for writing back so quickly, i appreciate it. ((END ADDENDUM));29.2092113466332;-81.0318598503743
