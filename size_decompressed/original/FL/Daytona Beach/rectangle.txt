I was on a vacation trip, driving north to New York City from Florida to visit family friends.  I departed from Fort Lauderdale around 9:00pm in my car and with my cat on Interstate 95 North.  Around mile marker 167 on Interstate 95, south of Daytona Beach, I was listening to my Yanni cassette while driving 70 mph on a dark empty northbound freeway, looking around for any sign of town lights because it was very desolate in that particular area.  It was a scattered cloudy night with patches of clear Florida sky about 3:00 am on Tuesday morning, June 19, 2001.  I was looking around the road ahead when something caught my eye to the right.  At first, I thought it was going to be one of those bright beacon lights for aircraft on a hillside.  When I turned my head eastbound to look up to check what it was, I was captivated by the sight I saw through my windshield.  I immediately took my foot off the gas pedal and on my brakes to slow down as I watched this bright orange rectangular object, positioned in a vertical I angle in the night sky, gliding smoothly from behind one cloud in a horizontal direction and it disappeared behind another cloud.  I kept looking at that cloud for about five minutes to see if the object would appear on the cloud's opposite side, but nothing happened.  The bright orange rectangular object seemed to move quickly in a straight direction between those two clouds, therefore, I assumed it would fly out from the other side of the second cloud.  I had to take my gaze off this object every 30 seconds to watch the dark freeway ahead of me (which was a level straight stretch), so I was able to watch this strange object for approximately two minutes.  There were no rocket flares (I've seen the Fort Lauderdale Air Show on May 5th where Navy jets flew at night through clouds so I recognize the rocket glare from behind the aircraft and how it made the clouds glow), no extra lights emitted from it, no trail or glow of this object as it flew behind the second cloud.  I checked my mirrors and ! around t he dark stretch of freeway for other vehicles or road lights, but I was the only one on that part of dark Interstate 95 at that moment as my car's speed was down to 40 mph.  I did not feel scared, but was excited to realize that I may have experienced a UFO sighting for the second time in my life.  I am a 45 year old single female native New Yorker and have been residing in Florida for three years.  My first sighting happened in New York when I was around 10 years old, during a city blackout (probably mid 1960s) when our entire neighborhood saw a bright multi-colored oval object hovering in the sky.  I personally believe that there is a possibility of other civilizations in the universe other than our human race, so I felt honored to have seen proof with my own eyes.

Rounded Rectangular wings, no visible body, 2 lights on each side of the wings, resembling angel eye type lights.;2014-04-07 20:00:00;.5 minutes;Rounded Rectangular wings, no visible body, 2 lights on each side of the wings, resembling angel eye type lights. Hazy night, cloud bases approx. 500-700 feet broken. Sky conditions = no precipitation. Craft spotted flying over Daytona Beach International Airport at between 700-1000 feet AGL (Above Ground Level). The craft looked as if it had 2 sections of wings, but no visible body two bright lights shown on the BOTTOM (key part) of each wing.  As a pilot, i looked for anti collision lights (white strobes at the tip of each wing) and navigation lights (green light on right side, red on left).  I could not see either type of lights, and i am not familiar with any other kind of aircraft that is legal to fly at night with lights on the bottom of each of the wings.  The lights were not bright i could only see the outlines of the wings and the lights.  The lights on the bottom resembled angel eyes on tuner cars, much like a BMW type style.  The craft was a bit covered by the haze, but could be clearly seen.  The craft also did not make a sound, and moved about 100-125 KTAS (knots true air speed) along.  Also, the aircraft did not move in line with an approach or departure from the airport, as would be a giveaway if it was an aircraft. It moved at around a 45 degree angle from runway 34 departu! re end, right over the airport.;29.2092113466332;-81.0318598503743
