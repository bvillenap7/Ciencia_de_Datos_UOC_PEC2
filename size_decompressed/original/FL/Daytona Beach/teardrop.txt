Bright Star Like Object North of Daytona Beach, FL.;2014-09-14 22:00:00;7 minutes;Bright Star Like Object North of Daytona Beach Fl While standing on the boardwalk at Daytona Beach, Fl, at approximately 2200 hours a bright star like object appeared to the North over the ocean.  The object was large.  It first appeared the be a star but then rose as if to hover.  Movement could be seen while it continued its ascent.   The night sky was clear and stars could be seen in all directions.  The craft was bright.  It was not an aircraft.  There were no blinking lights like a normal aircraft would have.  After approximately 7 minutes the object disappeared as if someone had turned off a light switch.  The action was immediate.  I would estimate the altidude at 4 thousand feet or approximately a 45 degree angle from the beach to the sky.  I am 100 percent sure this was not a passenger aircraft or any other type of airplane.;29.2092113466332;-81.0318598503743
