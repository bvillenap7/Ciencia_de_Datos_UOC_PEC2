Two red lights manuevering  both stationary and at very high rates of speed.

Both performed unlimited climbs until disappering. That morning, was warming up for a fitness test at a local track. I was facing West when I noticed two red lights cruising at a high rate of speed from the North (the direction of Jacksonville) to the South Southwest(towards Orlando). Best guess of altitude was +20,000 feet. Sky was completely clear, morning twilight was beginning in the East. Initially thought the two lights were from the same aircraft and the red lights would have been position lights on the left side of the aircraft. However, I noticed no strobe lights, beacons, etc. which are normally present on aircraft. At exactly the same time, a passenger plane took off from Daytona Beach Int'l giving me a visual reference in the sky. I realized the two red lights were moving even faster than I thought and were two distinctly seperate objects. As they passed the due West position in formation, they shifted, without changing speed. Object #1 made several sharp turns and course reversals, then shot straight up into the clear sky until completely fading away. Object #2 stopped and stayed stationary during the manuevers of object #1. It then spiraled around the first object as it climbed out of view. Both lights diminished as they traveled farther up into the sky (unlimited climb). Aside from the momentary noise of aircraft taking off, no other noise during the quiet, calm morning. I am a civilian and military pilot and familiar with various types of high speed/highly manueverable aircraft. Absolutely none have that capability. While observing, I immediately was able to rule out any known aircraft, atmosphereic phenomena (clear sky, stars visible) and due to the maneuvers, rule out anything like meteors, pulsing stars, etc.;29.2092113466332;-81.0318598503743
Bright lights seen over ocean in Daytona Beach area on January 11, 2002;2002-01-11 18:45:00;more than 1 hour;Bright lights seen over ocean in Daytona Beach area on January 11, 2002 On January 11, 2002, at approximately 6:45 pm EST, I arrived home with one of my coworkers.  My roommate, my coworker, and myself were all of sound mind at the time, getting ready to have a few beers but hadn't quite taken that initiative yet all three of us work for the same company, a timeshare and travel agency in the Daytona Beach area, and none of us have ever made a claim or filed anything like this before.  My roommate was out on the landing, looking into the early evening sky when I heard him exclaim, What the hell is that?  I raced outside, thinking maybe he'd seen an accident of something, but he was looking up at a bright light in the sky.  Jupiter had recently been overhead, just one or two nights ago, so at first I thought it might by Jupiter or other planet, but it moved.  We were facing east at the time the object was over the ocean, and at great altitude.  He said that it seemed to be made of one light surrounded by smaller ones, but I was unable (at first) to make out those details with my glasses.  He ran inside to grab his binoculars our coworker came out to see what we were making a big fuss about, and when she saw the object she also said that it looked like multiple lights.  I grabbed the binoculars from my roommate and ran downstairs into the darkest area I could find in order to avoid any ground light.  When I zoomed in I could see that it definitely looked like one bright light surrounded by smaller lights.  However, the shape was not constant at one point it appeared to be a single light, then a bright light surrounded by four lights, then two lights, then as much as a dozen lights.  In addition to the changing shapes, the object's colors were cycling, from blue to white to yellow to red, although I wasn't so observant that I was catching a pattern.  Anyway, our neighbors started coming out, and we showed them where to look, passed the binoculars around we wanted as many people to witness this as possible.  We live not too far from the Daytona Beach airport, and as pl! anes, an d even a helicopter, passed overhead, we could tell just from the object's altitude that it wasn't a plane, at least not one that was coming to or leaving from the Daytona Airport.  Also, its pattern of movement was unlike anything any of us had ever seen.  Though it seemed like it was climbing in altitude, it was moving north, then south, in a snake-like pattern, and at several times it seemed to have dropped in altitude.  We asked around for a camera, but it seemed like nobody had a camera, or they weren't willing to take pictures, although I saw one of my downstairs neighbors taking snapshots. We phoned the local authorities, but they ignored the report.  We called the local newspaper, who told us to call the local authorities no help there either.  I even tried to find a local number for MUFON, to no avail. After about 2 hours, however, the object moved out of our field of vision, and we left it at that, with no explanation and nobody taking us seriously. ((NUFORC Note:  If, in fact, the object did move abruptly, it could not have been a celestial body.  However, we believe that the first possibility to be eliminated is the star, Sirius, in the southern sky.  It can be very bright, and it gives off a very brilliant chromatic display, as described in this report.  PD));29.2092113466332;-81.0318598503743

We had layed down on the blanket and stargazing when I spotted a shooting star.  This prompted curiosity and wonder therefore we both searched for possibly more shooting stars.  The shooting star that I saw had tail and was falling. The following sightings were completely different.  Four different lights were seen.  They had no tails like the shooting star. The direction of travel was more across the sky rahter than falling.  They were very high in the sky.  They looked like moving stars but the speed was very fast.  The first one was about twice as high as a normal jet but traveled across the sky about 10 times faster.  It was traveling South by South-East.  After crossing about 3/4 across the sky, it shot straight up into space.  The second one was about 5 minutes later traveling in the same direction as the first but a little more eastward.  It was about twice as high as the first.  This one's trajectory was not straight like the first.  It wavered back and forth as it traveled like an oscillation wave.  The third was even higher than the second one.  It too wavered.  The direction was not southward but due east.  This one traveled across the sky briefly and then shot out into space.  The fourth one was as high as the third and traveled in the same direction but continued straight and further across the sky before shooting onto space.  All four events occured within a time span of 20 minutes.;29.2092113466332;-81.0318598503743
