All of a sudden a large bright blue oval object no more than 300 feet away appears overhead of us, right into the clearing. It was a solid blue with an extremely bright glow. It moved in a swift figure eight pattern, paused for a half-second, then blasted off into the atmosphere at impossibly fast speed leaving no trail or glow behind it.  The best way to describe it is like in the movies when a ship blasts off into light speed, except this was an extremely bright blue object, which made no sound and left no trace of its existence behind. It was like nothing I've seen before and it what I saw doesn't even seem humanly possible.  This thing just took off and disappeared completely in less then a second. The whole event feels like a movie to me it was so surreal that I seriously could not believe my eyes, but it happened right in front of us and there was no possible way we could miss it, it was that close to us.;29.2092113466332;-81.0318598503743
