There was a black sort of platform in the sky at the bottom. It was the size of a round water tower's bowl. It seemed to glide in a very controlled maner as if on a magnetic field. It did not float nor look like a ballon. It was moving rather slow maybe 35 mph. It descended into the trees and went out of sight and seemed to be landing back in the trees about a half a mile away. I was driving to work at about 06:50 when I suddenly realized there was a florescent orange sphere low in the sky just ahead to the right. It seemed to glow from within. It made no sound. It was the size of a round water tower's bowl. At the bottom of the sphere was what looked like a black sort of platform. (Shape wise it looked like a basketball sitting ontop of a cassette box) Except the sphere was perfectly round and had sort of a mesmerizing presence to it,an aura . It sat directly on top of the rectangular shaped black object at the bottom, no straps or anything visible holding it down or attaching it. The black part was obscured by the tree tops. I was trying to make it out, although it was hard to see the black part, it seemed to have some part of it folded up under it at the bottom like legs or something. As I was traveling about 50 mph heading west it was moving north west out over the trees and slightly slower about 35mph. I was gaining on it. When I came to a stop light the car behind me pulled up along side me to turn right. The driver gave me a look like, you see that? And nodded towards it, just before he made his turn. The light turned green and then I was trying to get as close as I could trying to see it better. I kept saying what is that. It continued out over the trees and it seemed to glide as if it were being controlled some how and like it was riding on a magnetic field. It did not float like a ballon or appear to be a balloon. The road I was on began to bare to the left and south. As it did I was looking back over my right shoulder as I watched it go down into the trees about a half a mile away until I could no longer see it. I have never been able to forget seeing it.;29.2092113466332;-81.0318598503743

Hovered then turned south and moved away slowly then VERY fa My wife and I were at a hotel on the beach in Daytona Beach Florida on 7/20/16.  The hotel is on SR A1A about 2.0 miles south of US 92.  The time was 8:52 PM and it had just turned dark. We were sitting in the lawn area overlooking the ocean when we heard several people in a parking lot next to us to the south speaking loudly and pointing to a blinking object in the sky.  The object was about ½ mile south of our position, at about a 30–45 degree angle from our position, hovering over the beach at maybe 500’ (?).  From our position it looked small maybe about the size of a penny held at arm’s length.  It looked like a sphere with a ring around it, kind of like the planet Saturn.  It had a lot of lights on it many different colors.  Very bright white/silver, green maybe others, not sure.  The white/silver lights were constant and there were others blinking.  There was a violet one on the bottom that blinked a lot slower than the others, maybe once every second.  The others were faster. The object hovered for about a minute that we observed.  It then slowly turned west then south arcing slightly as it did.  It then headed south slowly then VERY quickly picked up speed and continued south down the beach until we lost sight of it. My wife noted there was a small plane approaching the object from the north and when the plane got really close, the object turned and quickly sped away.  As my wife said, It hauled butt. I had difficulty getting my phone camera to focus in the dark, but managed to snap one picture as soon as I saw it, then started video recording for 30 seconds or so.  I turned off video so I could snap another picture.  When I turned it off, the object had started its turn.  I turned the video back on until I lost sight of it. We are not sure what this was.  It was definitely not a plane or helicopter.  It couldn’t have been a drone as the drone would have to have been a big one, at least 10-15 feet in diameter.  No other logical explanation to what we saw.;29.2092113466332;-81.0318598503743
