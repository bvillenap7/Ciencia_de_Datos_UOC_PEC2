Stationary LIGHT and CLOUD observed in Daytona Beach;2001-06-25 21:35:00;Less than 2 minutes;Stationary LIGHT and CLOUD observed in Daytona Beach On June 25, 2001 a very clear night, not a cloud (rain) to be seen. My son and I were on our way home from work about 9:35pm, we both work in the rent to own industry. We were traveling south on Nova rd.,in Daytona Beach, Florida when all of a sudden my son, who was looking out the driver side window towards the east,said what the hell is THAT'? I began to look out the windshield in the direction that he was and what I saw is VERY DIFFICULT to describe. I saw what appeared to be a single cloud, almost due east from our position. At what is best described as the top of the cloud was a single bright white light. My first thought was that it was an aircraft of some sort with it's landing light on, only the light was NOT moving, IT was stationary and there were NO other lights. As I watched, the cloud began to loose it's density, almost like it was fading away and it seemed to diviide down the middle, the light however, remained at the top of this divison and continued to stay stationary. I took my eyes off of it to check out the road ahead of us as my son was focused on on the phenomena and was not entirely focused on the road. I did NOT see this next part, as it happened when I took my eyes off IT to examine the traffic ahead of us. He (my son) claims that a part of IT OR a second light seperated from it and fell towards the earth. The location of the light was due east of Daytona and would have been over the ocean. MY second thought was that it was a rocket that had been fired from the Cape, but the light was WHITE and NO orange to be seen, besides it was too far north by position to have come from the Cape (due east, NOT south east). It was about this time that the cloud disappeared completely along with the light itself. The moon at this time was located to the west of us an played NO part of what we saw. As i reflected back, IT reminded me of how the moon sometimes peeks through clouds with just partial light being seen, but the moon as stated was no where near the phenomena. In MY 47 years, I have NEVER seen anything such as this. I only hope I get the opportunity AGAIN sometime. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the cluster of reports that appear her for the evening of Monday, June 25, 2001, were caused by the launch of an ICBM by the U. S. Navy from the Kennedy Space Center at approximately 2115 hrs. (EDT).  We are grateful to the FAA Military Liason office in Jacksonville, FL the USAF 45th RANDS unit and the Naval Operations and Testing Unit (NOTU) for their assistance in our attempt to determine the cause of these reports.  A similar test was conducted by the USS West Virginia submarine off the east coast of Florida on March 07, 1998, which caused similar reports.  PD));29.2092113466332;-81.0318598503743
3 stationary, orange, rectangular lights evenly spaced due east off the fl coast.;2003-06-13 23:30:00;approx 1 min;3 stationary, orange, rectangular lights evenly spaced due east off the fl coast. I was walking south on the beach around 11:30 pm EST. After about 5 min we noticed some unusual lights over the ocean. Due east off Fl coast. In one's vision,you would have the beach in the lower vision and the upper the sky. Within the sky portion it was 1/3 of it above the horizon/beach. The lights would have appeared to be about an inch to two inches across together. The lights themselves were rectangular shaped and evenly spaced in a parallel line. The Light swere also orange in color and stationary. They disappeared all of a sudden like someone turned off a lightswitch. We observed them for about 15- 30 sec. For the most part it was a fairly clear night. There were some cirrus clouds over head and a bank of clouds off near the horizon but these lights were definately no where near clouds. It was a full moon so there was plenty of stuff visible. After the lights disappeared nothing could be seen where they once were. Just the sky.I believe it to be one craft if a UFO.;29.2092113466332;-81.0318598503743
Very bright silver object vanished from sight.;2016-07-19 20:15:00;10 seconds;I was driving in my car on A1A heading north in Daytona Beach, Florida, just prior to Granada blvd, at 8:15pm on 7-19-16, a little over one hour ago.  I looked up in the sky towards the west, approximately 40 degrees up and saw an extremely bright (silver) object about 1,000 ft up, just even with the first very dense layer of three small grey clouds.  The sky was very clear and my first thought is that it was an airplane reflecting the rays of the sun.   I kept my eye on the object for close to 10 seconds.  The sky was fairly clear in all directions and in the very far distance I could see airplanes flying the normal flight routes, very faint but visible airplanes.  After the ten second constant watch, the object vanished from sight.  I said to my wife, What the hell was that?'  I explained what I saw, we pulled over to the west of A1A so I could attempt to locate what I thought was an airplane and track the aircraft with my eye.  With a very clear 180 degree view of the western sky, I could not see nor could my wife see any aircraft heading west, north, east or south.  I was stationary at this location for 10 minutes looking for any signs of a possible aircraft.  Once again, the sky was very clear and cloud coverage was minimal.  This very bright silver object vanished from sight.  Nothing came through the three small grey clouds and I never saw it again;29.2092113466332;-81.0318598503743
