Very slow moving disk shaped craft heading towards lighthouse;2001-11-24 18:30:00;10 minutes;Very slow moving disk shaped craft heading towards lighthouse I was in car at around 6:30PM driving away from lighthouse.   Disk shaped craft flying just above trees about 75-100 feet away.   Craft was traveling just fast enough to keep up with the car going about 35mph.  Had a red light on each side and a blue light on top.  Was about 25 feet tall and about 15 feet high.;29.2092113466332;-81.0318598503743
craft over the beach during storm;2003-03-08 16:24:00;1 hour;craft over the beach during storm we were wathing a bunch of dolphins on the beach really close to shore and storm was sitting out inthe ocean and then lighthing struck about 20 feet behind a trawler fishing boat and this saucer shape kinda like a blimp was just floating out over the ocean. we thought it was a blimp at first but it never moved for an hour. airplanes normally fly right thru that area but they all went around that area the entire time it was out there. the beach patrol were clearing the beach too. the great thing is i have it on tape here and i have several copies out there that people have looked at in a media studio and they slowed it down and you can see the lights going around the craft. when you slow it down its quite visable.
