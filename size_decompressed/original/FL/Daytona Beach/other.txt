Blue Green fanning light covered entire night sky at the same time as power outage. Daytona summer 1989;1989-07-10 00:00:00;10 seconds or more;Blue Green fanning light covered entire night sky at the same time as power outage. Daytona summer 1989 Many details are fuzzy, I had to guess on time and date. It's been a long time but has been on my mind often since it occurred. During the summer of 1989 me and two of my friends were house sitting about a block away from Daytona Beach shore. The house was on a bit of a hill so more than just our street was visible. Late in the evening around midnight, all the lights went out. We rushed outside to see what was going on and noticed that all the lights in the neighborhood were out. I do not remember if there was a sound.  I remember this sighting coming from the non-water side of the city. This much I know for sure: In the horizon a giant blue-ish light shot from lower ground to miles in the sky. It then fanned out,  covering the entire sky in an incredible blue green display that lasted many seconds. It looked like a laser light show but the size and complexity was way too enormous to have been man made. Think of the movie Tron and a peacock tail. Both of my friends witnessed this. What we all agreed on instantly was it's size and that the power outage had to be related.  Moments after, the lights in the neighborhood began to come back on. We were absolutely blown away and speechless at what we saw. We called 911 to see if anyone had reported lights but I only remember getting no feedback from the operator. If you were outside that night in Daytona or any surrounding city you would have seen this. This is the first time I have reported it because it is so difficult to describe and at the time there was no internet or easily accessed reporting agency. I would really like to know if more people witnessed this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));29.2092113466332;-81.0318598503743
I saw it coming home one night the same day of a Shuttle launch in Daytona Beach,Fl.;1994-06-15 19:00:00;5min/less;I saw it coming home one night the same day of a Shuttle launch in Daytona Beach,Fl. I can't be sure at this moment if the year is correct.....but it is approx. right. It was however the same day of a Shuttle launch. I was on my way home from work driving home from Orange City on I-4 then I had just got off 4 on to I-95 south. I was looking ahead and saw light's about a mile in front of me. I always see planes because the airport is near by. This time the lights stayed stationary and I was thinking it was a chopper and it was a speed check. So I slowed down...... As I got closer it remained in it's position,to the point I was able to drive under it. I was able to see that it wasn't a chopper,there was no noise. It had a shape un-like any other that I have ever seen on TV. One that I can not describe  cleary in writing. But I could draw,which I have several time's. But I will try to do so here................. ---------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------- -------     -----------------      ----- -----      -----------------      ---- ---        --------------        --- ------------ ------- ----- This is the best that I can do.. This is not a disk shaped object.. In the center was a large black circular window...front and back.. on both ends..front and back smaller round dark black holes appeared to be about the size of tires. I believe on the back side....because of the direction it was moving...Where 5 strobe light..horozontally aligned on the upper part of the craft. It did not turn like a plane as it left me...which it did when I pulled over and got out of my car.It turned and went over to the north bound side of I-95 and headed north.then it was just gone.......I went home and told my family....and of course everyone just thought I was crazy.... And for the rest of the night and the next day I had a headache that wouldn't go away. I have just now in the last 6 months got a computer and was watching sightings and felt it was time to at least tell someone of my sighting and that there is another shaped craft that hasn't been shown yet.

Green object traveling North to South..ascending slightly upwards;2001-06-24 21:00:00;4 seconds;Green object traveling North to South..ascending slightly upwards While driving from North to South, I looked up and saw a ball of green light:not superbright,but very intense green,with a black/darkened middle. The green appeared more on the left and right sides of the ball as it ascended. It was traveling upward from North to South similar in speed to a shooting star as it heads downwards.Suddenly it was out of view because it ascended higher than I could see,being inside the car.At first I thought it may have been a reflection of the green traffic signal in my windsheild that I had just passed a few hundred feet behind me, but as i slowed down to look at it, it continued traveling at the same steady speed.

Glowing football shaped objects flying in straight line formation wing tip to wing tip over Daytona Beach, FL;2003-08-30 21:00:00;7 seconds;Glowing football shaped objects flying in straight line formation wing tip to wing tip over Daytona Beach, FL Sitting on the beach looking up at the stars. I saw what looked like 4 soft white light glowing football shaped objects flying in a perfectly straight line, wing tip to wing tip. They did not make any noise. There were traveling from west to east heading out over the Atlantic Ocean.  I didn't see them until they were directly overhead the beach. They appeared to be flying at about the same level as the lowest cloud tops. It was a mostly clear night, but a few puffy clouds were scattered about the sky. The moon was lighting up the beach.  I pointed them out to my wife and said, Look at those things flying in formation. She said, That's just a plane. Then I said, No. That's four separate objects flying in a line, wing tip to wing tip.  Then I watched as the left end object swung out wide from the formation and then shortly thereafter rejoined the formation exactly where it had been. The wing tips were exactly spaced between the objects and the speed was exactly the same for all of the objects. If those were airplanes I had never seen the bottom of airplanes glow in a soft white light and the shape was not an airplane shaped even a reflection off of an airplane would not look like that.  The flying objects stayed in a perfect line formation, wing tip to wing tip and suddenly faded into the blackness of space a few seconds after the left wing object rejoined the formation. I will never forget it. I had never seen anything like it. I am 51 years old. My wife was 45 years old at the time.  I will never forget the soft white glow crossing the dark sky directly overhead. I didn't get scared or anything. There were lots of people out on the beach that night. But I don't know if anyone else looked up to see what we saw. In case it was a plane, I kept listening for an engine noise, but never heard a thing.  I tried to call the talk show last night and talk about this, but could not get through. So now you have my true story! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));29.2092113466332;-81.0318598503743
Moving at constant speed, always upward in the same fashion as a falling and failing aircraft.;2008-05-26 20:00:00;6 minutes;Moving at constant speed, always upward in the same fashion as a falling and failing aircraft. The flying object was of dark color, most likely dark gray or black. Its shape was unknown to me and my mother. It was traveling northwest, originally coming from over the Atlantic Ocean. No lights whatsoever were visible on the object. It basically resembled a huge flat fish (ray) it had large and flat wings (one on each side) with very round and basic edges. As intriguing this object was, it still very much looked like an aircraft with two side wings, a distinctive front end and a back end including a wing. Certainly this object was large, but not incredibly massive â€“ probably a bit larger than a commercial, transatlantic plane. The wings were distinctive from the body which looked like a cylinder. Also the wings were attached about halfway on the body. The strangest part was the motion of this object. It moved upward by rotating on itself at a fairly slow and steady speed (about 5 sec. to rotate on itself). The object never appeared to fly downward and moved up at a slow rate (similar to a small commercial plane) - I and my mother were able to see it for many minutes from the front and back of our house. A fairly quite noise was possibly heard early when we first witnessed the object at low altitude and a certain aura/haze was present at times. Finally, a large cluster of clouds made the object disappear from our vision, but it disappeared steadily and not abruptly. Note that a commercial plane was flying in the opposite direction (Southeast) during the last minute of the sight at a very similar altitude. It could not have been further than 3 miles from it.
