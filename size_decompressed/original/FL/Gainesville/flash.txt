Multi colored flashing object that went from sitting perfectly still to flying away slowly;2005-03-02 23:26:00;8 minutes;Multi colored flashing object that went from sitting perfectly still to flying away slowly I live a few miles SW of the city limits of Gainesville on Archer road in a somewhat rural area. I was sitting on my back porch smoking a cigarette like I normally do and all of a sudden several dogs started howling like I've never heard before (just like a pack of wolves would howl) and cows started to moan/grunt loudly right after. This quickly caught my attention and I walked from my back porch a few steps into my back yard to see what could be going on. The streets were fine and there were no neighbors out at all.  I gazed up a bit and noticed this light flashing a few colors extremely fast in the distance which looked like a combination of mostly red and white with some possible blue/green colors. This light was sitting perfectly still flashing right above a tower. At first I thought it was some kind of new addition to the tower but couldn't make sense of that because the lights on the tower are solid white, do not blink, were much smaller and not as bright as this flashing light. I looked at this light for about 2 minutes while it just sat there and I tried to figure out what it was. All of a sudden it started to move slowy E almost towards the city and eventually disappeared from sight.  The object looked like a bright flashing star that a person would see when looking up at the stars at night, except this object was near the surface above a tower and flew away. At first I tried to pass it off as a helicopter but I couldn't figure out why a helicopter would sit idle in one spot and not move for a few mins and flash that many colors that rapid with no projected sound.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
Odd asteroid streak;2011-07-23 05:00:00;1 sec;odd asteroid streak Looking in SE sky, I observed what appeared to be small asteroid race across sky very bright streak.     Oddly, it appeared to hit something, stop, and sparklike streaks reflected backward.   This all happened in probably a 1/2 second.    I've observed 10 or so light streaks through the years which I assume are pea size asteroids burning up, but never did I see a sudden stop and sparklike streaks reflect backward.   No sound was heard.   There was a plane near this streak but did not seem to have any relation.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
Uniform flash of light seen inside, no source discovered.;2014-11-28 15:15:00;1 seconds;Uniform flash of light seen inside, no source discovered. My wife and I were in our condo tending to our son.  Both of were in separate locations inside of the dwelling.  I was watching college football, while she was in one of the bedrooms folding clothes.  The event was a flash, similar to what is seen when a light bulb burns out, except it was uniform.  Both of us saw a flash which didn't seem to come from anywhere inside the house, and didn't seem to come from a uniform area of outside.  It looked to me like it came from the south side, while to her it looked like it came from the north side of the house.  Went outside to identify anything that could have made the uniform flash, and could find nothing.  We have trees in our rear lot, and a brick wall in the front, but the flash seemed to be uniform, unobstructed by these objects.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
I saw what appeared to be an exploding satellite @ ~9:10 PM March 24, 2016;2016-03-24 21:10:00;<1 second;I saw what appeared to be an exploding satellite @ ~9:10 PM March 24, 2016 At about 9:10PM March 24, 2016, I saw a momentary explosion high in the atmosphere that lasted less than a second.  There was no sound.  It looked like a firework explosion at its largest size about 1/3 the size of my pinky finger nail held at arm's length.  (~1/3 cm)  My impression is that of an exploding satellite.  The “shrapnel” was red in color and was either glowing from an explosion, or reflecting red from the sun, that had set earlier.  It did not streak through the sky rather, it just exploded.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
