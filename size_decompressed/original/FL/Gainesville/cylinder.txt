Rectangular/cylindrical large object seen in the western sky;2019-11-25 18:20:00;15 minutes;Rectangular/cylindrical large object seen in the western sky As i was coming home in the NW area of Gainesville.....I saw a HUGE object...either rectangle or cylinder...it was quite some distance away...in the evening sky...west...next to a normal star/planet. I was motionless...twinkling and VERY bright.Almost looked like it was oscillating. The size in comparison to the star was HUGE! My husband and I watched it for about 15 min....went inside ....came back out about 10 min later...and t was gone! NOWHERE to be found. The star had remained in the same position..but this object was gone.  There were also 6-8 white lights all over the sky.Lots of helicopters flying around outside now.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
