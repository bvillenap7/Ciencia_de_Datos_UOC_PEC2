A bright orange ball of light hovering approximately 500 feet above the tree line with no sound coming from it.;1993-01-20 18:50:00;15 minutes;A bright orange ball of light hovering approximately 500 feet above the tree line with no sound coming from it. I saw this bright orange ball of light hovering about 500 feet above the treeline 3 times during a two week period in the month of January 1993. The first time I saw it I was driving home from work aroung 6:30 pm EST. It had been dark for half an hour. I was traveling north on 441 about 7 miles north of Gainesville on my way home. I then noticed this orange ball of light hovering above the treeline. It just sat there. It glowed but didn't move. At first I thought maybe it was a heicopter searching for something, but the more I looked at it I realized it couldn't be a helicopter because the light wasn't a searchlight. It didn't reflect a beam of light: it just glowed. It couldn't have been a plane or helicopter because there were no other lights on it and no strobes. There are some towers in this area but it wasn't them because I could see them off in the distance and besides they having flashing red lights on them. I didn't stop to watch further because I had to get home. It was still in the same place as I watched from my rear view mirror until I was too far away from it to see it anymore. The second time I saw it was about a week later with my wife in the car as well. It was in almost the same spot that I saw it in the last time, but I think it was further north along the road. She didn't want me to stop and look at it so we continued on home. I saw it again about a week after that. So this time I stopped my car on the edge of the road to check it out. Unfortunately because of the height of the trees next to the road, it blocked my view of the orange ball of light. There was no sound from that spot in the sky. I thought surely I would hear an engine of some kind, but I didn't. When I got backl on the road I could still see it above the trees until I was too far away to see it anymore. I never reported this to anyone because of the skepticism most authorities have towards this type of siuation. I have driven this stretch of everyday for the last 7 years and I have seen nothing like that before or since.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
Unexplained light/sound phenomenon;2001-03-24 02:00:00;10-15 seconds;Unexplained light/sound phenomenon My husband and I and our three kids had decided to do a campout in our back yard by putting blankets, etc. on the trampoline and sleeping under the stars since it was such a clear night.  At 2:00 am we were both awakened by a loud humming noise accompanied by a pulsating light that filled the entire night sky (not a beam) but seemed to emanate from a circular/semi-circular object as far away as any other star in the sky. The humming/light would get louder/brighter and then dim.  This happened three times in a period of 10-15 seconds.  There was absolutely no alcohol/drugs involved in this sighting and this is our first experience ever with this sort of phenomena.  Any explanation or insight would be appreciated.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
Stars flashing and moving;2003-12-15 19:00:00;3 hours;Stars flashing and moving Was out in the country taking the trash out for my Grandmother and I noticed a really bright star(brightest I've seen). It was in the west part of the sky at around 19:00. Thought it must have been a planet or something to be so big and bright. It didn't move any.  Then a few minutes later I saw a dim star directly above me that was moving. Nothing special but one constant light(like a star) moving across the sky from south to north. Not a plane because it had no strobes. Looked like a star moving at about the speed a plane would move at except it looked to be at an extreme altitute.  Then when I was leaving at 21:30 I looked and both of the earlier ones were gone. I happened to look around again and saw something odd in the east part of the sky. Another big star except this one looked like it was rotating and the light was changing color. It did not move but it was flashing from white to blue to green and to red. It looked like a star that was going super nova or something because of all the colors. I also noticed about 5 planes in the sky, 2 of which were heading directly at it. Then as I drove home I kept looking for it then when I got home it looked like it had moved farther east because it was smaller but still flashing.  Can't say any of it was a UFO for sure. Could of been something with the atmosphere or increased light pulution as I got to my house. Either way it was cool to watch and not something normal. There were no sounds.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
Stationary piercing bright light over Hunter's Crossing Publix drifted over Devil's Millhopper.;2004-09-15 22:30:00;8 minutes;Stationary piercing bright light over Hunter's Crossing Publix drifted over Devil's Millhopper. On September 15, 2004 at around 10:30 pm my friend was traveling west on Millhopper Road. There was no moon. It was a clear night right after hurricane Frances. She stopped at the stop light on Millhopper and 43rd street. She saw one piercing bright light about the size of a double pencil eraser(at arm's length) above the Publix store. It began to move at a steady speed in a straight line going NW. It stopped above the trees at the Devil's Millhopper non-public entrance. She lost sight at this point because she had to continue in traffic. She estimated the speed of the light at about 20 mph. The height of the object was about two pine trees tall. The observation lasted about 8 minutes. She saw no other colored or non-colored lights and no shape or shadow behind the light. She heard no noise, felt no breeze, and no one else on the road seemed to notice it.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES;2004-12-29 21:10:00;5MINS;I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES IT WAS A STRANGE ILLUMINATION OF LIGHT, BY IT BEING NIGHT TIME OUTSIDE IT WAS KIND OF HARD TO DETERMINE THE DISTANCE.BUT THE LIGHT EMMITED WAS NOT PROJECTED IN ANY DIRECTION IT WAS BRIGHT ENOUGH TO BE SEEN BUT NO FLICKERING ALMOST LIKE A GLOW. IT MOVED SLOWER THAN A LOW FLYING PLANE, IT MOVED AS IF IT WAS HOVERING SLOWLY FORWARD IT PASSED THROUGH THE CLOUDS . IT DIDN'T MAKE A SOUND AS IT ALMOST GOT OVERHEAD IT PASSED INTO ANOTHER CLOUD AND NEVER EMERGED OUT THE OTHER SIDE AS IT DID BEFORE. ABOUT 5 TO 7 MINS LATER WE OBSERVED SEVERAL SMALL PLANES RESEMBLING JETS. MAKING MULTIPLE PASSES OVERHEAD IN THE AREA WHERE WE LAST SAW THE OBJECT. THIS CONTINUED FOR ABOUT 30 TO 45 MINS THEN THE SKYS WERE CLEAR AGAIN.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
Darker Bright Blue Light Went Faster Than a Jet Fighter In Gainesville, FL;2011-11-14 19:15:00;2 Seconds;Darker Bright Blue Light Went Faster Than a Jet Fighter In Gainesville, FL Today I was running with my friend along NW 34th Street during the evening.  While we were talking and his head was turned toward me I saw what appeared to be a darker bright, well lit, and solid light.   The color was a mix between turquoise and navy blue.  I couldn't tell very well since it went buy so fast, but I saw a dark grayish hue around the light, maybe it was a disk, but I'm not sure.   The object was maybe give or take 2000ft above and went buy faster than a jet fighter. It made absolutely no noise whatsoever.   I saw this light go by in two seconds, then it went over the treeline.  And when I ran past the treeline, it was nowhere to be seen.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
Bright light in western sky.  Not a planet.  Could not be identified by smartphone app.;2012-03-18 23:00:00;30 min;Bright light in western sky.  Not a planet.  Could not be identified by smartphone app. March 18th 10 to 11 pm Eastern time I saw a bright orange light low in the western sky.  It wasn't Venus or Jupiter because it was the wrong color and they had already set.  It wasn't Mars because I could see Mars overhead at that time.  I thought perhaps it was an airplane headlight, but I never saw any blinking lights on it and it's only movement was a slow downward descent like it was any other star or planet that was setting.  It got slowly dimmer the lower in the sky it got.  A smartphone with an app that identifies constellations and such could not identify it.  According to the smartphone app it was just northeast of the constellation Aries. Van Johnson Gainesville, FL;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
