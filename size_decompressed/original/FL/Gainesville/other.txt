This all happened when I was in Job Corps at the Gainesville Job Corps Center. It was dark, and me and one of my good friends had to retrieve something from the woods surrounding the Center (of course, we weren't allowed in the woods, but we went anyway). We were walking towards where we had our campsite and my friend stopped me suddenly. Check it out! Two werewolf (?) type beings just floated across! He shouted. I was looking down at the time, so I cannot acknowledge if he indeed saw this. We continued on when we spotted a UFO on the ground, barely discernable. The shape of it was roughly that of a saucer. It was doing nothing, just sitting there, silent. Strangely, no lights or anything else that could provide illumination was present on, around, or near it. It was more like we could see it since our eyes were adjusted to the dark (Since we didn't really want to get caught, we had no flashlights). We advanced slowly, hoping to get a closer look at it. No such luck. We stopped in our tracks when we realized it had disappeared! We glanced at each other, and moved on. We got close to where our material was when something compelled me to get out of there and FAST. I took off running and my friend was not too close behind. As I was running, I looked over my shoulder and spotted a tall, dark, large-headed being with a dark robe on and it's hands folded in front of it. I did not stop to talk to it or get any closer. I just wanted out of there. That's about it with this one.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618

So it starts when I go home from school.  I walk to my car.  Feel a bit off.  Saw a normal-looking helicopter flying off to the North-East.  On my drive, this is what I saw. It was some type of aircraft. It was white, and was hovering around. No trail, no noise. Just kind of slightly descending for a bit.  Then in another direction.  The movements definitely seemed deliberate, and from the photos I've seen they look nothing like a weather balloon. Normally, I'd probably brush that off.  But here's the issue.  I cannot describe the shape in one word.  It had at least 3-4 wings which were different sized spikes, long, and jagged.  It looked incredibly bizarre.  Nothing like anything I've seen before in my life, especially in the damn sky. I saw it about 4 times within 5 minutes.  Each time, it was going in a totally different direction.  The last time I saw it, it was very translucent, and it was glowing a pinkish-reddish hue.  It really wasn't that high up in the sky it was high, but low enough that I was able to be pretty damn sure of what I was looking at. After that, I had about 10 more minutes of driving.  I saw that same helicopter that I saw earlier going NE, except this time it was going South to South West.  Then a minute later I noticed a big black helicopter.  It looked like one some type of police force or military would use.  It went very fast, I lost sight of it within 10-15 seconds. The final part was when I got home, I parked outside. Looked up in the sky again hoping I'd see the original object I saw.  There were about 3-4 very tiny planes.  Just white with wings, kind of like a drone considering how small they were.  I don't know what to make of that. I did take videos, but my damn camera made it very blurry cell-phone cameras really are not able to produce clear images of objects 100-500 feet away.  They just look mostly like blurry spherical things in the sky for the most part. Can anyone explain what in the world that was?  Has anyone seen anything similar?  Where should I take this from now?;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618

Coming downward until it turned to a teardrop with a fire tail.  Then it stopped and started to pulsate a very bright light.  After it dropped for a second it then hovered.  After 10 to 15 pulsates it disappeared.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
