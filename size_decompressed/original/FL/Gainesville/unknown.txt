A ball of light comming twords me in a haze of fog.;2004-10-15 00:00:00;15 minutes;A ball of light comming twords me in a haze of fog. My friends and i were at what they call the rock quarry in Gainesville around midnight a couple of years ago. we had climbed up this big hill and were sitting on top of it talking. After about an hour it started to get very cold so we decided to leave. Off in the distance, out of nowhere, there was this creeping fog with a bright circular light shining in the middle of it. We stopped to see what it was, if we could. The fog was comming right twords us, and so was the light. Eventhough it was covered in a haze of fog you could tell this was no plane, it was getting closer and brighter. It was very big and almost right on top of us when we all got scared and ran. To this day i can't tell the exact shape of it, at first it seemed circular but as it got closer it was just a very bright light.

Basically same thing as what was seen in Winter Park, but on New Years day in Gainesville, Fl. Came from NW and went S near N Main St.;2008-01-01 17:00:00;1 minute;Basically same thing as what was seen in Winter Park, but on New Years day in Gainesville, Fl. Came from NW and went S near N Main St. From what I could tell it was large and very dark was flying low. It is hard to describe a shape as it is sort of abstract. It's odd because everyone was able to get a good look at it and not really describe it. There were no lights and it was flying slow.  Three other people were with me to confirm. I found this previous sighting below that was very much the same:   NUFORC Home Page Web Report Indexes: by Event Date | by Location | by Shape | by Posting Date  National UFO Reporting Center Sighting Report  Occurred : 11/27/2007 07:34 (Entered as : 11/27/07 07:34)  Reported: 11/27/2007 5:52:47 AM 05:52  Posted: 11/28/2007  Location: Winter Park, FL  Shape: Unknown  Duration:2-4 minutes  Strange Dark Object over Winter Park  I was standing by Lake Virginia at Dinky Dock Park this morning just after 7:30am. This is a daily ritual for me on the weekdays before I start work in the area. The sun had risen, and there were a few light clouds. There was no wind. The area is in the flight path of jets landing at Orlando International Airport, which is approximately 10 miles to the south. I was staring out over the lake when I looked up and noticed a black form flying towards the lake from the west. At first I thought it was a large bird such as a vulture or eagle circling over the lake. The object was dark, big, silent, and was not traveling at a high rate of speed. As I examined it more closely, I could see that it was not a bird. The object descended, and for a moment, I thought it could be someone parachuting into town, but I didn't see any evidence of a person beneath the object. It stopped descending and began to slowly fly to the northeast, towards the Casselberry area. Despite the object being very dark, the rear of the object reflected in the newly risen sun as it flew out of sight. There are some cypress trees by the lake, which obscured my view of the object as it flew away. When it was shining in the sun, it appeared to be spherical - I'm not sure if the object actually changed shape as I watched it, or if I had misjudged its shape when I first noticed it. A few strange things about the object: It seemed to be flying low. It was difficult to determine its exact shape. It was completely silent. It seemed big, but I was unable to determine its size without a nearby sufficient frame of reference. The moon was still visible in the sky - if I had to compare it to the moon, I'd say that it wasn't big enough to have obscured the moon had it flown over it. Also, it seemed to appear from the west - it was just there over the lake somewhat suddenly, but it's possible that nearby trees obscured it from my view. My only thoughts on what it might have been is a balloon, but not a hot-air balloon. It seemed to be following a definite flight path - not randomly being carried by air currents and ascending and descending. Also, the shape seemed to be off. I'm wondering if anyone else saw this object today. It flew towards a very busy road during morning rush hour traffic - Highway 436 in Winter Park - when I lost sight of it.
