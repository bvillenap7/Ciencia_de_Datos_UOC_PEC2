Large egg shaped object motionless in sky;2002-12-04 16:00:00;30-40 secs;Large egg shaped object motionless in sky I was driving down the 43rd street extension to go food shopping when I saw a very large,dark, egg shaped (eliptical) object with a shiny spot on each side (lights?). It was not moving at all, not high like an airplane, not a helicopter, not microwave dish.  I was trying to make sense of it because it didn't move.  After 30-40 seconds, I rounded a curve with trees which blocked my view and when I passed the curve the object was gone- no where to be seen. This frightened me very much and I called 911 to see if anyone else had seen this.  I gave my name and cell phone number.  About 45 minutes later my two children started yelling that there was a rainbow.  I looked out the car window and to the left of the sun (quite a way) there was a light shining in the sky with a vertical rainbow in front of it.  I don't know if this had anything to do with the other object I saw.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
Illuminating Orange-Red glow, beautiful that flew so low.;2013-03-29 21:00:00;5-6 minutes;Illuminating Orange-Red glow, beautiful that flew so low. Hi, my name is ((name deleted)) I’m from Gainesville, Florida.  On 3/29/2013 approximately between 8:45pm and 9:00pm I and five others witness UFO’s in the beautiful night sky which allowed a clear view of what we were watching.  As me my girlfriend Holly and friend Rich finished assembling of our unborn child’s crib.   All three of us went outside to say goodbye to Rich, as Rich stepped down the stairs and off the stairway leading to the apartment he noticed something in the sky that was unfamiliar. So he called me off the porch down the steps to see as well.   As my friend Rich fumbled with his phone to video this amazing event, I step off the porch solid onto the pavement soon after Rich, I immediately looked straight up into the sky and the first thing that I saw was about four glowing, almost egg oval, orange red objects  in the sky above all four Illuminating, three in a row and one on the side accelerating quicker than the others moving towards the front of th! e others and eventually 5 or 6 seconds later to lead what it appeared to some sort of straight line formation.  They also made no noise at all like it was a defining moment in life were everything goes silent until that special event is over. A second after witnessing that I my girlfriend and Rich are all now on the pavement observing this breathtaking and phenomenal event witnessing at least 6 more UFO’S behind  the first group in a less organized way than the first four.  After two minutes into observation of this event, my girlfriend called her mother, sister and brother in-law witness this event as well.  As we all observed the UFO’s in the night sky for about 2 ½ to three minutes Rich finally got the video up and started recording the night sky while the UFO’s passed through at a very slow pace almost as the speed of a blimp illuminating an orange-red fire color as they go.  These UFO’s had a very low altitude &ltas if I can reach out and touch one&gt they were moving g! eometrically perfect traveling SE. As these UFO’s slowly moved! about w e all talked and enjoyed the beauty of or neighbors getting out for an ole stroll in the park –it was beautiful and enlightening. When the UFO’s started disappearing out of sight their altitude went higher from a straight line and then a swooping upwards motion off the straight line altitude up and out of sight like they went through some kind of door or something because they vanished into thin air. This whole event was about 5 to 6 minutes from initial sight of the UFO’s, taking place in SE Gainesville approximately between 8:45pm and 9:05pm on 3/29/2013.   I hope that someone can explain this event, because this event was way out of the ordinary.  Thank you for taking time out to view this report hoping that it’ll be helpful and enlightening to some, thanks once again. Sincerely, ((name and e-address deleted));29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
