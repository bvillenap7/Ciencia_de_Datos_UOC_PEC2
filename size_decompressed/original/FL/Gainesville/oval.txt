UFO in the sky of University of Florida;2003-03-22 22:00:00;15 seconds;UFO in the sky of University of Florida Date/Time:     03/22/2003 around 22:00  Location:   Southwest of Lake Alice, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, U.S.A.  Observers:   Me, ((name deleted)) & my friend, ((name deleted)):  In Saturday evening around 9:00pm, March 22, 2003, my friend ((deleted)) and I went out to have a walk along the Southwest of Lake Alice. Because the sky was very clear in that evening and there were only a few lights around, it was perfect for watching the stars.  Around 10:00pm, I happened to look into the sky, there was suddenly an ellipse-shaped dim object flying from Northwest to Southeast with very high speed along an almost straight line. I immediately told my friend ((name deleted)), so she saw the same thing flied to and disappeared in the further Southeast too. The total time for the objectâ€™s appearance was about 5 seconds.  Only two or three seconds later, when we were still looking at the sky and wondering what we had seen, another ellipse-shaped dim object was seen flying from West to East with about the same speed and same straight line, which made an angle of 25-30 degree across the line the first one made. Both of us saw both of the objects clearly and surely.  Although they looked gray, bright, outstanding in the dark sky, there were no flashes from these two objects, and they seemed much higher and flied much faster than normal planes. So they should not be planes or helicopters. We suspected that these objects were UFOs based on our analysis. If anyone happened to see the same thing on the same date, we are very interested in knowing the details in order to confirm our thoughts and make to report to pertinent Agency.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618

Multiple sightings by multiple whitnesses, unknown objects moving in strange ways, speeds, directions.;2010-09-09 22:00:00;2+ hrs;Multiple sightings by multiple whitnesses, unknown objects moving in strange ways, speeds, directions. Location = 29.36n 82.22w ,  Objects were seen in the southern sky between 180 & 210 deg. Originally sighted one of the objects following and overtaking a commercial aircraft then coming to a sudden stop, then descending several thousand feet in altitude before losing sight of it.  Then sighted two objects spiraling double helix style as they descended several thousand feet, then departing in separate directions.  Over the next few hours we saw several dozen objects, but couldn't be sure they were separate objects or the same ones.  All moved in different directions, altitudes, and speeds.  Having spent many years in the military, I estimated the distance to be from 8 to 15 miles distant, none had ACL beacons or navigation lights.   Objects were weakly lighted until moving at high speeds, estimated to be several thousand mile per hour.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
2nd night watching the objects, approximate time viewed 15-20 minutes.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible stars??  PD));2010-09-09 22:00:00;45 min;2nd night watching the objects, approximate time viewed 15-20 minutes Sitghting location = 29.36 n  82.22 w  180 to 210 deg compass heading from GPS local. Estimated distance to objects 2 miles.  Objects moving in all directions, mostly up and down, elevation 30 deg.  Objects were low intensity glowing orbs, with no apparent pattern to the movements.  Lighting looked like corona discharge with no anti collision lights, or beacons.  Distance seemed much closer with no atmospheric haze visible.   We will endeavor to get a closer look if they return tomorrow night.  We plan to try photographing and possible video footage if possible.   4 witnesses all sober professional electronic technicians.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618

6 reddish orange oval shaped lights hovering in the western sky seen for about 2-4 minutes.;2017-11-24 20:14:00;2-4 minutes;6 reddish orange oval shaped lights hovering in the western sky seen for about 2-4 minutes 2 of us were walking and playing with our dogs, when we both suddenly noticed these lights in the western sky.  They were reddish orange, and very bright.  They were way above the tree line in an open area above the golf course.   We took pictures with our phones, after a few seconds of watching, and called out to neighbors to come see.   The lights suddenly went out as if they were just turned off.  One of the lights seemed to have a slight spin to it.  They appeared to be like a constellation of stars, except they were oval. I am a 72 year old grandmother, college educated and active in my community.  My neighbor is a 27 year old student who lives at home with his mother and young sister.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
Shadow of 3 aircrafts observed flying between clouds and the sun;2021-08-09 13:00:00;less than a minute;Shadow of 3 aircrafts observed flying between clouds and the sun While staring up at the sky I observed a fast round shaped aircraft moving quickly with another similar shaped aircraft right behind it following and then a third joining from out of formation. No direct sight of the aircrafts, shadows were the detection while the aircrafts moved in between the sun and the clouds above. Aircrafts were flying West to East. Aircrafts moved much faster than a plane at the height they were observed.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
