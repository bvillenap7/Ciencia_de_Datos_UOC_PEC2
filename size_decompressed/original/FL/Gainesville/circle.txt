They showed us around the ship,and the greys told us that they were coming.  In our dream the outside was round with blue and gold lights. The inside had gold lights, and we both remember seeing two examination tables on our right side.  The next morning which was a Monday the 14. A lady had called into a radio station that we were listening to which was 98.5 KTK fm, and she said that there was a ufo spotted in Gainesville, Florida.  She said the ship had blue and gold lights on the outside of the ship.  It was the same one that we dreamed about.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
Numerous lighted objects , identical to each other.maintaining distance and position , whose light patterns changed simultaneously.;2008-04-29 20:00:00;4 hrs.;Numerous lighted objects , identical to each other.maintaining distance and position , whose light patterns changed simultaneously. Last night at approx. 9:00 pm  I looked up and saw (3) objects that looked identical to each other staying stationary in a triangle formation . They all displayed what appeared to be 4 lights forming a diamond pattern with a 5th light in the back. When I looked around the sky I noticed several more identical objects literally all over the sky. I called a friend who lives on the outskirts  of town outside the range of the ambient city  light and he said he saw  “ dozens of them all over the sky .”  My girlfriend got her camera w/ a telephoto lens and when we looked at one of these objects it appeared to be a circle with a geometrically placed display of tightly grouped lights. We looked at another of these objects and saw the same display of lights. However the light display changed from many lights tightly grouped to just six large lights now occupying the same space . We looked at the other object to compare them again and this objects light display had changed to the six light array as well. The objects did not move and maintained their distance from each other.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
Two quick moving lights in the sky sighted in Gainesville, FL;2008-06-30 05:45:00;3 min;Two quick moving lights in the sky sighted in Gainesville, FL I was driving to a friend's house around 5:45 AM when I saw two circle lights in the sky that were moving fairly quick.  They were both next to each other at first, then they started to move apart in different directions.  I know for sure that they weren't airplanes because neither had any flashing lights and airplanes don't move that quick in the sky.  I lost sighting as I turned the corner to my friend's house and as I pulled up in the drive way, I got out of the car to see which direction they went and sure enough, I caught one of them and got a better look at it as it was flying across the sky. There was no noise as it flew across the sky.  As I was staring at the moving light in the sky, my friend came out of the house and saw it too.  He then, told me so that what ever that was, it wasn't an airplane.  It was really spooky.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
Yellowish/orange sphere, extremely fast flew from horizon to horizon in seconds;2011-11-25 23:30:00;Couple Seconds;Yellowish/orange sphere, extremely fast flew from horizon to horizon in seconds I was walking my dog alone at night, facing west.  For some reason I felt compelled to look up at a star behind me, to the southeast.  As I was doing so, I saw the UFO come from the eastern horizon and zoom past to the southwestern horizon.  It was too low to be a plane, but too high to have been anything else.  It was incredibly fast. It crossed from horizon to horizon in the fraction of seconds.  It was a very bright color, orange and yellow, and it did have a tail, like a comet would have, but could not have been a comet.  There are no reports of comet sightings in my area. I suppose scientists might call it a fireball, but it did not appear to be on fire.  As it passed it didn't make a single sound, very eerie. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
15 disc shaped, silent, slow moving , orange lighted craft slowly changing formation was seen by 10 witnesses 12/31/2011 11:45pm;2011-12-31 23:45:00;5 minutes;15 disc shaped, silent, slow moving , orange lighted craft slowly changing formation was seen by 10 witnesses 12/31/2011 11:45pm At approxmetly 23:45 on New Years Eve I was out side looking at the sky, becouse it was a beautiful clear eavning,when i saw at tree top level a bright orange light. I thought it was a plane comming at a weird angle , I live about 5 miles from airport,  and i noticed that the light was to bright for a plane.It was higher than the trees but at that time it looked about tree top level.I say about a thousand feet it turned out to be. No sound. As it passed over the tree I noticed another orange light then another until i could see about 10. They all were in a 2 by 2 one on top of each other seperated by maybe 200ft in formation. I ran to get the others inside home and all saw. At that time more just kept on coming by until they were 15. They seperated and changened formation . They all ended up in a line. Must have been going  5 miles an hour. They were moving slow. They never spead up. They just kept moving forward until we could not see them becouse of trees.! I took about 7 pictures and was able to zoom up on some. If you want to see them get my email. They look disc shape when zoomed up surounded by lights. 3 adults age 40,46,49, seven teenagers sophmores and juniors in high school witnessed. 40 year old(x-ray tech) 46 year old(jeweler) 49 year old (thearapist).;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
A ball of light, almost hovering at times, in the sky;2014-10-25 04:30:00;1 hour;A ball of light, almost hovering at times, in the sky At approximately 0430 hours, I witnessed a bright ball ago light that moved in elevation and did radial maneuvers beyond any known U.S. technology. It lasted for about an hour but did not disappear, but simply left my viewing range. Perhaps others would have seen it longer. I am not one to take someone's word for anything.   I was in the U.S. Army.  My m.o.s. was 14 echo (patriot missile launching) so I am familiar with aerial identification. I can safely say this was not of man.  The size was hard to judge however because of the nature of the craft.  I would estimate it at about ten meters in diameter.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
