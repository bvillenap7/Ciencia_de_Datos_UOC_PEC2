Viewed a delta shaped craft in the SE sky traveling south, craft made no noise and flew smoothly before banking and disappearing;1998-11-18 00:00:00;30 sec - 1 min;Viewed a delta shaped craft in the SE sky traveling south, craft made no noise and flew smoothly before banking and disappearing On Nov 18, 1998 my best friend and I were observing the Leonid meteor shower.  At aprox 24:00 movement in the SE sky caught my attention and I observed a grouping of three lighter area of color moving south.  These areas weren't lights, merely lighter color reflecting ground lights.  In between these areas there were no stars visible and you could just make out the shape of the craft  At this point my friend also observed the object. The craft moved fairly quickly with no noise continuing south until it banked to the west and disappeared from sight.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
Short sighting of UFO;2005-06-10 14:00:00;less than 1min;Short sighting of UFO I was out at the pool, reading, when my glance happen to to catch a movement to the upper right of my line of sight. I turned my head and saw an aircraft and, wanted to see exactly what kind of aircraft it was, I turned on my side to get a better view. It was flying near east and the sky was cloudless for the most part. I found the flight path to be very odd so I began to think it was a bird but i realized that it was much too big. Its path was straight, although seeming to have some angualar velocity that was up. The most striking thing about the object that I noticed was the smoothness of the flight. Although one would not consider other aircraft to be unsmooth, this had a striking quality to it. It was triangular, exact detial I could not see. Its color was dark, although I could not tell exactly. It moved quickly from what I could tell given its relative size and height. It moved toward the tree line, although never reaching it, disappearing within an instance into the cloudness area of the sky. All of this occured in about a minute.

Slow moving low flying black triangle with dim star-like lights;2005-10-20 20:14:00;~1 min;Slow moving low flying black triangle with dim star-like lights I stepped out of my apartment to the sidewalk to get into my car and a movement overhead caught my eye.  It was hard to make out but the motion of the object was obvious- It was very slow moving and either very very low overhead- as an approaching plane- or it was absolutely enormous and flying at a normal altitude.  At first when I recognized the dark triangular shape, I thought perhaps it was a stealth bomber, but realized it wasnt possible as it was so low, moving so slowly, and did not make a sound.  Two guys my age (mid-20's) walked past me, and I asked them if they had seen that but neither had a clue to what I was referring.  Everything echos in my apt complex, so it must have been silent or the guys would have heard it.  It was a perfectly clear night with the stars shining. The moon was just rising as sunset was only about an hour prior to the event. (maybe to help the ship blend in they chose that time to be fly so low, since the background sky wouldnt be as bright from the then waning moon)  The object which was barely noticeable, except that it seemes the object had either very dim lights around its edges- roughly as bright as the dimmest stars you can see- or it distorted the background skyscape to conceal itself.   It moved due East and I watched it until it passed over the roof of the adjacent apartment building.  I actually followed it as best I could in my car since I was originally leaving my apartment to go to my destination which was also due East- but no luck- nearly got in an accident trying to look for it though!  Incidently, I have a BS in psychology, and am pretty even keeled, but when I saw this I was afraid I was having a psychotic break from reality brought about by stress, but I knew I had seen SOMETHING, even though I wasn't sure that it could be a UFO- the only other theory I came up with is that it was a hangglider- but there aren't any open fields around here to land- its pretty heavily developed.   I must say though, getting to read everyone else's claims, especially those that are similar to mine made me feel a little more credible- funny thing is I've always believed we were not alone, but I couldn't believe I had actually seen one.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
April 4, 2008, 10:14 pm, triangular formation of white lights forming one solid object over night sky in Gainesville, FL.;2008-04-04 22:14:00;a few seconds;April 4, 2008, 10:14 pm, triangular formation of white lights forming one solid object over night sky in Gainesville, FL. Friday, April 4, 2008, Gainesville, Florida, 10:14 pm  I was standing in a line on the Reitz Union North Lawn of the University of Florida with my younger brother.  We were looking into the sky at stars, small aircraft, etc.  I looked ESE and saw, just above a tree line, four small white lights in a triangular pattern (three on the left side, one completing the back right corner) travelling approximately south.  I said to my brother, What the heck is that? and pointed to the lights.  I had initially thought it was a formation of planes, but it couldn’t have been besides the fact that there were no red, blue, or any blinking lights, it became apparent that we were looking at one solid object.  I only realized this as the triangular object began to move behind trees.  My brother was standing to my left and had a better vantage point, and he saw it dip down, come back up, and then fade out.  The whole incident lasted a few seconds.  A few minutes later, a helicopter started circling around that area it’s difficult to determine distances, but I would say that the helicopter was probably closer to us than the object had been, and a little more south.  It had a bright search beam on and searched for about a half-hour.  We saw quite a few planes and a bird in flight while standing there, so we could distinguish between those and whatever it was we saw.  As much as we searched the sky, we never saw it again.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618

((HOAX??))  Camouflaged UFO;2011-01-03 19:30:00;:30;Camouflaged UFO Craft appeared to come into the atmosphere camouflaged with the night sky.  But, it did make a faint sound, as though something large was pushing air out of its flight path. Not sure what it was, but it was something we've never seen before.  Triangle shaped, with very soft glow, almost bluish tinted lights under neath. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Three lights in the sky that didn't look like plane;2013-09-09 21:00:00;1 minute;Three lights in the sky that didn't look like plane On 09/09/2013 I was walking my dog.  As usual, I looked up at the sky to look for constellations.  I was out particularly longer today because I was so transfixed on Venus which was on the west horizon.  As any star watcher knows, the longer you look up at the sky, the more stars you can focus on.   So, I was able to make out many constellations. Eventually, I turned my attention to the eastern side of the sky as it moved north to south.  I spotted a satellite a little before 9 pm and tracked it as it moved across the sky.  I eventually lost it behind a building.  Hoping to see it again, I moved to a clearer area, but unfortunately, I couldn’t find it again.  I scanned the sky again and saw, at approximately 9pm, heading in a southern direction, a very bright light.  It was just as bright as Venus to the west.   However, I knew that there was no star that bright on the eastern part of the sky, so I gazed at it a little longer.  Because of a tree right under it, I was able! to notice that this ‘star’ was moving.  I was a little stunned, but then I told myself that it was probably a plane. So I watched it as it moved towards the south.  Eventually, the brightness faded and I saw that this bright light was made up of three smaller lights.  The more it moved to the south, the less bright it became and the more I could make out all three lights.  There were two in the front and then one a little, but not by much, dimmer light.  They formed a triangle, with the base being the front and the apex forming the tail.  I thought that maybe it was a plane, but I stared and stared and tried to make out any beacons, or blinking, lights, but never saw any.  If I know anything from watching the sky is that planes always have blinking lights.  So I followed this light, which seemed to be travelling in a linear path, but eventually I lost it behind the same building.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618

((HOAX??))  White triangle headed northwest at incredible speed till out of eyesight.;2016-04-01 21:00:00;90 seconds;White triangle headed northwest at incredible speed till out of eyesight. I felt like i wanted to look at the sky, so I went outside to smoke.  i saw what i thought was a very large white bird flying really high up thru some faint clouds. I thought about what kinda bird it could be and why would it be so high while i watched it.  It moved in a straight line at a steady pace. As it cleared the clouds i saw that it was not a bird, but a white triangle with no noticable lights.  it looked slightly blurry,solid white. I was still convinced it was probably a large bird like maybe a giant crane and that i just couldnt see its wings move and that why it looked triangular. I watched it travel westward until it did an amazing series of loops and zigzags at an incredible speed, then it took off northwest over the archer road area so fast that it virtually disappeared out of eye sight.  it moved so fast it seemed like it left a tracer or trail of itself for a split second. I estimate that i watched it for about a minuite and a half before it zoomed off. i would still believe that it was a really big white bird but there is no way any bird could move that fast or make such servere turns and loops. Im not prone to making up stories. Im not addicted to drugs. Im not on medications that make me see things.Im pretty sceptical of these kinds of stories without some kind of picture or video. I do follow ufo sightings regularly but i dont recall a white triangle being a thing people see often. I appreciate any feedback into this that anyone sees fit.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
