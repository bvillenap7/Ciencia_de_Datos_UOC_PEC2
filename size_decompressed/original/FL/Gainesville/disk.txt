Strange disk shaped object witnessed in Flordia.;2005-02-04 17:00:00;30 mins;Strange disk shaped object witnessed in Flordia. I was traveling south on I-75 south of gainesville when I noticed a silver object hovering in the distance.  It first looked like a plane with its landing lights on but it wasnt moving at all.  I watched it for about 5 mins while driving and I looked down at my speed and it was gone.  I traveled about 30 miles farther and exited on S.R.40 at silver springs Flordia and went west.  As I approched 80th street I saw it again. I was going to a friends house and when I got out of the car I showed the object to him.  We watched it for about a  few moments and it vanished into thin air.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
