We were going out for the night and walked out the front door to see a glowing yellow ball off in the distance just above the tree line.  It made no sound and it was moving slowly.  We got in our truck and drove out to the two-lane highway. On the highway we saw a light again off to the left.  We pulled over to watch the light, which was now an orange color.  The area where the light was located is a large area of vacant land with an old barn. My boyfriend got out of the truck and I stayed inside looking out the window. We watched and it looked like it was at the level of a streetlight though we know there were no streetlights there.  It must have been a few minutes while it hovered and then all of a sudden it shot straight up in the air moving incredibly fast.  We watched it go up and then the glowing light expanded and then it was gone.  When we got to the place we were headed, I called somebody related to air traffic/air force to ask them if there was anything they were flying.  They said no, but that it might have been a weather balloon.  It seemed like that might account for the floating glowing light we saw along the tree line but didn’t seem plausible for the way it stayed still and then shot up in the air.  I had never seen something move so fast. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
Ball of bright orange fire moving low across night sky;2013-06-07 20:23:00;10 seconds;Ball of bright orange fire moving low across night sky At 9:23 pm EST,  June 7, 2013, my husband and I were sitting on our patio in Gainesville, FL, looking at the stars.  It was a fairly clear night.  Suddenly we both saw a bright orange object move low across the sky, from SW to NE.  It was flying lower than a plane or helicopter.  It seemed like an active flame (as in a fireplace) contained in some sort of transparent round, or cylindrical container.  The fire was extremely bright orange in color.  My first thought was that it was some sort of roman candle, but there was no sound at all, and the object kept moving across, not down.  There was no tail.  We guess it was moving 35-40 miles per hour, and seemed to be about 200-300 feet above us.  The size, to our eyes seemed to be about about 1 foot x 2.5 feet in size, at the distance from which we saw it.  It was low enough that I worried it would set fire to one of the tall pines. After about 7-10 seconds, it went behind trees so we couldn’t see it any more.  Neither my husband nor I have ever seen anything like this.  I might describe it as a sort of flaming orange Japanese lantern, except the orange flame was intensely bright, and like fire, not an electric light.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618

It changed color and direction. My girlfriend and I had just stepped out of my apartment to go out shopping.  My apartment faces East and as soon as I stepped out, I noticed a point of light in the distance, with an illuminated tail behind it, moving very slowly.  At first I thought it might be a flying lantern or a fire kite, but that did not explain the trail, which looked somewhat like a bolide except that it was taking so long to dissipate, and so long to move. It appeared to change color after the trail disappeared, going from orange for the first couple minutes, to whitish with no tail, to dimming until we lost sight. I could not get a picture because of the security light in my complex, which would easily bleach out the image.  I could very easily indicate the precise area of sky we were observing, since we were only a few feet from my front door. Neither of us was drinking or under any other influence.  I'm sure there is a simple explanation for what we saw, but we do not know what that could be.;29.6527104513063;-82.3629524940618
