It was merely a light at first, but it was as bright as Jupiter. It didn't seem to move much. We watched it and after a few minutes, it became 3 lights, which seemed to slowly fade away. As it became harder to see, it still didn't move much. Minutes later, we thought we could still see something. Probably sunlit, whatever it was just baffled us.;30.2108;-84.3205
