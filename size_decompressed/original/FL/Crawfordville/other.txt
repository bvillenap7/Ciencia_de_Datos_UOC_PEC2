Hot air ballon shaped object;2012-07-13 22:00:00;2 minutes;Hot air ballon shaped object I walked outside to make sure the heater for the animal pen was plugged in and I noticed through a space in the trees a little below the tree line, a box shaped object to my south east.  It looked like a hot air balloon with a really wide base.  It had a row of red blinking lights that would blink on and off in a rotating motion and would change direction and did not seem to follow any perticular pattern.  What alarmed me was the fact it wasn't moving and was just hovering in one spot.   I watched it for a minute or so and then I went and got my husband.  We watched the object for about another 20 seconds and then it just shot through the air leaving a streak of light like a shooting star does. We bought our house 2 years and this is our second experience.  Several months ago my husband stepped out back which faces north east and saw a very bright light that was so bright it hurt to look at it and that it was a disc shaped object, not sure how to judge its size.  It was right above the tree line several acres back on our property.  It scared him so he went back inside for a few minutes.  He went back outside a few minutes later so try to get a better look at it and it was gone.;30.2108;-84.3205
