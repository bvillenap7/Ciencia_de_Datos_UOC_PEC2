UFO's over Boca Raton, Florida.;2007-10-19 18:30:00;5 minutes;UFO's over Boca Raton Florida My girlfriend and I were driving home and we saw a lightning storm ahead of us. I pulled out my digital canon camera to take some photos of the lightning up ahead. When  looking threw the camera I saw a light glowing in the distance. I started to zoom in on it and discovered that it was something unusual. It appeared to be a large oval shaped ufo and a small little one below the big one in the far distance. The objects were not visible with the naked eye, but the camera was able to see it. It could not have been a default with the camera because the object only appeared in one spot in the sky and no where else. as you can see on the photos the object doesn't appear in the same position every time.  Therefore, it could not have been something on the lens.;26.3680098712447;-80.1384974248927
Nine orange oval objects flying above Boca Raton.;2014-02-22 19:15:00;10 minutes;Nine orange oval objects flying above Boca Raton At approximately 7:15 this evening our neighbor came to our home banging on the door telling us to come outside and see something.  She ran down to the property line where it was clear of trees and we had a clear view of the sky.   It was then that we looked to the sky and saw 9 oval shaped, orange objects heading NW one after another.  Occasionally, they flickered and seemed to hover.   They were moving at 40 mph and lower than airplanes normally fly above our area.  It was astounding.  The direction and speed of the wind is South @ 8 MPH.   When they were out of sight from our home we jumped in the car and traveled north on Highway 441 where we were then able to catch sight of two of the craft, but when they reached a certain spot they both vanished.   We include an iron worker, a secretary, an office manager and a middle school teen.   This was so stunning that we called the Director of this website, Mr. Davenport, to report this sighting.   We are certain others witnessed! this event as well and we hope they too will report it.;26.3680098712447;-80.1384974248927
