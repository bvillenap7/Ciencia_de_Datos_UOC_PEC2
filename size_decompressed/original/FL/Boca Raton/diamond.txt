A diamond shaped object emitting a flame headed West towards the horizon in Boca Raton FL.;2011-06-19 20:45:00;90 seconds;A diamond shaped object emitting a flame headed West towards the horizon in Boca Raton FL. A diamond shaped object that had a trail of fire emitting from the center was spotted by a couple of coworkers and myself heading West in the evening.  The object made no sound and seemed to be decending possibly due to the fire or damage to the craft.  It was very difficult to estimate the size of the object due to there being nothing else in the sky except clouds to compare to. We are located on the edge of the Everglades in Florida so it headed towards a sparce and unpopulated area.  There appeared to be no light coming from the object other than the flame.  It was only due to the flame that we could make out the diamond silhouette of the object.;26.3680098712447;-80.1384974248927
