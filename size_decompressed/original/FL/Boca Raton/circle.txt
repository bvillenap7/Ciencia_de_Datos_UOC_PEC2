Then they stop.  I had to drop of some documents at the west side of the city, coming back over the Saw Grass express way (1) Hr. later, again in the same spot, but only one light, same spot, same direction, no noise, very slowly moving, I will estimate  about 2000 feet up.

It then got closer and larger very quickly.  It then stopped again for roughly 5 seconds.  Then the object rose up in the sky and got very small, stopped for a second or two. There was absolutely no sound or flashing lights.  It got very big and slowly dropped down appearing to land a few streets away. I waited for several minutes to see if it was going to re-appear but it did not.  It was very strange looking with an ominous glow.

It was fairly close, too,) Solid Orange ball of light flying southeast (opposite direction from airplane approaching Boca airport) Altitude approx 2,000 FT.  (It seemed to be a couple miles away from my vantage point)  Object was silent and appeared to be travelling exact opposite as a nearby plane which had the usual flashing multi-color lights.  I didn't see any stars in sky due to cloudcover. After 30 seconds it just dissappeared completely and suddenly I took photo and it appears as solid perfect round light in photo. Size was about 1/5 of what a full moon is.  It wasn't extremely bright, and didn't flash or change speed...just glided above tree line for what looked like a mile then vanished (as if turned off by a light switch);26.3680098712447;-80.1384974248927
