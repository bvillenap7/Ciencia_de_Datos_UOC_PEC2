Strange Streak Across Sky December 7, 2004  Picture located on NASA’s ‘Astronomy Picture of the Day’ December 7, 2004  On the evening;2004-12-07 23:00:00;2 hours;Strange Streak Across Sky December 7, 2004  Picture located on NASA’s ‘Astronomy Picture of the Day’ December 7, 2004  On the evening of December 6, 2004, about 11:00 p.m., my neighbors and I witness a strange streak that covered the whole sky.  It seemed that the streak was located high in the sky stretching from South to North covering the entire sky.  The streak was not a cloud or made by a jet plane.  The next day, NASA published a picture on the internet, as stated above.  One can see what the streak looked like on the NASA’s website’s  picture.  NASA stated several days later that a bug had walked across the camera lens.  If one looks at the picture, one can see that the streak starts at one end of the sky and finishes exactly at the horizon. This streak was not made by a bug.  I do not have any idea what the streak was or what it was made of.  I have called NASA and the Miami Transit Planetarium to report it.  No comment was made.;26.3680098712447;-80.1384974248927
glowing green circle floating, fast moving above Boca Raton, FL;2009-07-06 21:00:00;4 Hours;glowing green circle floating, fast moving above Boca Raton, FL Around 9 P.M. a friend called me to come outside.  There was a green light in the sky, but it was too close to be a star.  It was moving side-to-side and hovering, like nothing I have ever seen before.  I jumped in my car and drove to its location.  It was a green glowing circle shaped object, about 100ft above us, floating.  We watched and took pictures as more bystanders showed up.  It slowly started to move NE.  Then all of a sudden it shot 30 ft east in seconds.  It was unbelievable.  We watched it move half a block east then come to a stop.  A police officer eventually showed up and asked us what we were doing.  He saw the object also and had no idea what it was.  Around this time we saw a white wire sticking out of both sides of this UFO.  I have no pictures of it though.  It eventually went very high in the sky and slowly faded away.  It was the strangest thing I have ever seen.;26.3680098712447;-80.1384974248927
2 Orange (shaped like 9) hovering over sandalfoot both made loop de loops and in less than a second they were 25 miles away;2014-11-08 18:30:00;10 minutes;2 Orange (shaped like &quot9&quot) hovering over sandalfoot both made loop de loops and in less than a second they were 25 miles away I live on the southwest corner of Palmetto and Lyons road. Tonight around 6:30 I was looking southwest and saw two orange lights in the sky hovering.  They were there for about 5 minutes then both did a type of loop de loop and in under a second they seemed to shoot SSW. approximately 25 miles away.   1-2 minutes later it came right back to the original place that I saw it first.  Next it shot the same direction away what looked like 100 miles away.  2 minutes later they were gone.   They were definitely not airplanes, helicopters, blimp, etc.   About 3 minutes after they left a military helicopter flew right over me in the direction that the 2 objects went.;26.3680098712447;-80.1384974248927
