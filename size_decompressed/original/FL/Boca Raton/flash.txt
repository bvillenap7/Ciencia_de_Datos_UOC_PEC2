He gets up every night between 4:30 to 5:30 and goes on the computer in the kitchen. I told him to come back to bed it was about 05:10 AM. After calling him numerous times he finally came to bed in our bedroom which is in the rear of the house. As he laid down a bright flash of light came in the window. It was a bright light on the side of the house strobing then went out. We both looked out the window and did not see anything. We have a privacy fence that you cannot see through as well as a wall that is the side of the neighbor's house, we live in zero lot line houses, and our yard which is fenced in so no light from the streets can get in. I stayed awake for about 1/2 hour and watched out my window for anything strange. About 6:00 it flashed again. The light was not in the rear only on the side. We went outside to look and found nothing. We went in the front of the house and looked in the sky and saw nothing. I would like to note that about 2 weeks before in the evening about 4:00 am I saw small lights in the yard around the pool and palm trees. We have about 150 palm trees surrounding the pool. The foilage is dense around the fence and pool.I seen 2 lights about the size of a small flashlight in the trees about 3 feet from the ground. Another was in the top of the palm on the opposite side of the yard. I woke up my husband and said look at these lights in the yard. They flashed like they were flying like large bugs across the rear yard. The bugs would have to be about a foot long to produce a light of that size so I assumed it was not bugs. We watched them and one flew over by the window that we were looking out of and went straight up in the sky over the house. The other two were still in the bushes . He decided to go outside on the screen patio, our pool is not screened in, to see up close. He was 3 feet from the bushes outside the screen patio and wanted to go out. I advised him not to because maybe something would zap him up if he approched it. He called to the lights and they went around the back of the bushes and both went up into the air. We told a couple of people but not many because most peoople do nto believe you when you hear strange stories.  That is why when we seen the flashing light we said I guess it is the aliens again. We have not idea what this is but it sure likes our yard!!I scares us both.;26.3680098712447;-80.1384974248927

Massive red glow in the eastern sky occurring twice within two or three minutes, each lasting 3 seconds.;2013-10-31 05:45:00;3 seconds;Massive red glow in the eastern sky occurring twice within two or three minutes, each lasting 3 seconds. While driving east on Yamato Road very early, the eastern sky lit up with a red glow which lasted for three seconds.   It was followed two minutes later by a second red glow which lasted again for about three seconds.   Could find no evidence of wreckage or explosion or fire to explain the massive size and color of the light.;26.3680098712447;-80.1384974248927
