PD));2011-07-21 23:00:00;2 Hours;Cylinder-shaped object, seems to be spinning, gives off red, green and white lights.   Viewed from West Boca, observed over the Glades. We observed from our back yard somewhere off over the Everglades, viewing from West Boca, a cylinder shaped object that seemed to be rotating.   We noticed red, green, and white lights, and sometimes blinking.  It seemed to move back and forth sometimes, but never strayed far from its main location.  Did not observe it leaving, but when I came back it was not able to be seen.  The event lasted two hours.  We have observed the same thing, generally at night, maybe twice before.  All in the last 2 months. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??  PD));26.3680098712447;-80.1384974248927
6 red fire objects in the sky.;2014-09-09 20:10:00;5 minutes;6 red fire objects in the sky. Walking to my car in a parking lot, I noticed something big and red in the sky.  I thought it must be Mars.   Then I noticed another one to the SE of the first.  They were both traveling West.   I turned around to see a much closer one coming from the East traveling West.  This was much closer and I could see that the bottom was fire and above the fire there was some sort of white vertical sleeve.   Nobody in the crowd that had formed was able to figure out what it was.  We initially thought hot air balloons but it was night and the fire was constant.   Three more followed.  All looked the same and all travelled West.  It was cloudy and they all disappeared into the clouds.  None of us knew what we had seen.;26.3680098712447;-80.1384974248927
