I am a local and reputable attorney in my area, Palm Beach County, Florida. I've never seen anything like this. I was walking out of my car to enter my condo.  I looked up and saw a huge light in the sky.  It was hard to not notice.  It was moving horizontal, from North to South along the coast line.  The cigar shaped object was followed by 2 small objects.  The lead, cigar shaped object projected a huge cone shaped light from it's front side, bright like a spotlight.  The two smaller objects followed.  The lead object would lead bright, luminescing cloud like plumes that could not be mistaken for all of the naturally occuring clouds in the skyline.   The objects moved slowly, hovered, moved forward, and turned from south to east over the ocean and disappeared.  Once the object turned east to the ocean, the huge light it emitted disappeared and the objects faded off.  The object was high in the sky, and could not be mistaken for any plane.  I saw planes that! night, and they were much smaller, much, much smaller and the planes moved in a much more predictable manner.   I am upset with the local news reports, stating it was from a airforce rocket that was launched.  A rocket only moves upwards and quickly. The rocket was launched 30 minutes before my sighting.  Local radio, 850 AM radio, played the actual, verbal launch transmissions, clearly ruling out the rocket.  Further, the many 911 calls are being withheld from public request, which is unusual and against the freedom of information act.  I did not take a camera phone picture because the objects were too far away, but the footage from the local newspaper is fairly accurate, but not as clear as I saw it.  http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/broward/fort-lauderdale/fl-ufo-sighting-20130808,0,4711750.story;26.3680098712447;-80.1384974248927
