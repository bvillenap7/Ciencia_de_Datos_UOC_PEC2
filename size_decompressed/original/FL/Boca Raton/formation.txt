Soundless rectangular object with many light glides quickly across the night sky;2008-12-27 22:00:00;7-10 seconds;Soundless rectangular object with many light glides quickly across the night sky In the air directly above, moving from west to east, what looked to me like one rectangular shaped object with a row of 4 lights on each side glided through the sky quickly with no noise at all.  Before disapearring from sight, the two rows of 4 lights split, with one row turning north and the other row moving south.  The event lasted 7 to 10 seconds.  It was witnessed by me and a friend laying on a blanket looking up at the sky.;26.3680098712447;-80.1384974248927
5 Red circles hovering, looked light lining of a structure....until I realized there is no structure.;2013-10-05 21:00:00;5 minutes;5 Red circles hovering, Looked light lining of a structure....until I realized there is no structure. I was exiting the store and thought these were the outter red lights to a structure, water tower, building or other until I realized there is no structure in my neighborhood that consists of red lights.  They were sitting above horizon and not shy at all.  Lights were red.  This was the most here welcoming I have ever witnessed in my life.   This was in Boca Raton, FL,   Here is a link to a Youtube Video I found that is exactly what I saw.  Mine were way brighter.
