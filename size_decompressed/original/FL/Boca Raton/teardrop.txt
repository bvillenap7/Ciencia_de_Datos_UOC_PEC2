A slight shadow effect where the windshield should be. The craft approached from due east just above the Boca inlet at appox. 100 m.p.h.(estimated) and as it approached it performed a complete 360 degree barrel roll within 50', giving my other witness and I complete and unobsturctive view of the top of the craft. Close enough to notice no rivets were used to hold the plates together. One aspect that should be noted  (there was no sound) a third member of our party was at least 10 to 15 feet closer up the sand dunes than ((initials of witness #2 deleted)) and I were, and yet he saw nor heard anything! Roll your lips into a big O and blow  sounds just like a U.F.O. to me! I only had time to get off one statement to them and I said, Thats not nice! Oh yea , I pointed a finger at them , you guess which one. ((initials of witness deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));26.3680098712447;-80.1384974248927
Orange and grey pine cone shaped orb sighted while driving east in Boca Raton, Fl., between 8:15 and 8:30 PM.;2012-08-07 20:20:00;3 minutes;Orange and grey pine cone shaped orb sighted while driving east in Boca Raton, Fl., between 8:15 and 8:30 PM. Was in my car driving East on Yamato Rd, had to stop for a light and saw something from side of my rt eye, looked up to see a bright orange colored light out my windshield.   Watched as long as I could but had to move on due to traffic flow at which time it passed my field of vision.  The light was steady burn, not pulse and was a deep orange at the bottom and a dark grey at the top, it was tilted with dark grey to the upper left and orange to the lower rt.  The orange was larger than the grey. It had a somewhat triangular shape but rounded at the corners, like a fat pine cone.  Was disapointed that I was not able to stop to watch but my passenger was afraid to stop and traffic was flowing.  The object was slowly traveling in a westerly direction.;26.3680098712447;-80.1384974248927
