UFO over Boca Raton, FL?;2000-06-01 22:30:00;10 minutes;UFO over Boca Raton, FL? I don't really blieve in aliens or anything making it to earth, but me and a friend saw the strangest craft one night. We were driving north on I-95 back home at about 10pm when we saw this ball of orange light in the northwest. I was the first to point it out, as I was the passenger. It looked like a meteor or something. I was a little freaked out at first -- I kept having visions like in the movies, where the meteor crashes to Earth and all hell breaks loose. But the 'ball' never hit. It sort of faded out and disappeared at first. My friend saw it too and decied to pull over to safely view whatever it was. A couple seconds later it was hovered almost directly over us it was pretty large...larger than a helicopter and had no visible wings, more like a long triangle. There were no flashing beacons or standard collision lights except 3 dim white lights on the bottom. It hovered for about 5 minutes before this huge (about 1/3 the size of the craft it self) bright blue afterburn came out the back and it took off. In a couple of seconds it sped off towards the northeast and was gone for good. What was so strange was that there didn't seem to be much sound when the craft took off I was expecting a sonic boom at the least, but nothing. My friend and I could not believe what we had just seen. About a half hour later in a supermarket, a woman overheard us talking about the event we had seen and chimed in that her son had seen the same thing at a soccer game.

Each triangle craft looked like there 3 balls all attached together to from a single craft in the shape of a triangle. Each craft  was luminus like you could see through them but you  could'nt. Both passed directly under the moon making it easy to see that they were not weather balloons. There was no sound as they passed. No flashing lights could be seen and they both had a very soft silver/blue glow as they glided along. During this time there was and  aircraft could be seen off to the right of them...You could see its flashing lights as it seemed to at first be moving in the same direction then went vered off to the my right from the ground. Moving quickly from the back yard through the house, grabing husband and son...the only thing left in the sky to see what the plane. Both craft had vanished.;26.3680098712447;-80.1384974248927
It wasn't that late at night, the air craft was extremly big and had some unique colors coming from it.;2005-12-12 00:00:00;4 minutes;It wasn't that late at night, the air craft was extremly big and had some unique colors coming from it. The object that we saw looked like a triange, but the back of it was curved in.  The lights i remember seeing from it were yellow and green.  My parents though it had been a satelite, being launched to space.  Trust me, this was no satelite.  At the time of the incident, I had a weird jitery feeling.  I was very confused, and felt very weird.  The craft made no sounds at all, even though it flew about 250 feet over our heads.;26.3680098712447;-80.1384974248927
Translucent white/green glowing triangle.;2009-09-08 21:10:00;3-5 seconds;Translucent white/green glowing triangle. It was approximately 9:10pm EST. Boca Raton, FL. I was in my backyard on my cell phone when I happened to look up. It looked like a very large low flying craft triangular in shape. All sides were rounded with what looked like one oval shaped light on each corner. No bright lights or flashing lights. The entire craft including the oval spheres on each corner were whitish in color but seemed to be emitting a mellow green glow similar to that of which you might see with a glow in the dark plastic toy and It was completely silent. It all happened so fast that by the time I looked up again to try understand what I thought I was seeing it was already heading over my roof and out of my eye sight which left me wondering if I had really seen anything at all but I felt compelled to post here incase there are any other similar sightings in the area.

Silent, single gold light flying very quickly. Changes direction several times.;2013-01-26 03:35:00;10 seconds;Silent, single gold light flying very quickly. Changes direction several times. Leaving the lab late at FAU, as I was walking to the parking lot with a friend I noticed a dim gold/beige light flying in a southwest direction.  I pointed it out to my friend walking beside me, he noted aloud that it was accelerating.  We stopped in our tracks and just stared up at it.  A few seconds pass then it quickly starts flying in the opposite direction and then jerks to the west, then circles and starts flying east.  I took out my camera since this was my third UFO sighting and wanted evidence this time.  However, the view became obstructed by the top of a palm tree and we never saw it again.  There is a small airport very nearby, however I have never seen an aircraft move with such freedom.  In fact, I just viewed the Boca Raton Airport webtrak flight tracker from 3:17am-3:40am.  Not any kind of aircraft arrived, departed, flew over or nearby the airport according to several of their radars.  Im planning on contacted them to inquirer about what I saw.  It's hard t! o say what it was exactly but I have a tinge whatever it was did not mean to be seen.;26.3680098712447;-80.1384974248927
