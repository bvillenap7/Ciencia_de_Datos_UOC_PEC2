At first i did'nt pay too much attention i just watched, i live 5 miles from Nasa and very close to an airforce base so it isnt too unusual to see F16s flying around especially when we get so close to a shuttle launch. The movement of the lights was strange, at first they were parallel then vertical, i know there are fantastic aircraft manouvers but this happened within a second and i heard no noise at all. The lights approached me and i just watched in amazement, I wasnt scared at all. The craft was roughly 2000ft above my head and i could see it was no aircraft i had ever seen (i used to be a flight attendant) it was not a perfect chevron but not a perfect triangle either. it had three extremely bright white lights one in the middle and at each side, there was a larger red light in the rear center of the craft the underneath was like a gride or grate, it felt like it was watching me as i was watching it very weird. The craft after hovering over me for at least 50 seconds which seemed like a lifetime excelarated which sounded like a huge vacuum cleaner not an aircraft and then slowly moved over the house. I ran out to the front of the house grabbing the phone to call the police to see if anybody else was reporting seeing the same thing, and watched the craft settle like a star as beams of light danced around it zipping back and forth around the sky.;28.3695667189955;-80.7175572998433
