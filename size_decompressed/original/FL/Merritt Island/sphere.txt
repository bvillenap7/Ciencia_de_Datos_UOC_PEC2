UFO sighting near Kennedy Space Center 2000;2000-03-15 03:00:00;5 minutes;UFO sighting near Kennedy Space Center 2000 This happened in Merritt Island, FL about 5 - 10 miles south of Kennedy Space Center.  I was driving about 50 mph North bound between Grant Rd. and Hall Rd. (though closer to Grant Rd) when a brightly lit craft that seemed spherical hoovered closely parallel to my 1991 Mitzubishi Mighty Max Pickup.  The craft emitted a low hum which I could feel throughout my body.  Every hair on my body was raised, though I suspect from fear.  The light completely filled the cab of my truck but i was able to see out my windshield fine.  I was unable to get more than a fleeting glance because I was affraid and unable to look at it more than once. I would slam on the brakes hoping the craft would pass but it would stay perfectly parallel to me.  I sped up to approx 90 mph which it also matched, perfectly.  I was driving in the left lane north bound on SR3 which is bordered by a grass island then the south bound lanes.  The craft was above the grass island.  It then went staight up and disappeared. I slowed down and looked around for a helicoptor, police car, riding lawn mower anything that could make what I saw NOT a UFO.  I saw nothing.  I was a skeptic until that morning.  I cannot say whether it was man made or alien being that I live within 10 miles of our access to space. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));28.3695667189955;-80.7175572998433
Metallic grayish ball.;2012-04-20 15:00:00;5+ minutes;Metallic grayish  ball I saw a small ball that was white or silver coming towards me and my mother in the sky.  I lived by a few car dealerships so I thought it might have been a balloon.  When I was sure it wasn't a balloon, I thought it might me a training helicopter.  We have a school nearby.   When it was overhead I could tell it was neither.  It was a small sphere and the color was a metallic greyish color.  I could tell that it was flying with a purpose and not just floating.  I felt like whatever it was, it was surveying or looking at the ground.   There is NASA and Patrick Air Force Base nearby so I wasn't sure if it from those locations.  I had a strong feeling at the time and still do, that it was not manmade.;28.3695667189955;-80.7175572998433
Nine orange glowing orbs following same general path from east to west.;2016-03-04 19:00:00;1.5 minutes;Nine orange glowing orbs following same general path from east to west. On 3/4/2016, we were stopped at a traffic light at Merritt Ave. and S.R.520. From the east, we spotted 8 or 9 bright orange glowing orbs slowly heading southwest. They appeared to be closer to the ground in the east and gradually ascended as disappeared as they traveled southwest. There orbs did not follow in a line or make up a larger shape. They were independent from another, but followed more or less a similar path. This is the third time we have seen these within a year. The first time was in Cocoa Beach, and the second from the oceanside, going over PAFB. There were only 3 or 4 the previous times.  Same bright orange glowing orbs.;28.3695667189955;-80.7175572998433
