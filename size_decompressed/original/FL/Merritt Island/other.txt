Moving stars underneath the lunar eclipse;2003-11-08 20:00:00;15+ minutes;Moving stars underneath the lunar eclipse I wasn't going to report this.. because it may have been Air Force Procedures, I noticed a couple of other reports of the same thing, so I felt obliged to report it.  I went outside to watch the Lunar eclipse at about either that night, and noticed as I was facing the eastern sky, watching the moon do it's thing, that there was a white light under it, looked exactly like a star, moving slowly southward, and it seemed to be gaining altitude.  I paid no mind, thinking that it was an Air Force plane, since I live near a base, going for a landing of some sort.  Then after a couple of minutes or so, either it, or one just like it, was moving northward, but it was losing altitude at a gradual pace.  After it disappeared behind some tall, thin trees across the street from my home, I waited for it to come out again, but it didn't.  Then I saw a light off to my far left (NorthEastward) that seemed to be moving, but it was much slower than the first one (two?).  I kept watching, and it didn't seem to be moving at all after a minute or two (maybe it was twinling?), but the light that disappeared behind the trees never reappeared either.  The mosquitos loved me that night, so I bid the moon and the mysterious stars goodnight and went inside.;28.3695667189955;-80.7175572998433
