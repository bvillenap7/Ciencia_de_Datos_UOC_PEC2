Orange ball hovering over a river south of the Space Center in Florida;2006-12-31 22:00:00;1-2  minutes;Orange ball hovering over a river south of the Space Center in Florida My wife and I were traveling East on State Road #528 and got off at the Banana River Drive exit in central Florida when as we reached the bottom of the ramp we saw what looked like a round ball of orange fire. It was around 10 pm under clear skies in late December of 2006. We were almost home from an evening of visiting our son and his family when, as we reached the bottom of the off ramp, straight ahead of us in the air we spotted a ball of orange flame hovering in place in the sky.  I told my wife to 'look at that helicopter up there.' I said that it had to be on fire and she agreed. It was dark outside but a clear night and unless the ‘helicopter’ was completely painted in florescent orange paint with spotlights shining all around it, the craft we saw had to be engulfed in flames. We fully expected it to suddenly fall to the ground, but to our amazement, it instead just quietly hovered in place until finally it made a lateral move, exactly as a helicopter might do.  But where are the blinking lights I said? Any flying craft would have to have some sort of blinking lights on it so as to alert others that it's there, no doubt it's an FAA law. But there were no lights, only that glowing orange ball. It was no more than a 1/4 mile away from us, hovering over the Banana River, roughly about 150 feet in the air. Cars began to back up behind us so we left the scene.  Was it a UFO? I believe so. I thought so then and I think so now.  A sighting by a retired Air Force Colonel in Arkansas not long after our sighting was similar in appearance, as he was fortunate enough to get a picture of the orange ball like object.  For background, my wife and I are both about 50 years old and live near the Atlantic Ocean about fifteen miles South of the Kennedy Space Center where I work.  Neither of us drink or do drugs, nor do we, as a general rule, look for or care about the subject of UFO's. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

On 10/28/09 a UFO hovering over state road 3 in merritt island florida emitting no sound or vibration except a bright amber fire light.;2009-10-28 21:05:00;5 minutes;On 10/28/09 a UFO hovering over state road 3 in merritt island florida emitting no sound or vibration except a bright amber fire light. On 10/28/2009 at 21:05 hours located on state road 3 in merritt island florida we witnessed a circular shaped object emitting a very bright amber fire colored light hovering over state road 3 just above the tree top line. The object hovered for approxiamtely 5 minutes while we stood there staring at it. I snapped 2 shots from my camera phone and the object then took off at a 90 degree angle straight up the sky towards space. We stood there watching it as it left with extreme speed not capable of any airplane or jet. The object never emitted any sound or vibration. I researched online before thinking about reporting this incident.;28.3695667189955;-80.7175572998433
Orange white orbs moving silent.;2013-10-27 20:00:00;10 minutes;Orange white orbs moving silent I walked outside to take the trash out and I saw to large orbs moving south east and one was bright orange and one was white.  I do not believe it was an aircraft because of the size of the lights and the speed they were moving they were moving around each other and were larger than the moon.   There was no noise and they were moving extremely fast.  I have seen rockets and all kinds of aircraft in this area but this did not resemble anything of the sort.   My kids came outside to look at the orbs and they also were very intrigued by the site.   I thought maybe they were landing lights of an aircraft but they were moving away from me for a very good distance and the appearance of the lights never changed it appeared that they were high in the sky and moving over the ocean.   I was a police officer for several years and I have seen my share of strange things but this was unexplainable to me.;28.3695667189955;-80.7175572998433
Small round object that went from three green lights to three red lights very quickly.;2015-08-23 20:00:00;2 hours;Small round object that went from three green lights to three red lights very quickly. I was sitting in the car at my boyfriend's work waiting for him to go on break.  At about 8:39, I noticed a green light fly somewhat slowly past the cruise ships.  I figured it was a plane due to how high up it was.  So I just brushed it off.  About 10 minutes later I noticed it again this time coming from the way it just came from.  Now I was getting curious as to what would be out here like this at this time of night.  I saw it go by a couple more times.  My boyfriend came out for his break and I was telling him about it.  He didn't believe me until I said look, it's right there.   It was now facing us about 750 away but just hovering.  As my boyfriend pulled out the camera the object turned.  I don't know if it spun around or what but it turned red.  The lights we.t Dr on green to red quickly. It hovered there for a while.  A good 5 minutes. But the thing is, when we went to drive away to go get somebody, it started flying away,  this time very quickly.  There was a mini-van parked about 100 feet away that were standing there watching right along with us.  We did end up getting a man standing next to my boyfriend's work that also works there and he saw it too.  I had never believed in Aliens until August 23, 2015!!;28.3695667189955;-80.7175572998433

3 ufos hovering Kennedy Space Center.  ((anonymous report));2017-06-24 22:00:00;5-8 minutes;3 ufos hovering Kennedy Space Center. 3 crafts hovering over Kennedy space center last night.  It started with one bright light, very still, then all the sudden, it started hovering around.  Soon after, two smaller, dimmer, craft appeared.  The two smaller ones were hovering above and around the bigger one.  It looked almost as if they were playing with each other.   The two smaller ones were there for only a few minutes and they just disappeared.  The bigger one got super bright after the smaller ones disappeared.  It almost looked like it was coming toward us.  It then started getting dimmer until it completely disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous provides no contact information.
