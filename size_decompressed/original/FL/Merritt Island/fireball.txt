Five red fireballs.;2010-07-18 21:00:00;6 minutes;Five red fireballs Me and my friend were leaving the house around 9:00 pm to go bike riding. As we were getting on our bikes i looked to the northwest and saw 3 fireballs slowy come from knowhere and start to move to the north.   After watching them for about 2min as they started to speed up and go up into the sky, about a 1min later 2 more came up and did the same thing.  They were yellow fireballs with a red aura.   I took a video but the files got corrupted ( of course ).   This is all me and my friend saw tonight. i also took a picture but its a little blurry ill try to send that.;28.3695667189955;-80.7175572998433
Fireball over Merritt Island - leveled off and headed north toward space center;2011-08-19 21:59:00;30 seconds;Fireball over Merritt Island - leveled off and headed north toward space center I saw an orange fireball through a skylight and alerted everyone to it's presence. We all raced outside in time to see it make a coarse correction and to see the flame dissipate. At first it appeared to be falling straight towards us however at some point it leveled off and flew in a north, north east direction straight toward Kennedy Space Center from our point of view. While it was falling the flame appeared quite large, after it leveled off the flame was mostly out however it did NOT lose speed or altitude during it's flight.  It's as if the flame was turned off but we could still see the afterglow until it got to far away. None of us saw a craft of any type.  The flame was too bright to see anything around it however there were 2 distinct intensities of luminescence.  The center portion was a yellow(er), more intense light than the outside area.  The outside light while still very bright was almost translucent.  Both lights dimmed at approximately the same rate. It moved completely across the sky in less than 30 seconds however there is no telling how long it was falling as I only saw it when it came into view.  I estimate it was traveling faster than a small plane, even as quick as a jet. One person described it as a rocket but I don't think that was likely considering it was descending and made no audible noise though the wind notoriously blows south west here so that isn't surprising.;28.3695667189955;-80.7175572998433
Bright green fireball with yellow glowing trail moving low in the sky diagonally.  Coming from  south to north possibly toward N.A.S.A.;2011-12-17 19:00:00;15 seconds;Bright green fireball with yellow glowing trail moving low in the sky diagonally.   Coming from  south to north possibly toward N.A.S.A. on northern Merritt Island.  Moving very fast.    I've witnessed many reentries of rocket, debris, etc. from space as I've lived in Brevard County where Kennedy Space Center is (about 5 miles from the site.  The speed was one like a meteor.  No trail left. No aura. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));28.3695667189955;-80.7175572998433
Fireball 5 seconds;2012-04-15 03:23:00;5 seconds;Fireball 5 seconds I saw a reddish/orange fireball falling from the sky.  My sighting was facing north, similar to where I have seen prior rocket launchings from Cape Canaveral.  I ran outside to watch it and it was gone. It happened very quickly and caught my attention because it was very bright and quite large, much larger than a shooting star.  I immediately entered fireball in the sky in Google to see if anyone else had a sighting and noticed several reports and locations on various dates.;28.3695667189955;-80.7175572998433
