Very large rectangular transparent object;2020-07-11 10:30:00;2 minutes;Very large rectangular transparent object Was in the backyard, enjoying the morning on my patio, looking south. Clear weather. The property to the south is grassland with a house and some apartments a football fields length away.  The area is wide open. Suddenly, I noticed an object moving slowly from my right well above the buildings to the south,  I realized it was some sort of rectangular object, it seemed to be transparent,  I could see an actual framework inside, I realized that it was possibly 20 miles south and was heading east. I gauged it to be easily 20 x 30 feet at the distance I was seeing it, which made me think it was probably much larger.  It moved in a straight line to my left towards the ocean until I lost sight of it.  There was no wobbling or spinning of the object. I spend almost every day outside on my patio, feeding the birds and squirrels in the morning and doing other activities and have never seen anything like this. We have a small airport about 6 miles south, so we see small airplanes and helicopters regularly.  We have an Air Force base about 15 miles south of my place, with large planes and helicopters, there is an International airport about 60 miles west of my place, we have become used to seeing air traffic of all sorts over the years, but nothing like this. It was almost like a giant box kite that had no covering, there was no sound.  I wonder if anyone else reported this event because the object was so large.;28.3695667189955;-80.7175572998433
