White yellow light jumping around in the sky over Brevard county, FL;1997-06-01 21:00:00;2 or 4 minutes;White yellow light jumping around in the sky over Brevard county, FL On the evening I saw the object, I don't remember it being cold out, but it was on Merritt Island, Florida, so the temperatures are never freezing cold, but i don't remember being humid sweaty hot either like summer.  It was probably fall.  It was quite a while ago.  Having lived in central Florida for a majority of my life & my entire adult life, I've seen many things in the sky.  I've seen weather balloons.  I know venus, jupiter, the big & little dippers, orions belt, the pleides, mars, and the moon when I see them.  I've seen jets, planes, blimps, and rockets.  Patrick Air Force Base is in cocoa beach, florida, and I've seen the jets taking and off and landing there many times.  I've seen the Blue Angels do their show.  I've been to the space center & I've been to plane shows at the air force base.  I've seen spotlights lighting up events in cocoa village and from orlando and disney world.  I've seen many many rockets take off.  I've seen the space shutt! le come back to Kennedy Space Center (from my yard) riding piggy back on the jet.  I saw the Challenger blow up.  I've seen satellites.  I've seen the space shuttle when it just unhooked from the ISS and both were traveling across the sky - tandem stars in the sky, so i feel pretty confident about seeing things in the sky.  I've been an avid sky-watcher my whole life.  I've seen the perseid meteor shower several times and i've seen quite a few falling stars and eclipses of the sun and moon.  We lived in the shadow of Kennedy Space Center - I've been around space stuff my whole adult life.  But the night I'm writing about I saw something I can't explain, that i've never seen before or since.  I was facing east, and I saw a round whitish-yellow light pretty high up in the sky that I would say was the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length.  I figured it had to be quite a ways up, perhaps a mile or so, but that's just a guess.  As I looked at it, it moved, but not like ! a plane moves in a straight line and you can see it moving at ! a regula r pace, this thing just jumped to a new point in the sky, not very far away, but it ... jumped ... it did not flow along smoothly.  I pointed at it and asked myself out loud what is THAT? as it 'jumped' from one point to another, moving from the eastern sky towards the north. I kept pointing at it and turning to face the north - and it kept moving on towards the west in those weird li'l 'jumps'.  Not just left or right or up or down, but randomly it seemed to me, horizontally and diagonally and vertically as well.  I kept pointing at it as it kept moving around until I was facing south and then it was still for a moment and then ~~~ ZZIP~~~ it disappeared.  I've never seen anything like it again.  Of course I did not get any pictures of it.  I'm not real sure of the date.  I had looked and looked at the skies before this event, and especially since, in case I'd ever be privileged to see anything else unexpected, and I'm planning on continuing to do so every chance I get.! Thank you very much;28.3695667189955;-80.7175572998433

What I notice late;2005-11-15 11:12:00;1 minute;There was a full moon out and i decided it would be a good picture so I started filming the moon with my cell phone. What I notice later when I am  reviewing the video clip is that there is a light moving all around the moon. The light at one time goes into the moons path and dissapears then reapears right after. It was a very fast light with seemingly jerk movements.;28.3695667189955;-80.7175572998433
Some thing go from West to East durning the shuttle launch.;2007-10-23 11:39:00;15-20 seconds;Some thing go from West to East durning the shuttle launch. On 10/23/2007 we had some friends down for a visit and they wanted to see the space shuttle lift off before they left to go home.  I decided to take them to KARS Park on Merritt Island, Florida.  This is a park for Kennedy Space Port works and family.  It is about as close as you can get with out getting on KSC, 10-15 miles away. I was taking movie pictures with my camera and the shuttle had lifted off.  About one to one and a half minutes after the launch I pulled away from the camera and look up and saw some thing going from West to East at a high rate of speed.  It was bright and looked like a flying saucer shape but you just saw a yellow light.  I asked my friends and some other people around us if they saw it and they said that they did see some thing. I first thought that it was a chase plane to take pictures of the shuttle but quickly decided that it was not a chase plane.  They have land base camera’s that can give you better pictures than a chase plane.  Also if a plane is in the launch area they will not launch the shuttle.  I have seen many shuttle launches since I live close to Cape Canaveral.  I have never seen any thing like this before.  I retired from the Air Force and have seen F-16’s, F-15’s, SR-71 and F-18’s flying at all altitudes and this was none of those. I tried to get a movie of the UFO but it was so bright I could not tell if I was getting good pictures.  Once I got home I downloaded the movie onto my computer to see if I got any thing.  I found that I had about a second of the light but I could not tell what it was.  I looked at each frame that I had and each frame was different.  It was not a good movie you can not tell any thing from what I have but a light in the sky. I was so sure that the news would have some thing on this but no one reported any thing about the ufo/light.  I don’t understand this at all.;28.3695667189955;-80.7175572998433
low flying bright light above home star shaped light fast horizontal movement in night sky;2010-06-08 21:00:00;10-15min;low flying bright light above home star shaped light fast horizontal movement in night sky I was driving home around 9pm with my two sons when i was about to pull into the driveway i saw a bright bright light over my house about 50ft up. I immediately began to drive away toward my parents house 15miles away.  As I was pulling away the lights were i would say about the size of two big trucks at 50ft up.  They began to dim and move higher in the sky.  A few miles away it was higher in the sky and smaller but it had moved rapidly in a zipping horizontal movement across the bridge i was heading over.  At this point it was the size of maybe a cluster of 3 or 4 bright stars.  As I drove the final 2 or 3 miles the light shrunk to the size of 1 bright star size or planet.  The light remained stationary for the next 2 or 3 hrs then disappeared beyond the horizon,  As if it was a fixed star.  The light would at times elongate itself to a vertical point.  The light was extremely bright when above my home but emmited no light on any surface or surroundings. at some poin! t while driving it caused my car radio to shut off.

Lights moving North east to south west;2016-03-06 18:50:00;20 minutes;March 6, 2016.  I was driving with my wife, stepdaughter, and two grandchildren at about 1850 hours, when we notice a line of lights moving North East to South West.   I pulled over into Veterans Park behind the Merritt Square Mall on Merritt Island  to take a look at the lights.  I  got out of the car and I thought I heard helicopters off in the distance.  Patrick AFB is South  of our location so I thought that it was something going on at the base.   I got back in the car and turned around and stopped and opened my wife’s  window  to let her hear what I thought where helicopters.  She said that she couldn’t hear anything.  I got out of the car to listen and look at the lights and I could not hear any noise. We looked again and saw a lot more of the light moving in the same line, North East to South West.  I got out of the car and looked and listened and could not hear anything.  I got my phone and used the camera and started taking a movie of the lights.  We would watch a group of 10 to 15 lights go by when another line of lights would appear.  It looked like the lights would disappear when they got on passed us in the same place.  This lasted around 20 minutes.  Finally the lights stopped and we went on our way. It looked like they were coming from Cape Canaveral which was north of us and I estimated the lights where about 1000 to 2000 feet high.   Patrick AFB does not have that many aircraft assigned to the base so I don’t believe they came from the base.  Most of the time when I am out at the base I might see a couple of helicopters and two to three C-130s. I don’t know what the lights where.  Thought they might be lanterns but they seemed to high to have come from the city of Cape Canaveral.  I really don’t know what they were.;28.3695667189955;-80.7175572998433

Stationary, not moving. I took video. We watched for a few minutes as two aircraft, helicopters or small aircraft, with blinking red lights flew in the vicinity or appeared to fly in the vicinity of the objects. We went to the store and ten minutes later the objects were no longer in the sky.;28.3695667189955;-80.7175572998433
