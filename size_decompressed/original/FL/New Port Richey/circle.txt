FEB 15, 2002 WE SAW A LARGE ROUND CRAFT THAT HOVERD 1 MILE FROM MY HOME FOR ABOUT 5 TO 10 MINS;2002-02-15 19:00:00;5 to 10 mins;FEB 15, 2002 WE SAW A LARGE ROUND CRAFT THAT HOVERD 1 MILE FROM MY HOME FOR ABOUT 5 TO 10 MINS we saw a large craft in daylight hours hovering 1 mile from my home. as large as it  was there was not sound coming from this craft. It was round in shape,color was black and lights all around that were red in color and the lights flashed in oreder which each other. the craft stayed there about 5 to 10 mins long enough to see it and know what it was.  Thesize was about the size of 2 big homes put together, and not a sound came from this craft and it was so close to us i could hardly believe it. i had never seen one. But I tell you now I know what I saw and it was a space craft. now I didnt see who was flying this craft. but I can suerly tell you now, that we are not alone on this planet.  ther have been times i have been on my back patio were i saw this craft and heard sounds in the air of something flying over head but didnt see anything in the sky. i have heard these crafts are known to become invisable and fly and no one see them. i believe thats why no sees when the cropt circles are being done and showing up so quickly. makes since to me. But see this is believeing.  sorry this experiance came late to your website i just found it today 05/25/2005 and wanted to share it with you. i have talked with other people here in florida that say they have seen  crafts here too. and they have freacked out about it and when they hear me talk about it,they open up and tell there experiance. i guess they are afraid people will say there crazy are something. but buddy this is no joke, I saw what I saw and that is believeing enough for me.  I thought it was cool. I wanted to get closer, but I didnt I am kind of a trill seeker daredevil I guess you would say. but this is no lie, if i hadnt seen it for my self i probably would not of believed it either.  WHY IT STAYED THERE TO LET US SEE IT THAT LONG AND AT A SHORT DISTANCE i DONT KNOW BUT IT DID. AND AFTER THAT IT JUST MOVED IN A NORTH EAST DIRECTION IN A SLOW SPEED INTILL IT DISAPERED FROM SIGHT. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) THIS LARGE CRAFT  WAS 1 MILE FROM MY HOME HOVERING CLOSE TO THE GROUND JUST ABOVE THE TREE TOPS VERY CLOSE I WROTE EARLIER TO YALL ABOUT THE LARGE CRAFT WE SAW IN THE SKY.I ALSO MEANT TO TELL YOU THAT NOT ONLY WAS THIS CRAFT 1 MILE FROM THE HOME.BUT IT HOVERED LOW TO THE GROUND ALSO,JUST ABOVE THE TREE TOPS SO IT WAS CLOSE FOR US TO SEE IT. REALLY TO CLOSE ITWAS KINDA SCARY. WHY WOULD THEY BE THAT CLOSE, AND WHY STAY THERE THAT LONG DURING THE DAY FOR US TO SEE AT THAT MOMENT. THEY HAD TO OF SEEN US LOOKING AT THEM. WOW IT WAS AMAZING. BUT I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THAT THE CRAFT WAS VAEY CLOSE TO US AND CLOSE TO THE GROUND WERE WE COULD SEE IT AS PLAIN AS DAY ITS SELF.  I COULDNT GET A PICTURE NO FILM, ISNT THAT JUST GREAT. WOULDNT YOU KNOW IT, AT A TIME LIKE THIS NO FILM.  BUT WHO REALLY WOULD HAVE BELIEVED IT ANY WAY. MOST PEOPLE WOULD OF SAID THATS A JOKE.INTO THEY SEE IT FOR THEM SELVES.
