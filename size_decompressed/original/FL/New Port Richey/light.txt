Helicopter and red/orange orb sighting.;2002-08-22 20:45:00;10 mins;Helicopter and red/orange orb sighting. I observed a helicopter being trailed by a red/orange orb that from my vantage point appeared smaller than the copter. It trailed 20 meters behind it at the beginning of my sighting then overtook it in one fluid motion.It paced the copter 20 meters ahead after. I lost site of both when a home blocked my vision. What convinced me was the fluidity by which it went from behind then in front of the chopper... smooth as silk. Heicopter made sound and cabin was lit. Orb was not audible.;28.2421548229553;-82.7047956043941
2 bright orange-red twinkling lights traveling in tandem, then climbed and faded away;2012-01-19 21:46:00;2 minutes;2 bright orange-red twinkling lights traveling in tandem, then climbed and faded away At about 9:46 my wife, my soon and myself watched two redish twinkling lights in the sky traveling south to north at about a 45 deg inclination in the southern sky.   I thought it was two helicopters flying together at first when my wife pointed them out by how slow they were moving toward us...then the rear most just rose up and faded away....about ten sec later the other did the same.   A few minutes later a few normal airplanes crossed the same area and you could see them plainly and tell they were planes and there was was no clouds that created any color change to the lighting.  I could even think a pair of fighter jets flying in tandem and one going vertical followed by the other, but the light wasn't white, no flashing red and green and the fact they each climbed what I would guess to be several thousand feet then just fading away from super bright orange-red to nothing in 5 seconds;28.2421548229553;-82.7047956043941
Ball of white light turns to green streak across the sky vertically, heading downward.;2012-05-26 05:45:00;15 seconds;Ball of white light turns to green streak across the sky vertically, heading downward. Ball of bright white light was seen in the southeastern skyline. Traveling either straight down or directly away from me.  The ball of light accelerated streaking into a vibrant green smear vertically across the sky.  I was given the impression the object was traveling away from me as it gradually faded, instead of continuing downward.  The experience was short lived, accompanied by no sounds indicating fireworks or man made projectiles, it was early morning.;28.2421548229553;-82.7047956043941
Two bright orange lights hovering low in the sky.;2013-11-11 21:00:00;4 minutes;Two bright orange lights hovering low in the sky There were two bright orange lights, not very high in the sky.  They crossed over each other and then they looked liked they were just hovering for about 4 minutes.  They then seemed to go further away and finally disappeared.;28.2421548229553;-82.7047956043941
Ball of light travelling high up, silent.;2014-09-16 06:00:00;90 seconds;Ball of light travelling high up, silent I got up early one morning it was around 5:56am. Alarm was set for 7am but thought I’d get up and check the weather outside.  It was still dark and the sky was extremely clear, no clouds, and the stars were quite visible.  I decided to go get my camera and take some pictures of the stars since there were so many and visibility was excellent.  I looked up at a group of stars and noticed one of them was moving.  It was a ball of light, silent, and travelling fairly quickly. I thought to myself this is no star or meteorite because of the speed of the object.  I’ve seen meteorites and they fade out pretty fast and travel like a bullet and are gone.  I grabbed my camera and tried to film it with no success. It was pretty high up, maybe 3-5000 feet up.  I watched it for about 90 seconds until it was no longer in sight. Then lo and behold another appeared travelling high up and went by one of those stars that twinkle and appear to change color.  It was also high up (ball of light) and I couldn’t focus for a good picture.  At the same moment in a different area in the sky there was an airplane flying with the typical blinking navigational lights and jet engine sound.  The two were completely different. Then my attention was drawn to this apparent star that was very bright and changing color. Even to the naked eye I could see it change color. I had my camera on a tripod and started to shoot video and a few pictures. This object whatever it was bluish in color and went from a ball of light to a hexagon with a slight dark spot in the middle. Do stars change colors and shapes?? I don’t know. I thought maybe it was the Earth’s atmosphere and it’s distance from Earth that caused these variations in shape and color. Whatever it was it was fascinating to watch and I videotaped it for about 16 minutes. Unfortunately the balls of light just wouldn’t cooperate with my camera. Here’s an interesting tidbit. I was going through the reports on your site and noticed someone in Surfside Beach, SC reported a red ball of light in the sky on 9/19/14. They said when they zoomed in, it looked like a human brain with shades of gray. Although I couldn’t capture this with my camera, when I used my! binoculars to look at this apparent star, it too looked like a brain in the sky. It was really cool looking and when I went out of focus with the binoculars is when it looked like a wired brain in the sky. I thought maybe I was seeing things. Now I know someone else saw a ball of light when zooming in taking on the appearance of a brain. I think I will coin the term UFB,meaning unidentified flying brain”. Of course I’m poking a little fun at this but this story is absolutely true. I think many people see odd things in our skies but never take the time to ponder something really different just happened. If I can I will post the picture of this pulsating star and video on your site.;28.2421548229553;-82.7047956043941

Brightest ball of light;2019-11-21 19:29:00;<1 minute;Brightest ball of light My sister and I were driving to go pick an item up from another house, it was dark, I was coming up to turn right & I had noticed a very very bright light in the sky to my front but towards the left of me. It was NOT moving or blinking. I told my sister to look at it and asked her opinion of what it was, neither of us could find an explanation for what we were seeing. It was as bright as a star, when we both looked at it, it looked blurred around the edges, the ball of light was just so bright. Anyways I had slowed down coming up to turn still with my eye on it in disbelief, I took about 5 mins to pick up the item and get back to the spot where we seen the ball of light and it was gone. We never seen it move, only seen one object. It was the most incredible light I’ve ever seen especially so close.  I was traveling on Troublecreek RD (where I seen object ) and I turned left on Weasel Drive and that’s when I lost sight.;28.2421548229553;-82.7047956043941
I was driving to work I had my daughter and mother in the vehicle with me as we all work together at same place. I seen a orange light;2019-12-20 06:45:00;5 min.;I was driving to work I had my daughter and mother in the vehicle with me as we all work together at same place. I seen a orange light in the sky, my mom thought it was a plane but me and my daughter thought it was definitely not! Next thing you know the light has a trail behind it rapidly growing longer and longer it had colors inside the trail of whites and orange and yellow and it was stretching across the sky not up or down. As the trail got longer the orange light disappeared. I was looking for anything in the news and found nothing, no rocket, no comets, zilch. But 32 miles away my boyfriend captured a video of the same sighting.;28.2421548229553;-82.7047956043941
