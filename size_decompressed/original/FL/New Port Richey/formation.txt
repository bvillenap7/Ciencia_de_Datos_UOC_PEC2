Silent craft red blinking lights w/ one white light.;2014-05-24 11:15:00;~5 seconds;Silent craft red blinking lights w/ one white light. At approximately 11-11:30 pm, I was out checking a radiator leak on my vehicle.  After taking it for a ride I parked in my driveway and was sitting in my car thinking that I’d have to replace the radiator. I noticed 4 people walking in front of my car on their way home.  I heard the neighbors across the street and I guess they were having a little get-together. After they walked down the street about 75 yards I was sitting in my car with the door open when suddenly I saw a very low flying craft just above the tree line descending into the adjacent neighborhood.  I thought that was odd because there is no airport or landing strip there. The object did not look like a typical airplane or helicopter, and made no noise at all. It had two bright red lights in the front and one white light at the back.  The red lights were alternately pulsating or blinking.  It was sort of a triangle shape although I couldn’t see any definite form to it, but that was the impression I had, some sort of triangle although I can’t be certain of that. I heard a story from the guy that replaced our garage door opener that an older couple he did some work for said they saw a UFO come out of the retention pond in back of their house and silently fly over the trees and disappear. The retention pond is about 1-2 miles from my house.;28.2421548229553;-82.7047956043941

I was sitting under a very cloudy night in Florida at or about 2:30 AM.  I saw a light coming through the clouds but didn’t pay much attention.  Thought it was a clearing in the sky for the moon to come through but it turned out to be more than that.  It sat there in the shape of a vessel and later to see bright blue lights go off to its side.  Releasing other vessels.  Smaller ones to over see.  It sat silently there no other aircraft around.  No sound.  But it after about a half hou,r just silently went back up into the clouds. So my words to you.  Is I’ll never ever see a thing like this but I want to be notified of your input.  Thank you ((name deleted));28.2421548229553;-82.7047956043941
