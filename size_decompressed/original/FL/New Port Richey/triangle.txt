I put the car in park and realized it emitted no sound, I therefore turned the car off and still could here no sound. I then got out of car,family still screeming hysterically and walked directly beneath it and could only discern a slight whirring noise. Allthough I could see 3 small lights, 1 on each corner I say corners, but body of craft was not visable, even at this close distance 50'.   I stood directly beneath this object and was completely awestruck, since I could not see the body I bent down to pick up a rock with intention to strike the object no harm meant I just wanted to verify a solid structure. As I bent down my family really started to go nuts and my wife screemed that it was beginning to movesouth unable to find a rock in the dark I jumped into the car, turned around and gave pursuit, It never exhibited any great speed but the faster I went the faster it went probably hitting top speed of 60-80mph, when we reached the end of street it did something that in my judgement was more amazing, the front of the craft rose 30-40degrees climbed aprox. 50 ' banked hard left and disappeared out of view without any legible sound at all. This occurred on Atlee street was willow st.aprox. 6-7 miles from gulf of mexico in somewhat rural area. I reported to sheriffs office, they thought I was a nut.I did not know who to report to who would take serious. Me, my wife and my children know what we saw, and there is no craft in existance that could hover or fly in this manner without any discernable noise to my knowledge. It has made me a believer. Hovering at tree top level, slightly off edge of roadway, triangular arranged lights with point aiming due south, hovered for at least 5 minutes with no detecktable sound except for very faint whirring. Distance between lights 40-50 feet, my best example of size would be a double wide mobile home cut into triangle. Body was not visable, but should have been!! Allthough it was night time, at this distance it should have been visable. My wife, myself and 3 of my children were present and witnessed it allthough my youngest son at the time was to young to remember the physical aspects he remembers the screeming. After hovering for aprox. 5 min. it started drifting south and steadily gained speed, giving chase I could not catch it traveling up to 50mph on a dirt road, it abrutly climbed about 50' banked hard left and disappeared over the potberg ranch territory. It also appeared the next evening, flew diagnoly over our house then down the backroad and emitted some bright flashes that lit up the whole block, I took some video but all thatwas visable was 3 lites.;28.2421548229553;-82.7047956043941

The closer I got to it I could see the shape of a triangle.  It still did not move as I drove by it.    When I turned around to look st it again it had elevated and then gone from sight. There was different dimensions to the triangle shape.  Bright light in the front.  Green light on one side and blue light on the other. It definitely was not an airplane or helicopter. I found it amazing how it just hovered.;28.2421548229553;-82.7047956043941
