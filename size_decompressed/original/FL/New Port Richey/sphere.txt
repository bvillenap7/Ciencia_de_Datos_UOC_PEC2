Orange/reddish perfect sphere/glowing.;2013-01-01 00:00:00;20 minutes;orange/reddish perfect sphere/glowing Outside watching some fireworks just after new years around 12:15 a.m.My neighbor and I were watching the sky over our rooftops as the last fireworks were over.We then saw a glowing sphere,orange and red in color,moving southwest over my roof,approximately 200 ft above.  My first thought was this must be a Chinese lantern,having never seen one before.  My neighbor said it was too contained and perfect in shape,and the glow was too uniform in to be flame.  As we watched it moving at approximately 35 m.p.h,about 1 minute later a 2nd one, then 3rd and so on until we counted 9 of them.  they followed each other in line and as we watched them start to ascend higher they started moving in different directions and elevations as we watched them fade off in the distance.  They seemed controlled and peaceful.;28.2421548229553;-82.7047956043941
