Pulsating disc turns into a ball of light.;2013-12-25 19:00:00;16 minutes;Pulsating disc turns into a ball of light I have seen some unknown objects in the sky many nights now.  One time coming home from work I noticed a very bright object in the sky.  Since I have seen this object many times I jokingly said to myself  OK fellows I'm headed home if you want to get some pictures please follow me.  It appeared to move as I drove home.  It was appearing out of my right passenger side window. When I turned down a street closer to where I live, low and behold...there it was, a bright ball of light in the sky.  I pulled over onto the grass and got my Canon camera.  I leaned on my car and carefully zoomed in with the camera at 140x magnification.  To the naked eye it looked like a star.  With the camera zoomed in, it appeared to be a large pulsating disc with rings in it.  It also appeared to a have a darker center, sometimes going from small to slightly larger.  Sometimes it looked circular, other times it looked octagonal.  It looked like a large pulsating, living, organism.  ! I stopped filming and went home where I noticed it again, low on the horizon just above the tree line but far away.  I got out the camera again and this time the pulsating disc shrunk into a ball of light.  At one point it appeared to have some sort of flashing tail, appearing only for a few seconds at a time.  The tail always pointed in an upward direction.  I have filmed these pulsating discs many times over the last week or so.  Usually they always shrink into a ball of light almost as if they know someone is filming them.  I have never witnessed such incredible phenomenon in my whole life.  These discs look like what the astronauts have filmed at the Space Station, large pulsating discs flying in space where the International Space Station is.  I'd be curious to see what an astronomer would think of my video.  Maybe they can be rationally explained, maybe not.  That's why they are termed  UFO's.;28.2421548229553;-82.7047956043941
Orange balls of light zoomed in are orange pulsating hexagonal shaped discs.;2013-12-31 20:00:00;15-20 minutes;Orange balls of light zoomed in are orange pulsating hexagonal shaped discs I know it's been over two weeks since I've seen these craft but I'm reading other reports that are very similar to what I saw.  I first noticed an orange orb in the sky when I was chatting on the phone with a friend.  I quickly hung up after I told her what I saw but by the time I got my camera out it had moved too far away to get a good shot. I was traveling down Little rd. talking to my sister when I saw the orange craft/orb out the driver's side window.  This time I quickly pulled my car onto a side street and got my camera and began filming.  To the naked eye it looked like an orange orb but zoomed in it was a orange pulsating disc, hexagonal in shape.It headed in a SW direction and kept going until it disappeared out of sight.  I got into my car and pulled into the WAWA (gas/convenience store) at Little and Ridge rd.  When I came out I noticed what looked like a plane flying very low in a circular pattern, almost as if it was looking for something. This is where it gets exciting and crazy. I pulled back onto Little rd. heading east and stopped at the light. Looking out my window on my side I saw it coming again, and it was at a low altitude, maybe no more than 500 feet up.  I actually shoved my car into park ( the light even turned green but no one was behind me) and started shooting video.  I got out of my car and right there in the intersection I'm filming this orange ball of light.  Zoomed in it was the same orange pulsating disc that almost appeared to be an organism, like it was alive, making small jumps, up and down and sideways.  I filmed until it got out of view.  There was a black Jeep to my left and when I noticed the window was open a bit I yelled to the two people inside  Look a UFO.  They were oblivious to the event but then looked up and said wow. Now it continues to get crazier.  From the same exact direction, same altitude, here it comes again.  Orange ball of light to the naked eye...zoomed in, orange pulsating disc, no sound. It wasn't moving fast and wasn't moving slow, just a steady pace.  If it was on the road I'd say maybe no more than 50 miles an hour, if that.  And low and behold, behind the first one comes a second one, orange ball of light.  This time the jeep had left and there was a young girl in a subcompact sitting at the light. I yelled look at the UFO and she also looked up and said something.  WOW, people need to pay attention to their surroundings.  This second one was slightly lower than the first, silent, orange orb traveling in a SW direction. I filmed this one also.  These orange orbs did a flyover at Little and Ridge rd. at least 4 times. Later that evening around 10-10:30 pm while walking down Alico pass where it intersects with Starkey blvd. I saw two orange orbs flying low but this time they were pretty far away.  One was flying a little lower than the the lead one, and it soon disappeared from sight.  I did get video of this episode but it was far away and only for a few brief moments before it too disappeared from view. I'll put my hand on a stack of Holy Bibles what I'm saying is true.  This was the most exciting sighting I've had recently.  Actually, I've seen a few unusual craft in the sky lately.  Not sure why and I'm not crazy because video doesn't lie.  I will be making a short documentary about my sightings and posting on Youtube.  I'll let you know when this happens.;28.2421548229553;-82.7047956043941
Dark grey saucer witnessed by 3.;2017-08-21 19:00:00;3 minutes;Dark grey saucer witnessed by 3. Saw a dark grey saucer shaped craft move in close to a drone that was flying.  Then backed away toward the east.  Then came back toward the west.  It had absolutely no sound or lighting.;28.2421548229553;-82.7047956043941
Saw what looked like large fireballs, orange to red in color, approach from the west (Gulf of Mexico) and hover for a few seconds above;2019-12-25 00:15:00;3 minutes;Saw what looked like large fireballs, orange to red in color, approach from the west (Gulf of Mexico) and hover for a few seconds above our small lake.  Then moved very abruptly south.  A moment later a trio of the same objects repeated the same, these three hovered together for slightly longer.  We were able to make out a round shape, with the underneath having an alternating pattern of 3 straight lines and 3 pod shapes which together resembled a flower-like pattern.  I assumed this was the power source.  The trio also moved abruptly to the south.  Another minute passed and a single object appeared and did the exact same thing, for a total of 5 objects.  We heard no sound whatsoever from the objects.;28.2421548229553;-82.7047956043941
3 Lights Hovering in the Sky;2020-09-18 22:00:00;30 minutes;3 Lights Hovering in the Sky First I saw one lighted object and 30 seconds later 2 more appeared  under and to side of first one. I lingered for 1/2 an hour no movement. Gave up watching was very tired.;28.2421548229553;-82.7047956043941
