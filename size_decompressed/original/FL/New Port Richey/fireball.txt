I was really excited, but my wife didn’t seem to fazed over it, and sort of took the wind out of my sails because she didn’t think it was anything from another world, and it may not of been, I’d like to know if this explanation is consistent with things like a weather balloon, do they fly that  fast and at night?  Do they routinely fly one after ano! ther, this was not going up, it was flying across the night sk! y, and I ’m sorry I never documented exactly when it did happen, I just know it was about 5 or 6 months ago…..would love some opinions.

Orange fireballs travelling in a pair.;2015-12-01 22:00:00;90 seconds;Orange Fireballs travelling in a pair I was returning from a trip to my gym, when I suddenly noticed an orange fireball in the sky. I was travelling north on little rd.  As I drove on a second orange fireball came into view travelling behind the other one. I knew these couldn’t planes because of the fireball appearance.   At that point I was looking for a place to pull over so I could observe them and take a picture with my Canon camera that travels with me all the time. I finally pulled over into an entrance and stopped.  By that time there were now to my left.  Very orange in appearance and fiery.   I fumbled around with my camera and by then they had moved farther away, making a picture not possible, or at least a good one.  I then pulled back out onto Little Rd., and from that vantage point, farther away and still to my left, they were dimmed in color, still orange, but now appearing translucent and glasslike.   They were moving at a fairly slow pace, approximately 500 – 700 feet in altitude.   I know other people had to see these objects as they were so bright and orange, fireballs, and completely silent.;28.2421548229553;-82.7047956043941

It did not drop altitude but moved rather slowly with making no noise. Then it broke apart into two parts and continued out of sight. It never dimmed, but was constant fireball with a tail.;28.2421548229553;-82.7047956043941
