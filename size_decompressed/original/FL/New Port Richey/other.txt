X-shaped object hovered above my house for 20-30 minutes.;2000-12-17 03:00:00;20-30 minutes;X-shaped object hovered above my house for 20-30 minutes. The object was grayish black in color. The shape was an x shaped with a sphere shape in the middle. The top of the sphere had a ruby red glow looking somewhat like a window. The x parts were curved up at the tips. Also had around 8 long spikes on the bottom of the spherical section of it. The object was hovering above my house probably at a range guessing of only 50-70 Feet above my house. It made a extremly low humming noise. It stayed a that exact position for about 20-30 minutes.  The time was 3:00 AM. The conditions was heavy clouds and cold out. ((NUFORC Note:  We regret that this K12 student apparently did not have sufficient time to photograph the object.  It would have been quite the photograph!  PD));28.2421548229553;-82.7047956043941
Non moving triple white lights in southeatersn sky.;2003-09-12 21:00:00;all night;Non moving triple white lights in southeatersn sky. Three side by side lights, one larger in the center flanked by two smaller ones.  This is in the southeastern sky.  We have observed this two nights running and are observing it now.  We only have binoculars and can make out the three distinct lights which are bright white, not colored.  This, whatever it is, does not move at all.  It just sits there.  It seems to have moved over long periods but I think it is the earth movement that changes its position.  End of report.;28.2421548229553;-82.7047956043941
