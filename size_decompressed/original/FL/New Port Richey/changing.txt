Two Orange/ Yellowish morphing objects, 40' in the air with no sound accelerated at an increadible speed.;2013-01-01 21:27:00;11 seconds;Two Orange/ Yellowish morphing objects, 40' in the air with no sound accelerated at an increadible speed. ATT:Peter Davenport, Director  On January 2nd , 2013, I spoke with you by phone at approximately 12:00 am EST, explaining to you what I had witnessed earlier that evening.  You suggested I complete an Event Description form. At 21:27 on January 1st, 2013, I witnessed two objects approximately 60 yards south of me heading in a northern direction at approximately 40 feet in the air and traveling at 20-25 mph over a heavily populated residential area.  At first they both seemed to be triangle in shape, but as they flew over me they seemed to morph into globs of bright yellow, orange, reddish and very bright white.   As I watched them fly over me there was absolutely no sound or prop wash.  At about 100 yards past me the first one accelerated at an incredible speed as did the second one a few seconds later. As an Ex-Air Force personnel I am familiar with Military Aircraft (SR71â€™s, Stealth Fighters and numerous other aircraft) and maneuverability of such aircraft.  From my experience at many Air Force Bases around the world, no aircraft that I know of had the acceleration capabilities of these two objects, let alone the ability to morph.;28.2421548229553;-82.7047956043941
