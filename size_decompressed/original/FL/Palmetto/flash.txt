Unidentified floating flashing and blinking light in Palmetto Florida rural property.;2006-03-30 20:30:00;1 hour;Unidentified floating flashing and blinking light in Palmetto Florida rural property. We saw a floating light flashing periodically on our property.  The light is about the size of a baseball and appears to float across our property a fairly high speed.  I flashes then dims and then flashes a few yards away showing us it path of movement.  The light seems to know we are watching it because it approached our back porch where we were standing and watching it and came with 12 feet of where we were standing and landed in on the ground and continued to blink and flash slowly perhaps one blink every 6 seconds for about 4 minutes then we noticed the flashing was about 20 feet above the ground and it exited our view by floating into the forest behind our house.  When I shone a very high powered flashlight on it there was no visible structure to be seen. This thing has been here at least three times that we have seen it. It seems to have intellignece and seems to be very aware of our presence. We will attempt to video tape it tonight as proof but would prefer a professional to come and visit our property to make a more scientific evaluation of this unexplained object.;27.543;-82.5601999999999
