My husband and I were sitting outside by our canal, super clear, dark night, when we saw a fireball coming from the South heading North.  I asked my husband, “What is that?”   He looked up and said, “Wow, that’s weird – looks like something on fire.”  It was totally quiet as it passed over us, straight line, no jumping around, seemed about as high as a helicopter, no tail, looked like moving orange flames in an orb shape moving about the speed of a small plane.   I took a quick picture before it passed behind a large 2-story house and out of our view, but the picture doesn’t do it justice.;27.543;-82.5601999999999
