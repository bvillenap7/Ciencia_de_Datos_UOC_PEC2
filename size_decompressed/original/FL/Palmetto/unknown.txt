Yellow light fly in piroutte style movement;2016-12-24 21:50:00;2 minutes;Yellow light fly in piroutte style movement While stepping out to close lani windows I noticed to yellowish lights south of my location.  They seemed to be stationary for 15 second and then began to pirouette  and point to the west and started moving at nominal speed when one light moved to the south the other continued west.  The light headed south just disappeared in an instant while the other continued westerly and disappeared.  There were no flashing lights at all so don't believe it was airplanes.  I heard no sound from them whatsoever.;27.543;-82.5601999999999
