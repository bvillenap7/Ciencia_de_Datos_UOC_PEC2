1969 summer Ft. Lauderdale spiraling pinpoint of white light, spirals across the night sky with neon green cloud alongside.;1969-08-01 20:30:00;3--5 minutes;1969 summer Ft. Lauderdale spiraling pinpoint of white light, spirals across the night sky with neon green cloud alongside. I was 15 and living with my married sister (26) while she was pregnant in a residential area of Fort Lauderdale, FL near the inter-coastal waterway. We went into her backyard, behind the pool to steal lemons off of her neighbor's lemon tree.  It was dark and a clear night. My sister exclaimed & grabbed my arm & pointed up towards the sky.  STRAIGHT UP was the brightest white light I'd ever seen (brighter than a Klieg light), a pinpoint of white light that spiraled out in lines that were so even they could have been made with a 'compass'... the pinpoint of light continued to shine as the spiraling lines filled the entire upper horizon... but what was odd is that we could see through the widening white, spiraling lines... we could see the starry sky through the widening white lines.  Next to the pinpoint of white light was a neon green cloud.  A cloud, like a white cloud you'd seen on a blue-sky day, except this cloud was green and it glowed like a green neon sign.  We both stood there with our mouths agape and watched this entire phenomenon for about 2 minutes... the white, transparent, WIDE spiral lines filled the entire upper horizon and then the white pinpoint just stopped emanating light and the green cloud took a few more minutes to fade away.  Apparently, thousands of people in Ft. Lauderdale saw this and called into police.  NASA claimed the next day that it was a 'reflection off of a rocket that was shot over the ocean... as the sun was going down.'  The only problem is, it was DARK, it was 8:30 PM and the sun sets on the Gulf/west side of Florida.  We were on the east side of Florida, quite close to the Atlantic ocean (perhaps 1 mile).  There was no way this was a reflection off a rocket as it was STRAIGHT UP and the pinpoint of light was emanating from above the earth (from space) and it shown down to the atmosphere where it spread out across the entire upper sky.  In my opinion, some superior visitors were taking a very large 'photo' of the area.  The green cloud was translucent.  The white spiral lines were transparent.  I work in the film business and there is no light we have today that is as bright as the pinpoint of very white light was.

ONE NIGHT, I OBSERVED A STAR SUDDENLY MOVE QUITE A DISTANCE.  A FEW NIGHTS LATER, I OBSERVED BASICALLY THE SAME THING HAPPEN AGAIN, EXCEPT THIS TIME THE OBJECT WENT TOWARDS THE MOON.  THE OBJECT HEADED TOWARDS AND THEN THE LIGHT DISAPPEARED AS IT REACHED THE MOON AND THE LIGHT THEN REAPPEARED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOON. THAT IS WHEN I REALIZED THAT IT WAS A UFO.  I HAVE WITNESSED THESE OBJECTS ON 8 DIFFERENT OCCASSIONS IN PAST WEEK.  IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THEY DISGUISE THEMSELVED AS STARS TO THE COMMON PERSON WHO IS NOT PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION.  BUT IF PEOPLE WOULD JUST STOP AND REALLY LOOK THEY COULD SEE THEM JUST SITTING THERE.  ONE OF THE OBJECTS WAS COMING DOWN TOWARDS THE PLANET AND I COULD FIRE SURROUNDING IT AT ONE POINT AS IF IT WERE ENTERING THE ATOMSPHERE.  WHEN THE FIRE STOPPED, IT ALSO SHOT SIDEWAYS EXTREMELY FAST.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392

I don't remember exactly when i saw this, but i remember thinking it was odd.  It was a pink light that quickly shot across the sky.  I thought this was odd and even mentioned it to a few people, but thought nothing of it later.  That is until I was surfing the web and saw a picture of the same color and shape of the object I saw on your web page.  It shocked me to see that and just shows me that maybe it isn't always my imagination. ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.

Two unusual objects spotted in the night sky over Fort Lauderdale, FL;2007-06-30 20:50:00;3 minutes;Two unusual objects spotted in the night sky over Fort Lauderdale, FL When walking my dogs, I noticed two unusual objects in the sky over eastern Broward county.  One object appeared to have two lights that toggled back and forth.  Since distance could not be ascertained, I assumed that the lights came from a single object. The lights were white and moved together, slowly, toward the south. Further south, there was a single point of light that appeared to be a separate object.  That light was larger and brighter.  Briefly, a large flare (also white) seemed to follow the object. Although the flare implied speed, as if it were a tail of a comet, the object appeared to be moving slowly. The flare went away after a few seconds.  The objects slowly faded away as I watched them. They remained white and slow moving.  I attempted to shoot a video with my iPhone. The objects are visible but only as a very tiny speck against a black sky.  The lights appeared to be the height that a jet might fly but I had no way to estimate their size, distanc! e, or speed.  I heard no sound other than my dogs. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392

It was about 5,000 feet in the air and really bright The red ball of light stayed with our car as we were watching it to our east. All of a sudden as were staring at this ball of light we see a small orange glow from behind it and the red ball of light disappeared into thin air on a cloudless night.

It was difficult to see which was the actual star. They both were equal in brightness and color. The lower light moved vertically creating a semi -circle around the North Star. It then proceeded Northwest into the sky. The light dimmed as it moved quickly through the sky. It did not move as quick as a shooting star, but it's movement was fast at frist then slowed down.

Two stationary lights off Fort Lauderdale;2010-04-23 19:15:00;20 Minutes;Two stationary lights off Fort Lauderdale I was sitting at restaurant on Fort Lauderdale Beach facing the ocean and saw a stationary white orb over the ocean.  It appeared to be far out to sea. (Eight or ten miles or more.)   At first I assumed it to be an approaching aircraft but it did't move at all which drew my attention. It was completely stationary, which is impossible even for a helicopter.  It was absolutely stationary for about 10 minutes, then another orb appeared as if it were a light being turned on. The second orb was identical to the first and appeared to the right and slightly higher than the first.  They both remained completely stationary in relation to the surface of ocean and to each other. No way these were stars.  It was still light out and slightly hazy and the objects were slightly above the ocean. There were literally thousands of people in and around the beach so others must have seen it.  I took a picture with a hi res SLR camera but the lights were so far out to sea that they look like two white dots then moved on.  A short time later I looked again but the lights were gone. This is the second time I have seen something weird in the sky.  The first was in 1986 or 1987 and that was a completely different object.  Wondering if anyone else on the beach saw these objects.

Multiple events, red/orange lights in S. Forida.;2013-06-09 21:20:00;10;Multiple events, red/orange lights in S. Forida. Multiple events in past 6 mos. Identical conditions in regards to low cloud ceiling. First event, early 2013.  Time approximately 19:30 Looking south towards Miami two orange lights slowly moving east to west. Altitude approximately 250 feet. Distance approximately 1/2 mile. Continued in a western path for five minutes until lights disappeared into low cloud ceiling. Witnesses 3. Second event, June 09 2013 (If I remember correctly).  Time approximately 21:20 Once again, looking south towards Miami 15-20 lights moving west to east.  Altitude approximately 500-700 Ft. Distance approximately 1 1/2 - 2 miles. Although objects were not uniform (IE: triangle), they did not deviate from their own close proximity. If these objects were indeed chinese lanterns then someone had connected them with some sort of string, rope, or cordage, thus allowing a somewhat uniform appearance and movement. As an ex service member I can ensure these objects were not flares, as these object maintained their altitude for approximately 10 minutes before disappearing into the low cloud ceiling. Witnesses 2  Third event, April ? 2013. Looking north from same location. Time approximately 1630. Conditions partly cloudy. A white/light anomaly appeared (other witnesses claim seeing two side by side before I had come outside). Very very strange. Although anomaly appeared close, and conditions of full daylight, I could not gauge distance or altitude. Certainly not low level clouds reflecting sunlight. Still try to rationalize this event in my mind, but I cannot. When reflecting on this event it almost seemed like a dimensional anomaly. I honestly have no way of explaining this event rationally. Witnesses 4  I did not take down exact time, wind, or cloud ceiling conditions because, frankly, I never thought I would be filing a report on them. After hearing a report on Coast to Coast on 25 June 2013 of many events, I figured I should at least make a report on these events. This is coming from someone who has never witnessed any event prior to 2013, so to have 3 events in less than 6 mos is very odd.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392

While driving, I noticed a bright light in the blue sky.  At first it seemed to look like a bright star, while no other stars were visual.  I parked my vehicle just of a curiosity and it was hovering above without a move.  It looked strange and was too bright than a star on a clear sky.  I watch it for 2 minutes and with in this period of time it moved to the left very slowly, then stopped again.   After it took off again and started to move towards SE, I continued to follow it, and then it just disappeared from site.

Large light moving in a pendulum like motion.;2016-03-31 17:30:00;3 minutes;Large light moving in a pendulum like motion I came outside with a friend that was visiting to smoke a cigarette and noticed what I initially though was a very bright and large star.   After looking closer, I realized no other stars were visible because it was quite overcast with clouds that night.  So I'm looking at it trying to figure out whether it was a plane but it was originally not moving at all, just sort of hovering there.   I called my other friend who was visiting to come outside to see what he thought of it.  After he came outside it started maneuvering back and forth from right to left for around a minute.   After the back in forth motion, it started moving back and forth again but this time descending.  The motion this time was kind of odd.  It almost looked like it was a light on a pendulum being lowered.  This motion lasted for around another minute.   Shortly after the light slowly faded out or went behind a cloud and we saw no more of it.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
