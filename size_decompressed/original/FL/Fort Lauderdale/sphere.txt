I was at work as a security guard, driving a patrol car through a residential complex at 4:36 a.m. with my flashing yellow lights on, when something caused me to look out my left window. I looked up and saw a small green orb slowly gliding silently towards the south [I was also driving south]. It was about 1 hundred feet up, and almost overhead. Right after I observed it, it sped up, as if it knew I noticed it. I jumped out of the car, never taking my eyes off of it, and watched it speed off due south, maintaining the same altitude, and traveling in a straight line, until it faded into the distance. It never made the slightest sound, and it glowed a traffic light green color.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
Feel crazy, but true;2004-03-17 22:22:00;45 minutes;Feel crazy, but true Was on vacation in Florida to see a girl I as seeing there.  I am from Chicago, and live in a flight line for Midway airport in Chicago all my life, so I know planes, hellicopters, etc, from other things.  Plus, have spent the last 12 years in Special Forces in the Navy, so I know that too.   We were at the beach late, waiting for the time for my flight out of Ft. Lauderdale, just relaxing and spending time together before I had to leave at 01:30 hours.  We were laid back on one of the life guard tower platforms which are closed and on an angle, unlike those in Chicago, Cali, and other places, where there are stairs.   Anyway, we had not been drinking she was just asking when I would make another trip back.  We were looking east across the ocean, talking and thinking, and that's when a single, orange light caught my eye in the distance.  I asked her, Is that a light house of some kind?  But it did not move at all like one would.   She looked and we stared at it, and she wondered as well.  It appeared to be off the coast about 3 miles, maybe less, maybe more, but from projection, about 500' to 1000' off the surface, perfectly static in station.  We watched for a good ten minutes when a spot light projected across the water.  I thought first, police, because parks and lake fronts in Chicago close at 11:00PM, and we were going to be forced off.   YES...I looked or trailing and guiding lights, there were none.  It moved slowly and quietly towards us and to the south of us and then just went blank.  We looked at each other and laughed, almost dismissing it, until she looked north along the beach and we saw 5, yes five more of them just hanging there, north, off the ocean coast, and yes, the city was still alive, espcially since spring break for colleges in the country was just starting.  They too hung there, quiet, motionless, however, none shown direct light, only an ambient glow.  3 faded out!!!  Just there, then gone, and then approx. a mile or less away, one appeared and then the other.  No speed, no streaks, just there one moment and then gone.   We were freaked.  We walked up the beach a bit to see each one looking at the other in quiet wonder and disbelief.  In 10 minutes they were all gone....no flashing lights, no tail rudder lights, no sounds.  Just there and then nothing.  We spent the next 45 minutes in travel, plus the next days via cell phone conversations asking each other, Did you see what I saw?  We both agreed that we did.   I am not crazy...don't do drugs, quite intelligent, and however I DO believe in other life out there (only a fool would think this would be made for just only us [hence a lot of wasted space]), but I cannot ignore what I saw.  This to me was a change, and when I would read other people's stories about sightings and think they were crazy, well, then I must be just as well.   Take it for what you want, but I was an aero-structural-mechanic in the miitary originally, and did the other thing later...I know aircraft, this was none we have, or anything else.   Well, that's it...I don't know what IS out there, but something more than we are is truly there.  Resubmitting for spelling errors, because when you talk about something most won't believe or be in an agreement of such, well, once types faster than the words can keep up with.  Thanks, ((name deleted)).;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
Crystal sphere no sound over Fort Lauderdale and Miami Airport;2009-09-28 20:05:00;3 minutes;Crystal sphere no sound over Fort Lauderdale and Miami Airport It was 8.05 PM  September 28 2009 when i was outside with my friend next house sitting and smoking when my friend told me look this plane it s not suppose to pass this way.cause we are just by the airport and the runaway go to est-west and no airplane can cross north south or south north it s forbidden. This with light was very bright all around and under not just on the front.It was looking like a big ball of Crystal  We noticed it was moving from NW sky heading SE. It was moving at a steady speed and past just over the Fort Lauderdale airport and crossing the runaway  at maybe around 4 or 5000 feet in a steady slow speed (maybe 100Mph.)the size of the object was almost about half size of a regular commercial air line plane. No noise no green light no red light no withe strobe.  Something strange there s normally always many airplanes around that we can see  but during all the time about 3 minutes that this object was passing  there was no airplane around son after this object reach this ocean  we can see many airplane come back  around again. It was like if they were advise to not come around during the object was passing. Thanks for reading.  Jack scott    Here a copy of somebody who saw the same thing of me 10 minutes after over the Miami airport.    At approximately 8:15PM on 9/28/09 I walked out and as usual I looked up into the evening sky.  I observed a very bright light in the northeastern sky moving in a southerly direction. What made this unusual was the fact of how bright the light was. My first impression that is was an aircraft, since I live about 6 miles from the Miami International Airport. The best description of intensity of the light that I can describe is that of Venus in the night sky.  As I looked at it more closely, I could see no navigational markers (red, green or flashing strobe) visible. During the duration of the sighting I heard no noise from the object.  The speed of the object was that of a jet flying at altitude, but the altitude was much lower, maybe 10000 ft (but that is just a guess since it was difficult to determine since it was dark).  Living as close to the airport as I do, I am familiar with the flight patterns of aircraft. This object appeared to fly directly over Miami International Airport which is unusual again based on the objects apparent altitude. Another oddity observed was during the sighting no aircraft were visible either landing or taking off.  The object continued on its southerly course and made a turn to the east. Even when it made its turn the intensity of the light remained constant. IF it had been an aircraft I would have noticed its national markers. One other note was as I watched it make its easterly turn I noticed an aircraft to the southeast and its navigational beacons where quite visible. Once it made its turn, I moved to follow the object but lost it between tress and other houses.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392

Orange light, occasionally blinking.;2016-10-30 21:00:00;7 seconds;Orange light, occasionally blinking. Sitting in my backyard at night while on my laptop (computer), facing towards the west, I noticed an orange sphere.  It flew in a straight line & occasionally it would start blinking. It looked like an aircraft navigation light, however I thought it was odd that it clearly was orange & not red.  It so happened that I was about to read reports on NUFORC & read that there were other reports in our state of orange lights/spheres.  If I had read these reports before seeing the orange light, I would have watched it longer.  But again, it was not a red navigation light it was clearly orange like orange fruit, & I could see other red navigation lights to reference as there were multiple aircraft in the area. I just wanted to point out that I'm an Air Force veteran & have witnessed the triangle UFO & I have witnessed a green fireball.  Both incidences included multiple witnesses.  This orange light incident however was not as vivid & clear and therefore, it may have been an actual aircraft however, I believe that taking the other similar sightings into consideration, that for a few reasons it would be better to report this incident.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392

Spheres off of wing.;2018-04-17 09:00:00;10 seconds;Spheres off of wing Flying from BWI to FLL.  On downwind for 10L, aboard Spirit flight 301.  I was sitting at a window seat just enjoying as always (I fly a lot) and I noticed something off of our left wing. First thought it was a drone.  This thing was about 20 feet off the wing. There was some forward motion to it  because we didn't pass it quickly. It was a small sphere with two smaller things next to it. Then it just went away, not disappeared but just went away.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
