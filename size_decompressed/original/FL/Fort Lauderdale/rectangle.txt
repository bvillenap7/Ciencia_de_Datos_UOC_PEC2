Huge ship splits in 2,,, FT LAUDERDALE;2020-03-08 00:00:00;4 minutes;Huge ship splits in 2,,, FT LAUDERDALE A huge rectangle  like ship was in the clouds hovering over downtown Fort Lauderdale with heat waves surrounding it.  There were torch flames coming out of each corner on the bottom, I looked away for a second and when I looked back it split in the middle into two crafts one heading West and the other North East towards the beach.  The crafts both dissipated in the sky moving very slowly. 2 mins later a fire ball was just floating across the street in the neighbors backyard...  I couldnâ€™t believe what I was seeing.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
