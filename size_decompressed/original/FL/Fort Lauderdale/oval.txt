shiny metallic oval object over the everglades;2003-02-15 15:37:00;1 minute;shiny metallic oval object over the everglades we were returning from Miami via I-75 heading north back to Ft. Lauderdale, my husband was driving and I was looking out of the windows at the airplanes.  I noticed a small very shiny, silverish metallic object somewhat of an oval maybe even a little oblong hovering very high in sky over the everglades. I mentioned it to my husband and continued to watch it for for about 30 seconds when suddenly it accelerated and took off in a westernly direction at an extremely high speed I followed it for about another 30 seconds before it dissappeared.  This object was extremely high in the sky, alot higher than airplanes that I have seen and it also went from just being stationary to moving quite fast. There were regular commercial airplanes in the sky at the time coming into ft. lauderdale airport and not many clouds in the sky at the time. I do not know if it qualifies as an ufo but it did not seem like any other plane I have ever witnessed.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392

No engine noise, flashing raspberry and white colored lights.  I left and returned an hour later.  The same aircraft is still hovering but further away, over the atlantic.  It still was not moving in any particular direction, just hovering.  Not lit like any other aircraft i've ever seen.  It appears is could be actually spinning.

Large oval on its side with orange bands of light.;2015-05-07 23:25:00;15 minutes;large oval on its side with orange bands of light. At approximately 11:25 p.m., I observed a very large object off the coast, due east of my location.  It was approximately the size of a full moon.  It looked to hold a constant altitude and was slowly moving north to south.  It was shaped like an oval on its side and had bright burnt orange light emanating from it.   The bands of light were roughly vertical and were moving from left to right on the object.  The light seemed to bend, with the ends of each band curving towards the center.  When the light bands were towards the left side of the object, the ends bent to the right.  When the lights had rotated to the right side of the object, the bands bent to the left.  As the light bands reached towards the center of the object they appeared vertical.   It was observed during the beginning of a lightning storm a few miles off the coast, just about where the Gulf Stream scoops and towards the coast.  After maybe 15 minutes it quickly faded and the disappeared, possibly into ! the clouds.  Shortly thereafter I heard choppers but saw no lights.  Very strange for around here as we have a lot of air traffic and to run without lights would be extremely risky.   I tried to snap a picture but considering it was with the camera phone the quality is very poor. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the source of this report, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.

Oval, red white alternating colors.;2019-01-10 22:30:00;1 minute;Oval, red white alternating colors On Jan 10, 2019.  20 miles off the coast of Florida, near the F.t Lauderdale airport.  Myself and my coworker saw a UFO about 3 miles off the port bow.  It did not show up on radar. Amazingly, I got to see it with binoculars.  It was approx 30 to 40 feet tall and 20-ish wide.  Ovalish in shape.  With red and white alternating colors on its hull.  I saw it descend, rise, and hover.  Then move out of range from a large object to a pin prick and gone in less than a second.  Anything moving that fast couldn't possibly be manned.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
