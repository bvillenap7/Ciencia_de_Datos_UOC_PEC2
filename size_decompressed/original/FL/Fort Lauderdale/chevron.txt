Chevron Wedge of approx. 20 small luminescent disks in actuality one large individual UFO with round running lights below.;1977-12-03 00:50:00;Seven Minutes;Chevron Wedge of approx. 20 small luminescent disks in actuality one large individual UFO with round running lights below. Telescope observation. Full moon three major planets. Orion high. Paused for clearing eye. Looking towards the east [Ft. Lauderdale beach]at Lupus constellation. Slow rising wege [reverse chevron configuration]. Approx. 20 small round luminescent discs [one out of formation]visible, rising from east in slow arc towards Orion constellation. Unaware of height in night sky - meteor burn below chevron-shape cluster of discs [disc-circles small as smaller floppy-disk circle]. Height estimated above 100,000 ft. Chevron wedge of disc-light flight takes them across first two stars of Orion belt, and stars disappear behind chevron wedge shadow [the dark space between, and surrounding disc-lights]! Lights thought to be many objects, now appear to be one large object [by large...meaning enormous - like small satellite moon!]. Arc of flight continues past zenith until object falls off sky as would an object outside Earth's atmosphere! Contacted Jimmy Carter Washington telephone number to report sighting received confirmation as being one of four sighters at 1:10 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. [repeated particulars of sighting to both callers]. Received e-mail from stranger a few years ago [around 1995] from viewer in boat out at sea that smae night who reported to me that he not only saw the same object as I, but another smaller craft from larger one which buzzed Ft. Lauderdale beach, and caused small Piper Cub type aircraft to crash, killing dentist and family! Could not corroborate my sighting because of problem with his party whose members did not wish to be identified as being where they were at the time! Was told by Professor Hynek [the 6:30 a.m. call from California] that my sighting was one of Mother-Ship first seen in 1888 and then again in 1950. ((NUFORC Note:  We will attempt to establish whether the date is exact, or approximate.  We will invite the witness to locate the article of the crashed aircraft.

Very large V-shaped object. blended in with sky seemed to float in direction headed W.  Seemed low to ground.;2012-01-03 03:00:00;5 minutes;very large v shaped object. blended in with sky seemed to float in direction  headed west seemed low to ground. . I am not sure of the date, but I do remember it was late at night, 3am.  The craft was huge and made no sound or maybe a humming.  When I first saw it I was probably only seeing the wing of it.It was north of me,moving towards the west.  There seemed to be light in the front of the right wing.  Not a light like on a plane.  It was more like a glow.  I also thought I saw  piping in the shape of coils in an octagon shape taking up most of the space on what could be called the right wing.  Again, it all was hard to see because it was the color of the night sky.It almost looked transparent.  As it got further away, I it looked like a v standing upright, just floating away till it was too far away to see.  I saw no  blinking lights or heard no engine sounds.  The object was large enough to take up most of the sky line when it was directly north of me.  It seemed to be moving slowly.  As it moved to my right I saw the back of it.  It was just black and thin.  In the shape of a v.  It seemed to be very low in the sky.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
A giant wing shaped object, little slower than the typical passenger jets that fly over regularly. No lights or sound at all.;2012-09-28 21:30:00;45 seconds;A giant wing shaped object, little slower than the typical passenger jets that fly over regularly. No lights or sound at all. It went from one cloud bank across the clear black sky into another cloud bank.  Lasted about 45 very long seconds.  Was shaped more like giant boomerang.  It was about the same color as the clouds that night.  I have no idea what is was...but it was such an incredible sight.  We could tell it was much higher than an airplane.  It was minimum 20 times the wingspan of a 747.  That's what was so shocking about it.  It seemed to be fuzzy around the edges...like a cloud...but unmistakably not a cloud. It was a giant wing shaped object...traveling a little slower than the typical passenger jets that fly over regularly. No lights at all...no sound. I found a couple picture on the internet that match it perfectly.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
Silver chevron object in clear blue sky over Fort Lauderdale at 5 pm in afternoon.;2014-06-05 17:00:00;30 seconds;Silver Chevron Object in clear blue sky over Fort Lauderdale at 5 pm in afternoon. I was heading South on Federal Highway, US1 at the junction of Bayview Drive and I spotted a silver object in the sky ahead of me.  I watched it and followed it for approx. 30 seconds.   It was travelling quickly but was not really high in the sky.   All of a sudden it just vanished. It all happened very quickly and I was in my car at the time.  Traffic was somewhat heavy but moving, others must have seen it. I am a married businessman in my mid forties, quite sane & not a tin foil hat wearer, but I know what I saw.   I wish I could have taken a photo.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
2 sightings of small discs flying in v-formation 15-20 minutes apart.;2015-10-03 22:30:00;2 separate, 15 min apart.;2 sightings of small discs flying in v-formation 15-20 minutes apart. Approx. 1 block west of US-1.  Approximately a dozen smaller discs flying in v-formation, no sound made at low altitude (under 1k feet).  Came into vision and passed overhead out of sight.  Approximately 15-20 min later, same shape, same duration at slightly higher altitude just further east.  Dim lighting around crafts during each episode.   Observers were sitting on a 7th floor patio at apartments near 6th street and 4th avenue (one block west of US-1), facing northward.  Objects were moving north to south, and passed out of site over our heads and beyond the building where we sat.
