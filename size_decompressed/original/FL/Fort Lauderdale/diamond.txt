Three adults observe 2 two tiny white rectangle, or rhomboids just above horizon over ocean.  Objs. descend, rise.  2nd sighting.;1996-02-26 12:20:00;2 hrs.;Man reports witnessing two small squares, rectangles, or rhomboids hovering for extended periods of time to the east of Ft. Lauderdale over the Atlantic Ocean.  During his second sighting of the objects on the day of his call, he was observing them from Deerfield Beach at a magnetic bearing of approximately 80-90 degrees magnetic, and approximately 5 degrees above the horizon.  They appeared to him to be two white dots when he first noticed them.  When he looked at them with 6-power binoculars, they appeared to be rectangles, canted at an angle.  The objects would rise and fall (relative to the horizon), relative to each other. He also witnessed the objects on Saturday, 24FE96, when he observed two of them at 90 degrees magnetic heading, and two more at approximately 120 degrees magnetic.   Two other individuals, one 87 years old, the other 95, witnessed the objects through binoculars. Caller estimated the objects were 9 or 10 miles distant from his vantage on the beach.  He will submit a report in future weeks when he returns to his home in Dallas.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
