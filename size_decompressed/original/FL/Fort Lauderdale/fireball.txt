The window was on the north side of the house.  It was decending at approximately 45 degrees angle east to west, it was huge and around the circumference was seeming low flames with a fiery trail.  It reminded me of the huge special effects of the meteor that carried the space craft in the original War  of the Worlds movie.  It was eerie looking,  I was so excited I shouted for my wife to come a see.  By the time she awoke and got to the window it passed from sight.  I called the Ft. Lauderdale International Airport Control Tower and asked if they saw the object.  The person that answered said No.  I the called Channel 7 news room and a guy answered, I told him what I saw, he replied that he had not heard of anything.  I asked him if he did would he call me back and I gave him my telephone number.  I thought he was just humoring me when he said he would, but when the phone rang about 15 minutes later it was this fellow at the TV station telling me that the report was coming over the AP wire and that the object had been spotted as far north as Gainsville. He asked me to descibe what I saw again, I did, he thanked me and we hung up.  I could hardly sleep and stayed up most of the night.  The next day I was impatiently waiting for the news reports to come out about the sighting, but I personally never heard anything about it. Someone said something about a falling satelite or some other nonsense. That vision will never leave me.  This evening I discovered your Reporting center and curiosity drove me to find the report which had to be one in the sighting.  I was stunned to finally see a report by someone else that seemingly corroborates what I saw.  That report was posted 6/2/98 and the location was Hamton, Virginia Beach Amusment Park, VA. The report by a photgrapher. I've waited 28 years to tell this, boy it feels good! Thanks. Round meteor with flame and trail,  decending as if it were a controlled decent.  The color was Orange/red and bright.  It did not move like a falling star or a burning up satellite or a meteor burning up in our atmosphere.  It was too huge and too controlled.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392

On the eve of 7/29/01 I witnessed a huge fireball fly accross the sky while driving So. on a Ft, Lauderdale Florida road.;2001-07-29 23:50:00;5 seconds;On the eve of 7/29/01 I witnessed a huge fireball fly accross the sky while driving So. on a Ft, Lauderdale Florida road. I was driving South on a major roadway in Fort Lauderdale at approximately 23:45 on Saturday, July 29, 2001. In an instant, something caught the attention of my sight in the lower sky just above eye level. I witnessed a large object on fire with a trail of fire behind it shoot accross the sky. At first I thought it was a plane crashing to earth. The 3-5 second span that this object took to fly accross the whole sky canceled this theory. I then braced myself to feel the effect of the impact of such a large object falling towards the earth at such velocity. There was nothing. However, I knew there was Something!!!!!!! This Something I cannot explain. Can you help me???????!!!!!!!!!!;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
Reentry Object in northern sky 4/15 20:47 PM - Duration about 45 seconds ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2004-04-15 20:47:00;1 minute;Reentry Object in northern sky 4/15 20:47 PM - Duration about 45 seconds Just observed some kind of object/vehice enter into the atmosphere in the northern sky from 8:47 - 8:48 PM. We were traveling north on Flamingo Road north of Griffin Road near Fort Lauderdale, approaching Flamingo Gardens. Noticed a bright orange/red glow, stationary at about 35-40 degrees above the horizon, just above the tree line as seen from the road. Size made it appear to be an aircraft beacon but more orange/pink in color than a red beacon. The other problem is there is no beacon in the vicinity.  This object was apparently motionless but after about 15 seconds a long tail of flame appeared behind the object, indicating that it was entering the atmosphere from the north, thus the bright reddish glow and tail. The tail lasted about five seconds after which the object began to fade steadily and it turned to the east at a high altitude at a rapid speed, that of a fast jet. There were no aircraft style lights or beacons from the object. It faded in intensity after it turned east.  This unnerved me since I have never seen anything like this, and the apparent direction was from the north, which would be a strange direction of reentry for a typical spacecraft.  I am familiar with meteorites, which at the rate of speed on entry, streak across the sky in about 1 second. This episode lasted the better part of a minute and was obviously not a meteorite. I wonder if you have any information on this episode that you can share. A driver behind me also pulled over to observe this object. Whatever it is, the sight was extremely unusual and compelling. My daughter was with in the car and saw the object as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392

Burning fireball shoots through northern sky over Florida;2007-02-25 23:00:00;5 seconds;Burning fireball shoots through northern sky over Florida My bf and I were walking back to our hotel at approximately 11:00 at nite when I saw what looked like a fireball with a glowing, burning tail trailing behind it flying through the sky at a very fast speed. I pointed it out and asked him what it was because I knew it was not a plane but it seemed too large and bright to be a shooting star.  He replied he did not know and we ran to keep watching it as it disappeared behind the view of building but it was gone.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
Fort Lauderdale streaking light.;2008-12-18 16:59:00;5 seconds;Fort Lauderdale streaking light. I was walking along US 1 before the Las Olas intersection, and saw a bright streak of light moving horizontally towards Fort Lauderdale airport.  It was a greenish hue, and was moving very fast.   I've seen many jet fighters, but this was moving far faster than anything I've ever seen.   I couldn't hear any noise.

Orange Fire Balls headed East over Atlantic Ocean;2008-12-31 21:30:00;3 minutes;Orange Fire Balls headed East over Atlantic Ocean Two low flying fire balls traveled from the Northwest in an Easterly direction out to the Atlantic Ocean.  The approximated altitude is estimated at 5000 feet and climbing intot he atmosphere as it approached the ocean.  The orange-colored fireballs took approximately 3 minutes to travel the entire landscape over me.  The lights discipated as they distanced over the ocean.  It was very difficult to focus on the objects.  They traveled in nearly identical patterns.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392

We saw a fireball? hot lava colored fireball orb like object rising from what appeared  to be the ground and coming toward us.  I had droped my camera or I could have gotten a good picture of it.  I didn't want to take my eyes off of it.  It seemed to have spike like objects coming out of it as it passed over the car.  I lost sight of it after it passed over the car.  It seemed quite large going over us.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
Orange &quotfireball&quot colored light no noise moving W to E South of FLL.;2013-07-24 21:00:00;2 minutes;Orange &quotfireball&quot colored light no noise moving W to E South of FLL Looking south from Ft Lauderdale in the direction of FLL I noticed the light because of the dark orange fire looking color.  After focusing on on it, I can describe that it looked like the upper part of it was more white in color and was shaped like a triangle or jib sail and was a darker fire looking color towards the center. At first it appeared to be moving North but as it got closer, it seems, it was moving pretty much due east.  The object light was pulsating in a random pattern like a fire would do.  As it moved west it resembled what a rocket looks like traveling away from.  The speed seemed to be no more than what a typical airliner travels.  There was no trail and never any noise that I could hear. I have no way to tell the distance from my vantage.  I can say that I could never get a defined shape as it was a bit fuzzy looking.  I did take two photos though.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392

We saw a total of 7 red/ orange lights.  We were facing N, and they were coming from the NE towards the SW.

The first group were 2 running parallel and a smaller one following suit.  The 2 running parallel, the one on the left veered slightly to the west, and shot straight up into a little puffy cloud to never to be seen.  The one running parrellel with it moved in a similar direction about thirty seconds after the first to shoot up into a cloud to never be seen.  The third one following which seemed to be smaller, about thirty seconds after seemed to follow the other two in the same direction never to be seen.  The next set were four of the same color lights, no particular formation, did the same pattern one by one and disappeared, maybe 10 seconds between each, never to be seen again.  These were definitely not planes, drones, weather balloons etc.  We found it interesting and have noticed 2 other posts that saw similar lights.
