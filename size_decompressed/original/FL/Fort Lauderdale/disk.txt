The craft hovered directly over a resturant called pier 66 about 50 to 100 feet above it.;1975-03-07 19:00:00;10 minutes;The craft hovered directly over a resturant called pier 66 about 50 to 100 feet above it. It's been many years and I'm not even sure if I have the right year , month and time but once I tell you of the sighting it may coincide with another report of the same sighting if someone else reported it. I know there were others that saw it because several years ago someone I met mentioned that thy knew someone that saw the same thing as I. It was a craft that was heading south over the intercoastal waterway in ft lauderdale. It looked like a bright light, kinda like a headlight on a plane. A friend and I were traveling east over the intercoastal on 17 st .Looking north I saw this thing and said to my friend, What the heck is that  ? I was driving so it was a little tricky for me to keep my eyes on it . Suddenly in a flash it moved to a different locaion which was directly above a resturant called Pier 66. Funny thing about this resturant is that it rotates , or at least it used to and it looks like a round ufo .Pier 66 is like 10 stories high so it looks like a space ship on top of a building. This made us think that whoever was in the ufo might have looked at the building because it really looks like a saucer shaped craft. Anyway when we were going over the bridge the ufo was roughly the same size as the top of the pier 66 round building and it hovered what looked to be something like 50 to 100 ft above it. It was there for just seconds then it traveled across the sky to a distant location (in a split second) to a point that it looked as small as a star. Then in a split second again it traveled to the top of pier 66 and hovered above it again.Let me tell you this all happened so fast that we were still crossing over the bridge when this happened. Once we crossed the bridge we were heading east towards the ocean and then the craft started to move slowly east . It flew at a slow speed so we were able to watch it as we headed towards the beach.I could only glance at it from time to time because I was driving.My friend was watching it all the way .It flew at an angle and had some what I seem to remember red lights at the bottom. ( my friend drew a picture of it that year , he is an excelent artist ). Once we got to the ocean I was trying to pull over into a parking area on the beach so I could stop driving and just concentrate on looking at this thing. I pulled over and the craft was just crossing over the road A1A and heading over the ocean. It got over the water and again it a split second traveled across the sky to the point that it looked like a tiny star in the distance and just as fast came right back to the same spot it was just at. Then it slowly started moving east again over the ocean and then there was a big flash of different colors at it was gone. I wish I could remember the exact date and time but I never wrote it down. I hope someone else has reported this sighting so I can have more eyewitness accounts of it. This sighting made me want to see another one but to this date that was the last time I saw one.  I know more people saw this. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
Classic flying saucer moving low and slow through condos in gated Ft. Lauderdale prestige golf community.;1976-07-28 03:30:00;15 minutes;Classic flying saucer moving low and slow through condos in gated Ft. Lauderdale prestige golf community. I lived on the 6th floor of a condominium in a gated, private golf community.  It had a balcony that faced (what I remember may be) Commercial Blvd. in Ft. Lauderdale.  I had gone out on the balconey (as was my habit) to watch a boyfriend drive out of the complex on his way home in the early morning hours.  It was a beautiful and clear night.  As I hung over the balconey watching for the boyfriend's tail-lights (which he'd tap to say goodbye), I heard a very low, throbbing sound to the back and right side of the building.  I had a good view of the space between the condos nearest me and I peered around the corner.  I saw a craft, which I at first thought was some kind of advertising thing-- because lights were revolving around the mid-section slowly, like a marquee of some kind.  It also was bathed from the top and bottom by soft red and green light-- I cannot remember at this time which color was at the top or at the bottom, red or green. But those were the two colors.  As it moved between the buildings, very, very, slowly, I saw it was, well, a saucer.  An honest-to-God flying saucer.  It was no more than 75 feet from me on the balcony. It was so close that I could see the windows.  It was dull, gray metallic looking and seamless.  It had a dome-shape on both top and underside.  It was well-proportioned. It had windows or ports encircling the middle circumference that revolved slowly.  I could not see into these windows as the light seemed to be opaque.  The windows were similar to, I guess, airliner windows rounded at the corners, appearing to be slightly recessed.  The light was not bright, but not glowing, either, possibly a little bit fuzzy.  They revolved slowly and clockwise.  The red and green glow(s) at the top and the undersurface pulsed, but only slightly.  The sound it made I have best described as a low warbling of two tones.  I couldn't take my eyes off it, of course.  I was trying to believe what I was seeing.  It continued over the grounds moving south, and the thing that freaks me out to this day is that it started to follow the exact same road my boyfriend was traveling on out of the complex.  It was pretty much right behind him.  I thought, He MUST be able to see this thing, it's right on his tail. This was BEFORE cell phones...  I lost sight of the road out after a few minutes and couldn't figure out if the craft had left the area over the road, but I think it did as it got closer to what I THINK was Commercial Blvd.  At that point it quickly gained altitude, like pretty much straight up into the air.  It didn't go up slowly, but just popped up like a balloon on a string you let go of, and then took off quickly southwest.  I called the Ft. Lauderdale police immediately and asked if anyone had reported a UFO in the area around Environ.  They simply said, no.  I didn't make a report, I just said thanks and figured I'd read something in the paper the next day.  I didn't see anything reported, however.  I told my boyfriend the next day and he said he wasn't looking up and behind him, and didn't notice any lights other than his on the road.  But, the craft didn't have beams shining down on anything, anyway.  The road was fairly well-lit with those orang-y lights.  He believed me.  I'm a sober, logical, well-educated and intelligent person, not very excitable, either.  I took the experience in stride.  I know I saw what looked like the classic flying saucer, and that's as simple as it is.  I don't know if anyone else saw the same one I saw, but I can't believe I was the only person awake in a great big complex such as the one I lived in at the time.  This sighting was smack dab in the middle of an extremely well-populated and popular area.  It still makes me wonder why, if this was an extra-terrestrial craft, why it would chose to show itself so low to the ground and in a place where it could expect to be seen clearly if anyone looked out a window or was walking a dog.  I've told other people in a matter-of-fact way exactly what I saw.  I never thought to find a website like this to report to until I finally got mad at the zillionith TV program about UFOs STILL with no explanation about similar sightings and went out to find a place to report my experience to add to all the others.  I'd like an explanation for what I saw, please. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
Slow moving classic disc 50ft up;1976-07-28 21:00:00;8 minutes;Slow moving classic disc 50ft up Date is approximate(I chose this date as a very similiar report has this date) also actual city was West Hollywood which is a surrounding area of Fort Lauderdale. I was about 12 or 13 at the time.  I was riding my bicycle up and down the street in our apartment complex, which was approx. 1/3 of a mile long.  From the North end of the street a classic flying saucer came hovering over the tree line about 40 to 60 feet high. It was like right out of the movies, a metallic disc with colored lights rotating around it (I'm colorblind so sorry I can't tell you the colors).  Diameter was about 30 to 40 feet, 10 to 15 feet in height symetrical top and bottom.  It made no noise. At the time I was not scared, but only interested and I followed it from one end of the street to the other.  I literally road my bicycle under it the entire length of the street (1/3 mile) which it strangely hovered directly over seeming to follow the road.  I was easily able to keep pace with it so I estimate its speed at no more than 15 MPH.  At the end of our street I stopped and watched it continue on at the same pace.  Because of its low altitude it disappeared from view before to long. At that time the Goodyear blimp was a regular sight in Lauderdale and TV/movies portrayed UFO exactly like this one so even at that young age I was skeptical, thinking that this was to good to be true.  I figured I would hear of a hoax or some explanation.  That never happened.  Now as I've grown older I realize the importance and significance of such a clear and close sighting.  I will try to send(email) more info(map and illustration), Thanx ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
Two saucer shaped faintly glowing objects side by side silently going north over Ft. Lauderdale on 11/18/01 at 4:22;2001-11-18 04:22:00;45 seconds;Two saucer shaped faintly glowing objects side by side silently going north over Ft. Lauderdale on 11/18/01 at 4:22 I was sitting on the roof deck of my house watching the Leonid Meteorite Shower.  It was 4:22. I remember because I thought I was seeing two pelicans flying just to the south of me and looked at the clock to see what time it was.  I had never seen pelicans at 4:00 in the morning and 8 miles inland. I could not take my eyes off them and as they came closer I noticed a faint bluish glow to them.  We live in the path of airplanes coming and going from Ft. Lauderdale Airport.  These were not on any of those paths, but were flying at what seemed to be about the same altitude of a plane coming in for a landing. They were coming from the South and headed northeast after they went passed over me.  They were silent, not moving at a tremendously fast rate of speed, it was more like two friends just out cruising the sky together.  But, the part I will never forget was when they got just north east of my view, just before they went out of my sight, the one on the right sort of scooped underneath the other one and back out as if they were playing, or saying, We see you too.  Bye, now.  It was the most awsome thing.  I will never forget it.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
Object Seen In Florida;2007-08-19 03:30:00;2min;Object Seen In Florida We were on our way to the HardRock Casino.  We parked on the top of the garage...the very top level.  We were about to get out of the car when we  looked up in the sky and at first I saw a light.  It was a clear night.  We noticed it was not a plane and it was not a star.  At first it was hovering in the air, then it became clear to see it was an object and it had a shape. It started to move left to right and back and forth for a few seconds...then it disappeared behind a cloud.  Then it came from behind the clound.  It was dark ...its shape was like a saucer.  I tried to reach in the back seat of the car to get the video camera, but as soon as I was about to press the record button...the object started to leave.  It was very visable until we got the camera out.  It seemed to fade away after I was about to get it on video.  Then it took off at an unblievable speed.  At that exact moment, it started to thunder and rain.  From the same cloud it disappeared behind, came a lightening.  It only rained for only about one minute.  Its rare for it to rain in Florida at that time of day. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
3 UFOs seen around Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA.;2008-09-15 19:39:00;2 minutes;3 UFOs seen around Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA. Yesterday, 15-Sep-2008, at 7:30 pm EST, I was out in Fort Lauderdale's State Route A1A and Las Olas Blvd. beach, more precisely at Lat 26°6'49N and Lon 80°6'17W, getting ready to photograph the rising of the moon expected to happen from that point at Altitude 14.3° and Azimuth 93.1° E of N.  The sun at that time and location was at Altitude -17.7° and Azimuth 281.8° E of N. Slightly north of the moon's expected rising point, at about 80° to 75°Azimuth, I saw what at first I thought were Venus and Mercury in a formation I saw two years ago in Bogotá, Colombia, when Mercury was seen above and to the left of Venus in the city's southern night sky.  Yesterday's Venus, however, was unusually large, round and bright, and Mercury moved quickly in an up-and-to-the-left motion, right before I aimed my Sony DSC-F828 camera towards my planets and took several pictures, e-mailing separately:  DSC00066: At 7:39 pm Venus is bright and clear above a cloud formation that has two horn-like extensions on top.  Mercury is no longer white, it is now a yellow moving element as it moves away quickly in an up-and-to-the-left motion from its previous position above Venus.  Neither Venus nor Mercury have strobe red and bluish-white lights which would identify them as commercial aircraft, approaching FLL's international airport.  At the lower-left, another yellow light is seen. DSC00067: Still at 7:39 pm, Venus is at its same position above the cloud and the yellow light from DSC00066's lower-left area begins to move rapidly in an upward direction. DSC00068: Still at 7:39 pm, I zoom in into Venus and my camera's automatic focus, without clear referencing points, blurs the picture. DSC00069: Now at 7:40 pm, I still cannot get my camera to focus correctly, Venus has not moved from its original position. DSC00070: Still at 7:40 pm, I zoom out as Venus shoots up and to the left, caught here emitting white light from its bottom and yellow light from its top.  Two small lights to its right and one more small white light to its left suggest a wide, round, dish-like aircraft, producing a powerful white radiant light from its bottom and two also strong lights from its top. DSC00071: Still at 7:40 pm, Venus holds still before disappearing in a fast, upward motion. DSC00072: At 7:41 pm, that is the moon.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392

Moved from ocean beach area 1500 feet above surface in North/Northeasterly direction at speed of around 60 MPH.  Color ended above my head and became a circular craft with faint lights around the entire base.   My wife and I saw another one almost exactly 1 year ago 1000 feet above the surface which was triangular.  Neither craft emitted any sound whatsoever and both were directly above our heads.

Glowing baby blue disk ascending from the clouds, witnessed by 3-4 and photographed;2014-06-24 19:00:00;5 minutes;Glowing baby blue disk ascending from the clouds, witnessed by 3-4 and photographed On june 24th, 2014, I witnessed a craft ascending within a cloud formation. This movement created what looked like a cloud table on which the UFO sat atop. The UFO was glowing a solid baby blue color, much like a florescent bulb. The craft was not flashing, but remained illuminated at all times. As the craft ascended, the cloud formation below it grew in size. The craft was also illuminating the clouds above it, proving that it was resting in-between the clouds. After about 3 minutes, the craft slid sideways from the cloud table, exposing itself for about a 30-60 seconds and then disappeared in a blink. I was able to take 2 decent photos of the incident, although the color does not appear in the photos as it did in person.  I am a non drinking, non drugging, 44 year old medical college student and business owner. Also witnessed by 2-3 valet/parking attendants who were trying to talk themselves out of what they had seen.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
