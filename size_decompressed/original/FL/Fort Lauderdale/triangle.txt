3 star, triangle formation, moved overhead, created spark, moved back out in direction it came from.;1999-03-16 13:00:00;2 minutes;3 star, triangle formation, moved overhead, created spark, moved back out in direction it came from. I could not enter the time appropriately.  The system would not let me enter it.  This happened at 8:35 p.m. above a Hotel swimming pool, in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.  I was there attending a NAMES Project seminar (AIDS memorial quilt) and the last class of the day had ended prior.  Everyone else in my group went out for the night, I opted to stay at the hotel, swim and eat.  It was evening and I was alone in the pool.   At the far end of the pool, was a bar with bartender and a man and woman having drinks.  They were the length of the pool plus some away from me, they were on stools, laughing and talking with their backs turned from me slightly.  They were under a canope and could not see the sky from where they sat.  I had done a few laps and was leaning up against the shallow end of the pool, looking up at the sky.  There were other hotels on either side of me.  If I looked directly up and a little to either side I could sky..until seeing the next tall hotel building.  Perhaps you are familiar with this strip of hotels along the beach.  Anyway, I was leaning back against the back of the pool, relaxing and looking up.  Mind you, I don't drink and see well at night.  I need glasses for seeing up close at night, but I could see the stars just fine.  I noticed, suddenly, to my right (the direction of the beach)  there was were 3 stars moving in an exact triangle shape above my head.  TO describe their pattern it would be two on the left and one on the right... so that it made a triange shape.  I hope that makes sense.   I watched them move across above my head, slowly until the shape was directly over my head above.  I remember thinking my gosh, look at that.. and I looked down at the people at the end of the pool and looked back up again thinking.. if I stop and call them, I may miss this.  I want to see what this is...   Anyway, the triangle formation (the star looking objects) stopped then (it was almost as if I knew it was going to do this before it happened) the two stars on the left came together and touched briefly, made a slight spark and then went back into the original triangle shape.  Then slowly moved back off the right, the direction it originally came in.. until it disappeared over the hotel roof tops.   It was not a solid craft, but three distinct stars for want of a better word, that were travelling, slowly, in a triangle shape.  There was no sound associated with this at all.  When I told my friends of this the next morning, they say ya, right ((name deleted)), were you wearing your glasses?.  What I am wondering, is was there any other report of this being seen, in March in 1999 in that area?  I can't have been the only one looking up in the sky that night and seeing this..  What I didn't realize is how close Fort Lauderdale is to the Bermuda Triangle.  I hear things like this happen a lot in that area.  Anyway, I live in Salt Lake City and have only been to Florida that one time.  I have wanted to have someone document this.  Thank you and if you need further information from me, feel free to e-mail me via this site.  Thank you. ((name deleted));26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
Small triangular objects seen near i-595 in fort lauderdale floating.;2001-02-05 11:00:00;20 sec.;Small triangular objects seen near i-595 in fort lauderdale floating. I Was driving on I-595 when I saw a strange triangle shaped object with 3-4 lights on it.  I would guess that it was 75-100 ft in the air, I thought it might be a light pole top but as I got closer I could see that it was just hovering.  I slowed down and it stayed there even as I passed it.  Then I saw anther closer to the airport in the distance and thought maybe they were planes but neither was moving.  I thought maybe they were helicopters hovering but they usually have blinking lights and make a little noise but I didnt hear anything.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
Sighting of 3 lights in northern sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Titan 4 launch from Cape Canaveral.  PD));2003-09-09 00:30:00;1 TO 2 MINUTES;((NUFORC Note:  A launch of a Titan 4 rocket from Cape Canaveral  was conducted at 00:29 hrs. on this date.  We suspect that the launch was the cause of the several reports NUFORC received from multiple points in Florida.  We post the reports to illustrate how easy it is to misidentify a relatively commonplace event.  Even we were intrigued by the reports, when they first were submitted, and it took us approximately 12 hours to identify the apparent source of the reports.  PD)) MY FIANCE, HER MOTHER AND MYSELFWERE DRIVING BACK FROM DINNER AND GOING NORTH ON I 95 AROUND EXIT 15 AROUND FORT LAUDERDALE FLORIDA.

THESE LIGHTS APPEARED TO HOVER IN A TRIANGULAR FORMATION FAINTING AGAIN INTO THE CLOUDS. I AM A PHYSICIAN AND WAS TAKEN BACK AT THIS SIGHT. MY FIANCE ALSO COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT SHE SAW. MY FIANCE MOTHER IS AN ARCHITECT KEPT ASKING FOR THE CAMERA.  HOWEVER BY THE TIME I WAS ABLE TO FIND IT, ABOUT TWO MINUTES ELAPSED AND THE EVENT IN THE SKY DISSAPEARED.

It had no running lights and did not make a sound.;2003-09-24 20:00:00;2 minutes;It had no running lights and did not make a sound. I live in the Ft. Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport area.  I often watch the aircraft crisscross across the sky.  I am not sure of the exact date of this sighting.  It was dusk, but there was still light in the sky.  I noticed an object flying slowly from the Northeast to the southwest.  It was not the shape of a plane, and triangular is close, but not exact.  Shortly afterward I was trying to notify Coast to Coast, but was unsuccessful.  I did however find a photo of a similiar object on their web site.  I tried to find it today, but was not able to do so.  What made me notice the object was it's unusual shape, and the fact it had no running lights, and it did not make a sound at all.  I have seen the Stealth Bomber fly.  It was not this aircraft.  But if you cut off the entire back of the bomber, and just take the top 1/4 of it.  This is similiar to what it looked like.  I watched it fly until it went behind some trees and blocked my view.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392

Looking at the stars we saw a very dim set of lights that moved quickly across the sky.  It was traveling S-Saw what looked like a dim red color.  The shape was V but not in perfect form, more like a flock of birds flying.  It moved from the north star to what I believe to be Venus (S of north star) and disappeared.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
Stationary triangle shaped light seen over Ft. Lauderdale beach area. Seen east (away from the sea). Estimated altitude 3,000 feet.;2007-07-20 21:15:00;15 minutes;Stationary triangle shaped light seen over Ft. Lauderdale beach area. Seen east (away from the sea). Estimated altitude 3,000 feet. At about 9:15 PM (23:15 hrs.), I and other two witnesses (wife and nephew) saw a bright white-yellow triangle shaped light (brighter than any star or planet at that time in the sky (as an amateur astronomer, I am familiar with the position of major stars and planets for that date in the sky). The light maintained its position for about 15 minutes and later disappeared. No aircraft navigation lights were observed, and no sound was heard from the object ( I have a degree in aeronautics, and I am familiar with most military and commercial aircraft configurations).;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392

It was moving at a steady pace and it wasn't loud as if it were a plane or helicopter.  It was a lot smaller than either of them.  I thought maybe I had seen a one of those blinking tower lights flashing, but once I focused on the red flashing object and realized it wasnt a blinking light from the electric poles, it vanished into thin air.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
Black triangle observed from commercial aircraft passengers a short time out of  Ft Lauderdale, Fla;2008-12-15 16:30:00;1-2 minutes;Black triangle observed from commercial aircraft passengers a short time out of  Ft Lauderdale, Fla I was on a continental flight, a short time out of Ft. Lauderdale, FL.  I observed a very black dot above the clouds, out the right side of the aircraft.  It looked like it was expanding, and became a very black triangle, it appeared to be several miles away.  It seemed to not move for 3-5 seconds then turned to a black line going the opposite direction of our aircraft.  I showed my wife the triangle and tried to get some pictures with our digital camera, but only show the black streak.   The visibility was good and we were at 37000'.  I spoke to the pilot about it when we landed in Newark, but he did not see it, or know anything about it.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
