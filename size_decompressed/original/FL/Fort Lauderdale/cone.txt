Long cone shaped yellowish-green light beam projected from clouds to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida;2008-07-27 02:00:00;2 seconds;Long cone shaped yellowish-green light beam projected from clouds to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida Driving North on I-95 between South Beach, Miami, Florida and Deerfield Beach, driving through Ft. Lauderdale, there was a lot of lightening activity up around the clouds.  We call this Heat Lightening.  None was touching down to Earth.  At a certain point, I noticed that a few clouds which had been disbursed and were not overlapping, finally became quite tightly knit together.  This,  I could tell because the light emitted revealed this. I had been watching them for miles.  All of a sudden, from this grouping of clouds which were intertwined came a beam of light in the shape of a tube/cone starting from the sky projected onto what seemed to be Ft. Lauderdale and this beam took the shape of a cone beam.  Larger at the bottom.  This lasted for about 2 seconds and retracted.  It did not just disappear, it retracted. Since it was at a distance, it was difficult to say whether it was over the ocean or land. At our angle on the freeway, above the rooftops but 1 mile South of Fort Lauderdale, this was difficult to determine.  I was driving with a friend who was visiting Florida and has absolutely no experience or interest in UFOs.  I asked her whether she was aware of what just happened.  Her response was sort of comical insinuating she couldnâ€™t believe her eyes.  We were both waiting for the helicopter to appear and continue to shine its beam but it never happened and the beam was way to intense and wide to be from a copter.  The quality of light was yellow with a tinge of green.  A copter reflector is more white, not as thick in width nor quality.  It sort of looked like a tube of water with light shining through it, from end to end.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
