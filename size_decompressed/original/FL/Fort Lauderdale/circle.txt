I stood up and try to follow the object, when suddenly it accelerated and I didn't see it anymore. It had a very subtle aura (pink);26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392

We were just about to depart for a night of boating on the Intercoastal,.When we noticed an object that appeared to be the same shape as a bright star..as we were watching it made a half moon movement around the star. Almost rotating around the star..then.its glow got smaller..it shot out into space with incredable speed. we could still see it barely..as it headed north. but by this time, it was well above any distance in which a any commercail airline would fly.As it proceeded out into the atmosphere, we could see a trail coming from the back of the object.This was the second sighting by myself.and the first for the others that were with me.

I saw all of those lights, approximately 4 in the lead in a line followed by a V formation of approximately 8 lights, followed by another v formation of lights, same amount, followed by a trail of lights in a staggered line of about 4 lights.     They all moved at the same pace, far too close to each other to be planes under the control of the Federal aviation center, but they looked like lights on a plane- the color in the center of the lights were red surrounded by orange and the outer portion yellow.  The lights were pulsating. One by one they just disappeared as they reached the same spot in the sky.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392

I live in a small apartment complex near Fort Lauderdale beach.  I was leaning against my car, thinking about my son, when I looked up into the sky and saw a strange, bright red ball coming from the east ocean side.  It was a large, bright red circle and in the middle it had a very bright yellowish light.   It was heading west, moving swiftly.  As the object moved, the red area that encircled the middle was almost a translucent red, like an aura but well defined.   As I stared at it, the object started to slow down and hover over me, for about 2-3 seconds.  Then it moved down slowly, and “floated” in the sky for about 10-15 seconds, then very slowly started to move upwards, then it stopped again for about 2 seconds, and then it began it’s slow westward trajectory.   The object moved over my apartment complex, stopped, then it faded.  The night was breezy w/clear skies.  The event lasted for ab! out 3-4 minutes.   My mom was with me and said to me, as we both stared at the circle, “Oh my, how beautiful.”  I have never experienced, or seen, anything like this before.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392

Circular, reddish UFO's spotted over FTL airport interact with each other & vanish!;2017-01-14 20:45:00;2 minutes;Circular, reddish UFO's spotted over FTL airport interact with each other & vanish! My friend was getting into his car at around 8:30-9:00pm, when he noticed something flying in the air.  He called me over and pointed toward the object he was watching and my eyes immediately fixated on it.  The object was very high in the sky and I live near the Fort Lauderdale airport so I know most aircrafts do not reach those altitudes when preparing to land or even after taking off.  Most airplanes I am familiar with never reach altitudes past 60,000 feet but the object had to have been up at least 100,000 feet.  The UFO appeared as a seemingly small, circular, reddish dot in the sky, it did not flash or glow.  It was traveling at relatively high speeds but that was the least interesting thing about it.   After we stood watching it for almost a minute, I pulled out my phone in an attempt to get real footage of what we witnessed.  I had an iPhone 6s Plus and the quality of the camera along with the height of the UFO made it impossible to capture due to the time ! of night.  (This has made me into more of a believer than before knowing that even modern day technology is barely capable of capturing something so astonishingly high in the sky.)  It made no audible sounds possibly because of its altitude.   We watched the object continue across the sky until we noticed another exactly similar one!  They were flying towards each other until they got very close to one another.  I knew this was beyond human capability, because one UFO (the second one to be spotted) came to an abrupt stop.  The UFO we originally seen continued on after they had crossed paths for approximately 5-10 seconds.  We watched in amazement and curiosity as the second UFO stopped moving as if it had spotted us!  It shot a white, star-colored dust into the air which dissipated very quickly, which after deep thought, we believe to be a thruster of some sort because the second UFO vanished moments later.   In total, we witnessed about 2 minutes of seemingly unexplainable activity happening thousands of feet above us.  My only dream now is to make contact with those potential life forms as I find humans intolerant or ignorant to the concept of extraterrestrial life inhospitable.  Please do not take this as a joke, there is clear, consistent evidence of extraterritorial contact being covered up by governments around the world.  If there is any way I could assist the NUFORC or MUFON team in proving other-worldly existence, please reach out to me!;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392

He was outside his workplace and had to be at his station by 22:00.  He observed the light change  gradually from a point to a ring.

Silent, low-flying circular aircraft with green beams of light directed at two different people minutes apart, from different angles.;2021-04-08 00:00:00;40 minutes;Silent, low-flying circular aircraft with green beams of light directed at two different people minutes apart, from different angles. At approximately midnight, on Thursday, April 8th, 2021, my fiance alerted me to something occurring outside. What I saw was similar to something I have seen decades ago but what occured was unlike anything I have ever experienced in my life.  Approximately 1,000 feet above us, was a silent aircraft with lights colored white, green and red, flashing in a circular motion.  I remained outside, watching the aircraft approach, while my fiance went inside to get his cell phone.  As the craft approached me overhead from the West, I was approximately 4 feet away from my doorway, on the sidewalk area of an L shaped apartment building, looking up.  Suddenly two green beams of light emerged from the aircraft and the same color but much less dense filled the space in between. The distance of the two light beams widened as they approached me, forming somewhat of a triangle, the base of which was sweeping the ground directly in front of me and towards me, nearly enveloping me.  I stepped backwards as it and the lights approached. I felt I was its target, being directly in the center of its two beams and field of light which continued to approach me, quickly.  My door was still opened. As I backed up, I grabbed my door in fear, yelled to my fiance, stepped inside & closed the door. I half jokingly told my fiance I almost got swept up by aliens and he told me that was what happened to him before he came to get me, only the aircraft was traveling East to West when it happened to him, while he was standing at the far edge of our property, approximately 70 feet away from our door.  So, the aircraft traveled East to West, 'scoped' my fiance, then traveled West to East towards me and did the same.  Together we exited our apartment shortly thereafter and watched the aircraft travel farther East, still fairly low to the ground and silent, but without beams emitting from it. Only the red, green and white lights continued to flash, as we watched it travel farther away. He took pictures at this time, as well as immediately after it 'swept' me.  I ran back inside to get my phone and car keys. I took video at this time but it was rather far away. We decided to try to get closer to it by using our vehicle.  The aircraft began to fly South as we began to drive East. We pulled into a sidestreet and I attempted to take video of the aircraft again. It remained silent, without emitting beams and continued to fly South, farther away.  When we arrived back to our parking lot, I searched online who to call for a ufo report. I called the number and the gentlemen suggested I & my fiance write separate reports and submit them.  It is now 2:29am, April 9th and I am still shaken up a bit, wondering if anyone else has experienced this or saw what took place just a few hours ago.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
