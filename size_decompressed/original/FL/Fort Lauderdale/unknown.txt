We were leaving work, heading to my truck when I looked in the clear sky to the north, We seen flat black object. I called it the wing. It appeared it wasnt moveing. Then it was infront of us. I said its on silant mode,there was no sound. Their was a large thunderhead to the south of us, it headed twards the large thunderhead and tuned on a tweenty to thirty degree angle and slowly went into the cloud. It was as big as the cloud. We watched the front of the v shaped wing go into cloud on a angle until we could see the two ends went in. Thats why it appeared to be flat.It would have been 5 to 10 times the size of a large jet aircraft.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392

object vented some type of vapor and left a cone shaped vortex when it left the atmosphere;2004-09-02 21:00:00;20 min;object vented some type of vapor and left a cone shaped vortex when it left the atmosphere Two days before Hurricane Francis came ashore in south Fl. I was preparing my home and property for the storm. As I walked around my pool, I noticed off to the west what I thought was just a bright star and only looked at it for a second as I was quite busy. A few minutes later I thought to look at it again just because it was so bright. This time it appeared much closer so I watched it for a moment. It was a clear evening with just a few puffy white clouds moving to the west and I knew this was an object other than a star because it was moving to the east, towards my location. I called into the house for my wife and friend to step outside and watch the light. It got to within I would say a mile off where I was and it height was below the level of the clouds as I noticed one pass behind what ever it was I was looking at. It slowed to a stop and began to hover and then it went dark. We could tell there was something there but even with binoculars we could not make out the shape of the object. There was no sound that we could connect with the object but it was right in the middle of a large residential/commercial area and within a mile of the executive airport. What really got us a little freaked out about it was when the object began to expell some sort of mist or fumes that took the form of wings or some type of venting and both of the flumes, for lack of a better word, were huge. I estimate they were more than 100 yards one off to each side of the object. After 15 minutes or so, the craft moved off to the north and appeared to be going higher. As it disappeared out of site a cone shaped, I want to say vortex, appeared way up in the sky about where we last saw the craft. THe point of the cone was pointing towards space but angled off to the north a bit. I have no clue what this could have been but it was truly a life changing experience for me as it has truly opened my mind far beyond what I would have previosly considered within the realm of possibilities. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD));26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
Blue lights seen hovering 300 -400 feet above westbound lanes of I-75.;2008-03-31 23:50:00;3-5 minutes;Blue lights seen hovering 300 -400 feet above westbound lanes of I-75. Monday, March 31st 2008  On the evening of March 31, 2008, I traveled west via I-75. I had left a softball game in Davie, FL to return to my home to Naples, FL. I was traveling westbound to Naples, FL on Interstate 75, otherwise known as Alligator Alley, as I neared exit 49, I thought I was seeing an airplane traveling at a very low altitude. I noticed lights in the sky just beyond the overpass, when I came to the other side of the overpass I realized that this was not any airplane. I saw an object with four bluish lights on four corners, like the shape of a square or a cross. Since it was dark, I did not see the exact shape. The object was about 300 - 400 feet above the ground and it did not travel at the speed of an airplane, instead it hovered over a certain area. It caught my attention because it hardly moved. I drove directly underneath the object. It covered the two westbound lanes of the highway and half of the median. I continued on and did not stop because I got scared. I looked at my car radio and it was exactly 11:50 PM. What I saw was not anything I have ever seen. I am very confident that I seen a UFO. I wonder if anyone else seen what I did because I was not the only one traveling on that road that night.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
Strange black object flies inland from ocean preceding sunrise;2010-05-29 06:00:00;2-3 minutes;Strange black object flies inland from ocean preceding sunrise My girlfriend and I walked out to the beach this morning to watch the sunrise. It was approximately 15-20 minutes before actual sunrise, when the sky was just lighting up, very clear out, we were standing in front of the Westin on A1A just north of Las Olas Blvd. We got to the water's edge and after a couple seconds I looked up and my eyes immediately fixated on something moving across the sky. It's very difficult to describe what we saw. The object was black - at first I thought it might be a bird very high up, but I couldn't discern any wings flapping, it just looked like a solid object moving slowly over the ocean, over and past us and continuing inland. There were no flashing lights, and as there were quite a few planes on the horizon, it was quite easy to see that this was not one of them. It was hard to focus on also, it seemed far away but quite low at the same time for a second I actually thought it sort of looked like a person flying, but I dismissed this for obvious reasons. My girlfriend described it as an asymmetrical rectangular blob floating westward, not like a bird that varies direction and flaps its wings, but more like a balloon. Very creepy, no sound at all, and again this thing flew in from the ocean, maybe 1,000 ft (?) up, and proceeded inland. There were several planes on the horizon, several miles away and clearly discernible as conventional aircraft. The object that passed above us most definitely was not.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
Flickering amber light and constant noise.;2013-07-18 03:00:00;2 minutes;Flickering amber light and constant noise My husband and I saw flickering amber lights and heard a monotonous constant noise, sounding like an electric motorbike travelling South to North right over our property in Fort Lauderdale around 330 am on Wednesday, July 18.  Does someone know what that could have been?;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
Very slow object.;2013-10-29 07:28:00;2 minutes;Very slow object Driving east bound on 17th street causeway near Broward General Medical Center in the SE sky a very slow moving object was traveling straight up with a large plum behind.  Once I dropped off my friend to work (25 sec) I stopped in the Wells Farge parking lot across from the hospital to get a better look.  The whole plume of smoke was gone and there was just a very small puff of white smoke where the object was located.  I took aprox 6 photographs of the puff of smoke.  I looked at them via Photoshop and the puff of smoke was discolored yellow and orange.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
