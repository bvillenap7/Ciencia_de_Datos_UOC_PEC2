Two stars moving upward and becoming united as one.;1969-06-29 21:30:00;2-3 minutes;Two stars moving upward and becoming united as one. Years ago shortly after moving to Ft. Lauderdale from Miami, I saw what appeared to be two stars in the4 distant sky above the trees. (About 9:30 p.m.) I watched as they moved upwards gtom their position and met, becoming one star. Later I wrote Isaac Asimov of this and he replied that Stars are too far away to show motion I do not know what you saw, but it wasm't atsrs. Then I wrote David O. Woodbury, author of The Glass Giant of Palomar (Dodd, Mead), 1963), and he replied, saying that I  saw Venus. He said thsat this planet has strange appearances, looking differant at differant times through the atmosphere, aAND SOMETIMES APPEARS TO BE TWO PLANETS and in strange colors. (Asimov had said in a followup that Sun, atmosphere and dust are all necessary  in earth conditions.) Morris K. essup has written that there is a neutraL ZONE  somewhere between the sun and earth, and hen it is feasible that space people ot objects could utilize this neutral gravitational/magnetic field (or plane) for such materialization. This agrees with Ruth Montgomery's gides who maintain that space people come from all over the universe invisibly taking no time to do so (by thought travel), and then they materialise within our atmosphere. Timothy Good in his book, Above Top Secret quoted a scientist who studied under Einstein, saying that nations and governments have no weapon against  the paranormal, and thus must keep this UFO information secret (evidently so people will not think we earthlings are under the control of Extra- terrestrials. However several former military men anonymously have written that our government ,ade a secret agreement with ETs receiving scientific information and knowledge in exchange for abductees for their study, however it was found that they are abducting more than agreed upon. ((NUFORC Noe:  Witness states a precise date for the incident, but we wonder if that is the case.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
Iluminated straight line in clear blue sky;2007-04-08 03:20:00;5.5 to 6 seconds;Iluminated straight line in clear blue sky 04/08/07 Time 3:20 pm Location East Ft Lauderdale Florida Weather Conditions: The sky was perfect and blue. Not a cloud in sight and there was no sun to obstruct my view.  As I was lying out doors in my back yard on my back and looking directly straight up into the clear blue sky I noticed an illuminated thin straight line that appeared directly in my site of view. It shined for a second and looked like it was glass or metallic. At my first sight of the illuminated line it was vertical. It then switched to a horizontal position in a split second and was about 1/4 to 1/2 of an inch in length against the blue sky. I watched the horizontal illuminated perfect straight line tilt up on its right side and move up and down and to the left and to the right. Then I watched it tilt up on its left side and move around the same way. It moved with such speed and accuracy I have never seen anything like this before in my life. It then leveled off to a horizontal position, hovered for a second and then took off crossing the entire south side of the sky in a split second. It had easily covered a 180 degree angle if not more. The object was always a perfect straight illuminated line and never did it bend. It broke every law of physics regarding speed and flight capability. I am very lucky, honored and privileged to have experienced something of this magnitude in my life time. It was truly something that was NOT even close to being of this world or man made. The object sighting lasted for about 5.5 to 6 seconds. If one wasnâ€™t looking into this exact section/area of the sky at this exact moment one would not be able to see what I saw. It was not visible to all. You really had to be focused on that exact area. The speed of the object was like taking a laser pen and pointing it against a wall and moving it rapidly around up and down to the left and to the right. It was moving that fast in the sky. This is only something one could see if they were watching a sci- fi movie. The technology we have in our armed forces and in this world today are (stone- aged) compared to what I have witnessed and I would take a polygraph test 100 times just to prove what I saw was in fact real.   I am so happy and excited that I was able to witness such an extraordinary event in my life time and it was even on Easter Sunday 2007. Thank you,  MH;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
Some kind of sonic boom followed by rumble.;2010-12-26 00:05:00;~5 seconds;Some kind of sonic boom followed by rumble. Below is the exact description I sent in an email to george noory of coast to coast am the evening after the incident which took place just after midnight on christmas night.  I decided to finally report this after hearing of so many other incidents that sounded almost exactly like mine which occurred more and more in the months and years after my experience and came to believe it may be related to the UFO phenomenon. On Christmas night I was sweeping my sons floor and I hear a huge explosion which scared me at first but I immediately assumed it was a large firework from someone messing around and continued sweeping but then immediately realized it was still making an after sound like when you hear the rumble of thunder after a big lightning strike.  It was loud enough to set off a bunch of car alarms and rattle my windows.  When I thought it was thunder I promptly ran outside thinking it might start pouring rain and I had to cover my motorcycle.   So I ran out there looked up and there wasn't a cloud in the sky.  It was one of the clearest nights you could ever find in south Florida.  It couldn't have been a lightning strike with a clear sky.  I know it wasn't fireworks because I know exactly what those sound like up close.   My only other thought was a sonic boom which I have heard before but there were no jets or jet sounds, I didn't even see any regular planes in the sky just stars and I looked very carefully.  My neighbors heard it to but no one had any idea what it was.   Just thought my story should be out there and wondering how many other people may have heard this boom.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
Fast traveling craft 03:30.;2016-10-09 03:30:00;3 minutes;fast traveling craft 03:30 shape crossed sky heading south.zero flashing lights only a steady glow.  speed, hard to say as altitude is not known.  the craft came into sight and went out of sight in less than 2 minutes.  My guess is some type of surveillance craft at high altitude.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
