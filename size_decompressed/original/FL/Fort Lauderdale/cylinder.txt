It is a clear blue sky day and the highway is next to the Atlantic Ocean.  The ocean was calm and less than 12in waves crashing the shore.  Out to sea, I could see three large freighters anchored off of Port Everglades, approx three miles off shore. Some small recreational boats numbering less than 5 were crossing the horizon heading north and south and out to sea to weed line for fishing. Out to the NE I would guess approxmently 7 to 10 miles I could see two very large standing tall white cylinders and two to three white cubes next to the cylinders.  It looked like tall buildings out in the ocean I would say that they were 8 to 12 stories high and 4 stories wide. The 2 to 3 cubes were ½ the size.  There are no oil rigs off of Broward County this was not a ship, a cruise ship, boat, and water spout or condominium refection from the shore line.  I don’t know what it was, but it was out there, on the ocean like a city on the sea.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392

There were no flashing lights of any kind, just white. It looked like a cylinder and it did not move from it's position.  At first I thought it may be a helicopter covering an accident on the interstate but they make noise and move, and this object never moved.  I took 3 pictures with my camera phone.  I went back out after daybreak and the object was gone.  I will email the photos to the site you have provided below.;26.1291795933187;-80.218148293392
