Fast moving object Bright orange star shaped.... Silent;2013-09-13 20:30:00;15 seconds;Fast moving object Bright orange star shaped.... Silent 9/13/2013  At Approximately 20:30 hours on above stated date I witnessed an object in the sky above Keystone Heights, Florida.  I was alone in my back yard at the time.  Movement in the sky to my left caught my attention, and I turned to see an orange light moving through a break in the tree cover.  It was a bright orange color without any pulsing or variation in brightness.  It was moving at a rate that would suggest in was at a fairly low altitude, or if higher moving extremely fast.  I was expecting to hear some kind of sound from engines or rotors.  Complete silence at first made me think it was one of those Chinese lanterns sometimes released into the air.  As it came overhead it was still silent and moving at fast pace.  It had a perfect five pointed star shape with the orange light extending from each point and fading.  I took my eyes off it for only a couple seconds to try and get a better vantage point, and it was gone.  Never seen this bright orange colored light on any aircr! aft, and there was no blinking or pulsing.  Completely silent, and either very high and moving very fast or fairly low.  I have never witnessed anything that I would consider an unexplained aircraft or UFO, but this was something that I cannot explain as anything else.
