Strobes.  ((anonymous report));2013-09-20 22:00:00;10 seconds;I was heading to the bar with my friend, who was the driver.  On a back road we came up on a local compactor waste facility approx. 4 acre clearing fenced in.  It was night time and we saw a region of space about 25 feet off the ground and about 10 feet in diameter flashing rapidly like a few dozen camera strobes.   We slowed down as we passed it and turned around.  It was gone.  The flashes seemed to be the bottom of an object we couldn't see.  The flashing was literally like camera strobes in no particular pattern we could recognize.   We parked in front of the gate after it had disappeared and decided to go home.  The flashes lit up the ground and surroundings.  There was no noise other than the imagined noises from the flashes triggering a false noise in our heads as if you see a gun shot on tv without sound.  It was very real.  My buddy will tell you the same thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
