Yellowish orange sphere high off the coast of  eastern Florida!;2011-07-15 02:00:00;2:00 min;Yellowish orange sphere high off the coast of  eastern Florida! I noticed this yellowish orange light high in the eastern sky in the northern part of palm beach county over the Atlantic in the early hours of the evening.  I was rideing my bike back home and finnaly stopped to get a better look.  It was over cast with enough cloud cover to basically cover any light from any stars.  Watching this it beacme aware to me that if it was a star it was below the cloud cover!  Then without any flash or forward movement, it became noticeable it was moving further and further away until it basically vanished.  I dont know if anyone else spotted this!
