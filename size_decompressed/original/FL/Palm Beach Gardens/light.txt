Distinctly different from stars, meteors, and comets due to appearance and movement. To ensure that it wasn't an illusion due to the movement of the clouds, a reference point was used and tested for dozens of the objects. Very sure they were not planes as they arrived in the hundreds and afterwards completely disappeared. Planes were in the vicinity.;26.8238;-80.1406999999999

Bobbing red, blue and white light seen west of Palm Beach Gardens, FL.;2011-04-23 22:45:00;15 minutes;Bobbing red, blue and white light seen west of Palm Beach Gardens, FL. My girlfriend and I were sitting watching tv when I noticed a revolving red/blue/white light coming from the west. Now I figured it would be a anything from a star, plane, etc.  I have a background in aviation and I knew that it was nothing of a normal aircraft.  This object was pretty high up but not high enough to be mistaken for a star, satellite, etc.   We walked outside to our second story patio to get a better look.  This object just had us dumbfounded. It seemed to revolve around with the red/blue/white type of lighting as well as almost bob around on an irregular axis.   I have seen things before that could have been considered unidentified, but lastnight's sighting totally changed my belief that these things do exist.   Finally after about 15 minutes of this object hovering in the same general area it simply vanished, almost like someone shut the switch off on a light, just disappeared.   I am very curious to know if anyone was able to witness what we did and ! their conclusions as to what it could have been. This was not a normal object/plane/helicopter etc. To add to this, there were normal aircraft flying by it in the 15 minute span with their own becons, nav lights, etc. I hope I get to witness something like this again, thank you for your time.;26.8238;-80.1406999999999
Five orange flying objects in the nights sky and no sound.;2013-10-11 09:05:00;10-15 seconds;Five orange flying objects in the nights sky and no sound. My apartment sits on a small hill and there are no large trees to obstruct the evening sky.  I go outside frequently just to stare at the stars. I’ve done this since I was a kid. When I walked outside this evening there was movement in the dark sky.  At first I thought it was an airplane since I live near the airport but on closer examination I notice there were 5 objects that were moving synchronistically as if they were controlled by one pilot.  I heard no sound.  The flying objects were glowing a soft orange color and were moving in the south easterly direction..  The objects were flying in a “V” formation and slowly straightened out.  They did not behave like conventional aircrafts.  Their movement was more fluid, smoother.  The whole sighting lasted a few seconds and then they just vanished.;26.8238;-80.1406999999999
