There were about 4 or 5 round shape lights on each wing I believe.   Lights were not very strong but obvious enough for observation.   No sound was heard at all. It was way above my head, so I could not tell how big that object was.   It travelled quietly pretty fast and I believe faster than an airplane.   Anyone else saw this object in Palm Beach area at all??;26.8238;-80.1406999999999
