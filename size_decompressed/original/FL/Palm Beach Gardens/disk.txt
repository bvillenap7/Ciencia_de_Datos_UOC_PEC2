Round bright whitish- not moving for a long time.  Enough time for me to get binoculars and see it much better, around static center has a moving very bright pulsating light going around clockwise.  I try to record but only with iPhone, too small( though much, much bigger then any star). I got few photos also with IPhone. Waked up from my sleep by our dog who as never wanted to go outside.;26.8238;-80.1406999999999
