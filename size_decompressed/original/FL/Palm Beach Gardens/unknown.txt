extremely bright glowing object at dusk, then fading to three lights circling craft in odd flash pattern;2003-09-23 19:45:00;5-7 min's;extremely bright glowing object at dusk, then fading to three lights circling craft in odd flash pattern My three children and myself stopped at a traffic light and a train was coming so we were sitting for sometime. As I looked at my daughter in the passenger seat, I noticed a bright light to the East and became curious as I watched it move to a stationary position in the sky and the light it emitted became brighter and brighter.  It was much too bright to be a star and remained COMPLETELY  stationary for 3 - 4 minutes.  It was extremely bright at its center.  A really strange thing was how the light from the object illuminated the clouds around it.  I noticed how a cloud below it was softly lit up (not glowing) as a light bulb might shine onto an object.  Then the light from the object slowly faded and the object then turned slowly toward the south and continued on.  The lights were similar in color to a planes running lights except the green was replaced by a blue flasher and the pattern was not consistent.  The lighting effect was as if the flashers circled the craft, as opposed to consistent flashers on airplanes.  The sun had completely vanished at this point and we were unable to determine what it was or the exact shape.  I have never seen anything so bright and so still in one spot in the sky for such a long period of time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));26.8238;-80.1406999999999
