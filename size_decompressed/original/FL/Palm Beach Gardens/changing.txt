Solid white, round stationary object for 1 hour;2000-08-20 09:35:00;Appx 1 hour;Solid white, round stationary object for 1 hour Clear bright morning...out with the dog and noticed the moon still visible in westers sky at 9:30 a.m. Not a cloud in sight, just a clear blue sky and a big bright moon still visible and just to the lower right, a round solid white object that was stationary. Watched for a minute or two to see if it would move...it wouldn't. Noticed that it slowly appeared to be changing shape...round to boomerang, then to cigar shape then back to round. Always remained white. Not metallic or sparkly or flashing or pulsing....just solid white and changing it's shape slowly. This was not an aircraft or balloon. Local planetarium closed so called police. Officer showed up and was amazed as well but had no idea what it was either. My mother saw it and a neighbor. Unfortunately...no one had binoculars. The object was in the foreground compared to the moon..in other words..not behind the moon...but closer. Watched for an hour and it seemed to dissapear.  I am a skeptic and would not even have bothered searching for a web site such as this if I had never seen this object!;26.8238;-80.1406999999999
