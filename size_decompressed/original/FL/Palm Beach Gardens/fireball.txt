Two fireballs seen over Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.;2013-12-31 21:00:00;10 minutes;Two fireballs seen over Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. We were sitting on the patio at around 9:00 p.m. and witnessed the first of two fireballs pass over us traveling from NE towards SW.  About 10 minutes later, the second fireball passed over taking the same path as the first one.  To guess, they were probably 2,000 feet high, orange and yellow, and could have been meteors.  What we saw was identical to the report of 12/22/13 from North Palm Beach, FL except for the direction of travel of the object.  NPB is a 2 minute drive from where our sighting was.  They followed the flight path taken by planes making a landing approach to West Palm Beach International Airport, except they were at at least twice the altitude of a landing plane.  We noticed two planes take a slightly different approach after the fireballs went by.  Instead of heading SW, they took a more of a due south approach and then banked hard to the west, maybe avoiding these objects. Interesting.;26.8238;-80.1406999999999
