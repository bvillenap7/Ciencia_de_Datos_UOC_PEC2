Military hiding UFO at training camp.;1992-10-23 09:00:00;5 minutes;Military hiding UFO at training camp. As I was driving towards Camp Blanding (a military traing camp)   I saw a ball of light. The light pulsated from bright to dim.  I followed the light till I couldn't go any further because the road ended at Camp Blanding.  I has to turn either left or right.  I turned right and went ahead towards Jacksonville.  As I watched the object it decended down below the trees probably a mile or so away.  I could still see the lights through the trees when it went bright.   The next morning, as I was driving home, I seen armed guards at every back gate to the camp.  I have never seen any soldiers in the thousand times I have drove by it before.  There where Humvee's driving parameter patrols as well.  I am certain that our military has already made contact but won't share it with the rest of the world. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch at 2055 hrs (EDT).  PD))   A long orange light moving in the sky.  I was uncertain if it was a plane;2005-04-29 20:55:00;5 mins;A long orange light moving in the sky.  I was uncertain if it was a plane, I watched it separate. Two lights, lots of smoke, separated from the main orange light.  Then they finally dimmed out.  Then the main light kept moving in a northwest direction.  I kept watching and something else separated from that light, too far more me to tell what was going on. ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the witness describes above the launch of a Titan IV missile out of Cape Canaveral, which occurred at 20:55 hrs. (Eastern) on this date.  The missile apparently was launched to the northeast, so it was visible along the eastern shoreline of the U. S..  PD))));30.1494920454546;-81.7474272727273

We found that to be very strange, we continued home as normal.   I was in the house when my wife and children yelled for me to come here, I ran to see what the commotion was all about I could not believe my eyes,  There in the sky a glowing, pulsating orb of some sort slowly glide across the sky and disappeared below the tree line it was so close it looked as if you could touch but so far that all you could see was the shape of the thing.  I am still in awe shocked and in disbelief all at the same time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

One reddish/green orb flying southeast to northwest in the sky.;2017-07-04 21:40:00;1-2 minutes;One reddish/green orb flying southeast to northwest in the sky. One reddish green flashing or pulsation orb was moving south east to north west.  No sound was noted to this object. The sky was clear and firework had just finished up in the eastern direction. Could not determine speed or height the orb was moving at though it was moving faster than a conventional aircraft and was moving up and down or wobbling at the same time it was moving forward.;30.1494920454546;-81.7474272727273
