Bright orange light in sky above Jacksonville by NAS Jax;2015-05-07 20:54:00;~10 minutes;Bright orange light in sky above Jacksonville by NAS Jax. First and foremost, I need to state that I selected fireball as the shape of the craft because that's the closest description.  I posted a video on YouTube and will provide a link at the end of this report. On May 7, 2015, I was standing with a buddy on our friend's front porch having a conversation when, above the house across the street, we see a bright orange ball cutting across the sky, moving from north to south.  At first we thought this was a fireball or maybe a meteor falling thru the atmosphere (in the video you'll hear me state this).  After a few moments I change my assumption because there was no discernible smoke trail, indicating that it couldn't be a fireball.  We followed this object for a few minutes until it became difficult to see. I need to be clear about a couple of things that lead me to believe this is a UFO.  When we first saw the object we assumed it was a fireball since it was coming towards us and we could see the heat shield as if it were falling thru the atmosphere at us.  The reason I changed my assumption is because we got turned around 180 degrees from the porch we were standing on and could still see the same heat shield from the rear of the object and there was no smoke trail.  It couldn't have been a modern day jet or plane either because we wouldn't have seen the jet's flame until it was going away from us but we clearly saw the color as it was coming towards us and going away from us. Here is the link for the video. If you have any information please leave a comment on the youtube page.;30.1494920454546;-81.7474272727273
