lights over the eclpise;2003-05-15 23:16:00;15 miutes or so;lights over the eclpise At about 11:16 or so i was outside observing the lunner eclpise when myself and my brother saw this tear shaped blueish purple light pass in front of the now dark shaded moon.....it sat in one spot right in the bottom left-right side of the dark moon......for approx.12 mins it sat there just changing colors not getting closer or farther away,i know this because of the constent size and shape. after the moon started to lighten back up it took off at a very very high rate of speed straight up and it was gone..........;30.1494920454546;-81.7474272727273
