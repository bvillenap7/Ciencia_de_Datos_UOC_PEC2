Ball of light, flash, fast.  ((anonymous report));2016-08-16 22:00:00;Short;Ball of light, flash, fast. While on my way to retrieve my laundry, I looked up at the sky to admire the stars.   For a split second, a small ball of light raced a crossed the sky.  It left a trail of light behind it that disappeared, just as fast.   It seemed closer to the ground than a plane would be.   It was white and circular in shape, brighter than the stars and moon in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate a date of the sighting, so we have assigned one arbitrarily.
