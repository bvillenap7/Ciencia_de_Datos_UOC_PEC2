Disk in the sky above city;2001-07-15 20:00:00;3 minutes;Disk in the sky above city I was looking east when I noticed a disk like craft slowly drifting from South to norht and appeared to wable on it's Norht/South axis to approximadly 45 degrees left, then right. The disk seem pail gray in some fation but as it was night, I could not really tell you. I did not see any noticible lights or markings on this craft and it was unlike anything I have evern seen in my years of in the Military (9). The craft was moving slowly at or around 75 miles per hour. It was flying at a low altitude and seemed to be in front of some clouds and behind others. I watched it closely for nearly 3 minutes until it drifted out of sight, hidden by clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD));30.1494920454546;-81.7474272727273
Object appeared to be burning, hovering low enough to see it wasn't a plane.;2015-07-04 23:30:00;4 minutes;Object appeared to be burning, hovering low enough to see it wasn't a plane. I was driveway and thought I saw a falling star, however, the object in question seemed to slow into a sort of hover.  I called attention to it and my near by friends.   The object at first seemed like it was burning but was so bright it appeared to be glinting.  I pulled my phone out and snapped a picture.  It seemed to hover for around 40 seconds before rapidly ascending in a sort of vertical angle.  I could see it for approximately 3 and a half minutes before it was no longer visible.;30.1494920454546;-81.7474272727273
