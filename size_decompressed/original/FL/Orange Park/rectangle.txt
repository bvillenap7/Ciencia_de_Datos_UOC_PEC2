Cloud shield maker over Clay County, Florida.;2007-04-30 13:00:00;5 mins;Cloud shield maker over Clay county Florida My wife and I had just finished lunch at some eatery on Fleming Island (Orange Park, FL) and were headed west on SR 220 (Clay county). I had just remarked at to what a beautiful day and as to how the sky was completely cloudless when I noticed a very small cloud (the only cloud) in the sky almost immediately straight ahead of us and about 45 degrees from the horizon.  The cloud, strangely enough, was almost square and about the size of my thumbnail when viewed at arms length.  I thought that to be quite odd, pointed it out to my wife and we both continued to look at it. As we watched, the cloud slowly dissipated, fading out completely and then amazingly reappeared in the same place in much the same shape and form.  My wife, not nearly as interested as I was, watched for a second and then something in her purse, perhaps her cell phone--I don’t remember,   attracted her attention.  It was at that point that the cloud dissipated again and I saw what appeared to be a small gray craft, its features somewhat blurry and indistinct but squarish in feature. Look I said it’s a UFO, but in the fraction of a second it took for my wife to look again it was gone.   Of course she didn’t believe me. I would have submitted this report sooner but I just now found this site.   However the above report was written as soon as I got home that day - about an hour after the viewing.  I have not altered it since then.;30.1494920454546;-81.7474272727273
