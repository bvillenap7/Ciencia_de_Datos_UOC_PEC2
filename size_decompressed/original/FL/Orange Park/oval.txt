It was approx. 5:40 am eastern time.I was waiting on traffic to make a right turn on Blanding Blvd. Something caught my eye going across the sky toward the western part. It was as big and bright as viewing Venus, however it was traveling at a very fast rate. I watch it till it passed over the horizon. However my horizon ends with some structures in the way. I passed it off at first thinking that it was a meteor. However after thinking about it, it had no trail behind it. It couldnt have been a jet (as we have military bases nearby)because the bright light would have been coming toward me,also there were no port and starboard lights. My only other thought was that maybe it was the Space Station going over head in orbit. However a friend of mine said when you view the space station in the sky it appears stabilised. So I am not sure what it was, and I have not heard any other reports.;30.1494920454546;-81.7474272727273
