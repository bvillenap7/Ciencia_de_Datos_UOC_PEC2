Green orb hovered parallel to my car in Orange Park, FL.;2014-05-20 22:00:00;Few seconds;Green orb hovered parallel to my car in Orange Park, FL. In short, I was driving home from school at night (no drugs or anything of that sort, nor was I extremely tired), and as I was approaching the intersection of Kingsley Ave and 17 (Orange Park, FL), at about 10:00 P.M..  I saw what looked like a green orb running parallel to my car (I think I was going about 35-40 MPH), maybe at about 60 degrees to my left, on the opposite (East) side of the road (I was traveling South).  I think, even though it would move in a straight line, it would appear in front of certain objects, and behind other objects.   This went on for maybe a few seconds a most, and then it suddenly flew off really fast, and I think it left a very soft, green, light trail behind it, which faded away quickly.  That is the last detail I recall. I am 22 years old at the time of this report not on any medications besides allergy relief.;30.1494920454546;-81.7474272727273
White DOT observed at 1300 hours - Orange Park, Florida;2020-05-22 13:00:00;3 minutes;White DOT observed at 1300 hours - Orange Park, Florida At approximately 1300 hours on May 22, 2020, I was waiting outside of Sonnyâ€™s BBQ on Kingsley Avenue in Orange Park, Florida. Looking North across Kingsley Avenue is a construction crane, with the boom facing East, at the Orange Park Medical Center.  Maybe one or two degrees above, and halfway of the boom, there was a bright white dot against a blue sky. The dot was not navigating as if it were a balloon or aircraft, but maybe as if it was a Bald Eagle. The dot moved slowly with respect to our location on the ground, and moved from two degrees above the boom to maybe near 20 degrees. It made gradual loops as it transitioned higher and higher in reference to the original location. The dance in the sky lasted for about three minutes before the object accelerated away Northeast at a flash of a speed.  A Retired Navy Chief friend, and a couple standing next to me also observed the object, but had no idea what it may be.;30.1494920454546;-81.7474272727273
