Two points of light darted across the sky side by side, crossed paths and continued out over the Florida Panhandle;2000-10-01 21:00:00;10 seconds;Two points of light darted across the sky side by side, crossed paths and continued out over the Florida Panhandle I did not make an official report of the sighting for a number of reasons (people thinking that I'm crazy when I tell them being at the top of the list). I did have a witness who saw the incident with me, but to date we are the only ones I know of. As we stood talking in the front yard of his Orange Park home one Fall evening, the sky was virtually clear with only a few clouds around (few and far between). I noticed something in the sky that at first came to my mind as two birds flying directly over his house reflecting the light from his front porch. I then realized first off that it was not birds, then, that it was not close enough to the house to be reflecting the light. The objects, themselves were no brighter than the stars around them and they left no discernable trail behind them. They flew side by side, then in a uniform move they crossed paths and continued on in the same direction (East to West) and in what seemed to be the same distance apart that they had been before they crossed paths. They continued on in this formation until they were out of sight over my friends rooftop. The whole incident took only a few seconds, but my mind raced to try to explain to my senses exactly what I was observing. To this day I am not at all sure what it was, but as I said my friend and I were the only ones to date to have seen the sight. I thought also in the few seconds of the occurence that it might be shooting stars but, they did not fade from view and the maneuvers were too precise and calculated. If someone could explain what it was that I saw I would appreciate it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));30.1494920454546;-81.7474272727273
