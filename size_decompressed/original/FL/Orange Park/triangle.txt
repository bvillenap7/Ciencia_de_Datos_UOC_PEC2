11-12 orange colored triangular objects sighted for about 2 minutes around midnight in Orange Park, Fl. On Sept. 26, 2016;2016-09-26 23:59:00;2 minutes;11 to 12 orange colored triangular objects sighted for about 2 minutes around midnight in Orange Park, Fl. On Sept. 26, 2016 I was taking my dog out after the debate, before bed.  I looked up to see if the sky had cleared so I could see the stars, which I love to do.  I was shocked to see a group of orange, triangular shaped, moving objects.  They were larger than any of the planets or stars I could see.  They were just above the tree line, probably 60 degrees.  I would have thought it was a flock of geese had it been daytime or had each been lit!  But, they were each lit, a fairly bright orange, and the 11 or 12 objects flew rather slowly.  There was no noise that I could hear and the v shape was not perfect.  Some flew somewhat out of formation, for lack of a better word.  I wonder if anyone else saw this.;30.1494920454546;-81.7474272727273
