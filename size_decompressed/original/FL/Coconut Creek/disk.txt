Two ships, 500 feet away, over Tradewinds Park and as large as 2 to 3 football fields each;1985-09-20 16:00:00;4 minutes;Two ships, 500 feet away, over Tradewinds Park and as large as 2 to 3 football fields each I was driving north on the Florida Turnpike and saw the 2 ufo's hovering overhead. I turned to my passenger and told him to look up and tell me what he sees.  He asked me to pull over quickly. We stopped and watched for about four minutes two disk shaped objects about 500 feet over Tradewinds Park.  There were fogged windows on each saucer and we could see shapes moving past them.  The top was silver and the bottom was a glowing orange.  After awhile, the left saucer slowly moved south and blinked out of existence.  About thirty seconds later the second did the same. When they departed, there was no sound whatsoever. I am a general manager of an office in Ft. Lauderdale and my passenger worked with me.  I also called the Sun Sentinel and they said there was already over a thousand calls about this sighting.  Then, I called the Washington State UFO Bureau and they wanted a response from me.  I sent a letter with a map showing where the sighting was, a picture drawn by me of these ships and a description, but never received an answer. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
