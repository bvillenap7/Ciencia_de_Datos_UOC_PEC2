IT FLOATED THEN SPED OFF AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED TOWARDS THE NORTH THE OBJECT WAS FAIRLY CLOSE TO ME ABOUT 500 FT IN THE AIR. IT STAYED ABOVE A TREE LINE THEN SPED OFF TO THE NORTH. I ALONE WITNESSED IT AS I WAS WALKING TOWARDS A CANAL TO FISH. IT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSE AND EXTREMELY BRIGHT AND GLOWING. I AM AN AVID ATRONOMY BUFF AND I KNOW ALL THE STARS POSITIONS AROUND THE YEAR. IT WAS BRIGHTER THAN A STAR AT NIGHT AND IT WAS STILL LIGHT OUT. I HAVE NO EXPALANTION FOR THE OBJECT EXCEPT FOR WHAT I HAVE DESCRIBED. I HAD A PHONE CALL A WEEK LATER FROM A MAN IN MIAMI WHO DESCRIBED THE SAME THING HE SAW IN MIAMI ABOUT A WEEK LATER. WHO KNOWS, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.;26.2832;-80.1798
