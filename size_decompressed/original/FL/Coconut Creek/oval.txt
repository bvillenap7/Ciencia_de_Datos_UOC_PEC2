3 orange lights over Coconut Creek, FL.;2016-11-13 21:25:00;2:35 minutes;3 orange lights over Coconut Creek, FL I was walking my dog, when at about 9:20pm, I noticed a bright, pulsating orange light in the sky to the east.  It moved slowly,and occasionally the light would dim completely and I could make out a round/oval silhouette.  The object then turned to the north and vanished entirely.   A few moments later, a second orange light appeared low in the eastern sky.  I started video recording with my phone.  It was exactly like the first - shining brightly then dimming, moving slowly to the north before disappearing.   A few seconds later, a third light appeared.  Its appearance and movement was exactly like the two previous.  I also recorded this one.  The three objects did not make the slightest sound.  My dog did not react other than get a little antsy, but she has a hyper disposition anyway. As far as I could tell, I was the only witness.  However, these lights/objects flew over a golf course on a college campus (Broward College) - so it's very possible that, although it was Sunday night, someone else saw them.   I will send the videos I took of the second and third light/objects.;26.2832;-80.1798
