It was a very and I mean very bright twinkle. We could see it clear being that it was a very clear sky that night. My daughter and just froze in couriosity, as we saw this twinkle in the sky going down in a 45 degree angle that back up again. As it did, it then started to proceed to fly slowly yet smooth. We could see it's shape take form as it flew over. It was diamond shape with lights at each end and more lights cemetrical to to teh shape of the aircraft. We also thought it might of been a rare shaped plane but waht's been bugging us is that at first it just appeared to huver without moving, only getting bigger and brighter, also that it made no sound (not one peep) accross the skies.;26.2832;-80.1798
