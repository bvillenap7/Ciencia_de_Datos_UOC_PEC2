Bright orange/red glowing object that moved from the E to the W across the clear night sky.;2017-04-13 22:30:00;3-4 minutes;Bright orange/red glowing object that moved from the E to the W across the clear night sky. My girlfriend and I were looking up at the stars and noticed a bright orange/red glow in the sky to the East.  It was rather low in the sky, maybe as high as a small prop plane would fly.   It moved from the East all the way across the sky heading to the West, and disappeared on the horizon.  It went right over the house.  We heard a faint sound like a humm.  It never changed in appearance, as it appoached and passed us, which seemed very odd to me.  It had no flashing lights or markers as a plane would.  I thought it must had been a rocket launch from Cape Canaveral or something, but they had no scheduled launches for that night.   I am a regular star gazer, and this event has my mind blown.  I have no idea what it could have been.;28.5379240692643;-81.7604813852804
