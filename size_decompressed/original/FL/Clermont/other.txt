Intense RED mushroom shaped object over golf course lake.;2014-06-07 06:00:00;20 seconds;Intense RED mushroom shaped object over golf course lake. I am 51 year old female up having coffee.  Went for second cup, looking out the front window overlooking lake and saw this mushroom, or umbrella shaped object over middle of the lake.  This was red.  I mean RED!!  I have never seen anything so red in my life.   The top of the mushroom was more intense red than the Stem that flowed out the bottom.  It was about 300 yards away.  I'm guessing the top was about the size of 2 Suvs.  I just stood there for about 10 seconds, stunned.   Then I called out to my boyfriend to come look.  He was sleeping.  It took him about another 10 seconds to get up to look.  By the time he got there, it had gone.  It never hovered or moved around.  It just disappeared.    This was NOT a reflection.  I immediately drew a picture on a napkin with a red pen.  I will never forget the intense color of red!;28.5379240692643;-81.7604813852804

Suddenly, it shot straight up, hovered, then descended back to where I had first seen it.  I got up from my chair and rushed to the railing as it zipped across the sky to the east, where it then flew around in a tight circle maybe seven or eight times.   It then shot clear across the sky towards the west...far enough I had to change positions on my deck to continue watching it.  Quickly, but not as fast as it had just moved, it then flew back to the east and north.  At this point, it was so distant and with the bright Moon, I could barely detect it. I sat back down hoping it might reappear.   A minute or so went by, when it reappeared back in the area where it flew in circles before. It was doing this again, when it suddenly flew back towards the west and stopped roughly where I had first seen it.  Just as quickly, it made what appeared to be a tight angular change (this is when I saw another red light and a blue light).  At this point, it flew back to the east and out of my line of sight. As I sat hoping it would reappear again, I noticed a plane in the southwest.  The speed seemed so much slower and I realized another thing.  The plane made noise.  This object seemed to be silent.;28.5379240692643;-81.7604813852804
