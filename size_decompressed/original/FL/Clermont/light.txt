Every night for approximately a week in mid February, I observed 2 large red/orange lights on the Southern horizon. They were, from my location on the 2nd floor apartments balcony, just above the tree tops but very far away. They would appear for 15 to 30 minutes and then fade out only to reappear a little while later. On more than one night I saw them while driving South on Highway 27 from Clermont towards my apartment which is about 15 miles South of Clermont. I have lived in this same location for 5 years and am familiar with the towers and other aerial lights in the area. I am also very familiar with aircraft and the lights associated with them. These were very different from typical tower, aircraft or other lights I am use to seeing. They were also not the typical color of military flares that are claimed to have caused the Phoenix Lights. After seeing them every night for about a week they disappeared. I still check every night hoping I can catch them again and get some neighbors as witnesses. I wouldn't have reported this if I hadn't found three reports listed for the same time period by people in Florida. All of those sightings confirmed to me the location and strangeness of what I saw.;28.5379240692643;-81.7604813852804
A blinding light caused an electrical disturbance while passing near my car.;2002-02-02 02:53:00;1 minute;A blinding light caused an electrical disturbance while passing near my car. After dropping a friend off at home, I was traveling down Lake Louisa Rd towards Lake Shore Dr in Cermont,FL. I had not been drinking that night nor had I been under the influence of any drugs. I am not one who has ever given thought to mysterious objects or paranormal occurences (in fact, I usually dismiss such claims as insanity or stories told by people looking for attention). As I was traveling down the road, I noticed a bright light on the left side of my car down by the lake, which is kind of downhill from the road. The light was so bright that it was almost like a truck's high beams or a spotlight shining directly in my line of sight. I didn't give much thought to the object as it was just above water level and was just sitting down in the valley. When I started to pass from its view, the light started to approach up the hill and made a slow move across the road above my car. It was now directly over my car, just in front of my hood, I would say at this point it was about 15/20 feet in the air. The light was so bright that I could see nothing but the light. I coudn't see anything in front of me. At this point my '99 Ford Mustang completely died on me! The battery and all. I couldn't get the engine to turn or anything. Dead. I was sitting right below this thing and it was dead silent. I had the window about a 1/4 of the way down and I could hear nothing. It was probably the eariest silence I can ever remember. The light sat there for about 30 seconds or so and finally started moving to my right until it was directly in view of the right side of my car. It took some time for my eyes to adjust and stop seeing spots. But all I remember is having that same bright light to my right and seeing it rise out of view and dart off. It was almost as though it shot off like a slingshot had propelled it at a 45 degree angle. Just like that it was gone. I continued to try and start my car, and, after sitting there for about another minute, it started. It took all I had to catch my breath and try to tell myself ! that I w as okay and to bloc it out as though nothing had happened. I immediately called my parents, and then my girlfriend, and told them each of what had just occurred. They could all tell how anxious and scared I really was. I am 26 years old and I am a collee graduate. I believe in rational explanations to events like these. I cannot think of any, which has me scared. My car is working perfectly and have never had any problems with it. The battery is fully charged. It couldn't have been a helicopter because the light was at a low level and there was dead silence. With the window down I would have for sure heard the helicopter. I am a religious person, yet skeptical of such modern day claims of supernatural events. I really am at a loss for what to make of this.;28.5379240692643;-81.7604813852804
Unusual Light;2007-08-12 00:50:00;10 Seconds;Unusual Light I was outside with my son watching the Perseid Meteor shower, facing roughly east.  I saw a number of meteors, and then noticed a red light about the apparent size of a large star.  It appeared closer than a star and was the color of a red stoplight.  It was stationary for a few seconds, and then it shot to the left.  It left a brief tail and then disappeared.  It seemed to just vanish leaving no trace.  This light looked nothing like the other meteors or stars I saw.;28.5379240692643;-81.7604813852804

I immediately awakened my wife and the neighbors across the street.  We also reported it to the local police who responded and observed the incident.  We watched the lights until the sunrise made it impossible to see them again.;28.5379240692643;-81.7604813852804

I WAS IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE AFTER DINNER, JUST AFTER WORK. I WAS OUTSIDE ENJOYING THE COOL BREEZE ON HT EPHONE WITH MY FIANCE I HAD BEEN TALKING TO HER FOR ABOUT HALF AND HOUR, AND AT THE MOMENT I SEEM TO REMEMBER BEING THE ONLY ONE OUTSIDE ON MY BLOCK . COINSIDENTALLY I LOOKED UP AT ONE POINT WHILE ON THE PHONE AND NOTICE SOMETHING VERY BRIGHT APPEAR ABOUT 2 TO 3 THOUSAND FEET AWAY AND ABOUT AT 1 THOUSANT FEET IN ELEVATION. IN THIS REGION I SEE ALLOT OF LOW FLYING AIRCRAFT ITS PRETTY REGULER. BUT WHAT SEEMED TO CATCH MY ATTENTION WASN’T SO MUCH THE OBJECT BUT THE BEHAVIOR IN WHICH IT MOVED IT. VERY VERY HIGH SPEED AND ALMOST RANDOM POINTS OF EVEN QUICKER ACCELERATION, IN A VERY LINIAR MATTER. I ALSO NOTICED THERE WAS NO SOUND WHATS SO EVER NOTHING NO ENGINE SOUND, OR SONIC BOOM, OR NOTHING COMPLETE SILENCE! IT WASN’T COMPLETELY DARK AT THE MOMENT SO WHAT I SAW WAS CLEAR,( IT WAS A VERY BRIGHT WHITE AND YELLOW LIGHT IN THE SHAPE OF A SHERE, AND AROUND IT A CIRCULER GLOW OF LIGHT ALSO WHITE AND YELLOW BUT MORE TRANSPARENT. ALSO IT SEEMED AT MOMENTS TO EITHER SPEED UP SO MUCH THAT I COULDN’T SEE IT, OR DISSAPEAR AND APPEAR ABOUT TEN FEET FORM WHERE IT JUST WAS.

THEN I LOST VISUAL FOR A BOUT A SECOND DO TO A NEIGHBORS HOUSE, AND THEN COUGHT A DIM RAY OF LIGHT SHOOT UP STRAIGHT INTO THE SKY BUT THIS TIME I SAW NO SHAPE ONLY A DIM RAY OF LIGHT BUT ABOUT 4 THOUSAN FEET LONG AND DISSAPEARED. I HAVE TWENTY TWENTY VISION AND DON’T BELIVE IN NOTHING UNLESS I CAN FEEL IT OR SEE IT!IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THIS TOOK A LIFE TIME BUT DURING  ALL THE ABOVE I ONLY HAD TIME TO SAY “BABY” TO MY GIRLFRIEND OUT OF SHOCK OVER THE PHONE. THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL THIS WAS AN AIRPLAIN OR A BIRD, OR A REMOTE CONTROLLED AIRPLAIN IT WAS SIMPLY WAY TO FAST TO BE ANY OF THE ABOVE.

Spotted 3 red lights triangular in Clermont, Florida.;2013-10-30 21:00:00;21:00;Spotted 3 red lights triangular in Clermont, Florida. I was driving on the way home on 27 highway with my daughter.  I spotted 3 red lights triangular that was in the sky and told my daughter to look at it.  Then one light disappeared and two lights moved closer that made us baffled!   My daughter thought it was probably a chopper but the 3 lights didn't move like airplane and helicopter do.  So, we got out of my car.   To be honest, I am deaf and I can't hear so my daughter heard the sound like boom boom that almost like a firework.;28.5379240692643;-81.7604813852804

They slowly joined to become one.  Initially we thought they were 2 planes on crossing routes except they did not cross.  They remained together for a few minutes.  As soon as I took my cell to record they went northbound at a high rate of speed and disappeared within 3 seconds.   Never seen anything like this!

Orange and white lights cruising eastward toward Orlando.;2019-01-29 05:35:00;90 seconds;Orange and white lights cruising eastward toward Orlando. I was heading east on Highway 50 in Clermont, Florida for work this morning, 1/29/2019 at 5:35 AM.,  Saw a pair of bright lights headed east at around 500’, moving at a speed of about 200 miles/hour. The lights were not flashing, and one was immediately above the other either on a single structure or in very tight formation.  Their relative position to one another did not deviate, and they did not turn.  They drove directly eastward in a straight path into the clouds above Orlando. When it was overhead, I could not see a structure against the black night sky.  I only saw the top light as bright orange, and the lower light as bright white. This structure/formation did not make any noise like a low flying jet on approach.  As I proceeded east from Hwy 50 to the Florida Turnpike, I saw the flashing lights of approaching aircraft from normal planes.  What I saw did not look like these.;28.5379240692643;-81.7604813852804
