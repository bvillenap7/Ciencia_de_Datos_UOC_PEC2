Flyby of an unknown object creating a very low frequency humming / pulsating sound.;2014-01-16 22:00:00;0:10;Flyby of an unknown object creating a very low frequency humming/pulsating sound. A very loud strange humming, pulsating, vibrating noise flew over my house at a very high rate of speed.  I have never heard a sound like this before.   Minutes after the flyby, I began receiving text messages from neighbors within a wide coverage area.  No witnesses to the object making the noise, but it did not sound like a conventional jet engine.  It was a very low frequency pulsating hum/bass sound.;28.5379240692643;-81.7604813852804
Bright orangy object flying close to buildings and trees.;2014-05-04 04:00:00;1-2+ hours;a bright orangy object flying close to buildings and trees. I know there have been several sightings quite like mine...but my encounter was short of exciting.  I was actually afraid I walk in the mornings to work like really early mornings like 4 or 5 in the morning I have been working at a new store in the area.  But anyways this one was quite strange I been seeing these sightings on and off during the past 3 months but Sundays sighting was the worst.  I seen it when I was leaving for work behind my apartment building in Raintree apartments.  Then as I was walking out of my complex I  seen it go towards the old Winn Dixie plaza flying silently in the sky.  I always cross the street right between Cagan Crossings, Wal-Mart and the Chilis. It went down hovering between the Fairwinds Credit Union and Starbucks I crossed the street right before the bank…I was freaked out  it was like 50 ft from me and  it was like 20 feet across and very orangy bright. I couldn’t really tell if it was a disc or sphere shaped I saw a lot of lights it takes me usually 20 - 30 minutes to get to work so as I was getting closer, It then went towards the Wal-Mart n then  as I was walking to my work it went up by the Verizon store but it was higher in the air and  then went back towards the Kentucky Fried Chicken and the heavily wooded area and hovered there until sunrise and went back in the atmosphere...I don’t know if all these sightings are connected to the one 8 months ago in October but this one takes the cake. I hope I wasn’t the only one seeing it because of how low it was to the ground in the area where there are always cars going by.;28.5379240692643;-81.7604813852804
