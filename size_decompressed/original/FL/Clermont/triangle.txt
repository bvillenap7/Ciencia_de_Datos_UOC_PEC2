Very low slow triangular craft with bright white lights.;2014-01-04 23:30:00;15 seconds;Very low slow triangular craft with bright white lights. I was driving to go pick someone up and as I was driving I saw a very low triangular aircraft flying above. It had bright white lights in each corner of the craft.  It was low enough and flying very slow so I could clearly see the outline of the craft itself.  It was a sharp triangular shape.  It was flying the opposite direction from me and when I looked back to try to see it again it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
