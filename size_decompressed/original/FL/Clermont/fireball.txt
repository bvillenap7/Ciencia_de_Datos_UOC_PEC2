very bright ball of fire falling from sky;2011-04-19 22:00:00;6 sec;very bright ball of fire falling from sky While traveling by car north on route 27 from Orlando, Florida, to Leesburg, Florida, near Clermont, Florida, approximately 10:00 pm, a fire ball appeared high in the sky and dropped vertically.   It could have been the size of a trash can lid, but it was difficult to tell the size.  It was definitely on fire but the fire extinguished before touching tree level.  When the fire went out, nothing else was visible to me.   The speed seemed slow for the size of the object falling.;28.5379240692643;-81.7604813852804
Multiple UFOs fly into the sky and disappear in south Clermont, FL;2013-04-01 21:00:00;5-10 minutes;Multiple UFOs fly into the sky and disappear in south Clermont, FL On the evening of April 1st, 2013 (and this is no April Fools joke), my parents witnessed at least 12-14 &quotfireball&quot looking objects go up into the sky, in succession, each following the one before, and each waiting for the one after it.  The objects kept formation, quickly flew towards the east and then disappeared.  This happened between 9pm and 10pm, EST, in Clermont, FL.  My parents were sitting on their back porch, which faces south, and they said that the objects flew up in between Lake Louisa (just south of their house) and Interstate 4.;28.5379240692643;-81.7604813852804
4 mysterious lights over central Florida.;2013-05-16 21:30:00;12 minutes;4 mysterious lights over central Florida. At 21:15 myself +2 neighbors were talking, location was approx. 3 miles south of Clermont Florida. I was facing toward the north, a treeline is positioned approx. 1/2 mile north of my position and tops of structures, including a hospital with a life-flight helicopter can be seen in the distance approx. 3 miles, weather conditions were calm and clear with 10+ miles visibility, upon seeing the first object my reaction was to think it was a helicopter perhaps transiting smoke from some distant brush fire, the nose light was very orange, I indeed stated to my neighbor are there any fires in the area, the Life-flight looks odd. The object was moving east to west at a perceived elevation of less than 1000 ft.  (Based on building elevations)speed appeared to be consistent with that of a helicopter in forward flight, except no noise.  All three of us watched this object, then a second one appeared above the treeline Flying what I can only describe as erratically, changing elevation and direction best I can describe would be a corkscrew flightpath. With both object clearly visible they now had our collective full attention, the second object I perceived to be in trail of the first by approx. 2 miles, then a third became visible, again trailing by about 2 miles, the guessing now started between three of us, a flight of aircraft on afterburner, nope, no noise, perhaps a group of cruise type missiles, we do have a bombing range 30 miles to our west, objects 1,2 and 3 were clearly visible Florida is very flat, I ran to my house and quickly returned with my marine binoculars and quickly brought number 3 into view, it even through the binoculars appeared as an hazy orange elongated ball, my wife arrived home and also observed the objects, then number 4 appeared and the corkscrew flightpath was duplicated except it was about what appeared to be at least 5 miles behind number 3 the only other one still visible.  Light number 4 then went into a flat flight for about 10 seconds and then speed up and transitioned east to west at ! an extremely high rate of climb and speed, 3 then vanished quickly followed by number 4, it did not fade out, but more like flipped the light switch, gone.  Not visible even through some very good binoculars. mysterious event.   56 years old and traveled the world, never have seen anything like this before.;28.5379240692643;-81.7604813852804
Wobbling orange ball light.;2015-03-21 01:15:00;10-15 minutes;Wobbling orange ball light. Stepped out on my deck for a cigarette around 1:15 a.m., and saw a bright orange light.  Thought it was a plane, but it seemed to be wobbling and darting.   It disappeared as it seemed to wobble into the distance.   A moment later, it reappeared where I had originally seen it and followed a similar wobbling pattern.   Again, it disappeared and reappeared a third time.  No subsequent appearances.;28.5379240692643;-81.7604813852804
