I was looking out my front window facing north and I saw a very bright star straight ahead, low, I continued to watch it to see what it was and noticed it was blinking white lights,left to right, blink blink, blink blink, then I noticed two more to the west cruising very slowly, one continued west and the other approched the top of my area, as it passed over head I noticed a circle of small red chaser lights underneath, but the craft seemed to be maybe deltoid, it was dark and it was far up, the white lights were in a circle and the red bottom lights too, which made it seem circular, but the shape was not, it continued to travel at a very slow speed, over my house, and continued south, I want back to the front of the house and noticed another one to the east of the stationary one, still blinking to the north, this one also continued to cruise east, as if it were looking for something, the stationary one eventually moved very slowly north, the only thing that is up in that area were it was hovering is a large lake.;28.5379240692643;-81.7604813852804

UFO traveling from north to south near Clermont, FL area went down, then up, and then disappeared across sky.;2013-12-03 19:45:00;Few minutes;UFO traveling from north to south near Clermont, FL area went down, then up, and then disappeared across sky. I just heard you last night on Coast to Coast AM and started screaming because I thought you were reporting what I saw Tuesday night, and then I realized the sightings were two days apart! My sighting sounds just like last night's in Davenport, FL, except that I live in Clermont (the next town north of Davenport), and it happened Tuesday night 12/3/13, around 7:45 pm EST while I was sitting in my backyard.  The UFO was traveling from north to south in the area west of highway 27! I actually saw it go down for a minute (then it got blocked from view by my neighbors large house), and then it came back up after a minute. It traveled a little more and disappeared.  It was flashing colors from orange to red.  Around the same time a jet airliner with bright red lights showed up.  I found another report from 7/20/13 in Davenport, FL, reporting the same thing, including the jet airliner that came from east to west.  The details were identical to mine!  I saw several other UFOs around the same time also flashing orange to red, but the one that went down and then up really caught my attention because there are no airports in that area so I wondered where on earth he could be going if he was going down to land.  Orlando airport is east of us, the direction the jet came from, but the ufo was in the west.  Nothing there but empty fields.;28.5379240692643;-81.7604813852804
