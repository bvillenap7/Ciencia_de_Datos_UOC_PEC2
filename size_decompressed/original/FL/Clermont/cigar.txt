I heard a small plane engine. As I stood up in the shallow part of the pool I observed it to be a low flying small plane flying east.  As it passed directly over the pool I saw a silver cigar shape almost intersect the low flying small plane at a much higher altitude heading north.  It was heading due north making no sound and showing no vapor trail. I got out of the pool to look at it from a different angle looking for wings I saw no wings it continued north for about another 30 seconds before disappearing into the clouds. The whole episode lasted no more than a minute or two. Afterwards I came inside and hand wrote a statement including the date and time. Later I thought about it and decided to report it.;28.5379240692643;-81.7604813852804
I saw 20+ bright lights cross the sky to the West below the moon.   ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-30 20:15:00;5 Minutes;I was taking the trash out and turned around towards my house and saw 20+ bright lights cross the sky to the West below the moon.  Most were in a straight line one behind the other.  However several were beside one another.  They were moving very fast and once they were to my left they were suddenly gone.  I could tell they were not planes of any sort because they didn't flash and were too close together.  I tried to take a video with my cell phone but onlt got a picture of on of the lights.;28.5379240692643;-81.7604813852804
