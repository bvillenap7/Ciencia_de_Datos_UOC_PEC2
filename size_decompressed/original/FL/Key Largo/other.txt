I was outside smoking a cigarette, completely sober and not sleepy, admiring the thousands of stars in the very dark night sky, when I see what first appeared to be a shooting star.   But I am convinced this could not have been a shooting star because it never burned out and was very consistent in color. I have seen quite a few shooting stars before but never anything like this.   I was looking toward the south direction and noticed it moving very rapidly towards the north-east direction, moving across the center of the sky.   This object was as high as the stars and the size of a star with a consistent orangish color. It moved from one side of the sky to the other in less than 3 minutes!  I was watching it move through the sky, but it moved too far too fast for my eyes to focus on it traveling away from me(I have excellent vision).   After that, I stayed outside for a while longer, looking up, and saw airplanes flying by and compared the object I saw to airplanes. I! am convinced it was not an airplane either. It moved much faster and much higher than any plane. This object had no flashing or blinking lights either. ((NUFORC Note:  Meteors do not last for 2-3 minutes.  Not ISS.  It was visible on this date during morning hours only.  PD));25.082;-80.4486999999999
