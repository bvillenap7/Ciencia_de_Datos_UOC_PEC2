Multiple star like objects moving like ants in the sky.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-02 23:00:00;20 minutes;Multiple star like objects moving like ants in the sky It was a super clear night no clouds about 68 degrees in the keys.  We were looking at this one bright star and it just started moving.  It didnâ€™t seem odd at first being a satellite or something but then it started moving in such strange movements and directions.  It was sort of moving like an ant up there in the sky. It looked like the same size as the other stars, just moving from star to star.  Then it would dim out and reappear across the sky.  This was going on for about 15-20 minutes with multiple sightings.;25.082;-80.4486999999999
