six dim points of light in circular position out in space!;2006-06-06 23:30:00;1 hour+;six dim points of light in circular posistion out in space! It was around 11:30pm at night. I took my dog for a late walk at a marina in Key Largo FL. The clouds had moved from my vantage point and I could see stars. At that moment, With the naked eye, out in space I noticed six points of light in a circular posistion. I know the objects were in space because it was almost as if they were amongst the stars... they were not as bright as the stars they were dim(glowing). The perfect posistion amazed me! they seemed to be slowly floating to the North-East. They also seemed to stop for a period of time and then continue. They never twinkled or changed color. After a while I went inside to call a friend who was also in Key-largo, but he was asleep. I looked out my window and I was shocked to still see them! eventualy the cloud coverage came back and i could no longer see them! did anyone else see this?  Very weird!!!;25.082;-80.4486999999999
