2 strange lights seen over Key Largo;2010-09-09 00:15:00;2-3 Mins.;2 strange lights seen over Key Largo At approximately 12:15 am on the 9th of September I stepped outside to have a few drags on a cigar when something caught my attention in the northern sky, it was a low twinkling light.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  I proceeded to scan the night sky.  Just then I noticed two small twinkling lights of the same size in the horizon dancing and flickering.  They were lower than any star or aircraft that would be in the sky.  Possibly only several thousand feet in the sky.  The one light was more toward the north.  The second light was lower than number one and emitting more of a “sparkle” the objects appeared to be circular in shape.  I watched for approximately 2-3 minutes while the lights danced around each other.  From what I saw I am almost positive these were not satellites or any type of terrestrial aircraft.  The bottom light appeared to be glowing or sparkling a red/orange color.  In one quick instance the bottom light stopped dancing and at an incredible speed too! k off into the sky and disappeared within 1-2 seconds.  By the time I had noticed this, the light that was above the one that vanished had dimmed to nothing.  Almost disappearing like the other. On several occasions I have seen similar things happen the way it did that night. I live in very close proximity to the ocean.  Other people I have spoken with have seen similar occurrences.  I know there is an Air force reserve base 25 miles north and a Naval air station in Key West about 95 miles south. This is just an observation of an event I witnessed.  There may have been another person across the canal who saw the same thing.  I remember seeing some one outside across the canal only a few minutes prior to seeing these strange lights.;25.082;-80.4486999999999
Single bright white object seen by boat captain moving west to east at low altitude/super high speed.;2014-10-07 13:00:00;2-3 seconds;single bright white object seen by boat captain moving west to east at low altitude/super high speed. Small bright white object moving west to east at approximately 500 feet altitude probably 5 to 7 times faster than F/A-18 fighters jets out of Boca Chica base.  No sound.  No smoke plume.   From my vantage point on highway view was Gulf Horizon to Atlantic Horizon.   Object passed across 60% of visible sky in  2 – 2.5 seconds.;25.082;-80.4486999999999
Very fast moving alternating zig, zag strobe lights over Key Largo, Fl;2015-08-05 21:00:00;2 minutes;Very fast moving alternating zig, zag strobe lights over Key Largo, Fl On Wednesday night 8/5/15 I was coming back from my walk.  It was about 9:00 p.m. and had just gotten totally dark.   I was turning the corner from the bike/jogging path, along the main highway, into my subdivision.  I was walking south, when I looked up saw this light.  It was red, white and blue, and blinking like a strobe light.  It was moving quite fast to the east towards the Atlantic Ocean.    I'm right under one of the flight paths to Miami International Airport so I see blinking lights all the time.  This light seemed to be moving much too fast for an aircraft.  This was different.  I thought must be a plane but why is it moving so fast???   It didn't make any noise and I couldn't tell how high up it was and thought..  Drone???  The lights pulsed and flashed like a strobe light.   I walked as fast as I could nearing my street which faces east trying to keep an eye on it. It was moving east and I couldn't keep up with it as it went behind the tree line.  Then standing on my street I was able to catch this extremely fast moving light. It had turned now moving more northerly.  The strobe lights had split into two sections one on the right, the other on the left going on/off alternately. What perplexed me was this was just a single multi-color strobe was now two lights alternating and seemed very wide apart.  I thought maybe a banking airplane, and now I was able to see the lights on both wings.  The lights jumped back and forth in a zigzag fashion.  They weren't on a straight line of sight, as one would see on aircraft wings.  The strobes blinked in an 8 o'clock and 2 o'clock configuration and then changed to a 10 o'clock and 4 o'clock going back and forth.  I only could see it a few more seconds before it was gone behind more trees.;25.082;-80.4486999999999
