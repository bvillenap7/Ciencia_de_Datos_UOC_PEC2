Circular orange dots moving across the sky and then fizzling out.;2013-11-30 20:45:00;10 minutes;Circular orange dots moving across the sky and then fizzling out. There were at least 15, glowing orange, circular dots in the sky.  They were all in one cluster then slowly spread apart.  Once the objects separated they eventually fizzled out (like flares).  Eventually they all just stopped coming and all fizzled out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));26.7107;-80.2324

2 lifesaver-shaped glowing objects in Royal Palm Beach.;2016-04-20 20:30:00;1 minute;2 lifesavor shaped glowing objects in Royal Palm Beach. As I was driving through Royal Palm Beach, I spotted 2 bright objects in the sky, just below the visor in my car.  I ducked down, looked up and saw both clearly.  They were shaped like a lifesavor candy, round and glowing orange.  (with a hole or darkness in the middle)  Both were stationary in the sky, the right one higher up.   Within 20 seconds of spotting the objects, I pulled over to safely observe them.  I exited my vehicle and excitedly called my sister, to see if she could see them from her nearby home.  (She didn't answer, I left a message of what I was seeing on her voicemail)  I then reached in my car for my kindle fire, to try and record this event. (my phone camera sucks)  As I did, the object on the right turned. (like holding a lifesaver candy in your fingers and turning it sideways)  It lost it's glow at this point.  The sides and back were dark with no glow.  It proceeded to shoot off higher into the sky and slightly westward, disappearing within 3-4 seconds.  There was also the slightest blue hue flash, like a quick burst of acceleration from the backside, pinpoint small.   As my kindle fire turned on, the second object then turned sideways/away from me (once again losing its bright orange glow) and followed a similar path as the first object, rising slightly and to the west, again disappearing within 3 to 4 seconds.  The side/backside of the craft gave off no glow, just a slight shimmer of outline from the brightness on the other side.  I was unable to catch either object on video, between pulling over, attempting to call my sister and waiting for my kindle to power up.  The duration of this event was slightly less than a minute.;26.7107;-80.2324
