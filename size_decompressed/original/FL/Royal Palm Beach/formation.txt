Triangle shaped flying object over Royal Palm Beach, Fl;2009-04-01 21:04:00;10-15 seconds;Triangle shaped flying object over Royal Palm Beach, Fl My husband and I were in our hot tub in the backyard as we do every night, and as I looked to the south sky to star gaze I saw a triangle shaped craft with 3 long rectangles on it. We couldn't tell exactly how high it was because the object appeared very large. It was definitely above the clouds, almost seeming as if it was going in and out of the clouds. It traveled from due south to due north. Not making any sound at all, strangely quiet. This object also seemed transparent, the rectangles being the darkest parts. Grey/metallic in color. This object had no lights on it. It took a total of about 12 seconds to cross the entire sky.;26.7107;-80.2324
