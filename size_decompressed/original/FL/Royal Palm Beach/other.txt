I saw something out my kitchen window. I thought it was a large mylar football floating into the sky at first. That was the shape it was. It was moving horizontally to the left and spinning in a clockwise direction. My daughter says it had a light flashing on it, but it looked to me like the sun reflecting as it spun. It was spinning pretty quickly. It was silver in color. It went across the sky and then up. It was daylight and we tried very hard to figure out what it was. About 20 minutes later there were 2 helicopters in sight out the same window.;26.7107;-80.2324
Something unbelievable in the SE FL sky while walking in my neighborhood Saturday night;2009-10-24 20:30:00;1 hour;Something unbelievable in the SE FL sky while walking in my neighborhood Saturday night Running Saturday night around 8ish I looked up on a cloudy night and saw lots of blinking far away objects, some small, others medium, red and white blinking lights way high up in the sky an all over not in one direction. seen by me and my mom.  Some moved slowly across the sky, some moved very rapidly. Also saw large white bands of light flashing across the sky in two different places for over 30 minutes witnessed by me and my mom. Also chased 5 different larger aircraft flying very low under the clouds with red white and possibly blue?  blinking lights.  2 or 3 of the aircraft were V shaped with a possible tail.  The remaining ones had similar lights and were shaped more like a space shuttle.  They were so low I could see their shilouettes on a bright night. They all stayed at the low altitude and moved almost in a large circle in the sky moving so quickly like nothing I've ever seen.  These low flying aircraft made large noises following them from the sound barrier, much louder than a plane.  And they moved much faster than a plane.  I ran to get my mom and she saw all of the phenomenon too.  We finally came inside but the small far away crafts remained, as did the shooting white lights.  I still hear an occassional craft fly over as I type this.  I have never seen a UFO before nor have I seen any government planes or crafts that looked like this.  Some of the shapes perhaps moved together in formati! ons, it was hard to see.  I believe they did follow each other, and others moved in opposite directions than each other.   Very interesting.  I hope someone else saw this too but I'm glad my mom saw it!  I know it's real now!;26.7107;-80.2324
