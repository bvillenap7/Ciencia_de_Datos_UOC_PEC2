I’m an insomniac and that night I could not sleep. As I was staring out the window I saw an extremely bright light. What I saw looked like a comet but without a tail. It got brighter and brighter and closer and closer to land. I could tell that the object was spinning while at the same time it was giving off light from the center. The closer it got to land other lights, smaller lights started appearing near it. They also looked like they were spinning. They seemed to be arranged in groups that were approaching land. In that moment I ran to wake up my family so they could see what I was seeing but by the time they were up the objects had gone farther up into the sky. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Initially I thought they were starts but soon after I knew that they were nothing like stars.;25.4883460732985;-80.4464518324607
