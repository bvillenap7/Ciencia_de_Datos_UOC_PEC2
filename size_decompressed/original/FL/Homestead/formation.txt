It was an object or formation of objects in shape of half moon with a red light in the center and 6 that shaped the rest of the half moon.   Now I major in aviation I know how aircraft look in the dark this wasn't nothing in that nature.  It was going too fast for an aircraft and too slow for a meteor. And as it penetrated a cloud it got dimmer and speed up losing sight of the object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
