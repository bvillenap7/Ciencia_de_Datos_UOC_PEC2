triangle lights with a flash slow moving no sound;1995-06-01 21:00:00;10 minutes;triangle lights with a flash slow moving no sound I was living behind the airforce base, and smoking a cigarette out front and saw this ship of some kind, at first it was like a ball moving slowly but deliberitly straight up and toward where I was.   Then as it got slower, there was no real sound, like you'd hear with a plane or helicopter, but it was triangle with three white round lights on the ends and as it slowly went over me, just past where I lived it made a flash from the center like it was taking a picture.  this has been a while back, but I think if my memory serves it had a light in the center that was red, but not as lit as the other 3 white round lights and when it flashed it still stayed on the same slow path and never did shoot off or anything.   I just assumed it was a plane or something they were testing, but its the most amazing thing I have and had ever scene.
