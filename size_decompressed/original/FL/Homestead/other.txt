Two large fireballs fall from the sky and split into 10 travelling orbs.;2010-02-28 18:40:00;10 minutes;Two large fireballs fall from the sky and split into 10 travelling orbs. My friend and I were driving home from work and noticed what we thought was a large meteor falling from the sky.  The meteor was falling for a much longer duration and was significantly larger that I was accustomed to seeing.  It looked like a burning fireball travelling at a high speed.  It kept falling and then split into two smaller burning fireballs and continued to fall.  Well before it hit the ground each meteor split into two orbs or lights (thus four total) and each light turned and travelled horizontal to the ground.  They were no longer falling.  We then noticed a fifth and all five were travelling at different speeds to the west.  We watched them fly for several minutes until they got so far we could no longer see them.  They did not fly in any formation and appeared to be travelling at different speeds and altitudes.  Next we noticed a second fireball that did the exact same thing.  There were 10 orbs or lights total travelling in two groups of f! ive towards the west.  We watched them for about 5 minutes.  The lights were white with no color.;25.4883460732985;-80.4464518324607
