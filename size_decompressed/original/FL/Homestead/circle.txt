Glowing white circular object seen in the Florida Everglades around 1980.;1980-03-14 20:00:00;1 min + or -;Glowing white circular object seen in the Florida Everglades around 1980. This incident is one of two. This occured near the Everglades Nat'l Park. Me and a friend were having a night time picknick in the Everglades Parks. There was no road, I drove a 4x4 truck east fm US1 into the Everglades.  We saw what appeared to be a Glowing White circular object traveling parallel to the ground about 6-7 feet off the ground. It traveled very slowly. I would estimate around 15-20mph.  It was not a meteor, it was going way to slow. And it was not on fire, just glowing white light. It felt as if it was inspecting us. It emitted no sound.  We watched it go by and we later left. I currently work for Homeland Security. My email is ((e-address deleted)) if you need to contact me.
