Silent Ball of Light going at fast speeds.;2021-07-16 05:40:00;1 minute;Silent Ball of Light going at fast speeds. It was 5:40 AM Friday I was on my way to the car, to head to work. I went to the back area of my house and then saw the ball of light flying south, I noticed it made no sound and there was no indication of flashing light from a plane or helicopter. I ran inside and told my father to look at the object, it flew pretty close to my area at pretty fast speeds he shrugged it off as a satellite but it looked too close to the ground to be a satellite. There is the Homestead Air Reserve Base nearby so I thought it could be a military plane but the object kept flying south, also planes fly in the outskirts of my town in both flight patterns south or north depending on the wind direction but fly rarely above residential areas.;25.4883460732985;-80.4464518324607
