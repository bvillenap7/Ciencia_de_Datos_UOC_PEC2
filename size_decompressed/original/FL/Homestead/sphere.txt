4 extremely bright white, large objects, moving erractically, and extremely fast over Homestead AFB, Fla;2010-02-26 05:55:00;5 minutes;4 extremely bright white, large objects, moving erractically, and extremely fast over Homestead AFB, Fla I was driving on florida turnpike, going south, noticed two, what I first thought were falling stars, bright white light, with trail behind it, came close to ground, about 3 miles west, over the Homestead AFB, when suddenly it burned out, then about 5 seconds later, in the same area, 3 very bright round objects appeared, stationary, maybe 1000 feet high, then suddenly going straight down, with a trail behind it, then disappeared, then seconds later appeared again, about 1500 feet, then two of them moved very fast, up, then to the right, then up, then disappeared, for about 2 minutes, then 4 appeared almost at the same time, again, extremely bright white, round sphere like objects, one of them now moving extremely fast at a 45 degree angle, with, again a trail behind it like a shooting star.  Time was exactly 5:55 am, when I first saw this, total time was about 4 to 5 minutes.  Traffic on turnpike was all slowing down as a result of whatever this was.  I am n! ot a follower of ufo's and have never reported anything like this before, but feel whatever this was, it was not normal to say the least, and very vivid will it be in my imagination for a long time.;25.4883460732985;-80.4464518324607
Bright white sphere coming out of unusual single storm cloud.;2011-10-13 23:38:00;30 minutes;Bright white sphere coming out of unusual single storm cloud. On October 13, 2011 at aproximately 23:38 hours I went out of my home to walk my tree small dogs when I noticed a strange single storm cloud that was at aproximately 45 degree angle north-east from my position. I had my I Phone with me and so I started taking pictures as the lightning inside the storm was unusually fast and colored. It had an aproximately 10 lightning flashes per second with no sound. I called my wife and instead of keep on taking pictures I start recording the event. It lasted about a half an hour. When there was almost no more flashing I observed as a white bright flashing sphere came out of the storm cloud and then split in two white bright spheres. They hover after geting out of the storm cloud for about 10 seconds and then changed course from south to north in a fraction of a second. I am a Law Enforcement Officer and a retired military Infantry Combat Team member and I have seen about all the military has in its arsenal and this does n! ot resemble anything I have seen before. I have photos and footage.;25.4883460732985;-80.4464518324607
UFO over Homestead, Fl.;2013-07-09 21:30:00;10 seconds;UFO over Homestead, Fl. Well pretty much i was chilling with my girlfriend at my neighborhood pool. We were looking at stars when coincidentally we were both looking at the same spot in the sky.  We saw an aircraft.  It had pulsing orb in the back of it acting as the engine i suppose, and it maneuver'd in amazing ways. When we first saw it, we didn't realize it was a UFO.  We just saw how this aircraft was maneuvering some impressive feats that no aircraft today can perform.  It seemed to defy all laws of gravity and maneuver in what way it please, without any fixed projection. The aircraft was able to do a complete 270 degree turn, flawlessly and instantly (the whole incident was quite quick.  So try to imagine this happening in front of you). The aircraft did not move like any Air Plane, or Helicopter.  The feats it performed are quite impossible actually. So pretty much we saw it go from one side of the sky to the other in mere Milli-Seconds.  It did an oval shaped turn, and it had a pulsing orb light coming from the back of the vehicle.  It continue traveling in its projected path and then it disappeared instantly. There is a Military Base (Air-Force) nearby so military testing of new crafts could be one possibility, but from what i saw, i doubt we have anything even comparable.;25.4883460732985;-80.4464518324607
