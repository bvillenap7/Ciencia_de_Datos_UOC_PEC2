Red lights along the side, white light in front,  in a search-like pattern: slow over water, very fast over land.;1997-04-01 21:00:00;2 hours;Red lights along the side, white light in front,  in a search-like pattern: slow over water, very fast over land. I'm filing this because of a History Channel program that referred me to this site, and I stumbled upon a sighting listed here that confirmed one I've been wondering about for almost forty years.  Camper park near Homestead, FL AFB.  Saw something with red lights along the side and a white light in front rise from trees a half mile away.  Rose slowly, then moved horizontally out over the water for about ten minutes at a slow pace.  When it came over land, it moved extremely fast, then slowed down again over water.   It kept up this circular pattern the whole time.  It was visible for over an hour. Made a jet engine whine, but very faint. There was a gravel road built up out of the water (the way they do down there) and the ship seemed to cross it a mile away.  My dad drove us down to look.  We found an Air Force car and a uniformed man who refused to acknowledge the thing we were pointing at.  He said there were just 'some boys out here drinking beer', and he wouldn't let us go any farther.  The craft was clearly visible, but he wouldn't even look over his shoulder.  We drove back to camp, and my boyfriend took a walkie-talkie with him and walked back down the road to see if he could get closer on foot.  The craft crossed over the road above him when I was talking to him on the radio.  The radio cut out, and he came running back in a panic.  The radio worked again as soon as the craft moved on. Eventually, the craft dropped down, out of sight, like a balloon landing.  It was no balloon.  When we asked the campground manager the next day, he shrugged it off. We see a lot of things around here. Nobody pays any attention anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD));25.4883460732985;-80.4464518324607
Witnessed a UFO sighting in south Florida moving very rapidly.;2003-02-24 19:00:00;40 seconds;Witnessed a UFO sighting in south Florida moving very rapidly. I was outside in my front yard at about 7:00 PM it was starting to get dark. I looked up at the sky and noticed what looked to be a star that was moving very rapidly. I called my sons Nicky and CJ to come look and when we came back out we saw it for about another 20 seconds moving to the north and we were comparing it to the stars.It looked very similar. Then it disapeared into the sky.;25.4883460732985;-80.4464518324607

Thought it was a plane on fire crashing. Then before it hit the ground, it seperated into 4-5 objects and flew in different directions and different angles but relatively horizontal.  Objects looked to be moving at different speeds until we could no longer see them.  This occured in homestead florida, near homestead airforce base. Unless this was a military exercise or an air show, I have no other explanation.;25.4883460732985;-80.4464518324607
Large fire shape in Homestead Florida sky. Haze around object seen in photo.;2011-01-02 18:40:00;1 1/2 min.;Large fire shape in Homestead Florida sky. Haze around object seen in photo. Large fire shape in night sky, almost looked missile type, but no con trail behind it. Object flew from the south west horizon to the north west horizon until it was out of sight. I was able to call my step-son of eight years old to come look at the object. He was very scared and said it looked like an asteroid coming to earth. I was able to take a couple of photos of the object, one with a iphone and another 2 with a canon camera. None of great quality. I have seen many objects in the night sky, but this is the first to say I have no idea what the heck this was. Contacted the national weather service to see if any weather instruments where being used in the area. (None) No abnormal weather conditions exist from forecast office out of Miami. Photo- fire like from a missile, but not visible aircraft or con-trail. Haze around fire.;25.4883460732985;-80.4464518324607
UFO Sighting Over Homestead, FL.;2012-02-16 03:45:00;5 minutes each time;UFO Sighting Over Homestead, FL. I got up at 3:45 a.m. because I had to use the bathroom. After using the restroom, I came back to my room and laid down.  I had my bedroom window open.  I got on FB via my cell and was checking my status at this time.  Then I laid back down, and I couldn't fall asleep so I began looking out the window from my bed. This is when I saw a fireball drop from the sky, I immediately went to the window, to see where this object came from and saw, a silhouette of some type of plane gliding silently in the sky.  I could not make out what it was as there were no lights on this object. The fireball was falling, as it fell it split into about seven smaller fireballs.  They look white with a tail, actually they look like falling stars or rather balls of fire.  I thought it was a bomb and that we were under some terrorist attack. I was facing East, towards my parents home.  Actually, the white balls of fire, never touched the ground but, just stayed floating then they disappeared. I tried to wake up my roommate as I was afraid.  Then, I could not sleep, I was worried as my friend wouldn't wake so I stayed in bed looking out the window.  I didn't close it. I observed a small plane circling the area of where this occurred for about fifteen minutes and then it left.  Then, it was almost morning, around 4:30 to 5:00 a.m.  Now it is almost daylight.  Again, this object, came back to the same spot and dropped another fireball down.  I can only tell you that even though it was almost daylight, I could not see clearly the object that dropped this fireball, but only that you could faintly make out that it was some sort of craft, but invisible, no color, no lights and you can see it gliding away right when the fireball drops from it.  Again, this ball of light split into approximately five or six smaller balls of light, they were white.  I can say, I thought it was a comet, or what looks like a comet as when it moved or rather glided it had a tail emitting from the opposite direction. But then I saw these balls of light flying around, and then disappeared for a second time.  Shortly after, now panicked I kept calling my mom, and she was up.  She said that, the only thing she has noticed for the past three days at this hour, including the day of my sighting, was that her house, kept losing power that it felt like something had been draining the power from her home and her lights kept coming off and on and her battery back up would come on.  The lights though would dim she said as if it was being drained. There are several You Tubes that were captured and you can see clearly that they are in the direction of where I stated.  Almost above my parent's home, but high in the sky.;25.4883460732985;-80.4464518324607
Curiosity images reveal UFO;2012-09-29 03:36:00;unknown;Curiosity images reveal UFO I noticed these images scrolling through a Mars Images on my phone.  There are two photos taken from the Curiosity rover on Mars on Sol 53.  The image ID is 402204219 from the left and right NAVCAM.  The two images are recorded at the same time (15:26:34) according to JPL website. One image shows an object in the skyline accompanied by what appears to be a shadow of the object on the surface.  The same picture has a second object in the skyline some distance to the left of the first. The Second picture has only one flying object which is appears in the mountain range.  The other objects are not seen in this picture. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
