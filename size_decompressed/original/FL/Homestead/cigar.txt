We were looking at vultures in the sky circling overhead in our backyard this afternoon and my friend noticed an object that was moving from north to southeast. We watched the object move slowly from almost overhead, then it turned at a 45% angle towards the east and increased to speeds much faster than any of the fighter jets that we have ever seen training near the Homestead Airforce Base. We watched it for approximately 30 seconds until it seemed like a small dot and disappeared into the horizon. The speed was incredible and we guesstamated it to be 6-7,000 mph, and it appeared dark and almost cigar shaped at first, but the amazing part is there was no sound at all or any kind of sonic boom that the jets usually make that exceed the sound barrier!
