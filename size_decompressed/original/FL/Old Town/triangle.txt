Triangle formation in Old Town, Florida.;2012-05-21 23:00:00;5;Triangle formation in Old Town, Florida. It was around 11:00 pm, I was having a party, so everyone was drinking having a good time. A friend of mine let his tailgate down on the back of his truck so we could sit down.  I look up into the sky and I spot 3 white orb like things in a triangular shape.  We were sitting there looking at it for about 3 minutes with no movement, they were just there.  The orb on the right, bottom corner started pulsing in and out of light (well that's what it seemed like) out of nowhere.   Then the top orb disappeared out of nowhere, leaving the two on the bottom alone.  The orbs started pulsing one at a time and the one on the right  seemed to zip off in an unfamiliar way. ive never seen nothing like it.  I tried to follow it with my eyes but in a blink it was gone.  Then the last one standing just disappeared.  I wish I could have recorded it. It gave me a strange feeling, one that I've never felt in my life. In a way it was cool.  I'm glad I got to witness it.
