Silent orange rotating light over McAlpin, Florida field.;1989-09-30 22:00:00;2 minutes;Silent orange rotating light over McAlpin, Florida field. At this time, I was home alone with 3 small children which had been put to bed.  We had 5 outside dogs that began barking up a storm.  There was a large fenced pasture behind and adjacent to our property, with a tree-lined driveway leading toward and then turning to parallel this pasture. I went out of my front door and rounded the corner of the house facing the pasture and didn't see anything.  I saw the dogs sitting side by side and barking in the direction of the pasture.  I walked closer and past the dogs (who did not move forward with me).  I thought it odd that the dogs did not come with me to investigate.  When I had moved a few steps closer to the pasture, I saw a large orange light that seemed to be slowly rotating the circumference of an object.  The object itself, I could not see againt the night sky.  The light seemed to move from right to left, disappear momentarily as if on the back side of the object, and re-emerge on the right again.  I also noticed that the object itself seemed to be silently moving in a forward, downward and zig-zagging motion (closer to my property).  I ran back into the house and locked the doors.  I called my husband who was bowling with friends, and he scoffed as I explained what I had seen.  I was terrified, and realizing he wasn't going to come home immediately as I had hoped, I instead called a friend long distance, and stayed on the phone with her for well over an hour until he did arrive home.  I did not report the sighting to any authorities for fear of ridicule. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));30.149;-82.9686
