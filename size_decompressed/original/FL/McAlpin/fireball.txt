two firery lights emmitting debris with an aircraft neerby;2000-11-14 20:25:00;5 sec;two firery lights emmitting debris with an aircraft neerby about 20:25 on 11-14-00 my wife and I heard a jet aircraft flying and looked up to the east of us and saw two possible fireballs descending similar to a shooting star but they were different then the usual ones we see . One was descending faster then the other and what was strange we did not see the aircraft at that time we thought it might have blown apart or something but as soon as the glowing yellow streeks vanished the aircrafts beacon turned on passing over the same place where the objects were seen;30.149;-82.9686
