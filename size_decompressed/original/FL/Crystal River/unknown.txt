I found some molten materials @ job site.  It happened last night where neighbors noticed something smokin in the ground.  There where two holes in the road..  It appeared to be about the size of a baseball in one hole and smaller in the 2nd.  It also burnt a line in the dirt near by.  This was asphalt road, the 1st hole was disrupted about 4 x 5 and the other about 1 x 1.  The material is different sizes and shapes. Some one handled the material and felt a burning sensation on the hand with a purpilish color. Where can I seek more info about this and who can look @ the material.;28.885071875;-82.64581875
