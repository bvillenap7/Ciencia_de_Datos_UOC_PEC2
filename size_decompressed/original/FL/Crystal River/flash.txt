All of a sudden a bright green flash of light passed through the room. Entering from the front window of the house and exiting at the back of the room. The light was like a ball of green light passing through the room like a lazzer ..It was about the size of a football and left a trail which vanished quickly.. What was it??? We all saw it and were completely taken aback. Nothing else has happen since. I would like to know what we saw and if anyone else has had a similar experience.;28.885071875;-82.64581875
