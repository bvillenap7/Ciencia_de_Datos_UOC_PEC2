Strange orange spheres appear over Crystal River,FL.;2013-06-22 21:20:00;15 minutes;Strange orange spheres appear over Crystal River,FL. Starting around 9:20pm an orange glowing object with blinking lights started out of the south, maybe from the Macdill Air force base area.  The object proceeded north and passed directly overhead, at which point the orange glow and the blinking lights went out and the object disappeared.  There was absolutely no sound. About 5 minutes later 2 more craft of the same description appeared and took the same path. I had another observer with me at this time.  Neither of us have ever seen any craft like this before and he said he lives by St Pete airport and sees aircraft all the time.  These crafts orange glow and lights went out directly overhead as well. At this point I went inside to tell my fellow worker about what the hotel guest and I had just seen.  She was a little skeptical as to be expected.  I then went back outside and saw a fourth object approaching. I ran inside to get the other employee, she said what the heck is that.  The guest and I said we don't know.;28.885071875;-82.64581875
