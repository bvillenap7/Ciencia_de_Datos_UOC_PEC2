Green light pursued by several unmarked helicopters.  ((anonymous report));2019-04-07 19:00:00;10 minutes;Green light pursued by several unmarked helicopters. Distracted by thunderstorms, I pulled into the lot at the mall, that would be Santa Rosa Mall.  It was approximately 7 PM when my attention was drawn to the south, towards a green light.  The light, which appeared point size at first, and then more oblong, sped northbound, almost as if it were following the highway. Several minutes later there was a sound like thunder, a low rumble.  Again, my attention was drawn toward the southern horizon.  Only, it wasnâ€™t thunder. Instead, four huge helicopters appeared to come in low off the beach and proceeded to fly inland at high speed.  They flew from south to north, staggered one across from each other, and followed the same route as the green light had travelled. The helicopters were dark in color, not exactly black, but more of a glossy navy blue, and each bristled with refueling booms and radar domes.  They appeared to be unmarked, and as they past east of me, in the vicinity of the highway, the beat of the rotor wash was enough so that I could feel it against my chest.
