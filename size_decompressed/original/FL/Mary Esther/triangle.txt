While observing shooting stars in the western sky, we noticed what looked like a very bright and colorful planet. The planet began to move twords our position and passed over us. When we first saw the object it was pulsing-red,blue,green,purple,pink, yellow these pulses gave the object a white light characteristic.. as the object got closer to us, we could see it had a slight triangular outline. As the object got closer and passed above us we could see it was not one large pulsing light but a combintion of 4 lights. 3 lights in each triangle corner and a large clearly pulsing light(that seemed suspended inside the center of the object.The object moved slowly and stopped above nearby Eglin AFB. The craft then lowered it's altitude. We could not see if the object landed, trees obscured our view.;30.406;-86.7348
Triangular craft witnessed in fort Walton beach;2019-04-09 21:00:00;15 seconds;Triangular craft witnessed in fort Walton beach I simply stepped outside to walk to the park off of Holmes blvd and jonquil near Santa Rosa mall and just happened to look up and could clearly see a defined slim triangle with six round dimly orange glowing lights also in the shape of a triangle, flying low, id saying 100-150 ft above the tree line, it was moving very slowly and quietly,  I couldnâ€™t believe my eyes and watched it continue on its path (towards Navarre/ gulf breeze/ hurlburt AFB) for as long as I could before it disappeared over the tree line.  Like I said it was dark, just passed 9:00 probably about 9:20 or so but the craft was so low I could distinguish its triangular shape unmistakenly.  I spent the next hour in the park starring up at the sky, in shock, and when I finally got home and tried to go about my normal business I discovered the internet was down in the neighborhood as well.;30.406;-86.7348
