Slow moving, then hovering red/orange glowing object in the sky;2020-11-05 18:26:00;15 seconds;Slow moving, then hovering red/orange glowing object in the sky The photo was taken at 6:26pm on 11/5/20 looking East, in Levy County, FL. I was walking my dog and saw a slow moving, red/orange glowing object making it’s way across the sky.  I thought it must be a meteor, until I realized the object had stopped moving, and was hovering...that’s when I pulled my phone out to take a picture. I was unsure if it would come out clearly since the recent time change makes it quite dark by 6:30, but my phone’s night lens captured it.  Then, I thought perhaps it’s a military drone? The photo makes it appear as though it was in motion, but it wasn’t I assume that effect is due to my hands shaking while taking the photo in Night Mode on my phone with a 3 second exposure time. I looked down at my dog, looked back up again and it was gone. The whole “event” lasted approximately 15 seconds.  If it hadn’t stopped moving completely and then disappeared, I would’ve been satisfied with the possible explanations I wrote above...but since I can’t explain this, I figured I should report it.;29.2845;-82.4913
