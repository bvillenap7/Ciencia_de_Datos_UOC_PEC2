Was moving slow in our back field about 50 feet off the ground.  No noise, no scent and no wind.  Horses were spooked.  Headed WNW about 2-5 mph.  We live on a farm and know all the neighbors. No children and no drones. The land is wood fenced and flat pasture. Several 30-40 foot pine trees surround the whole property. We watched for a minute and ran inside. 3 minutes later we went back out to see if we were crazy and it was only about 20 feet closer.;29.2845;-82.4913
