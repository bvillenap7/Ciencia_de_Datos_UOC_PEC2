A flying micro object hovering by my house.;2019-07-06 23:17:00;30 seconds;A flying micro object hovering by my house. Checking my security cameras the next morning, I noticed a small linear shape hovering close to my daughter's room.  The image looked like it has 5 lights.  I spent a number of hours looking at mini-drone/personal drone models, but could find none even remotely similar to the flying micro object.   We live in rural Florida and the minute long video I am emailing shows no one in the area is even awake or out and about.  This is not a typical flying saucer in the sky moving quickly, etc., but it is an anomaly.  I am inquiring to see if there are other such occurrences.   Thank you.
