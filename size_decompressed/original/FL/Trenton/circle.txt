Round object in night sky with flames encircling it.;2008-10-15 21:00:00;3-5 minutes;Round object in night sky with flames encircling it I was driving west on CR 232 near CR 337 after class at night.  Sky was clear, and stars were visible, a night that would be great for star gazing, no clouds or moon that I remember.  No towns with 10 miles of me (local unincorporated town named Craggs), and no street lights within about 20 miles of me.   A single object in front and to my right, up an unknown number of feet (over 50' at a minimum) of the ground caught my eye.  It was round, completely black in the middle and had what appeared to be orange flames around it.  CR 232 dipped, and I had lost sight of it above the treeline, when the road came back up.   Thinking it was something else, like a radio tower, I came home a different way the next few nights I had class.  Where the towers are eliminated the idea it was the antennas I had seen.  I have lived out here for 10 years, and this is the only time I have seen anything like it.  I had the driver's side window open, so the only noise I had heard was from the wind.;29.6175;-82.821
