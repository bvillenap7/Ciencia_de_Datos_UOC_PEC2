Object portal exit;2010-11-14 18:40:00;12 seconds;Object portal exit November 14 2010 6:40pm Trenton Florida   I was outside looking at Jupiter and noticed planes flying south to north. The planes were spaced about 2 minutes apart and were clearly visible.  In the gap between planes I noticed a brightly lit object moving in the same northern direction. This did not appear to be a plane as it had no flashing marker lights and appeared to be flying faster than the airliners I had seen.  For about 8 seconds it continued its northerly direction when it suddenly slowed to an almost stopped position.  It then abruptly changed its course to the east and accelerated to an extremely fast speed.  Two seconds later a very well lit circle formed in front of the object and grew to a size larger than the object. The object entered this and vanished, and the lit circle shrank and then vanished itself.  Four seconds later I observed a similar object traveling in the same northerly direction, and that object increased speed and disappeared from view over the tree line.;29.6175;-82.821
