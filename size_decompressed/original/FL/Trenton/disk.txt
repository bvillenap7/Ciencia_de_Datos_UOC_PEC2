Flying saucer and a C130 at low altitude;2020-07-10 17:30:00;5 minutes;Flying saucer and a C130 at low altitude On this afternoon, the sun was still relatively high in the afternoon sky.  I was walking towards my front porch and looked up.  I seen a flying saucer with a silver metallic color. The saucer was flying from North to South.  I yelled  look a flying saucer my wife immediately looked up and seen the saucer.  The saucer did have red and green lights on the side.  The craft was at a height of approximately 1000ft.  Soon after witnessing the event the saucer flew over clouds and out of sight.  Less than 5 minutes later, a military aircraft also came buzzing at a low altitude, also over my home but from West to North East.  The plane appeared to be a C130, the C130 wasn't very high above the tree line, I climbed towers higher.  I estimate the altitude was 300 feet or less When it flew over I could not make out any identifiable markings because I only had the ability to observe the underbelly, red and lights blinking and a yellow light also joined in blinking on both sides.  I immediately thought that perhaps the c130 had something to do with that saucer.  I believe it was the Friday of the weekend I listed , but potentially could be that Saturday.  Later that night, I witnessed a significant amount of activity. Blue/purplish flashes, with many lights traveling east to west.;29.6175;-82.821
