A green and yellow object traveling at a high rate of speed;2003-10-20 20:45:00;15 seconds;A green and yellow object traveling at a high rate of speed On Monday evening at 8:45pm my Fiance and I were driving north on highway 301 in Hampton, Florida. As we looked north into the night sky we saw what appeared to be an explosion high in the sky. A second later we saw a sphere shaped object the was yellow on the inside and green on the outside. It seem to pause for a second, then it started falling at a tremendous rate of speed. It had a firey tale as it fell. It appeared as green flames formed a tale of the back. The tale had an angle. It traveled at a 45 degree angle. It was there then it was gone. We heard no reports of any type of crash in our area. I have reported this incident to NORAD as well. I saw the same type of report from two police officers in Raliegh Durham North Carolina.;29.8593;-82.1473
