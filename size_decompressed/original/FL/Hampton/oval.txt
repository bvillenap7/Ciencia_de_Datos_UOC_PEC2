Wile I was on my way over to my grandmother’s house I noticed a blackish oval with a orange glow/light around it. So I went back inside and told my grandmother what I saw and grabbed a pair of binoculars and we headed back outside. I peered through the binoculars and could barely see it, then I walker closer and peered back into the binoculars. What I saw was a circular-oval form of object with a glowing light around it. The light had an orange hue. Then it completely disappeared from view, I asked my grandmother to check it out and she said she didn’t see it anymore either.  We both thought that was weird, I took the binoculars and I saw it zoom to the right and came back to its old position and then disappeared from view again.;29.8593;-82.1473
