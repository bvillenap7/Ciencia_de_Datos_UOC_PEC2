Two bright circle lights seen in West Palm Beach, Florida.;1998-03-07 18:45:00;5 minutes;Two bright circle lights seen in West Palm Beach, Florida. I saw two balls of light, which I commonly describe them as headlight-sized to others. One light was higher than the second light, and to the left of it. The lights were headlight-sized from my vantage point, but were incredibly high. Because of my perception of height, I had judged the lights to be much larger than any aircraft known to man, possibly being hundreds of feet in diameter. I did not observe any contrails or vapors eminating from the lights. The time of day was beginning to turn to twilight and the skies were blue. I was driving eastbound on Forest Hill Blvd and first witnessed them around the intersection of Jog Rd. At first, the lights appeared to be static, just staying in one place. Then, the lights appeared to begin to rise slowly upward and began to fade in intensity. The lights then disappeared, but there was an incredibly large hazy halo left behind for each light. The lights were gone before I reached the intersection of Military Trail. For weeks afterward, I tried to find further information on this incident. I did recall some online articles trying to discount it as military missiles, which from experience could not have been fired from Cape Canaveral. I think the article went on to say that it was ship fired missiles and another article said they were missiles fired over the Florida Panhandle from one side to the other side. Problem being, that I did not witness any East, West, North, or South movement of the lights. I did not witness any vapors or contrails. The only thing those lights did was appear to remain static at a great height, then rise straight up. My life experience is U.S. Military and Law Enforcement.

It reversed course which proved it wasn't a satellite or airplane. Also, it was going to slow to be a meteorite, but still pretty fast. I was looking around the constellation Canis Major(particulary around the star Sirius) through my telescope. My telescope is an 8 inch newtonian reflector, I was using the 25mm lense, if that helps at all. The background was a few stars seen only through the telescope and of course, space. The object zoomed across my line of vision, I could tell it was going very fast, but it was far away. It didn't flash across so it definitly wasn't a meteorite, which would have been disproved anyway by the fact that it reversed course. I was by myself. This was in the south and slightly to the east, and like a said around the constellation Canis Major which would put it about 50 degrees above the horizon. At first it was heading down at an angle, but when it reversed it's course it was heading up at the same angle. It was a very short sighting. I happen to be an aviation enthusiast and know for a fact there is no way it was any KNOWN aircraft. The fact that it reversed course rules out it being in orbit as well. I know I'm stumped.;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908

When I focused on the area I saw a dark disc that looked completely out of place.  As I strained my eyes to continue to focus it vanished.  I had no idea who or how to report this and this was the first website that appeared.    Has anyone on the east coast of Florida had a similar experience today?

Craft was round and gave off an extraordinary amount of light.;2013-08-06 20:00:00;10 minutes;Craft was round and gave off an extraordinary amount of light. At first i noticed the object flying over downtown, And as it got closer to my location it speed up and had light around it like a shield of some kind it looked like it was breaking through a barrier of light.  Me majoring in Aerospace Engineering knew that this was not a plane,not believing my eyes i ran down the street to ask the 3 gentleman that casually stood out in front of their home if they see what i am seeing and they laughed and told me they thought it was just them seeing this. As we spoke i took pictures of the object as it flew at high speed in a big curve as if about to land.  Then it breaks apart into 3 more little craft not as big but even brighter than the first.   As we stared in disbelief the crafts flew over the local Elementary School and all of their lights begin to dim like candles then we couldn't see them anymore due to this was at night.  Then one of the three neighbors pointed up at where the crafts previously were and we noticed this strange cloud left behind that stood out from any cloud we've ever seen.  This cloud was glowing blue and the glow made it standout in the darkness.  This went on for about five minutes as the cloud slowly disappears leaving no evidence of this event happening.;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908
Circle inside circle super fast no noise;2013-12-13 23:00:00;30 seconds;Circle inside circle super fast no noise This actually scared me. It was a huge circle of light above the cloud line.   Once it passed over an opening in the clouds it got super bright it had another smaller circle in the middle.  It had no noise that came with it and no wind or anything u could think.   It was gone in a matter of seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908

Pulled over.  Got a pic, then film.  It disappeared.   Then there were three coming from the same direction going the same way.  Then two.  Same thing.  Then another.  Then another.  It was me and 4 children in the car that saw the sighting.   My Husband saw it from our neighborhood not too far from where we were and two of our neighbors saw one of them as well.   I have 2 or 3 videos.;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908
