Small saucer hovering over house then shooting into sky.;1977-06-15 15:00:00;17 seconds;small saucer hovering over house then shooting into sky. It was 1977, and my girlfriend and I were walking down the street in our neighborhood. I looked up while we were talking and I saw a small saucer hovering over the top of a small house.  I told her to  Look at that, I said no-one is ever going to believe us. It couldn't have been more than 4-5 feet above the roof of the house.  These houses were very small three bedroom houses in comparison to the houses I see now.  It was pretty much exactly the same size as the roof of the house. I felt it knew I saw it and it took off towards the sky FAST up and off to the right, it made no sound at all and had two lights on the bottom, but I'm not positive what those colors were. In one blink of my eye it was so far up in the sky, in two blinks it was a dot and by the third blink it was gone.  I couldn't believe what we had seen. I wanted to go to that house and ask what had happened to them, but was too scared.  I was a teenager at the time and it was very strange that my friend and I only walked around the block to our friends and by the time we got there had forgotten it.  It took  thirty years to remember. I wonder if it could have done something to my memory.  I know without any doubt it knew when we fixed our eyes on it and took off. I have told many people in my lifetime and they all give me that look and I have to remember that just because they are my friends doesn't mean it's easy for a person to swallow.  Anyway, I feel at fifty that it would only! be fair for whatever it's worth to whoever may want to hear it and listen.  I don't know if it was from here or somewhere else, but they are there..most uncomfortable to see. I think now that I'm writing this I'm going to go back to that house and see if I'm lucky enough to find someone who lived there at that time and ask them if something happened to them that year.

A beam of light that resolved into 40 to 50 flying disks, outside of our atmosphere, with stars seen through their formation.;1983-02-15 01:00:00;2 minutes;A beam of light that resolved into 40 to 50 flying disks, outside of our atmosphere, with stars seen through their formation. I was in West Palm Beach, at the Hilton on Singer Island, for a very important job interview, the next morning.  Myself and three others were interviewed to be the executive team to start a hotel chain for the King of Saudi Arabia. I was alone that night as my room partner had his own evening plans.  He was also one of the interviewees. I went down the beach about 1/2 mile to a restaurant and had a beer at the bar. I only finished half of it because I didn’t want any chance of effects the next morning.  I walked back down the  beach to the hotel, which was right on the beach.  Our room opened to the beach.  I sat in the sand to think and gather thoughts about the interview.  I was staring at the ocean when I saw what looked like one of those search lights that you see crossing the sky, shining out from the horizon.  I thought there must be a ship with a light out beyond the horizon.  But then the beam of light broke off from the horizon and traveled toward me and land.  It was now a beam of light flying along by itself.  I watched it approach and as it did the beam resolved into disks, as it got closer.  I presumed the light was from the crafts reflecting the suns light from around the globe. As they approached I was able to see about 40 to 50 disks flying in a group sort of formation.  As they approached land the formation changed to two lines with ships within the lines, and turned south.  There was about eight large ships and the rest smaller...about 1/4 the size of the larger.  I could see the stars through the formation.  These crafts appeared to be in space, not in our atmosphere. As they flew overhead I saw one of the smaller disks fly to or into one of the bigger ships.  When the formation reached over land they turned south as if to follow the beach south.  They continued south and as they did, they changed back into the wider pack formation. Their resolution faded back into a glowing beam and they disappeared south. Right about the time they were passing overhead my room mate got back.  I could hear him and so I shouted for him to come quickly.  He did but not in time to see any more than the beam of light traveling south. This was a crystal clear, warm night.  What I saw was clear as could be and there was no mistaking what I was looking at.  My demeanor was calm, sober and totally clear headed. What I saw changed my life.  I’ve never had any doubt as to what I saw and the memory hasn’t faded.  I reported it to a group who’s name was an anagram from Ohio.  Teroco?  Or something like that.  I also did a report on the Sci-Fi Channel website, around that time. I’d love to hear from someone about the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

UFO here in florida. 4 witnesses no BS.;2004-02-11 00:00:00;20-30 minutes;UFO here in florida. 4 witnesses no BS. Well, It was around 11:50 when they called me to the balcony to go see it. At first i thought it was a plane, Cause well were talking about a UFO here. So, i look out and it has a orange shade/glow. It was oval/plate shapped. The other witnesses told me before it came it was seriously really close to them. When i went it was about 4-5 miles away from me.  Little by little it started to fade, Than when it did i kept staring at its location it had disappered. When it moved from one location to another in a quick flash. Leaving a lightening type fade from its movement it kept doing this for about 5 more minutes when it finally dispeared. Me and my house mates were amazed. Trying to sleep, but still a little shaken.;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908
