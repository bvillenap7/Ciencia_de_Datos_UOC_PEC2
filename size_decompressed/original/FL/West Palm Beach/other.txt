Bright burning object with tail originating in northern sky heading east.;1998-11-22 19:00:00;5 minutes;Bright burning object with tail originating in northern sky heading east. Orangeish colored object with a tail originating in the northern sky.  Lost tail on the way heading east.  Regained tail briefly in the northeastern sky then seemed to explode. ((NUFORC Note:  The description seems to us to be not inconsistent with a contrail behind a high-flying aircraft, which is reflecting the setting sun.));26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908
Palm Beach County sighting, strange light;2006-11-20 21:00:00;2 minutes;Palm Beach County sighting, strange light I was in the car with a friend/classmate in rural Palm Beach County, FL.  About 10 miles away from highly populated area.   This object was seen by itself, only 2-3 times higher than a tall overhanging streetlight and approximately 1/2-1/4 mile away.  From a distance it almost looked like there was lightning or some electrical activity going on underneath the object.   The object appeared to be semi-spherical, had bright lights.   Flashes of light near the ground leading me to believe this object was responsible.  (The ground was lit up in the area underneath the object in rapid, short bursts of illumination).   The object itself did not appear to be moving, if it was it did so very slowly.   After we we able to get up close, the object (while not moving off its axis) rotated downwards 45 degrees pointing straight at the ground and then disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908
Blue U shape light moving slow and suddenly speeding up.;2014-03-02 19:00:00;2-3 minutes;Blue U shape light moving slow and suddenly speeding up My daughter (3.5 years old) and I were going West bound on Okeechobee Blvd in West Palm Beach, FL.  We were standing at a red light on Okeechobee Blvd and SR7 corner in the left turning lane.   I saw a blue light coming East toward the beach.  We have a lots of air traffic because of the West Palm Beach International Airport, but I never noticed a steady blue light on any aircraft before.   First I thought is some reflection on the windshield, but when it was over us, I rolled done the passenger side window and stick out my head. It was right above us. It was a U shape steady blue light, going slow to the East, then suddenly it speed it up so fast that is just not possible.  Then, we were going toward to South on SR7 and I was still seeing it on the North side.  It was going very slow then suddenly changing directions and speed up so fast that is just not possible.  It was above us for 2-3 minutes.   Then, we arrived to the restaurant (PeiWei) at Forest Hill and Wellington Greens corner at Wellington Mall.  We went in but the food was not ready yet.  We went to the restroom with my daughter, stayed there for 3-5 minutes, then went back,  picked up the food, walked to the parking lot, and left.   As soon as we turned on to Forest Hill Blvd  Eastbound, Immediately on the left (North side) I saw it again going slow to the North.  I grabbed my phone try to make a video, its speed it up very fast and I didn’t see it anymore.  All the way home I was looking up, hoping not to crash my car, but didn’t see it anymore.  It is 100% that other hun! dreds (if not thousand) of people must have seen it.   If you have a other information please let me know what was that. I do not believe in UFOs but I cannot came up with any logical explanation. Best Regards, ((name and contact information deleted));26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908

The sky was very clear except for some downward looking wisps about 5 of them separated equally with the same size of separation as their actual size and they were positioned North North West of my location as well as being the actual geographicly.it was as I was looking at this particular formation I noticed 2 high flying birds possibly hawks in the same area. It was then that I saw something just silently hauling ass in a near perfect westward direction. At first I thought it must be a third bird but I also noticed it was lighter in color and seemed to be moving incredibly fast and like I mentioned in a perfect line westward. I spent a few seconds trying to focus on better on the object I couldn't tell if it was small or larger and further away or at a much much higher altitude than a normal passenger aircraft. I've been in the military and it did not resemble any fighter jet mannerisms! at all. Upon continuing to focus in i could see the shape almost disc saucer like but more like a streamed down shape of an egg laying in its side almost like a sleek teardrop on its side fat end would be the rear end and point would be the front.  There was no chemtrail or exhaust if you will.  This had to all of it take less than a minute of actual viewing of the craft. Like I stated it was hauling ass and so perfectly straight.  That stood out to me a lot for some reason.  The craft also was a light grey/silver in color it seemed and I also recall that it had that metallic sheen to it somewhat reflecting the sun light to some small degree and it was doing so correctly in relation to the sun's current position in the sky.  It actually took longer for the facts of what I saw to finally click than the event itself lasted lol.  It was incredible plain sight clear day..  I only wish I had grabbed my phone camera but it was so so fast the moment would have been lost trying to fumble! with the phone and zooming in etc.  It's memory was so vivid and intense that I just had to find out if anyone else saw it and I've never thought of reporting one let alone seeing one. But I am compelled to make this report.  My first one ever..;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908
