SIGHTING AFTER HURRICAN IN FL;2004-09-06 23:00:00;2 minutes;SIGHTING AFTER HURRICANE IN FL After one of the big hurricanes that hit FL, once we returned to the apartment after 4 days of evacuation.  I took the garbage to the complex' dumpster, it was about 11 pm. it was silent lonely and cloudy.   As I walked to the dumpster I looked to the sky  I saw some lights that at the biggining I thought were like from an helicopter as the object approched more (it was very hight) at an speed that a normal place would reach, I saw with astonishing that the shape was not that of an helicopter, as it approached the area I was in (near the called intracostal between North Palm beach and singer Island)I saw the real shape above, it was an oval and i got astonished when I clearly saw that the oval underneat had an spiral and it rotated as giving impulse to the ufo or so, I do not know.  3 things called my attention.  First, there was no noice and that made me stare at the object when approaching and Second, as the object approached, what I thought therewere lights, might have been the bright of the top part of the object, therewere no flushing lights or so the third thing is that as the object cleared my location and I could saw completally the underneat shape (oval and spiral)and it was not bright, like from a different material, the color was dark could be easily disgazed and camuflated in the clouds, as if purposely it had been colored to disguised in the dark clouds. All this ended in about 2 mins but was like the time stopped. The object did not follow me or stopped, just kept flying its destination somewhere west.  I tried to look someone was near me but nobody was arround as witness, just me. passed but no body was near me.;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908

At around the same time I noticed a small helium balloon (such as a party balloon) floating by up in the sky and decided to take a few pictures of it just on a whim.  After I shot the first picture of the balloon I noticed (through the view finder) a small white object moving rapidly from left to right within the view finder.  I quickly tried to take a second photograph of the object but was unable to as it vanished before I could focus on it accurately. However, when I came upstairs and uploaded all of the images I had taken into my computer I noticed that the second picture I took of the helium balloon had the strange white object within its frame.  I couldn’t help (and still can’t help) but wonder what the object could have been, as it flew very quickly and completely silently before it disappeared.  The sky was also very clear and there was no other air traffic that I could see within my vicinity. The photograph of the object was taken with the following settings: Shutter Speed:  1/320 sec. Aperture: F6.3 ISO Speed: 100 Lens:  75-300mm Focal Length: 300mm  I took the photo and simply increased the contrast on it so you could see the object a little brighter, however I will make sure to email both the original untouched picture as well as the contrast enhanced version.  I hope you folks can figure out what this is because I certainly have no clue as I have never seen an object of this shape in flight.;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908

Low flying object flying extremely fast along the coast heading south, West Palm Beach.;2019-11-02 21:30:00;4-5 seconds;Low flying object flying extremely fast along the coast heading south, West Palm Beach. I saw what I first thought was an aircraft.  But it was flying much too fast.  There were no flashing lights, as most aircraft have. It was flying low, just on the horizon, from north to south paralleling the coast.  It was beige/off white in color and hazy.;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908
