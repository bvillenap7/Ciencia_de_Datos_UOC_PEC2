Red balls coming out of object !!!;2004-06-02 23:55:00;5 minutes;Red balls coming out of object !!! I live in West palm Beach, FL at on June 2nd at approx. 11:55 pm I walked outside. I noticed to my SouthWest a bright object and at first I thought nothing of it because I live near the airport. However I kept noticing that it would get really bright and then go dim to the point where I couldn't see it. I also noticed that it wasn't moving much. I was trying to be rational but when I went and grabbed my binoculars I saw something about this light that was pretty amazing ... I saw 6 or 7 small red balls of light shooting downward out of this light or whatever it was. I then remembered a UFO documentary that I saw one time but I can't remember which one but it was exactly like the video that I saw on that show. The video showed exactly the same thing I saw and I remember in that video there were several people watching and making comments as these red balls of light were dropping/ shooting out of this object. Of course I called several newstations and at the time I called they had no reports of this but I clearly saw the red balls of light dropping out of the light or object.

Possible UFO sighting. Need clarification.;2009-10-05 00:00:00;brief;Possible UFO sighting. Need clarification. December 23, 2001    To whom it may concern,   On or about October 5, 2009 I was outside at night and became interested in taking a photo of the moon through some over-hanging trees. The moon was full or nearly so, the sky was a bit misty, and it looked like it would make an interesting shot. There was a very dim incandescent yellow light behind me. I was shooting with a digital camera and had the flash off. The camera was set on auto-focus. Because it was dark I couldn’t be certain I had correct focus, and the camera was hand-held so I couldn’t be certain I was holding it still enough to preclude blurring. I took 6 or 7 shots right in a row, over the course of about a minute, without changing position. I did change the zoom a bit with each shot, blindly attempting to bracket the shots in hopes of getting at least one crisp, focused, and non-blurred image of the leaves. Sometime later I viewed the pictures on my computer. Only then did I discover that one of the images had a blue orb in it. I did not notice the object while taking the pictures.  I was using the LCD monitor at arms’ length for composition the camera is otherwise a viewfinder that’s difficult to use, especially at low light levels. I haven’t assumed it was a UFO or a “physical” object. But I am no less curious about it, and wonder if I can have the picture analyzed. I thought perhaps it was a refraction within the lens. But, again, this orb appears in just one picture and not the others despite the fact all were shot at the same time under exactly the same conditions. When enlarging the image on my computer there doesn’t seem to be a clear indication that it is the result of refraction. Further, at maximum enlargement, the blue orb seems to have structural depth, though this might be pixel positioning or pixel structure. Considering the potential, however slight, for actual structural depth, coupled with a little imaginative assumption, I thought it might be a disc traveling perpendicular to the ground. The object is round, powder blue, and looks like a ball. It looks much like a planet might look if observed through a powerful telescope. I was shooting more or less straight up and overhead while facing roughly ESE. I haven’t altered or otherwise fiddled with this image. You’ll notice that there are “holes” in the image, areas where my camera media-card is losing pixels. I was tempted to “fix” these, but decided against it to preserve the image “exactly as it was taken”. I am e-mailing the picture to you too. Not knowing your parameters I’ll send two copies, one at the original size and the other reduced to “e-mail sizing”. Thank you;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908
White spherical object standing still in the sky.;2009-10-24 17:24:00;1Min 54Sec.;White spherical object standing still in the sky. At around 5:24pm on Saturday, October 24th I was outside taking pictures of the natural landscape as I am prone to do when I spotted a white round object sitting still in the sky at about 90 degrees from the horizon.  The object remained steady at the same spot in the sky and I quickly started taking pictures of it.  I was also able to yell towards the house and both my wife and my daughter ran out and also were able to observe the object while I continued to take more pictures.  Throughout this whole process the object did not move from the location that it was first observed in the sky. I was able to take 26 pictures in RAW and 26 in JPEG before a group of clouds moved in and obscured the object from sight.  Eventually the clouds moved away, however the object was no longer visible in the sky once visibility was clear again.  Strangely enough the object was very similar in appearance to the previous object that I captured on October 11th of this year (as reported to the ufo center previously) except that this time it was not moving.

Electrical Sphere shape morning sky over Palm Beach Florida;2010-10-11 06:20:00;40 min;Electrical Sphere shape morning sky over Palm Beach Florida I saw a UFO this morning at 6:20 till around 6:40 in the SW sky.  It remained staionary for the duration. I used my binoculars and could cleary see a round electrical field changing colors of red greens blues etc..  It disappeared from view at the sun rise.  I have no idea what it was but definately nothing I have seen before.  This event was witnesed by my Aunt as well.;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908
Bright pulsating Orange/Red light vanishing and re-appearing for a few minutes.;2012-04-22 21:00:00;~5-10 minutes;Bright pulsating Orange/Red light vanishing and re-appearing for a few minutes. On the night of April 22nd, 2012, around 9:00pm, I was looking at the moon with binoculars, and noticed a bright red/orange flashing/flickering/pulsing light. It was much brighter and larger than other stars, so I figured it was a plane or something like that. But I can recognize a plane's green and red blinkers, and it's steady movement this was not a plane. The color was distinctively bright dark red, and bright orange (it would seem to alternate between the two, but definitely red and orange could be discerned clearly). I looked at it for a few minutes, then realized it was actually moving slightly, and would temporarily completely vanish for a moment, only to reappear at a slightly different location. This process of 'pulsing' red/orange and 'vanishing' to re-appear close by continued for a few minutes. The very last time it vanished, I could've sworn i saw it 'release' some sort of a trail, similar to a meteor tail, but it was a red-streak, and bent slightly. I was simply amazed at what I had just seen, so I kept looking at the sky, but eventually clouds moved in, and the object never re-appeared. I went online to do some research the next day, and sure enough, one lady in the area has caught it on film and uploaded to youtube. (unfortunately, the video is of poor quality and hardly shows a faint but bright red light flickering slightly before disappearing)  I've contacted this person, and I found out that she was looking in the same direction, at the same time I was. My brother claims to have seen the light return the next day, although I wasn't in the area at the time, so I can't confirm this. Interestingly enough, both Texas and Georgia also reported bright orange/red lights around 9:00pm on that same night. I am under the impression that this object may have been the very same, headed for the Gulf, giving each state a different point of view.;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908
At dusk 2 pulsating spheres started slowly moving towards us;2013-02-13 20:00:00;3-5 minutes;At dusk 2 pulsating spheres started slowly moving towards us Well it was about 8:00 and it just started getting dark. Two friends and I were walking around talking in another friend's big open drive way when we saw two UFOs hovering a few hundred feet over the trees in the distance.  The UFOs ascended behind the trees and then only moved horizontal after that.  They both were sphere shaped, pulsating bright lights, and changed colors between orange, red, yellow, and white.  They were almost hard to look at because of how bright they were and they kept getting closer.  Neither of them made a sound even as they started getting closer and closer. They got so close they  were in the neighbors yard and then not that far from being directly over us so we darted inside fast. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

Orange glowing orb releasing blue smoke in all directions .;2013-08-07 20:00:00;5 minutes;Orange glowing orb releasing blue smoke in all directions . To start out I live near the west palm beach airport.  Airplanes fly over our street probably 50 times a day and are generally pretty low to the ground before the gain altitude. Last evening I sat outside with my husband and neighbor while the sun was almost all the way set.  There was no particularly beautiful or colorful sunset.  In fact the clouds looked more of a muddy grey.  A plane took off and was probably right above the inlet when we noticed a bright orange, spherical orb glowing probably 20 ft. From the aircraft. At first glance we thought it was another plane, but logic kicked in and I quickly realized that there was no way two planes could fly so close to each other especially at such a low elevation.  We watched for a few seconds longer and the orb seemed to keep pace with the plane.  Then suddenly it begin to expand and the color turned it to a bright white blue color, and smoke spewed from all directions.  At this point the plane had gai! ned elevation and began to Veer off north over the Atlantic.  The small ord continued on its path at a low elevation until it disaperaed from our view.  Another odd thing is it left a NEON blue colored cloud hanging in the darkened  Sky.   We watched in amazement until it evaporated completely and snap a few photos of the cloud it left behind. As soon as I went inside I hopped online a search for simular discriptions and the closest explanation I could find was Ball Lightning  almost everything matches up except for the fact that there was no stormy weather and it did not fall out of the sky.  And it also leaves me questioning the mysterious glowing blue cloud it left behind.;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908
Orange glowing orb seen by 2 people.;2013-09-03 19:30:00;4 minutes;Orange glowing orb seen by 2 people A glowing orange orb that ascended while coming towards us then turned west and disappeared.  The orb appeared to be about the size of a basketball maybe bigger. It was still light out and was noticed due to it glowing.  It was a steady orange glow.;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908
