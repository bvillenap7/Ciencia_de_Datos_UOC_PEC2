Grey visitation and abduction.;2000-01-19 03:00:00;20 minutes;Grey visitation and abduction. I was awaken by the sound of booming thunder on the morning of January 19 , 2000 and as I looked at the clock on my bed stand ( it said 3:00am ), I saw GREY ALIENS approach from the foot of my bed and stare into my eyes , paralyzing me . I couldn't move my body but I could move my eyes and I shut them and said over and over in my head You're not here...you're not here  .  But when I opened my eyes they were there , moving closer to my face .  It seemed as though there were about 5 or 6 of them . It was the typical GREY description , being 3-4 feet tall , big heads and large black eyes . I shut my eyes again and then I had a sensation of flipping over and over , head to foot . Suddenly I heard what sounded like thunder again and I was awake in my bed , the clock said it was 3:20 am . I still cannot recall just exactly what happened but 20 minutes passed and it seemed as only a few had . I had no memory recall of being on or in a craft .;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908
