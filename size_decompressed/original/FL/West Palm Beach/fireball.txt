Two fireballs, western palm beach county Hwy. 710.  ((anonymous report));1990-11-01 17:00:00;00:05;two fireballs, western palm beach county Hwy. 710 Around 1990, driving NW on state hwy 710 near 5pm i saw 2 fireballs the size of a small, VW Bug vehicle floating downward over the highway right-of-way fence line (approx. 200 yds.) southwest of my position. As i drove by, both floated down slowly (one higher than the other, by only feet apart).  I slowed my vehicle and watched as they both disappeared behind the fence line brush, but they did not ignite the brush. Both round ball objects glowed orange and red as if on fire and traveled slower than gravity speed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Fireball explodes in West Palm Beach night sky;2008-03-15 02:15:00;30 seconds;Fireball explodes in West Palm Beach night sky At first it resembled an airplane, (a red dot in a black, cloudless sky), but it moved from the north to the southeast very quickly, and became more red and brilliant as it approached.  After about 25 seconds, it looked as though it had a flame behind it, and then suddenly exploded like a puff of red smoke or a tiny firework.  There was no residual smoke - only a bright flash and outward poof - and then nothing at all. At one point it looked as though it was heading right for us. I would say it was about two to three miles away when it exploded. There was no sound. Freaked us all out.;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908
