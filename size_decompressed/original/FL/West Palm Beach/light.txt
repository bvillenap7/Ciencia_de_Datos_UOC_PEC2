Object was stationary for 3-4 minutes. I was on 441 heading to work early in the morning, when I noticed a very bright plane in the sky, I watched it for a while not thinking much about it and noticed that it hadn’t moved. So I stayed watching it for about 20 seconds ( which was hard because I was driving) but I managed to keep an eye on it when I noticed it started to dim away, Almost completely, then came back into view but this time it was red....which really caught my attention so I started trying to video tape but obviously driving and video taping something in the sky is a lot easier said than done. Anyways as I start getting closer to where this thing is In the sky (I was driving In a straight line for about 3-4 minutes) it goes back to its original form and starts to blink every couple of seconds...at this point I was freaking out and had just pulled up to a red light, but of course once I did it was gone. Completely.  If I wasn’t heading to work I would have stayed In the area to see if ! I could spot what ever it was again. The weirdest part about all of this is that me and two other people saw something very similar to this about six months ago over the same road and basically same location I’m not sure what it could be I thought about a lot of different possibilities perhaps someone in the area has a really expensive drone but it would have to be gigantic the size of a plane....I can give you guys the roads that I saw it hovering above but I don’t know much about longitude and latitude location;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908
