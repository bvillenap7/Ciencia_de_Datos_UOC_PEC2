I thought I would tell you about the one I saw with my son.  My son and I had just left our home to go get gas in the car for a trip that we were going on the next day. as we were driving something caught my eye in the sky.  I looked up and saw a silver glow in the sky.  It was  shaped like a butane tank but maybe the size of three traincars.  It was just over the tree line. I slowed down and pulled over. and then like a shot it went stright up and turn to the west and was gone.  I looked over at my son and asked if he had seen that. He said woo mom what was that thing.  He was 18 at the time.  I am a nurse and my husband at the time worked for nasa.  so when we got back home I asked him if there were any test or flights that he new of for that night. He said no but after telling him what we had seen, he made a call to nasa to see. Thay also said no none at all. We nevrer knew what it was but I sill keep looking at the sky.
