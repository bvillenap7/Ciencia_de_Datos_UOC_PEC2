Came outside to smoke looked up and saw a obect moving from what appears to be south to north accross the sky. The object flared to a bright light exploding and burning up with suped bright light. The object then left a smoke trail and two distict smoke clouds. Moments late a large black prop engine plane much lower in the sky flew past and turn west ward just after passing the smoke cloud area. The closest thing I can relate to it was when the recent shuttle break up occured over texas. It was super bright but only left a small trail of smoke.;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908
high speed cloud shape changing direction;2007-12-21 17:20:00;10 minutes;high speed cloud shape changing direction Report from West Palm Beach , Florida. Sighting  December 21,2007 17:20hrs. Cloud like object.  I am a  60 year old business owner in WPB,FL. I was a Sgt. in USMC Air Corp.and know aircraft/atmospheric/astronomical events.I've seen aircraft on fire in the air, flare drops, rockets launch,blimps,meteors,comets, space debris ect.both day and night. My wife and I were driving home heading due west when I saw at our 12 oclock what appeared to be a small ,flattened oval shape, bright cloud about 50 degrees above the western horizon ,the sky was otherwise totally cloudless and blue, visibility unlimited. My second assessment was an aircraft and contrail at high altitude,  yet the shape just wasn't right.It was larger, brighter and more rounded at the front trailing to the rear but overall very short and unchanging in length or appearance. We were about 3 miles due west of Palm Beach International and a 737 which was climbing out on take off was of equal size .Meaning the cloud/object size was visually equal to the wingspan of the low flying 737, perhaps 3 inchs at arms length. The object was moving S and after 5 minutes was at our 8 oclock and dropping to 20 degrees above the horizon as we drove due west. I then watched the object move to the west of it trajectory as we were stopped at a long traffic light. I say move instead of turn because the object changed course to the west 20 degrees of view within 30 seconds but did not change shape, no curve to contrail,no change of aspect, just change of direction and location .It then dropped slowly below the horizon.to the SW. I judged its westerly turn as its view was briefly obscured by several concrete light poles at the intersection . We were stopped , watching through the drivers side window, the object began traversing from our left to right. First visible to the left of the poles then crossing behind and visable on their rightside. If it had not changed direction it would have simply settled below the horizon maintaining it movement to our left. Also the cloud appearance never changed, like a still photo of it moving accross the sky.Very strange event.;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908

Then, saw a bright orange tinted orbe in the sky at a 90 degree angle for about a second and a half downward toward earth, it left a perfect straight line of what looked like fire in the sky. I do not belive this was a space craft from another star but i would like to know what i saw and if you have any information on what happened on this night i would love to know. thank you.

Unidentified, low-frequency, pulsing noise - could not locate a source.;2016-05-10 01:00:00;<30 minutes;Unidentified, low-frequency, pulsing noise - could not locate a source. At approximately 01:00, on the night of May 10, 2016, I was woken to a very low frequency humming/pulsing noise. I got up, went to the window, nothing.  So I ran to my balcony for a better view of the sky. The only thing I can say about what I witnessed was that the night sky was red, BRIGHT night - the brightest I have ever seen.  The moon was only about half full at this point, but I could not identify a noise source and noticed the pulsing almost seemed to move across me - as of it was something tangible.  Seemed to be eminating from south of my location. This noise was almost intoxicating - I did not want to move.  I walked inside and about thirty minutes had past, but where the time went I do not know.  It felt like less than five minutes from when I woke up to coming back inside, but that was not the case. Upon entering my house my dog (she is a hearty boxer) started backing up very slowly and began a low growl.  I walked up to her and as soon as I touched her she was herself again.  I also have three cats that would not come out of my bedroom until days later. I woke up the next morning with what appeared to be one long hive stretching from my mid thigh all the way up to the back of my ribcage (right side) - I have never had 'hives' before, but I brushed it off - initially.  It has been almost a complete seven days since and the one big hive has not budged - not even itchy.  I can run my hands along it without even realizing I am doing so.  This is the most frightening experience out of the whole sha-bang. No craft was visible to me and I have not heard the pulsing noise since that night. I did bring my phone outside with me and thought I hit 'record' bc I remember hitting the 'stop' button upon entering my house again, but no video was recorded - no sight, no sound, and no time stamps. Ever since hearing this I have been on a mission to find others who might've heard this, as well.  My parents' live about two miles north of me and I asked them both if they had seen or heard anything odd that Tuesday night.  Both said no though my father did state the sky looked different that night than any other.  My father has been sailing the world for over forty years so for him to state this...  It means a lot to me. If anyone else in south Fl heard this, please make yourselves known. Thank you.;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908
