I've seen the black teardrop/sphere/baloon too....;2005-10-01 18:00:00;1 min;I've seen the black teardrop/sphere/baloon too.... Ok not sure of the date but the time is close enough, I was reading some of the current reports and had to report what I had seen due to the reports I have just read. I too have witnessed the black teardrop or sphere shaped object. At first I too thought it was a black baloon and watched it for a few seconds but then it occured to me it was moving in a perfect straight line (PERFECT) no sound at all and very smooth, I was looking west and the sun was still up , the object was moving from the south heading north. I watched this thing until it got to far away and out of sight but I knew that it wasn't a baloon after I watched it longer, I am an ameture astronomer and am always looking up. I have never seen anything like it. Sure wish I had a pair of binoculars at the time I would like to know what it was or at least get a closer look because at first I dismissed as a baloon and that is when it was closest to me......
