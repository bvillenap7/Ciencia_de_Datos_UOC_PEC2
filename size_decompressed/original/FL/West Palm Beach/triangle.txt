Triangle UFO sighting;1998-12-20 20:30:00;10 seconds;Triangle UFO sighting When I was about 13 years old, I was riding in the passenger seat of my mother's car and looking out the window. It was night time, probably around 8pm, and I saw a triangular object hovering in the sky. I remember there being 3 red lights, one at each point of the triangle, and it may have had a light in the center but I cannot remember. It was hovering in the sky, barely moving, and it must have been relatively low because it appeared fairly large. Then about 8 seconds after I spotted the object, it shot off into the sky with a flash of light and disappeared. It made a sort of zig-zag maneuver, in the shape of an S or a Z, as it flew away.  It was moving so quickly that it was gone within a second and all I could see was a faint light trail.  I have always been a skeptic so I immediately began scanning the area for any kind of tower or aircraft that could explain what I saw but there was nothing in the area. This sighting was over 10 years ago and I beli! eve it was around Christmas time but I can't remember the actual date. I am 25 years old and a member of the US Armed Forces. I consider myself a very rational person but I cannot explain what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908

Seemed like a fire ball entering the earths atmosphere but it was moving too slow. On the way down it looked as though it was one fire ball. Craft then stopped and turned up which is when it seemed like a triangle with one light or fire ball on top and two at the bottom as they would appear on a plane. The craft then hovered for a moment then the bottom two lights shot out to the left and right very quickly and dissapeared in the clouds. The top light just shot very quickly straight up and dissapeared.  I was driving north on Flagler road in west palm beach and there were at least ten vehicles pulled over and stopped to watch. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch at 2055 hrs (EDT).  We wonder whether the witness recorded the time correctly.  PD));26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908

A friend and myself were sitting in her back yard and I was starring off into the night sky & stars.  Before i know it i see a blue & purple anomaly in the sky at warp speed.  I screamed to my friend, trying to point it out to her.  She missed it.  I was convinced what i saw was OUT OF THIS WORLD & Nothing i have EVER seen in my life. it moved at speed a plane could not have.  THEN, About 3 to 5 minutes after seeing that first one, my friend yelled my name and said look!!  look in the sky!!  What i saw was something that was wayyyyyy closer then the one i saw before, and did not have the same colorful lightings as the other. BUT was JUST as strange.  It was a upside down V in the sky with what looked to be circles underneath the object on the lines of upside down V. It seemed so near to us, it also seemed to be moving slow motion at first, almost hovering now that i think about. Then before i knew it, it was gone,! at a speed UNRECOGNIZABLE. I also MUST add that this upside down V was SILENT, it made absolutley no sound. I also must say this, i saw what seemed to be sometime other man made plane in the sky around where i seen these two UFO's. Which i do belive were some goverment planes either keeping a eye or studying these objects. They know what and when something is in the sky. The goverment plane theory is just the conspiracist side of me coming out, but i wouldn't doubt it for a second. BUT I KNOW WHAT I SAW IN THE SKY THAT NIGHT. This is my story. I hope this information will help some how. I'll never forget it.  Thank you.;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908
Brown triangle ufo WPB fl;2012-02-10 12:00:00;2 minutes;Brown triangle ufo WPB fl I was taking pictures of the vegetable garden and noticed weird clouds and an arrow cloud.  I took 5 photos of the clouds.   The next day while looking at the pictures on my computer I noticed a spot on one of the photographs and zoomed on it and saw a brown triangle ufo.   While I was taking the pictures there were no helicopters, planes or birds in the sky so I don’t know what that was but I didn’t see it with my naked eye, only later on my computer. 2/10/12.;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908
3 red lights in a triangle patter and slowly disappearing, seen by one firefighter and 4 civilians;2012-09-21 20:30:00;3-5 minutes;3 red lights in a triangle patter and slowly disappearing, seen by one firefighter and 4 civilians On the night of 09/21/12 at around 20:30 hours, I, Edgar A. Valbuena saw 3 lights in the ski as I was traveling south in Palm Beach county, zip code 33401. The lights had been on the ski for about two minutes before I was able to pull over into a gas station where 4 civilians were looking at the ski too. The direction of travel was south-west near the Palm Beach International airport. The speed was extremely slow. The lights formed a triangle and the light in the front started to slowly disappear at around 20:29 hours. At 20:30 and 20:31 I was able to take a picture of the remaining two. The two remaining lights also started to disappear starting with the one that appears in the lower section of the pictures that I will submit via email. The weather conditions were cloudy skies, no rain, 79 degrees Fahrenheit and low to none wind speed. At 2040 I was able to contact the phone # (206) 722-3000 and notified the gentleman about the incident.;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908
At approx. 20:30 hrs EST I watched a comm. aircraft transition (witnessed standard aircraft lights) from N to S just E of Fl coast.;2013-08-07 20:33:00;3 minutes;At approx. 20:30 hrs EST I watched a commercial aircraft transition (witnessed standard aircraft lights) from north to south just east of the Florida coast, at what appeared to be approx. 7,000 feet.  I was curious about that aircraft for two reasons 1.  I am a private pilot and generally enjoy seeing aircraft flying over and 2. I had watched my daughter and son-in-law arrive along the same track two nights ago while they were returning on a flight from Philadelphia to Miami (I had been watching their progress via the internet flight tracking software.  I looked up a couple of minutes after that aircraft passed to the south and saw another light in the sky at about the same altitude and location.  This light was white in color and looked like a landing light.  It almost looked like a satellite but without the speed one would normally see.   Within a couple of seconds I noticed a green light behind the white light (to the left of the light, or North).  A seco! nd later there was a sudden bright intensity that looked like a rocket separating from its booster, a bright center with the shape of a brilliant triangle with the original light at the tip pointing out towards the east.  The light shape lasted only a couple of seconds and then disappeared.  I lost sight of the light for a second or two and when I next located the same position in the sky there appeared to be two green lights separated by about ¼” at arms length.  The green lights remained separated by a fixed distance while the lights appeared to move towards the east.  Living in Florida for the past 40 years I’ve seen my share of rocket launches, this was in the wrong location for a rocket coming out of Cape Canaveral.  The shape and color of the contrail looked just like a rocket separation.  My best guess was a missile that was dropped from a launch plane, engine ignited and flamed out after a few seconds.  Very strange. I am a private pilot and retired Deputy fire chief.  I am an avid aviation enthusiast and monitor launch schedules from the Cape and satellite sighting via iPhone software.  This was the most unusual sighting I have seen, mostly because of the location being so close to West Palm Beach and the commercial airways to and from Ft. Lauderdale and Miami ((NUFORC Note:  A launch of a Delta IV rocket from Cape Canaveral occurred at 20:29 hrs. on this date.  PD));26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908

Hi. Tonight I witnessed 2 orange &quotpyramid&quot shaped UFO's moving at approx. 100 to 150 mph over the Palm Beach International ai;2018-06-03 22:30:00;7 minutes;Hi. Tonight I witnessed 2 orange &quotpyramid&quot shaped UFO's moving at approx. 100 to 150 mph over the Palm Beach International ai Hi. Tonight I witnessed 2 orange pyramid shaped UFO's moving at approx. 100 to 150 mph over the Palm Beach International airport area.  They were separated by about 1 mile and a half and seemed to be about 30 feet wide front to back and side to side.  They were making no sound and were not fighter jets using afterburners.  I was in  the U.S. military and was in areas to watch fighters in training at bases overseas and they were not fighters.  They appeared to resemble a pyramid shape pointing into the sky as they were flying.  they were moving in a north north east direction.  I saw no beams being used.  As I went down the road to see where they were going they disappeared over the airport without landing at the airport.  The craft actually were flying directly over president Trumps Golf Course here in Palm Beach and I have seen these same types of crafts with different shapes flying over the same area before.  About 4 years ago I saw seven crafts flying ! in a circular pattern over the same golf course moving slower at about 70 or 80 mph.  Those craft disappeared into a large cloud bank after circling the area for about 40 minutes.  In total I have seen about 15 small lighted or orange type unidentified craft flying over or around this area before.  This is no joke and is real.  I'm sitting right under where I saw them tonight writing this to you and only feet from the Palm Beach airport;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908
