Then at 7:30 when I help take out the restuarant trash , I notices 3 objects moving flying in perfect straight formation, (they didn't look like a plane or any normal aircraft). Then I went inside to get trash bags for the cans, my coworker said he saw two planes flying together chasing the 3 objects the 1950ish type planes split up (east to west) , the one plane heading east towards the 2nd ufo in formation zoomed over me and my coworkers head , the planes were flying low. Then all of the sudden the middle ufo stop (like it had breaks) no plane I know can do this the other two ufos moved closer to the middle ufo. Then I went inside quick because I had to go back to work. There were 3 objects flying in formation moving due south following the beach at 7:30 . Two planes flying after the 3 objects separated east to west. One of the pilots flying late model war planes flew low over us. The objects were bright like moving stars. In no-way looked like a plane. The 3 objects had get breaking ability, also the ability to fly in perfect formation like a perfect line. Also it was a clear night so many others may have witnessed what I saw.;26.7047117455139;-80.1012420880908
