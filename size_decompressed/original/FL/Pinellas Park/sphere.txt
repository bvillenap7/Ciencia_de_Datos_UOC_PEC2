I turned just in time to see a bright round object descending at a steep angle from North to South across the western sky. It appeared to be very large and changed colors from purple to green to red to yellow and finally to white as it disappeared behind the trees. We live a short distance from the coast, and from my estimation it landed/crashed into the Gulf of Mexico somewhere West of the Tampa Bay area. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION)) Yes, it was Friday morning at 5:45am, I had noticed how big Venus appeared to be, and had called my wife outside to show her. (She was getting ready for work) and she happened to look West and yelled for me to look. ((END));27.8657786729857;-82.7101142180095

As I looked up in the sky watching the fireworks.  I noticed a glowing orange red orb around 70 to 90 feet above my head.  There was no sound and moving at a slow pace.  Once that past by my head I noticed a second orb moving in the same direction from the north to the south.;27.8657786729857;-82.7101142180095
