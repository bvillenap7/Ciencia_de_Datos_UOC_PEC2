yellow/ gold dsah of light following a rounded object;2020-05-02 22:15:00;Seconds;yellow/ gold dsah of light following a rounded object On May 2, 2020 around 22:15 I was standing outside and while looking up I saw what appeared to be a dash of yellow/gold light with a rounded shape in front of it, the visual lasted maybe 3 seconds, but I definitely saw it and it threw me off.  After seeing it my eyes became watery and it freaked me out.  About 10- 15 minutes later I was driving on the road I saw the light and I saw something white float from the ground up.  After viewing this my eyes again became watery and all other lights started messing with my eyes, especially a certain star.;27.8657786729857;-82.7101142180095
