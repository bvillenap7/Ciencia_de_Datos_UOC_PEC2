Invisible craft hovered, disturbing bushes and grass, annd then left.;2005-02-01 03:10:00;15 seconds;Invisible craft hovered, disturbing bushes and grass, annd then left. This is really hard to explain.  I was actually on an alarm call (I am a police officer) in a large industrial area.  I heard what sounded like the noise (wind, exhaust, but not an engine) of an aircraft.  Not alarmed at first because there is an airport a couple of miles away.  But I turned around to see that the noise was right over me, and though I could not see a ship or craft I could tell that something was distorting the view of the sky.  Kind of like a cloaking or camoflauge of some type.  I also observed it to hover low, less than 100 ft, and appear (based on the noise and movement of the grass and bushes) to circle the building I was at.   This building was an abandoned telephone office complex that is close to a Lockheed Martin facility.  As far as I know, this place only builds aircraft metal parts such as cowlings for the B52 bomber and other pieces.  The adress of the building I was at is 1222 MCI Drive, the old MCI building that has been vacant for several years.   I don't know what else to say, other than you could not see the object, but I KNEW it was flying and hovering and could tell when it departed.  It went due south and out of the area.   When I went back to my police cruiser, the engine was dead.  I always leave it running, as it was chilly on this night.  I also had to restart my MDC (Mobile Data Computer) as it had shut down.  It would not work the rest of the shift and had to be turned in for repairs.  I have not heard what was wrong with it, but I DID NOT tell anyone about the incident.;27.8657786729857;-82.7101142180095
