A BRIGHT blue, red, green, white globe that would go out and randomly change colors. ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star?  PD));2010-10-12 22:15:00;about 30 minutes;A BRIGHT blue, red, green, white globe that would go out and randomly change colors. I was on my way to walmart with my boyfriend when all of a sudden he point of this weird light to out right (west). He told me to turn in and park and we would start recording it.  After we parked we got out of the car and it disappeared. 2 minutes top went by and we caught this glowing globe to our far right (east). We thought it moved that fast? weird right?  I got out my camera and started recording. It was a glowing globe with no pattern in the changing of colors. it would be a BRIGHT blue and then BRIGHT red and go out and then white and out and green and red and out and blue.  We noticed it standing still and went into the store. Coming out of the store about 20 minutes later, the glowing globe was still there and was still changing colors. We know it wasn't a plane. We've both seen planes, we actually saw 2 planes while watching the bright globe change colors. ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star?  PD));27.8657786729857;-82.7101142180095

My wife was outside watching the neighbor's fireworks,she turned to watch two redish orange lights moving slowly in the sky she yelled for me to look and at 21:20 we both watched the lights make a slow 45 degree turn and quickly disappear into the clouds. The size of the two lights were the size of a bright star at night.The sky was cloudy and there was rain in the area. We do get air traffic over our home,but,we have never seen anything like this.
