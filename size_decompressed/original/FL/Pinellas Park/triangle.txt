I took my sun glasses off because I assumed it was a trick of the sunlight on my shades.  I removed my glasses and stared at this unidentified floating object, intrigued the entire time it was visible.   The whole 3 to five minutes I stared at this craft it did not move. I was so curious about what I was seeing I couldn't blink or look away,  I moved around to view the object from several angles.  As I inspected the object and began walking towards where it was floating, it quickly vanished into thin air. It was a perfect blue sky that day 90 degree Florida weather.   I looked all around as I walked up to the location where I saw the craft hovering.  I would write it off as a reflection but I could see a thin gray object on top of this crystal clear object.  Also the area I saw it had no water sources and was filled with grass and pine trees.  I asked another woman who was walking behind me if she had seen the object.  She did witness the object I saw but didn't see the grey roof on the craft, she had only seen the crystal triangular shape hovering over the same area.  I have had other strange encounters that puzzle me.  These things happened to me years ago and I still try to make sense of it today.  Some nights I can't sleep due to gaps of missing time from at night.   I am a not crazy bum, I own a business, I have a degree,   I volunteer for charity and I have to tell you that there are things out there you just can't explain.;27.8657786729857;-82.7101142180095
