Many orange and red lights traveling in formation.;2013-12-31 23:40:00;15 minutes;Many orange and red lights traveling in formation While watching the fireworks from my yard I noticed several lights moving toward my area from the east.  I went inside to get my camera when I came back outside there were more lights.  They seemed to travel in two's and three's.   The weather was a slight breeze from the west and a slow drizzly rain.   They seemed to remain in formation until they disappeared into the clouds.  When they first came from the east they were white then changed to orange and then red and then disappeared.   My wife first thought they were planes but, there were no other lights.  There were no sounds at all.  One time there were six lights they looked like they were in a formation of a triangle.  The speed was like a jetliner coming in for a landing at an airport not fast and not slow either. There was no erratic movement of any kind very smooth moving.   We watched for 15 minutes until they stopped coming. I took several pictures but I couldn't keep the camera still.  There were twenty to twenty five lights in all.  I have never seen anything like  that.  We thought they might be floating lanterns but the wind was going in the opposite direction.;27.8657786729857;-82.7101142180095
