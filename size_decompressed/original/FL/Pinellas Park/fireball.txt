Appeared from SE sky a bit too far south to be from NASA launches I have seen in the past.  Traveled almost straight up for several seconds and then turned sharply, but not too quickly toward the NNW.  Gained in altitude until it faded from sight.;27.8657786729857;-82.7101142180095

Glowing fireballs seen over Pinellas Park, FL.  ((Spacelink satellites??);2020-01-01 00:17:00;5 minutes;Glowing fireballs seen over Pinellas Park, FL Sighting of 2 fireball type objects within a minute or so of each other.  Traveling from the west to east.  The flying pattern of the object was not of any conventional aircraft.  The fireball seemed to consist of 3 individual fireballs or lights.  To the naked eye, they appeared white, but the video taken shows them as almost orange in color.  They moved horizontally but would randomly drop down in the sky and would eventually slowly disappear into thin air.   Then, shortly after one disappeared from sight, another would appear in the same location as the first and take the same path from west to east, as the previous one.   Sighting was made by two individuals, husband and wife, in their mid-50's, of sound mind and body.  I will be posting an additional report regarding the same type of sighting that happened in the same exact location exactly one year to the day, and almost to the minute prior.;27.8657786729857;-82.7101142180095
