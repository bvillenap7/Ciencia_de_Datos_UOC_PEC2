Orange Glowing Sphere Falls Slowly;2010-02-09 20:05:00;15 seconds;Orange Glowing Sphere Falls Slowly While watching several drones of unknown origin with binoculars I spotted a small spherical object fall slowly to the earth.  I was able to keep in view until it arrived to the tree line just above the horizon.  This “orb” was a luminous orange color.  Somehow it resisted also stayed in a straight line all during it’s descent.  It fell to slowly for it to be a gravity attracted object, therefore never reaching terminal velocity of something free falling.  The entire time it maintained an direct and straight trajectory towards the ground.;29.2221;-81.4351
