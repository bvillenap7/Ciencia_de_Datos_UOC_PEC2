Two diamond shaped lights in the sky pulsating.;2005-07-11 23:45:00;1 minute;Two diamond shaped lights in the sky pulsating. This will sound made up strictly because it happened at least 15 years ago.  I’m watching unsolved mysteries on Netflix and the UFO episode came on and made me want to do some research.  Found this website, so here it goes.  I remember having a small rash on either my right or left arm and it being itchy. S o, I scratched it. Nothing crazy happened but I do remember seeing either 3 or 6 white dots on my arm in the shape of a diamond.  Imagine 3 dots making a triangle shape, then three more making the same shape but flipped at the bottom which kind of make a diamond shape.  Probably a horrible description, I apologize.  So anyway, I have these weird marks on my arm and I honestly don’t remember the date that this happened but but I remember coming home late from my girlfriends house at the time, 11:30pm sticks out in my mind, and as I’m walking up the driveway I realize it’s just a beautiful night out in Florida.  Clear skies, nice weather, so I take a moment while w! alking up the driveway and decide to stare up into the sky, which I never do.  I notice these two triangle shapes in the sky, which form a diamond, same shape that’s on my forearm and I start thinking “man, that’s weird.  That’s so bright.  Way brighter than any star in the sky.”  Perfect bright white circles.  Then they pulsate and I feel my forearm get tense and pulsate as well.  I didn’t stand outside much longer because it freaked me out but I remember looking at the lights and watching them pulsate about 2-3 more times and feeling my arm pulsate and throb simultaneously before getting nervous and going inside.  I remember being freaked out and calling my buddy on the phone.  Never saw the lights again, the marks stayed on my arm for quite awhile, but my arms are covered in tattoos now.  Wish I would have taken some photos of the marks.  Never knew how they got there or why I decided to look up in the sky that night or why my arm pulsated with the lights in the sky either.  Gives me chills and goosebumps just talking about it.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
A red and green diamond shaped spacecraft.;2014-03-04 00:30:00;15 minutes;A red and green diamond shaped spacecraft. Last night I was on the phone.  I immediately jumped as the sound of bees filled my ears, but there was no bees only a red spacecraft with green blinking lights.   I ran inside to get my brother and mom to witness the phenomena appearing right in front of me.  It went up, down, forwards and backwards.   I was baffled but I realized the reason it was looking at our house is because it had the same colors as the ship, red and green.  Maybe they thought it was their spaceship. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she sounded sincere.  PD));27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504

But it was moving at a normal speed so I thought nothing of it and continued to check out the moon.   After about 5 minutes I started hearing a high pitched thunder sound, kind of like a jet fighter ripping through the air, I started to see Triangular/long Diamond shaped UFOs, I counted 8 total, 2 in the North, East, South and West just hovering and making a humming sound, they HAD to be thousands of feet up in the sky bc the Binoculars I have aren’t crappy  My Curiosity got the best of me and I go back out around 3:50Am-4:07Am this time with 2 laser pointers and figure if its really NOT a plane, cause IF it IS a commercial aircraft or silent drone then im in trouble and there will be cops down the street on top of being charged bc that ca! n hurt a pilot.  Shined the lasers in the direction of the UFOs and LITERALLY, one of them shot across the sky like a freaking fireball, that’s seriously when I came in and forget that man I ain’t going out there no more alone at dark.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
