Large triangular craft going east over the Atlantic Ocean.;1980-07-20 13:00:00;~10 minutes;Large triangular craft going east over the Atlantic Ocean. On July 20th, 1980, I was an employee working security at the St. Lucie Nuclear power plant.  At that time they had remote outpost from the plant and not within the confines of the nuclear plant itself.  Afterwards, I became a Florida State Trooper. I was alone, and at approx 1300 hours, I was looking at a clear night sky, looking for falling stars and just gazing at the night sky, it was a very well moonlight type of night. All of a sudden overhead at approx 2,000 feet, I began to see an object coming from the West heading to the east towards the Ocean.  The craft was dark and all I could see at first was a nose cone type shape.  As the object passed directly overhead, I realize the enormous size of this triangular ship with NO sound.  It had to be aircraft carrier size and it was just floating by slowly.  I was in just awe of this thing and scared out of my wits. I could distinctly see port hole type windows on this perfectly triangle craft and I estimate that the thickness of its sides to be maybe 3 stories high.  As it passed I could also see 3 distinct circular huge propulshion systems with no sound and emitting a unbelievable white glow where we would normally see jet engines. I watched this craft go out over the Atlantic Ocean heading East until it disappeared from my sight. By this time I expected the entire plant to be going crazy and the radios going crazy, BUT there was not one single radio transmission or alarm and nothing was said. At the end of my shift, I expected someone to also say something about what I observed, but no one did?  The only person I told this too was my mother and for the past 34 years, I never told anyone else about this incident. At the time I couldn't imagine a flying craft in the shape of a triangle, until I saw the Phoenix Lights.  Until then I thought maybe I was hallucinating or dreaming.  But I think of this incident often and can clearly see it in my memory as if it was yesterday. When I saw what happened in Phoenix, Arizona, it gave me more credence as to what I observed 34 years ago.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
Triangle shaped craft above highway moving slowly North.;2007-06-15 00:45:00;2 minutes;Triangle shaped craft above highway moving slowly North. On June 15, 2007, at around 12:45 AM, my girlfriend and I were driving South on I-95 to West Palm Beach, just South of Port Saint Lucie. I saw two bright white lights close together in the sky in the distance above the highway. There was also a much smaller, faint, flashing light.  As we got closer I noticed it was not moving or moving very slowly. I began to slow down and as we drove under it. I looked up again and I saw three white lights in a triangle shape. I have no estimate how large or how high it was. All I can say is that it was not low to the ground and was high up.  My girlfriend got a better look than I did because I was driving. She rolled down her window and stuck her head out. She said it she could see a clear triangle shaped object flying North with a bright white light on each corner. I say it was moving slowly, but she says it wasn't moving that slow. Still, it was not as fast as a conventional plane. She also says the two lights appeared to join together into single object and formed the triangle. However, I believe that was just an illusion caused by the angle we were diving at it.  We kept looking back as we drove away and it was still there moving away. It did not make any sudden or quick moves when we were watching it.  There was plenty of traffic around and the Florida Turnpike was nearby, so there had to be many witnesses.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
Five Flying Objects Spotted in Port Saint Lucie, Florida, with 4 small craft and one large triangle shaped craft.;2015-01-01 22:20:00;5-7 minutes;Five Flying Objects Spotted in Port Saint Lucie, Florida with 4 small craft and one large triangle shaped craft. At approximately 10:18 p.m I went outside onto my backyard patio to smoke.  I sat in my chair and looked out to see if there were any fireworks because I could hear them going off all around.   Next thing I knew I saw two Orange fireball objects coming over some tall trees.  At first I thought they were fireworks and then some kind of rockets until they curved to the left.  I wondered if they were some kind of helicopters but I listened but there wasn't any sound at all.  They were moving very slowly.   I then yelled out to my daughter who was right inside Come here.  Hurry, you have to see this!   My daughter came running and she saw the objects.  Next thing we know there were three lights behind it.  I said whatever it is, they are flying in a triangular formation.   Then two more orange objects came over the trees one at a time.  By this time we were out in the backyard looking up.  It was very cloudy almost a fog outside!   The objects didn't fly in a straight line, but curved several times so we got to see them at different angles.  Still no sound!   As they flee to the closest point to us we could see the large triangle object was a solid object with lights a each point of the triangle.   We watched until the lights disappeared into clouds.  The objects were flying low end o ugh that there should have been some sound but there wasn't.  There had to have been other witnesses because with it being New Years Eve a lot of people were out and about in the area.  In addition my daughter tried to film the objects on her cell phone but she said the screen was black and she was unable to film it.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504

Unidentified craft circling my neighborhood.;2016-08-16 23:00:00;30;Unidentified craft circling my neighborhood. Very low flying craft approx 20 ft wide with a bright light on the end of the two wings.  Looked like a triangle with the point being at the rear.  Circled in a wide circle over my house and court 5 times.  Sounded like a small moped.   It flew by very low and fast from the left and circled the court and then down the street and we could still hear it then approx 10 mins later it passed again a little more over the house and down the court, approx 10-15 mins later it passed again but on the other side of the house.   The next circle was over the house again but a little slower.  The next time was only a couple minutes later, and it was a couple houses down, the final time it passed at the end of the street, 4 houses down.   We could still hear it but didn't see it again.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
Unknown Triangle Craft (?).  ((anonymous report));2017-03-09 20:00:00;7 minutes;Unknown Triangle Craft (?) November 2016 - March 9th, 2017.  I had moved in with my mother last year, around November, and each night I'd stargaze, it was a family thing. Many nights passed and I always noticed a strange star in the sky that was a triangle shape with what looked like a faded upside triangle, but almost see through at the bottom. Sometimes it would glow a bright yellow-ish white, other times it would be dimmed or would quickly dim and look like an aircraft blinking green and red at the ends. At first, I ignored it. The only one that saw it was my boyfriend (at the time.)  It would stay perfectly in place for up to 20 minutes or even an hour before it would begin to move, very slowly. You wouldn't be able to tell unless you had a tree or electric line to measure and keep up with it's movements. Then, it'd either drop down, close to the ground above from where it was or it'd go black and disappear, just to reappear in a different location. We moved, but there it was. I was relieved when my parents told me that they saw it right above them. They said they tried to record it but their phones would mess up or it'd start blinking like a normal airplane, then disappear. They described it as blinking green on one end and the other red. Every night, we go outside to enjoy the night and every night we see it move. Lately, we've seen more and even yesterday (March 9th, 2017), my younger sister and I were picking up my mother from work and we saw it above us a few up in the air before, once again, disappearing. The most frustrating part is how all our phones (a house of five, with multiple phones and tablets), act up when it's around. We've also managed to see it change shapes. Sometimes we can see a darker object inside the bright light (three witnesses). ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.
