Red Orb type ball crashing or descending;2003-07-04 22:15:00;1 minute;Red Orb type ball crashing or descending On the night of July 4th 2003, as our city fireworks display had just completed for about ten minutes,my stepson,wife and myself watched for approximately on minute a red glowing ball moving at an estimated speed of about 400-500 mph approching from about 5 miles or more directly to the south of our location, moving in a 5 to 10 degree decline, starting from 4000 to 5000 feet at first notice, finishing at 400 to 500 feet high,in a straight northerly direction,no more than 1/4 mile away and in direct lineup with Us highway #1. As this ball passed, it displayed a dimming and brightening quality,somewhat like a slow pulsing, and also had a slightly visible vapor trail following behind it, just as normally seen on the edges of fast moving jets. My stepson started to become concerned as i was about to explain to myself and him that it was most likely a falling star, and not a firework, as I have never seen a firework to originate from above and fall down at such kind of a trajectory.Although it did seem at first to look much like a fireball falling in from space, we never heard any noise whatsoever, and just before it passed to our north and continued descending below the visible line of our site,a smaller red ball suddenly, and very quickly,seemed to fly straight down,at no angle whatsoever from the larger ball and disappeared to the east and upwards within seconds.At this point physical laws and simple logical thought has to completely dismiss the possibility of any firework or falling star possibility.  I feel the real possibility that we have witnessed a disabled craft of some sort just before crashing, and never have seen any report to that effect, although many had to witness this event as it was on a very busy night of people outside during this event, and over top of a very busy highway.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504

The long flames were about two inches long and move about 1 ft across the sky before they went out.the front dot was almost connected to the flames for about 10 seconds before drifting away from the 2 flames. It stayed lit for aprox 1/2 minute longer before going out.I watched the event for aprox 3 minutes but did not see it start.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504

Reddish Orange Fireball coming from East  turns N. over E. Coast FL heads toward North Star.;2012-07-04 21:30:00;20 seconds;Reddish Orange Fireball coming from East  turns N. over E. Coast FL heads toward North Star. Approximately 21:30 4th of July 2012 I saw a reddish orange ball of light appear out of the east moving west.  No flashing lights - red, green or strobe.  Getting bigger as it came closer. I live 10 miles inland off the east cost of florida known as the Treasure Coast area.  It may have been over the city - Port St. Lucie, Florida when it turned and headed north.  In two seconds it moved toward the North Star getting smaller until it just out of sight.  The whole episode was only about 15 seconds. I knew if I went in to get my camera, I would have missed it. Seen exact same thing happen on the night of Jan. 1, 2012, when fireworks were going off.  It seems that it came in to inspect and then shot out of sight.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
Fiery Colored Silent Agile Ball Of Light.;2013-08-29 21:15:00;20 minutes;Fiery Colored Silent Agile Ball Of Light. At 9:15 PM, we came on to our back patio which faces West.  We saw what looked like a planet or a star at tree line level.  Very bright.  Golden Orange in color.   We found this strange as we are not used to seeing anything like that so low in the sky.  We sat and looked at it for about 5 minutes.  As it was so still, my Husband took out his iPhone Planet/Star  Finder and nothing was indicated in that area.  At this time the object began to move slightly up, down, left and right in the same area.  It was silent.  Glowing brightly, but not casting light beyond itself.  No blinking or pulsing lights.  It did this for about 5 minutes before heading below the tree line briefly and then up and out to the N-NW at a rapid speed.  As it was traveling, it kept its sawtooth like pattern.  We watched it until it was out of our sight.  We have never seen anything like it.  About a half hour later, there were multiple aircraft in the vicinity.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
Fiery Colored Silent Agile Ball Of Light.;2013-08-30 21:10:00;10 minutes;Fiery Colored Silent Agile Ball Of Light. On August 29th, we witnessed a UFO in our area at 9:15 at night.  (See previous report.)  At 9:10, last night, we (Husband, myself and 2 Children) went out to the back patio and in the same area, at the same altitude, there was the same kind of UFO as we saw the night before. It began moving up, down, left right, in one general area.  Going up and below the tree line. We found this really hard to believe because of the previous night's experience. Same object golden, orangish colored ball of light. Zigzagging flight pattern.  Moving almost effortlessly.  After observing it for about 10 minutes, it lowered down and traveled S-SW until we could no longer see it.  About 20 minutes later, we saw it again, in the SW sky, but very high up in the air.   We watched it travel a vast length of the sky before disappearing after a minute or less.  About 20 minutes after that, we saw a slow moving aircraft approaching our house from the North.  As it traveled over our heads, it ha! d a low rumbling engine sound and we saw that it had 3 bright white circular lights on the underneath, forming a triangle with a red bright light in the center.  The lights were signaling in a beaconish sort of pattern.  White would blink and then the red. We have never seen anything like that either, but suspected that it was a man-made craft of sorts.  Certainly nothing like the fiery ball of light we had witnessed two nights in a row.  But the odds of seeing this recon-like craft about 40 minutes after our 2nd night in a row of a UFO sighting in the same spot, at the same time, was pretty strange, we must admit.  We will be looking in the same area in the low sky tonight at 9:00 to see if this ball of light appears again. Honestly, the strangest thing we have ever seen.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504

Orange Fireball moving SE to NW.;2014-04-02 20:28:00;1.5 minutes;Orange Fireball moving SE to NW. Fireball, orange in color, moving SE to NW ascending. Sky was clear with very light winds. Reminded me of the solid boosters of a rocket launch from Cape Canaveral but without a conical trail, a more round shape and very bright.  I first thought it was a helicopter with a search light but much too orange in color.   Next thought was maybe a military jet on afterburner out of Stuart Airfield, but as it passed overhead there was No Sound.  Faded to pinpoint in the NW sky in about 1.5 minutes.  Observed at 2028 EDT from  Lat Lon 27.15.43N 80.17.35W ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
4 fireballs hovering close above.;2016-03-18 20:00:00;5 minutes;4 fireballs hovering close above. 4 circular objects resembling fire moving slowly just over main road. Then in a split second all four traveled higher to the sky.  One seemed to have a dripping motion.  Almost as if I were dripping lava.   In less than 5 minutes, they were too far up to be visible.

Large Orange Globe enters earth's atmosphere, then shoots back into the sky.;2017-10-16 03:00:00;10 seconds;Large Orange Globe enters earth's atmosphere, then shoots back into the sky. I have waited to post this simply because I didn't believe what I saw and after looking this up and seeing similar sitings I believe this was something to report.  I was outside on my porch at 3am with 3 others when we noticed a large orange ball coming towards earth very quickly.  You could tell it hit the earth's atmosphere because it gained a cone or tail.  It proceeded to come closer for about 8 seconds and then shot back up into the sky.  It came down from the west and went back up in the east.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
