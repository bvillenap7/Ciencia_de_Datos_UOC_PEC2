two bright beams of light in the eastern sky;1998-03-07 18:45:00;5 MINUTES;two bright beams of light in the eastern sky I was in my driveway watching my young son and a few of the other neighborhood kids playing kickball in the street. One of the children pointed to the sky and asked me what those lights were. I looked up and saw what appeared to be two helicopter spotlights hovering / hanging motionless at slightly different altitudes in the eastern sky well above the tree line on the horizon. The light on the left was higher than the one on the right and there wasn't any noise coming from them. It became apparent to me shortly thereafter that these things were not helicopters. As I observed them, the light on the left began to dim and I noticed a shallow beam of light emenating from it. The faint beam of light broadened and narrowed as it swept slowly from left to right. This went on for maybe 10 seconds as the light to the right began to do the same thing. The dimming light on the left (towards the north) began to close in on itself slowly, sort of like the shutter on a camera, wrapping itself in a shroud of fog as it vanished. The second light, within seconds thereafter, did the same thing. Neither object moved up or down or side to side during this event. They simply vanished in the same position they were in initially. The entire event lasted approximately 3 to 5 minutes.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504

At about 5:33am, while waiting for my jogging partner, I witnessed an intense flourescent green light in the sky.  I have seen many shooting stars in the past and I can honestly say that this did not resemble that.  What an eyecatcher this light was! The light was still in the sky like an oval shape. I would say that this light lasted for about 25 secs, possibly less. This light did not move, then suddenly it just vanished in an upwards motion!;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504

I saw a bright light in the sky that did not move and suddenly vanished.;2008-09-05 19:30:00;8 seconds;I saw a bright light in the sky that did not move and suddenly vanished. I was traveling North on the Florida turnpike and saw a very bright object in the sky.  It was still daylight, and this object was a bright, bright, white color.  It was slightly northwest of the car I was traveling in as a passenger.  I’m guessing it was about 8-10 miles north of me and 3 or 4 miles up in the air.  The object didn’t move at all in any direction.  The light never strengthened or weakened, until it vanished out of nowhere.  It was a sunny day but it sure didn’t look like a reflection of any sort.  It appeared to be a rectangular object that looked rounded because of the bright light.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
four white lights, one larger, three smaller;2009-09-06 21:00:00;2 hrs.;four white lights, one larger, three smaller Don't know how long they were there before my son noticed them when he was returning home from a neighbors house a couple of blocks away on his golf cart.  When he got out front he told me to come out and see the lights moving around in the sky in the distance.  We watched them for about 10 minutes and got in the golf cart and tried to follow to see if there was an event or something in the area that would be shining spotlights in the sky...however there was no point of origin to the lights.  They were above the cloud cover so it seemed like we were seeing the reflection of the lights off the clouds.  There were 4 lights circling around, one seemed to be larger than the other three.  They would intersect at times but were going in a circular motion.  We watched for about an hour and then went home, keeping our eye on the lights.  When we got back to the house, they were still there.  We went inside and I kept checking now and then.  Finally when I checked at! around 11:30pm they were gone.  We wished we had seen how they left.  They stayed above the cloud cover, even though there were some clear spots in the sky, they would come just to the outside of the clouds.  My son tried to get some video of it, but we're not sure how good it came out.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
Four independent pulsating lights that formed a triangle shape then flew off.;2011-12-23 08:10:00;3 minutes;Four independent pulsating lights that formed a triangle shape then flew off. On Christmas Eve about 8:00 pm my girlfriend and her father went out for diner.  We were driving south on S.W. Del Rio blvd thru and upper lower to lower middle class neighborhood on the way to the restaurant  which is on Port Saint Lucie blvd at the end of S.W.Del Rio blvd.  About half way thru out our trip we all noticed three very intense pulsating lights in a evenly spaced horizontal line about 45 degrees above the horizon to the right side of the road we were on.  There seem to be a fourth object more to the right of the other and farther away because its light was smaller and deep red. As we drove closer, I turned right down a side road to roll down the window and turn of the car to see if they made any sound.  The three lights were pulsating red, magenta, pink and sometimes white in the center.  They  seem to be less then a mile away at the closest time and made no sound and no smoke. The night sky was mostly clear with a few small patchy clouds.  As we watched the three lights were all moving in a left to right (west) direction and then rearranged themselves into a triangle shape (two on top and one on the bottom).  The forth was moving farther away and getting harder to see as it went behind a small cloud.  The three lights stayed in a triangle shape for about 45 seconds while moving to the west together.  Then one at a time each light went father away about 45 degrees up and to the south towards a small cloud that was lighter then the sky so I could see that there was no other structure connected to the light i.e. wings or balloon etc.  One at a time they apparently followed the path of the fourth light but the three went thru the cloud and I noticed as each one would then become just a dim red light as distance and the cloud thickness changed its intensity.  The cloud was beginning to dissipate as the last light went thru it.  I waited to see were they would come out from the other side, but they never did.  I could see all ar! ound top and bottom of this now very small cloud and saw none of the red lights emerge out from behind the cloud.  About 45 seconds later a small airplane was flying a vector from the south east to the north west and was at the same level of the small cloud. I waited to see if the plane would fly in front or behind of the cloud, It flew behind it so I could gage that the plane was no more then 2 miles away when it  was behind and next to the cloud.  The plane lights were ver familiar looking and very different from the 4 lights.  Furthermore, after 2 days of thinking about it I had never seen lights any where every that looked like the 4 we saw.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
14-15 orange lights traveling in w western direction, no noise, lights satggered over about one mile.;2012-12-15 10:30:00;~5 minutes;14-15 orange lights traveling in w western direction, no noise, lights satggered over about one mile My wife was outside last night feeding one of our cats, I was in the house when she told me to come outside, there were strange lights to our south east.  I went outside and witnessed at first 14 or so ORANGE colored lights kind of staggered over a mile or so in the air.  They were all headed in a western direction and then faded out.  After the first group faded out, one last one trailing came in to view and faded out as well.  When I say they were staggered, I mean there was no relative shape to these lights, only one light after the other. Above and below each other as well.  Of note, there was no sound produced from these craft or we were too far away to hear any power source coming from these things.  We have watched the news last night and today hoping to hear what it is we observed but have heard nothing from the news or on the internet.  We did not have a chance to get a camera even though I had one in my work truck,  I wish we had though.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504

Myself and my wife were laying in bed watching late night news.  My sixteen year old son came into the room and announced he saw some fire works or flares out of the front living room window.   I then jumped out of bed and walked into living room, then onto the front porch.  My wife, son and myself then observed five lights (reddish orange in color) move across the sky in sequence one after the other.  These lights were no more than two or three miles away.  They were spaced five hundred to one thousand feet apart.   I went into the bedroom and got my binoculars and returned outside to observe with the binoculars.  All I saw was a more intense light.  These lights moved in my opinion the speed of helicopters, but with no sound what so ever.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
Unexplained lights in sky above Port Saint Lucie, FL at approximately 8:35pm September 08, 2013.;2013-09-08 20:30:00;10 minutes;Unexplained lights in sky above Port Saint Lucie, FL at approximately 8:35pm September 08, 2013 At 20:35 EST my Girlfriend called me in a panic stating that while walking her dog she witnessed approximately 15 extremely bright yellowish orange objects in the Northeastern sky traveling low and slowly as if floating Southwesterly without making a sound.  She also stated she could smell something burning and feel heat emanating from the lights and the sky surrounding the lights looked hazy.  She stated that numerous cars were stopping on a side street to witness the event.   After speaking with me she called 911 and was informed by the Operator that calls were coming in from Saint Lucie County as well as Martin County regarding the event. After a cursory check on the Internet I could find no information regarding a launch from Cape Canaveral.  There were also no fires reported in the vicinity of the event.   Oddly there have been no reports from the local media.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
Several red lights traveling from the north west towards the east and north again at  21:44 just above the horizon in Port St Lucie.;2014-03-22 21:44:00;5 minutes?;Several red lights traveling from the north west towards the east and north again at 21:44 just above the horizon in Port St Lucie. At 21:43 I looked north and I think a few miles distant from the Paar road area and not far above the tree line, I could see several, red lights in the sky that were traveling from west to east.  It was strange in that they did not look like they were in any specific formation, but an irregular group of lights spread out for quite a distance.   They seemed to be coming in from the north and then traveled slowly to the east and back to the north again.  It also seemed as the last couple disappeared that the lite turned whitish in color?   Even though the lights were above the treeline, it seemed that they were fairly far away.  I would say at least a couple of miles distant from the point where I was standing. My background is I am retired mid 50's male, and the vantage point of my observation was from our shoreline on the lake.   I was just buttoning up the house before going to bed when I spotted the lights.  Weirdest thing I've ever seen!;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504

Light move slowly in all directions with red, green, purple and flickering.  Video was recorded showing a round type object.  After the event we saw a helicopter flying around the area, probably a police or military craft by the sound of the engines.

It is cloudy and dark out.  The stars seem to have disappeared and these flashing objects have taken their places.  They all remain still in place scattered across the sky.  Flashing red and blue but if you look closely, it seems like there is a slight white flash as well.  We stood astonished..   I have never believed before but airplanes don't stay still, and certainly not for that long.  Our power has been going out all day, which is odd because it hasn't been bad weather..  My family and I are having a movie night and so we're renting movies off of the cable box, when it kept mysteriously going out.  I believe they are still out there.  We sort of got spooked so came back in.   I don't know what their doing or why there would be so many, but I did notice a cluster in one location, and suddenly around one prominent one, what looked like shooting stars in a cluster.  Could it be them flying in hyper-speed?  My imagination, curiosity and concern have never been so peeked at once..  I tried to take a picture but the lights didn't show up.   Hopefully somebody else can tell more..   I would love to know I'm not crazy.. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Armada of 15-20 red, orange, and white lights over Port St. Lucie, Florida.;2016-05-29 21:03:00;6-7 minutes;Armada of 15 to 20 red, orange, and white lights over Port St. Lucie, Florida On Sunday, May 29, 2016, just after 9:00pm, I was in my car with my husband and sister.  We just went through the northbound toll booth to enter the Florida Turnpike in Port St. Lucie, Florida, when I noticed about 15 to 20 lights in the eastern sky.  I was shouting, “Look at that!  Do you guys see all those lights?  What are they?”   So, my husband pulled over and he got out to take some pictures with his phone camera.  My sister also got out to do the same, but I stayed in the car, opened the window, and took some pictures and then I changed it to video.  There were other cars that pulled over to take photos, too. I took the first video until most of the lights had gone beyond the trees so I couldn’t see them anymore.  Then, I saw 2 more so I took a second video of those.  To my surprise, my first video of all of the UFO’s turned out to be just black.  Nothing showed in that video, but my second video when there were only 2 of them visible did record correctly, and I also have three still photos which were taken in succession that shows about 7 or 8 of them as the rest were beyond the trees when we had pulled over.  My husband’s phone was, for some reason, inoperable at first and then he was able to get 2 photos.  My sister’s photos were all black, like my video, but she did manage to get 1 photo of the last 2 ufos. For the record, some of the lights were white, some orangey, and some red.  It seemed like they were moving in formation but then some moved faster than others and then some disappeared.  In the video that I took that was visible, one light was white and the last one was very bright red.  When we first saw them before pulling over, it looked like a whole armada of ufos in the sky.  I’ve never seen anything like it! By the time we pulled over and I took my first photo it was 9:05pm, and my last video was taken at 9:09pm.   I am a business owner, and my husband is an attorney.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504

I grew up in New York City, and have been a Prosecutor in New York and Florida.  I am a retired Assistant State Attorney here in Florida.  Based on my training and experience, I know evidence is important.  Here we have 3 upstanding, credible citizens that saw unidentified flying objects (UFOs). On Sunday, May 29th, 2016, at approximately 9:04 pm., I was driving when both my wife and my sister-in-law shouted:  “Wow!  Look at that!  What are those lights up there”.     I looked up and saw about 15 -20 glowing objects in the night sky.  I had just entered the Florida Turnpike, when all 3 of us saw these lights.  I immediately pulled over to the shoulder and got out of the SUV to get a good clear unobstructed view of these flying objects.  Most were orange in color, some were white, and at the very end was a red one.  They were all over the place, and they were moving.  I did not hear any sound coming from them. I tried to take photos from my mobile phone but my phone would not work.  I had to turn it off & on twice, and then it worked, I was able to take a couple of photos.  I saw them for about five minutes.  What is even more surprising is that they all disappeared at about the same time.  My sister-in –law’s photos came out black, except for the last one which was clear.  However, my wife was able to take photos and a video.  I honestly don’t know what they were, throughout my life I have seen many things, but in my life I have never seen anything even close to this ever before.  I personally called 911 to report this.  Definitely, UFOs to me! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded.

I am unsure if these were crafts that had lights on them or if they were just lights but I don't see how they could have been just lights due to the way they moved.
