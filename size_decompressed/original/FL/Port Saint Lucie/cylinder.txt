Strange object  right after Shuttle launch;2009-05-11 14:04:00;45 seconds;Strange object  right after Shuttle launch Monday approx 2:04 pm I was watching the space shuttle launch with the aid of a telescope.  It looked like a normal launch like the many Iâ€™ve watched before except on this occasion I noticed a irregular object in the same vicinity of the shuttle just as the shuttle went out of view.  To the naked eye it looked cigarette shaped and was moving rapidly to from West to East.  As I focused on the object it appeared to be cylinder shaped and was moving horizontally.  I did notice what appeared to be fins towards the aft of the object but it was not identifiable to any aircraft I have seen before.  I short it looked like a missile (no wings mid ship) flying horizontally at a very fast rate of speed.  I've watched airliners before thru a telescope and compare the rate of speed to be far faster than a commercial aircraft.  There was no vapor trail or any sign of exhaust.  I'm not saying this was extraterrestrial but I have a good knowledge of aircraft military and commercial and have never seen anything like this before flying in the manner (horizontally) it was.  I hope someone else in South Florida witnessed the same thing.  My location is Port St.Lucie Florida roughly 12 nautical mile inland of the beach and I was looking ENE about 45deg of the horizon ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded sincere to us.  He has aviation background.  PD));27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
Cylindrical, metallic object with no wings or tail moving slowly and noiselessly from north to south.;2018-11-16 16:45:00;10 minutes;Cylindrical metallic object with no wings or tail moving slowly and noiselessly from north to south. One metallic object.  Cylindrical, with no perceptible wings or tail moving very slowly from north to south.  There was no sound.  I spotted it near the rising moon directly east of where I was standing.  Another individual saw me and asked what it was and remarked that it was moving slowly.  I asked if he saw any wings and he responded that he did not.   He then stopped another passerby to verify what we were seeing.  That individual also remarked at the object's low speed and lack of wings.  It proceeded south in a straight line and constant speed until it became too small to be visible.  This was not a balloon.  The attitude and altitude of the object remained constant with no oscillations or tumbling.  It was impossible to ascertain the size of the object as we couldn't know its altitude.  My best guess would be the size of a commercial airliner.  Its slow speed, no sound, and lack of wings or tail all made it remarkable.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
