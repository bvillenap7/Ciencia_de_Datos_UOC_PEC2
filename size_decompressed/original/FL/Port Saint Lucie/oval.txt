thought it was space shuttle lift off;1991-06-01 10:30:00;5 minutes;thought it was space shuttle lift off Have not spoke about it since because when I first saw it with my friend at the time , which since we have not spoken or seen each other, I told a few people and they pretty much thought I was crazy. But how could two people see the same thing not once but twice in one week.  Once with my friend and the other with my then girlfirend who thought I was crazy until she saw it her self. Me and my friend were at mellaluca lakes in port st lucie fl. at around 10:30 pm we looked toward our left ,(toward kennedy space center just north of st lucie) and we noticed something we thought was the shuttle lifting off at night, because of the orange glow coming from underneath as if it were a lift off. The strange thing is that it was acending very slow and straight up not at an angle like the shuttle does and as sure as I said that to my friend the light shot straigt up what looked to be at least 3 miles up in the blink of an eye I mean rediculously fast.Before I knew it the thing started coming our direction I had to be at least 5 miles away and was over the lake we were at within 2 to 3 seconds and when we saw it hover over the lake the whole sky reflected off of it ,it was about the size of a vw bettle and there were two lights on top long ones moving back and forth. It was very quiet no sound but the crickets and frogs man, dont know what it was but my bud s! tarted shaking and upon trying to start his car I asked him not to beacause I wanted to know if what we were seeing was real. Had him decribe what he was seeing and it was exactly what I was seeing so I know it was real.  I stepped out of the car and proceeded to walk toward the lake edge to get a closer look at it hovering( 50ft or so in air) as I opened the car door and stepped out it straighted it self out went side to side across whole lake which was at leat half mile wide, zig zagged about 7 time and shot straight toward palm beach county in the blink of an eye. Never believed in UFOs but have  since.  Saw it a week later after everyone said I was crazy. Standing out back my house was the second and last encounter. Looked over toward the lake ,( by this time my girl had already said she had enough and she didnt know if she believed me. About ten min later looking toward  the lake we both noticed a bright light which appeared to be a spot light on a small plane. Almost out! of my mind at this time because I thought I was going crazy f! or what me and my friend saw just days before. Anyway looked like a spot light on a small plane started to get brighter and brighter so I took my lighter and started flickering it just because I guess , but as I did it me and my girl noticed the spot light start to flicker as I did with my lighter. Kinda creepy my girl started to wonder at this time because the more I flickered my light the more the spot light did the same as it came our direction over the pine trees. As it got closer we heard what sounded like a prop plane single engine. At this time my girl pretty much called me crazy and said ,see it's just a plane man i agreed and said your right. All of a sudden the plane noise changed to a helicopter sound. My girl started to weird out about this time and wanted to go inside.I told her hell no please stay i said everyone thinks I crazy. She agreed and at this time the noise coming toward us change into distinctly what sounded like a jet engine noise,but the light coming towar! d us was moving slowly. Until right about 5 seconds later there it was no sound just quiet. No more plane sound no more helicopter sound no more jet sound just hovering over a 40ft pine in my back yard. It sat at an angle with this weird  feeling we were being watched. My girl started crying and I asked her what do you see? Her reply, I see it I beleive, and continued to cry. I told her to go in the house and get my mom and her husband and to quietly walk out the back door to see. She headed toward the house while I just looked in awe. I heard them come around the front of house instead of the back ,looked over to tell them to hurry, looked back up and saw it fade out of view in front of me and a little flickering light appeared and began moving so fast and in ways no plane we have could have moved with such precission and no sound. Unfortunately my mother and her husband did not see it as we did. I was still called a lier even after my girl told them what she had seen. N! ote we were not believers until these events occured. As for m! y friend he was the smart one he never told anyone and said he wouldnt.. We have not spoken since the incident nor have I ever seen it again.I know this is very old sighting but please tell me I am not crazy or else how could I remember it as if it were right in front of me now. This happened when I was sixteen and am now 36 . I know I saw something i could not explain. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
3 unidentified craft;1999-01-13 20:50:00;4 minutes;3 unidentified craft 3 orange fireballs traveling at high velocity, then slowed down. Two of them were flying in formation while the other one trailed behind. After slowing down to almost a complete stop, all three disappeared one after the other. They were bright orange, and the lead object was blinking somewhat. They flew by for about 3-5 minutes, i managed to get a few snap shots with my 35mm but who knows if they will come out. regards mark;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504

It w;1999-11-14 22:05:00;25minutes;Saw an orangeish , yellowish, goldish, self illuminating craft.  It illuninated only itself and did not light anything around it.  It was the size of a small Mall - extremely large.  It made no sound.  It was terrifiying experience.  We felt compelled to run towards the light and did.  We did not want to run toward but did run toward it anyway. We went for a walk at around 9:30 pm.  We ended up walking about a Mile and a half and we were standing on a dam over the C- 24 Canal when we looked up in the sky and saw the self luminating craft.   It was a orangish, yellowish, it lured us to go closer but we were scared and wanted to run away but couldn't turn away. We ended up walking about anouther mile trying to get closer to it. The next thing we know we were walking in the other direction and we realized that we had lost approx. two hours of time !!!  It was now 1:30am !  We were drained of energy however we were not sweaty at all.  We never heard any sound coming from the craft.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
I SAW THEM AND NO THERE OUT THERE;2000-11-30 11:50:00;20 min.;I SAW THEM AND NO THERE OUT THERE they were round like stars some came straight down and others came down on angle at a high rate of speed and had no tail.one large one went east and west.I seen about 50. the sky was clear. ((NUFORC Note:  Although this is a cryptic report, NUFORC takes it seriously, nevertheless.  We spoke with three witnesses to the event, and they all agree on the basic details surrounding the incident.  Approximately a dozen witnesses were looking at the sky to the south, when they all observed small, apparently distant objects streaking generally downward in the vicinity of the Sun.  They may have been self-luminous, but it was difficult for the witnesses to be certain of that.  The phenomenon is reported to have continued unabated for more than 20 minutes, during which the witnesses observed not fewer, they estimate, than 100-150 of the small objects.

Oval ufo with lights hovers light shoots away from it and comes back, light like spotlght shines straight to ground.;2011-05-05 15:00:00;15 minutes;Oval ufo with lights hovers light shoots away from it and comes back, light like spotlght shines straight to ground. In May, June and July of 2011 always around 3 in the morning I could not sleep and had a sense of something outside.  Got up and looked and saw a UFO.  Round or oval in shape with lights that seemed to rotate the object or go back and forth on it.  I have seen three of them together over the skys of Port St. Lucie.  At times I saw beams or a dot of light that would shoot out from the craft and shoot back to it.  I decided this was not a plane, planes are not stationary like these were, this was not a Harrier either. The next time I saw it I decided I would try and get a picture of something.   Well I did and the photos showed lights colored lights but one photo had what I thought to be two beings on it.  One whitish blueish in the upper left corner of the photo and the other to the right and top of my flash reflection in the photo since I was taking it through a window on my patio.  The clearer of the two is greenish, has horns and like a collar of sorts but ! he looked to have a mustache.  Some friends I have shown the photo saw the being too,some could not.  On another occasion I saw same shaped ufo with lights hovering with a white light beam going straight down to the ground from it it was there for quite a while I was watching but then fear gripped me and I stopped watching.  I have not really talked about this due to the craziness of it. I also tend to here a sound of something hovering it is very distinct like a frequency of some kind.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
Bright Orange Flame like Orbs in the sky over Port Saint Lucie Florida;2011-12-31 23:30:00;25min;Bright Orange Flame like Orbs in the sky over Port Saint Lucie Florida We were setting off fire works when we noticed these round orange Orbs moving slowly and silently across the sky.  We kept an eye on them and they would slowly disappear going straight up into the sky abouve us very quickly.  They would reappear coming from different directions one at a time about ten minuets apart. This went on for about an hour.  I got it on video and they looked like bright silent fireballs. We also saw them on Christmas eve about the same time at night.  Don't know what they are but are pretty strange.   Can some one find out for the public what they are it looks like they are being sighted all over the world.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504

Several lights in a straight line and then disappearing above the stars.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-29 21:40:00;30 seconds;Several lights in a straight line and then disappearing above the stars. My spouse and I were walking our dog (heading North).  We both happen to look up and see 5 stars appearing to be in a straight line.  But, upon looking closer, 3 were heading straight upward.  The 2 remaining lights were stars and stayed in one place.  There was some distance between each one.  As they went up, much higher than any plane/jet, each one disappeared in the exact same location as the one in front of it.  There were no clouds in that direction.  We know that because the 2 remaining stars continued to remain bright and in one place.  NOTE:  Absolutely no sounds.  But, perhaps they were too high to be heard???  I'm certain that I saw 3 possibly 4.  My spouse is absolutely certain that there were 4.  They were too close to be satellites.  Also, they were heading upward which makes it highly unlikely that they were meteors.  It was the most unusual thing I've ever seen in the sky.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
