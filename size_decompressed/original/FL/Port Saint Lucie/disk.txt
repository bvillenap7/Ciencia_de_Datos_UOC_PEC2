2-3 UFOs sighted in Port Saint Lucie estimated date-Saturday or Sunday in 1997-1999.

After watching Larry King this evening I decided to reflect on a UFO sighting that I had. While traveling on a major road in Port Saint Lucie I and other people in the vicinity spotted un identified flying objects above a line of trees on the eastern side of the road. The other cars slowed down as did I. The incident was actually reported briefly on the 11:00 PM local news that evening. I would need to look for the exact date but it was in the 1997-1999 range. It was a Saturday. I can find the exact date because my husband had a golf tournament that day. We have some dated souvenirs from the event. At the BBQ after the tournament I shared what I had seen with some close friends. Later that evening the news cast mentioned it. They had had some calls and therefore asked various military and weather experts about activity in the area. No valid earthling events had been occurring that match what people had seen. The road is adjacent to Port Saint Lucie Blvd. It runs into the turn pike entrance. It is a north /south roadway connecting Port Saint Lucie Blvd to another major roadway. I was traveling with my four children. My children saw the objects also but were rather young at the time and more interested in their play toys than what Mom was seeing or saying. The objects were disc like in shape. They hovered above the tree line. As fast as I saw them, was as fast as they left. To the best of my recollection there were two to three. As other people that have seen UFOs can probably attest to, by the time I processed what I was seeing they were gone. The string of cars on the road all slowed down to get a closer look at what we were witnessing. On hind sight, I wish we had all pulled over to share what we had just witnessed and exchanged contacts. But as I said, when it actually is happening the feeling of shock and disbelief is rather overwhelming. All I know is what I saw and that I will not forget it. I am a professional of sound mind and body. I was not under the influence of anything and have no reason to make this up. Actually with the stigma attached to those that claim to see UFOs, it isn’t something that I’d invent for attention. In my profession, making “crazy” claims can lead to career fall outs. I am happy to see that so many creditable people have seen object that can’t be identified and are coming forward to share their sightings. In closing, do you think the ants know we are here? As they build their intricate ant hills and communicate with each other, they most likely have no idea we are functioning as a society. We know the ants are here but really take no special interest in them on a daily basis. Some ants may encounter human beings but have no real idea how to incorporate that into their “ant universe”. For me, the same concept can be applied to UFOs and human beings. Thank you for providing this valuable web site. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Orange saucer sighted by two for 4 minutes over western/central FL 8:10pm on 02.02.2014;2014-02-02 20:10:00;3 minutes;Orange saucer sighted by two for 4 minutes over western/central FL 8:10 pm on 02.02.2014 Clearly saw huge bright orange disk fading to red at the perimeter of the glow... with the red favoring the leading edge (streamlined combination flattened/round shape with tapered and pointed ends) (like draping a sheet over Saturn) or (vacuum forming two flat plates over a baseball but not to a perfect vacuum... retaining a curved taper between the round center and the flat disk).  Its brightness gave the distinct outline a glow that made the object appear nearly twice the size of the distinct outline.  I spotted it over central/western???  Florida from 8:10pm to about 8:13pm 02.02.2014 from Treasure Coast, Florida.  Object was originally moving NNNW from the vicinity of the southwest everglades, possibly the west coast of Florida??? and almost imperceptibly faded off to NNW... somewhere around 10-15 degrees when passing Tampa direction/area??? dead west of the Treasure Coast. The object was much larger than any known aircraft and was moving much faster than ! any normal jet... and not very high in the atmosphere like you would expect from experimental trials. At first I was able to clearly make out the outline within the glow but then the outline was obscured into an orange-red blob as the distance increased. Object disappeared as if headed to western FL panhandle. Afterwards, the sighting was followed by what appeared to be individual rockets launched about two minutes apart seemingly originating from SW FLorida coast at approximately 8:30, 8:32 and 8:34pm and more launchings at 10pm. Cannot confirm these times like I can the original sighting until I check my camera. Repeated launchings were sighted past 10pm. The later sightings of the much smaller, much slower rockets??? were traveling in a more westerly direction towards the Gulf. The first few rockets started out in a more northerly direction and later rockets veered further west. I only say rockets because two of them appeared to have staged a booster separation soon after sighting. Booster separations??? were consistently timed/located/dropped SWW off west coast of FL and rockets??? disappeared on various trajectories from NW to NWW towards Gulf). Of the multiple rockets??? seen... two clearly staged separations that were distinct... looking much like a short lived blue-white light being dropped like a bomb.  Both separations??? drops??? occurred in virtually the same location.  The rockets appeared to be reddish, and about 1/40th the size of the object disc??? (flattened, pointed football shape). I took pictures of both the disk??? and the rockets??? but I was late on the draw and the distinct outline had already blended with the glow prior to my first shot.  I was not able to time the photos with the actual staging??? of the rockets.  Videos of the rockets taken are useless.  No video of the original object sighting was taken during its brief sighting. I made the original sighting and managed to share the sighting with my dad after getting his attention.  The rocket??? launchings which followed were seen by the whole family. No noise was heard from any sighting.  Can provide images but I doubt they will be of any use. Enlargements don't show details or clear outline.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
This was a disk shaped bright white light, very fast,;2014-12-14 20:36:00;3 seconds;This was a disk shaped bright white light, very fast, I am a manager in retail. Traditionally religious, my imagination could not prepare me for what I saw last night while driving north on US-1 with my 17 year old son.   As we drove in conversation, we noticed a white flash in the shape of a saucer fly west from the east end of Hutchinson Island.  There was a plane flying north about ten o'clock from where we were driving and this UFO flew west past that plane as though it were standing still.  In my life I have gone fishing and have seen planes and even shooting stars.   I am no expert, nor do I want attention or any gain at all, but this was not of this earth. The event is life changing.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
