I went to investigate looking up and down the block and saw nothing . It was when I turn around to go back in side I saw very clear these 5 possible 6  glowing  green lights in the sky.  It was a very clear night with a full moon.  Luckily I went outside with my new iPhone 12 decided to take a picture  you can clearly see all five objects and then two three seconds later I took a second picture.  At that point the objects spin away at a very rapid speed east towards the ocean.  To the naked eye the objects look like around a uniform disk.  Upon examining my photographs I can actually see that they had some type of sweep   back wings.  Similar to horsefly.  At first I thought it they were drowns.  But drowns have blinking lights usually red white.  They had neither they just glowed a emerald green color I have pictures.  You could see their change in position in the photographs to prove that they were moving.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
