Circular object emitting strong bright light moves unlike any man-made aircraft we know of today.;2012-12-24 23:00:00;20-30 minutes;Circular object emitting strong bright light moves unlike any man-made aircraft we know of today. On Christmas Eve 2012 I noticed circular object emitting a strong bright light. it appeared out of nowhere. It zigzagged moving very fast. It then took off and the size of the object was greatly reduced as well as the strength of the light it emitted. I was hoping someone else was outside at the time, but after it disappeared I noticed no one else was outside. As I approached my home I had saw my neighbors outside I looked up and the object appeared out of nowhere again, traveling at great speeds and it was a very strong light emitting from the object. Luckily, my neighbors were outside and they were waiting for family for Christmas Eve to arrive. My neighbor actually had a camera around his neck, I shouted to him look up look up. My neighbor was outside with his two young daughters and we were all amazed at how this object traveled and how it disappeared and then reappeared. It had disappeared and reappeared three times in total that night up to about 12 AM. My neighbor took several pictures of the object. This had no characteristics of a plane or helicopter, it moved at such speeds and such different directions that it could not have been anything we know of right now. It was able to hover, take off, and hover, disappear then reappear. The light it gave off was captivating. My neighbor and I are waiting for the film to develop. I am very excited to see how this object looks on film. I can assure you, there is no way possible it was a plane or helicopter. Without a doubt it has to be defined as as a UFO. One more note,the light this object was giving off was so bright that you couldn't really make out the shape of the object. But, when I had seen it appear out of nowhere as it went across the sky I could see somehow, the top of the object. The top was a circular shape, like I could make out the top half of the object. I don't know if because it accelerated out of nowhere that I could make out the top half of the object, but after that the light was too strong to see the physical shape of the object. The light that was a emitting from it was a circular shape, like a fire ball.  Note- the film still has to be developed. If my neighbor was able to get the image in his shot, of which I am positive he did, it should be amazing proof as I have never seen a thing like it. Please inform me of the best way to send the images. Thanks.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
Rudolph's red nose ?   big red ORB on christmas eve.;2015-12-24 21:15:00;10 seconds;Rudolph's red nose ?   big red ORB on christmas eve. On the night of December 24th, for the first time in well, many years, my wife and I found ourselves alone on Christmas eve,  We had since our oldest daughter (33 at the time ) always taken a drive around town to look at christams decorations as what would become a tradition for us, but this time we were alone.  But , we chose to take a drive anyway, maybe more for the memories of times past  then for us . We figured we take a short drive and go straight to the high end neighborhood of Traditions , with their multi million dollar homes and see what they had.  We drove through their neighborhood and realized that folks just were not decorating the way they use too.  Dissapointed, we decided to head back home , on our way home I noticed a house on a side street that had a nicely decorated house and decided to take a side trip and get a look,  It was a sub division with one way in and one way out , basically just a big loop, we admired the house lights and continued! driving and realized we were coming back around to the entrance road,  That's when my wife noticed a light over my left shoulder and said ( look ! what's that ? ) as I looked over my left shoulder I saw the biggest red ORB ever, it was 9'-12' across, moving around 100 mph from east to west , about 50' off the ground , I tried capturing it on video, but my camera wouldn't capture the light, I was able to get off one image as it was heading away, ( p.s..)  I do have the video recording in which you can hear my reaction to what I'm seeing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD));27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
Very odd.  At about 11:45 pm on New Years Eve, I what appeared to be 2 orange orbs moving from the SE to NW direction.;2015-12-31 23:45:00;8 minutes;Very odd.  At about 11:45 pm on New Years Eve, I what appeared to be 2 orange orbs moving from the SE to NW direction. Very odd. At about 11:45pm on New Years Eve, I what appeared to be 2 orange orbs moving from the SE to NW direction, passing directly over my house as I stood in the driveway.  I watched as the approached from a distance.  At first I thought they were 2 helicopters, but as the got closer I noticed they were flying relatively low (perhaps 700ft?)  and there was no sound or any lights to indicate port and starboard.   The only light emitted was an orange glow.  As they passed over my house, I walked from the driveway to the street and faced the NW to watch them.  They appeared to be ascending but as they did, the light faded to a mere dot and then I could no longer see them.  They were not moving very fast at all….no erratic movements.  Just a moderate, steady pace and what appeared to be a steady climb.  They did not seem to move further away from each other.   I thought perhaps someone was flying drones. I then noticed more approaching….3.  They all flew the! same heading, no erratic movements.  More followed. In 3's, except for the second to last wave.  There were 5 grouped together, then finally 3 more for a total of 21.   The first 2 were from the SE, whereas the remainder seemed to come from a more due-south location, but all ended up passing over my home and headed NW/NNW.   I never heard a sound and after passing over the house…maybe 500ft beyond the house, they seemed to just continue to ascend and lose their glow, fading to no light at all.  But the lights didn't seem to disappear due to climbing in altitude.  They just stopped glowing. I could no longer see them.  It was almost like watching lantern light turn extinguish as you turn the knob.  Really very strange.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504

I was just taking a picture of the storm coming in.  I thought the sky looked cool seeing the sun behind the clouds and a clear sky in front of the clouds. I dont kno if it's an optical illusion, or ball lightning or if it's a ufo or if it's nothing.  I didnt even notice the object until today when I was just playing with my phones photo effects and spoted it an thought well that dosent like normal.

I watched an orangish orb slowly move across the clear night sky.;2017-03-18 19:00:00;3 minutes;I watched an orangish orb slowly move across the clear night sky for a period of time and then just disappeared. I was staring eastward into the night sky from my home in Saint Lucie West, when a bright orange orb begins to cross the sky from north to south.  I'd say it was approximately 45 degrees from the horizon.   It was moving rather slowly for about three minutes, when it came to a stop.  About 30 seconds later it simply disappeared.  The instant vanishing together with the glowing orange luminescence convinced me that it wasn't a helicopter.

While outside in my backyard, looking at my neighbor's bush tree, something punch through the sky  and drop almost to the ground then stop.  It righted itself and flew into a hole in the cloud and came out another hole in the cloud.  it tilted to show me the top of the craft and then flew off.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
