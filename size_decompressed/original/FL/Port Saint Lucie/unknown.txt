Christmas tree colored sparkling lights hovering over the southeastern sky in Florida;2007-12-02 22:00:00;45 minutes;Christmas tree colored sparkling lights hovering over the southeastern sky in Florida A friend and I had gone out to the movies. Upon our return I happened to glance up and saw among the stars, something that stood out and was different from all the stars.  Upon closer examination with binoculars, my friend and I saw christmas colored lights kind of sparkling on the two crafts that were hovering in the southeastern sky over the Indian River or Atlantic Ocean area estimated to be perhaps 8 to 10 miles away. The two objects remained still but sparkled red, green, blue and yellow and one seemed larger than the other.  We watched for about a half hour or more until our necks got tired from looking up. These were obviously not airplanes or satellites. Another passerby saw these crafts also and agreed that they were something not like anything he had seen ever.;27.2827718849839;-80.3620214057504
