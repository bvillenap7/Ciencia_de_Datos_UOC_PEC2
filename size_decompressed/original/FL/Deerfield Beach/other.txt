black dot not moving high in the sky;2005-06-19 17:00:00;10-30 minutes;black dot not moving high in the sky ok me my father and his friend were sitting outside on fathers day the 19th between 4 and 7 p.m. i dont recall the exact time. my father (who does not believe in ufo's whatsoever) spotted what appeared to be a small black dot very high in the sky (south east direction) not moving. the 3 of us continued to watch the object for 10 to 15 minutes, the object did not move at all in this time. when viewed threw binoculars the object appeared to have shape or in otherwords was not just a dot. the exact shape however could not be determined. after about 15 minutes of observation the object was covered by passing clouds for 30 to 45 minutes, when the cleared there was no sign of object. as i mentioned my father does not believe in ufo's, the 3 of us however did determine that it was much to high to be any sort of bird or plane not to mention the fact that it did not move at all.  NOTE: this is not a fake report just to get folks excited i simply would like to know if anyone else in the area noticed the object for personal clarification purposes.;26.3106059523809;-80.1255547619047
Witnessed an object in the a.m. twilight.  Was to my M, moving from W to E.  ((NUFORC Note:  Atlas V launch.  PD));2015-09-02 06:00:00;2 minutes;At approximately 6 AM, September 2, 2015, I witness an object in the morning twilight.  It was to my north and moving from west to east at a speed that was neither fast nor slow.  It looked like a re-entry of a spacecraft.  The leading object was bright white.  A very large elliptical trail extended from behind the object.  The trail was very long and very tall.  As the elliptical trail closed it was followed by a linear trail of bright white smoke.  The smoke lingered for 10 minutes after the object moved out of sight to the east. ((NUFORC Note:  Atlas V launch from Cape Canaveral.  PD));26.3106059523809;-80.1255547619047
