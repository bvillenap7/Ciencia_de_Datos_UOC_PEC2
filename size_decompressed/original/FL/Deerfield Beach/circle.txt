aircraft flying in the vicinity only;2002-12-23 20:30:00;2230;aircraft flying in the vicinity only My husband and I noticed this object a few nights before my husband and I filmed it on 12-23-02.  The first time we filmed it we caught a fireball flash across and out of sight in front of the UFO.  It has come around the same time every night for about 10 days now(around 2030)  I recorded it again on 12-26-02 and have very good footage than the first time...the night was clear, no clouds and you can see the object changing colors.  I am very interested in knowing what this object is and getting it analyzed.   I served 5 years in the USAF and have good credibility. If you know of anyone who can analyze this video tape please contact us with the information. Greatly appreciated ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information!  PD));26.3106059523809;-80.1255547619047
2 dark circles moving parallel in the sky and disappearing abruptly after few minutes;2016-01-16 17:54:00;3 minutes;2 dark circles moving parallel in the sky and disappearing abruptly after few minutes I was by the pool relaxing and had my eyes closed for a few minutes, but I felt the need to open my eyes and look to my top left to the sky.  At first I thought I had some dots in my contacts or something affecting my vision from having my eyes closed earlier.  But as I blinked it didn't go away.  First thought was like are those balloons?  And at first the 2 objects were not that far from me so that's why I thought the balloons are raising into the air.  But then I knew there were not balloons as they had the same distance from each other and going in the same direction. beautifully parrellel.  There was no specific sound, calmness really.  The 2 objects kept moving NE but higher to the sky from the initial point I saw them.  As soon as I realized this may be something, I started to taking a video and picture with my phone.  However, my video stopped recording after some seconds so I tried another video and it only did a few seconds so I just kept trying to take pic! ture and zoom it as much possible to get a better view. It latest a few minutes.  I actually called my mom to tell her and she said she was close so I was telling her I will go to her to show her and my dad.  However, our connection failed.  So I recalled and said I am coming but as soon as I said that I saw the 2 objects slightly move to the left and disappeared instantly.  I wanted to share my experience with others because I am certain this was a unique UFO experience.;26.3106059523809;-80.1255547619047
