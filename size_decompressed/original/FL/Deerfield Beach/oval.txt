At first I thought they were Chinese floating lanterns like in the movie Tangled (Disney) but said to myself they were moving too fast and up too high but still below the low cloud levels of the night and it wasn't windy.  Then someone said they were night time parachuters or parasailers - but they wouldn't do that at night unless it was military and we did not hear any motor or engine sound nothing.  And it definitely was not a plane or helicopter or fireworks.  We all came to the conclusion that they had to be a UFO. They sailed silently across the sky lit with red and orange lights seemingly going faster and higher as they head further west.  Once they lined up perfectly 3 across but that could have been due to the angle we were looking at, then the one to the left faded.   I think it got concealed above the clouds.  Then the one to the right disappeared a few seconds later, then the center one just got further and further away seemingly going faster heading west still lit until it faded assuming due to range.  The center one did not fade into the clouds or over the horizon, it just faded into a clear patch of sky while heading west.   This is my account others may be different but to me and others present this definitely was a UFO (remember the objects was unidentifiable).;26.3106059523809;-80.1255547619047
