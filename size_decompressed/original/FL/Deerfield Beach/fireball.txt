((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch at 2055 hrs (EDT).  PD))   Shuttle Early?;2005-04-29 20:58:00;2-3 min;Shuttle Early? I don't Believe in Alien craft, I'm reporting this for clarification.  Driving on powerline Rd.(Deerfield Beach) heading North approaching S.W. 10th ST. Saw a Huge Fireball Streak in the due north sky about 30-40 degress up from horizon. fireball lasted for a good 30 sec to 1 min. Streak went behind some light clouds and 3 glowing dots emerged in a > formation pointing east.then went behind another cloud and came out 2 faint White/Grey dots. I lost sight ot them for about 20 sec, Parking my car. Looked again and saw 2 Very Faint Dots Closer Together. Then as i was wondering if maybe i was looking at a plane or a star, 2 Doughnut like pulses very visible! First thought was a plane crash or a plane losing an engine. Called 911 just to report it Transfered from county to deerfield police dispatch. as I was Describing this event, the county voice interupted and said there was a shuttle launch,in which the deerfield dispach said I witnessed history. I thought cool, but i heard that the shuttle was posponed for weeks. I checked NASA.com and read report that on this day @ 10:00 am they announced that the launch will be postponed until July? I thought wierd so i wrote this. Possibly it wasn't the shuttle , just a rocket Kennendy Sapce center is North of where i live. just thought i'd give input. ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the witness describes above the launch of a Titan IV missile out of Cape Canaveral, which occurred at 20:55 hrs. (Eastern) on this date.  The missile apparently was launched to the northeast, so it was visible along the eastern shoreline of the U. S..  PD));26.3106059523809;-80.1255547619047
saw explosion or similar in night sky;2006-05-04 06:00:00;10 seconds;saw explosion or similar in night sky Written on May 6, 2006 at 6:28 AM:    Question: I saw something odd in the sky on May 4th, approx. 6:00 a.m. in the east. I live in Deerfield Beach, Florida. It was not a shooting star, but more like a comet, but it hung in the sky for a second and then dissappeared. It had a bright tail that remained also, and then faded away slowly. The body looked like it exploded and also slowly faded away. I know nothing about astronomy. I have seen many shooting stars and meteor showers. It was not either. I am 51 years old and have seen many things in the sky but nothing like this. I have been looking on line but cannot find anything except reference to the meteor shower referencing the remaining fragments of Haley's comet that might appear during this week. I will not rest until I find out what this was, as it was so awesome. Hope you can rest my mind.  Background: Curious person, 51 years old. No background except the wisdom of the newlyelderly. ((NUFORC Note:  We may have received other reports about this event, but we do not know what caused it.  It may have been a meteor, we believe.  PD));26.3106059523809;-80.1255547619047
