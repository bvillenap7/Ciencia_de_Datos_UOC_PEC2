Flashing red,blue & white lights, hovering over deerfield beach in florida;2003-10-13 01:00:00;15 mins;Flashing red,blue & white lights, hovering over deerfield beach in florida I was getting ready for bed, I heard a strange noise. It almost sounded like a very loud car engine so I muted my television. The sound began to get muffled & lower. I looked outside the window & above the trees I could see red,blue & white lights. At first I thought it was just a plane or a helicopter, but the object didnt move. The lights continued to flicker so I just continued to watch. After 5 minutes I woke my husband up to also look at it. I really thought I was seeing things. But there its was an object in the sky with flashing lights. I kept walking away & going back to look at it. My husband thought it was a plane also, but even he said its not moving. 10 mins later a plane was flying nearby & 5 mins later it just disappeared. Did anyone else see these lights in the sky over southern florida, early wednesday morning between 1a-115a ?;26.3106059523809;-80.1255547619047
