It moved like a jelly fish and looked like it was plasma. I was thirteen, and at night I often liked to lay down in my front yard and observe the stars. One night, I did just so and noticed something weird in the sky. You can tell it was very far away, but it was huge. I would compare its size to two football fields. It was shaped like a triangle with one open end. More like a boomerang, but more narrow like a triangle. It was moving along sort of like a jelly fish swims. It looked like the sky was water, and it was swimming in it. It also looked more like an aligned trail of plasma lights. There was no metal it just looked all like plasma. So anyway, I was lying in my driveway for about a minute just watching this thing, I couldn’t get a picture even if I wanted to, it was too dark out and I didn’t have a camera handy. It was just “swimming” in the same direction for about a minute, and then it just dissipated into the air. It didn’t just disappear, it sort of disinagrated into the air. It was the strangest thing I had ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));26.3106059523809;-80.1255547619047
