8 bright white lights ...unidentified shape...;2010-09-04 20:55:00;30 minutes;8 bright white lights ...unidentified shape... upon arriving at our home, I noticed a large bright light directly above a tree in a nearby yard--the object was due Southwest--my daughter looked at it and then went inside.  I stood and watched it--unable to tell the exact shape, but the object had 8 lights that went out periodically, but I suspect that the lights weren't really going on, but rather cloud cover.  It never moved, however, I decided to get back in the car and drive due southwest to see if I could get a closer look.  As I drove west, I kept an eye on it (as best as I could while driving)---followed west approximately 3 miles, but couldn't see it anymore (not sure if it was actually still there because of the clouds.  When I returned back home, I looked in the sky above the tree southwest of my home,...it was gone.;26.3106059523809;-80.1255547619047
Four orange spheres in sky over Deerfield Beach, Florida, 1/11/14.;2014-01-11 19:20:00;3 minutes;Four orange spheres in sky over Deerfield Beach, Florida, 1/11/14 We saw 3 large orange lights in the sky flying in a triangular formation going north over the beach with a single orange light following behind approximately one half mile.  There was no sound, the speed never changed.  The objects were flying low.  The size of the lights were large compared to lights you see on an airplane.  The lights appeared to glow like a flare.   There was no smoke.  The lights never dimmed out and the wind was southwest.  If the lights you see on an airplane are equivalent to the size of a golf ball these lights were about the size of a soccer ball or a basketball.
