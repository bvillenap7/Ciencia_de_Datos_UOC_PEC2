Strange lights sighted over Deerfield Beach, Florida May 8, 1998 at 9:40 PM for 5-10 minutes.;1998-05-08 21:40:00;Approx. 5-10 minutes;Strange lights sighted over Deerfield Beach, Florida May 8, 1998 at 9:40 PM for 5-10 minutes. During a sighting which lasted in total no more than 5 to 10 minutes, I initially saw a very bright white light beginning at 9:40 PM on May 8, 1998, while I was driving northbound on I-95 about 2 miles south of the Palm Beach County line near the town of Deerfield Beach, Florida, which is a few miles north of the town of Pompano Beach, Florida.  There was good visibility with few clouds while the Moon was also visible and approximately 2/3 full in the night sky at an apparently equivalent elevation but well to the south of the bright light.  Having seen something unusual looking,  I pulled off on to the right shoulder of the interstate and got out of my car to better observe what was occurring.  This bright white light appeared to be a few miles north of me and was slowly moving in a southerly direction parallel to and somewhat to the east of I-95 coming towards my position.  At first, the unblinking white light appeared to have a short contrail which later disappeared when the bright white light changed into a less brilliant unblinking red light which then appeared to split into 2 such less brilliant, unblinking red lights that moved apart but remained side by side and separated by a some distance from each other.  Both continued to move slowly in a continued southerly direction.  At about this point, I noticed that there was a third, unblinking, dimmer red light which preceeded the other two by some significant distance, perhaps one hundred to a few hundred yards, which was also slowly moving in a southerly direction and to the east of I-95 towards my position.  Eventually the 2 following red lights dimmed to the level of the leading dim red light and shortly thereafter, the pair of following red lights continued to become dimmer until they quickly became too dim to be visible while the single nearer red light, though dim, continued to be visible for another couple of minutes until it also disappeared as it approached my position.  It should be noted that even though a short contrail was seen at first, at no time was there any sound associated with these lights as there should have been if what had been observed was merely a jet or an airplane, (the latter of which don't produce contrails).  Also, jets usually leave very lengthy contrails that remain visible long after they have passed which was not apparent in this case in the night sky that was well lit by the Moon.  I believe that what was seen could not have been a rocket or space shuttle launch from Cape Canaveral (which is a couple of hundred miles to the north) due to the close proximity of what was observed and the slowness with which the lights moved only a few miles over a period of 5 to 10 minutes.  Also, all planes, jets and helicopters have some blinking lights, but none of these lights blinked on and off. Finally, although these 3 lights appeared to move synchronously with each other, the background of the well lit night sky could be seen between them, so that they ultimately could be seen to be spacially separated.  As an addendum to this report, I would like to state that I had attempted to contact a few police departments local to the vicinity of the sighting at that time in 1998 but that I was then unable to obtain confirmation that anyone else had seen or reported a similar sighting until ten years later in 2008 when I first learned about this web site of the National UFO Reporting Center.  Whereupon, having checked my original written account of the sighting and searching this data base for the same date, time and location, I finally discovered that one other individual had reported a sighting that matched mine with exactly the same date, time and a very nearby location and although his description differs somewhat from mine there are overall quite a few elements in common between the 2 accounts.;26.3106059523809;-80.1255547619047
4th of July Curiosity in Deerfield Beach, Fla;2012-07-04 22:30:00;2-3 minutes;4th of July Curiosity in Deerfield Beach, Fla While filming my friends shoot off fireworks in Deerfield Beach Florida, the entire party witnessed a glowing red/orange object travel west off the Atlantic ocean.  It did not demonstrate the capabilities of any helicopter or light aircraft I'm familiar with, nor was it displaying the requisite port/starboard lighting.  The object traveled due west off the coast, just to our north, and then faded away.  I'm emailing the video I shot with my phone.  An obvious police aircraft was seen traveling along the coast, from north to south, immediately after.;26.3106059523809;-80.1255547619047

The other travels a bit, then disappears.  They looked like the ends of a rocket when you watch a launch, 1 single bright orange ball.  There could not be planes.  Planes have lights on the edge of each wing, usually white or red and blue.  Those types of lights were not present.;26.3106059523809;-80.1255547619047

White light zooming very fast across the sky.;2016-10-24 23:30:00;1 second;White light zooming very fast across the sky. I am a 34 year-old doctor of clinical psychology.  I was walking my two little dogs.  It was after 11pm but before midnight. I saw a light, much bigger than a star, but much smaller than the moon, zooming across the sky. It went east to west, or from north-east to south-west, in a straight line and disappeared into the clouds.  The whole evet was south east to my location. It moved so fast that it crossed about 1/3 of the sky in about 1 second.  It was so fast that I could not notice details about the form of the light.  I was under the impression it was not a perfect circle, but it was really hard to tell.  I would also say it stayed the same size as it zoomed across the sky, but again, I could not be 100% sure.  The lightâ€™s color was white, just like the moon.   I continued looking up to the sky for several more minutes but saw nothing else unusual.  There were airplanes going by, slow and steady, with much smaller, blinking lights, and looking nothing at all like the other light I saw.;26.3106059523809;-80.1255547619047
Two minus one magnitude stars suddenly disappear.;2019-09-25 06:29:00;2 minutes;Two minus one magnitude stars suddenly disappear. Looking at the sky this morning.  To the right of the Orion Constellation.   I viewed to very bright star like objects which I had not observed the previous morning.  I was intrigued so continued to observe.  The objects started to fade from view, but it was not due to any clouds.  I am an amateur astronomer, so I know my way around the sky.;26.3106059523809;-80.1255547619047
