I they kept the glow the whole time. The stayed the same speed and did not curve they traveled straight and all in the same direction. They were traveling at a good speed not to fast I had time to second guess myself at least 5 times. They were moving and had a stream of light behind them not the same amount of brightness but as if it were giving off light or heat as it moved. It was like a bright ball with ___________________________________________________________________________ that much of light behind it. They were traveling in a group but no in a straight line. They were kind of staggered.   x x  x  x            x   It was incredible! I Know it was aliens.. It HAD to have been!!!!!!!!!! They pass  me but not directly over head. And just kept going as if they went so far i could no longer see them. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
