PD)) To the naked eye it appears as a bright star changing colors. This is a circular shape which appears to be elongated bars of light extending from the center of the circle to the outer edge. These bars of light are white, red, and blue . They seem to be pulsating in intensity. I also detected a smaller very bright white light which dropped away from the main body and then appeared to move back into the circular object or possibly revolving around behind it. I have seen this same ufo once before about a month ago. It is in the Western Sky at about 40 degrees.;28.3631526376152;-82.6736415137622
