STRANGE HUM WITH STATIC  FROM THREE TRIANGULAR SHAPES;2006-10-23 16:00:00;3 MINUTES;STRANGE HUM WITH STATIC  FROM THREE TRIANGULAR SHAPES I WAS WORKING IN MY BACKYARD AROUND FOUR PM. IT WAS A CLEAR SUNNY DAY WITH NO AIR TRAFFIC NOTED. WHILE I WAS WORKING I HEARD A SLIGHT HUMMING NOISE ABOVE AND BEHIND ME TO THE EAST. AT FIRST I DIDN'T PAY ANY ATTENTION AS THE NOISE WAS NOT LOUD. MORE FELT THAN HEARD. THE HUM SEEMED TO INCREASE SLIGHTLY WHICH CAUGHT MY ATTENTION. THEN THE HAIRS ON MY ARMS AND HEAD STARTED TO RISE LIKE STATIC CHARGE WHEN YOU RUB A BALLON ON YOUR HEAD. I LOOKED UP TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON. THE HUM WAS DIRECTLY OVER MY HEAD. WHEN I LOOKED UP I DID NOT SEE A CRAFT OR CLOUD OR ANYTHING. WHAT I DID SEE WAS LIKE A SOAP BUBBLE. THE MORE I LOOKED I COULD MAKE OUT THAT THERE WERE THREE TRIANGULAR SHAPES WHICH SEEMED TO DISPLACE THE AIR. THIS IS HARD TO DESCRIBE. IT SEEMED LIKE THE TRIANGLES WERE REFLECTING OR BENDING THE LIGHT AROUND THEM. IT WAS LIKE LOOKING AT THE SKY THROUGH A SOAP BUBBLE. THE ONLY REASON I REFER TO IT LIKE THAT IS BECAUSE THE TRIANGLES WERE DEFINATE BUT ONLY BECAUSE THE SKY AROUND THEM SEEMED TO BE BENT OR DISPLACED. THE TRIANGLES WERE MOVING IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION TORWARDS THE GULF. THEY WERE MOVING SLOWLY IN A STRAIGHT LINE IN A VEE FORMATION. AS THEY MOVED AWAY FROM ME THE STATIC FEELING ALSO DECREASED. THE STATIC FEELING SEEMED TO INCREASE IN INTENSITY AS IT GOT CLOSER TO ME AND WAS VERY STRONG WHEN DIRECTLY OVER MY HEAD AND DECREASED GRADUALLY AS THEY MOVED AWAY FROM ME. SO, I NEVER ACTUALLY SAW A CRAFT. I WAS THE ONLY PERSON THAT I KNOW OF THAT EXPERIENCED THE SIGHTING. MY ELDERLY MOTHER WAS INSIDE THE HOUSE AND DIDN'T SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING. I HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THIS TO HER OR ANYONE ELSE. I AM REPORTING IT HERE BECAUSE IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I KNOW WAS NOT ORDINARY. I AM NOT REALLY SURE IF IT WAS A UFO BUT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Nocturnal triangle with multicolored lights. 3 seconds duration, 1 observer.;2019-12-06 20:45:00;3 seconds;Nocturnal triangle with multicolored lights. 3 seconds duration, 1 observer. Dog wanted to go out. I took her through backdoor and into sun room, but at first she seemed afraid to go outside, so I went first. I checked the sky, as is my habit, in time to see a triangle-shaped formation of multicolored lights coming into view from behind the top of a tree, almost directly overhead, flying from east to west. Estimate about ten lights, white, orange, blue, red, not changing position with respect to each other. And there was no sound. Guessing altitude was a few thousand feet at most. Speed consistent with normal aircraft. There seemed to be a solid object behind the lights.  It was a clear, cold night, and I could see the half-moon to the south.  When the object again disappeared behind the trees in our backyard, I went back into the house. Afterward, the dogâ€™s behavior was crazy for a few minutes.  She acted very disturbed.;28.3631526376152;-82.6736415137622
