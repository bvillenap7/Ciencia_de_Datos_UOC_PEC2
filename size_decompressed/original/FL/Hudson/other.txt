Sitting in back yard  just past 2:00pm. Clear sunny day.  Happened to notice a flash of  light in sky maybe 12 miles or so north of Hudson, Fl.  Light was not a landing light or reflection.   A small dot of a craft was visible, much as a jet is visible in front of a contrail in high flight. Unable to determine shape.  Flight was erratic, in and out of a contrail, above and below it.  Also flew west to east along contrail.  Not a normal flight path for an aircraft at 30 to 36,000 ft. agl.  Object was dark in color.   I tried to video it with my cell phone to no avail, object was to far away.  Wife was with me but she is nearly blind, she couldn't see it.  I live in Tampa air traffic area and am familiar with flight patterns.  Object may have been in Hernando County.   I happened to see a B-17 last Wednesday in Brooksville air space from the golf course I work on in Hudson.  Told my boss about it.  He thought I was nuts till picture of it was in the local paper the next day.   I am a veteran of naval aviation.  The B-17 was at Brooksville Regional Airport for tours last week.  What I saw had nothing to do with that.;28.3631526376152;-82.6736415137622
