Small orb, constant light, sparking dripping drone-like 20 feet off ground.;2012-06-14 23:00:00;3 minutes;Small orb constant light sparking, dripping drone like 20 feet off ground. My wife and i were walking down a street at night.  As we were walking a light was behind us. We assumed this was a passing car.  We were in a residential area suburb.  As the light refelct at our backs we moved to the side of road, never looking back, assuming it was a car.   After about 1 min and a half, we were talking and the light i noticed was no longer reflecting behind us, but reflecting a shadow of tre branches beside us.  We looked to our left and a small basketball size object was floating about 20 feet off of ground.  It was a constant light, about 20 yards to side of us.  Floating just above a roof top on a corner lot home. It was not sparking constant not super bright now.  But dripping sparks.  The light then just disappeared.   For about 30 seconds we stood there in disbelief, and was struck with fear so much that we were scared the whole way home.  There was no motor sound, the trajectory was not that off a flair.  It seemed like a drone of some type.  We never posted it because i didnt know something like this was availible.  But hey if it helps with other sightings.
