Three lights in a perfect triangle formation travelling almost due north.  No sound could be heard.  Lights about afar apart as in Orion constellation.  In this triangle formation, the point light was in the rear.  Crossed the sky in about one minute staying in a perfect triangle.  This was also the night of a meteor shower which is how I noticed it.;28.3631526376152;-82.6736415137622
