Strange lights over the gulf near Hudson Beach, Florida;2010-12-14 03:15:00;30 minutes;Strange lights over the gulf near Hudson Beach, Florida Last night I observed a colorful light moving in a small area about 200-300 feet above sea level.  The movement was erratic and it first I thought it was an airboat spinning around and moving over the shallow flats, but there was no sound and as it moved it became obvious that it was above the water...several hundred feet.  The object was approximately 1 mile offshore.  The lights were red, green and blue with a spotlight pointed straight down. There was a haze around the object...making it blurry to the naked eye. The object was visible for almost thirty minutes then simply vanished...almost like someone turned off the lights.  I tried to video the object but my camera did not register the light...it was a black screen.  I walk my dog almost every night around 3am and we just moved into this new house.  Trust me when I tell you that I will be looking every night for this object again!;28.3631526376152;-82.6736415137622
