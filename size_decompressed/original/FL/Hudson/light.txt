Other than stars, aircraft are very common in this area (coast gaurd).Having travled this same road for the last 8 years,I know it is very dark, and the stars just jump out at you.But this time it was differant. This star had an inverted light comming from it.In other words,the beam was large at the top,and small at the bottom. Like it was foused on something. Ive seen lots of spot lights, but this was differant.What it was I dont know, but I do know it was not a United States air craft of any kind.
