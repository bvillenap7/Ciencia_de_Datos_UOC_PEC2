Small cube shaped object with several blue lights visible.  Object faded out of sight.;2000-10-22 19:30:00;10-15 seconds;Small cube shaped object with several blue lights visible.  Object faded out of sight. Observed what appeared to be a small cage-like object with several small blue lights all over it in the shape of a crushed cube, but only the size of a basketball.  It appeared to be wavering, almost as if it were dangling from a short string yet no string or wire was seen or found. It traveled from west to east at approximately 5 mph.  This was in a residential area with overhead street lights operating.  Observed through the front windshield of automobile.  It flew approximately 20-30 feet in front of automobile and was in a gradual descent over the road.  The object simply faded out of sight right in front of us.  Not behind trees or bushes, just faded out and was gone.  We both immediately exited the car and searched the area where it was descending to. Used the car headlights to illuminate the area.  Found nothing. No one else was around.  We immediately came back with flashlights and searched again.  Found nothing.  Went back the next day and checked the entire area during daylight and found nothing.  What makes this so odd was the apparent size of the object and the fact that we both had a clear, unobstructed view of it right in front of our car, 20-30 feet away. That was very close so it was easy to estimate the size of the object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));26.062;-80.3368
