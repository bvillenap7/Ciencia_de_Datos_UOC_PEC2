10-21-14  Orange ball of light in sky over Cooper City, FL;2014-10-21 20:00:00;3 minutes;10-21-14  Orange ball of light in sky over Cooper City, FL While letting the dog out I looked up at the sky to see a hazy orange ball of light in the sky.  It was silent &  moving from North to South.  It was not high up in the sky-I'd say maybe 2000'.  It was South of the West to East flight path for Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood airport.  To the North of the flight path there was a small, white ball of light that seemed to be hovering.  By the time we found the binoculars it was either gone or went behind a cloud.  It seemed to fade away! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));26.062;-80.3368
