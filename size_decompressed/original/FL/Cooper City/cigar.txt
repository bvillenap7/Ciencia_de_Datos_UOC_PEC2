Craft was not metallic, but looked white, with what appeared to be black accents.  No windows were visible.  The craft seemed to be at the altitude that general aviation aircraft fly.  It had no wings, horizontal or vertical stabilizers.  It maintained a straight line motion (no turns) from a south direction towards the north.  We could not determine the speed of the aircraft.  We were driving north on Hiatus Road and the craft was to the west/southwest of our car.   By the time we cleared some trees that temporarily blocked our view, the craft had disappeared.
