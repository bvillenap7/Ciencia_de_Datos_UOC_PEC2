My son was looking out of my office window when he cried Hey Mom, a meteor! We rushed outside to see a shape in the distance above the treeline that was bright and sort of shaped like a teardrop with a hole in the center - though that could have been a trick of the light. At first it seemed to be stationary but then it became clear that it was moving very slowly in a downward arc. We noticed an airplane (obvious because of the vapor trail) moving in that direction, intersecting it and passing by. Finally the object was below the treeline and we could not track it any longer. About two minutes later (and this may have nothing to do with the other) was saw two planes going in opposite directions (again, we could clearly see their vapor trails) and one had a black object following behind it and the black object had no vapor trail. We continued to watch until they were out of sight. Certainly I do not know what I saw and my son is only 11 so he is fully prepar! ed to be invaded by aliens. The original object was odd and moving in an unexpected way for any kind of plane or helicopter and, as I stated, I am not sure that the second black object behind and below the plane was anything at all related to the first.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812
