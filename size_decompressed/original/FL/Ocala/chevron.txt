V-shaped object, dim lights almost cloaked like stars but moving quickly.;2015-10-11 00:30:00;5 seconds;V shaped object, dim lights almost cloaked like stars but moving quickly. I was with two people looking at the stars in our backyard when I noticed something moving in the sky, I was the only one to see it but I was pretty excited trying to point it out in the sky.  The object was a V shape it's lights were 1 at the tip of the V and three on each side. The lights were so dim that it was almost to me like a cloak, because the lights were also the color of the stars like a dim blue.  The object almost had what seemed to be outlined.  You could see it was darker than the rest of the sky which is why it caught my attention, there were no other aircraft in the sky and it was clear no clouds around.  The reason it was seen for only a few seconds was because of trees.  The object was moving very quickly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
