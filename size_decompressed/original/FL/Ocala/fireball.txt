Midnight White Oval / Fireball UFO;1997-12-17 00:15:00;10 seconds;Midnight White Oval / Fireball UFO Back in December 17th at Midnight, I was outside walking my dog, and within a couple of feet off the sidewalk, I turned around to the East and saw a Bright White Oval / Fireball UFO (Somewhat similar to the effect of a bright flashlight on the wall and moving fast to distort it).   The craft was too bright to distinguish any type of surface nor any sound to indicate an engine.  It went south, then turned rapidly to the West and disappeared. From my aviation experience, it was going 400 knots and 300 feet above the ground.   The turn radius was most likely 20 feet as it changed direction.  And the way it was moving, it appeared to actually been following the lit roads as if a going by Pilotage.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812

From the viewable distance, the object appeared to be quite large. I will guess maybe 20 feet in diameter. The falling point was bright white in color followed by red embers just behind the fireball that was followed by a white trail. It was very much larger than any meteor or falling star that I have ever seen. I expected to hear a sonic boom or an explosion as it seemed to crash near the center of Ocala from my viewing position. After reading resent reports, I think this may have been a piece of the Cosmos. I will be glad to give a more detailed report if required.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812

Bright orange light turning to white and disappearing quickly;2018-07-22 02:00:00;2-3 minutes;Bright orange light turning to white and disappearing quickly My husband and I were driving on the Florida turnpike heading to Orlando for vacation and saw a bright orange ball of light that seemed to be hovering.  We just passed the Ocala exit.  My husband thought it was a tower lgbt, but it looked to high to be that.   All of a sudden, it seemed to elongate and then turned bright white and disappeared, as if it was headed up into space at the speed of light.  Then, it seemed to reappear in the distance as a dot similar to what a star looks like.   It was the strangest thing weâ€™ve ever seen.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812
