Unknown bright lights.;2013-11-15 18:20:00;5 minutes;unknown bright lights My sister and i was in the car heading home and i saw what looked like a helicoptor from undernear...realizing that it did not look like one as it went over us at a red light.  It looked like a skinny diamond with only really bright shinning lights at the corners.  It was very large as it seemed to be far and was moving faster than a plane and looked as if there was a light green bottom..  it moved fast as if it was landing in a straight line.  There are no none helicoptor bases or airports in that dirrection.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812
