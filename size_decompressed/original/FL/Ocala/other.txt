He pointed in the sky and there were 8 objects in the sky that looked like stars but we're moving.   We sent the drone up as high as we are allowed to take it and still couldn't see what they were.  We then got binoculars and could still barely see anything but looked like a star.......they moved North moving around each other and then disappearing act nto the sky.   They hovered over us for about 10 min before heading north.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812
