Metallic Cylinder seen over North Florida;2011-10-14 17:45:00;4 minutes;Metallic Cylinder seen over North Florida I am a 51 yr old male blue collar professional. My girlfriend and I were on a motorcycle ride today 10/14/2011 between the cities Williston , Fl. And Ocala, Fl.  On highway 27 eastbound.  The sky was very clear, no cloud cover, still very light out. At approx 5:45 pm.   We both noticed an object to the S.W. in the sky.  I know airplanes generally travel at around 30,000 ft.  The object appeared to be at a greater altitude.  We were traveling at 70 mph. The object appeared o be stationary. The object appeared to be Metallic cylindrical with dark line wrapped around  the  center of the body. It almost looked like it was 2 pieces that were attached. I was driving and there was no traffic in  front  of or behind me. I kept looking up at it. I looked at it probably 10-15 times in a matter of 30 seconds. The objet appeared to sit in the same location for about 2 -3 minutes so I got to look at it a lot. Then it started moving S.E. and gaining altitude. I watched it keep getting further away and higher in the sky. I watched it until I lost sight of it.  My girlfriend could also see it but with limited detail. She did not have her glasses on.  The whole incident lasted about 5 minutes.  I don’t believe it was a commercial airliner due to the altitude. I don’t think it was a weather balloon because it kept in a straight line the entire duration.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812
