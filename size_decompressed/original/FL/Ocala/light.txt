It was like a orange light behind a vapor or cloud. It was headed south also very slow and was maybe 100 ft or so off the ground. I slowed down and pulled over to the shoulder of the road to grab my bonoculars. Before I picked them up the object split into two objects then came back together as one. When I focused the bonoculars on the orb it blinked out. With bonoculars you can see an object( plane or helicopter ) even with the lights off but this object was completly gone. I was very surprised. But what makes this stranger is that about 4 months later I was moving from Roswell Georgia to another part of Roswell about 5 miles away. It was about 2:00am when I was driving south on hwy 9 when shockingly I saw the same object directly over hwy 9 about 75-100 ft in the air! It was kind of pulsating behind that same vapor or cloud. I drove twards it and slowed down and stopped directly under it. There was no sound, it was just floating very slowly maybe 1-3 miles per hour. I jumped in my car and drove home as fast as I could which was only about 2 miles away to get my bonoculars again but when I got back it was gone. I wish I would have stayed to see where it went or what it did. I swear to you what I am telling you really happened. Thank you for your service because there is really not to many people I could tell about that event. PS if you need any volunteers to help out in any way with your company please e-mail me and let me know. Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD));29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812
Observed ten to fourteen or so lights appearing similar to stars all traveling in the same direction.;2002-10-16 22:00:00;1-2 minutes;Observed ten to fourteen or so lights appearing similar to stars all traveling in the same direction. Observed ten to fourteen or so lights appearing in all repects similar to stars all traveling in the same direction, (southwest I believe) at the same speed, in no discernable formation.  The objects appeared to be moving together as a group.  Night sky was clear, but with light low level haze.  Objects were observed from a vehicle traveling at speed.  Possibility of the objects being reflections of vehicle lights ruled out by blocking all reflections with hands, face against the window.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812

I seen a blunt horizontal oval light streak through the sky then lifting up while in flight and turning red then blue and disappearing;2010-08-14 23:00:00;2 seconds;I seen a blunt horizontal oval light streak through the sky then lifting up while in flight and turning red then blue and disappearing To begin with, my mother, my girlfriend, my nephew, and i were all in my mothers car on the way home from a house warming party. I myself in the driver seat while my mother riding up front, sat in the passenger seat.  When the sighting occurred my mother and I were the only ones who were able to witness it because my girlfriend and my nephew sat in the back seat, meanwhile my nephew was sound asleep. Next, we seen a streak of light above us, similar to a shooting star.  First it appeared to be a shooting star, then in astonishment, it appeared to be in a horizontal oval, it didn't just shoot through the sky fading from sight.  At the sight of this abnormal object it seemed to be traveling in the same direction we were headed, but to my suprises not as slow as an airplane or helicopter, and at first not as fast as a shooting star.  Yet it seemed to be going at an acceptionally fast speed.  It also didn't have any sound, in reference to any airplane or jet.  Which a jet would have been a good explanation except the fact that a jet doesn't fly silently. In addition, this object in the sky didn't appear to be flying at a high altitude.  In fact it seemed pretty low as if it were a helicopter trying to find someone or something.  At first it was just a stream of light then it came lower then it was, not by much but still a little lower.  Then it suddenly picked up speed and the aluminescence grew into a stream of light trailing a ball of light.  Then it seemed to reach a higher area in the sky and at this moment it changed colors immediately from white, to red, then instantly blue and within a fraction of a second it was gone.  It almost seemed to have maybe gone behind a thick cloud, due to the weather we've been having.  Then my mother and I realized, there wasn't any clouds in the immediate area of the night sky. Ultimately, the sight was both shocking and surprising, given it all occured within the most two seconds, or less.  I confidentally believe what I witnessed wasn't anything in our United States technological capabilities, unless it was an SR-71 Blackbird in central Floridas air space.  It's one of the only flying objects to my knowledge that would fly close to the speed, without sound, and disappear from sight instantaniously with little conflict, compared to what I witnessed.  Besides the SR-71 doesn't hit an immediate warp speed and aluminate in red then blue and disappear.  I know it sounds tampered with but the object had a blunt oval shape to my sight, possibly due to the engle of visual but to my knowledge it was practicaly oval.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812
blinking light in sky remains in same location;2010-11-15 20:42:00;10 minutes;blinking light in sky remains in same location I was staring up into the night sky, and I noticed a light blink. It was small, and looked very far away, but it was still very bright. I kept my eye fixed on the area, I assumed it was a plane and wanted to see which direction it was going, but this blinking light did not move.  It blinked seemingly every 10-15 seconds.  The light was white, no color. I called my roommate out to look and this blinking light baffled her too.  After watching this light blink every few seconds in the same spot for about ten minutes, I went back inside, I came back out another fifteen minutes later and it was gone.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812

The objects I seen looked like 2 little moons very close to each other (bigger than planets, but a little less than half the size of the moon,same color of the moon, no craters or marks.also there where no trails or blinking lites, no frills.Now the road I was driving on is in an 8 house gated community with 1 road and a cul-de-sac,and I was on my way to the other side of this road when I spotted them and automatically knew this wasnt normal(THERE IS NOTHING THAT BIG AND THAT CLOSE TOGETHER)  I know my night sky.  Why I didnt stop I am still kicking myself today,but I did roll down the window and stared as I creeped up to my neighbors driveway.   AS soon as I arrived they started fading out, I might have stopped at this point and watched,they didnt get smaller and it seemed they were covered by earths shadow. That same day at Silver Springs(which is the direction I saw them,NE of Ocala,someone esle ha! d strange things happen to them.All these areas are close to the Ocala Nat.Forest.But what really prompted me to redifine my report was the Gainesville couple on june 17?  How can you disbelieve that.My daughter is a gator living off campass there.If this couple is working at UF and they risked writing a report like that ,my hats off to them.I know what I saw,  They did too.I'm a believer that something is definitely close out there.  Can anyone answer me, I would love to talk to the other 3.   I need to know Im not the only one seeing them. P.S. no color changes or flames,all white on a clear night.  P.S.2   When I looked at a reference star from where I first saw them and then again at the last place, I can say they were moving slowly.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812
Bright red light moving in a straight path across the sky, and suddenly vaporizing into thin air.;2012-06-17 21:00:00;30 seconds;Bright red light moving in a straight path across the sky, and suddenly vaporizing into thin air. I was driving North on I-75 in the Ocala FL area, although the precise location is not known beyond this. It was approximately 9pm, and it has just gotten dark. There was no cloud cover, so both stars and other planes could be seen in the sky quite clearly. This object appeared as a bright red light, fairly large and round compared to any other flying craft I have ever seen. It moved in a straight forward motion without flashing any lights. It seemed to be traveling faster than any plane or jet I have ever seen, but did not have any similarity to a shooting star, and it was not going down or up. These unique attributes caught my eye, but the real surprise was when the object suddenly vaporized into thin air. Again, there were no clouds in the sky, so it was quite surprising to see this bright object suddenly disappear with no trailing off or fading into the distance.  This is the only time I could say that I have witnessed what appeared to be a UFO. There was no other significance to this event, at least nothing that was apparent to me.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812
4.7.13  1:00  Ocala, FL  Light  1 minute  Red illuminated light the size of large pea traveling NW from the SE.;2013-04-07 01:00:00;1 minute;4.7.13  1:00  Ocala, FL  Light  1 minute  Red illuminated light the size of large pea traveling NW from the SE Sighting: Sunday, April 7, 2013 Time: 1:00 AM (approx.)  Location: West Marion County (nearest city Ocala), Florida. Conditions: Warm, clear skies, stars, air still and no moon that I remember. I was sitting on the porch, which faces East, with my Chihuahua Jake on my lap having our ritual late night one on one time, when I looked up and to the SE I observed a fire engine red illuminated ball of light about the size of a large green pea, held at arm’s length, at about 40 degrees off the horizon.  It first appeared to be stationary, but when I averted my eyes for a second and looked back it was moving to its right, my left, in a NW direction, almost over my house. My observation lasted approximately 1 minute.  My gut feeling is it was 200 to 300 feet in altitude and an air speed slower than an Ultra Lite aircraft, although, I have no way to really know.  There was no air traffic observed at the time. There was no structure connected to the light and it was as bright and unchanged going as it was coming. It made no sound.  The night was silent, in fact, it was one of those nights you have every once in a while where you suddenly realize the silence was almost deafening. I didn’t notice the red illumination reflecting off anything in the yard or on the porch during the entire sighting.  It seemed to be self-illuminated. There were no other lights connected to it or around it. It continued NW until obscured by the top of trees. I failed to report some previous sightings from years ago, but, thanks to my brother Scott’s encouragement I’m reporting this one.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812
12 slow moving orange lights over 20 minutes period.;2014-01-01 00:30:00;~20 minutes;12 slow moving orange lights over 20 min. period Sighting: 1-1-14 12:30+/-am thru12:50+/-am Location: SW 38th Ave, Ocala Fl. Weather: rain/overcast/not windy   As I was driving home from work south along SW 38th Ave(along side of I-75) I noticed off to the right through the windshield (approx 2 o”clock position) along the top of the tree line, two bright reddish orange lights separated by what I would guess a few hundred feet in the sky below the cloud layer (it had just began to sprinkle rain again) of probably a 200-300ft ceiling.  My impression was that they were no more than a mile or less away from me.  At first I couldn't tell if they were moving. As I proceeded I did perceive they were moving slowly, not in tandem but the same general direction.  They didn't seem to be joined.  They move towards the southwest, almost paralleling my route.  NO other lights or “navigational lights” were seen.  After about 2 minutes the light farthest west of me disappeared.  Followed by the second one at approximately the same point in the sky a minute later.  I could not determine if they just turned off the lights or flew above the cloud layer or just disappeared. VERY weird. As I continued driving I couldn't stop thinking about what I had just seen.  A minute or so later I had the urge to look at the same spot where I had first seen them to see if there would be more and much to my shock there were EIGHT more strung out over I would guess a distance between a half to one mile long.  There was no type of formation to them, just scattered across the sky.  All exactly the same color and intensity as the prior two.  They followed the same movement as the first two.  Again they didn't seem to be joined together in any way. I watched them as I continued driving for the next 2-3 min.  I finally got so frustrated that I had pay attention to driving I simply stopped the car in the road got out in the light rain to watch them unimpeded.  I watched for another 2-3 min.  Again my impression, based on the low cloud cover, was they couldn't have been more that a mile away from me.  Probably placing the one closest to me no more that a half a mile maybe less.  I could hear NO sound coming from them.  I even cupped my hands behind my ears for at least a minute to try and determine if they were engine driven. NO sound.  They then began to “disappear” one at a time just as the prior two had.  WIERD. At this point I was exhilarated and could wait to get home and tell my wife. I was very disappointed that I was so close to home but could make it there to rouse my wife to see them in time.  Well one more time as I turned down my street I looked back to the same spot and once again I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT, there in the sky were two more.  Same as the last 10. I raced inside to get my wife up to see them.  She WASN'T happy.  Until she looked out the bedroom window to see them.  We watched them for a couple of minutes till they followed the others to the southwest and finally “disappeared”.  Made no sense to her either.  Now she can't say I'm crazy.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812
A total of 3 objects with lights dimming in and out and were moving upward;2014-06-24 22:00:00;10 minutes;A total of 3 objects with lights dimming in and out and were moving upward We were sitting outside and noticed what appeared to be stars lighting up and slowly moving upward.   Then the object would dim it lights for a few seconds and appear to be gone and then it would light up again and begin to move.   There were a total of 3 lights who would do this for a total of about 10 minutes.  They were in a triangle formation and the top object or light seemed to be the brightest and was moving upward the most.   Very interesting to watch.  It was as if they were trying to imitate the stars but stars don't move. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
