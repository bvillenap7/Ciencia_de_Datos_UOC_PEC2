rectangular, transparent, huge object  with points of red lights at each intersection moving slowing and low through the night sky.;1986-12-01 22:00:00;10 minutes;rectangular, transparent, huge object  with points of red lights at each intersection moving slowing and low through the night sky. It was late in the evening in December 1986, when I walked out of my house to have a cigarette.  Two family members went with me.   As we stood talking, a very huge object became noticeable in the sky passing over our house.  It appeared to be very low in the sky, but was difficult to actually tell just how high.  The shape was odd because it looked like a rectangular building on its side with red points of light at each intersection. Must have been around 8 -10 points of light.  The strangest thing was that it seemed transparent.  We could see the sky through it even though it was a mass of some kind that we could tell was moving through the sky. The object made absolutely no sound and was moving what seemed to be very slowly, almost as if it was floating.  As I said, it was huge.  It was not a formation.  We could actually see an outline of the object as it moved. As it was very close to Christmas, it never even crossed my mind when I went in to report this strange object to the local Sheriff’s Dept., that they might think I was perpetrating a hoax.  When the Sheriff’s Department came on the line and I proceeded to ask if anyone had reported an object going over the town, I suddenly realized that they may think I am pulling a prank relating to Santa Claus.  I was a little embarrassed, but they said no one else had reported this.  In later years I also reported it on, I believe, MUFON, when it was not required that you pay a membership. Almost twenty years later, a security guard and one of my family members, who had witnessed this event,  were talking and the security guard related a sighting he had at the same time and the same description (before this family member ever said anything to him).  Amazing! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812
Stationary, rectangular object seen in north-central Florida.;2012-04-27 19:30:00;3-5 min.;Stationary, rectangular object seen in north-central Florida. I was driving west on SW 20th Street in Ocala, Florida at around 7:30 PM. There was still daylight and the sky was blue. I happened to glance up through the front windshield and saw an object in the sky which grabbed my attention.  At the first instant, I thought to be looking at a plane since there is an airport in the area. Also, the end of the object nearest to me had a strobe light the other end had a red light. It was then that I noticed the object was stationary, not moving in the air, i.e. hovering. The object was approximately 200 feet above me and continued to remain stationary.  From the ground, the object was about the length of my index finger.  It was black, rectangular in shape, silent, and had no wings.  Part of the rectangular end with the red light had a “missing” space shaped like part of a circular radius. I continued to stare at the object to make sure of what was being seen, but then had to return to watching the road.  The traffic light at the approaching intersection turned red (SW 20th & SW 60th) and I stepped out of my car to get another look at the object, but there was no sign of the object neither from looking directly above me nor to the horizon. This is my second report of a sighting since living in north central Florida.  My first sighting was on March 2, 2006 and is posted on www.ufoevidence.org Case ID: 841. I’ve never seen anything unusual in the sky that could be termed a “UFO,” until 3/2/06 at age 53. Thanks for reading.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812
