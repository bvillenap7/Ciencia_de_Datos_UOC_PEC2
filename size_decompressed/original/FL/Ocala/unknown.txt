Unknown flying object circled home at high rate of speed creating a vacuum and making a high pitched whistling/whooshing sound.;1973-06-30 02:00:00;15-20 minutes;Unknown flying object circled home at high rate of speed creating a vacuum and making a high pitched whistling/whooshing sound. My father is a Registered Nurse, my mother is a Licensed Practical Nurse and my grandmother is a homemaker.   When I was a teenager, my mother told me of an event that happened to all three of them in 1973.  I was only 4 years old when this happened and did not witness it myself although I was present for the event. It started at my grandmothersâ€™ home which was just a quarter mile NW of ours.  My family owned a 90 acre ranch in the NW section of the county and both homes were on the same property.  My grandparents and my dad had lived on the property for about 13 years and my mother and I had just moved to the property after she married my dad.  Most of the property was cleared but we were surrounded by a thick forest. At around 2 am one morning my grandmother got up to use the bathroom and as she was going back to bed she saw a very bright light outside her bedroom window facing east toward the front of the house, the bedroom was in the southeast corner of the home.  She didn't know what it was so she went to her kitchen window also facing east to get a better look. She described an intense light hovering above the ground at the tree tops and moving toward her house from the east.  She said it was very bright and lit everything up like daylight and she said there was a high pitched whistling/whooshing sound that was so loud she had to cover her ears.  She watched as the light moved up and over her house to the west when it suddenly disappeared.  The light and the sound were just suddenly gone and she did not see it anywhere in the sky when she walked outside to look for it.  My grandfather never woke up and has no recall of the event. At about the same time my parents were awakened by a high pitched whistling/whooshing sound and the whole house shaking violently.  My mother said the house was shaking so bad that the mirrors on her closet doors were rattling violently and she thought they were going to break.  She said the sound was incredibly loud and she and my dad had to cover their ears and shout to each other to be heard.  They made their way to my room and found me sleeping soundly as though nothing was going on.  They could not see an object but said it was circling the house incredibly fast and making that horribly loud sound. They said after a few minutes the atmosphere changed and it became very difficult for them to breathe and they felt like they were in a vacuum. They said all of this lasted about 10 to 15 minutes when suddenly everything stopped.  The sound, the vacuum and the violent shaking just stopped as though it had never happened.  They told me that neither of them was able to get back to sleep that night and they never knew what it was that had caused all of the ruckus.  I have no recall of anything related to this event and I never experienced anything like it in all the years that I lived there and my parents never had another experience after this one. I don't believe in little green men, aliens or extraterrestrial beings but I know something happened that night I just don't know what caused it to happen.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812

Multiple lights hovering in the sky.;2014-12-13 19:15:00;5-10 minutes;Multiple lights hovering in the sky. My husband and I were pulling out of our driveway and saw a light in the sky just above the trees. as we started to travel towards the light, we saw 3 more.  There is a hill on our road and by the time we crested the hill, there were more than ten lights almost in a multiple connected triangle formation.   I would say that there were more than 10 of them and they were a yellowish orange color with a haze around them.  They almost seemed to hover and slowly drift. In the time that it took to travel 2 blocks, they disappeared 2 at a time.   I tried to get pictures and/or video with my cell phone but every time that I would get the camera open and focused, my screen would go black and back to my main screen.   I called my mom who was not home because she had received a call from my sister and had gone to see the lights herself.  All of us in different locations saw the same thing, my sister got pictures and video.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812
Silver polygon shaped ufo chasing jet;2015-01-31 11:00:00;Unknown;Silver polygon shaped ufo chasing jet I was driving from Ocala to Gainesville, on Highway 441.  On the way, it is usually lonely.   I was driving as I looked up at the sky in from of me, I notice a lot of jet smoke streaks in the sky.  I actually saw 2 or 3 jets flying leaving smoke streaks.   As I looked left through the driver side window, I see another jet leaving a smoke streak.  However, there is an odd polygon shaped craft flying above the jet behind it above the smoke streak.  This craft was moving as fast as the jet keeping up with it and not leaving a smoke streak behind it at all.   If it wasn't because of the traffic, I would have got off road and recorded it was odd and I was just in shock.  It was my second ufo sighting ever.   The craft was silverish grey and it was reflecting the Sun's light.  It seemed to have like a dark haze around it.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812
