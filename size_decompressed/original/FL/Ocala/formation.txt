She directs my attention to an unusual formation or constellation of stars. I looked up in the direction which was north on my compass. There were about 9 stars very far away appearing to be like distant stars but they were in a perfect line. Then we realized they were moving. Almost too fast to be normal. A plane doesn’t travel across sky that far at that speed. They also were moving out of site they were flying over head and the sky was perfectly clear so it’s unexplainable how they were flying out of view unless they were flying further in trajectory. Nighttime flights can’t be in a straight line which also makes me wonder if this was one object that was Massive.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812
