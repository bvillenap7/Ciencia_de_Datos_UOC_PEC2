A bright blue ring of light swooping in and vanishing with a trail of blue left behind;2001-08-02 23:00:00;2 seconds;A bright blue ring of light swooping in and vanishing with a trail of blue left behind I was walking out the door of a friends house. For some reason, I looked up. I was walking south. Looking up at about a 60 degree angle...I saw a blue circular light swoop in towards the north and it seemed to be descending then it suddenly vanished. No sound. The color of the blue was almost a turqoise blue. Ever see those circular fluroscent kitchen lights for the ceiling light? thats what it looked like, a blue ring with darkness in the middle. And it had an amazing blue trail behind it which seemed to linger more than it should, even after it vanished. I walked back in and told my friends what i just saw...and they brushed it off. I wasnt drinking at all that nite.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812
a bunch of beaming lights flying at top speed 50 ft about the ground;2008-01-30 20:00:00;30 seconds;a bunch of beaming lights flying at top speed 50 ft about the ground Me and my freind was walkin to a gas station, and on the way we saw a plane. As the aircraft got closer it sounded real loud and was flying about 50 ft above us. We guessed it would be a jet, but didnt look anything like one. It was moving fast and had a bunch of beaming lights onit, you could see the beam of lights on all the clouds. It soon vanished, maybe into the clouds, i have no idea, but this was an amazing experience.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812

It had red and green lights flashing or pulsating around really fast in a circular motion. The object didnt move and stayed in the same spot for an hour.  Other fast lights started coming out of the objet and zipping around back and forth.  We recorded it with our cell phone. After that we went inside to google what we were seeing or to see if anyone else was reporting seeing the same thing and then went back outside only to find the object had dissapeared.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812

White dots over Ocala, Fl.;2012-02-01 19:30:00;1 min;White dots over Ocala, Fl. While driving, I saw 2 white dots close together.  At first, I thougth they were stars but, I stargaze every nite and knew they couldn't be,not in that area.  This lasted 10-20 seconds then they slowly faded out, like the way the ISS does.  The only thing I thought it could be was a supply ship close to the ISS before landing but, I checked the sighting opportunities and there wasn't one at that time.  I should of stopped.  Don't know if they were moving or not.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812

Bright white round light in south Ocala night sky,remained stationary and quickly faded out only to reappear again.;2018-07-17 21:00:00;5-10 minues;Bright white round light in south Ocala night sky,remained stationary and quickly faded out only to reappear again. While sitting on the back porch looking at the night sky I noticed a very bright white round object In the sky.  It wasn’t high enough to be a star or planet.  I intently studied its position in the sky and it remained stationary.   After a few minutes, the light quickly became small and disappeared from sight only to appear again about 2 minutes later in the same location.  It did that a few mores times and then quickly disappeared for good.   I took pictures and they show a round circular object that had an outside ring with a circular object inside of it.  The photo also showed round white orbs in the lower corner which I don’t recall even seeing at the time.  ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) You are right about it being Venus. I took a picture tonight of Venus in western sky and it had the same ring affect in picture. Thank You for your explanation.  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812

As I turned my vehicle to go left (west), it appeared to have a long orange trail behind it. I was driving but my 7 year old said it looked like a large fire coming out behind a large circular object. We thought it may have been a rocket or a meteor, but it appeared to be traveling at a high rate of speed, then it disappeared.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812
