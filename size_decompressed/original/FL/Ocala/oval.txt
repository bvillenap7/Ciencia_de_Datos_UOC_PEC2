I was outside and noticed a plane flying south and then noticed there was an object coming north that seemed to be headed for the same path. The plane then turned off the path.   The object was a bright light flickering at times and white and green.  It was probably about two times the size of the brightest star I have seen.  It flickered like a sparkler does.  I ran into the house and called my daughter and wife out to observe, and it was still there.  The object was very slowly traveling north in a random zig zag pattern and at times appeared to be hanging in the sky.  During the time I watched, the object seemed to drop something.  It was like bits of red fire.  After about a minute or two it had a speed burst and then was totally gone.   I have never seen anything like this in my 47 years.  I still have no clue as to what it was, but I know it was nothing I have seen before.;29.1066473354231;-82.1606326018812
