Wingless aircraft like 3 missles linked together;2006-09-22 15:10:00;5 minutes;wingless aircraft like 3 missles linked together I observed a bright silver aircraft with binoculars for aproximately 5 minutes.  This craft looked like 3 long range missiles linked together.  If you were to place 3 toothpicks together on a table with the center one slightly foward you would see a pretty good discription of what I saw.   I extimate the speed to be faster than a commercial jetliner and mayble a little faster than a fighter jet.  I did not get the feeling it was alien, but there was no contrail.   Has anyone else seen this craft?;26.435248;-81.8104720000001
