military jets trying to intercept egg shaped matalic object;2006-02-16 14:00:00;20 seconds;military jets trying to intercept egg shaped matalic object Observed an egg shaped matalic object moving slowly across sky at an estimated 3000 feet high heading east to west. Would have probably dismissed what I saw except less than 10 seconds elapsed when two fighter jets came over flying fast as if to intercept the object, on the same path as the egg shaped object.  I have lived in this area of Florida for six years and these are the first two military jets I have observed in this area.;26.435248;-81.8104720000001
