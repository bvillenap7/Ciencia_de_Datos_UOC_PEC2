Thirty to forty red orbs Estero, Florida.;2015-03-10 21:45:00;10 minutes;Thirty to forty red orbs Estero, Florida. Was driving down Estero Parkway and noticed a circular red orb by the moon. For some reason I thought it was Mars, but it was too big and moving.   Then out of nowhere about thirty to forty red orbs appeared out of nowhere and weren't traveling fast and heading north.  They stayed light for about a minute then blinked out and would see several appear and disappear intermittently.   I left cell phone at the house otherwise I would've taped them.  I served in the military and they weren't planes and thought maybe they were some kinda light balloon, but were far to big to be so.;26.435248;-81.8104720000001
Circular formation of 3-5 lights, slowly flickering and intermittently changing color and number of flickering lights.;2018-07-13 01:47:00;40 minutes;Circular formation of 3-5 lights, slowly flickering and intermittently changing color and number of flickering lights. One circle comprised of 4-5 lights.  Stationary.  Initial faint object(s) caught my eye due to faint flicker.  After staring for a few minutes, and writing off as a plane (even though it was 1:45 am), flicker became slightly more clear.  Object remained stationary, but flickering colors began to change after a few minutes. white...then red...then green...then blue.  Was sometimes three lights flickering, some were four, some flickers contained five.  It was a slower flicker, and again, location of circle of lights never moved position.  I watched for close to 45 min, then went back inside.  Came out again 20 min later, and dark sky had three long vertical grayish clouds (easily 20-30 size of footprint of original circle).  Object was gone.;26.435248;-81.8104720000001
