Light hovered above us.  Returning to the bridge in the opposite direction 15-20 minutes later saw same bright white light moving and then dim its light briefly and stopping mid air again. Went to beach to eat ice cream and getting out of the car being especially aware of the sky saw multiple brighter than star lights hovering overhead, one in particular more bright and closer than any other.  After 10 mins or so heard a noise from behind and saw a boomerang shaped triangle shadowed by three circular lights.  Turning around we wittnessed a swarm of these objects very close to the ground too large to be flying as close together as they were to be planes. The swarm of these objects were what was in the farther distance 10 minutes prior to incident.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
Triangle shaped object in sky.;2012-08-01 00:00:00;5-7 minutes;Triangle shaped object in sky My husband and I just made to my friends house and put our bags inside, we automaticallly decided to go for a walk.  It's dark there and we can acutally view the stars.  He said Whoa to which I thought I missed a shooting star. He grabs my shoulders and physically stops me.  I knew to look up. It sent fear through my body to know this was Not a shooting star. What we saw was a trianglular shape craft, it had one light at each end and was traveling from West to North.  Right over us, silently gliding through the air at what I'd like to think was a low altitude. Or maybe it was bigger than I can imagine. I've seen jumbo jets up close in the air.  This would be a toothpick compared to what we saw.  It was so big it was blocking out stars as it moved.  I've seen horror movies. Anything you can think of that would be scary But Nothing in this world has given me the feeling I had felt that night.  My husband points at it and says what is that? I pull his arm down and beg him to not do that. In that moment, we felt as if sensed us. Then it diapppeared. We dont know if it cloaked itself, or was so fast I couldn't catch it. We didnt take our eyes off of it until we couldnt see it anymore.  Details of the craft: triangle shaped, 3 lights, completely silent, I want to say the size was of a small city. When it passed over us I could see a circular shape in the very middle. maybe a door?  I know it soulnds crazy, but i Know what I saw and felt.

V shaped, transparent.  Lights on it looked like it was a small cluster of dimmed starts in a v shape.  We had Clear star sky.  Heading west to east towards Atlantic Ocean.  Only saw the shape/outline of the craft because it was reflecting off the ground lights.  Thats how I figured out it was in a v shape. I was in disbelief. Thats why I'm here looking for more witnesses;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
