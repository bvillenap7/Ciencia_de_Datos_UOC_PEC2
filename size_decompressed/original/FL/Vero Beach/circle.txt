GROUPING OF AMBER COLORED ROUND LIGHTS ALL IN A HORIZONTAL POSITION, SAME LEVEL;2006-05-06 22:10:00;00:30;GROUPING OF AMBER COLORED ROUND LIGHTS ALL IN A HORIZONTAL POSITION, SAME LEVEL ON SATURDAY NIGHT 05/06/06, AT APPROXMATELY 10:10 PM I WAS HEADED TO WORK.  I LIVE IN A RURAL PART OF INDIAN RIVER COUNTY IN FLORDIA.  OUR COUNTY IS FAMOUS FOR GRAPEFRUIT AND OTHER CITRUS.  I LIVE IN THE MIDDLE OF A GROVE AREA.  THE NEAREST HOME TO MINE IS APPROXIMATELY 2 MILES AWAY.  THIS AREA IS SECLUDED EXCEPT FOR THE OCCASIONAL GROVE BARN.  SOME OF THE BARNS DO HAVE AMBER COLORED STREET LIGHTS SUPPLIED BY FLORIDA POWER AND LIGHT.  AS I WAS DRIVING ON 122ND AVE NORTH TO S R 60 IN VERO BEACH, FL.  I LOOKED TO THE WEST.  I OBSERVED THE CELL TOWER WHICH IS LOCATED 3 MILES TO MY WEST ON 154TH AVE.  WHAT I SAW IN THE VICINITY OF THE CELL TOWER WAS A GROUP OF 4 ROUND AMBER COLORED LIGHTS VERY BRIGHT AND AT ABOUT THE SAME HEIGHT AS THE CELL TOWER. I HAVE LIVED IN THIS AREA ABOUT 3 YEARS NOW AND I KNOW THE LOCATION OF EVERY STREET LIGHT AT THE OCCASIONAL GROVE BARN THAT I DESCRIBED EARLIER. I STOPPED FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT AND WHERE THESE LIGHTS WOULD BE COMING FROM.  AFTER THAT TIME, I NOTICED A FIFTH LIGHT JOIN THE GROUP OF FOUR LIGHTS.  AGAIN I DID NOT SEE A CRAFT ONLY FIVE BRIGHT LIGHTS RESEMBLING THE SIZE AND SHAPE AND COLOR OF AN  AMBER STREET LIGHT.  BUT NOW THERE WHERE FIVE LIGHTS WHERE SECONDS AGO THERE HAD ONLY BEEN FOUR.  I CALLED MY CO WORKER WHO WAS WAITING TO BE RELIEVED BY ME AT 11 PM.  I TOLD HIM WHAT I SAW AND SAID THAT I WOULD BE IN TO WORK ON TIME BUT WANTED TO TAKE 15 MINUTES TO DRIVE TO THE AREA OF 154TH AVE WHERE I SAW THESE STRANGE LIGHTS.  I WANTED TO SEE IF POSSIBLY THERE WHERE NEW STREET LIGHTS INSTALLED OR SOME EXPLANATION TO WHAT I WAS SEEING.  AS I TURNED MY PICK UP AROUND ON THE DIRT ROAD AND STARTED TO HEAD WEST THE GROUP OF LIGHTS DISAPPEARED. I WAS DISAPPOINTED BUT STILL DECIDED TO HEAD WEST TOWARD 154TH AVE JUST TO SEE IF I COULD SEE WHAT THESE LIGHTS COULD HAVE BEEN.  HEADING WEST SUDDENLY THE LIGHTS APPEARED AGAIN.  BUT THIS TIME THERE WHERE 6 AMBER COLORED LIGHTS ALL IN A ROW AT THE SAME HEIGHT FURTHER WEST AND SOUTH OF WHERE I HAD FIRST SEEN THE GROUPING OF LIGHTS.  I STOPPED MY VEHICLE AND OBSERVED THE LIGHTS FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT.  THERE WAS A GROUP OF SIX AMBER COLORED LIGHTS ALL IN A ROW AT THE SAME HEIGHT.   SUDDENLY ONE BY ONE THE LIGHTS STARTED TO DISAPPEAR AGAIN. I LOOKED TO THE NORTH AND SAW A SMALL PLANE FLYING TOWARD THE SOUTH PASSING IN FRONT OF WHERE THE GROUPING HAD BEEN.  THE PLANE WAS READILY RECOGNIZED FROM THE STRONG HEAD LIGHT AND BLINKING RED TAIL LIGHTS.  THE PLANE SORT OF ZIGGED IN THE SKY AND I WONDERED IF THE PILOT HAD SEEN THE SAME LIGHTS THAT I HAD.  THE PLANE CONTINUED SOUTH.  WITHIN FIVE MINUTES OF THE PLANE PASSING, THE GROUP OF SIX AMBER COLORED ROUND LIGHTS SUDDENLY APPEARED. I CONTINUED TO WATCH THEM AND ANOTHER PICK UP TRUCK WENT BY MY AREA.  I WAS ABLE TO STOP THE DRIVER INTRODUCE MYSELF AND HAVE HIM SEE THE LIGHTS.  BUT NOW THERE WHERE ONLY THREE LIGHTS AND THE OTHER WITNESS CONCLUDED THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THOSE LIGHTS BEFORE.  WE BOTH WATCHED THE LIGHTS FOR APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES AND THEN SUDDENLY ONE BY ONE THEY ALL VANISHED JUST AS QUICKLY AS IF SOMEONE HAD TURNED OFF A SWITCH.  I OBSERVED THE LIGHTS FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES.  I HAD KEPT MY COWORKER ON THE PHONE THE ENTIRE TIME AND OUR CONVERSATION WAS RECORDED SINCE THE JOB I HAVE USES RECORDED PHONE LINES.  I STAYED IN THE AREA ANOTHER 10 MINUTES BUT THE LIGHTS DID NOT APPEAR AGAIN.  THE AREA WHERE THE LIGHTS APPEARED WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER A GROVE OR RANGELAND OR THE LARGE ST JOHN'S MARSH RESEVOIR.  THIS AREA WOULD NOT HAVE ANY LIGHTING FROM THE GROUND THAT I COULD EXPLAIN.  THE ROUND LIGHTS WHERE IN THE WESTERN HORIZON AT ABOUT 8 O'CLOCK IN THE SKY.  THE SIGHTING WAS TO ME SOMEWHERE BETWEEN WESTERN INDIAN RIVER COUNTY AND YEEHAW JUNCTION WHICH IS ABOUT 20 MILES WEST OF MY LOCATION.  THE GROUP OF LIGHTS ALL WHERE ROUND AND AMBER COLORED.  THERE WHERE SIX IN A ROW AT ONE TIME BUT I HAD SEEN A GROUP OF FOUR AND FIVE.  THESE I WOULD SAY WHERE ALL THE SAME GROUP BUT THE NUMBER OF LIGHTS DID CHANGE IN THE GROUPING.  THE LIGHTS WHERE ALWAYS AT THE SAME LEVEL. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE LIGHTS STAYED FIXED IN ONE SPOT UNTIL DISAPPEARING.  THE LIGHTS DID NOT TRAVEL OR DO MANUVEURS IN THE SKY.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
Erratic object, looked similar to a star, never moved more than 10 - 20 degrees during my entire 35 minute viewing period.;2010-09-19 00:05:00;00:40;Erratic object, looked similar to a star, never moved more than 10 - 20 degrees during my entire 35 minute viewing period. On September 20, 2010, about 0005 AM, I went out on our lanai to get the cat in for the evening.  The moon was 3 days before full-moon, the skies were clear and I looked up at the stars.  A single unidentified object was seen moving in an erratic fashion to the Northwest of Vero Beach, FL.  It was about the size and color of a bright star, but I could not determine the distance or actual size of the object.  It is unknown what produced the light of this object (whether it was light, the propulsive portion of the object, or if it was a reflection from the light of the moon). My gaze was at an elevation of 30-35 degrees, so it was easy to observe without straining my neck.  I would estimate it was over central Florida, in the direction of Kissimmee/Orlando but it could have been closer or farther away.   For almost 35 minutes, I watched this object.  At times it appeared to be stationary although it might have been moving directly toward or away from me.  Movement consisted of circles (sometimes clockwise, other times counter clockwise).  It also moved in a straight line at times and sometimes moved with a sudden forward motion, then slowing, then pulsing forward again.  The movements I observed were more suggestive of how a boat might move in the water, rather than any kind of plane, helicopter, or other aircraft.  It was also able to move in one direction, stop briefly, and then move at an angle varying from 20-270 degrees. What was particularly interesting was that this object never moved any further than about 10 to 20 degrees in the sky from the area where I first observed it.  It remained in that area until I left with the cat for the evening, at about 0040 AM. There were no other observers with me during this time. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.  The sighting occurred on Sunday, September 19, 2010.  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be an exceptional witness.  PD));27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
Glowing Red Orb;2014-04-04 10:53:00;5+ minutes;Glowing Red Orb It was about 10:50pm on 4/4/14 when I turned off the TV and was thinking about work when something caught my attention out of the corner of my eye to the right.   I looked up toward the large window over the living room windows and saw what appeared to be a fire ball.   I got up and went to the windows.  It was traveling South to North, heading towards my location at a steady speed.  It was not windy out. 	It was a glowing red circle or orb, it did not emit smoke, it did not leave a tail.  I just stood watching it come closer and closer and was mesmerized by what it was so much so that I didn’t want to stop watching it to get my cell to take a video.  It made no sound.   It was approx. one story above the one story houses.  At it’s closest point to me, approx. 30 feet from me, it appeared to be between the size of a basket ball to a 3 foot circle which means it would have been larger in person.   It went between my house and the neighbors house at a steady speed.  I ran to the North side of the house and watched it continue North, it had already appeared on the North side of the houses and was traveling faster than I ran.   I did not feel threatened by this object at this point in time.  It appeared to be a red swirling ball of glowing gaseous liquid, but it was traveling at a constant speed and at a constant distance above the earth.  It appeared to be searching for something, ! or perhaps observing stuff.  I watched it disappear out of sight. 	I was hoping to see others, so I grabbed my phone, used the bathroom, and turned off the house alarm so I could go outside if I saw another one.  I went back and forth from the North to the South sides of the house looking out the windows to see if there were others.  Then at about 11:03 pm, I saw what appeared to be the same red glowing orb traveling from the North back South along the same exact path.  I activated my cell phone video but it’s shaky and the object appeared so small on the video compared to what I saw with my eyes.  All of a sudden I got an eery feeling because it seemed to be coming right at me and slowing down.  I decided to go outside to see it I could get a better video of it.  At this point, I am concerned as to not only what it is, buy why is it heading back toward me? As I walk outside and hold my cell up the object started traveling North away from me again.  At this point I am spooked.  I didn’t want to go outside, but feeling no threat and hearing! no sound from the object I thought I could just get a video of it as it went over me.  However, as I hold up my cell phone, the object starts rapidly traveling North again. 	I feel that it saw me and didn’t want to be taped.  The second video does not even show the object, despite my eyes seeing it.  During this time, there were no small planes in the area, but after watching it disappear out of sight the second time, I saw a small plane in the distance by the Vero Beach Airport.  I saw planes over the house earlier in the evening, they never fly that low, and I can always hear them. 	I have 2 videos and have taken still pictures from the first video.  When enlarging the still pictures, one of them looks like a face, and one of them looks like a swirly thing that could propel something if it weren’t in a gaseous bubble? I wish to remain anonymous due to my being a professional person who deals with the public in this area and area South of here.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
Bright yellow orange glowing circular object observed for aprroximately 5 minutes.;2014-09-20 01:55:00;5 minutes;Bright yellow orange glowing circular object observed for aprroximately 5 minutes. It was about 01:55am and I was driving from Vero Beach, FL, toward West Melbourne, FL on U.S.1. I was about 14 or 15 miles south of West Melbourne (approximately 25 miles north of Vero Beach) heading North on U.S.1 along the coast when I observed a round, bright yellowish orange light.  At first I thought it might be the moon, but, I quickly realized that it was too small and too bright.  This light was unusual as it gave the effect similar to what you would see watching a safety flare or a piece of magnesium burn - very bright & glowing. The next thing I noticed was that it was too big to be a star. I also noticed that it was moving from North to South down the coastline, but over the ocean - in my general direction, but not directly at me.  It didn't seem to be moving incredibly fast but I would say it was moving at a moderate pace, it was slightly off to my right - but in front of me, again - yellowish orange & very bright - too small to be the moon & too big to be a star, so now I am thinking to myself - this has to be a meteor.  With my curiosity peaked, I actually parked in the median of U.S.1 and got out of my car and observed this Thing for about 5 minutes.  Now I have my cell phone out and I am gonna try and get some video of it. I had a little trouble finding it at first, I am guessing at it's closest point, it was probably 1-2 miles from me and if I had to guess an altitiude, I would say somewhere between 3,000 & 5,000 ft.  There was no audible noise associated with this object or it's! movement.  Once I finally did get it into view and was ready to record it, it suddenly burned extra bright - and then disappeared - just like that. Or, so I thought. Upon looking closely for about 10 seconds I picked it up again but the bright yellowish orange glow that was there previously, was now gone.  There was still some light there still, but it was very dim (to the point where it could have easily been overlooked) and appeared to be coming from behind the object now, thus silhouetting it.  So, I surmised that it had simply changed direction, I am guessing it had made, approximately, an abrupt 90 degree turn.   Now the object was still moving but appeared to be heading away from me - but still remained in the same general location with a little lateral movement back & forth. I understand that this object changed direction abruptly, but, I can't explain the dramatic decrease in the light it was emitting, it went from super-bright, to virtually no light at all.  And again, there was no noise that I could associate this object.  I watched it for a couple minutes longer, as it seemed to be moving away from me (East) o! ut over the open ocean and then I decided to leave as I was meeting somebody. I have never in my life (45 years) seen a UFO - but I believe, for the first time, I did last night.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
UFO sighting in Vero Beach, Florida.;2015-06-18 20:30:00;3 minutes;UFO sighting in Vero Beach, Florida. A bright orange light appeared in the night sky over the Atlantic Ocean.  We were sitting outside at a restaurant on the beach and pointed it out to our waiter.  He had no idea what it was.  It flashed orange kinda like fire.  It was round, bright and very obvious.   It hovered above the ocean for about 3 or 4 minutes, and then just disappeared in a second. It did not reappear.   We used a star map app to see if something would be there, and nothing in the night sky came up. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

What I thought was a meteor might have been something else.;2016-08-19 00:53:00;2:24;What I thought was a meteor might have been something else. I was on the back porch of my house, three houses from the beach.  Being a pilot, I looked up at the sky and saw a circular object, which at first I thought was a meteor because of its bright light and tail dragging behind.   I took my phone from my pocket and started to film.  The object moved from northeast to northwest and descended, initially it was traveling at very high velocity and seemed to decelerate extremely fast.  Kept my cell phone camera on it as long as I could, until it disapeared.   There were no strobe lights or anti-collision lights on it.   It was bright red, and turned to yellowish, as it advanced. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite eloquent and sober-minded.  He describes himself as an aircraft owner, a commercial pilot and a flight instructor.  PD));27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
