Shooting star without red globe burn-out or descent maintains steady Southerly trajectory.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch??  PD));2007-10-10 20:55:00;30 seconds;Shooting star without red globe burn-out or descent maintains steady Southerly trajectory Shooting star-like light moves over Eastern sky from North to South - had triangular or V-shaped wake that got brighter before suddenly disappearing.   However, unlike a shooting star, the red globe of visible light did not descend, but rather maintained steady speed and altitude.  Red globe did not fade out and fall as other shooting stars I've seen in the Florida night sky have.   Several people blurted out What is that?  It was very much like a shooting star - yet it maintained its Southerly trajectory, its red globe brightness, its altitude and its speed.   Although there were many eye-witnesses I see no report of the event in any local publication or broadcast - thus no reasonable explanation for the event. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that a missile was launched from Cape Canaveral on this date.  PD));27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
