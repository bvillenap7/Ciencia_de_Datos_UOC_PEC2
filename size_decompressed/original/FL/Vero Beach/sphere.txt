Lone flaming orb shoots back and forth across the sky;2012-12-24 18:15:00;1 1/2 minutes;Lone flaming orb shoots back and forth across the sky There was a bright flaming round sphere shaped object in the southeast sky at about 6:15 pm with no other stars in the sky.  The flames appeared to be coming from the top of it.   It appeared to be moving slowing towards the north when suddenly it accelerated to the north going about a 1/3 across the sky, then suddenly stopped and reversed its direction and returned to the south to the exact same spot I had first seen it.  The flames then slowly went out and the now glowing sphere moved rapidly upwards into the sky and disappeared.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
Saw a formation of approx. 2 doz. reddish/ orange glowing spherical objects float cross from the ocean side (east) to west across Hwy;2016-11-25 20:00:00;30 minutes;Saw a formation of approx. 2 doz. reddish/ orange glowing spherical objects float cross from the ocean side (east) to west across Hwy At 8pm on Fri. was on cell phone with a girlfriend sitting in a parking lot outside my condo on north AIA in Vero Beach, Fl, and observed  a reddish/ orange glowing roundish light coming from the ocean direction.  It was quite high, so thought it was an airplane's headlights about to land at the nearby airport.  But oddly, the object didn't seem to turn, it seemed to float across the sky from east toward the west crossing over Hwy AiA.   Within seconds saw another identical object on the same path.  Within the next 20 to 30 minutes, objects greatly increased in number with same glow and were really close to each other.  It looked like floating Chinese lanterns, and within the next 20 minutes, as many as 2 dozen of these glowing objects had passed over A1A appearing to make a really wide circle in the sky. Informed my friend of this usual phenomenon as we continued to chat.  Because I was speaking to her, it never occurred to me to video it with my cell phone.  Rather, I passed it off as some type of local celebration...i.e.  A Chinese celebration?...of which I was unaware. I spoke about 30 minutes with my friend, all the while these objects were floating by.  Not a single neighbor came into the parking lot for me to point this oddity out to them. I did see several cars pass my building on Hwy A1A and pointed to the sky, but none stopped to look. Upon entering my apt, I googled for information about this light show but as of now, haven't read anything that explains their presence.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
