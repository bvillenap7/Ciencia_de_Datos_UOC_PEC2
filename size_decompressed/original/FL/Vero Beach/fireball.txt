2 amber  burning objects seen off the coast of Vero Beach;2009-12-21 21:30:00;5 minutes;2 amber  burning objects seen off the coast of Vero Beach We are local residents that were born and raised in the area and have never seen or heard of anything like this.  We saw 2 objects around 9:30pm over the ocean.  At first we thought they were boats way off in the horizon but after closer inspection realized they were way above the horizon and seemed to have a firey glow, amber color tent and were pretty much stationary.  After a couple of minutes one burned out and the second soon to follow. We didnt see anything after that.  There was no sound no color change no beams...  Just an amber burning object that seems to have smoke rising like a flare.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
Two very bright orange lights hovering and then flying over Florida coast.;2013-11-01 20:15:00;5 minutes;Two very bright orange lights hovering and then flying over Florida coast. We were on a boardwalk in vero, that we walk nightly, when I looked out toward to ocean because I like to see passing cruise ships.  Well when I looked out toward the sea I saw 2 very strange orange lights. I come here often and it was like nothing I or my boyfriend had ever seen.   At first I thought it was a flare, but it seemed to not be moving for some time (maybe 3 minutes) and then I thought it might be a ship on fire because that was the only thing that made sense and also because there seemed to be a haze around the lights... but the two orange fire looking balls never combined like a fire would.   Then we notice they had gotten closer and were moving south and they were not in the water at all but floating about 50 feet above the water and horizon, moving faster than I have ever seen anything move.  They were defiantly two different things, but flying very close to each other. It was like something I have never seen before, and my boyfriend too.  There was no white, green or red light like typical aircraft.    As it got faster and closer one flickered and just disappeared and the next orb followed suit within 3-4 seconds and that was it.  No more lights or no more remnants of such an object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
Fireball in the night sky.;2013-11-17 22:02:00;4 minutes;Fireball in the night sky. At 10:02 pm, my best friend and father walked outside to go have a cigarette.  As soon as we got outside my best friend said what the hell is that?!  I looked up into the sky, and there was this huge bright orange fireball looking orb.  It was flickering between red and orange.  I live right next to the boardwalk off the ocean, it was headed in a full westward movement.  On the bottom of this orb, look like a white dome (like a half circle) it was a couple hundred feet in the air.  And quite big. For the first minute or two it was headed steadily westward.  And a pretty quick pace.  Then out of no where it looked like it stopped and hovered.  As it did the bottom white dome was no longer visible.  Then they moved faster and headed north.  And within less than a minute is had completely disappeared.   My father is very big into space, as we have family that works for NASA and he is quite knowledgeable.  And he personally said he has never in his life seen anything like this..  I recorded a video of it on my iPhone, but it was quite crappy clarity since it was so dark out...  Called WPTV  they asked us to send the video in.   So we shall see if anything arises from this.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
Fireball in the night sky;2013-12-24 23:35:00;20 seconds;Fireball in the night sky Driving home from a Christmas Eve dinner, we were heading east when I saw what looked like an orange ball in the sky.  Not very high above the tree line.  (I joking said, look its Santa!) It was moving from the north to the south.  I pointed it out to my husband and he also acknowledged this curious ball of fire.  As I watched it cross almost over head, it actually looked like a ball of fire with a halo affect partly around the front of it.  As it passed to my right I closely watched it and it began the dim then brighten back up every few seconds.  This lasted only about 20 seconds then it blinked out and it was gone.  This was at around 11:35 PM tonight.  It's dark out, it might have disappeared from sight because of trees but it didn't look that way to me.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905

A large orange object emitting a metallic, sparkling contrai, totally unique and different than any object previously experienced.;2014-02-20 19:50:00;3-4 minutes;A large orange object emitting a metallic, sparkling contrai, totally unique and different than any object previously experienced. Somewhere between 9 to 10:30 PM, I spotted a larger than normal round orange shape moving from North to South as I was getting ready for bed.  I looked up from my bed through a window and was immediately alerted that this is not a normal light.  It was much larger than any other lights in the sky.  I live near a small airport and there were many small aircraft in the sky, and I assume, some circling to land.  So the contrast was quite large between the planes with small normal colors lights and this much larger brilliant orange light.  My first impression was that it was a jet, perhaps on fire.  The reason I thought it was on fire was that this orange shiny object has an orange contrail coming out of the rear and streaming back behind it for some distance.  This contrail was also orange and it had a particular quality about it.  It was clearly visible against the night sky and it looked metallic and as it got closer it looked like the sparkle one would see from fireworks, although the contrail was not cascading like fireworks as it had a consistent stream coming out of the rear of the object.   Its speed was very slow, about the speed of a small aircraft as it approaches a landing.  It gave me a few minutes to watch it.  When my view started to become blocked from the roof line, I ran to our balcony to continue watching.  As it continued across the sky still moving from left to right, north to south, it gradually and smoothly turned to the east and moved away from me.  A very short time later it blinked out, disappeared suddenly.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
A single fireball traveling rather quickly from southeast to northwest where it disappeared into the clouds.;2015-01-11 21:00:00;90 seconds;A single fireball traveling rather quickly from southeast to northwest where it disappeared into the clouds. I was walking my dog at approximately 9:30 p.m. this evening.  I was talking to my neighbor on the phone.  I was walking east and saw a light in the sky.  The light looked orange, but  thought maybe it was just a plane and because of  the clouds appeared orange.  The closer it came, it appeared to be fire.   I told my neighbor to hurry and come outside and see what I was seeing.  I was scared for a moment, thinking it was a plane on fire about to crash.  When it went over us, it appeared to be a ball of flames.  I could actually see what appeared to be flames.  It was mostly orange, a lighter color of orange.  It is hard to determine the shape, but if I had to choose, I would say round.  The fireball traveled to the northwest fairly quickly.  I would say was traveling faster than I see most small planes travel, and seemed to just disappear.   The background was scattered clouds till heading towards the west where it became very cloudy.  I also heard no noise whatsoever.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
Large ball/orb with a tail.;2015-03-01 10:45:00;5 minutes;Large ball/orb with a tail. Huge reddish orb/ball of light got bigger and bigger as it got closer.   Then there was a big tail of flames.   At first we thought it might be an airplane catching fire or something, but it was too high.  The flames stopped and it seemed to disappear for a few seconds.   Then reappeared and just looked like a white star/comet continuing on it's pass further and further South East. We have video of it.   A strange guy came out of nowhere and told us that it was the space station switching directions.  I looked at the NASA site when I got home and the space station is on the other side of the world tonight.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
Fireball looking UFO hovered near us on beach;2016-08-19 00:55:00;10 minutes;Fireball looking UFO hovered near us on beach. My boyfriend and I honestly felt crazy,, and were not going to post anything, until we saw a startlingly similar sighting in our town, same area *the beach,* at nearly identical time, August 19th, around 12:50 am and on. We walked down to the beach and sat by the water, we are sitting now and see to our right (about 150 yards away) a white blinking light close to the ground, running uncomfortably fast towards us.  We had our dog, a Doberman, and assumed maybe it was a puppy with a blinking collar for night time.  Regardless, it freaked me out a bit an we ran back to our beach access (approximately 0.3 of a mile).  When we felt we were at the safety of our access and close to our home, we turned around and saw not just one blinking light, but now two.  Sprinting from the shore all the way to the top of the beach, back and forth at insane speed.  The blinking lights are going into the water-about 5 yards, and seem to have no trouble sprinting back and forth without stopping.  At this point, we realized their speed and how the second light came out of nowhere, it could not be dogs. At this point, I was very uneasy and told my boyfriend I would like to go home.  He insisted on watching and figuring it out.  When I told him again I was leaving, the two blinking lights shut off.  After 3-5 seconds of darkness, the lights come back on but now there are more, maybe 5 separate sources of these blinking lights, running quickly from the shore to the top of the beach. We turn around to go home and DIRECTLY in front of us, 100 yards AT MOST, and 3 stories high there is a bright orange/yellow LARGE light (looked like it could have been a plane) until it began rushing towards us and would change speed-when we turned around it was racing towards us but when we saw it, immediately slowed.  It was directly over us at a point and there was a white light in the middle of it reflecting down over us.  We looked where it originally seemed to be speeding from, and there WAS a small smoke trail.  We started screaming and ran back to the street.  We tried understanding what it was, but couldn't.  There was no start or end to the object-it was glowing, it had a glowing aura about it.It made no noise whatsoever.  It was right above us and we hard nothing. Neither of us were intoxicated and we consistently walk the beach at night as we live so close. We have never seen anything like this. When we were on the street, we looked back at the apartment building and could see the object hovering over the beach access where we left.  Literally just hovering.  As we were running home, it would go behind the building so we couldn't see it, but peek back out the same side. It did this 2-3 times and disappeared, not coming back out from the apartment building again. I'm not sure if these are unrelated experiences, but at the time it felt the blinking lights were distraction to turn around and have this terrifying, unidentified object so close to us....  IF anyone has any input, please let us know.  Neither of us can sleep at night.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
Bright orange fireball, Vero Beach, FL, 4-15-17 1:45 AM.;2017-07-15 01:45:00;45 seconds;Bright orange fireball Vero Beach, FL 4-15-17 1:45 AM At approximately 1:45 AM Eastern Time, I was walking my dog, and as usual, stargazing.  As I walked down 40th Ave., towards 12th Street in Vero Beach, Florida, I saw a large fireball appearing light falling to earth, at approximately 45 Degree angle, but curving, not coming straight down.  The ball of light lit the clouds orange, as it went behind the cloud and below the tree line, and out of sight.   There was no sound at all and I watched the area of the sky for another 10 minutes, but I saw nothing more.  It looked like the video of the Russian Chelyabinsk Meteor that came down in 2013, before the explosion and nowhere near as bright but the trajectory as this orange ball of fire was on a very similar angle.   I did not see a tail or trail behind it, and it appeared to move at a uniform speed, but slower than one would expect a meteor to fly.   This was amazing to watch, I hope I can find out more out about it.   I noticed my dog that is a wolf hybrid, seemed mesmerized, and watched it, as I did, until lost from our sight.  My dog just stood there and continued to stare in the direction we had seen the fireball fall behind the tree line for several minutes.  Direction when I first saw the fireball it was at about 94 degrees East and at about 45 degrees up with the flat horizon being 0 degrees (I do not know the proper term here), and I lost sight of it at about 104 degrees NE at a height of about 25 degrees.  It traveled that space in between 15 and 25 maybe 35 seconds.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
