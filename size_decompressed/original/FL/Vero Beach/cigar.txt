Two cigar shaped craft ( long white and thin) were playing leap frog with each other just above the horizon.  Sometimes they would go into the water.  They would be stationary for about 5 seconds then would disappear and instantly reappear about 10 degrees away from their original position.  It was a sunny day with many clouds and I was the only one who saw it on a sparsely populated public beach.  Then they just disappeared.  After they were gone there were about 6 -12 lenticular clouds in the same vicinity.  In about 5 minutes the lenticular clouds were gone.  It was very exciting.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
