Fast Bright white illuminated flying oval without wings;2019-09-17 07:30:00;1 minute;Fast Bright white illuminated flying oval without wings I was driving looking north on I75 looked out of my driveside window was looking at the moon it was one of those mornings that the moon is still In plain view.  I turned my head back to focus on the road when the thought hit my brain.  I just saw something flying by the moon.  I turned back to look at the moon the object looked like a plane without wings.  Bright white and it was moving very fast i looked at it for a few seconds wondering what i was seeing when I thought to get my phone i was able to take photos with my phone the object was so bright white id say it was illustrated or it was reflecting the sun but thats not the impression i got to me it look as white as the moon i was looking at.  The object flew from left  western horizon to east horizon in under a 30 seconds one more thing there was no condensation trail usually when i see a plane flying at high altitudes i see the con trail and it was a nice cool morning for Florida.
