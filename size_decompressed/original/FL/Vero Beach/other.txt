We did not here any engine sounds. An Orb shaped white object that we thought was a satelite moved across the sky from west to east.  Then it suddenly stopped directly above us.  Then it moved east very fast, then back above us then east very fast again. it did this for about 40 min before it got cloudy and we could not see it again.  It didn't flash any colors.  It almost looked like a star.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
Beautiful translucent-white jellyfish-like pattern with lights all over it traveling north to south along the shore at Vero Beach, FL;2020-10-17 19:45:00;8-10 seconds;Beautiful translucent-white jellyfish-like pattern with lights all over it traveling north to south along the shore at Vero Beach, FL Saturday evening, two friends and I were sitting on the beach in Vero Beach, FL. As it grew dark, there was just enough light to see the white foam of the waves crashing on the shore.  Suddenly, we all saw a very large translucent-white jellyfish-type object, flying north to south parallel to and close to the shore horizontally at an even speed, very low over the water. The “tentacles” of the “jellyfish” streaming behind it were uniform and looked as if they were made of lights. It cruised in front of us, clearly on a course, until it disappeared farther down the beach where the lights were a little brighter.  My impression is that it was like a stenciled white pattern moving through the air. We are not sure if it was ship or an organized intelligence. It was otherworldly and seemed to have a non-physical presence. We estimate it was traveling at about 30 mph, but we have difficulty nailing down dimensions or exactly how close it was to the shore and how high about the ocean it was. Maybe 50' long and 20' high? Maybe 20' from the shore and 20' above the water? Impossible to say.  But it was breathtaking and marvelous.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
Metal object in daylight sky very slow moving;2021-05-01 08:45:00;20 minutes;Metal object in daylight sky very slow moving I first saw it in the sky at about a 2 o'clock degree was silver like a star would be at night but this was daylight. It appeared to be at a high altitude a jet flew by and this object was higher. It started moving very slowly south which brought it to about 12 o'clock degree wise in the sky then to maybe 11 o'clock. This movement took maybe 15 minutes. The clouds were moving east to west. Then it turned back north and got to 2 o'clock but this time it took only about 5 minutes. Then it turned east at about the same speed as it did when heading north. I lost it in the sun after that. It was highly reflective metal because at times it would glint off the sun. It looked like it had angles more than soft curves. I took a couple pictures on my phone at 8X magnification but the image is pretty blurry;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
