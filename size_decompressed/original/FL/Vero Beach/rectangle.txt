Photographed light anomaly or object within low cloud formation.;2019-10-02 19:00:00;20 seconds;Photographed light anomaly or object within low cloud formation. I took (3) photographs of an interesting cloud in the evening, low to the ground, and the only cloud in the sky. Upon reviewing the photos the next morning, I noticed some very unusual light anomalies, and what appears to be an object within the cloud.  I did not see anything unusual with the naked eye when taking the pictures.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
