single bright amber colored light hovering over the ocean for a duration of time before disappearing;2009-08-01 21:30:00;5 minutes;single bright amber colored light hovering over the ocean for a duration of time before disappearing On a boardwalk on the beach at Jaycee park in Vero Beach Florida at 21:30 hours on august 1st a friend of mine and myself walked up to the boardwalk to take a look at the ocean with a few other night walkers crusing the path, when we noticed a substantially large amer colored single light out over the ocean, it was about 10 degrees above eye level and just kind of motionless , if it was moving it was moving extremely slow northward. But it was an amber colored light with  the radiant light beams coming off of it due to the salt in the air, I thought it may have been a plane or helicopter but it was borderline motionless and the light color was very strange and far off, a cloud went infront of it once and the light beams were still protruding through the cloud structure. We watched planes flying overhead while this was occuring, I dont know if they saw this but planes were present in the area and clearly much dimmer, and smaller than what was out over the oce! an. After about five minutes I decided to go run and get my camera to see what I could videot tape of this, and in less than a 2 minute time frame , while my friend Chris stayed to watch it, I returned and the light had just shut off is what Chris said, and we stayed for another 30 minutes and saw nothing. It was just gone.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905

Seven, large, bright lights spotted by two witnesses, above horizon, in Vero Beach, Florida;2011-03-19 21:30:00;1 minute;Seven, large, bright lights spotted by two witnesses, above horizon, in Vero Beach, Florida We had just returned from a party next door at 9:30 PM, when I proceeded to take my dogs out the back door to the fenced yard, which faces a conservation area to the south.   When I stepped outside I noticed 7 to 8 large round lights directly to the east, about a mile away, which would place them over the ocean.   I yelled for my husband to come and as he heard the urgency in my voice, he came to see what the commotion was all about, within 20 seconds.  He saw all seven lights with me and then we both saw them proceed to turn off, one-by-one.   He told me to grab the camera just inside the door, I was so mesmerized with the lights I didn't want to look away, they were very large, all of the same size and of a yellow/white light, no form was visible besides the lights.   They were at random in the sky, no special order or formation but pretty close to one another.  They were about 60 degrees above the horizon, totally still, not hovering, not making a sound.   They then proceeded to turn off, one at a time but with perfect synchrony.  I grabbed the camera as the next to last light turned off and started to film but the last light turned off.  Unfortunately, I got nothing.  This is one of the many phenomenas I have seen in Vero Beach in the last 35 years, yet this is the first sighting of this kind.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
Amber light moving westward over Vero Beach,  Florida.;2011-03-21 21:27:00;Approx 2 minutes;Amber light moving westward over Vero Beach,  Florida. Around 21:35 on 3/21/11, I went out as usual to walk my dog for the last time.  I often look at the stars, planes, etc.   This caught my eye right away.  It was a solid amber light to the south, far brighter than any aircraft light.  When I first noticed it, it was very bright and oval shaped, very far away and about halfway up into the sky.  It was moving at what appeared to be a slow rate straight across the sky towards the west from my location.  Although the rate seemed slow, it only lasted about 2 minutes from when I first saw it, and slowly faded away, giving the appearance it may have been moving very quickly due to its apparent distance away.  There were no sounds, no flashing lights, just solid amber.  I was in the Coast Guard and also fish in the ocean frequently at night.  I have NEVER even thought I saw anything resembling a UFO, but I can say without a doubt I have NEVER seen anything like this.   My gut reaction was to go get my wife to come loo! k at it, since I knew she would think I was crazy, but I was afraid if I did, I would miss something, or it would be gone.  Awesome experience!;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905

Yellow-orange light over Vero Beach.;2014-04-05 21:30:00;1-2 minutes;Yellow-orange light over Vero Beach. My boyfriend & I were on Ocean Drive in Vero Beach on Sat. 4/5/14 at about 9:30 pm.   We saw a yellow/orange light “gliding” from south to north in a straight line.  It was silent and had no typical red & white lights of  a normal airplane.  (Having been married to a pilot  for 30+ years, I am very familiar with what airplanes look like.)   It continued past us, then veered slightly to the northwest until we could no longer see it.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
2 lights seen over the ocean near Vero Beach;2018-08-04 22:30:00;4 minutes;2 lights seen over the ocean near Vero Beach While at ocean, saw a star suddenly move fast into a cloud, it did not blink.  Then a few minutes later we saw another star move from right to left and go fast into a different cloud.  The clouds left, then what appeared to be 2 meteors moving from right to left glowed brilliant white and became very large before disappearing.  There were strange pulses of light on the sky, no clouds around and different than heat lightening.   Then at 10:30 2 large lights turned on in front of us over the ocean under the triangle of stars where some of the other things were seen.  The lights blinked slowly on and off for a couple minutes, we tried to record them but they could not be recorded despite the brightness and size.  I had recorded Mars to the right, east southeast a few minutes prior and the lights were bigger and brighter.  My phone stopped recording, I tried several times to get a video.  After a couple minutes the lights turned on left one first then the right one, on and off for a couple more minutes.  The whole time there was no sound from them and they were stationary, they did not move, they stayed under the triangle of stars the whole time.  An airplane came from the north toward the lights and they disappeared.  The lights from the plane were smaller, blinking faster white and red. Suddenly there was another plane heading towards the area.  We stayed another fifteen minutes and then left. I thought the 2 lights were on an enormous craft.  Holding a ruler at arm's length, the lights were 20 inches apart.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
The two objects were stationary and flashing bright white.;2018-08-04 22:30:00;2-3 minutes;The two objects were stationary and flashing bright white. On first Saturday of August a female friend and her 11 year old son and I went to Jaycee Park on ocean in Vero Beach Florida.  It was 9 pm and raining.  At 9:15 it cleared up and we sat in beach chairs in the sand.  There were some clouds and the first thing we saw was a white object going S to N between two clouds and only visible for 2 seconds. At 10:20 the mother told her son to concentrate to try send a message.  The boy had previously seen lights at age 6 and 7.  One time they saw the  bright light which left at extreme speed near their house together.   At 10:30 two bright lights appeared and were flashing.  They were approximately 3 apart holding hand  out in front of face.  They were visible for 2 to 3 minutes, and when a plane light was encroaching, they went out.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905

I was driving and saw something strange in the sky.   ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch from Cape Canaveral.  PD));2021-04-23 06:00:00;5 minutes;I was driving and saw something strange in the sky pulled the car over immediately. It was shaped as a bullet at this point and time. I I seen a shooting star that was bright orange. I captured a picture of it. Was really excited.  a few minutes later I turn around and I see two SUPER bright lights behind the clouds. At first I thought it was the moon but I seen that there were two.  As the clouds moved away from the lights- I was alarmed. THere were two bright lights ( not planes) that were pulsating light rays downward to the ground every 5 or 6 seconds.  ( like a sonar) They were hovering at a slow speed towards the ocean. ( I was at the riverside dog park).  I am 30 years old and have never seen anything like this in my life. I was in a trance just looking at it . Speechless. They soon drifted slowly into the sky and vanished. I was stunned.;27.6355276243094;-80.4172723756905
