I saw it and confirmed several lights at the distance where vertically moving up towards outside our orbit, one right after the other one, we couldn't count but this took about 10 min and I don't know for sure how many lights but definitely more than 15. All of the sudden there were no more lights left they were all gone.;25.7331538461538;-80.2683307692308
