High, Fast-moving contrail of smoke;1999-04-03 16:30:00;2 Minutes;High, Fast-moving contrail of smoke While stuck in traffic on US1(Dixie Hwy), through the open top of my Jeep Wrangler I noticed a contrail in the sky. It was moving from E-SE to W-NW. Itried to see the source of this contrail, but it was too, too high to see. That's when I started to question it's origin. It was moving too fast for a plane that was that high(far away). At the next stop in traffic(app. 45 sec.), I watched it cross in close proximity to the Sun. It was hard to keep it in view at this point, so I waited for it to come out the other side of the Sun's influence. It never appeared again, and I then went to look back at the beginning of the trail. It was nowhere to be seen.;25.7331538461538;-80.2683307692308
