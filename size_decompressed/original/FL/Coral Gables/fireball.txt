UFO sighting Florida.;2017-11-06 19:35:00;15 minutes;UFO Sighting Florida I was standing on the University Metrorail stop, waiting for my train home.  Upon staring in the distance I noticed three orbs of orange light hovering above the suburbian houses.   They were defeinitly too high up to be drones and too stationary to be airplanes.  I noticed one of them moving at a slow rate, it had white lights on the sides that seemed to be flashing.  After seeing numerous videos of these orbs, I can confirm that they were the same as the ones on YouTube and other video sharing platforms.   I am not sure but in the distance I could see small sparks flying off of one of them.;25.7331538461538;-80.2683307692308
