2 UFOs (saucer type) following each other in the sky;2008-03-02 21:50:00;10-15 seconds;2 UFOs (saucer type) following each other in the sky About 1 mile from our balcony, we clearly saw 2 discs flying in a formattion (following each other) and hovering fast.   They had an orange-yellow light at the bottom and the top of the disc was kind of white-grey.  They made no noise and were flying very fast across the entire sky until they were no longer visible to us.   It was definitely not a plane, air ballon or anything else but just a UFO.;25.7331538461538;-80.2683307692308
