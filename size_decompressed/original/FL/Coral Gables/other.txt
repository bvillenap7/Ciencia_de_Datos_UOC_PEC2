Fast moving white fuzzy circular object flying across the sky;2004-11-10 19:00:00;5-10 seconds;Fast moving white fuzzy circular object flying across the sky The craft was whitish colored and blurry looking, llike there was a haze around it.  It was circular shaped but we could make some distinctions around the edges that changed the shape slightly to resemble a clover that had more of one circular look as opposed to four seperate shapes. The craft sped across the sky seeming to move side ways.  It would speed up and slow down appearing to move backwards slightly and then speed forward again.  It moved very fast. The sky was clear and dark when we saw the flying object. Also, it seemed to be very close to us, it appeared just less than an inch in size to us in the sky.;25.7331538461538;-80.2683307692308
