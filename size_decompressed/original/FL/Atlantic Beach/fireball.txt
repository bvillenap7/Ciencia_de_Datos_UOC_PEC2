big bright orange and red fireball;2011-08-30 01:30:00;5mins;big bright orange and red fireball We were driving from mcdonalds and we turned down a road that we use as a short cut. I happend to look up and there was this big ball of orange and red light and it look to have fire around itand it was just hovering up above.  The was no noise comeing from the object.  I watched it for 5 mins it didnt move so i drove home thinking maybe when i got home i could see it still and get a photo because it was so big and bright.  But when i made ir home u could no longer see it.;30.3483;-81.4168
