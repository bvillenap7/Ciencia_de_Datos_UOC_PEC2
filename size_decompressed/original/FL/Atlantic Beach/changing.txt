Unusual points of light in the Atlantic Beach sky.;2014-11-22 00:00:00;30 minutes;Unusual points of light in the Atlantic Beach sky. I was just sitting outside tonight, looking directly above my head in Atlantic Beach, FL.  Staring above and to the western sky, I saw what resembled descriptions of the AZ lights.  The difference was the lights I saw seemed so far away that the speed they were exhibiting is indescribable. These lights were so far away though that if not witnessed continuously would resemble stars. I kept my head turned upwards, with my gaze staring in a single position, and the lights moved outside of my periphery.  This was my way of determining the lights were moving.    At certain points, there seemed to be 1 to 6 lights illuminated at once.  Then, all but one light would be visible.  Then the lights seemed to illuminate the way a Cuttlefish displays its luminescence.  The semi-circle luminescence moved to the northwest. Looking at a single point in the far away sky, I would stare at the last point I saw a light, and then the light would disappear, and then the light would reappear at a different point.  I knew it was a different point because I hadn’t moved my gaze and when the light reappeared I had to move my eyes. The lights seemed to at some moments to be in a semi-circular configuration, maybe 4-6 lights, and then they would dissipate to 3, and then just 1 light. At intervals the lights seemed to kind of flash heat lightening, but the “heat lightning” would move quickly like the individual lights did. I look at the sky often and have never seen anything like this.  I am quite shaken. Did anyone else witness this?
