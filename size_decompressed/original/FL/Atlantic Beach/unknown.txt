At 5:03 am, I checked our security cams, and, for the first several seconds of clicking on our security cam 1, the security system kept saying the system is busy and unable to record when I clicked armed or record. My husband and I received a series of notifications (thru the security cam app we use) regarding motions detected, but he seemed to be ignoring them though. I checked the security cam 1 and viewed it live. It seemed like something was interfering with it. I shared the live cam with my husband, but he said they were spider webs. Below is one of the video clips that I saved on my phone. More than 4 bright lights/or light reflections started moving sporadically later in the recordings, while 3 of them, shaped like small squares, were vertically aligned at the top left of the video. I think the video below was recorded at 5:25 am. I stopped the recording at about 5:45 am, and those unidentified sporadic bright lights were still hovering ne! ar or by the security cam 1. I'm assuming this event lasted about an hour, because at around 6 am, the sun generally starts to rise. I also noticed in one of the recorded clips, a bunch of raccoons were running across the other side of the street towards where the dumpster is and away from our driveway.;30.3483;-81.4168
