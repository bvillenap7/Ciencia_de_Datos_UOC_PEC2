I was stargizing with a friend, pointed out the north star, then turned around and saw an intensely bright shape hovering over a series of homes (though it could have been farther away.) I called my friend, and by looks it could not have been an airplane or a helicopter. It had three incredibly bright white lights arranged one on top, two on bottom (like a triangle). It was stationary for five minutes, then slowly rose up, then to the left. It did it again, this time a bit faster, and twice more. It was very smooth in motion. It suddenly accellerated to the left, and when it passed by us, I could discern a red strobe between the lights. We watched... and then it sharply accelerated and was gone.;28.7152049921995;-81.393526365056

Picture of triangular craft with laser beam propulsion.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-12 22:00:00;1 min;Picture of triangular craft with laser beam propulsion. I took a picture of the night sky.  When I looked at it 2 days later on the computer screen I noticed a laser like beam in the pic.  Closer up, I noticed a Long Triangle shape craft in front of the beam.  Probably some cool military craft, it had no lights in it.  Planes get in my night shots all the time.  This was different.  My friend suggested I contact you.  I am just curious what it is.  Even it its just a satellite that would be cool.  I just like taking pictures of the stars.  But, things like this strike my curiosity.

It was triangle shaped and it started to follow me and lower in closer to the direction i was walking.  I turned around and called someone close by to pick me up.
