Two glowing discs slowly glide accross Longwood FL night sky.;2005-10-12 02:05:00;20 seconds;Two glowing discs slowly glide accross Longwood FL night sky. Standing in a wide open viewing area, 2:04 AM a swimming pool next to a cul-de-sac, two witnesses watched in amazement as two glowing off white oval shaped discs, dimmer than stars and no flashing lights whatsoever glided side by side underneath the stars but way above our heads, travelling from NW to SE headed just to the left of Orion's constellation.  At first I reasoned it might be the white tips of a birds wings but no visible outline of a bird was noticed by either witness and the objects were headed away from any wilderness area and also we'd never seen a white tipped winged bird flying this late in the evening.;28.7152049921995;-81.393526365056
Formation of 8-10 lights suddenly disbursing in opposite directions.;2014-04-18 21:00:00;5-10 minutes;Formation of 8-10 lights suddenly disbursing in opposite directions As four of us (my husband, my cousin and his wife, and myself - 4 four adults in our 30s) were driving on 427 we arrived at the traffic light on the intersection of 427 & Dock Track Rd, we immediately noticed a formation of bright lights glowing very brightly, much brighter than the stars.   We almost assumed it was a constellation but they began to move, 2 of the lights simultaneously began pulling apart from the constellation, hovering further away from the other bright lights, and suddenly they shot upward and disappeared.   As we turned left onto Dog Track Rd, we observed the other lights moving away, all in formation - they couldn't have been planes, these lights where amber/yellowish and super bright, they stood out from the sky and a lot of cars stopped to look, it was an amazing sight!;28.7152049921995;-81.393526365056
