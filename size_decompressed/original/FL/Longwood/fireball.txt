Four orange glowing globes floating quickly and silently in a fairly straight line then vanish one by one.;2012-08-31 21:40:00;2 minutes;Four orange glowing globes floating quickly and silently in a fairly straight line then vanish one by one. On August 31, 2012, around 21:40 my husband and I were walking in our Longwood, FL neighborhood.  We reached the entrance of the development and turned to go home.  I noticed in the sky three orange glowing globes moving single file in fairly a straight line.  They were floating silently and steadily across the sky.  I asked my husband what he thought they were.  He said they were military planes, but then said they weren’t moving fast enough to be military planes.  We turned to see where they came from and saw a fourth one.  We tried to keep all of them in sight as they moved from northeast to southwest and turned more toward the west.  The first seemed to go up higher and suddenly disappeared.  My husband asked where it went.  At first we thought it went behind a cloud, but the clouds were very thin, so thin that you could see a star through them.  One by one the rest of the globes vanished in the same fashion.  We sighted the globes and they vanished all ! in probably about a minute or two. We really could not determine how high they were, but they were travelling in a specific direction and quickly.;28.7152049921995;-81.393526365056
Three orange globes in a line in equal distance from each other slowly moving east to west;2013-07-04 21:24:00;1 minute;My husband was out watching fireworks in neighborhood, while looking up at about a 30 to 45 degree angle from the horizon he saw three orange globes in a line in equal distance from each other slowly moving east to west.   No sound and definitely not fireworks, a plane or helicopter.   Not foreign matter floating, but directed and sustained movement.  Length of sighting was about a minute before they faded away.   This was very similar to a sighting we saw together on August 31, 2012.;28.7152049921995;-81.393526365056
I was looking out sliding glass door to the north when I saw one red light at about a 45 to 60 degree angle to the horizon in the sky.;2013-07-04 22:24:00;2 minutes;I was looking out sliding glass door to the north when I saw one red light at about a 45 to 60 degree angle to the horizon in the sky.  It was not moving.  It was not fireworks.   It was stationary looking about the size of a large star.   I called to my husband who also saw it.  He ran to get binoculars and went outside, but he could not see it from the front of the house.   A small plane flew toward it from south to north seemingly in a direct path to the light.   As the plane got closer to the light it appeared that the plane was actually higher than the light.  As the plane appeared to move closer to it the light faded and disappeared.   Just a few minutes later a helicopter flew north to south lower than where the light and plane had been.;28.7152049921995;-81.393526365056
A bright, circular, floating orange colored object with orange fog that dissipated after mini explosions and fell out of the sky.;2014-08-15 00:00:00;10-15 minutes;A bright, circular, floating orange colored object with orange fog that dissipated after mini explosions and fell out of the sky. To start this off, first I must say for the simple fact of myself even telling this story is difficult. The witness contact made me feel a little eerie but I’ll take a chance anyway.  After reading a few other UFO sighting reports and understanding what happened to a few of those people such as, “The Maury Island Incident,” it’s made me feel inclined to shutting my mouth.  Please don’t think this is fake because I “N/A” my personal information. I wouldn’t waste an hour writing a fake story about what I’ve seen because it’s a serious matter.  Anyone who fakes these stories should be ashamed. The story is, I am a rapper.  I travel quite a bit honestly and don’t see much UFO activity, nor have I seen any since this night.  I don’t go out looking for this stuff!  Sometime in Mid-August of 2014, I had an all-night studio session.  On the way to the studio, I called my friend to accompany me and he agreed to tag along.  When we got there my engineer was upstairs waiting and we began our night. About 2 or 3 hours into recording, I finished a song and told my engineer I was stepping out for a smoke with my friend.  It was a black n’ mild (tobacco), not weed so I’m pretty damn sure there were no hallucinations.  When we came downstairs we walked to the middle of the empty parking lot (besides my car) and lit it and started talking about things non related to the issue. A moment passed and I looked up (I like to star gaze) and far in the air was something I’ve never seen before.  I tapped my friend and pointed up, cursing.  Honestly because I was a little scared, I’ve never seen anything like that before.  We sat there well over a minute staring at whatever this thing is floating in the air. Here’s where things get technical. First off the sky was clear, nothing to mistake this for.  The moon was full and the object height wise was next to the moon.  Distance wise, it was at least 4 or 5 miles away from us.  To get a better idea of this think about a plane passing by in the sky, only this object was “floating.” If you were to look at a full moon, put your hand up and make a 3 to 4 inch gap with your fingers from the edge of the moon and that is how far the object looked away from the moon from our point of view. It was bright orange, with a little yellow. It was smoking and had an orange fog around it as if it was about to explode. Initially we thought it was an aircraft that exploded in the air. Contrary to that there were no airplanes or helicopters visible anywhere within our sight! That’s weird especially in Central Florida speaking on how we have nonstop air traffic.  One thing I did notice was that a few birds were flying in the opposite direction of this thing in the sky. It was circular, large and almost seemed like something ran into it, or hit it with something. It began to smoke heavily but the smoke was drifting to the side of it where we could still clearly see it.  As the smoke thickened pieces of it began to fly off, almost looking like it was getting shot by another aircraft. About 3 mini, non-hearable explosions took place before we started backing up. About 8 to 10 minutes went by before I finally pulled out my phone and called my engineer to immediately come outside. I don’t know why his reaction was like this but he didn’t seem pretty surprised. He actually told us it’s probably just the “military’s doing.”  I told him he was full of it and tried to take a picture.  The damn thing showed up as a blur on every single one of my pictures! I’ve always owned an iPhone which is generally known for taking good pictures but tonight it was as if something prevented my phone from snapping a picture clearly. After maybe 5 more minutes of staring, the fog around it began to consume the craft and eventually as oddly as it was the in the sky, it dissipated, slowly fell and disintegrated almost to what seemed into thin air.  Not believing what I’d just seen I looked around to see if anyone else was outside staring at the phenomenon and sure enough right in front of us was a man walking by on the sidewalk stopping to stare in the same area we were looking. As there was no way to show evidence and prove what we had seen to anyone else we shook it off, went back into the studio and honestly never spoke about it again.

Yellow fireball.;2015-01-01 01:45:00;10 minutes;Object started as a yellow fireball and transformed to a red light.  Hovered overhead then headed west but not in a straight line.  Returned to original spot overhead, no noise.   Definitely not a helicopter or plane.;28.7152049921995;-81.393526365056
7 round balls of fire flying across Longwood, Florida, in the night sky.;2015-05-22 23:22:00;7 minutes;7 round balls of fire flying across Longwood, Florida, in the night sky. 7 red-orange fireballs flying across the night sky during the crescent moon.  They were round like a fireball with these amazing blue/white lighting (not typical fluorescent lighting).   They were slowly moving in formation, then out of formation making a diagonal line (somewhat), then disappeared into the dark clouds heading northeast.
