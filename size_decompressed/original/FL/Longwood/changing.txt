We saw what we thought initially was falling debris, metal, as it's reflective surface caught the sun as it tumbled, but then we realized it was maneuvering and changing shape as it got closer. My son said get your phone after we watched it for a minute or two, and the attached video is the end of the sighting before we lost sight of it behind a tree. It was geometrical, like a cube, but changed shape. It appeared large (depending on how far away it was), with a highly reflective surface on one side. It made no noise but seemed to maneuver and change direction as it hovered.;28.7152049921995;-81.393526365056
