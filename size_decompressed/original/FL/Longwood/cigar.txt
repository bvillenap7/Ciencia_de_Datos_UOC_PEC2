Long Cigar Shaped UFO Slowly Spinning in Central Florida April 2004;2004-04-22 11:15:00;10 minutes;Long Cigar Shaped UFO Slowly Spinning in Central Florida April 2004 Coming out of the store with a large group of people , this long silver metallic cigar shaped aircraft caught my eye. It was high in the sky and it seemed to be moving very slowly parallel to the Earth's ground. It almost seemed like it wasn't moving until it started to spin long ways.  Both my husband and I tried to watch it as long as possible and even kept an eye on it as we were driving away.  We noticed that when it spun long ways slowy, it would also stop at once parrallel to the Earth's ground again. That's how we knew it was a controlled object and that the wind was not just moving it wherever.  Not ever hearing about any UFO's that were cigar shaped, this took us completely off guard. We made our friends in the other cars stop to see it and they all said it was a weather balloon. None of us know what a weather balloon looks like, and if it was, it wouldn't be able to move and stop like it did.  The further we drove away, the higher it seemed to be , until we lost all sight of it. It was in the late morning, the skies were clear, and it was not that windy out.
