Flashes in sky;2010-03-07 20:00:00;15 minutes;Flashes in sky On march 7th about 8:00pm in the south sky, between the three stars of Orions belt and Betelgeuse I saw a flash in the sky.   At first I thought it was a meteor, then I saw it again (just a flash).  I saw the flash about 9 times and about one minute apart for about 15 minutes.   I could not tell if it was moving because they were only flashes and appeared to stay in the same spot.  At one point I got my binoculars to see a little better.  It seemed to be up above the level planes fly.  I know satellites move but this was no satellite.  Meteors wouldnâ€™t stay in the same spot.   Do you have any idea what that could have been?  Any input from you would be appreciated.   Thanks;28.7152049921995;-81.393526365056
