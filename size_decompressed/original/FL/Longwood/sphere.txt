The craft was lower in the air than a plane would fly.   My kids and I got into the car in a parking lot happened to look up and saw a sphere shaped object in the sky just spinning and hovering.  It had red and whitish lights on it but one white light was much brighter than the other lights on the UFO.   Then it slowly started to go away.   We were in Longwood it was headed towards Altamonte springs.;28.7152049921995;-81.393526365056
2 Orange Orbs in the evening sky.;2013-03-23 20:15:00;2-3 minutes;2 Orange Orbs in the evening sky. We live north of the Orlando Florida area. Longwood to be exact. We also live in the flight pattern of the Sanford and Orlando International airport. Saturday evening March 23, 2013 about 8:15 pm, my husband and I were having dinner on our patio. At about 30 degrees above the horizon, thru the trees we saw first one then two orange orbs.  They (the orbs) were coming from the south moving to the north. At the same time a commercial airliner was traveling from the north to the south. That’s when the orbs slowed and turned to the east. We thought they were helicopters at first. Then we thought there might have been a rocket launch at Cape Canaveral.  We see them all the time from our house. The orbs were as big and bright as the rockets they launch without the vapor trail. Canaveral doesn’t launch 2 rockets at the same time.  We don’t know what we saw. I grabbed my Ipad and took a video of them. Not real clear and it was as they were fading away. The whole thing lasted about 2 to 3 minutes. They faded off to the east.;28.7152049921995;-81.393526365056
Looked like slow-moving embers in a circular shape rising, leveling off, flying in straight line, then fading out.;2013-12-31 13:00:00;2 minutes;Looked like slow-moving embers in a circular shape rising, leveling off, flying in straight line, then fading out. Saw orange/red circular shape rise up then level and go in a straight line until it went out or disappeared.  Saw the same thing about 3-5 min. later. Saw 4 rise together about a year ago then drift/fly/float over my house, one at a time, before fading out.  When I first saw them rising, I thought they were maybe military helicopters in formation.  They were in the air for at least 5 min.;28.7152049921995;-81.393526365056
3 Super Fast;2020-05-30 20:55:00;40 seconds;3 Super Fast My apartment faces East. I was standing out on my 4th story balcony taking videos of the lightening (we had a severe thunderstorm warning). After a few minutes of recording, I saw from my North East point of view what looked like a huge deep orange fireball moving way faster than an aircraft.  It was not blinking. It was flying super fast in a Western direction. I estimate around 800 mph high in the atmosphere--as it was moving much faster than the (normal red, white, and blue) blinking airplanes headed towards the Orlando International Airport. I at first thought it was a meteor in the atmosphere that came too close, or maybe the international space station, or even a lantern someone let off, but realized it wasn't any of those things. This fireball orb also had a faint white glow around the orange on the exterior. It's brightness fluctuated. It kept its path but seemed to slow down and speed up as it went...It then got smaller, darted, and completely disappeared into thin air.  About 1-2 minutes later another identical looking fireball darted from the exact same direction and headed in the same direction at the same speed, also before completely vanishing around the same area. Before the 2nd fireball orb vanished, it remained in the same place in the sky. I actually took a video of these first 2 that I will email.  The 3rd glowing fireball was much further to my north peaking in and out of the trees (you could tell it was much further away), getting brighter and fainter repetitively until it too, vanished. (this 3rd one was too distant to get on camera but I witnessed it).  I have footage of the first 2 glowing orb fireballs on my iPhone. The closer I zoomed in on my iPhone I realized it seemed to be changing shaped and others seemed to be flashing in an out of the sky. I will edit my footage so that you can see those parts in slow-motion.  The space launch sight (Cape Canaveral) is more to my South-East and I see the launches. I saw the historical launch today. While the rockets look orange in the dark, they have a super specific trajectory and are far more distant. There were also no other launches today. These fireballs were pretty sizable, much closer, and flying then disappearing. I know what I saw and it was nothing like the rocket launches, didn't look like any of the airplanes, and these glowing orb fireballs looked like nothing I had ever seen before.  They only came around as the severe thunderstorm moved away South-West towards downtown Orlando and it had stopped raining at my place. (Tons of lightning);28.7152049921995;-81.393526365056
