Last night at around 10:00 p.m while watching TV with the Girlfriend and her 11 year old son, I noticed out the window (at about 20 degrees above the horizon) what appeared to be a rocket taking off from Kennedy Space Center (which is about 40 miles due south of our home). After commenting on this, we all hurried outside to witness the event. Soon on the lawn, we became aware that the craft was much closer (within 3-5 miles) than originally thought and was moving in differning directions. I had the 11 year old get the sony camcorder from the house and I recorded the following: The craft is filmed for about 2 minutes moving in differing directions. Definietly not a helicopter or plane. There appeared to be two-three distinct lights on the craft, but could have been more. It is seen traveling behind a pine tree in the distance (the tree being about 200 yrds off) and slowly is lost from the field of vision. There may have been one other such craft in the sky at the time, but I was unable to capture both objects simultaniously on film. I have retained the footage and intend to have it analyzed;28.7152049921995;-81.393526365056
dark fixed object in sky over Longwood, Florida;2008-01-14 17:45:00;10 minutes;dark fixed object in sky over Longwood, Florida Monday January 14, 2008, 5:30 PM  I was driving south on US 17-92 from Sanford to Longwood, Florida and saw a black fixed object in the sky.  I would say it was from 3000 to 5000 feet up in the sky.  It had no particular shape and was not large, but not small. It did not have any lights.  Without knowing really how high it was, itâ€™s size could not be estimated accurately.  It remained in place for at least 10 minutes.  Others must of seen it who also were driving south on SR 17-92  It was definitely not a plane or helicopter. I had to turn off 17-92 , but returned shortly thereafter and the object was no longer in the sky.;28.7152049921995;-81.393526365056
Round reflective object flying slowly East to West over Longwood, FL at sunset;2021-04-04 20:07:00;~3 minutes;Round reflective object flying slowly East to West over Longwood, FL at sunset Observer background: Engineer working in the defense industry. Healthy adult with good hearing and vision. Time of sighting: 8:07 PM, US Eastern time, 4/4/2021 Duration of sighting: 3 minutes The weather at the time of the sighting was clear. There was very little wind at ground level, no clouds were in the sky, and the sun was setting. I saw a light in the sky off to the East. At first I assumed it was an aircraft, but I noticed it looked a bit odd. There was only a single light, and it seemed to be flickering the way a reflected fire might. The object  seemed to be at a fairly high altitude, approximately that of a commercial aircraft higher than a helicopter would typically fly. The object was moving from East to West in what seemed to be a straight line, at a very consistent and somewhat slow speed, compared to a commercial jet. The object didn't  fly directly over me, I was a bit North of its path. As it came closer I realized the illumination on the object was because it was reflecting the setting sun - that it's front surface was apparently reflective. At least, that is my assumption. When the object went past me and I could see the bottom and back of it, I saw no other lights. No running lights of any kind were visible. The bottom and rear sides appeared dark or black. The object did not appear to be large, and I could not make out any detail. It appeared to be a simple shape such as an oval or sphere. There were no wings, no fins, or other projecting parts visible. The object did not leave any visible wake or contrail behind it. There was no detectable sound from the object at any point during the sighting. The object continued on its straight-line course at the same consistent altitude and speed until it was out of sight over the treeline on the Western horizon. No other observers were nearby.;28.7152049921995;-81.393526365056
