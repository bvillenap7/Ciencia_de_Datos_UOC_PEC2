Huge Silent Chevron with all white lights surrounded by gas flying slow and low about 100 feet off ground for 15 minutes.;1981-09-28 21:30:00;15 minutes;Huge Silent Chevron with all white lights surrounded by gas flying slow and low about 100 feet off ground for 15 minutes. Flying NW from Cape Canaveral/Kennedy. Boomerang/chevron shaped. Surrounded by a gas like fog. Totally silent. As it approached directly over us it slowed to about 10-15 miles per hour. It got very low, barely above treetops and rooftops. Did not cause any breeze or wind when overhead. So huge it covered almost the entire block. Color appeared dark gray or black yet seemed partially opaque/translucent/transparent combined. It blocked out part of the night sky yet in spots you could see the stars through it. Difficult to look straight up as it went directly overhead as lights were a blinding constant white. It looked like one solid object at times yet also like 7 to 12 individual objects somehow connected. It continued on past us in the same direction at the same speed. It did not accelerate speed but it did go a little higher.;28.7152049921995;-81.393526365056
Huge chevron, just above rooftops, speed about15 mph, no sound, no wind, enclosed by white fog, very bright lights.;1981-09-28 21:35:00;15 minutes;Huge chevron, just above rooftops, speed about15 mph, no sound, no wind, enclosed by white fog, very bright lights. Sorry, I've been using computers for over 40 years and still can't cut & paste.  I am 72 now but had the sighting when in my mid 30's.  Would be glad to speak to someone about this via phone or in person. Have no photo's but made several interesting drawings (can explain later) and also a map showing the flight path. I would very much like to talk to someone else who has seen the same thing I saw.  Hope this helps UNFORC reveal the truth to others. For me there is no doubt any longer.;28.7152049921995;-81.393526365056
6 lights in a chevron shape.;2014-12-15 20:00:00;5 minutes;6 lights in a chevron shape. I was driving down my street, when I looked up and saw 6 blazing balls in a V shape.  I was near my home so I ran inside and got my boyfriend who also saw the lights, but they were dimming and had moved.;28.7152049921995;-81.393526365056
