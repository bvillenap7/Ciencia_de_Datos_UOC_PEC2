Leaving from home, i turned to say by, when I looked at the sky I observed two orbs in the clear blue sky.  I told my wife to look up a tell me what she sees and she said, that shouldn't be there.  The orbs looked like two small moons and there was no sound at all. We returned to our home a got our spotting telescope and looked at them, they were very bright and no type of markings on them.  They were not moving fast just sitting there, they drifted from the west to the east and stayed for around an hour.   We called the local radio station and they said we will let our weather team look into it.  Yea, right.   We also call my mom in another town and she also could see them but they were smaller in size from her prospective.  I hope this will be verified.;30.4193;-81.9724
