I was in the house and my girlfriend yelled at me to come outside quick, in which I did, she was with my neighbor and I ran outside because I thought some one was threatening them.   I looked up and to where they were pointing at and saw a formation of white lights in which first thought was just a military aircraft formation   (I worked on a flight deck of an aircraft carrier for 3 yrs prior and have seen thousands of formations and different aircraft even soviet)  the UFO’s were I estimate  around 3000 to 5000 feet. They took formations of all different kinds and where completely SILENT.  I called the police and made a report.  Freaky stuff.  I didn’t think the cop would believe me but he took the report down.
