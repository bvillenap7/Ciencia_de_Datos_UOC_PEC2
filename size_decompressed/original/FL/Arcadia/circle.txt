Red Light in the sky;2014-03-30 21:00:00;2 minutes;Red Light in the sky Me and my wife were driving West on Hwy 70.  We saw a round object flying towards us which was glowing almost red colour.  It was getting close to us very fast so we pulled over and got out of the car to get a better look.  The object stopped for a few seconds almost on top of us for a few seconds and suddenly started flying away in a opposite direction without making a turn around as plane would do. It just stopped and then reversed.   We got back in a car and followed it for about a minute.  It started blinking, then stop blinking and then lights went out and it disappeared.  It looked like it was flying up.  Unfortunately we were too shocked to start recording right away, but my wife managed to get a few seconds video wile we were standing next to the car.   It was right next to Arcadia Municipal Airport, but we saw planes in the sky at that time also and it clearly wasn't a plane.   It had no flashing light, was different round-like form and was moving the way planes can't. It also made absolutely no sound.;27.1763619047619;-81.8779333333333
