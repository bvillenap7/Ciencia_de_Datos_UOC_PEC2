2 large orange lights from southeast to northwest route, absolutley no sound.;2013-01-04 18:00:00;10 minutes;2 large orange lights from southeast to northwest route, absolutley no sound It was an orange ball that I spotted in the southeastern sky and went to northwestern route out of site.   It was very bright and was just under the cloud cover because the lights reflected in the clouds.  There was no sound when it went directly overhead.  Maybe 3 minutes pass and another one went the same exact route and was the orange color.   I could see a physical shape because of the bright lights. I know it was not a plane with landing lights on.  The night was very still, no wind what so ever.;27.1763619047619;-81.8779333333333
