Craft over Wesley Chapel Florida on clear afternoon.;2007-05-27 17:15:00;20 sec;Craft over Wesley Chapel Florida on clear afternoon. On approximately May 27, 2007 at 17:15 hours. I was going home with my son. It was a clear day. I and my son observed a pear shape craft approximately 75 to 100ft in front of us. It made a sharp turn.  The craft was only 300 ft or less above the tree line. We were stunned since I don’t believe in UFO’s. As the craft makes a sharp turn. It stopped for a couple of seconds. It then took off at an angle and disappear within 3 seconds (invisible). No heat or smoke coming out of engine.  All I saw was green lights around back.  Color of craft was grayish. I’m an air force vet who has been around many military aircraft’s and have never seen one like this.  I’m also a ex-sheriff Deputy. I’m glad I had my son with me or I would have never believed it.
