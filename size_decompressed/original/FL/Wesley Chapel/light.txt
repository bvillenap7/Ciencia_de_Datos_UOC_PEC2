It came down in angle kind of like a shooting star very fast and just disappeared. I thought it was the moon for a second but realized the moon was there and the ball was a little less than half its size. If some one else saw this please post it I am curious.

We were looking up at the sky when a random Bright White light appeared out of nowhere, it traveled normal plane speed but was going down, then it sped up really fast, then it dispersed, but it looked like sparks came out of it, but the spark like objects all flew extremely fast in different directions. Then the main object that dispersed the &quotsparks&quot diappeared. We went inside and told my parents, but as I was going into the garage, I was looking straight up when something flew overhead at extremely fast speeds, leaving a streak of White light. Then we saw no more. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));28.2389461538461;-82.3259999999994
A very obvious bright white light appeared and it wasn't high enough in the sky to be an a/c.  ((anonymous report));2017-07-19 00:00:00;20 minutes;We were driving and were stopped at a stop light.  A very obvious bright white light appeared and it wasn't high enough in the sky to be an airplane.  It looked like it almost started lowering and then it just started moving west of us.  It startled us.   Then, after that, we continue along home and were skeptical, still looking at the sky, and we see red and green lights far away obviously but going in the same direction we were and it happened AGAIN.  It was moving kinda fast and then lit up bright just like the other one.  It literally looks like a cars headlights, but only one ball of light, like an orb.  It just started moving along, not speeding but going fast.  It eventually just disappeared and didn't see it after that.   It gave us goosebumps.;28.2389461538461;-82.3259999999994
8-9 Disc shaped lights moving south about 1000 feet up with no sound.;2019-12-31 23:55:00;30 minutes;8-9 Disc shaped lights moving south about 1000 feet up with no sound. Single large disc shaped lights moved one at a time going south at varying speeds.  Took video from phone but doesnâ€™t do what we saw with the naked eye justice.;28.2389461538461;-82.3259999999994
