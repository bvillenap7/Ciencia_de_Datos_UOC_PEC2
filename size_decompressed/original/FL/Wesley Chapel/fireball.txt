Big green ball of fire falling from the sky.;2011-08-11 22:40:00;5 seconds;Big green ball of fire falling from the sky. I seen the sky flash green, it looked like lighting at first, then a big green ball of fire came falling down from the sky!   It was falling so fast and landed in an empty field.  The ball was lighting up green and had fire coming from the back of it.;28.2389461538461;-82.3259999999994
An amber colored light appeared on the horizon and moved slowly, in a very straight line, East to West.;2014-01-01 00:15:00;90 seconds;An amber colored light appeared on the horizon and moved slowly, in a very straight line, East to West. Seen from my backyard, while watching new year's fireworks.  An amber colored light appeared on the horizon and moved towards us, until it was directly overhead (my house obscured the view after that).  It moved slowly, in a very straight line, East to West.  At its closest, I viewed it through binoculars and could only see a flickering amber light (almost like fire).  There were no blinking lights to indicate it was a commercial aircraft.  The speed was similar to that of a commercial jet, but the light was far too large for a plane at that height. It did not seem to make any sound.

Two red balls of fire rise into the sky...hover...and fly away from us.;2016-08-17 21:30:00;2:45;Two red balls of fire rise into the sky...hover...and fly away from us. We were watching the International Space Station pass by.   Then, after it flew out of sight, we turned toward the north and saw what looked like a red ball of fire rising straight up from the horizon.  It stopped rising about halfway in the sky and began to hover.   Then a second red ball of fire rose from the horizon just to the right of the first light.  It stopped and hovered at the exact same height as the first.   They both remained hovering...moving slightly every once in awhile.   Then, the first ball appeared to begin moving away from us and disappeared.  The second red ball then did the same.   No sound was heard.  (We could see aircraft approaching from the northeast on a normal pattern for our area.).;28.2389461538461;-82.3259999999994
