Two UFOs moving in formation;2012-07-09 22:40:00;Approximately two minutes;Two UFOs moving in formation At 10:40 I was sitting in my back yard in my hammock facing south east. A star/planet, I presumed, directly above my head (out of my line of sight) suddenly was very bright and I turned to look at it. It was brighter than any other star/planet I have ever seen after years of sky watching. It appeared to turn in place, and I thought for a second it must be a satellite. After about ten seconds it dimmed and began moving south east. As it began moving I immediately noticed another light that was about as far away as the width of the moon was moving with it. The two lights remained at the same distance throughout the rest of the sighting. At first they moved south for about twenty seconds, then turned and headed east. They then turned again and were moving to the north east until I lost sight of them. During the encounter there was no sound. To the east of my location on the Gulf Coast there are active lightning storms and the flashing can sometimes be seen, but above my area the sky is completely clear and silent. The things I saw could not have been stars or planets as they moved across the entire sky within two minutes. They could not have been satellites or other human objects in orbit because they did not maintain a straight course. They could not be planes as they were initially stationary, nor helicopters because they were above jet traffic â€“ which is too high for helicopters to fly. All other ordinary explanations simply fail to account for what was seen.;28.2389461538461;-82.3259999999994
