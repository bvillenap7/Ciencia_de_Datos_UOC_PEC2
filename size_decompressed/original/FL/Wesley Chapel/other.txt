bright light moving at an extremely high rate of speed;2010-04-03 21:00:00;3 to 4 sec;bright light moving at an extremely high rate of speed i was coming home from the supermarket when i noticed something bright in the sky, the position was about 1 o'clock but it looked far away.  I first thought it was a plane or helicopter or a bright star.  But after I looked up the the bright light or star took off. I am not sure if it was moving or stopped when I looked up, but when i tried to make out what it was the thing was moving at extremely fast, it definitely was not a plane or helicopter. In 2 or 3 seconds it was just gone. Mt father said it was the space station but when I looked up where it was it was below south america and the next viewing would be april 6th.  I don't think it was a comet or medorite or sooting atar.;28.2389461538461;-82.3259999999994
