It hovered with three blue lights moving sideways several times, glowing brighter and at times disappearing then re-appearing. After 30 min or so it disappeared. Tried to take a picture with camera phone but no luck, was too far away to get a decent pic. Very strange..;28.2389461538461;-82.3259999999994
