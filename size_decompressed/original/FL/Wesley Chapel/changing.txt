I immediately called my husband and son so they can take a look at it.  We looked thru our binoculars and can clearly see 4 lights 2 blue and 2 white, but sometimes one of the white lights would merge into one of the other lights making it 3 lights.  The lights changed around sometimes forming a triangle, a square, a diamond and other times three lights would line up and the fourth would stand across the them. These lights hovered for several hours moving up and down and to the sides.  I believe it was 4 crafts because of the way the lights moved around but we could see a dark shadow between the lights that implied it may have been one ship and itâ€™s lights were moving around it. Eventually the neighbors started noticing the lights and at one point there were about 11 of us outside witnessing the same thing. Eventually the lights moved out of our line of sight and unfortunately we were unable to continue seeing them.;28.2389461538461;-82.3259999999994
black changing shape during sunset;2019-01-02 17:00:00;5 seconds;black changing shape during sunset Looking to the West at the colors of the sunset through binoculars.  Notice a black shape moving in the sky at what was about 10,000 and 3-4 miles to the West (best estimate).  The object was moving what looked like due north and I followed it with the binoculars.  I know this sounds ridiculous but it looked like a trash bag...black and changing shape as it moved to the north.  No garbage bag was at 10,000 feet blowing around.  We seen what could have been the same object about 20 minutes later come from above and behind the clouds where it could be seen for a few seconds and then retreated.  No lights, no color, no sound. I checked flightradar24 and there was nothing in that area...but theres absolutely no way it was a plane anyway.;28.2389461538461;-82.3259999999994
