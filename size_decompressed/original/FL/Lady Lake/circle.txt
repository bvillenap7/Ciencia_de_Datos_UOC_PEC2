Strange round blue light shot upward instead of downward to upward. It shot up super fast and at first I thought it was a meteor until it suddenly moved in a bizzare pattern and slowed down as I was pointing at it trying to figure out what it was.   Then it suddenly slowed down a little, and went horizontal as it flew over head above my house, it moved extremely fast when it first shot across the sky, way too fast to be a plain or drone.   Than it slowed down some, and flew quietly above head and I couldn't see it past the big oak tree after it passed that.  I went back out there hoping to see it again, nothing, but I did see a meteor typical meteor, nothing special there. Whatever I saw is gone.  It was just one big blue light circle.   I really wish it would come back. I did not see multiple lights on it or anything.  Just one big blue light and round in shape.   The first one I know was NOT a meteor, and I'm certain you will be getting more reports about this.  I'd be surprised if you didn't.;28.9269;-81.9227
