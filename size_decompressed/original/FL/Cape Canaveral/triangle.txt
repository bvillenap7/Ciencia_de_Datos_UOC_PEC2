Triangular steel grey craft hovering at top of vehicle bridge in  broad daylight.;2000-07-05 15:00:00;&lt5 mins;Triangular steel grey craft hovering at top of vehicle bridge in  broad daylight. Driving up 528 bridge headed towards Merritt Island, and saw triangular shaped craft hovering about 6-10 feet above the top of the bridge. Pulled over to observe craft for a little less than 5 minutes.  1. Gun metal grey, smooth no surface features 2. Completely silent 3. Headed South when it took off to outer space (like a bullet out of a rifle both south and to outer space) 4. No engines, propellers, no windows. 5. Was hovering and had very slight rocking 6. No flashing lights as a regular aircraft 7. 60-65 feet long, 40 feet long, 15 feet thick 8. When it took off the whole bottom of the craft glowed bright like welders torch bright   -This was gathered from a recent discussion about a craft seen about 20 years ago. I am not the witness, I spoke to the witness and was given this information after writing it down. I have small  than illustration can upload later.  -The peculiar aspect to the craft was how it made the witness feel, she could not decide to either get out and try and touch the craft or drive off with her small girls in the car.  -It most definitely was not Venus, a weather balloon, an experimental aircraft, reflections of any type of swamp gas, etc. It was a real, physical, metallic object that behaved unlike any craft the witness had ever observed.  -Witness was a military brat, and father was in Army.  -When the craft took off to the South, it pushed/pulled the water below the craft, signalling it had not only interacted with our atmosphere, but the water in the river. So in short, the craft was hovering ten feet above the top of the bridge, and 50 feet which is the height of the bridge. So a 60 foot distance interaction took place between the craft and the surface of the water when it took off.  -The year/date are not exact, the time of day is 3-4 P.M./15:00-16:00.  -Witness contacted NASA, and Patrick Air Force Base, both told her no craft were in the vicinity.  -Witness contacted multiple news stations, but those stations ignored her, claiming that no sightings were reported by anybody else, so it was grounds for them to ignore it.  (I feel it is my responsibility to share this information because I can type fast, am college educated and do believe the U.S. Government is lying about almost everything ET related).;28.3869000000002;-80.6022000000001
Astronomer spots triangle with white inlaid lights passing silently at low altitude.;2014-04-05 23:25:00;1 minute;Astronomer spots Triangle with white inlaid lights passing silently at low altitude In a a very dark area where there is little to no light pollution.  A triangle shape passed flat overhead a few degrees to the east.  It was heading in a northwest direction, then swiftly made a change to the northeast without banking. The craft was totally silent, it moved as if it were a glider.  Unlike most aircraft you see, its movement was distinct in that its movement seemed so effortless - (there was no loss of speed during its turn, no change in altitude, no roll, banking or any of the other traditional characteristics of powered flight.)  Underneath it had several dull, faint glowing white lights that appeared to be inlaid on the bottom and illuminated the outline of the underbelly. I compared what I saw afterwards to several online videos of F117's and B2's in night flight.  It did not resemble either.;28.3869000000002;-80.6022000000001
