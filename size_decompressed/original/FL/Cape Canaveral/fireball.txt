Large reddish orange fireball very visible in Cape Canaveral sky around 9pm on 10-27-10;2010-10-27 21:00:00;2-3 minutes;Large reddish orange fireball very visible in Cape Canaveral sky around 9pm on 10-27-10 On the night of 10-26-10 I saw a shooting star, made a wish and thought nothing more of it.  Then on the night of 10-27-10 I was standing outside on the phone with my boyfriend and I looked up and saw this large red object that resembled a fireball.   At first sight I thought it was an airplane but the whole object appeared to be red or reddish orange. I have tried looking on the internet to see if maybe there was a weather balloon or something in the air that late at night. I am 39 years old and have never seen anything like this before.  Then I thought maybe it was a comet or meteor, not quite sure what to make of it. I kept telling my boyfriend I couldn't believe what I was seeing and was very shaken by it.  I just want to know if there was anyone else that seen the same thing I saw.  I have no clue what a weather balloon would even look like and have never seen a comet that big!   Could someone give me any information on this please? Thank you.;28.3869000000002;-80.6022000000001
