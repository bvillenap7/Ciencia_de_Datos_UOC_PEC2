UAP seen as SpaceX Dragon stage one returns to earth today, 5/30/20.;2020-05-30 15:28:00;2 seconds;UAP seen as SpaceX Dragon stage one returns to earth today, 5/30/20. Today, while watching the recorded launch of the SpaceX Dragon rocket, my wife and I noticed an anomaly that deserves explanation. As the first stage of the rocket returned to earth, at approximately 6:02 (six minutes, two seconds) into the flight, an object traveling at very high speed streaks from center of the picture, and far below the rocket, slightly upward and to the right .. approximately the 2 o'clock position, if you will. Obviously, the camera providing the picture of the return is mounted on the side of the stage one rocket. In the view seen on TV, there are two directional guidance paddles (I have no idea the official name for them) that can be seen further down on the side of the rocket. The object we noticed can be seen slightly to the left of the paddle on the right as it streaks away further to the right. To me, it appears to be far below the rocket, perhaps closer to cloud level. Certainly the area in the ocean designated for the return lan! ding site is a well-known no flight area for aircraft. The speed that the object is traveling appears to far exceed that of normal aircraft.;28.3869000000002;-80.6022000000001
