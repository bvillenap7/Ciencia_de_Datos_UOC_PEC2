ufo seen by the US Coast Guard Cutter Laurel;1999-05-01 22:00:00;1 minute;ufo seen by the US Coast Guard Cutter Laurel I was standing watch on the United States Coast Guard Cutter Laurel.  Our Ship was about 150 miles off the coast of Cape Canaveral.  (The date and time of this event is off because it has been a while. ) bearing at 270 degrees on the horizon was a bright and shiny object that flew to our ship and stopped above. It took about 1 mabye 2 seconds to get from the horizon to our ship. It stopped above our ship. I was on the top of our ship  , above the bridge, which is where we stood for lookout. It was bright but it did not hurt my eyes. the water around our ship  looked like water would look at night if someone spotlighted it. what i found strange was i could look at the light without any glare. During this event, the bridge was communicating with me. Everyone thought at first it was a flare. The Captain was a sleep, because it was mistaken for a flare the Captain was awaken , which is protocol for a MayDay call.  I relayed what i was looking at back to the bridge. The object was so large i thought it was only 40 feet above us. Seconds later i found out from the bridge the object is 1 mile above us and 3 miles in circumfrence. _-Very Large - After that their was communiction over the radio that the same thing had happened to other vessels in the area. Another strange thing was that in parts of our ship where their was no light or windows for light , lit up during this event. minutes later i am explaining myself to the Captain what I saw. I was not ridiculed at all. To many people on our crew of 55 seen it. The next morning our Captain took the crew on deck and told us that he was ordered by an Admiral in the Navy to tell us That we are not to talk about what we saw ever again off or on the ship and if we did we would have to answer to him.

Orange, green fiery ball impacts outside of Cape Canaveral/Kennedy Space Center.;2019-02-12 02:00:00;2 seconds;Orange, green fiery ball impacts outside of Cape Canaveral / Kennedy Space Center Anyone see the green/orange fiery ball fall from the sky last night?  Meteorite?  It was between 1:30am and 2:30am some time.  This was really quick, but very odd.  Living next to the space center, we are fortunate enough to see the rockets go up, and some times come down - these days on purpose, mostly.  I've seen a landing of the reusable rockets from SpaceX right here in our backyard, and this thing was almost as big and bright - a bright, fiery ball of green/orange light came down much faster (if you've seen the rockets land, they come down fast) - but it didn't slow at the end like the rocket.  It was like it came down as an impact, but once it impacted beyond the line of sight, there was no sound.  As a matter of fact, there was no sound at all.  I was expecting some kind of impact.  It lasted a whole two seconds, maybe, and that was that. Anyone else see this, know anything about it, or maybe what it might have been?  Meteorite?;28.3869000000002;-80.6022000000001
