Changing shapes, orange and gold colored;2021-03-26 22:35:00;30 seconds;Changing shapes, orange and gold colored Looking to the south from my location. Appeared about 35 degrees above horizon moving from west to due east for approximately 20-25 seconds. During the last moments that I could see it, it appeared to make a turn to the north or possibly change altitudes....it was hard to tell which .  It was brighter than any star but not as bright as the moon. About 5 times the size of the North Star. The shape changed randomly...never being one particular shape. It was orange or gold in color. No tail or exhaust. I checked flight radar24 and nothing was there. No sound either. Not a lantern star, satellite or meteor. Wasn’t a plane nor drone. Don’t know what it was. I’m certain others seen it. It was pretty obvious racing across the sky.;27.9883;-82.2991000000001
