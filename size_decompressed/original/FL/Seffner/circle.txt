Round white object travelling against the wind;2010-08-21 13:10:00;@ 2 minutes;Round white object travelling against the wind A White, round object proceeding from south to north above the low cloud layer due south of Vandenberg Airport outside of Tampa.  The object traveled in a straight, unvarying course.  When it passed over a cloud I could easily estimate where it would come out again further up the path.  I just happened to look up at an aircraft that was heading south (I presume coming from Vandenberg due to its low altitude) and saw the object pass over it.  Round, white but not reflective, no noise and at first I thought it might be a parachute from the aircraft.  But after a few seconds it was obvious it was not an aircraft.  From when I saw it to when it was out of view was between 1 and 1.5 minutes.  My niece was outside at the same moment and she saw it too.  There are storms coming in from the north-west and the wind is also swirling so any balloon or something like that should not have traveled in a straight line.   I have never seen anything weird in the sky before and I get to see a lot of aircraft every day and this just stood out as quite strange.
