Multiple UFO's observed with two UFO's caught on digital video and some dark stills that show red and blue objects in the sky.;2011-11-03 00:43:00;30;Multiple UFO's observed with two UFO's caught on digital video and some dark stills that show red and blue objects in the sky. Walked-out of my house (11-02-2011) to feed the cats and this object was hovering in the distance, changing colors, red, blue, green, white.   There was another one coming-up from underneath, very intense blue color, saw it go up and make a v-turn and come back down.  The moving one was gone by the time I got the camera.   I then recorded approximately 6 1/2 mins of video, in which a third object appeared, blinking in and out several times approximately 3 minutes into the video.  Tried the zoom on my camera, but wouldn't work because it was unable to focus on the object.   Then I attempted to take some regular still pictures where you can see several objects, but the pictures are very dark.   Then saw the blue diving, climbing object again, but was still unable to catch it with the camera.  I was looking east by southeast from the front of my house in Seffner, FL.   There were a lot of stars, but they weren't bright enough to show-up on my camera.   Video of the objects can be seen at:   http://tinyurl.com/4ymvqbx;27.9883;-82.2991000000001
Two lights seen one in the eastern sky and one over head.;2012-12-01 22:00:00;30 minutes;two lights seen one in the eastern sky and one over head I saw what might have been the international space station in the eastern sky, as it seem to have red and blue colors.  I also saw a very bright star or planet like shape directly over head at around 10pm.  I observerd these same lights the night before. the light in the eastern sky caught my attention as it also seem to have a tail like a comet.  I'm just curious does anyone know what I have seen?;27.9883;-82.2991000000001
