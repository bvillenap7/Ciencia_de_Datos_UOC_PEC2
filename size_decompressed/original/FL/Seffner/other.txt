Mysterious loud booms.;2014-02-20 10:00:00;15;Mysterious loud booms Heard loud booms with no power outage or planes in sky.   Loud enough to make my husband and I look into sky for something to cause a sonic boom.   The same booms but louder were heard on 2/19/14 which were loud enough shake the house and bring several neighbors into the street to look into the sky.   We have been hearing them several times a week for the last month.   Has anyone else experienced this?;27.9883;-82.2991000000001
