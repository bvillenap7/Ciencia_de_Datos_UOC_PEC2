There had been a fireworks show in Tampa from Gasparilla celebration. We were located between Tampa and Plant City when we both witnessed hundreds of UFOs coming from the west, heading east. This went on for approximately 2 hours. We both took still shots of the ufos. I had my cell phone, and he had a digital camera. I also recorded six videos of the event which I will upload if possible. These UFOs appeared to be glowing orange orbs, or fireballs, to the naked eye.  However, when we viewed the photography that I took, they were  different colors. We estimated the distance of these objects from where we stood to be approximately half a mile away and 500 feet off the ground. One of these objects came towards us when I began taking still shots with my flash on.  The orange orb appeared to look directly at us with what appeared to be a white “eye.” This frightened us both. At that point I begin filming with my cell phone.  You can hear my friend asking me what was it that was flashing. Then you can hear me say it's my camera. As the orb drew near you can hear him on one of my videos stating that we were going to get abducted, because it was coming right at us. Neither one of us have wanted to submit these as we were too frightened and weren't sure how to do it. I have approximately 6 good quality videos and five excellent quality still shots that anyone is welcome to analyze.   We both felt these objects were not of this world.;27.9883;-82.2991000000001
