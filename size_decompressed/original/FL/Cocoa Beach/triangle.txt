Very large very slow moving triangle shaped craft, no sound east bound over B-line Expswy between Orlando& Cocoa Bch , June-July 1975;1975-06-15 02:00:00;7min;Very large very slow moving triangle shaped craft, no sound east bound over B-line Expswy between Orlando& Cocoa Bch , June-July 1975 Approx. june-july 1975 heading west on 528 (b-line expressway) 1:00-3:00am approx 1/2 way from Coco Beach to Orlando  myself & passanger encountered 3 large very low flying triangular shaped objects. They flew over us in a southeast path. One almost directly over us with NO sound, almost like a cartoon image moving very slowly.  No traffic was moving in our direction but 3 cars were stopped accross the highway in the east direction.  People were standing outside looking up about 1000' away from us.  Lights flashing from white to light blue with some dark red areas. They were clearly visable for 5 to 7 minutes. Although we were young and open minded at the time, because of the intensity of this encounter, our conversation was limited for the remaining trip.  We called Mcoy Airforce base that morning, they reported no experimental or any other flights in that area that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

The triangle shaped object seemed just a few yards above us, it made no sound, no wind and no lights.;2001-10-20 13:00:00;30 seconds;The triangle shaped object seemed just a few yards above us, it made no sound, no wind and no lights. We were lying on the beach in the early morning, the sky was intermitantly cloudy, but the clouds showed up white or light blue against the night sky, and something made me look up into the sky directly above us.  I noticed a triangle shape moving over us, no sound, no wind, no lights.  It seemed just a few yards above us as big as it was. It moved along rather slowly, although I am a bad judge of speed.  After it passed over us, it continued south for a short while then it just dissapeared.;28.3658569583934;-80.7277760401722
Glowing bluish/green large (same size as a jet but much wider) triangular shaped vehilce flying to the west sky in Cocoa Beach Florida;2007-01-15 20:00:00;5 seconds;Glowing bluish/green large (same size as a jet but much wider) triangular shaped vehilce flying to the west sky in Cocoa Beach Florida Saw just above the treeliine looking to the west a bluish/green large (same size as a jet but much wider) triangular shaped vehilce. The object appeared to be glowing and moving very quickly. After a few seconds, the vehicle took off at a speed I had never seen any flying aircraft move (except in the movies of course). As it flew away, I could barely see traces of its glow.;28.3658569583934;-80.7277760401722
White glowing object flys near Kennedy Space Center at an extreme speed;2013-07-02 21:24:00;3 seconds;White glowing object flys near Kennedy Space Center at an extreme speed Walking on the beach at night this past Tuesday myself and another witness saw an object flying at an extremely high speed (approximately 100 times faster than commercial airlines). It was about the speed of a passing comet.   The object came into view overhead and flew at a 30 degree trajectory coming from the Atlantic Ocean and continued between Port Canaveral and Kennedy Space Center.   There was a mild to moderate overcast at that time which did make it difficult to see the object clearly.  The object itself illuminated the overcast clouds as it passed, you could see that the object was glowing white (almost with a welding light's intensity) with a bluish aura.  There was no tail of light or streaking as is common with comets.   The shape of the light was egg-like with more defined indentions.  I know that Patrick AFB is close by and since this was a vacationing trip my knowledge about the area is limited.   We were standing on Cocoa Beach in front of the Royal Mansions hotel facing port Canaveral.  About 3 minutes after we saw the object we saw a commercial flight passing by heading towards the Atlantic ocean.;28.3658569583934;-80.7277760401722
Triangular craft seen going into outer space over Kennedy Space Center.;2013-07-12 22:30:00;20 minutes;Triangular craft seen going into outer space over Kennedy Space Center. I saw a set of three lights in a triangular form appeared to be evenly spaced between each other.  It slowly rotated clockwise.  It was very high in the sky and appeared to be going into outer space directly above the Kennedy Space Center.   We watched it with our binoculars for around 20 minutes on our dock in our backyard.  It looked like it was goimg straight up.;28.3658569583934;-80.7277760401722
Flying triangle with dim orange light flying over Cocoa Beach, Florida.;2015-09-23 22:00:00;2 minutes;Flying triangle with dim orange light flying over Cocoa Beach, Florida. While standing out on Cocoa Beach, my wife and I saw a triangle shaped object appear and travel up the coast moving at an extremely slow rate of speed.  It had dim orange lights on the bottom of the object.  It passed directly over us and made no sound at all then vanished.   I never believed in U.F.O.'s until last night.  It really startled me.   I worked as a Deputy Sheriff for ten years and now work for the federal government.  I have no reason to lie or make anything up.  I would love to have someone's take on this if they've ever see this object before.;28.3658569583934;-80.7277760401722
