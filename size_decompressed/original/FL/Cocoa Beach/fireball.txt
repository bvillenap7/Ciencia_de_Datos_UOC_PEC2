Orange glow along the horizon;2002-10-22 21:00:00;1 hour;Orange glow along the horizon I was on a late night walk at the beach when I saw a light across the horizon, it was moving back and forth between the Kennedy Space Center and Patrick Air Force Base. The object caught my eye because it was like a redish orange color and it seemed to move as if it was hovering and didn't appear to be a plane. The object moved back and forth many times. I have seen strange lights in the sky before along the same beach and that is why I have decided to post this sighting. I looked in the paper the next day but didn't see any reports although I would think that the people on the Sterling Casino boat would have seen the lights as the boat seemed to be realitivly close to the them.

A round red/orange fireball travelling horizontally.;2014-10-25 20:45:00;1-2 minutes;A round red/orange fireball travelling horizontally. My wife and I witnessed a ufo over the Cocoa Beach, Florida area on Oct. 25, 2014, at approx. 8:45 pm. The accompanying photo was taken from a Samsung Galaxy S4 phone. The object looked like a giant red/orange fireball with no distinct features, travelling horizontally following the shoreline. We observed it for about 1-1/2 minutes. The object appeared to be about 2-3 miles out to sea from the shoreline. The approximate altitude was about 5-7,000 feet. I estimate the speed to be about 100 mph (it was moving about the speed of a helicopter). The object made absolutely no engine noises. The direction of travel was from north to south. Facing the ocean, Cape Canaveral was on our left and Cocoa Beach was behind us and on our right. From our vantage point and distance, the object appeared to be about the size of a hot air balloon. After observing the object for about 1-1 Â½ minutes, it seemed to arc skyward somewhat then disappeared.;28.3658569583934;-80.7277760401722
(2) orange-red fireball orbs appeared over the Atlantic ocean from our east-facing condo balcony.;2015-01-27 20:15:00;10 minutes;(2) orange-red fireball orbs appeared over the Atlantic ocean from our east facing condo balcony Walked out on our condo balcony at approximately 8:15pm on a clear, cool night facing east across the Atlantic Ocean and immediately noticed a bright orange fireball above the horizon line.  The object appeared to be rotating and on fire with alternating colors of bright orange and red.    Then a second light appeared North of the first light at a slightly higher altitude with similar orange-red fireball characteristics.  It's difficult to determine the altitude from the ocean but the distance between the two flaming orbs seemed to be many miles apart.   Then suddenly, the first light faded away from view.   Several minutes later, the second flaming light faded.  The lights seemed to be rotating and on fire.   I saw the entire event from my binoculars.  Unfortunately, I did not record the event.;28.3658569583934;-80.7277760401722
