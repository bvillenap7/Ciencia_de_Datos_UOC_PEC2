Two very bright lights moving across the sky... one slightly lower than the other. Both vanish within a couple of minutes...;1998-03-07 18:00:00;2-5 minutes;Two very bright lights moving across the sky... one slightly lower than the other. Both vanish within a couple of minutes... It was around sunset, the sky was clear, and we were all sitting around on the beach talking when we noticed two very bright lights (like a star, but around sunset) moving slowly across the sky. They were a small distance apart, one slightly lower than the other. They were there for a few minutes, then one suddenly disapeared, followed closely by the second, which lingered for about 20 more seconds, than disapeared as well. Now I've heard many cover up stories to prove that this was no ufo, but I am prepared to give facts towards what I saw. These lights were too high to be airplanes, and they weren't fireworks, missiles from submarines, rockets from Cape Canaveral, or fighter jets issued by Patrick Airforce Base (which is down the road) because it was too high for any of these objects to be. The two lights were brighter than anything I had ever seen in the sky, not to mention there was absolutely no sound whatsoever coming from the objects. They just appeared, moved slowly across the sky, then vanished within a blink of an eye. People across the state as far as Tampa witnessed these lights.;28.3658569583934;-80.7277760401722
Two orange lights over Cocoa Beach (Space Coast) Florida;2007-11-29 03:00:00;approx. 15 seconds;Two orange lights over Cocoa Beach (Space Coast) Florida Late night (early morning) on Cocoa Beach, my girlfriend and I saw two orangish lights fly across the sky. The two lights were at such an altitude that no shape of the UFO's could be determined by our naked eyes (they were about the size of the stars visible in the sky). What made these crafts unusual was the speed at which they were traveling and that, from what we could tell, the crafts were seperate, but traveling together (side-by-side). We only saw the lights for a quick 15 seconds or so and then they were out of sight. There was no noise from the crafts from what we could tell, but note that we were on the beach with waves crashing right at our shoes. Cocoa Beach is very close to Titusville which holds NASA's Kennedy Space Center which only adds to the story. Probably not much of a story for a critic, but it was great fun for me.

Strange orange light moving steady east over Patrick air force base.;2014-12-17 12:00:00;1 minute;strange orange light moving steady east over Patrick air force base. Was going in the back of my uncle's to grab a beer for the neighbor and I , and when I looked past the trees, probably 6 miles south of my location, I saw what I thought was an airplane.   Then, when I went out front to get a better view, I immediately called my neighbor to come out because it had no aircraft lights on it, and was going east on a straight, and slow flight path.  It was a yellowish orange light.  My other neighbor happened to be walking his dogs, and he saw it too.  While we were watching it, all of a sudden it disappeared after a minute.   The weird part, is shortly after the object's disappearance, I saw an airplane with landing lights going in that same direction/flight path as if it were following the light.   I live just north of Patrick Air force base, which may explain the airplane following the light.;28.3658569583934;-80.7277760401722
