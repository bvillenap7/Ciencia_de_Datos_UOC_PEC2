Dimed size sphere object seen offshore near Cocoa Beach;2011-10-17 16:00:00;20 minutes;Dimed size sphere object seen offshore near Cocoa Beach I had just checked into my hotel room around 4pm. I was on the 5th floor and had an ocean view room. The curtains were open in the room.  As I was logging on to my PC, I noticed something moving in the sky out the corner of my eye.  I went out on the balcony and observed (1) sphere looking object hovering and moving very fast, laterally and longitudinally, below and above the clouds over the ocean. The object appeared to be approx. the size and shape of a dime.  The color of the sphere was about the same of the surrounding clouds, not very bright.  The duration was about 20 minutes before disappearing.   I went downstairs into the lobby and out the hotel to see if anyone else observed it.  A looked up and there was a young couple on the 6th floor who were peering in the same direction as the sighting.  I asked them if they had seen what I saw- and they were very excited and said yes, we saw it too.  So I wasnâ€™t seeing things.  I also spent over 20 years in the Air Force, so I know how various aircraft operate, to include weather balloons.  This was not a conventional aircraft, weather balloon, star or satellite.;28.3658569583934;-80.7277760401722
