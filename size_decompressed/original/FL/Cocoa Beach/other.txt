Slow moving shooting star with unnatural light.;2009-01-06 01:00:00;2-4 seconds;Slow moving shooting star with unnatural light. I was lying on the beach with two girls late at night. One of girls had fallen asleep and the other was almost asleep. I was staring straight into the stars for about 20-30 minutes when I saw the event. I was laying on the beach with my feet pointed east (towards the water.)  I looked to the left and saw the beginning of a shooting star.  For the first half a second it seemed like an ordinary shooting star. Then a stream of turquiose light surrounded it.  The stream remained in the sky until the object abruptly cut into the sky.   The stream of light disappeared quickly after the object was out of sight.;28.3658569583934;-80.7277760401722
