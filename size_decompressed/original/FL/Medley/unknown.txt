((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Given that the witnesses observed the object for an estimated 35 minutes, it almost certainly could not have been an aircraft.  It may have been a high-altitude helium balloon at very high altitude, although they generally are not seen to move in the manner the witness describes.  One of two different sighting reports from same witness.  PD));25.8295;-80.2927
