I saw the cigar shaped object that was silver and appeared bigger than the jet that was near by. I at first thought it was the space station so emaied NASA but got no response.  The jet had contrails but the cigar had none.  The plane reflected the sun set and was pinkish but the cigar was not.  It went out of sight  in a blink, not fading from sight but bam, just gone and the plane was still there.  I couldn't get the time in the slot, but it was about 20:00 to 23:00 (8PM)traveling south to north;30.6701;-81.4658
