On October 30, 2007, my friend and I were walking her dog in the neighborhood and observed a light in the night sky that was bright enough to catch our attention at the same time. We both observed the same thing, a light that was getting brighter as time went on and then went dim. We both agreed that it did not appear to be in our atmosphere, it was not tracking or moving in any direction across the sky but appeared to be coming right at us. We stayed outside for another 5 minutes observing the area around us and did not see any other lights other than the occasional aircraft that we see every night. This event has really scared my friend, as she could not understand what it was or how to explain it. We were facing north-northeast and the object appeared to be at about 70Â° in the sky.;30.6701;-81.4658
