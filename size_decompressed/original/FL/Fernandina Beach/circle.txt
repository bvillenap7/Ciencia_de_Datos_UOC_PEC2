Fernandina (Amelia Island) Florida, Circular Object Hovers, Emits Mist from 5 jets to Envelop itself, disappears;2001-06-23 21:45:00;5 min +;Fernandina (Amelia Island) Florida, Circular Object Hovers, Emits Mist from 5 jets to Envelop itself, disappears We were sitting out in the yard, right on beach looking out eastward to sea, myself (M53) and my elderly parents (M87, F74)...Dad says, What is that up there?  I said, it is a plane with its bright landing lights on, for we are very near Fernandina airport and private planes come and go all the time...But it kept on coming toward us and going lower...I would say descending from maybe 5000? to 2000? ft over a minute or two, but absolutely silent.  The trouble was, it was quite a big circle of light, bigger than any star, white w/bluish tinge soft but strong, like florescent light? When it seemed to be about maybe 2000 ft due east of us, over the sea, it just stopped and remained stationary from then on.  At that point its apparent area was about a fifth the size of a full moon in AREA.  Never any sound at all.  After it had hovered like that about a minute, a mist or cloud was emitted by it from what seemed like 3 sources below its midpoint like at 8 6 and 4 o clock, so that the light came to be sitting on a small mist or cloud in the completely clear sky.  This is in the dark of the moon, just a fingernail already setting opposite this in the west.  Then it began to emit the mist or cloud also from vents above it, say at ll and 1 oclock.  Thus it was completely enshrouded in the mist but still the light was there in it so the cloud stood out definitely in the sky for maybe 20 sec.  Then the light was switched off, and the little cloud stood alone in the dark sky.  The size of this cloud was about that of an ellipse with long axis up and down, about what would be covered by a 2 inch or slightly larger cookie held at arms length.  The cloud stood there about 60 sec fading but little, then whoosh, it disappeared in 5 or 10 sec leaving nothing.;30.6701;-81.4658
a bright red falling circle of light;2002-06-16 03:00:00;10 seconds;a bright red falling circle of light It was at 3am on june 16th 2002. i cannot be sure if it was a craft but it was definately non identifiable. i was outside on the side of my house smoking a ciggarette and i was just looking up in the sky. all of the sudden, out of no where, a bright circle of red light began to fall from the sky to the earth. i saw it for about 10 seconds and then it just fell behind some trees. we have an airport in my town and i live very close to it and this object fell in the opposite direstion of the airport. there was no sound or noise made whatsoever.;30.6701;-81.4658
