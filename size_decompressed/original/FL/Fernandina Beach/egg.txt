Two rose-red ovals chase each other 5k feet overhead on straight course, little or no sound.;2005-08-04 22:30:00;90 sec  at most;Two rose-red ovals chase each other 5k feet overhead on straight course, little or no sound. About 10:30 Thurs nite 8-4 as I was sitting in the yard, two aircraft came swift and low and one close on tail of other, from the ocean directly east of me and on straight course about 20 deg S of due W passing south of me and disappearing WSW in about 75? sec horizon to horizon despite elevation only 4 or 5000 ft.  We get lots of helicopters here, but those have flashing piercing red light.  And BIG noise!  These were a dull, rose-red glow, having apparent size (of pea at arms length?), not just a point of light.<P> Coming straight at me, they were like that.   When they pulled up with me, they were like a star, point of white light, but once past, then again a dull rose-red glow color, seemingly about only half as big as they left as they had been on approach.   I doubt the front one was more than a thousand feet  ahead of the back one.   <P>Despite close range, there was no sound at all  ever from the front one, and the back one a sort of  faint dull whoosh-hum began as it passed me and only resolved into a usual jet aircraft sound as it left and was well gone by to the west with me right behind it.<P>   We get a lot of private jets at Fdna airport a mile from here, and this was a very soft, quiet version of a jet engine sound more like would be normal from plane at say 12000 ft going into Jax, or more like a recording of a jet audible mostly when  I was right square behind it.  Front one silent totally.<P>Prefer not to be contacted unless my info critically needed right now.;30.6701;-81.4658
