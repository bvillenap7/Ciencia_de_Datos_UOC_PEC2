Boomerrang-shaped gray gliding metal looking object moving as fast as a small jet had no sound or lights.;2004-10-27 22:00:00;10 seconds;Boomerrang-shaped gray gliding metal looking object moving as fast as a small jet had no sound or lights. My daughter, son, and I had just gotten out of our van to look up at the eclipse but we had to wait for a big mass of cloud to drift by.  While waiting, I was explaining to both of my children what was about to occur when I saw my daughter's face change.  She said,Mom! what's that?  When I turned around to face the moon, I saw a large gray mass moving as fast as a jet with no lights and no sound (like the trailing sound of a airplane engine).  We both watched it glide across the sky appearing and disappearing in the clouds until it finally got out of site.  The shape of it and the way it was gliding made me think that someone was on a hangglider at night.  But I couldn't see any body dangling from the object.  Then I thought, well maybe it's a plane, but again there was no sound from it.  The picture I keep replaying in my mind is that of a stelt boomer looking gray object with circles on the body of it.  The circles reminded me of cheese. It was so large that it had to be between 5 to 10 thousand feet up, well as low as the low moving clouds in the sky.  My son was not paying attention to either one of us until I started asking where's your dad he needs to see this.  By then it was so far off in the distance that my son couldn't get his eyes fixed on it.  I am a health care professional  and probably would not have believed my daughter if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.  Since many people would have been looking up at the dark sky, maybe there are other reports of this sighting.  Please let me know if this was all a misunderstanding and can be easily explained.;25.9409;-80.2453
