Fuzzy teardrop-shaped yellowish-white light streaking over the Atlantic, offshore of Singer Island;2011-09-03 23:30:00;seconds;Fuzzy teardrop-shaped yellowish-white light streaking over the Atlantic, offshore of Singer Island While sitting outside on my front porch that faces due south I saw a flash of heat lightening in the sky to the southeast over the ocean.  Nothing unusual, I see them all the time but then I thought I saw something streaking across the sky at a very fast speed.  So I got up, walked south and was able to visually follow a fuzzy teardrop shaped yellowish-white light streaking across the sky northbound over the ocean at a tremendous rate of speed, faster than any airplane I have ever seen in the sky at night and it had no green or red lights.  I have never seen anything like this before.  I was curious if others had seen this so I googled white streak of light singer island and just happened on this website.;26.7752;-80.0513
