Bright full moon and clouds with yellow light behind one cloud turning cloud yellow orange. Nearby clouds were full of holes. I have photos.  Yellow light emerged from cloud became orange with no movement.  I had been photographing the moon and camera had a flash.  Orange light over the ocean began moving toward us .  We were on our patio looking east toward the ocean.  It picked up speed and came right toward us. Became a hazy orange circle and hovered right over us for 2 seconds then sdisappeared over our patio and an incredible speed.  I have photos of it hiding behind a cloud and the clouds with holes in them.  No sound.  Flew over Singer Island Fl east to west.;26.7752;-80.0513
