Twirling oval black thing dissapeared beneath the tree tops;2008-10-09 01:00:00;10 seconds;Twirling oval black thing dissapeared beneath the tree tops I'm not exactly sure what I saw but I saw something that my mind can't make sense out of. I was driving south on 41 around a long turn.  About a quarter mile into the forest I noticed a large, oval-shaped dark object slowly flipping and descending.  I thought it was some sort of weather balloon being dragged down by some very thin ropes. It was oval shaped and twirled like a clock.  It was very dark.  I couldn't really make out what it was at all, despite its size.  I watched it for about 10 seconds as it slowly hid out of sight beneath the tree tops.  I was in a hurry to get somewhere but it really caught my attention.  But the more I think about this the less sense it makes. This is a very small and predictable town.  Perhaps it was nothing extraordinary.  I really don't know what to make out of it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
