A couple of my relatives were over earlier this evening before the event took place.  While standing outside saying goodbye, my younger nephew was screaming.  So instinctively my family and i wanted to know what was wrong. That is when we all noticed what he was pointing at.  I, myself was very shocked and breath taken, do not believe of other life being on distant planets.  But this event shocked the hell out of me and is making me re-think. What we saw-a purple-ish blue figure in the sky twirling in a box like motion.  It made no sounds and gave us all an ominous feeling in the guts of our stomachs.  It lasted about 25-30 seconds before it dissociated from as far as we could see. Long story short, very very freaky. P.S.--We do not have any airports near by, and where i reside is made up of a community of senior citizens.;28.8359939086296;-82.2897751269041
