Orange fireball (?) over Inverness, FL night sky;2009-04-03 20:30:00;3 minutes;Orange fireball (?) over Inverness, FL night sky My husband and I were driving east in hwy 44 into Inverness with our daughter in the car as well. We were right in front of the Super Walmart when I saw an orange glowing object in the sky. My husband had seen the exact same thing a week ago when he was by himself. I asked him if that was what he saw and he said YES!!. We watched it as we drove and it appeared to be either traveling away from us or was getting dimmer. It got smaller and smaller then eventually faded out, popped back on for a brief second then was gone. There was a slight haze around it just before it went out. It was a crystal clear night so it didn't go behind any clouds. When we first saw it it looked about the size of a street light off in the distance, but was up too high to be a street light. It also did not have any other colors or flashing lights but a bright orange glow. We did see an airplane flying the opposite direction shortly after, but you could clearly tell that was an airplane as it had flashing lights.;28.8359939086296;-82.2897751269041
Fireball, slow moving and completely silent;2020-06-13 23:00:00;30 seconds;Fireball, slow moving and completely silent To whom it may concern: Saturday, June 13th about 11 pm Inverness, Florida. My wife and I were sitting by the pool when she seen something unusual and asked me if I seen it. I turned and there was a large fireball  moving slowly from the north  and turning west. It appeared to be about 500 feet above the trees and was completely silent. We went inside and told our 15 year old daughter Sierra, (aka Digit),  and our 50 year old son, Tony what we had seen. My wife (Amanda) and daughter went back outside, Tony wanted me to show him where we had seen it so we went outside also. It had been about ten minutes since we first seen the Fireball when it appeared again. Sierra took a picture with her phone and Tony and I started videoing with our phones.  It came from the north as before and again turned and went west. I posted the picture and video on my Facebook page as did Tony, the fireball was much bigger than it appeared in the video. I’m not at all sure what we saw, but I know what it wasn’t… It was not phosphorus, a weather balloon, gas, fireworks, helicopter, or SpaceX. After telling a few friends I now understand why some people are reluctant to mention it. Had I seen the picture and video we posted I would have thought it to be fake. This statement is true and witnessed by the four of us. PLEASE TEXT BEFORE YOU CALL SO I DO NOT BLOCK YOUR NUMBER;28.8359939086296;-82.2897751269041
