Small fireball like object hovering over a water treatment plant I North Miami, FL;2002-12-10 22:15:00;45 Seconds;Small fireball like object hovering over a water treatment plant I North Miami, FL In the back of FIU campus in North Miami Beach lays a water treatment center, above that center some students and I saw a fireball like object rotating then sped out and disappeared. It looks like the aurora when it disappeared but of course in Florida we don’t have an aurora. We also notice after the object disappeared it left this very cold smelly fume like air with fainted colors as if you would to throw a little bit of water on some gasoline. The distance between where we were standing to the object was about 2 blocks away. The object was about 2000 feet up I think it was pretty high though an we where able to get enoughe detail to say it's not a Helicopter or some student’s science project;25.8906;-80.1784
