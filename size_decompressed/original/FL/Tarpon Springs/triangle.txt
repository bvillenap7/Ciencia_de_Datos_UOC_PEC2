Tarpon Springs Small Triangle Craft.;2017-01-12 19:30:00;3 minutes;Tarpon Springs Small Triangle Craft. It was a clear sky. Object was the size of a Cessna plane and flew 200ft up.  We noticed it as I was driving on US 19 SB approaching alternate 19 to turn right.  Before I turned I got a good look at it.  It looked ominous and had no solid red or green FAA light.  It had 1 bright red light that pulsed up and down and I saw 3 tiny red lights in a row on the edge of the craft.  As I made the turn and drove away from US 19 on Alt 19, it flew by again was a little higher up and I lost sight of it driving.;28.1389740554156;-82.7486521410585
