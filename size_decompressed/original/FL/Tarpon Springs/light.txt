Small, white, fast moving light in sky for 5 seconds.;2007-10-26 20:30:00;5 seconds;Small, white, fast moving light in sky for 5 seconds. I was sitting lower than my 12 year old daughter (she was standing) about 20 feet from a campfire... she was asking me something.  My attention was diverted to a light on the sky... it was small, white, and silent.  It was below a pretty low cloud cover so I was impressed by the absents of sound.  It was moving quickly, like a meteor, so it traveled a large distance in just 5 seconds.  It then made a 90 degree turn straight up through the cloud cover, illuminated the cloud cover slightly and was gone.  I asked my daughter if she saw that, and she acted like I was trying to scare her because we were at a Halloween party.  When I explained to her what I saw, she knew instantly that I was not lying. No one else was involved or believed me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));28.1389740554156;-82.7486521410585
Opposing, pulsating lights, begin to rotate, then turn into a solid ring of light then disappear.;2016-09-08 06:00:00;20 seconds;Opposing, pulsating lights, begin to rotate, then turn into a solid ring of light then disappear. every early morning, I take my dog outside to start the day. on clear days, I enjoy searching the heavens for a glimpse of a shooting star. I was observing the early morning star formations in the eastern sky as I do every morning between 5:45 - 6:45. The sky was very clear with no clouds or aircraft visible. As I looked up at about 15 degrees, I observed a single star which appeared to be of great distance due to it's brightness. Then I observed first one light to the right of the star that suddenly appeared and was pulsating at a slow interval. It was not like a strobe light of an aircraft. Then 180 degrees to the left of it, another light starting pulsating. both lights then began to pulsate faster until the flashing became a constant light with no intervals. They then began to rotate opposite of each other in a 360 degree rotation, first slowly, then faster and faster until the lights appeared as a single ring. Then suddenly there was complete darkness. ! I just stared at the spot where I witnessed these lights for some minutes later, somewhat dumbfounded at what I had just observed. I am an Quality Engineering Manager for a microwave communication components manufacturer. I have worked in the aerospace industry for almost 40 yrs. I know aircraft and I know satellites and these lights were not from either types of equipment. I have never seen anything like what I have witnessed this morning. It appeared to be definitely outside our atmosphere, mush higher than satellites I have seen from the sun's light reflecting on their sides as they streak across the sky in their obit. What I have witnessed this morning was certainly not man made and it has been a really shocking event for me. After all these years, I was still not convinced there was any real legitimate UFO sightings until this morning. It's totally a game changer !;28.1389740554156;-82.7486521410585
