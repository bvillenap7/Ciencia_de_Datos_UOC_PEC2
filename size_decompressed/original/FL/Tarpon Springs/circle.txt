Ball of fire observed in sky.;2011-07-07 00:00:00;2 Minutes;Ball of fire observed in sky. On the night of July 7th 2011 at approximately 12:28 am, I observed a single ball of fire in the sky heading in a East to West direction in Tarpon Springs, Florida (Pinellas county), with myself looking in a southeast direction.  This occurred in front of my house upon returning from my boyfriend's house. Initially, I believed that it was an aircraft but upon further observation the object was bright and orange/red in color which had the appearance of fire that pulsated the object did not leave a trail or change color.  I observed the object for approximately 2 minutes.  At first, the object was cruising along until I began to film it.  At that point, the object slowed but kept traveling West.  Eventually, the object slowed to a stop, began to ascend into the sky and finally faded from view.;28.1389740554156;-82.7486521410585
