3 fireballs.  ((anonymous report));2019-05-04 03:00:00;2 minutes;3 fireballs I saw one bright orangish-red (what we thought to be) a fireball shooting through the sky and then it dimmed out after a few seconds.   Right afterwards I saw two more fireballs, close together.  They lit up the sky the same bright color and then one looked like it exploded, and then smoke emitted as it fizzled out.   The third one seemed to stay lit for a couple of minutes, but I drove off before seeing it fizzle out.   Iâ€™ve never seen anything like it before, much less three.
