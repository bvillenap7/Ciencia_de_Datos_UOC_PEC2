Stationary cylinder-shaped UFO seen in clear daylight.;2000-11-11 14:35:00;10 minutes;Stationary cylinder-shaped UFO seen in clear daylight. I was sitting on a sidewalk bench, scanning the sky.  I noticed at about 70 degrees up in the Northwest a fixed object.  I watched it for at least 7 minutes and it never moved.  It was barely discernable to be like a cylinder, about the size of a grain of rice held at arms length. If you took a pencil and cut the eraser and the metal thing that holds it, that is the proportion.  The sky was clear blue.  I shifted my gaze several times and  even looked away to attempt to get my wife to come out of a shop she was in there.  Each time I expected it to 'be gone' and not physical.  I fixed it over nearby landmarks and it never moved. Slowly, a small puffy cloud came from the  east and covered the object.  As the cloud moved on, the object had disappeared.;28.1389740554156;-82.7486521410585
