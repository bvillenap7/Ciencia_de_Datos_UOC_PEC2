A totally mysterious solid puff of dim light traveled across the sky.;2004-10-05 20:10:00;10-12 seconds;A totally mysterious solid puff of dim light traveled across the sky. It was dark outside and I was sitting in my window-tinted car.  I saw something move steadily across my window glass and then I rolled my window.  At first I thought I saw a plane flying through a cloud.  It looked like a light source was illuminating the inside and outside of a cloud.  It had a slight double trail of light.  The shape (of the light) and color never changed which made me confused.  It was moving across the horizon much faster than any plane.  It was declining in elevation steadily as it moved across the sky. In about ten seconds it went from the top of my field of view to behind a bright streetlamp.  The object wasn't very bright and the light from the streetlamp made me lose focus of the object.  That's it.  So here's the summery.  A solid puff of dim light traveled across the sky.  I never have seen an object like it or anything that moves like it.  I don't believe in flying saucers from outer space but I have no idea what I saw.  To me a UFO is an Unidentified Flying Object and that's what I saw.   POSTSCRIPT:  I was looking into the East.  The object moved from North East to South East.  It declined about 20 degrees throughout my sighting.;28.1389740554156;-82.7486521410585
Faint star moves across night sky.;2014-04-26 21:45:00;1 minutes;Faint star moves across night sky. I thought it was a faint star just east of the incredibly bright body in the eastern sky.  When I noticed it, I thought it moved.  I then watched it continue to move using 2 stars as reference points.  It continued moving until it passed between the 2 stars and finally left my site.  Is it possible what I saw was nasa's unmanned X37 moving in orbit?  A satellite wouldn't be visible to the naked eye would it?  I've been watching the night sky more this week because of the 2 very bright celestial bodies.  I have also witnessed 3 aircraft that I have never seen before, within an hour of each other, headed the same direction.  All 3 were flying lower than normal, made less noise than expected, and wingspans didn't seem great enough. I couldn't see any of the body of the aircraft.  Each had 3 to 4 rows of white lighted squares on the bottom, under the cockpit, which made it look flat underneath.  A single round white light on what should be the wingtips, this is how I gauged wingspan, and 2 rectangular white lights at the center of what should be the tail.  Again, I couldn't see the bodies of said aircraft with exception to the lighted squares toward the nose.  Any insight into what these sightings are or might be would be very helpful.;28.1389740554156;-82.7486521410585
