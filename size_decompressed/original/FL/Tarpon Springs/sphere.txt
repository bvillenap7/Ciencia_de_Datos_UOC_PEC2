NOT THE MOON     NOT THE SUN;2011-11-04 17:13:00;seconds;NOT THE MOON     NOT THE SUN I saw the clouds go dark. Then from underneath the clouds the sun, but round and silver blindingly bright. It was in 12  oclock position.  I was in middle of a conversation on the phone at work in my office building.  I happened to see the time and mentioned it to the client on the line.   After the conversation, I said to myself, wow the moon is really large and full. I left work at 7pm tonight and when I got out expecting an full moon, it was only about 1/3 of the moon.  This when it struck me. What I thought was the sun, but looked like the moon was in the wrong place in the sky for 5 pm and it was a silver white light, not golden red and orange sunlight.  Could this have been the decent of an huge ship using the rolling like smoke from a fire clouds to conceal the decent?
