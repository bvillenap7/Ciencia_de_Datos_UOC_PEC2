As I was driving down Keystone Road on the north side of Lake Tarpon a grey saucer shaped object flew across the roadway above a set of high tension electric wires.The craft came in from the north and headed south toward the lake. The day was clear and there were very few clouds in the sky by this time. It was fairly low in the sky and from its path it looked as though it was headed toward the water. Unfortunately from my position on the road I could not see the lakefront.;28.1389740554156;-82.7486521410585
