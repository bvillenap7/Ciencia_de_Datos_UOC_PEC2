The UFO changed shape just before it turned north.  No sound at all.  It looked like it was about 30 Degrees off the horizon, and maybe 1-2 miles away.  I have PICTURES that I took with my cell phone, very clear.  This is a REAL sighting.  Hope you find it interesting.  Would be happy to tex you photos....Thanks;27.1592099236642;-80.2161832061069
