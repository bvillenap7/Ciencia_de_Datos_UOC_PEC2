not sure what i saw;2005-10-05 02:00:00;2 hours;not sure what i saw I was looking into the sky and saw a light traveling across.  It seemed to fast to be a plane but too slow to be a meteor.  I pointed it out to my friend and we layed back in my truck and just started to watch the sky.  After a few minutes another appeared out of the same direction (all came from the north and headed south) headed straight for a while and just disappeared.  We saw about 15 in all, some made very erratic movements, nothing ive seen a plane ever do, nor do I think a plane could do.  I could not make out a description of what the aircraft looked like but judging by the movements I dont think it was your ordinary run of the mill plane.;27.1592099236642;-80.2161832061069
brightly lit object leaving flame trail with directional and speed change before vanishing;2007-11-10 20:30:00;1 1/2 min.;brightly lit object leaving flame trail with directional and speed change before vanishing a bright yellow-orange object appeared to enter the  atmosphere moving from north to south, several miles offshore over the atlantic with a flaming trail....the flame trail disappeared and a smoke trail was visible as the object slowed but maintained horizontal flight....then the oject itself glowed briefly but intensely from orange to a bright yellow-white and abruptly increased in speed and changed direction and headed east to southeast, and the light disappeared instantly.....this object initially looked like a meteor, but after only a few seconds of viewing it became obvious that it was not, since it changed direction and speed and was visible for at least 90 seconds.....this is a fairly populated area on the east coast of florida, so i don't think we are the only ones to have seen this object;27.1592099236642;-80.2161832061069
1 object entering our atmoshpere at amazing speeds suddenly stopped in mid fall, then 2 more objects came out of first one;2009-11-13 18:45:00;5 minuts;1 object entering our atmoshpere at amazing speeds suddenly stopped in mid fall, then 2 more objects came out of first one AT 6:45 pm on highway 95 going south bound in stuart Florida...me and my father (who was driving) saw what looked like a meteor breaking through our atmosphere with a large fire tail, estamated to be 1 mile long.  It was of course falling very rapidly on a vertical angle.  Then it began to break apart into 3 seprate peices i thought it was just breaking up in the atmosphere but the peices did not change color or size or dim down.  then all three peices immediatly stopped rapidly falling in only a second.  They stopped on a perfact diagnal line.  Then they gradually started moving slowly at the same speed on a horazontle direction.  Then the bottom (lowest to the ground) lights began to desend towrds the ground, but the top one stopped moving and hovered oner the treeline for about a minut.  Then all three objects immediatly vanished from the sky.  There were no flashing lights on any of the objects.;27.1592099236642;-80.2161832061069

Within 3to 5 minutes another amber light appeared in the north,northwest sky for another short period this time heading south,southeast.Within another 10 minutes 2 more flyig amber light appeared in the sky @ the approximate  same altitue, maybe 1 to2 thousand feet they also disappeared within 5 to 7 minutes. There was never any sound associated with movement.;27.1592099236642;-80.2161832061069
