Something big full of smoke and lights fell from the sky.;2017-12-05 18:45:00;Seconds;Something big full of smoke and lights fell from the sky. Me and my mother were in the car and from the stop light on the road on Indian St.  we could see in the distance something big falling from the sky,  it had yellow, red, green lights and there was a tail behind it,  it seemed pretty big even though it was probably 8 miles away from us.  I think it was an asteroid but...there was some green light so..?  I don't know what it was.  It seemed like it exploded in midair.  It was way too big to be a firework, and there was NO sound.;27.1592099236642;-80.2161832061069
Red glowing shere in Stuart, FL 4th of July 9:07PM.;2018-07-04 21:07:00;2 minutes;Red glowing shere in Stuart, FL 4th of July 9:07PM As another report south of Stuart, FL, we also saw the slow moving glowing and pulsing red sphere.  We were outside for forth of July when I saw the object moving north.  I ran inside to grab my phone, came out and video'd the rest of the sighting for about 2 minutes.   After a minute more it shot off extremely fast north east towards the ocean in which seconds later was no longer visible due to distance.;27.1592099236642;-80.2161832061069
