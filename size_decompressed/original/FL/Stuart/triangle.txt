Triangular shaped craft over Sewals point . Stuart, Fl;2011-04-24 22:30:00;4 minutes;Triangular shaped craft over Sewals point . Stuart, Fl Driving home after dropping off a freind of my 12 year old son.  Looked up in sky and saw a large Triangular Craft with 3 white to amber shifting lights on all 3 tips.  Object looked like the bottom side of an iron  We pulled over and got out of car to observe the craft hovering at about 4000ft. craft was completely silent absolutely no navigation, strobe lights or rotating red beacon on craft.   After observing craft for 3-4 minutes it suddenly accelerated to incredible speeds and was out of site within 5-7 seconds.  I have never seen anything like this in my life. i would estimate that craft accelerated from a total standstill to at least 2500-3000 mph to dissapear in the amount of time it took it to accelerate over the horizon and out of site.   this was not an aircraft or sattelite.;27.1592099236642;-80.2161832061069
