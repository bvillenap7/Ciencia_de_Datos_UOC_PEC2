Bright light appearing suddenly....then a large saucer like craft with a tranlucent like skin appeared over our head!;1999-11-14 04:30:00;20-30 minutes;Bright light appearing suddenly....then a large saucer like craft with a tranlucent like skin appeared over our head! Like someone turned on a light switch in the night sky. A bright white light appeared in the sky and we watched it for several minutes. We were unsure if it was a bright star or an airplane's landing lights..but it didn't twinkle like a star and seemed to hover and move side to side ways and exhibited strange characteristics unlike any other light source...natural or man-made. It was easy to see it was imminating from the bottom of the object since the glare was directed downward. As we questioned it's origins it responded by gyrating in circles...kind of like a spinning top when it starts to wobble. Then like a flash the object responded to our curiosiy in it's size and in an instant went from being a bright light in the distance to a large craft(maybe a half mile in diameter)...it is at this point that I grabbed my girlfriend and started to run like hell! Terrified I turned to look over my shoulder, at the same time the Craft jumped back up into sky and dissapeard behind some clouds. As I looked over my shoulder one last time I saw the same bright white light popping in and out from behind some clouds. We got in the car and started home...but our curiosity got the best of us and we went back to see if it was still there.  When we returned the sky was very dark...we could hear a very lo pitched hum and smelled an odd burning scent like fuel but not gasoline. We were so terrified we haven't been back since. What was this?? PLEASE HELP!;27.1592099236642;-80.2161832061069

Ten bright orbs light up quiet Stuart, FL neighborhood;2020-05-30 20:49:00;2 minutes;Ten bright orbs light up quiet Stuart, FL neighborhood At 8:49pm on Saturday, May 30th in Stuart, FL as I walked my dog near the corner of Cortez Ave and Osceola Street, I saw ten red-orange orbs in the sky.  They were in a loose formation and moved/hovered slowly – until they didn’t when they simply seemed to blink out of sight.  I saw one of the objects move lower then laterally prior to blinking out of sight.  The whole sighting only lasted about 2 minutes.  I got a video of 45 seconds of the sighting.  The video is blurred at times because my dog kept yanking on my arm.  I also have a fairly clear photo of one of the objects.;27.1592099236642;-80.2161832061069
