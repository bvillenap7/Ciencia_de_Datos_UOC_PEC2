I just plugged in fireballs in sky over Stuart in my search box to see if there was anything on the news about what I had just seen. I wondered if people sky dive at night and use flares to land. The glow that I saw was too big and pulsating to be that. It didn't have any nav lights, the red and green lights on the wing tips of a plane. I didn't see any particular formation. The lights followed each other with a good deal of separation. When shooting stars fizzle out they would seem to be traveling a lot faster than these strange orbs, and would have fizzled out before I lost sight.
