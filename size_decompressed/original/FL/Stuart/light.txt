While traveling south on the Florida Turnpike approaching mile marker 128, Wednesday evening, May 5, at around 10:00 p.m. my sister and I observed two very bright white lights. This is near the Stuart/ Jupiter Island area. They were in a stationary position slightly above horizan and directly ahead of us when I first observed them . Through my binoculars one light appeared larger and slightly lower than the other. No shape or supporting structure was visible. There were several cellphone towers in the vicinity. The lights appeared three times higher than the towers and remained fixed as we approached  and drove directly under them. At this point the larger light seemed to be one fourth the size of the moon with the other slightly smaller. They were very close together. There were no flashing lights. As we passed them I looked out the rear window and found nothing. I am most interested in finding a logical explanation for what we saw. As an experienced birdwatcher I frequently observe the skies and feel confident I've never seen anything like this. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found here to be exceptionally objective and credible.  We suspect she is a very good witness.  PD));27.1592099236642;-80.2161832061069
bright light over;2008-12-18 16:55:00;30 seconds or less;bright light over I was waiting at the stoplight at the intersection of Kanner Highway (SR 76) and Federal Highway (US 1) facing south.  I saw a bright light in the distance to the south (probably several miles away at least) moving from west to east and at about a 30 degree angle toward the ground.  It moved in a straight line at high speed.  I saw it straight ahead then lost sight of it behind a building on the SE corner of the intersection then briefly saw it again moving in the same apparent direction and speed before losing sight of it entirely behind buildings & trees.;27.1592099236642;-80.2161832061069
