No lights, circle object, about 20 in diameter, floating on building.;2001-07-01 23:00:00;10 Seconds;No lights, circle object, about 20 in diameter, floating on building. This event happened about 3-4 years ago (2000/2001)... I live in a 3-story building that is shaped like the letter C. Imagine putting a dot in the middle of the C, that's where the building's pool would be.  It was about 11pm and I was in the pool and my aunt was visiting and my father and her were on the pool deck talking... As I was swimming around the pool I looked up at the sky somewhere above the building and then I looked away. For a second I thought I saw something so I looked again. This was really akward. It was a pretty coudy night and the sky was colored light/dark grey. I look above the building and I see a circle. It had no lights and it made no sound and it looked like it had a diameter of about 15-20 feet, it was pretty big. It was a circle and it looked like it was floating about 10-20 feet above the building. It was just a pitch-black circle. I couldn't identify any textures or features that it had. It was just a dark, floating circle.  I tried to get my father and my aunt to look but until I got their attention and until they looked, it was gone. I've been wondering about this for a long time. I want to know if anyone has seen anything like this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));25.9823;-80.1405
