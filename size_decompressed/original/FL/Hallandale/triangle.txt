It was a silver/gray color but not very shiny hovering over us. It began move up and down and there was no sound. Then it started to move backwards and forwards with ease. the triangle was the larger then a jet but just smaller then a blimp.  Just before it's dissappearance, it began making noises.  Very low bellowing noises, kind of like a whale. The noises became louder and louder while we covered our ears.  It kept getting louder until it dissappeared.;25.9823;-80.1405
