I'm testing a new digital camera and from my balcony I took some pictures yesterday of a plane, today I did the same until I saw this unusual light coming over the ocean to my east, from south to north very bright, I did manage to take 3 pictures, but they look like dots in the photo.;25.9823;-80.1405
Sighting of between 17 to 20 well defined points of light and one that was three times the size of the others moving right to left.;2012-03-24 18:50:00;5 to 7 minutes;a sighting of between 17 to 20 well defined points of light and one that was three times the size of the others moving right to left. At about 6:45 to 6:50 EDT in the south eastern sky I saw approximately 17 to 20 well defined points of light. They were moving slowly toward the north at a slow rate of speed.  One of the lights was about 3 times the size of the others.  They were in an irregular formation.  At first I thought they were stars, but it was clearly too light out.  They continued to move slowly northward for about 5 to 7 minutes, then they faded from sight, maybe climbing too high to be seen at all.  The larger light stayed stationary when it was directly overhead and when all the small ones were gone the larger light disappeared.;25.9823;-80.1405
