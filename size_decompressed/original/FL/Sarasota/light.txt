3 gold balls gather, split to 5 and disappear!;1969-06-01 12:00:00;10 seconds?;3 gold balls gather, split to 5 and disappear! Sarasota, Florida summer 1968 or 69  Beautiful day, some clouds, I'm standing waist deep out in the gulf, looking back towards shore. There are other people, trees, houses ect on the shoreline. Over the tops of the trees, I see a glowing gold orb, ball shaped, but no way to tell the size, not very big from my vantage point, but very bright.. It sort of darted around some, and then 2 more glowing gold balls showed up. They all went together in one spot, 2 of them went to the 3rd one, but it didnt get bigger. But when they were all in one spot, after less than a few seconds, all of the  sudden, 5 split off in different directions up and away, very fast, and were gone. Whole thing took less than 10 seconds. I can still see the relative scene, but I never could decide how big they were, or how far away. It seems I was rather far out in the water, that area is very flat and you can go 100 yds or more out in the gulf and not be in very deep. The shoreline was very far away as I recall, at least 100 yards. NO one else seemed to have noticed, and I dont remember anything after that. Sure do remember it tho! They really glowed, and were very golden colored. didnt pulse. Darted around like a hummingbird does, zip zip, back and forth, up and down, nothing we have can do that even now really. It was totally cool and I wish I could see more stuff like that.!!;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
Observed 2 lights, one staggered lower and to the right, East of Sarasota, FL.;1998-03-07 18:48:00;90 seconds;Observed 2 lights, one staggered lower and to the right, East of Sarasota, FL. My wife and I were coming back from watching the sunset at the beach. During that time we had a conversation about the lack of clouds making for very little color in the sunset.  As we left the beach and were traveling East on Siesta Drive, my wife noticed two very bright lights in the NE sky.  At this point we were at the intersection of  Siesta Drive and Midnight Pass.  The objects were roughly about 2 o'clock in the sky.  The lights were blurry as if being seen through a mist or a fog.  The didn't move at all, just blinked twice and were no longer there. Hope this helps. Paul Kaiser ((NUFORC:  Probable missile launch.));27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151

Bright White Light appearing over Sarasota;2006-10-24 17:38:00;10-15 seconds;Bright White Light appearing over Sarasota My boyfriend (Sales Manager) and I(((deleted)) Specialist) were walking to our car after leaving PetSmart.  We were facing east.   Both of us were looking at the sky, at a pair of contrails that were running north/south parallel to each other.   He jokingly said Look, UFO trails.   As soon as the words came out of his mouth, a faint white light started appearing between the two contrails, looking like it was flickering on kind of like the flicker of a fluorescent bulb.   I thought it was the first star of the evening, but was proved wrong when the light grew steadily brighter.  It grew into a bigger, intensely bright white light and shone like that for about 3 seconds.   Then, the light flickered again and it was gone.  No trace of it.   There were no contrails coming off of it, it was too far away to tell if there was any sound, and there were no blinking lights like on an airplane or helicopter.  It just disappeared.   We were facing East, and I would say that it appeared to be over I-75 or a little farther east of the interstate.  It was really high up in the sky with the contrails, so, I'm guessing it was at airplane altitude.   At this point in the evening, the sun had set behind the building we were in front of.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151

white twin lights, sarasota florida, june 27, 2007;2007-06-24 23:50:00;2 minutes;white twin lights, sarasota florida, june 27, 2007 My husband and I were returning home from a late movie.  As we were leaving the car, we both looked into the sky.  I'm not sure why we looked.  It was very clear, with a few scattered clouds.  You could see the stars so clearly.  We both noticed a light from the west, hazy, like seen through clouds, except most of the sky was clear, it was joined by another.  The one continued on in a fairly straight path and disappeared.  The second circled for nearly 2 minutes fairly irregularly.  My first thought was that it was a spot light aimed at the clouds, but there were so FEW clouds.  It didn't go in a perfect circle either, nearly in an oval, but not always the same.  It was very strange, and like nothing either of us has seen or even ever heard about.  What a blessing to see such an amazing thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Cannot be due to STS-117 and ISS.  The former landed on June 22, 2007.  PD));27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151

Large red pulsing light over Sarasota, Florida.;2011-12-09 23:32:00;5 minutes;Large red pulsing light over Sarasota, Florida. Sitting on my sofa watching TV, I noticed a very bright red light in the sky. It was gaining altitude  and the red light was pulsing.  I did not hear any noise. The red pulsing light was very bright and large even though it was not directly above my house.  When I saw it it seemed to move towards my house and then changed directions and moved in a north western direction.  It moved quickly away and the light dimmed and went out.  About 2 minutes later saw it again and in the same exact pattern, first moving up or gaining altitude as it moved towards my house and then away.  My son and I went outside and heard no noise at all. Then the light just went out suddenly we waited a few seconds then returned inside. A  few minutes later the entere event was repeated. This time we quickly went out and my son recorded the light. After watching the recording we realized there were two lights in the video. We did not see any shape other then the round red light.  It is very dark behind our house at night and the light was not directly over my house.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
Orange light seen in sky North of Sarasota, FL;2012-01-20 19:30:00;15 minutes;Orange light seen in sky North of Sarasota, FL I was walking my daughter’s dog at about 7-7:30 pm on Friday evening (01/20/2012) in Sarasota, FL. We were walking toward the North when I looked up at the sky and noticed an orange something approximately 45 degrees off of the horizon in the sky. My first thought was that Mars was looking orange tonight, but I realized that whatever I was seeing was not Mars.  It was, however, about the same brightness as the planet Venus in the night sky. I then thought I had never seen an orange light on any plane (as I live quite close to the local airport) and did not see any flashing lights on this.  I did see aircraft in the area shortly thereafter. I stopped walking to determine if it was moving at all, as it did not seem to be while we walked.  I and the dog stopped for about 30 seconds, but the object did not appear to change position. I then thought we would go back to the house so I could get my binoculars so I could get a better look at it. We had walked about halfway back to the house (making sure I kept my eye on the object) when it just faded out.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
Bright neon green orb seen descending.;2012-04-07 03:00:00;3 seconds;Bright neon green orb seen descending. I am a college student in Sarasota, Florida. I saw a ufo, similar to some of the other ones witnessed in other parts of Florida reported on this site: http://www.ufosnw.com/sighting_reports/2011/westpalmbeachfl07272011/westpalmbeachfl07272011.htm  It was a greenish orb.  I am an art student, and I made an animation that closely resembles what I saw. I believe I replicated what I saw with about 85% accuracy. I saw it clearly, and remember it clearly, but it occurred no more than 3 seconds, so that's why I believe it to be about 85% accurate.  Anyways, here's what happened: Last Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, around 3 am, I was driving from school to my apartment. I was wide awake. The road was dark-there are no road lamps. Up far ahead are plazas that have lighting but it was a mile ahead. As I drove, a bright light caught my attention I could see it to the right through my windshield. It was circular and orb-like, and it was a bright light. Most of it was neon green, with a bright white center, but I could see cyan blue towards the bottom right of the light. The orb descended towards the ground in a smooth curved path. It descended rather fast, but not fast enough that it appeared to be falling. It had no tail like a falling meteorite, and it made no noise. It was consistently orb-like. Eventually, it was obscured by tall dark trees.  I tried to figure out what it was. At first I thought that it might of been some sort of creature/bird/insect that was close to a light and reflected bright light. However, there are no lights or road lamps around the area. Wherever the orb descended to it was in wild pine forestry. Second, I thought that perhaps a light from a car or some nearby building reflected on my windshield but after observing my windshield for days, I could see that my windshield does not reflect any light-only car door windows reflect light. The orb was way too bright and crystal clear to be a reflection either way. I also thought of it possibly being a meteor, but it has no tail-years before I had witnessed a rather large bright blue and loud meteor burn in the sky and they are not identical at all. It could not have been a helicopter because the light was extremely neon green and slightly blue at the bottom, and it was too large to be a helicopter I would've heard it if it was that close. It wa! s also moving too fast to be any man-made craft. In conclusion, it's nothing I've seen and nothing I can explain.  As an illustration student, I just HAD to replicate what I saw. I made an animation to show the speed and path of the orb, the colors and brightness as accurate as I remember, and how high it was and how far away it was. I hope my illustrations will help in whatever investigations or studies your organization does. If you have further questions, feel free to email me. I'll be sending the graphics as soon as I submit this form.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151

We were setting up a fire when we took a moment to look at the beautifully clear sky. The sun had just set when we saw the first ball of light. We saw 7 total ufos total but not all at once. They stayed in one place and kind of looked like stars. The first one we saw headed south west increasing in speed but then dimmed away.  The second came from the east heading west, it started off as what looked like a star but then started moving but not very fast, as it was moving another one came from the west crossed paths with the 2nd one and then blinked 2 times then split into 2 balls of light and kept going.  The 4th one we saw looked like a star but then got really bright.  Then it started moving down ward towards earth getting brighter.  It had whisker like light coming off the sides, the way something fall to earth would look but it then dimand Down and merged with a star andnever moved.  The whole time there was alot of holiday traffic in the sky which helped us ! know with out a doubt. The what we saw were not planes!  About ten min.  Past since we saw the 4th one when the 5th one appeared.  This one was directly over head I looked like it split from something and then flew south. Then the craziest one came the 6th one.  As if came in from the south going north it would blink but not in a pattern just randomly but when it did blink other stars would blink as it would go past. The 7th came from the north and headed south. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151

Unexplained light in night sky changes color before disappearing.;2013-02-20 21:00:00;4 minutes;Unexplained light in night sky changes color before disappearing. Earlier this year I had a sighting of an aerial object from my house was mthat aybe not so incredible, but unexplained nonetheless. This sighting took place at approximately 9pm from my home in Sarasota, Florida. I was outside on my deck talking on the phone with a friend when I spotted an unusaul white light in the night sky at just about a 45 degree angle traveling at a slow, steady speed, at what looked like a linear path approaching me from the South in a North or Northeast heading. This light was about the size of a pencil eraser or around 3x the size of the brightest star Sirius, but not as brilliant.  I asked my friend if he could see anything and he confirmed he did.  He was about 12 miles Northwest of me in the neighboring town of Bradenton.  He was further from the object than I was and it would have been lower in the horizon from his point of view, but he still had an unobstructed view since the land here is completely flat.  He was excited like myself, and urged me to bring out my telescope to have a closer look. I wanted to but I did not want to miss anything, and I was afraid the object would have disappeared by the time I set up my telescope (about 2 minutes time in a hurry). Both of us agreed this was not a Satellite, much too large and traveling too slow at what appeared to be an altitude of 10,000 ft. or so, definitetly not orbital. I also ruled out a helicopter because there was no sound. I still had not ruled out a possible large aircraft on approach to Sarasota/ Bradenton airport. It was not far off the appoach path commercial jet airliners take, and so I thought it might be the nose and wing lights appearing as one light head on, as they often do.  As the light traveled east of me and I was looking at it from the side, this now seemed unlikely. In addition, there were no red and green navigation lights, and again there was no sound.  After 3-4 minutes of this white light traveling in the sky, it suddenly changed to a red color! The best way I could describe it was the white light was extinguished and turned to a more subduded deep red color. It appeared to continue to travel in the same direction and speed. This lasted for maybe 5-10 seconds and then it disappeared all together. I immediately asked my friend to describe what he saw, and he collaborated what I just witnessed. We couldn't believe it! I continued to scan the skies for several more minutes, but saw nothing further.  Summing this up, I witnessed a large white-lighted object for a duration of approximately 4 minutes, traveling in the night sky at a slow rate of speed, then suddenly turning red before disappearing. The light was always steady, not strobed. Impossible to make out a shape of the object behind the light. There was no sound.  I consider myself a competent sky observer, having a pretty good knowledge of aircraft and the night skies. I'm 44 years of age and this is the first and only time I have ever observed a light in the sky that I could not explain to my satisfaction. This event happened earlier this year in February and apologize for submitting this late, but I thought it worthwhile. At the time of this sighting, I did in fact check the online submitted UFO reports and local newspaper to see if this strange light had been reported by anyone else here in Sarasota area, but I did not find anything.

Large white light attached to black object flying low in sky;2017-03-27 20:30:00;~2 minutes;Large white light attached to black object flying low in sky I was driving north on US 41 in Sarasota at around 8:30pm, when I spotted a bright white light low in the sky at my 10 o’clock position that did not appear not to be moving.  This put it over Sarasota Bay or the Gulf of Mexico, depending on the distance it was from me.  Much too large to be a star, my first impression was it was a low flying aircraft like when you see the landing lights of a commercial jet on approach coming towards you, it will give the appearance of it hovering.  The light in color was a bright silvery white not a yellowish white.  I figured it was a large military jet out of MacDill AFB, since commercial traffic to Sarasota/ Bradenton Airport do not come from this direction. I continued to watch it as best I could while I was driving as it really had my attention.  The sky was dark over the western horizon but not black, more of a violet hue as the sun had not been down too long.  I bring this up because as I continued to watch it I could actually make out a black shape behind the light,  I have to say I wasn’t sure what I was looking at. I rolled my window down and turned off my radio to see if I could hear an aircraft or helicopter, since I felt the object was close enough that I would be able to hear it.  There was no noise.  Another thing that entered my mind was it might be a blimp or balloon, maybe some kind of promotional thing positioned over the water. All these thoughts ran through my head very quickly, maybe 15-30 seconds. As I continued to drive I would lose sight of it for a few seconds from time to time because of its low angle in the sky where buildings and trees started to obstruct my view. I thought about pulling over but there was really no place that would give me a better view. Anyone on the bay or waterfront would have had a perfect, unobstructed view.  After losing sight of the object/ light for a short time, it appeared still to my left ahead of me but much closer and now at a higher angle so much so I had to peer out my driver’s window to get a good view. I was still driving North and it was clear the object/ light was indeed moving and traveling due East. It crossed over the highway slightly in front of me, almost directly over me, where I lost sight of it temporally before I could again see it from my passenger window to my right.  It continued to travel East at the same low attitude over what is a residential area. I want to point out from the time it passed over me and flew off to the East, I was only seeing the light and not the black object attached to it because that part of the sky was too dark.  Suddenly another identical light appeared to the right of it very close and level. They were close enough for me to consider both lights were attached to the same object but it had to be huge. I don’t think a KC-135 a! t 500 feet would appear that large. At the low altitude it appeared to be traveling, it was just going too slow for any jet to stay airborne. Again, I heard no sound and saw no red and green navigation lights during the whole sighting.  The two white lights became very low on the horizon as they seemed to continue to travel off to the East and I eventually lost sight of them as I continued to drive North. I’m at a loss of what I could have seen. There is another sighting with a similar description that was submitted to this website that took place on the same night and time but in a town 80 miles northeast of Sarasota, Florida. My time of 8:30 is only an approximation and could have been a little before or after.
