very large craft up close and personal;1981-03-25 20:00:00;10 minutes;very large craft up close and personal Approx on March 25, 1985 , 3 of us were night riding horses on the then incomplete I-75. Between Fruitville and University Pkwy the horses started to spook.   When we turned around there was a very large cylinder shaped craft behind us. It covered the roadway from fence to fence( what would soon be 6 lanes, a large median and shoulder lanes) , very large , NO NOISE at all , just flashing rotating lights of various colors.   It was mesmerizing to say the least like you could almost reach out and touch it. We all turned and just watched it.  The horses started to spook and brought us all back to reality.  We then decided to split up and run. It disappeared behind us as fast as it had appeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
Two silver white cylinders moving way to fast for a blimp;2004-12-26 16:00:00;3-4 minutes;Two silver white cylinders moving way to fast for a blimp I probably wouldn't have seen them if I hadn't been clearing brush and trimming trees, looked up at some of my handiwork and there it was. A silvery, whiteish colored cylinder rounded on both ends flying north to south, thought it was a jet banking as there were no wings visible. It didn't come out of a bank and continued to fly due south, from the rear before the tree's blocked the view it just looked like a round ball. While I am pondering what I had just seen another craft just like it followed the same path and at the same speed. My impression was that they were about the same length as a 747 but about three times the diameter, flying at about 15000 ft. somewhere between 200-400 mph. I watched the sky for a while after that, was able to make out wings or tailfins on jets I saw even when they were at altitudes high enough to leave a short contrail, also could hear the jet sounds of all the jets I watched even the one flying south with the wind. The ufo's left no contrail and made no sound that I could hear. If they are a new blimp, cudo's to US, very fast for a blimp. I thought I could see a dark aura , sort of pointed, above and below craft, may have been an illusion as I hadn't been looking at the sky before the sighting.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
spotted hovering silent clyndrical object.;2009-08-08 07:07:00;1:30;spotted hovering silent clyndrical object. Waiting for bus, noticed bright object almost over head.  About 1500 ft up. It hovered and was silent, then started to move up and to the northwest.  It was a very bright white. The sighting occured about 1/2 mile from airport SRQ. I am an ex navy meteorologist, so I have a lot of sky watching under my belt.  This is the first time I have seen something I can not explain.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
This object was extremely clear and easy to see, silent and the dim lights were fascinating to watch.;2012-10-21 03:40:00;10 seconds;This object was extremely clear and easy to see, silent and the dim lights were fascinating to watch. On the morning of October 21, 2012 at approximately 0330 hours I went outdoors to observe a meteor shower that supposedly originates in the area of Orion. My observation point was the lanai of a condo in Sarasota, Florida. I was on the top floor of the condo which would place me at approximately 50 feet from the ground. The weather was perfect with a clear sky, no moon, and a chilly breeze coming from the north.  The breeze was strong enough to move the tree limbs, slightly.  Orion was almost overhead, being 10 degrees south. I was watching the sky, not seeing one meteor, when I caught movement to my left. I then observed an object that was silently and steadily moving through the sky traveling East Southeast. It was going approximately 2 MPH and I observed this object for 10 seconds.  The body of the object, from my observation point, was dark and was approximately 14 inches long, 3 inches wide and was squared on the ends. At the side and coming off each corner was approximately 7 wavy lines, faint in brightness which gave off a glow similar to a dim florescent bulb.  These appeared to be fixed to a part of the object approximately 1 inch wide and 2 inches long.  Through these faint wavy lines a slightly brighter glow pulsed moving from the object outwards.  As I stated, this object made no sound. It was approximately 20 degrees below Orion. the object appeared as if it was only 30 feet or so above me. As the object passed over the building and thus blocking my view of further observation, within another 30 seconds I observed a dark round object moving to the east. This object was moving at approximately 5 mph and had no lights or sound. The cause of the object to be noticed was the object was darker than the sky. It appeared to be higher in the sky and approximately the same angle from Orion as the first object. I am a retired Lt. firefighter/paramedic with 27 years service and have not seen an object such as this.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
It was definitely cylinder shaped. It had white lights on the inside, and had lights on the bottom of the object.;2019-04-16 20:00:00;7 minutes;It was definitely cylinder shaped.  It had white lights on the inside, and had lights on the bottom of the object.  The lights located on the bottom seemed to be separated.  One light shining more from the left, and the other shining more from the right.  It looked as if it had 2 decks, a lower and an upper. It was located near the moon, but not too close to it. Every now and again, it would raise up, and nobody could see it.  After about 30 seconds, it would lower back down, and become more visible. As we were driving, a car was on the side of the road, he had no flat tires, not out of fuel, the hood was up and the engine was fine.  It had just stopped working, abd from the looks of it, due to magnetic/electric effects from the object. I didn't think it looked like a satellite, however, it may be.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
