What looked like a shooting star STOPS and changes direction 90 degrees and disappears!;1997-06-01 23:00:00;3 seconds;What looked like a shooting star STOPS and changes direction 90 degrees and disappears! It was about 11 at night. My mom was out on the front porch talking to her boyfriend at the time. I stepped outside to talk with them for a minute.  As I'm talking I'm looking out in to the open sky.  I have a knack for seeming to always see shooting stars, so I always look up.   As I'm talking and looking out I see what looks to me like a shooting star.  Flying from south to north, from my right to my left. It flies across the sky just like a shooting star would, but then when it was at my 12 o'clock, it stops.  Motionless.  For a full and complete second. Then BOOM 90 degrees straight up in to the sky and disappeared.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151

It was shaped like a blimp going approx 100-200 mph and flew right over my head (no sound). I was driving down a country road approx 55 mph. I saw a light in the distance which I thought was a plane. As I drove the light was not getting closer just dimmer then brighter. I came to a T in the road. The object was very close now. I got out of my car and noticed a white light in front of the aircraft then 4 red lights in a row along the right side underneath. I thought it was some sort of blimp until I estimated it going 100-200 mph (approx 5000 ft high). The object flew straight over my head with no sound. I chased it in my car. The object then vanished. I thought I saw it reappear miles ahead of me for about 2 seconds. It was dark but not pitch black. No stars were in the sky yet.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
White ball shape, with grey bottom and single row of multicolor lights,decended from cloud, traveled East to West overhead.;2001-08-11 17:00:00;2 minutes;White ball shape, with grey bottom and single row of multicolor lights,decended from cloud, traveled East to West overhead. White ball shaped object descended from a dark cloud following a wind gust. Object seemed unsteady for few moments after exiting the cloud. The object was round like a ball with nothing visible attached to it. It was white in color, with a greyish bottom. We saw one line of multi colored lights on the bottom of the object. No noise was heard. It was observed by my brother that in the grey area there were four evenley spaced holes that we assume could hold the landing gear. And there was also one square shape in the center of the bottom. My brother and I saw the ship descend from the east, and after the object steadied itself it travled west in a straight line over us. Once the object reached the clear sky we could no longer see it.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151

Then I wondered if I was seeing a flock of white birds in perfect formation at night  . But silent . Then I tried to catch sight of the few clouds out and they were travelling much higher up and much more slowly in a different direction ,and the air around me was still ..Then this large thin white cloudlike line passed away from view . I am a mom who was out to get exercise . In all the twenty years I have known my husband , I have never mentioned a U.F.O. to him .I am mystefied;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
A bright shinny silver object over University Parkway;2006-06-22 17:35:00;Over two minutes;A bright shinny silver object over University Parkway I was driving west on University Parkway between I-75 and US 301 when I noticed something sparkling in the sky. It was a shinny silver silver colored object. I slowed to about 20mph and noticed other drivers looking up as well. It was a half moon shaped object that seemed to be changing directions. As i got closer to it I could see the shape, as if when it was level it was very thin. It was turning around, so it went to a 45 degree angle and to a 90 degree angle then very thin again as it went from South to North. It wasnt moving very fast because when I first saw the sparkle it was about 45 seconds until the shape started to change and I could see the definition. There were no clouds, birds, or airplanes in the area.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
bright light fading then reappear in same spot in sky;2011-10-31 20:00:00;6 seconds;bright light fading then reappear in same spot in sky I was sitting with my wife, kids and in laws passing out candy in their driveway on Halloween. The driveway faces East.  Above the houses about 45-60 degrees up, I seen what looked like was going to be a shooting star because a light appeared in the sky and began to brighten.  It was not moving. Its intensity grew from nothing to brighter than anything in the sky within about 2 seconds.  At the apex of its brightness, my memory see's the shape as almost being hollow or empty in the middle...as if I was looking at a donut shape with the hole in the middle but just very slightly stretched out.  As soon as it reached its brightest point, it began to fade again and within another 2 or 3 seconds it was gone. I said something to my wife but she looked up and it was gone.  I starred into the same spot and about 20 minutes or so later it did it again.  Same pattern same spot. It did not reappear anymore. The sky was cloudless and clear.  It was not a star nor a satelli! te or flare.  It was not moving in any direction and did reappear after I first saw it.  It didnt appear to have any particular color except maybe a bit of yellow.  I took note of where it was in relationship to other stars.  I do not know the constellations but can remember where it was exactly both times it appeared in relationship to the stars in the eastern sky.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151

Identical to a Report that was filed here from Vero Beach on 09-24-19 Went out this morning before Sunrise and Witnessed this Object. Heard a low hush type sound first and looked up to see this maybe 1000 feet up. Almost Silent glide flight. V shaped, semi-transparent. Ground reflections or lights on it looked like it was a small cluster white birds at first then realized as it passed directly over me it obscured the view of the stars as it was a very clear morning. It was moving no more than 100 knots and we live very close to the Airport in Sarasota. This was moving from Northeast to Southwest. I know what I saw and to find the report from Vero Beach that is almost exact to mine makes me know what I saw was something real and from another World.   starts in a v shape. We had Clear star sky. Heading west to east towards Atlantic Ocean. Only saw the shape/outline of the craft because it was reflecting off the ground lights.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
UFO orb flying over Sarasota;2020-01-20 18:35:00;15 minutes;UFO orb flying over Sarasota I was watching the sunset at Rothenbach Park for about an hour, watching airplanes so by when I noticed a italic shining like orb in the sky not quite as high as an airplane but probably the size of an airplane.  It was circular all the way around and moved up and down left and right side to side, which ever way I wanted at random speeds and was obviously man, it disappeared suddenly after about five to 10 minutes of watching;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
Fish scales looking object moving in the sky;2020-05-05 13:00:00;5 minutes;Fish scales looking object moving in the sky I was driving north bound on Beneva Road at the intersection of Fruitville road in the turning lane to go east. I saw through my windshield what looked like thousands of balloons that had all been released at the same time. However, there were no crowds of people or anything to cue a balloon release. I continued to watch and it was moving together like fish scales. It was a translucent silver color. I turned when the light did and they continued to go eastbound on Fruitville with me. I turned on Richardson road to go home and was continuing to watch out my driver side window at the object. It then darted off at a high rate of speed over the Fruitville park soccer field going northbound. I have never seen anything like this. They all moved as one together like fish scales almost. The objects were shiny and glittery like.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
