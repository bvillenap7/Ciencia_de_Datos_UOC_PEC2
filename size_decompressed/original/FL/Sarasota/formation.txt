I didn't know where to look. 2 dim lights that looked like stars, that were side by side, went up into an arch and back to roughly where they started from and fizzled out.. amazing.  didn't believe. lost my mind for as min. now i'm a believer.

Dim lights;2012-10-01 06:30:00;10 seconds;dim lights At 6:30 am I saw a group of 12 to 15 lights traveling south.  it was in a loose V formation.  The lights were dim and roundish and faded from the center out to appear fuzzy at the edges. I could not judge the size or distance. but would estimate at less than 500 feet above me and 30 to 40 feet in diameter.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
Formation of 4 what looked like stars moving across night sky from north to south.;2014-08-26 03:00:00;2 minutes;Formation of 4 what looked like stars moving across night sky from north to south. 26 Aug., 2014, about 3 AM EST, it was exeptionally clear out.  I was star gazing when a triangular formation of stars caught my eye.  I noticed they were moving from north to south and were moving in the triangular formation of 4 like a flock of geese.   This formation covered a large area and were definately very high in the atmosphere or higher.  They were lit like stars and were moving at a high rate of speed.  They did not deviate out of their formation.  The whole time I witnessed this was a total of 2 minutes max.  I've seen the space station pass over head several times and the speed at which it passed through from one horizon to the other was about the same speed.   I am a commercial airline pilot  and these were not your typical airliners or aircraft as they have strobes and nav lights lit.   I can't emphasize enough the amount of area  this formation was but it was rather large and it was very high up.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
