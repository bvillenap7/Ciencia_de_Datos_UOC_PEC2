BELIEVE IT OR NOT, AT 13 I PRAYED TO SEE A UFO AND WITHIN 3-5 MINUTES I HEARD A LOW RUMBLING SOUND FOR 15 SEC. AND THEN SAW A DISC FLOAT BY SILENTLY OUT THE WINDOW. Hard to believe still, but I was 13 reading a book on UFO's and prayed to God to see one for myself.  Within 3-5 minutes I heard a sound out the open window toward the road that sounded like a cross between a semi-truck idling and a tank.  After about 15 seconds and seeing nothing go by on the dirt road the sound stopped as abruptly as it had started.  I then suddenly saw the upper half (the lower half was hidden by bushes between me and the driveway) of a disc-shaped craft silently glide by, it's surface reflecting in the light from the carport.  I saw no lights as it passed by quickly, but there were no windows at all like there would have been if it were a car, and it was made out of what looked like brushed aluminum. I watched to see if it would come back around the bend of the U-shaped driveway, but it didn't.  It didn't back up because my eyes were glued (and heart nearly pumping out of my chest) to the driveway from where I was sitting at the dining room table.  It couldn't go straight because it would've crashed into the carport.  It couldn't have gone left because of the orange grove and the porch.  It DIDN'T go right because I would've seen it come around the driveway.  I went out after about 5-15 minutes (I lost track of time then because I was so nervous and was trying to convince myself I was hallucinating... after all, I was wondering why God had answered my prayer so quickly!).  But I just kept saying to myself, But I know that I know I saw what I saw and I heard what I heard!. I checked it all out and looked for marks on the ground in the one place that was my blind spot the place after where I saw it pass the window, but BEFORE where it would've hit the carport if it had continued to go straight.  Looking around and seeing only trees with their giant branches overhanging the driveway, and porches, and carports, I stood in the blind spot and discovered that the only way out from that spot was UP!  A break in the tree branches was just large enough to allow a car-sized (or disc-sized) object to go through.  There were no other options period!  Then I knew it was the real thing.

Two silent west bound objects gulf coast of Florida;2001-03-11 09:45:00;5-6 seconds;Two silent west bound objects gulf coast of Florida I live in Bradenton, Florida, have been a letter carrier for thirty years and I am currently 53-years old.  Growing up I was an Air Force dependent and spent three years in the US Army 1966-69 serving a year combat tour in Vietnam. On the morning of Sunday, March 11, 2001, my wife and I took four of our dogs to Sarasota, Florida, approximately 10 miles south of where we live, to walk them at a place called Robarts Arena.  This is an area covering several acres and is where county fairs, rodeos, etc., are held.  I was walking about 50 yards in front of my wife when I simply heard the noise of a small single engine plane overhead and looked up to observe it.  When I first located the plane another object caught my eye.  This object was light gray and circular.  Seagulls are common here and I thought perhaps that it what I was looking at but it did not waver or move erratic as they do.  It was obvious this object was moving in a direct line westward.  I then noticed another object of the same description in what appeared to be about a quarter mile apart traveling same direction and speed as the first.  Other than the small plane's engine, there were no other sounds of aircraft.  There is an airport located in Sarasota and a McDill Air Force base located 50 miles north in Tampa.  However, my years around all types of aircraft left me with the certainty that these two objects were not normal aircraft.  When I turned to my wife and pointed to what I had seen, the objects were no longer in view.  After several hours of thought, I felt it should be reported to this organization.  There were no distinctive markings, lights, or other features just to very light gray circular objects. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and found him to be a quite credible witness.  His description of what he and his wife reportedly had seen was quite precise, and described in unambiguous, objective terms.  We deem this to be a quite good report.

Strange Object in Photograph, Southwest Florida;2003-12-31 17:45:00;?;Strange Object in Photograph, Southwest Florida My wife were planning to go to the beach on New Year's Eve to take some photos of sunset.  We grabbed the digicam and walked out the door.  We had an amazing view of sunset from outside of our apartment so we took a few pictures.  I have a habit of snapping between 2 and 5 pictures in a quick duration just in case one is blurred or one doesn't come out.  When we downloaded the pictures I commented that something must have been on my lens, but looking at the pictures, I realized this object was only in one photo of the set (taken within 10 second duration).  There are sunlit clouds around but the object is framed in clear blue sky.  There is a metallic reflection on a disk shaped object.  You can zoom in on it and it becomes even clearer. I am a 30-something biologist and I know this isn't a bird...it wouldn't have left the frame that quickly anyway, neither would an aircraft. I would be willing to forward the photos.  I would like a second opinion on what this could be... ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We have reviewed three photos submitted by the witness.  There is a tiny, dark object in the second photo, but we cannot identify it.  It may be a bird, but that is pure conjecture on our part.  We do not know what the object is, and it is too small for us to be able to determine unambiguously what it is.  PD));27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
Disk over Bee Ridge;2006-11-01 10:20:00;A couple seconds;Disk over Bee Ridge I was riding the bus, headed east on Bee Ridge.  The clouds this morning were very low and moving very fast.  As I was watching the sky, very close to the bus, right in front of me , an object that was very thin and metallic flew out of one bigger cloud, and into a smaller cloud then disappeared.  I couldnt see much of the object because it all happened so fast.  I doubt anyone else saw it.  The object my guess was about 15-20 feet long.  Even though I was on the bus, I didn't hear any sound.  I do know though, that if it were an airplane or a helicopter, it should have reappeared out of the cloud it went into right away and then should have been visible for a very long time.  It was just flying way too low.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
Round- Disc Shaped Craft  with 4 - 5 windows or lights, hovering silently in lower level of clouds;2007-02-28 20:30:00;10 - 15 seconds;Round- Disc Shaped Craft  with 4 - 5 windows or lights, hovering silently in lower level of clouds It was approximately 8:30 p.m., Wednesday evening, February 28th, 2007, Sarasota, Florida. My husband and I were driving North on McIntosh Road, South of Clark road, having just left the Sarasota Square Mall, when in the sky all of the sudden we could see an object light up. It appeared to be round and have 4 to 5 lights or windows from the one edge we could see. The ship was fairly close to us and somewhat large, and then it just turned off. My husband said to me, Did you see that?, I replied I sure did!!. Then it turned on again and after another 3 or 4 seconds turned off again. I was desperately feeling inside my purse for my digital camera without taking my eyes off the area of clouds from which this was occurring. As we were still traveling I had to look out my window (which had been rolled down already due to beautiful florida weather)and look back because the object never moved, only hovered and did not make a sound. It never came back on again and I told my husband to stop and go back, but having our 3 children in the car, he did not want to. There are no towers or anything in this area. It was a clear night just a few clouds in which the object lit up. I still can not believe we saw what we saw... I can assure you of this though... this was not an airplane, or helicopter, or lights from some grand opening... this was a rounded, disc shaped object that humans have not built yet, (at least that i know of)The ship was fairly close to us and somewhat large.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151

We got excellent video and a still shot of the two closest ones that were the brightest.   My daughter was on top of a parking garage and panning the horizon for the fireworks.  She unknowingly videotaped the discs while doing so.  We didn’t know until we watched the video later of their presence.   There were no strobe lights or sound from these craft.  In the video you can see the tilt up to a 45 degree angle and disappear.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151

As she panned across the horizon she unknowingly caught a squadron of what looks like ufo’s.  We have two clips. This one shows them the best.

Many UFOs gathering in the night sky above Sarasota. Noticed 1 on 7/10/2021 and the sky has been full of them since.;2021-07-10 00:15:00;8 days;Many UFOs gathering in the night sky above Sarasota. Noticed 1 on 7/10/2021 and the sky has been full of them since. On 7/10/2021 walking outside I saw something that wasn't a star in the night sky. Looking at it for over 15 minutes I was certain it was moving and recorded video and took photos. In the video you can see a disk-shaped craft spinning very fast, moving all over the night sky. The next night 7/11/2021 there were approx 30-40 crafts in the sky. Every night since then the crafts sit in the night sky with some of them warping away. You can shine your phone light at a craft high above you and they will slightly move/twinkle.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
