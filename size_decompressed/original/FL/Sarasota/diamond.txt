Bright Orange Diamond Shaped UFO In Sarasota Florida;2011-07-16 02:15:00;4 to 5 minutes;Bright Orange Diamond Shaped UFO In Sarasota Florida At 2:15 on the morning of July 16, 2011 my father, myself, and my father’s best friend who I call uncle were returning from an offshore fishing trip.  Our plan that night was to go out on the boat before dark, (about 8:00) find a spot about 35 miles offshore and fish through the night there.  We expected to return the next morning.  The waves were much rougher than they were supposed to be so I got very sick and slept and the cushion in the front of the boat.  My dad also became sea sick but he kept fishing making it even worse to the point that we decided to return early. As we were pulling up to our dock at about 2:15 in the morning I was getting the ropes ready and my dad was driving so we were not looking at the sky.  My uncle then said “what is that?” and pointed to the sky, when we looked up we saw an object that appeared to be on fire.  I thought the object was a plane about to crash but I soon noticed that it was not.  I could see that the top of the object looked like a large isosceles triangle pointing upward and the bottom looked like a small equilateral triangle pointing downward.  I was very interested in the object so I watched and after a few minutes my father and uncle dismissed it and began unloading the boat.  As I continued to watch the object it went from the bright flaming orange color to a darker yellow color as it got smaller this looked to me like it was going farther away.  The object retained its shape as it got smaller. The object made no sound the whole time.  I then watched it go across the sky from the left to the r! ight at a very high speed then immediately stop, hover in place for about 2 seconds then completely disappear.  Then we saw nothing more of the object. Later on my dad asked my uncle if he thought it was the sheriff’s helicopter (which I knew it wasn’t) and he said no which was a trusted opinion because he is a lieutenant with the Police Department.  None of us said anything about it being a UFO but we probably were all thinking it.  Later on I talked about what I saw with my dad and he told me he thought it may have been a UFO.  When I told my sister she did believe that we saw something that night but would not admit she thought it was a UFO.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
