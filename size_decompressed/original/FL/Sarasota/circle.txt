It dropped directly;2016-03-26 20:15:00;3 minutes;There were two purple lights in the western sky.  One was in a fixed position and the other one came from below it.  It dropped directly beside the other for about 3 seconds then continued moving straight up into the sky and then stopped.  The one that had been still then moved up and dropped directly beside it for another 3 seconds.  At this time they began to move straight down toward the ground until out of sight.   These objects are similar to two orange orbs that were seen over a month ago in the general area.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151

Bright orange flare like objects moving very slowly in night sky.;2017-02-11 19:38:00;5 minutes;bright orange flare like objects moving very slowly in night sky Witnessed six to eight very bright orange circular objects in a semi straight line over Sarasota Florida at around 7:38 pm on 2/11/2017.  A few seemed to fade out and back in while others stayed very bright (could be from clouds but it seemed crystal clear out).    About 2 hours later that evening I could smell what seemed to be gum powder or the smell right after fireworks and the area had a heavy haze near the ground.  This event happened within a few mile of the coast line so not sure if maybe the Coast Guard accidentally dropped some flares or not....they have not said anything that I have heard at this time.  Note:  this happened within a mile of SRQ airport.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
3 objects forming triangle, before dispersing.  ((anonymous report));2017-07-24 22:00:00;30 minutes;3 objects forming triangle, before dispersing. I went outside to smoke a cigarette and noticed three objects in the sky, moving around each other very oddly.  The objects then formed a triangle and two of them moved downward where I couldn't see them anymore.   The other one stayed put for about 30 mins before I could no longer see it.  Many planes came to check out the area when the object was in the sky.  The objects were flashing the colors red, green, and blue, I believe.

Round bright light emiting random white beams of light to the west and red beams of light to the east of it. No sounds.;2018-05-30 23:00:00;2 hours;Round bright light emiting random white beams of light to the west and red beams of light to the east of it. No sounds, hovering, moved I was sitting at the beach observing the stars.  There was a brighter and bigger round white light. It would randomly emit a white light to the east and a red light to the west of it.  I thought it was my eyes but I didnâ€™t observe this in any other star.  I thought it may be a plane but a plane went by and I saw it had blue and red lights and this object was not moving or making sounds.  I thought it may be a drone because it started moving making a circle and then moved similar to a dragon fly, hovering but with jerky movements but then it froze for a long time again.  Later it moved to the west the then back to the east, quickly. About an hour later it appeared smaller in diameter initially I thought it was my imagination but about another hour later it went really farther and appeared really small and now it was emitting a red light instead of white.  It totally disappeared before appearing at a great distance in red. I had to stars in the sky I was using as a reference to observe movement.  Initially it moved to the right some and then farther away after making the circular movement.  I observed it in the sky for 2- 2.5 hours.  My daughter was with me and I pointed out to her the random beams of light to see if she observed it also and she confirmed it.  My daughter was the one who initially observed the movement.  I also called my husband out to see it and he did but was not curious about it like I was he went back in the house after taking a look at it. The following night, when I arrived at my house in Ocala, Fl, I observed the light was in the sky again about at 2200.  I took a shower and went outside to see if the light was still there but it was not.  Being surrounded by houses I could not see as well as when on the beach. I researched on line to see if it could have been Mars but because of the observable circular movement with the naked eye, it could not have been Mars.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
