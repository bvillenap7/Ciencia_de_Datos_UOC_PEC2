Cigar Flying Headed North Over Fruitville in Sarasota;2007-07-09 11:15:00;1-2 minutes;Cigar Flying Headed North Over Fruitville in Sarasota I was driving west on Honore Ave, and it was about midday.  The sky was bright blue, clear with a few small clouds here and there .  Looking ahead of me, I saw in the sky what appeared to me at first to be a typical passenger jet.  It was a perfect cigar shape and appeared to be white with a black band around the middle of it. The longer I looked at it, the more I began to notice things that made me see that it wasn't a passenger jet.  I'm not the greatest at guessing distances, but, the craft was flying at, I would say, 10000-12000 feet.  It appeared to be flying at the same speed of an aircraft approaching an airport for landing, or that of a small single passenger private plane.  I would also say that it wasn't more than 3 miles in front of me. I did not hear any noise coming from it at all, whether it was too far or not.  I also did not see any kind of wings, fins or engines on the craft.  It appeared to be smoothly cruising to the north, right over Fruitville, clost to I-75. The craft was still in front of me as I watched it until it disappeared behind a small cloud, at which it never did reappear from behind of.  I pulled over and watched the spot in the sky where I last saw it for about 10 minutes with hopes that it would return again so that I could try to get a picture with my cell phone.  After 10 minutes, it had still not reappeared from behind the cloud.   There were also no contrails or chemtrails left behind from this object.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
