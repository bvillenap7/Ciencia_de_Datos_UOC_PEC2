bright white Object darting cloud to cloud near Sarasota FL.;2001-02-16 12:15:00;less then 1 minute;bright white Object darting cloud to cloud near Sarasota FL. I was driving with my fiance (she was driving) from Tampa to Sarasota just after noon, we were on I-75 between bradenton and Sarasota (closer to Sarasota) I was looking out the passenger side window at the clouds and I saw an object that was darting across the sky very fast west of my position over the gulf, it looked like it was far away, yet I could see it clearly, it looked round (it was bright white in color) it went into a small puff of cloud (that didn't appear so far away, from I-75 it the cloud looked like it was a few miles off the coast) it then stayed in the cloud for about  5 seconds, reversed trajectory + up at around a 45 degree angle to another small cloud, stayed there for about another 10 seconds the shot off at a right angle to another cloud EXTREMELY fast, then did not come out. I know there might be normal explanations for this observation, but it just did not look normal to me.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
Crome object seen on Siesta Key Beach, FL and Pic.;2002-12-01 17:30:00;1 minute;Crome object seen on Siesta Key Beach, FL and Pic. As my girlfriend and i were walking on the beach of Siesta Key, my girlfriend said what is that so i looked and saw a staionary crome oval shape object and blew it off as nothing when she said thats a UFO, i looked closer and it was not moving one way or the other so i said oh it's probably a reflection of a plane or something, we looked away for one or two seconds and looked back and it was gone, now there wasnt a cloud in the sky so i was looking all around for the object but never saw it again until i looked at the pictures i had took of the sunset after that. I have a interesting picture i would like someone to look at, thank you.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
Seen 3/18/2004 near longboat beach in Sarasota. Amazing sphere just above water. Great photo of the object.;2004-03-18 22:14:00;35 seconds;Seen 3/18/2004 near longboat beach in Sarasota. Amazing sphere just above water. Great photo of the object. The object was a sphereical light that appeared to be elongated to approximately 15 feet that was just above the water. It traveled parallel to the beach and was seen for about 35 seconds from the point first seen and it moved from right to left. It was brilliant and as I had been taking pictures of some night birds I had an opportunity to take a quick picture just as it started to recede from our view to the left from where we were standing on the beach.  The picture is amazing and is one of the most vivid pictures ever taken of a ufo. I have not published it at this point but waiting to try and have it analized further to try and gather more information on it. I have contacted the local authorities but evidently it was not seen by others in the area. It was small and localized just above the water at sarasota - longboat beach area.  I welcome anyone else who wishes to assist in analizing this to please contact me at ((e-address deleted)). I will be glad to send the picture for your analysis.  It was so close to us and was so amazing that I am hoping others have seen something like this so I can compare notes. The picture must be seen to be believed. ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested a copy of the photo, but have not received it yet.  PD));27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
Large glowing red object moving slowly;2010-05-29 21:10:00;1 minute;Large glowing red object moving slowly We saw the strangest thing in the skies tonight around 9:10 p.m. It was very large, roughly spherical, but vertically so and glowing red.  It was heading northwest in a leisurely manner.  From our perspective, it seemed to have an uneven rate of acceleration.  We watched it for about a minute and half before it looked as if it were getting smaller (or more distant) and then it disappeared from sight. We had never seen anything like it before and wondered it was a meteorite—although it didn’t seem like it was falling.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151

He described seeing them at 1:00 to 2:00 AM in the morning. Further he mentioned the sounds of explosions with the sight. The story also reported that dozens of others had similar sightings.  My wife and I were on vacation in Sarasota Florida on that date and, before this story was published, I told my wife and daughter the same story. I gave them more details and described what the lights looked like while hovering over the (totally black) Gulf of Mexico. It was an amazing sight.  The website asked for input from others who might be able to solve the question of the light source. As a result, I provided a full recounting of my experience. That was two weeks ago and I've not heard any feedback.  My questions are: was any source/explanation ever found? Did your observatory cameras pick up anything? Is any follow up planned? Did anyone else report the incident?  These lights must have rotated with the earth because I saw them in exactly the same position until 4:00 AM that morning (4 hours). How is that possible?  I'd appreciate any input you might have.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
