Two football field size craft with no lights, no sound at 2000';2003-03-15 02:00:00;1 minute;Two football field size craft with no lights, no sound at 2000' I was back from work... relaxing, after my 8 hour shift and playing piano.  It was around 2 a.m. and a silent, balmy night.  Clear and 70Â°, just beautiful.  I was looking at the sky and soaking in the quiet neighborhood in delight. Flying in from the north I witnessed a large football field size craft at about 2000' +/- It was flying southeast towards the Everglades. The initial object was literally cruising at perhaps 200 mph. What is that?, I exclaimed.  The object was really more square vs. rectangular and was black against the sky.  It had no lights at all and flew across the sky on a straight path.  There was absolutely no noise emanating from the craft.  Silent! It was huge.. no wings.. no noise, no lights. I know altitude well from many private and commercial flights over my life. Then, to my amazement, approximately 1/4 mile behind was a second craft of exactly the same dimensions, on the same flight path. I was in amazement at the middle of the night at this experience and will never forget it.  How could these 2 objects fly with no wings, sound, lights etc.  What was this really? I saw 2 objects and was stunned. Military? This was a UFO sighting... and a double sighting.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
5 good sized orange to white rectangular to oblong moving objects;2013-10-25 21:00:00;~1 minute;5 good sized orange to white rectangular to oblong moving objects We were walking the greyhound at the open lot at the corner of Fruitville and 41.  Looking up toward downtown and Venus.  5 undulating oblong orange rectangular shapes appeared next to each other in almost a rhythmic dance.  They stayed clumped together moving back and forth and spinning.  We both observed them for the duration.  They were brighter than Venus, and larger in the sky than a star would appear.  They appeared substantial in size, and not like the blinking lights of an airplane would appear.  They had mass, and appeared as pulsating orange shapes with a glowing white center and white around the edges.  They spread out and contracted their distance from each other continuously.  At the end they swarmed together and almost combined into one point of light in one large mass, then they moved off in different directions and faded out into nothingness.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
Red, rectangular shaped object, completely silent, was still as if watching something.  Moved off after 3-4 minutes to the east.;2014-03-05 17:00:00;3-5 minutes;Red, rectangular shaped object, completely silent, was still as if watching something.  Moved off after 3-4 minutes to the east. Bright fire engine red color. Rectangular.  Looked like a Phone Booth. Approximately 150' from ground, or about 12 stories high. Stayed stationary about 3 minutes. Totally silent. Moved in straight line to the east. Watched until faded into horizon. Very very weird.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
