My mom kept saying my name and I was ignoring her because I thought she was trying to joke or tell me a story of something when I was a kid.  After the fourth time of her calling me, I said, what ma!  She said look in the sky its a UFO.  My eyes shot straight to where she was pointing.  Just over our head 4 egg shape but more oval with Scot almost see through edges and sides flew over the top of us.  Quiet, soft, kinda like it was exposed to my eyes by it capturing the moon lite on the craft.  They had a soft dim glow to each one.  Tinted light green soft greenish yellow.  They flew soft steady, quiet, nothing like I have ever seen.  I was in the marine cops I know military craft I know noises of propulsion.  This was quiet, like an ice skater gliding on a rink of ice.  The most amazing awe mind shock I’ve ever witnessed.  Amazing moment.  I hope others come forward with this.  It was so close just wow.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
