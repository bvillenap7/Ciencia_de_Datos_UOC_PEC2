Bright fireball travelling S - N leaving a trail;2002-12-21 21:52:00;4 - 5 seconds;Bright fireball travelling S - N leaving a trail While on neighborhood security patrol we saw a very bright fireball travelling from south to north. It was a very clear night with a full moon. The fireball was leaving a trail. It caught our attention as soon as it passed directly overhead and was still very bright when we lost sight of it due to trees. It looked similar to other Earth-grazer meteors I have seen, but lasted longer. It was most likely a meteor, but I felt that it was worth reporting. I'm sure that many people driving on I-75 must have seen it. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION)) Hi Peter, If you want to update the report, my wife and I were talking about the object and think it may have lasted as long as 7 - 8 sec before losing sight of it. I'm not a pilot  at this time, but still hope to get licensed at some point.  I made a career change last year that put flying on the back burner.  I do fly R/C aircraft though and am currently building a 1/5th scale Cub. Good luck on your search for a Cub! Best regards,  ((name deleted)) ((END));27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
Bright yellow ball with red comet tail turning into 3 lights in the shape of a triangle;2003-09-09 00:31:00;8-10 min;Bright yellow ball with red comet tail turning into 3 lights in the shape of a triangle I had just gotten off work at 12:30 in the A.M. and as I was leaving the parking lot I noticed an object in the sky. I slowed to a stop along side the road and watched it. It was a bright yellow ball with a comet tail that was bright red. It was close enough that I could see individual sparks coming off the tail. I immediately called 911 on my cell phone. It was heading from the north to the south at about a 15 degree downward angle and appeared to be on an approach path to Sarasota / Bradenton Airport. My work is immediatly behind the airport. I thought it was an aircraft coming in on fire. As I watched and spoke to the officer the tail got shorter and shorter until it was only the bright yellow ball. By this time it was directly in front of me on Tallevast Rd. At this point it appeared to stop moving. The yellow ball the split into 3 white lights in the shape of a perfect triangle. At this point I told the officer that he would think I was crazy and described to him what I saw. He told me that he had several other calls coming in reporting lights. The 3 lights then headed slowly away from me directly infront of me going east on Tallevast Rd. I followed Them for about 1.5 miles. The road was under construction and I could go no farther. I sat and watched the lights for 1 to 2 minutes until they gadually got too far away to see. I have seen the explanation that this was a Titan 4 launch but there is no way this is possible. I have seen other launches and they don't last as long or behave as in this sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is a public employee.  PD));27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
Fireball in the evening sky;2006-01-30 18:10:00;5 minutes;Fireball in the evening sky About 6:10pm last night my girlfriend called me and told me to go outside and look North and tell her what I saw. When I was outside I observed what appeared to be a giant fireball in the North sky. It resembled what we see when the shuttle takes off from the space center, but was much brighter. It wasn't falling, it was heading North. I took out my binoculars and continued to observe the craft until it disappeared. I live about 50 miles from Macdill Airforce Base, so I am used to seeing jets flying through the air, but this did not resemble any trail left by a jet that I have seen before. The flame was much bigger and left no smoke. Did anyone else observe this object? ((NUFORC Note:  Possible contrail?  PD));27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151

Again I thought maybe a meteorite, but as i watched another similar object came from the north towards and past  both these objects.I watched beginning to end over a minute, as i called my wife and asked her to look, by time she got outside lights were gone;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
Two light objects sighted flying south off the west coast of Sarasota, FL;2008-12-25 20:00:00;4-5 minutes;Two light objects sighted flying south off the west coast of Sarasota, FL The following event was observed on December 25th 2008 at approximately 8pm eastern time from the 7000 block of Point of Rocks Rd, Sarasota, FL (N27-14.6 W082-32.00).  The visibility was greater then 10 miles, the cloud layer was scattered at approximately 5000 feet and the winds were out of the south east at approximately 10-15 knots on the surface. At 8pm eastern time, I observed a lighted object roughly 3 miles to the north west of my position about 60 degrees above the horizon, moving south paralleling the west coast of Siesta Key.  The object initially appeared to be a plane with an engine fire but as it approached closer to my position it became apparent that it was more of a spear emitting light similar to intensity and appearance of a common marine flare, flickering yellow and orange/red in color. The object traveled from its position north west of me, almost due south, paralleling the coast for about 2-3 miles.  At its closest point of approach it was due west of my position by approximately 2 miles, or about 1.5 miles west of the beach of Point of Rocks.  At this point the object appeared to stop moving and began to climb.  I was unable to determine if the object actually stopped moving, or turned its motion directly away from me.  Either way, the object climbed into the cloud deck and began to fade from sight as it passed through the 5000’ scattered cloud deck.  As it began to climb and fade from sight, another object, identical in appearance to the first, appeared approximately 2 miles to the north west of my position at approximately the same altitude taking an almost identical flight path as the first.  The first object had faded completely away by the time the second object made its closest point of approach to my position.  It also appeared to stop or turn away from my position like the first, climb and penetrate the 5000’ cloud deck and fade from sight.  The entire event took approximately 4 minutes from visually acquiring the first object to the second object’s fade from sight.  My best estimates of their velocity would be in the 60-120 knot range.  I estimate this based on the position of the object above the horizon in relation to the cloud deck which I estimated to be at approximately 5000’. There was no sound associated with the objects, as mentioned above they emitted a tremendous amount of light energy with flickering similar to a flare. I was able to train a high power telescope on the second object and saw nothing but a pulsating light that I would have reported as a flare if the trajectory had not been what it was. I currently work as a professional offshore pilot in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean.  I have seen flares, fighter jets afterburners at night, oil rig burn offs, boat fires, large shooting stars breaking apart, plane crashes and countless other night time lights and phenomena.  I am convinced that this was none of these. Doing my best to confirm that I did not witness the flare of a vessel in distress, I spoke with the local Coast Guard Sector.  As I was explaining what I observed, the Petty Officer Cut me off mid sentence and asked if I think I saw a UFO.  I advised I was not sure when he told me that he just received a report from another source in the same area of an identical sighting and it was being reported as a UFO.  I placed calls with all of the local Air Force and FAA airspace controllers, who all reported no operations in the area.  I followed up with the Coast Guard on the December 26th, who advised there were no further developments with this case. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and we suspect that the person is a superlative witness.  We would welcome reports from the other witnesses present, or from anyone else in the Sarasota, who may have been witness to the same event.  PD));27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151

We were going south on US;2012-07-04 22:30:00;2 minutes;It was July 4th 2012 (last night) my husband, our 2 girls and I were coming home from watching the fireworks.  We were going south on US41 close to Bee Ridge Rd.  I was driving and to my left I saw 2 bright red lights flying in the sky. I said to my husband “what the heck is that?” He looked up and said “what the hell!”    At first I told him maybe it’s a plane and as he and I kept looking the way they were flying was not normal.  They were apart at first flying together at the same pace and that’s when I thought it was the tips of an airplanes wing, then they got very close together almost touching.  After that they kind of just were sporadically moving around.  Once that was over one stayed real bright the other dimmed down and took off going north, the other still very bright kind of just turned off and went the same direction “North”.   It sounds like a lot but only lasted about 2 min.   They were about the size of a star but a little bigger.  Bright red looked like! a fireball. I tried to take a picture with my phone but it didn’t turn out so great.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151

Bright red solid lights in sky - two;2013-10-18 21:30:00;2-3 minutes;Bright red solid lights in sky - two I got home today between 9:30 and 9:45 and saw what I thought was a phone/electric tower where there hadn't been one with a red light above and one below.   At first, I thought something had gone up while I'd been at work - it was odd but I was trying to justify what I was seeing.  But, as I drove through my neighborhood, it changed positions.  By the time I was at our house, the two lights had switched and were no longer one on top of the other, they were now one to the right and one to the left.  They'd reversed their positions and were a good distance apart but barely moving or shifting.  They were bright red like super, super bright.  There was no sound, no blinking lights, just solid - brighter than the north star lights.  They suddenly started to fade out like a flashlight slowly dimming but the effect was like they were going farther away and suddenly - blip - they were gone.  It was super weird. I've never seen red lights like these and I'm used to seeing passing planes, helicopters...all sorts of man made planes but they were absolutely silent and moving slowly.   I know about a minute after they vanished I saw what looked like a normal jet appear way up high because it actually had blinking lights.  The jet itself was the normal barely seen lights which gave me a good comparison.  These were shockingly red and solid.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151

I suddenly saw 6 different hot air balloon looking fireballs in the air.  I have attached a picture of two as by the time I could take a picture of the others they moved out of my camera range. At first I thought that they might be hot air balloons as I could see fire beneath them.  The problem was that if they were hot air balloons the fire would likely make the balloons rise but would not send them on a horizontal trajectory. I did call the local balloon company here in Sarasota and they confirmed that they did not have any night flights and that it would be highly unlikely that any pilots would fly at night. Interesting, what did I see?;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
6-7 red fireballs, seen moving through the sky over Sarasota,  Florida.;2014-01-27 08:00:00;3 minutes;6-7 red fireballs, seen moving through the sky over Sarasota,  Florida. I saw the first 2, coming from the east, then the 3rd one appeared. I ran and grabbed my cell phone, and hollered at my cousins.  My video starts with the 3rd object, and then the 4th and 5th, appear to the east.   It was cloudy and there was a lite mist.  The objects were red and glowing, moving from the east to west, kind of floating.  But they were moving in a line, and they suddenly veered to the north northeast.  Couldn't hear any sound.   They were approximately 5 - 15 miles out.   They finally moved out of sight, and that was it. I have the video.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
