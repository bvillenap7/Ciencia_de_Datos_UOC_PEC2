A beacon-like light extended outward and toward the  North...The object moved slowly and downward across the sky and then disappeared leaving only the haze or mist which lasted for a few more seconds ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the cluster of reports that appear her for the evening of Monday, June 25, 2001, were caused by the launch of an ICBM by the U. S. Navy from the Kennedy Space Center at approximately 2115 hrs. (EDT).  We are grateful to the FAA Military Liason office in Jacksonville, FL the USAF 45th RANDS unit and the Naval Operations and Testing Unit (NOTU) for their assistance in our attempt to determine the cause of these reports.  A similar test was conducted by the USS West Virginia submarine off the east coast of Florida on March 07, 1998, which caused similar reports.  PD));27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
Triangle shape with light at each point.;2002-01-15 19:35:00;6 min;Triangle shape with light at each point. While driving east,I noticed a large grey triangular object in the sky at about 45 degrees from me view.I watched it for a while.It seemed to hover without a sound.As  drove by some large trees I tried to keep an eye on it.I did for a while,then i passed by a rather large tree that blocked my view of the sky.As my view was renewed the object was gone.I looked around for it at different sky angle but could not find it.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
((HOAX??))  Two craft with seven orange lights on each, and a vague, dark triangular shape that housed the lights.;2008-06-23 21:45:00;5 minutes;Two craft with seven orange lights on each, and a vague, dark triangular shape that housed the lights. I was out riding my bicycle when i noticed an odd orange glowing orb over a large span of forest to the East, resting just above the treeline. The light has never been there before in any of my previous night time bike rides, so my attention was captured. Then a tree got in the way and I couldn't seem to find the light again, I even doubled back to where I had last been able to see it, but it was gone. I then looked to the other side of the road. It was here that I saw the first of the two crafts. It was travelling low and to the South at a very slow speed. It gave off a very low humming noise almost like a ver muted engigine, but unlike any engine I've ever heard, especially at such a low altitude. There were seven orange lights placed at distinct locations on the craft. Five were in a row in the central region of the craft and the other two were placed so the seven lights looked like a cross with the short horizontal line at an angle. The lights are represnted by the o. -o- -o--o--o------o--o- -o-  The triangular shape seemed to mirror the shape of the lights, however that is hard to illustrate for you as i did for the lights... The craft moved from the right to left as you view the illustration. Then I lost sight of the craft for four to five seconds as I made a ninety degree turn onto another street. In this very short stretch of time, the craft had gone from flying parallel with me towards the south, to flying parallel with me to the west. Then I came to an area with ponds on both sides of the road, permitting a large area of sight on all sides of me. As I glanced to the left to see if there were any more of these ships, I saw another further away but also flying parallel with my cycling to the west. It looked exactly the same, only the two lights out of line were in the opposite position and it had a red light (illustrated by X) as well. Looking like this: -o- -o--o--X---o--o--o- -o-  This craft flew from left to right, as you view the diagram. None of the lights flashed or fluttered at any point during the experience. Then the two ships sped up slightly and disappeared over the horrizon. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax.  Date is flawed.  Student report.  PD));27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151

Triangular U.F.O. hovers near a main road, then over a neighborhood.;2011-11-10 01:00:00;5 minutes;Triangular U.F.O. hovers near a main road, then over a neighborhood. As I was on my way home from a 24hour gym, I approached an intersection by my house to see the two people in the car perpendicular to me were pointing at something out of their car window.  I look up to what they are pointing at and I see, what appears to be a triangle shaped object with white lights on each vertex.  In the center of the triangle three red alternating lights were blinking.  As the craft moved, it made no sound, so I immediately ruled out it was a helicopter or a small aircraft.  As it descended closer to the tree line, it reflected the light of a street lamp and the shape was different than from when I initially saw it.  The craft almost resembled a triangular boomerang.  Then it moved over the trees and disappeared into thin air.  Thinking I was crazy and sleep deprived, I drove on and continued into my neighborhood.  Nonetheless, I look up out of my driver’s side window and I see the lights of the craft right above the tree line.  I slow down my car and roll down my window to double check if it was a helicopter.  The craft the completely silent also seemed to hover and slow down when I did. I turned a corner and it followed me briefly for approximately 50 yards.  That’s when I looked at the road for split second to make sure I wasn’t going to hit anything and when I looked up the craft was way off in front of me probably a half to a quarter mile away.  I continued watching it until the trees blocked my view.  As I got home, I got out of my car and looked for it in my driveway since my house is at a slightly higher elevation than the street.  The u.f.o was gone.  This sighting freaked me out, and I know I’m not crazy, but I know what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Triangle with lights seen moving south along us 41 sarasota;2012-03-10 19:00:00;4 min;triangle with lights seen moving south along us 41 sarasota While driving down US 41 not far from our home my wife and I notice an interesting set of lights in a triangular shape.  On one corner was a red light that blinked at longer intervals than the other two white lights at the other corners.  The white lights blinked back and forth quickly and the the blinked once every few times the white ones alternated.  A green light that bursted three blinks at a time was located between the white lights along that side of the triangle. Upon first seeing the craft it was stationary.  It moved the first time real quickly from its sitting position like it had no need to build thrust with the air like a hovering helicopter would have to do.  It only moved a short distance and stopped again.  I had meanwhile called my cousin to see if he could see it but his house was too far away to view the object probably due to the object not being high enough in the air and clouds.  I also had pulled over into a parking lot so I could remain seeing it as long as possible. When I pulled over it moved slowly but at a decent rate southward.  My wife and eye watched it for another minute or so as it moved behind trees in the distance.  We didn't want to actually believe we saw that but the fact is we did and I felt it needed reported.  Others had to have seen the object for sure because many people were out and about but I figured not that many people care enough to report these things.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
Triangle bright light, hovering low altitude.;2016-01-06 05:45:00;15 minutes plus;Triangle bright light, hovering low altitude. I was walking my dog and I noticed the bright moon in the sky, brighter than usual. When the cloud below the moon moved I realized that the brightness was increased by the shiny object below the moon.   From my angle which was to the right of the moon and object, the object appeared to be a triangle (teepee-shaped) and it had the glow of the moon on it, a bright white light, or it might have had its own light source.   It hovered and it did not move, there were no towers or radio stations in this field of vision so it struct me as something totally foreign.  The triangle was much lower than the altitude of a plane. I lost vision of it when the cloud moved and covered it up again.   CORRECTED DATE;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151

They changed colors red and blue periodically but mostly stayed white.  They had a little glow around each object as well. No sound and no movement for the 20 minutes observed that morning.

Triangular craft silently glided right over my head when i was in the car;2021-07-08 10:30:00;~1 minute;Triangular craft silently glided right over my head when i was in the car I was driving home from the gym pulling back into my neighborhood late at night.  There were no other cars or people out as it was past 10:00.  When I was headed down my street toward my house I noticed a set of three lights aligned in a triangular pattern.  The lights came from the northeast and were moving toward the southwest.  As the craft was overhead I stopped my car and looked up at it.  It was moving extremely slow but very smoothly like it was just gliding over the ground.  The weirdest part is that this set of triangular moving lights made no sounds whatsoever.  I had the AC turned off, the radio turned off, and I even opened the car door for a second to see if I could hear what it was when I was getting freaked out.  The whole time nothing, not even the slightest sound.  When I looked really closely I realized that the craft was basically in the shape of a perfect triangle.  Eventually it glided so far I couldn't see it anymore.  I don’t know what! this could have been but it was completely silent and flying so low to the ground like maybe 100 feet off the roofs of the houses along the street it couldn't have been a drone, a plane, or a satellite.  I have literally no explanation for this but I know what I saw.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
