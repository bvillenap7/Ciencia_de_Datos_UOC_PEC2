Small black object following airliner within its contrail;2000-10-14 18:15:00;3 minutes;Small black object following airliner within its contrail While seated at an outdoor restaurant on the Gulf of Mexico, myself and two dinner companions observed what appeared to be a widebody commercial airliner, silver in color, heading north at cruising speed, at an altitude of perhaps 10,000-15,000 feet.  Behind the aircraft a very clearly defined contrail extended for perhaps 1/4 to 1/2 mile.  Towards the tail end of the contrail, there appeared a black object about the size of an automobile.  This object followed the aircraft at a fixed distance, always remaining perfectly centered within the contrail.  No wings or control surfaces were visible on the object, but it appeared metallic in composition because it seemed to reflect the light from the sun, which was low on the horizon. It was difficult to determine the exact shape of the object because it was engulfed in the vapor trail, but it was consistently visible and did not disappear at any point during the time the aircraft was in sight.  Other patrons nearby immediately noticed the object, despite that I had only pointed at the aircraft and did not mention the UFO.  One person commented that it was as if the aircraft was towing the black object, although no towing cable was visible.  During the course of the sighting, the contrail rapidly dispersed about 100 feet behind the black object, leaving no evidence of the aircraft's passage.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
During a severe storm this  looked like a fire in the sky;2009-06-29 21:15:00;9 minutes;During a severe storm this  looked like a fire in the sky Fire in the Sky   Date June 29, 2009 time at first sighting 9:15 PM EDT  This was during a severe thunderstorm that contained heavy winds,and rain that was mixed with fairly large hail at times. I was watching TV from my couch when the electricity went off. I then opened the 2 windows in front of  this couch to let in the cool air from the storm. As I knelt there, watching the storm through the screen, my eye caught a flash of color in all this dark greyness. The palms were being whipped by the ,at times,40 to 50 mph wind and the other trees branches were swaying so anything not tied down would have been whisked away. Angle of  Observation In  the front of  the house is a large tree at the bottom of the driveway. The house rises at a 30 degree angle up from the road and base of the tree. Looking out through a gap in this tree was,. what I thought,.. a plane on fire surely hit by lightning during this storm. This is key now, my reasoning being there is nothing but big open sky beyond this tree at the altitude of my line of sight. This is upwards almost another 30 degree angle at  most. This bright fiery thing was not very high up but lower than the glider people that fly over our  house during tourist season.. I could not tell how far away this was from my house as I  have nothing to use as a gauge. In this area you have to go downtown, ten miles, to see anything tall only 2 buildings.that are impossible to see from here. As I watched,  this orangey red pulsating thing, our fire house sirens went off,.. so it was a plane then ? However, this thing never fell but hovered in the same spot so that it was now past 6 minutes according to my watch. If it was a plane it would not continue to hover in the same place. What troubled me a lot was, it suddenly flashed an extremely bright red around the edges..,twice,.. as if it were winking at me and my hair stood on end and I got the weirdest sensation, it knew I was watching it.  Crazy feeling. I then ran to get my little camcorder but fumbling I only got the lightning flashes and my cursing that I missed it. Result I never had a good enough look to see the whole shape of it. Going outside was a definite danger. It  did scare me so I at one point I closed the curtains. This all lasted  9 minutes. The lights came back on the storm waned and when I looked out it was gone. I wonder if anyone else saw anything that night.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151

Large Red Pulsing light over Sarasota, Florida. December 9, 2011.;2011-12-09 23:30:00;5 minutes;Large red pulsing light over Sarasota, Florida. December 9, 2011. I was sitting on my sofa watching TV, I noticed a very bright red light in the sky.  Bright enough that it distracted me from the movie.  There is a tree line across the street and the light seemed to come up from behind them.  The light was gaining altitude very slowly and the red light was pulsing.  I did not hear any noise or sounds.  There is a helicopter pad about 1-2 miles from my house.  I am very familiar with the sounds and lights as they often do night flights.  This red pulsing light immediately got my attention because it was much brighter than any of the lights I have seen from the helicopters over the past 10 years and because I have only seen much smaller white lights on the helicopters. The red pulsing light was much brighter and much larger even though it was not directly above my house.  When I saw it it seemed to move towards my house and then changed directions and moved in a north western direction. It moved quickly away and the light dimmed and went out.  I resumed watching TV and about 2 minutes later saw it again and in the same exact pattern, first moving up or gaining altitude as it moved towards my house and then away.  My son and I went outside and heard no noise at all. It was 11:30 pm and very quiet outside. When the light just went out suddenly we waited a few seconds and then returned inside. I was so surprised when only a few minutes later the entire event was repeated. This time we quickly went out and my son recorded the light with his iphone. After watching the recording we realized there were two lights in the video. We did not see any shape other then the round red light. It is very dark behind our house at night and the light was not directly over my house. There did seem to be a halo when the light was at its brightest or closest. It was pulsing and all three times it dimmed and went completely out.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
UFO as bright as star with green tail of fire over Siesta key;2012-06-16 01:26:00;1-2 mins;UFO as bright as star with green tail of fire over Siesta key Saw what looked like a very bright shooting star coming from the southeast going northwest.  It kept the same brightness across the sky and never diminished.  It had a almost fluorescent green in its tail that almost looked like a flame.   It went across sky about 90 feet in front of where I was above trees and didn't come down but went across toward water at the beach.   When it came this way, it seemed to change direction toward beach and was moving fast without dimming.  no sound. after it headed toward beach, I saw several flashes of bright white light by the water and then it was gone.  There was only one.   I waited for a bit after running in to get camera, but nothing else happened.  Wondering if anyone else saw it??

Many planes pass over our area and this did not the move like a plane.  It slowed down and then accelerated, but not unlike a helicopter would do.  I have never seen an orange glow from a helicopter.  It appeared to stand still or rotate and either way its glow was reduced.   Initially it appeared as though the helicopter was flying away from me and that would explain the light of the decreasing, but within seconds the light vanished.  I watched for two minutes after and so and saw no more lights.  I am a logical person and am hoping othe rsomeone saw this and there is an easy explanation.  Military, I don't know?  This appear to have been in the proximity east of I-75 and Fruitville Road. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
