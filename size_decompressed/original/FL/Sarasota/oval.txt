Orange-Red spherical oblong shaped craft flying in formation above DUI checkpoint shortly before New Year's eve.;2011-12-31 23:45:00;ten minutes;Orange-Red spherical oblong shaped craft flying in formation above DUI checkpoint shortly before New Year's eve. UFO report New Years 2011-2012 About an hour or so before midnight on new year’s eve 2011-2012, I walked from the parking lot of a bar near the intersection of Clark Road and South Lockwood Ridge road, because I was having social anxiety too much to be comfortable at a small concert. My driver was refusing to drive me home, so I began to walk South on Nelson Avenue. About fifteen minutes to midnight, I was walking East on Queens street and was almost at the intersection of Queens street and Tree Line Court, walking on foot, when I heard yelling from my west. I immediately saw what looked like orange red glowing orbs floating from north to south in the air above where I was walking from. The glowing orange red craft were flying in linear formation, appeared to be like loose embers from a fire caught in a draught of the wind. Later on I found out that they would have been flying directly above a local police operation, a DUI checkpoint, and it seemed that they were openly trying to communicate with the police by flying directly above them and signaling in a very similar way to how the police cars were using their light array to flag down civilians who were suspected of drinking alcohol and driving or were driving faster than was the speed limit of that street, which is 45 mph. I estimate that these craft were about the size of a mid size house flying from north to south directly above US 41 Tamaimi trail, and that I observed them from their east from where I mentioned above. I had a camera with me in my pocket so I began to take pictures, which I will send with the report. Again, to be concise, Orange-Red spherical orb shaped craft flying in formation directly above a congested area parallel to a police DUI checkpoint on New Year’s eve 2011-2012.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
Bright Orange light in night sky;2012-09-11 20:55:00;10-20 seconds;Bright Orange light in night sky Was in back yard with my dogs and I looked up and a bright orange object was moving from east to west at a speed quicker than I have seen a plane or helicopter.   As I loss view from the tree line, I looked up again towards the east and saw an identical bright orange object traveling the same path.  My first thought was these objects were on fire.  Then wondered if they were rockets or such entering the atmosphere.   Anyway, as they flew past my trees, I lost visual contact but waited several minutes to see if I might hear a crash or explosion. We live under a local flight path so have seen traditional airplanes at night.  Have seen many falling stars in this area as well.  Nothing like the fore-mentioned.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
Three large red lights hovered over neighborhood in Sarasota, FL;2016-01-04 19:30:00;5 minutes;Three large red lights hovered over neighborhood in Sarasota, FL Three objects, two close together and one followed slightly further back, north to south.  No sound, just red round lights flying not very high in the sky.   Funny thing were the sparks that seemed to drip from all three objects.   Within a minute they were same distance apart and stopped moving for matter of minutes.  Then slowly proceeded south, till they were out of sight.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151

2 Oval shaped objects in north sky.;2020-08-05 20:43:00;Don't know;2 Oval shaped objects in north sky. Last night Aug 5, 2020 I went outside around 8:30PM to water my plants.  As I was looking at them I thought I would take a picture on my phone of the front of my house because I had recently re- landscaped and was happy with the outcome.  Minutes after I took the picture I thought I would send it to my son’s so they could see how it came out.  After I sent the picture I went back to look at it myself and as I made the picture larger on my  phone I looked to the left of the larger palm in my yard and noticed 2 saucer shaped things in the sky.  They don’t appear to have color. There was no noise because if there were I believe I would have looked to my left.  I didn’t see these with my naked eye because I was focused on my front yard. I called my son’s and asked them to make the picture larger on their phones and just asked if they noticed anything, I didn’t tell them what I thought because I wanted an honest answer. They all had remarks mostly surprised at what they thought they were seeing.  I live in Sarasota Fl. These things were north of my house, right next to Interstate 75 near Exit 205.  Maybe a cloud formation maybe a reflection, I’m just not sure. Weird they are so similar in shape.;27.3605901883051;-82.5139520317151
