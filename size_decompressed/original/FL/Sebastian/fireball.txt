I was sitting in my chair, on the dock,  watching my fishing pole, which was casted in the river, when I glanced up to look at the sky. It is a pretty night tonight. I saw something glowing red-orange, approximately the size of a quarter in the sky right above a tree moving in a vertical upright motion. I ran in the house to tell my friends, and when they came out with me the remnants were a glowy orange sky in the direction of the quarter-sized glow that I had seen previously.;27.799586440678;-80.4864966101695
