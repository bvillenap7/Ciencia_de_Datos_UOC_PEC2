Orange ball over Sebastian, FL;2007-11-10 21:00:00;7 minutes;Orange ball over Sebastian, FL November 10th, 2007 approx. 9 pm   My daughter and her girlfriend, both 11 years old were outside in the yard sitting on the grass.  My daughter came running in all excited to tell me she had seen a shooting star (which she has never seen before).   I replied that was wonderful.  She said No Mom, come see it, it’s great! So I went outside, knowing full well that the shooting star would be gone.  Well, I didn’t know what to say.  The object was a pale orange ball, at least 3 times larger than a star, moving from west to east in a straight line.  It was sort of glowing.  It flashed bright at least twice. My daughter was upset when we got outside because she said it had been streaking across the sky, creating a trail behind it.   Her girlfriend who had remained outside, said it stopped and just started going slow.   We watched it for some time, until the neighbors tree obscured it.   I ran out front to the street where I could see it clear again.  It suddenly stopped and I watched it for a bit before it just vanished.;27.799586440678;-80.4864966101695
Orange Light Over Sebastian, Florida;2012-03-10 22:00:00;1 minute;Orange Light Over Sebastian, Florida Last night at around 10 pm, my wife and I were talking to a patron of a local bar about the moon shining over the Indian River Lagoon when we observed an orange light low in the sky moving from East to West.  The light appeared, moved steadily and disappeared quickly.  I checked the NASA website to see if the ISS was visible but it's not supposed to be seen until March 13th.  The light seemed low to be a satellite and made no noise.;27.799586440678;-80.4864966101695
