Last Night around 7:30pm my Wife & I saw a gray Trinagle shaped craft with no Lights or sound, traveling very fast. Couldn't tell how high it was. It appeared to be larger than a small Airplane. It was traveling from South to North. the sighting lasted about 10 seconds.;27.799586440678;-80.4864966101695
Triangle shaped craft with no sound flying over house;2002-03-11 19:30:00;20 seconds;Triangle shaped craft with no sound flying over house My Wife and I were in Front Yard around 7:30. It was Dusk and the Stars were visible. We looked up and saw a dark Triangle shaped object moving from South to North.The best way to describe would a black Triangle Siloutee. It was between 1000 to 1500 feet above us,and moving at a fast pace.It made no sound at all. My wife saw 3 dim lights on the top of each end of the Triangle. The object was bigger than a small aircraft which fly over regularly. it was moving in a straight line and finally moved off into the distance where we could not see it any more.;27.799586440678;-80.4864966101695
6 low flying craft with loud engines and 2 white lights on wings and 2 red flashing lights near center;2016-02-29 23:30:00;20-40 minutes;6 low flying craft with loud engines and 2 white lights on wings and 2 red flashing lights near center I watched a large craft with white lights on the wings and two flashing red lights near the center, one over the other flying low  over the water.  this craft made a loud noise like turbine engines would make.  sounds normal right?  wrong next thing I see is 3 of these flying in a triangle formation and circling back and forth like they were searching for something,  them 3 more craft appeared in the same area and all with the same lighting. I watched them fly back and forth for around 30 to 40 minutes.   I tried to signal one of them with my flash light and one craft shined a bright light towards me for and minute or so them 3 of these things preceded to slowly head towards the north heading for the space center and the others just vanished.   this had to be seen by many people in my area because of the noise and duration of the occurrence.;27.799586440678;-80.4864966101695
