I was out on my lanai watching July 4th fireworks with my husband, when we noticed a red-orange object flying.  It was in the opposite direction of the fireworks. At first I thought it was a space station, but I've seen them before and they were never that big or that color.  The way it flew resembled the flight path of one.  No sound. The glowing object flew over us and continued across the sky till we could no longer see it.  We commented that it was going to fast for a plane, ha ha, must be a UFO.  We were mesmerized by it. About five minutes later, we saw the exact same thing.  It flew horizon to horizon, SE-NW.  We're not laughing about it any more.;27.799586440678;-80.4864966101695

All of a sudden appeared was off to the right in the clear sky... a red ball glowing and moving slowly towards us.  It had no sound or anything just appeared very close about 1,000 feet up from the water, in the sky. moved from south from north as it approached us and then head straight east.  It moved slow like maybe 25 miles per hour. then it just moved away straight out over the Sebastian bridge.  Then the red glowing light went out.;27.799586440678;-80.4864966101695
