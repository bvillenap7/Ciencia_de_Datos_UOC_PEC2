Traveled from west to east following the horizon and disappeared behind a grey cloud. I figured it was a meteor at first but it didn't streak across the sky. I moved kinda slow. It was a large fireball. I've seen shooting stars but this was nothing like that. It was a large orange glowing object with spark's or fire shooting out from where it was coming from, moving slowly, and not losing any size like a meteor does when it burns out.;26.2681;-80.2092

I thought it was Mars and I recently saw a story on the local news about a woman in California who saw the same glowing object in the sky. I have footage of the object and the ball has a green outer layer and pinkish in the middle with little circles in the middle. Then after a while it changes to a glowing bright red and brilliant white. After a while it looks as if it was wobbling. If you would like to see the video, it has really good detail.;26.2681;-80.2092

I was standing outside of a friends house at around one in the morning to be exact.  It looked like a shooting star but it was a lot larger and moved a lot slower than one. It was bright white, moving down vertically towards the ground.  It vanished behind some trees. I didn't hear any noise and could not tell how far away it was but it left me in complete shock. It was the wierdest thing I've ever seen. About a year ago I saw fireball type of oject slowly flying across the sky, it had a trail. I've tried to look up both events but have found no information. If you've also witnessed these events here in Margate or anywhere close by please post.;26.2681;-80.2092
