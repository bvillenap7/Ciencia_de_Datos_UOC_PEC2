Not the sound of a plane or jet.  More of a vacuum hum.   Clouds covered what was making it with a slight orange glow to the clouds.  After ten minutes the clouds and orange glow disappeared.   If I were to imagine what a spacecraft sounded like, that would be it.;27.9250146788992;-82.2359660550461
