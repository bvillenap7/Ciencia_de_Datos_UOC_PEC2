A perfect row of formation lights in a line moving across the nights sky.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-23 21:25:00;3 minutes;Clear beautiful night sky with less than a half moon.  Bike riding with my kids and looked up. It literally stopped me in my tracks.  A perfect row of formation lights in a line moving across the nights sky.  By the time we stopped to look up they were already moving so Im not sure how many I missed but we did catch 10-15 lights.  The last one in the row were two gliding next to each other. They were very high up.. They looked like stars on a string silently gliding across the sky in front of the moon. It was hands down the most mind blowing screen to witness especially when you see the videos online half believing them to actually seeing it for yourself. My son got it on Snapchat (of course) I tried to record it but I'm currently regretting my decision to keep my S8 phone.. As you can guess I barely was able to catch anything. I always tell my kids to look up and say hi moon! Now it has so much more meaning to us.;27.9250146788992;-82.2359660550461
