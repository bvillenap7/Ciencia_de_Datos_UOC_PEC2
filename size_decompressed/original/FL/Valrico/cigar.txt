Cigar shaped object with no wings following Commercial Jet airliner.;2009-08-05 17:30:00;About 45seconds;Cigar shaped object with no wings following Commercial Jet airliner. I came home from my office at about 5:00PM - at about 5:30 my wife and I were outside sitting by our pond and as I leaned back in my chair I looked upward and saw a Commercial Jet and following the plane was a cigar shaped object( Silver in color) about half the size of the plane.   I said to my wife,  That looks odd because the object following the plane has no wings!  The object appeared to be about 100-150 yards behind the plane.   We watched for about 45 seconds or so until they were out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));27.9250146788992;-82.2359660550461
