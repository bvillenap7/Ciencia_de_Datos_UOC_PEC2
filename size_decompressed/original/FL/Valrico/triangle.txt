This evening around 10pm I went out to my backyard to smoke a cigarette when I noticed a very bright light in the night sky to the north of where I was standing.  At first I thought it was a star, but it seemed way too large and bright.  The object appeared to be stationary at this time.  I did see an airplane flying by in a NW direction, at what appeared to be a much lower altitude than the large light.  By comparison it's lights seemed exponentially smaller that the bright object in the sky that I was focused on. The two did not seem to interact in any way. As I watched it began to look more like 2 stars very close together, then the space between the white lights appeared to grow larger. When the horizontal distance between them reached a certain size, the object began to move south toward where I stood. At this point I knew it was not stars, so I thought it might be an airplane, but it seemed strange that it had hovered in one spot for so long before moving, not to mention the way the lights went from looking like one light only to looking like 2. As it flew over me relatively slowly, I could see it was a matte silver color, and triangle shaped with 2 larger bright white lights approximately in the center of it and 2 smaller ones that were closer together and directly behind the 2 larger ones. It did not have the flashing red or blue lights that you see on airplanes. These lights did not blink at all. I think I could hear it as it flew above me, but the noise was very low, not nearly as loud as any aircraft I've ever experienced that was flying that low. Also the sound was more of a deep low hum that the usual roar of an engine. And I think I almost felt the hum more than I could hear it. As it flew over the house. I ran back in the house, through the living room and out the front door. I should have been able to still see it somewhere in the sky, but it was nowhere to be seen. It was moving rather slowly when it flew above me, and it only took me a few seconds to get out the front door.! From my front yard the part of the sky that's visible goes on very far in every direction, there are no tall buildings blocking the view for miles on every side.;27.9250146788992;-82.2359660550461
translucent pink orange colors, bird shape, 5 of them making a formation of a triangle as they move foward on a swimming motion,;2010-08-30 05:15:00;10 seconds;translucent pink orange colors, bird shape, 5 of them making a formation of a triangle as they move foward on a swimming motion, Today August 30, 2010 clear sky and many stars, the location of the incident was in Valrico, Florida.  About 5:15 A.M this morning.   I went outside to my courtyard to drink my coffee and admired the sky like I usually do.  I have been starring at the sky for couple of minutes, when I saw what appears to me as clouds approaching but I realized that it was more like  a flock of birds flying high in the sky,(high up like a cloud) about 5 of them crossing the sky from west to east forming a like triangle.  Each bird shape appears to be like three times the size of the moon when you see it from the ground the stars appear very small next to each of them in size like dots. What I found to be strange was the color and the way they moved forward.  Their color was like the fire from a lighter translucent with a pink-orange tone the only thing I can compare them to is to clouds in the horizon when the morning is breaking through.  However keep in mind that is was still dark outside, only the moon and the stars shining.  The way they moved was like it was gliding in the sky, like swimming in the ocean.  They were out of sight in about 10 seconds. It was an incredible!;27.9250146788992;-82.2359660550461
