Numerous lights flying across the sky in a straight line and equidistant.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-30 21:15:00;20 seconds;Numerous lights flying across the sky in a straight line and equidistant Initially saw what looked like a straight line constellation over the horizon, but quickly realized they were moving. They moved steady and equidistant, north to south, except for the last which was close behind to the second-to-last and off to the right. They did not move very fast, and seemed to be very high up or smaller objects. All were in my view and another witness' view for 15 to 30 seconds before seemingly disappearing or going out of view. We live in an area with a fair amount of light pollution, so I couldn't see them trail off, it moreso seemed like they weren't there anymore. All gave off the same amount of light and I could not see an outline. There were no other lights on it, the object(s) was just one source of white light.;29.0231251269035;-80.946171573604
