I was walking my dog when he stopped.  I turned to see why, and saw he was staring into the sky.  I looked up and there were clusters of lights forming a large circle in the sky.   I want to say there were three lights to each cluster, but not sure, as it also seems there could have been more.  The object was very low to the ground, I thought, and almost directly above my dog and me.  It was very cloudy around the lights and the area in the middle of the lights, but the lights were clearly defined.  I don't remember the night being exceptionally cloudy, though, it could have been.   There was no detectable sound.   It seems like the lights were turning, but it's kind of surreal, so not sure now.  The lights were just white, no color.  It just sat in the one place.   I texted my kids about what I saw and went back into the house, and it was still there when I went in.;29.0231251269035;-80.946171573604
