I was just getting off my computer from chatting with my boyfriend and decided to step out on my balcony for a cigarette. I was looking along the horizon to the west and up into the sky at the stars and noticed an object that I had never seen there before. It was just over the tree line. I knew at once that it was either a plane or something else since it was too bright to be a star or a planet. It was spherical, bright, and appeared to have a halo or an aura around it. I kept watching it to see if it would turn towards the airport to land, but it didn't. For a good three minutes it remained stationary in the sky. Then all of a sudden it dropped in altitude and picked back up to the exact place where it was when I first saw it. It then zipped toward the north and disappeared. In the place where it disappeared, there seemed to have been a hole ripped in the clouds. I knew at this time that it must have been something not of this world, so I went inside to get my blanket and wrap up on the balcony. About five minutes passed with me sitting on the balcony watching the sky for another or the same object. Suddenly one appeared on the same place the fist one had. It had the same characteristics as the first. This craft zipped to the north and the south with ease and agility. Then it returned to the same place where it first appeared, and the light that it was emitting slowly faded. I have seen a few UFOs before, but never anything of this magnitude. My father had once described the same phenomenon to me, except the craft was much closer to him. There was the same agility and the same aura to the object. He also reported that the craft shot up into the air and that there was a hole in the clouds from where it passed through.;29.0231251269035;-80.946171573604

As we were sitting there talking about the days events, we both noticed a large green (glowing green) orb float down from the sky.  It went behind a cloud, and, just like that, it was gone.
