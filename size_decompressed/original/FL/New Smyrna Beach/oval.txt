Orange orb over Atlantic Ocean in New Symnra Beach during unorganized firework show.;2010-07-04 20:35:00;4 mins;Orange orb over Atlantic Ocean in New Symnra Beach during unorganized firework show. At 20:35 on July 4th 2010 while sitting by the hot tub at the Tradewinds Condos in New Symrna Beach myself and 4 friends observed an orange orb in the sky.  It was positioned due east of the condo and was just coming into our field of vision to the right of the condo building on our left.  I rushed to the video camera and by the time I was able to get it on and open it disappeared.  That video is also available.  At 22:15 July 4th 2010 while standing on the 8th floor balcony of the Tradewinds Condos in New Symrna Beach the orange orb again appeared.  Myself and L were observing fireworks when it was noticed moving at a high speed from 9 o'clock to 12 o'clock.  When the object came to 12 o'clock from us, due east, it froze and remained there.  At this point I ran back into the condo to tell our other friends and to grab the video camera.  I began filming as soon as I returned to the balcony and attached is that film unmodified.  The orb was due east over the water and far higher than the fireworks that were being launched from the beach.  If I picture my body sideways looking out to the east as the hands of a clock positioned at 6 o'clock, my head as 12 and my feet were 6 raising my left arm to point to the object placed it to be at the 2 of a clock.  The object was oval in shape with a circular center of brightness in the distal 1/3rd of the oval.  The color that it was emitting was orange in the proximal 2/3rd and bright yellow orange in the distal 1/3rd.  The distal 1/3rd of the object was pulsating with light and at times appeared brighter yellow to white, and pulsed back and forth to yellow orange.  In order to get a close reference my friend S stood in front of me while filming approximately 1 and a half feet from the end of the camcorder.  At this point the object is viewed directly over her head and behind her toward the east over the ocean.  We observed this oval orb for about 1 minute with our first sighting and for approximately 3 minutes during our second sighting.  There was only one orb spotted during each sighting.  I myself am a University of Miami alumni with studies in Science and Physics. I currently work in the Medical profession as a consultant for orthopaedic devices.;29.0231251269035;-80.946171573604
Saw several  orange lights moving.;2017-12-11 20:00:00;4 minutes;saw several  orange lights moving At 20:00 hrs on December 11, 2017 walking to my condo in Pine Valley, New Smyrna Beach, with my wife, we saw several orange coloured objects in the sky moving together in a south easterly direction.  I would say there would have been about a dozen of these objects. One of them seemed to us to descend rapidly to earth.;29.0231251269035;-80.946171573604
