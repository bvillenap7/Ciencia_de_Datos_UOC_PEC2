Bluish ball of light observed at New Smyrna Beach Florida. Possible bolide.;2005-08-09 23:45:00;3 to 4 sec;Bluish ball of light observed at New Smyrna Beach Florida. Possible bolide. At approximately 23:45 my friend and I were on the boardwalk at New Smyrna Beach watching lightening over the ocean. A storm had just passed through an hour before and was off shore. We noticed a large turqouise-colored ball of light, surrounded by a haze, streaking silently from north to south over the ocean, in the direction of the Kennedy Space Center about 14 miles to the south. The object was the size of a quarter held at arm's length and had a long, hazy, bluish tail. What was curious was the object's bluish color, unlike any colors of comets or meteors I have seen, and that it seemed to move slower than a comet. Our observation time was about 3 or 4 seconds before the object vanished. I would surmise that we witnessed a bolide and that atmospheric conditions were responsible for the odd color.;29.0231251269035;-80.946171573604
Fireball and explosion in the sky over N. Central Florida.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably not a meteor.  PD));2011-07-22 23:00:00;30 seconds;Fireball and explosion in the sky over N. Central Florida The night of July 22nd I was walking Southward on my street toward a CVS and happened to be looking up into the sky as I walked. Around 3 minutes into the walk, I noticed a bright orange object traveling in a Westerly direction very quickly before seeming to explode.  The incident lasted long enough for me to catch it out of the top corner of my eye, look up to see it traveling West for under 5 seconds, then burst like an explosion. It was very different than witnessing a typical shooting star as the light was a red orange, quite fiery looking, and rather than blinking out of existence it first exploded quite clearly. I can say for sure this was not a fireworks display, as it all happened in utter silence and with no surrounding exploding debris.  It also looked much too far away, too high up, to be any fireworks display and did not resemble any fireworks I have encountered. This could quite probably have been a meteorite exploding upon entry into our atmosphere, but an incident witnessed in the same area the following night by several people including my brother and mother have caused me to look upon it with curiosity.

Red flame- like substance with white tightly packed filaments protruding moving along New Smyrna Beach shoreline after 11:00.;2012-12-12 23:24:00;2 minutes;Red flame- like substance with white tightly packed filaments protruding moving along New Smyrna Beach shoreline after 11:00. My cousin and I (70 and 74 yrs old) were watching TV in our rental by New Smyrna Beach, Fl.  Immediately off shore and a little higher than our seven floor building, I saw something I had never seen in my lifetime---A slowly and steadily moving object that resembled a rectangular shape that appeared to have the likeness of orangish fire..    At one end of the shimmering so called fire--for want of a better word--there protruded a luminous dull white--as if they were filaments that were closely packed together.  All of what was visible was as big as the front quarter of a fuselage of a small plane.  However,  as I watched it, I had the feeling that there was more to its size than the shimmering/fiery orange I could see in the darkness.   After we saw it, the object seemed  to speed up and rise slowly as it moved south along the beach.  It then disappeared. I must repeat, I have never seen anything like it. It looked like flame, yet I somehow knew it wasn't.  The flame didn't spread, and had it been a plane on fire, it would have spread! It also moved silently, and we were ! close enough to hear a motor had there been one. I also sensed that the object wasn't solid.;29.0231251269035;-80.946171573604
