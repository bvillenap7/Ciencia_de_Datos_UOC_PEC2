My Fiancé and I were traveling west on a straight stretch of Pioneer Trail about 3-4 miles from Tomoka Farms Road.  We first spotted it about the 1 o’clock position in the sky, it was extremely bright and looked like we were looking at the side of a disc with the sun reflecting off of it, however it was glowing on the bottom of the craft as well.  I asked my fiancé if it could be a plane, but we both decided it definitely was not due to it’s erratic quick movement from north to south in an instant to about 10 o’clock in the sky.  It never got any smaller like it was traveling away from us.  It then made an track to about 3 o’clock in a second or two, and then vanished.  We were both a little shocked because we only counted one small cloud in a blue sky.  And we could find where it went.  Later on we saw airliners flying over and instantly knew we had seen something anomalous.;29.0231251269035;-80.946171573604
