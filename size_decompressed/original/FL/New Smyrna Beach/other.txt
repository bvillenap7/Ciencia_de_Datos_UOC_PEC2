Cloud ships over Bethune Beach.;2014-06-24 11:30:00;2.5 hours;Cloud ships over Bethune Beach While walking on Bethune Beach, I noticed a smallish cloud.  I wondered if it was a cloud-ship because of its odd shape and that it wasn’t moving.   As I sat at the picnic tables I noticed that 2 larger clouds moved from the west to east and layered themselves above the smaller cloud.  Each progressively larger.  Once in that position they absolutely did not move for over 2 hours. They were situated directly above the shoreline. Also, a helicopter came from the north and once it got just south of these “clouds” it hovered in place for at least 2 minutes.  It is not unusual for helicopters to travel from the Coast Guard Station (at the inlet) to Patrick Air Force Base, however this was a very different helicopter, it was flying much slower than they usually do and in all my years I have never seen one stop and hover. People took note of the helicopter, but I honestly don’t believe anyone else took note of the “clouds.”  They were still in place when I left at 14:00 (2 p.m.). There were 2 other anomalies in the sky at the same time, but I will keep this limited to the UFOs.;29.0231251269035;-80.946171573604
