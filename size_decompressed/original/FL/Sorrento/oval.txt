On January 30, 2008 in Sorrento, Florida, near the Lake/Orange County Line, my wife and I saw what appeared to be a blimp that glowed like a light bulb, with primarily red lights along the center beam and on top center & bottom center there was one green light on the starboard side (based on the direction it was traveling). It was traveling in a SSE direction. I took photos, due to the range I did not zoom in. So they donâ€™t do the object justice. Let me know where to send a copy of the best photo taken. It was within view for approximately 8-10 minutes, until we lost visual over the trees.;28.8024;-81.5316
