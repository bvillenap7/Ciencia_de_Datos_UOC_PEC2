My wife and I with our children where in the car coming back from a day trip. When my son saw something in the sky about mabey one hundred yards off the ground. My wife and I both saw it and drove closer to it we were about a mile away at that time. We got as close to it as we could on the road then pulled over and got out of the car. It was a cigar shaped craft floating in the air. The craft had lights flashing on it we watched it for a min or two the it dissapered and we noticed it about a mile or two away for about 10 seconds then reappeared in the first place we saw it. It made no noise and was unlike any other aircraft I had ever seen. It looked like it was moving away from us and we lost sight of it so we got back it the car and I drove into the woods to try to see it but we never saw it again.
