Unidentified Super Bright Light Ball.;2013-12-08 20:30:00;15+ minutes;Unidentified Super Bright Light Ball Between 20:30 and 20:45 Eastern on December 8, 2013 I drove to the local grocery store. On the way there I didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary in the sky.  Upon leaving the store, approximately 5 minutes later, I immediately noticed the brightest light I have ever seen in the night sky other than the moon in the same direction as I had just traveled not noticing anything.  I watched for a moment in the parking lot as it seems to pulse between orange and gold colors with very little motion. I decided since I lived near open water that I would drive to the water’s edge and get a better look. As I drove along the tree canopied roads it was hard to keep a good eye on but at one point it seemed that there was something that resembled a light beam from the bottom.  This made me think this was possibly a coast guard helicopter or something but continued to get the unobstructed view at the water’s edge. To my surprise the object was no helicopter, completely silent and so bright that the light from it reflected clearly off the calm water.  I snapped the best picture I could with my phone but it is obviously not made for detail at a distance.  Object was located WNW of Homosassa, FL, with a slight drift toward the south. Low elevation, 1000-1500 ft max would be my best guess.  If it was more then a few miles offshore it would have had to be of massive size based on the sheer amount of light being produced. Slight color changes between a golden yellow and orange happened periodically but not in a certain amount of time.  Weather was 80 degrees, wind under 5mph and variable, crystal clear skies.;28.7599333333333;-82.5227666666666

It was a military chopper flying maybe 200 ft off the ground.   I was confused when I saw it chasing a orange light at a fast rate.  Not as if it was chasing, but more as following. ..the light was very small in size to the helicopter;28.7599333333333;-82.5227666666666
Bright light, mostly white, which appeared to be able to move left to right, and up and down.;2018-05-28 19:00:00;30 minutes;Bright light, mostly white, which appeared to be able to move left to right, and up and down. My nephew called me outside at night, just after the storms and rain seemed to clear.  We saw as we were facing south, to the west a very bright light just above the tree line.  It was mostly stationary, so at first we thought it was a star.  However this appeared to be larger than any of the other stars.  It appeared to get brighter and larger so I went to get my telescope. Once I got the scope and had it lined up the light dipped slowly down then dimmed and went dark.  I put the telescope down and when I did it reappeared got real bright, and appeared to move to the left, then the right.  As I set my telescope up again and my nephew tried to video it, it dipped down into the tree line.  Then it dimmed and disappeared completely.  Attempts to video or take pictures were unsuccessful.  The object appeared to me to have blue and green on top and was mostly bright white. The blue and green seemed to alternate. No sound was noted.;28.7599333333333;-82.5227666666666
