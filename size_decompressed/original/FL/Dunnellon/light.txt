Four spinning light beams moving in a circle traveling southeast.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising light?  PD));2007-01-13 10:10:00;2 min;Four spinning light beams moving in a circle traveling southeast. 4 Large circle (disk) object circling and moving.  All four object (lights) were moving in circles individually but also were all spining together in a circle and traveling southeast. Looked as though the lights were reflecting throught the clouds. We couldn't see where the lights were coming from. Just know that it wasn't a spot light type movement where the light beam could be seen. The light beam was coming in a downward movement.

Long time disturbance.;2017-11-21 01:00:00;20 years;long time disturbance latest was 21 nov night, I saw a bright star out of place...or maybe I felt it I don't know...strange feeling... I was afraid, I know the feeling , like goosebumps, electric feeling in spine.Hard to remember.  Always the same, fuzzy memories, like waking from a hangover.  woke up with pain in ear, strange smell like ammonia.  It's hard to explain.  I always thought it was a dream, nightmare.  Last year I got a dog to help, he pissed the floor and bit me when I touched him in morning.  This has gone on as long as I can remember but now I know it is not a dream.  Need to know if I can kill it.  I don't know what it is but nothing has ever made me so afraid, I'm sure it does not mean me well.  I am a combat veteran who served with the 82nd airborne in Iraq 03-04 and do not scare easily.  I had a memory come back to me a few years ago of one in my room, only time I can recall seeing it, small dark thin, it knew I  saw it and I blacked out.  I don't know if I'm repressing the memories or if I'm bat shit.  It is almost painful to try to remember and normally give up and go about my life.  Lately, I wake up with bruises, cuts, rashes...allergic reactions.  At this point I am going to try to kill them, set traps and sleep with dog and gun.  I wish I could put more in here, but it's like i'm in a fog when I try.  Please help me to understand what is happening.  And do you know if anyone has had success defending themselves and if so how. Thanks ((name deleted));29.067077027027;-82.4429675675676
