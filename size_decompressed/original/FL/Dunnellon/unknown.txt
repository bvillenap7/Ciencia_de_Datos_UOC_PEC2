Illuminated satellite like object that turned multiple times at extremely high altitude;2019-09-30 01:45:00;5 minutes;Illuminated satellite like object that turned multiple times at extremely high altitude Unknown single craft at extremely high altitude multiple lights? (illuminated) in southeast sky, travelling southwest when first noticed, I thought it was a satellite crossing the sky until it turned multiple times (similar to a helicopter) but proceeded in same general southwest course. I would estimate altitude of 30-thousand feet.  After watching for 5-minutes I ran inside to get binoculars but when I got back out two minutes later I could not find it. I continued watching the sky for another hour but could not find the object again.;29.067077027027;-82.4429675675676
