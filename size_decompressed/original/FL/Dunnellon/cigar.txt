Dunnellon, Fl, approximately 10.30 a.m. 1/9/2020, in the neighborhood of THE WOODLANDS. Object sited above SW 102 ST. RD and U.S. 41. Object was rectangular shaped, silver/metallic in color, with a dome(?) below it. Object moved in the northerly direction, silently. I took 2 photos, one of the entire object in full view before it disappeared behind the tree line, and the second picture of it moving past the tree line. The second pic only shows the nose of the object appearing from behind the tree line and a small portion of the lower dome(?) Upon reviewing my phone pics, on the second pic was in my phone. Encounter occurred 1/4 mile from S.W. 102 ST. RD and HWY 41. I then turned left on S.W. 102 ST. RD. to find the object. An object this size would have been easily spotted OR seen OR heard along 102 ST. RD. Yet I found no trace of the object anywhere along 102 ST. RD or within the neighborhood, although I drove around for five minutes looking for it.  I have emailed five pics of the object to ufocntr@nwlink.com.;29.067077027027;-82.4429675675676
