On 6/21/2014 at 22:54, I was smoking a cigarette outside my house facing my garage.  Out of no wear, I herd a horrific sound coming from behind me.  I turned around a seen a huge ship moving very slow coming towards me.  I froze at first, it was in the shape of a triangle. I garbed my cell phone (Galexcy S5) and recorded a 45-second video. After I lost site with it reviewed the video.  To my amazement it recorded first 3 sec and last 10 sec of video.  It had three white lights on each corner of the ship.  The only color of the ship was black and looked very smooth.  The size of it was…. Huge.  I don’t know how to put it size.  If I had to guess I would say 100-200 ft per side of triangle.  It was heading south in direction.   I got a overwhelming sense of fear went to grab my .45 handgun that was sitting on the table a few feet from me.  What really creep me out was that one of the bullets on my gun was sitting out side of the gun next to it on table.   Sorry just out of words at this point.;29.067077027027;-82.4429675675676
