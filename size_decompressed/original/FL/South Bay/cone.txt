((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be seemingly quite level headed and serious minded.  The object, he reports, was approximately 70 degrees above the southwestern horizon, so we suspect that it was not the planet, Venus, which otherwise would have been our first guess.  We will attempt to post the illustration to our website.  PD));26.6701;-80.7312
