Marianna, Fl, Football shaped object close to I-10;2002-04-04 15:30:00;1 min, +or -;Marianna, Fl, Football shaped object close to I-10 It was shaped like an elongated football. Exactly like a football execpt narrower in the center. It appeared to be chrome or silver with no windows. It was just one of them, and it was about 300 feet in the air to the north of interstate 10. It was moving east, just as I was, but it was ahead of me, and I was actually moving faster than it(75 mile an hour). It was moving strait eastward alongside the interstate. There were many cars on the road at the time going in both directions. No one stopped to look. I dont know if anyone was paying attention, or if they were, as I was, fearful of it.
