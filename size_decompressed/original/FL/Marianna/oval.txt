Initially I thought that it was a small plane but when I looked directly at it I realized that it was just a dark oval shape moving in the sky.  It made no sounds and had no distinguishing features.   After a few seconds it as no longer visible to me.  There was one passenger in the car who also saw the same thing.We agreed not to tell anyone for fear of  being ridiculed but we know that we saw it.

It was flying west to east. It was incredible... I would say the thing was aprox 2000 feet up. The color was almost the color of the night sky but yet some what translucent if that makes any sence.The object had no lights. The lights from across the road aluminated it some what. The thing was flying what appeared at a slight angle. With more of the bottom of the aircraft tilted towards My husband and I. You could see what appeard to be things on the bottom side bubbles like half globes. This is not describing it very well. Wish I could draw somthing to show you what I mean. God I know this sounds crazy. If I had not seen it and anyone else told me this I would tell them they were crazy. This thing was no Plane it was a solid mass. The night was beautiful. I saw this thing.I want to know what it is.;30.7598;-85.2218516129032
