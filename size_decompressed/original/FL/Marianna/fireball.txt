Probable space junk falling to earth;2011-04-29 21:05:00;5 seconds;Probable space junk falling to earth I was on Interstate 10 travelling east near Marianna at 9:05 PM (in Central but near the Eastern time zone) when a very bright green fireball moved across the sky in a smooth trajectory in a WNW to ESE direction.  The fireball extinguished itself in midfilight after a brighter pinkish flash.   The event took about 4 or 5 seconds.   At first I thought it was ordnance from Eglin AFB or Tyndall AFB but the location (North of I10) and direction of its path negated that.  It seemed to fit other descriptions of space junk falling to earth (e.g., slow and green).  Interestingly, the first observer (in Jacksonville) stated that the object was falling toward the west, whereas I (near Marianna) observed it moving generally toward  the east.   It moved from left to right, about three-quarters of the way up my driver's window, as my vehicle moved east.   I was focused on driving, so didn't observe any other associated phenomena.  It was brief, fascinating and cool!;30.7598;-85.2218516129032
