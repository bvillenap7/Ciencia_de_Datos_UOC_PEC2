Fast and Silent Object(s) Flying in the Presence of a Military Aircraft;2007-04-12 20:53:00;12 sec.;Fast and Silent Object(s) Flying in the Presence of a Military Aircraft UFO sighting I have observed happened 4/12/07 on or near 8:53pm EDT heading approximately 240 T deg. near location of I-95 and CR 210, St. Aug., FL while walking my dog. Specifics are that a US Navy prop refueler flew an approach overhead for possible landing at the NAS, Jacksonville, FL, less than 1 minute prior to this sighting. Also a commercial air carrier was heading approx. 005 T degrees, some 25,000+ ft. altitude, 15 seconds before this sighting. The elevation of the object was difficult to estimate however it was higher than the refueler and appeared lower than the commercial jet aircraft. I could hear the engines of both identifiable aircraft however the UFO was completely silent traveling 4 to 5 times faster than the commercial jet. It had 4 round amber lights arranged in a semi-circular pattern with a slight flickers, similar to a star flicker. The lights appeared at a point of about 45 degrees azimuth eastward (facing southeast) and stayed lit to about 45 degrees azimuth southwestward. As a seasoned celestial sailor with many months of night sailing, I have never seen this type of light arrangement nor the speed and silence they displayed. I have observed the ISS pass eastward overhead about a month ago from this same spot and am familiar with itâ€™s light reflection and speed. I would think it reasonable to say a radar signal would be more apparent on a military aircraft than one on commercial aircraft radar of such a flying object.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
7 Bright Lights in sky in straight line formation.... can't verify as spacex due to geopgraphic location.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-13 19:00:00;3 minutes;7 Bright Lights in sky in straight line formation.... can't verify as spacex due to geopgraphic location. While walking outside to my barn I looked up into a clear starry sky trying to see satellites as we normally do on a clear evening, there is little light pollution where we live. I saw two satellites immediately but they were in a straight line formation. On a South-Southwest to North-Northeast trajectory passing at about 75 to 80 degrees overhead. Soon after there were two more in a straight formation.  I ran back inside and grabbed my cell phone to video them.  When I came back out the first two satellites were cover by clouds and the second two were still visible. Then the fifth and sixth appeared on the same line but spaced further back, then number seven which was trailing slightly. I have never saw a formation like this and tried to debunk it thinking it was the SpaceX train passing over but from all the research I can find they are not readily visible from my location. They were very bright and high as a airliner flew below them. travelling in a strai! ght line. I do not believe they were alien but unexplained, for now, yes. I would like to think someone has seen the same thing as they were very bright. Brighter than any satellites I have observed.  Military aircraft do occasionally fly in the area but they are usually helicopters doing night training from NAS Jacksonville. I videoed the satellites but of course it is pitch black.... not sure how to edit it to see if I can get them visible. please email back to verify if it was spacex or other Satellites that travel in a straight line formation and appear very bright in the night sky.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
