Hovering Sphere over the ocean;1988-06-01 21:00:00;2 minutes;Hovering Sphere over the ocean My then girlfriend and I were sitting on the beach and talking. My girlfriend looked away out to the water and had a surprised look on her face. I turned to see what she was looking at and there was a sphere that seemed to be about 10 to 20 feet in diameter hovering silently about 10 feet above the water about 500 feet out from the shore. You could see it's reflection in the water below. It had multi colored lights evenly distributed around its surface. Similar to what a globe would look like if you put a light at each intersection of a lat and long. It was spinning, but not an any axis - more like a tumble in many different directions - the lights made it easy to see the tumbling effect. After hovering there for about a minute, it sped south down the coast toward Daytona and over the horizon. It was over the horizon and out of site within 10 seconds and moving at a high rate of speed. But it was completely silent.

HUGE Sphere-like craft spotted while driving S on Interstate I-95 near St. Augustine, FL (NOT A BLIMP!!);2008-01-28 10:45:00;1 minutes;HUGE Sphere-like craft spotted while driving S on Interstate I-95 near St. Augustine, FL (NOT A BLIMP!!) Driving South on I95 just South of St. Augustine in Florida...saw a sphere-like craft with smaller top, silvery-white in color, seems to of been silently floating on east side of I-95 first heading south than disappearing low behind tree line...few minutes later saw it again on east side of I95 South heading in opposite direction, North.  It headed North for approx 15 seconds, than disappeared again behind tree line.   Have never seen anything like this...must of been 10-15 times the size of a normal airplane in the air within at least a few miles of interstate.  It didn't look like any blimp I have ever seen..wasn't oval at all, but more sphere like with a smaller top.  I am embarrassed to say that it looked just like pictures of UFO's I've seen in the news latey.  I couldn't believe myself.  I am not the type to report this, but it was just to amazing not to.  I am a professional.  A ((deleted--thirties)) year old married mother.  I am a ((deleted--health care professional)) and my husband is a ((deleted--health care professional)) in Jacksonville.  I would most definitely not make this up. This was not a blimp..growing up in Florida, I have seen many, many blimps, rockets, space shuttles, etc...especially since my father was a ((deleted--aerospace worker)) and I lived in Cape Canaveral most of my childhood.  This thing was going very, very, very fast...much, much faster than any blimp could travel.  It was traveling so smoothly through the air with no sound.  It was soooo unusual.  I am unable to express how different it was than anything I have EVER seen.  It was going maybe much faster than a jet plane could, but it was almost like a glider.   Tried to take photos of if, but I was driving alone, and they didn't come out too well on my camera phone.   I tried to call FAA to find out about it..but couldn't get anyone to answer me.  It was stopping traffic...it was just like NOTHING I have ever seen in the world.  It was amazing and very, very big. I would love to know if anyone else reported something yesterday morning.  It was approx around 10:45am ET. Thank you.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
Large, metal, cylinder object over Saint Augustine Beach hovers and then disappears.;2009-04-16 17:00:00;1.5 minutes;Large, metal, cylinder object over Saint Augustine Beach hovers and then disappears. It was about 5pm this evening.  I was on my back porch with my dad and stepmother when I noticed a bright light in the sky.  It looked like the sun was reflecting off of a very large metal object.  My backyard faces north and the object was northwest of us.  It was much too high to be any sort of blimp and much too large to be a balloon.  It sat very still.  There were planes flying out of Jax International all around it.  They all had tail lines.  This didnâ€™t move, nor did it leave any type of trail.  It had no lights.  It just looked like a silver/white, huge object sitting in the sky.  We never took our eyes off of it.  Within about a minute or so, it just disappeared.  This was my second sighting for all of us.  My first was in St. Maarten at Simpson Bay and theirs was in Arkansas.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
Black sphere flying in weird directions went behind a tree, then seen a blimp shaped object jet off.;2011-06-05 14:18:00;3-4 minutes;Black sphere flying in weird directions went behind a tree, then seen a blimp shaped object jet off. 6/5/2011 Around 2:20 pm I was at work.  I work in front of 4 large department store sized windows.  I was watching the Casey Anthony trial On t.v. when something behind the t.v. outside the window caught my eye.  There's a few large trees in my view.   At first it looked like a bird flying in an air stream by the movements it was making.  So i went outside to get a better look.  Upon watching it I noticed it was a sphere shaped black object flying in crazy directions then it went behind a tree.  I went inside to get my co worker when I came back outside I seen a small blimp shaped object to the right of the original object.   It zoomed off so fast.  Ive never ever seen anything fly or move that fast. EVER!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  One of three reports from same anonymous source possible hoax??  PD));29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
4 strange orbs of light going around in a weird formation above an abnormally shaped cloud.;2013-11-28 21:50:00;15-20 minutes;4 strange orbs of light going around in a weird formation above an abnormally shaped cloud. We we're walking outside and we look up to the sky and noticed 4 orbs of light going around in a weird formation.  It kept repeating the same formation over and over again.   We proceeded to walk home and we continued to notice it going in the same pattern.  The strangest thing is it followed us all the way back to our house.   There was also a weird shaped cloud that they would stay inside the perimeter of and wouldn't leave.  It seemed to me that this weird shaped cloud was the mother ship and the orbs of light going in the weird formation were smaller space crafts.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
