2004 cigar shapped object hovering in sky over neighbors house;2004-09-24 17:30:00;1 minute;2004 cigar shapped object hovering in sky over neighbors house The evening of September 24 or 25th around 5:30pm, my husband and I were leaving the house to go out to eat dinner.  I heard a bird chirp and looked up to the tree where I thought it was coming from, to see what kind of bird it was.  I saw a large oject hovering in the sky over the neighbors house.  I called to my husband to look at it.  He did not know what it was.  It was a metalic gray color with no windows, no lights, no sound, no wires.  There was, what looked like a small vent on the side of the object.  By the time we moved to a different position to get a better veiw of it, it was gone.  It was in length, about as long as a football field.  We had not seen anything like this before or since that evening. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
