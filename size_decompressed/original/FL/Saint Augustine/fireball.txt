Sparking fireball in sky heading north to south;2006-10-25 20:54:00;2 minutes;Sparking fireball in sky heading north to south Driving home from work late 8:54pm EST. Passed through the community guard gate and saw a fireball with trailing sparks about the size of an out-stretched arm's thumb.  Saw it only for a second through the trees as I drove.   Once I cleared the trees and got a better look it was farther away and not sparking as much.  I drove around the corner to get a better look (should have gone forward 1/2 mile to the only hill in the community but wasn't thinking) but it was elusive due to the tall slash pines around me.  As I drove nearer my house and hopefully to a clearer spot. there was another car stopped watching it too.  I asked them what they saw and they said the same thing big fire ball like a plane was on fire.  They followed it and might have seen more because they were in a better spot.  As we watched it move slowly away from us (south -southeast) it began to vary in brightness with the sparks starting and stopping.  I heard no noise.  Looked like the object was traveling about the speed of an aircraft but I didn't see any flashing lights on it other than the sparks.  Really looked like a plane on fire but there was no sound.  Other planes were in the air but farther way.  I live near a small airport, its probably a faulty engine but very few jet engine craft fly from the airport and not many at all at this time of night.   I called the police they are coming over to make a report.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
A fire ball shot across the sky and disapeard in thin air,;2008-04-19 21:17:00;3-5 min.;A fire ball shot across the sky and disapeard in thin air, I was at the fair on a ride when i saw probly 5 or 6 people pointing up into the sky. I looked up and saw a bright solid white light with a short tail. I got off the ride and watched it fly across the sky at a constant speed and altitude seemingly too fast for a plane and too slow for a shooting star. I pointed it out to my friends and we watched along with others as it flew across the sky behind the trees. We moved to a clearing to watch it more but moments after watching it, it disapeard even though it was compleatly out in the open.

ON MY WAY HOME I SAW A GLOWING SPHERE WITH A FIREY TRAIL, MUCH LIKE A COMET, EXCEPT THAT IT DIDN'T APPEAR TO MOVE.;2009-03-06 23:00:00;30 SEC;ON MY WAY HOME I SAW A GLOWING SPHERE WITH A FIREY TRAIL, MUCH LIKE A COMET, EXCEPT THAT IT DIDN'T APPEAR TO MOVE. WHILE DRIVING ON THE 206 BRIDGE IN ST. AUGUSTINE,FLORIDA, I LOOKED LEFT (SOUTH) AND SAW A GLOWING WHITE LIGHT WITH TRAILING FIRE.   AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT LOOKED LIKE A COMET, BUT IT REMAINED STATIONARY WITH STREAKS OF FLAMES, SO TO SPEAK, COMING OUT OF THE LOWER RIGHT SIDE OF THE GLOWING OBJECT.    IN AN INSTANT THE FLAMES STOPPED, IT REMAINED GLOWING FOR AN INSTANT, THEN LOST IT'S GLOW AND LOOKED LIKE ANY SMALL AIRCRAFT, AS IT'S LIGHT LOOKED NORMAL, EXCEPT THAT I DIDN'T SEE AND STROBE LIGHTS OF ANY KIND LIKE YOU WOULD SEE IN A REGULAR AIRCRAFT.  IT APPEARED TO TURN TO THE SOUTH FROM WHAT SEEMED LIKE AN EASTERLY HEADING, THEN TREES OBSTRUCTED MY VIEW AND I NEVER SAW IT AGAIN.   THERE IS A BRIDGE OPERATOR IN A SMALL TOWER 24 HOURS A DAY ON THAT BRIDGE.  I WONDER IF HE EVER SEES SUCH THINGS?;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
Red fireball? flys across St. Augustine sky!;2012-07-12 22:40:00;3 minutes;Red fireball? flys across St. Augustine sky! I stepped outside and was star-gazing and noticed several private and commercial aircraft that were flying by at their normal altitude.  My garage that I was standing outside of faces due south and I was scanning the stars in the western sky and noticed one that was moving.  From a far it didn't seem to be moving very fast, but as it approached its speed became faster and faster until at approximately 45 degrees from my view point, I was finally able to make out a true color which was red and its elevation seemed to be extreme upper atmosphere. Moving from the west to the east from my 45 degree point of view on the west to my 45 degree p.o.v. on the east at what seemed to be the upper atmosphere it cleared that range within approximately 35-40 seconds.  I continued to watch it until I was no longer able to see it in the east. According to the NOAA the wind at that time was blowing ESE at 5 knots.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851

Stunning orange fireball in the sky..;2013-08-07 08:30:00;8 minutes;Stunning orange fireball in the sky.. My husband and I were talking a ride on some back roads when we came to a clearing and saw a bright firey orange light in the sky, so we pulled off to the side of the road and stood there and watched this orange glowing ball move across the sky towards the beach then dissapeared behind some trees.  So we walked forward to gain sight when it reappeared it was at least 6 miles from the 3 seconds we lost the visual.  When It reappeared it then had one large glowing orange ball with 3 smaller lights around it perfect distances from each other.   Watched it for about 4 mins untill it disappeared.

Strange rocket-like fireball from the north headed south without a sound.;2021-01-23 20:33:00;2;Strange rocket-like fireball from the north headed south without a sound. We witnessed a bright fireball through the clouds. It moved about the speed of a jet at high altitude and resembled what a rocket launch looks like, except it was going from NNE to SSW instead of from the south where we see rockets. It never got smaller and fainter like a rocket leaving the atmosphere, but maintained brightness and speed as it left our eyesight without a sound.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
