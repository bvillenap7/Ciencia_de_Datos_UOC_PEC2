3 orange fireballs over the ocean in st. augustine beach;2008-05-17 23:00:00;3 sec.;3 orange fireballs over the ocean in st. augustine beach While walking along the beach, My companion and myself saw what we think were 3 orange balls that looked like they were on fire. One second they were there, then nothing. We asked ourselves what we thought it was because it was over the water at some distance, yet very obvious. Today I spoke to a friend who said that there have been reports of possible ufo's in the past month, but we both laughed. I looked it up on my computer just now and read that what I saw was also reported 2 weeks ago. maybe there is somthing to it so I am writing you today. I am curious if anyone else saw anything as well last night. Who should I contact without sounding like I am crazy?;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851

The typical meteor streaks brightly and burns out.  Tonight I witnessed a dim dot high overhead, traveling at a high rate of speed.  It was dim, equivalent to the dimmest star but disappeared to quickly to be a satellite or other object in orbit.  I have seen a thousand meteor's in my 39 years and this one looked nothing like any other.  It was directly overhead my location traveling South to North.  I am reporting this in case anyone else on my longitude reports a similar sighting.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
