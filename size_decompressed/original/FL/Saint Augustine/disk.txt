Help requested identifying object over wall of fort in Florida;2003-06-21 13:00:00;?;Help requested identifying object over wall of fort in Florida My family and I were in St. Augustine, FL for the day.  We were at the fort, Castillo de san Marcos, where we have visited many times before.  We didn't see or hear anything unusual that day and none of us remember a plane, helicopter or anything else flying overhead (even though none of these things even vaguely resemble what we caught in the picture).  We just had the film developed and I also requested a picture CD.  As I was looking through the pictures one of them shows a distinctly silver, disk-shaped object over the fort.  I have no idea what this is and it was suggested to me find somewhere to send the picture in hopes of finding out just what we captured in this picture.  Can you help?  Again, nothing was noticed that day, just once we got the pictures back developed.  The picture was shot with a 35mm camera. ((NUFORC Note:  We will request that the witness forward a copy of the photo to NUFORC for our perusal.  We receive many such photos and requests, and only very few of the photos, do we think, are of bona fide UFO's.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851

A disc-shaped object, lit from underneath, drifted/hovered into our area near the Crescent Beach Bridge in St Augustine, FL.;2014-11-27 18:00:00;2 minutes;A disc shaped object, lit from underneath, drifted/hovered into our area near the Crescent Beach Bridge in St. Augustine, FL.   My wife and I observed the disc and pulled off the road, rolled down our windows, and heard no noise from the disc.   We immediately discussed what we were seeing and ruled out a helicopter or airplane due to speed of craft, shape, and no noise.   The object turned south and moved approximately south over Highway A1A.  I followed the disc and pulled off the road again to listen for noise and heard none.  I then observed the disc shoot straight up into the sky for approximately fifteen seconds until I could not observe it anymore.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
Two separate blue, red, and green flashing orbs over southwest St Johns County.;2016-07-16 02:00:00;30 minutes;Two separate blue, red, and green flashing orbs over southwest St Johns County I live in southern st johns county and went outside at approx 1:45 to retrieve something from my car when I noticed a reddish colored orb to the southwest just above the tree line which I first thought was a bright planet.   After watching it for a while it seemed to have flashing lights and be moving very slowly so I monitored it to see if it was a plane or some kind of aircraft.  I grabbed my binoculars out of my car so I could see more clearly.  It looked like some kind of flying craft with multi-colored lights flashing in blue, red, and green.   I went in and got my husband so he could tell me I was crazy and he came out and looked at it.  He said he had no idea what out was, but out was pretty strange looking.  It wasn't a plane because it was moving too slowly and appeared to be hovering and then moving at a slow speed.  We were about to come back in the  house and looked out to the west and saw a second one that looked exactly the same as the other, just above! the tree line.  They looked to be about 5 miles away (I live about 2 miles from the ocean).  Anyway, we came in at 2:20 after we lost sight of the first one behind the trees.  Strange, never saw anything like that.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
Alien saucer sighted in St. Augustine, Florida.  ((anonymous report));2016-10-01 00:00:00;1 minute;Alien saucer sighted in St. Augustine, Florida My two friends and I decided to watch the sky at a popular tourist attraction called the fort in St. Augustine, Florida.  I used to live there, they still do.   It was a full moon, we were dancing and talking.  All the sudden I see a saucer flying way lower to the ground than a plane would be flying.  It was also hovering.  Planes DO NOT hover.  Helicopters do, but it was NOT a helicopter.   It was clearly saucer shaped.  It was lighted up, I can't recall what colors.  It was moving in strange ways, back ans forth, side to side.  I was so shocked.  I pointed at it to show my friends and said  HOLY $&@&/& IS THAT AN ALIEN SHIP?!  And they both said something that was somewhere along the lines of YEAH!!!   The saucer ZOOMED so fast.  Fast as lightning away into an abyss.  We don't know where it went, it kind of just dissapeared like a ghost.  And that was that.   We started running away from where we were, back to town, where we felt safe.
