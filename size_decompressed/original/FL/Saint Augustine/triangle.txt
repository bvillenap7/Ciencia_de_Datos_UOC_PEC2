I saw a spaceship take off from slow speed to around the speed of light in second from only 30 feet away.;1993-08-15 04:00:00;30 minutes;I saw a spaceship take off from slow speed to around the speed of light in second from only 30 feet away. This is a report of an earlier sighting the exact date I am unsure of due to the tramatic effect it had.I was presently working as a security guard at a condominium on St. Augustine Beach Florida.It was an eerie night and I was standing in the parking lot beginning to get bored so my mind started to wander. I was looking out through space because the night was crystal clear even though there was a lot of heat lightning over the sea.I was listening to my car radio and lying on the hood of my car when I noticed one of the stars ( I was attempting a trial of astral projection)had suddenly left its place in the sky and moved to another location.This upset me a little because I am inteligent and believe that it is perfectly possible for something to travel through space to another planet.So I left my post for a little while and drove a couple of blocks to an all night convenient store for a pack of cigarettes.I was much calmer at this point and was beginning to forget the whole thing when I noticed a sensation of being completely alone as I was driving back to the parking lot.It seemed like I could here the crickets humming from miles away and the sound of my own heartbeat was clearly audible.I parked the car got out and started my patrol around the condo.I was just starting to round the corner when I notised a little fog was visible and I could see the parking lot lights.Suddenly I noticed from my left someting approching at a very slow speed through the light fog.I remember thinking I hope this is a flock of pelicans but unfortunately it was not. I saw a ship at an altitude of about 20 ' traveling less than 30 mph moving across the parking lot.I noticed the design had to be alien because of its overall shape being unlike anything of the earth my experience coming from being in the army and my father who worked for Grumman corp.The cockpit was like anondized metal black and opaque like some kind of energy absorbing substance.I believe the color of the ship was subdued green. The wings were delta shaped and! bent do wnword  away from the fuselage.It was almost past when I noticed engines and ports situated in back and tucked under the wings.Just the a tremendouse muffled blast came out of the engines and I could follow its tightly twisted vapor trail till the object was completely out of site way way out into space in about 10 seconds.THere is much more too be told about ie. its physical effects on myself but I have run out of time for now.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
Three lights, silent craft, leaving a green Haze  in the sky;1998-08-30 04:00:00;5-7 minutes;Three lights, silent craft, leaving a green Haze  in the sky My friend and I were driving down a dark road at 4am, cruising around.  We saw 3 lights in the sky. Slowly, 3 ligts comming towards us in the sky. We slowed down, amazed. There was no sound.    We stopped the car because the lights lit up the inside of our car!  We got out to look.  It was right above the palm trees.  We saw no shape of the craft, it was really dark that night,  with no moon.    It was completely silent and still. I looked around, and the lights had lit up the street like a baseball field in the area around us.  It then went vertical, and went back into the blackness of the sky.  There was a green haze left as it dissapeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
Silent running triangular craft, 7 very dim orange lights outlining the part of the craft I could see .;2005-03-06 23:57:00;aprox 8 seconds;Silent running triangular craft, 7 very dim orange lights outlining the part of the craft I could see . At 23:58 hrs, Saturday night, March 06, 2005, I stepped out of the guard house at a local marina where I am a security officer. I was looking ESE, up aprox. 45 degrees above the horizontal.   A movement of light caught my eye.  There were four dim orange lights in a straight line moving at aprox. 175 kts. in a NNW direction. As the craft passed at aprox. 1200 feet away and at about the same altitude, I noticed three more dim orange lights across the after end of the craft.  The craft was definitely triangular in shape as outlined by the lights on the craft.   There was NO SOUND from the craft what so ever.  There was 4 orange lights from front to back and 3 lights across the rear end, the underbody was grey as iluminated from the reflection from the bridge lights reflecting off the intercoastal waterway.  That is how I was able to determine the distance and height of the craft, and as well the direction and aprox. speed. There were NO STROBE LIGHTS either.  The temp. was 48 deg. wind 8 kts. out of the NNW and light overcast at about 1500 ft. Duration of the observation was about eight seconds.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851

I had steped out back for a cigarett in our break area. I was the only one outside, at the time. I looked up in the sky due to the 3 bright lights catching my eye.The 3 light's were in a triangle shape, at least, 3 football field's  in length.What ever it was it was moving very slow at a low altitude. What really freaked me out, is that there was a hugh disipation of vapor coming out from the thing. However this lasted only a few second's. This was not an airplane or any type of helecoptor.I believe the ship was cloaked as i could not see the actual ship. I believe cloaking is possible, starting with Project Rainbow, back in 1941.The next thing i noticed was a strange round multicolor light in front of the craft.The light expanded as fireworks explod and the craft was gone.People think i am crazy, however i know what i saw.

While on vacation, at 04:40 early in the morning I observed a triangular lighted object tracking north to south stopping several times;2007-08-12 04:40:00;2-3 minutes;While on vacation, at 04:40 early in the morning I observed a triangular lighted object tracking north to south stopping several times suspended still.  The size is what got my attention, as it became closer I was able to identify that it indeed was one object and not several lights together.  It was completely silent, gliding if you will to the south just over the Atlantic Ocean.  I would estimate its size of being 200'x200'x200.  From a stopped position, to moving, there wasn't any noise nor lateral movement upon acceleration.  Object left from sight on south-easterly direction.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851

2 triangle shaped crafts with 5 lights seen with night vision goggles zooming north over the coast of Florida.;2012-01-28 23:00:00;3 seconds;2 triangle shaped crafts with 5 lights seen with night vision goggles zooming north over the coast of Florida. Four friends and I were using ambient light night vision goggles on the beach of Anastasia park in St. Augustine, FL on Saturday January 28th at 11:00 pm.  I was gazing into the stars when something moving extremely fast, crossed my vision. I wouldn’t have thought much of it however, the objects were only visible though my night vision goggles and appeared closer than any of the other stars I was observing. The next thing I noticed was the shape that these lights where arranged. The 1st object had 5 lights arranged in the shape of an elongated triangle.  This object flew at approximately 80 deg angle over our heads so I was able to get a direct view of the bottom.  The other object was in the same shape but flying at a further angle. It had to be flying at about 45 deg over our heads, which skewed the shape into a staggered linear arrangement of the same lights.  They were in my line of vision for approximately 3 seconds before they disappear from view. They were flying in the north bound direction and came from the south .I had just enough time to pass the goggles to a friend who caught the tail end of their flight and agreed it was not like any of the other stars in the sky. Both objects were in front of the other stars because the shape around the lights blocked out the other stars it was flying in front of. Meaning the outline the 5 lights made on the 1st object was a dense shape and the lights were not flying separately, they were apart of a whole shape.   Five minutes after spotting these objects and getting the other four friends to point their goggles to the sky another single light (the same size/type of the lights on the other two objects) followed in the same direction and speed as the previous sighting.  It couldn’t have been a satellite because they revolve around our equator with a flight path more like east to west.   ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites, almost invariably, either are in a polar orbit, or they have an easterly component to their ground track.  PD));29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
Trail of strange orange lights moving over St Augustine.;2013-01-16 09:50:00;10-15 minutes;Trail of strange orange lights moving over St Augustine. Tonight around 9:50pm I was walking in downtown St Augustine near Flagler College and saw an orange light traveling south to north at what appeared to be a low altitude.  As I continued walking I saw that there were a string of these lights spaced out at even intervals.  I saw as many as five spaced out to the horizon at a time.  When they passed directly overhead I could make out a round-cornered triangle shape.  I was able to follow one across its path north and while i was watching it I saw another one pass by it at a different angle and direction...different from the others, then passed out of sight.  I continued watching until the last light disappeared around 10pm. In total I saw what I believe to be 8-12 of these lights.  It was not an airplane! I could see airplanes in the sky I know their lights from growing up next to an airbase.  I took a short video with my iPhone but you cant see much.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851

Huge flying triangle.;2017-03-15 21:00:00;1 minute;huge flying triangle so last night I was at work (3rd shift) and was outside in an area where there was no lighting.  the sky was cloudless and dark as the moon was still on the east horizon and had not risen yet.  I looked up and saw a V formation of lights. there were probably around 10 to 15 lights on each side of the V.  the lights were all white and were not that bright from my vantage point.  I looked to see the body of the craft but could not make anything out as it was so dark.  however as it flew overhead it blanked out the stars so it appeared to be one solid object.  it looked to be about in the 5-6,000 ft high range and was very BIG. this thing was massive and traveling at a pretty good pace.  there was zero noise.  being that it was early in the evening and clear and flying over major metro areas of palm coast, flagler, and st. Augustine, surely someone else saw this thing.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
Same huge triangle seen again 5 days later.;2017-03-20 22:10:00;20 seconds;same huge triangle seen again 5 days later I submitted a sighting for St. Augustine for 3/15/17 regarding a huge triangle shaped UFO.  I was outside last night again around 10:10 with another person and the exact same object flew over again, roughly 10 lights to a side on the V.  flying south to north parallel to U.S. 1.  this was in St. Augustine south.  could not make out the body of the thing but again the stars blanked out as it passed leading one to believe it was one solid object.  this was also seen by someone with me who is probably the biggest skeptic on the planet.  he was startled by it and did not have an explanation for this.  he believes now. as far as size is concerned, a best guess by both of us is several hundred feet.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
