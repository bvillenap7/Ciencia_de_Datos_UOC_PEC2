UFO sighting in Northeast Florida;2008-04-19 15:45:00;1-2 minutes;UFO sighting in Northeast Florida Stopped at red light at 312 and A1A intersection, in the eastern sky there was one large craft that was similar to a blimp in appearance, with a thick black stripe through the center of the craft. Under the large craft there was a small craft below it to the left, which appeared to be silver/metallic in structure and also a circular/disclike shape.  They were stationary, I didnâ€™t see them move the entire duration at the red light which was over a minute and a half.   I noticed and snapped pictures with my camera phone that did not come out. I decided to drive closer to the crafts to try and take more pictures and they disappeared.  Previous to this sighting the observer has had a number of dreams with extraterrestrials in them.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851

big plus sign object slowly moving then disappeared. Reflecting light on the edges and see through/black. not bright;2020-11-23 22:00:00;5 seconds;big plus sign object slowly moving then disappeared. Reflecting light on the edges and see through/black. not bright It was a clear night at 10pm in St. Augustine, Florida. I was laying on the ground in my backyard looking at the stars when I saw a large boxed plus sign appear in the sky directly above me and begin moving very slowly until it disappeared about 5 seconds later. 	The object was about 8 times the size of a full moon. It looked metallically reflective but it was also see through because I could see the black night sky through it. Either that or the object was black, making it seem like I was looking through it to the night sky. Because it was either see through or black, the only reason I was able to see it was because the edges looked like they were reflecting light, possibly from the half moon which was nearby, on its right. It was not bright - the only reason it caught my attention was because it was huge and it was moving. Since it had no color and only reflective properties, it looked more like a distortion of the night sky rather than an object. The two rectangles that made up the plus sign shape were not the same size one was longer, so more like a cross but the intersection was in the middle unlike the traditional Christian cross. It was perfectly symmetrical and made up of right angles. It looked very far up in the atmosphere which is what bothers me the most because something that was high in the atmosphere looking as large as it did would have to be absolutely enormous.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
