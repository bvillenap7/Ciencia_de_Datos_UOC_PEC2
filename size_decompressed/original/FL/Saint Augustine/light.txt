White light flies into brighter white light and both go straight up.;1973-03-01 20:00:00;60 seconds;White light flies into brighter white light and both go straight up. In the early evening, just after dark. A friend and I were sitting in the cockpit of my sailboat at a marina in St Augustine, Fl., just having a general conversation. We were sitting across from each other facing East. My friend stated Did you see what I just saw.  I said what exactly did you see. We compared stories.  What we saw was a very bright star high in the ESE sky. (Out over the Atlantic Ocean}. It was a white light similiar to the brighness of the planet Venus and was just sitting there.  Suddenly we noticed a smaller white light coming from the 4 o'clock position and it was very fast it went straight into the brighter light. After maybe a few seconds the brighter light {with the smaller light} went straight up and out of sight. We are both convinced to this day that this was a UFO as it did something we didn't think regular aircraft could do. It was a first sighting for both of us. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Three bright lights seen flying at a slow speed across sky.  Witnessed by hundreds.;2008-04-19 20:50:00;5 minutes;Three bright lights seen flying at a slow speed across sky.  Witnessed by hundreds. We were at the county fair along with a few hundred people when two bright lights flew directly over downtown St Augustine.  The back light sped up to catch the front light and both continued to move across the sky at a slow speed.  They eventually both faded out, and then a third flew directly over us at the same speed and in the same direction. All three were the same brightness and color.  They did not blink like a regular plane. It was definitely not an airplane.  Hopefully others will write what they witnessed!;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
Orange light over the ocean;2009-04-04 20:00:00;5 minutes;Orange light over the ocean Sometimes I like to go to the beach as the sun goes down and walk as far as I can until I'm isolated and just enjoy the environment. Last night as I was heading back, I saw an intense orange light in the sky which looked similar to a firework which is about to explode into multiple little specks of light. That is what I actually thought it was, but when it did not become a bunch of smaller lights like a firework,I decided that it must be the light of a helicopter because it moved slowly like one. It began to head towards the beach as I expected to see/hear a helicopter but didn't.  The light then dimmed as it moved paralell to the beach and looked a little bit like it could be an airplane and yet thinned out and resembled a comet, then small enough to be a star. It changed directions after about 3-5 minutes, then it suddenly disappeared.  About 5 seconds later, it came back, reversed direction and immediately disappeared again.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
Glowing white orb floating across sky then stopped. Faded out, then re-lit.;2011-06-02 21:00:00;2-5 minutes;Glowing white orb floating across sky then stopped.  Faded out, then re-lit 6/2/2011 I was floating in the pool at my apartment.  It was a little after 9 pm I seen a bright white glowing object fly by then stop and fade out above me.  You could still see it but it was a little white dot.  It then re-lit and glowed white again still at a stop not moving.  Some other people in the pool were yelling out loud what the hell is that   We were all looking at the same thing in the sky.  It zoomed off so fast you could have blinked and missed it.  Now a few minutes later it came back it was the non glowing white dot cruising through the sky, then it lit up super bright and zipped away in the opposite direction.

I did turn around and backtrack where i seen it but it was gone.   Now the creepy part of this sighting was my co worker called me minutes later to tell me that her daughter who lives 30 miles north of my sighting just seen a bright glowing orb fly my direction about 2 minutes prior to my sighting.

Glowing white lite shoots across sky and makes sudden U turns and spirals.;2012-01-24 23:45:00;3-4 Seconds;Glowing white lite shoots across sky and makes sudden U turns and spirals. Went for a walk around my neighborhood before bed. Very white and glowing like, with a color similar to a white LED.  First I saw what I thought was a shooting star fly behind a tree as I just caught a glimpse.  From the same direction a few seconds latter another one came across the sky which I first expected to be a shooting star.  It shot across the sky and then made a hair-pin 90 degree turn followed by an L turn heading away from me with a little bit of a spiral and faded out. It made very fast and sporadic movements with an incredible speed and sudden changes of direction. It moved kind of like and insect but it was very brite and kind of made me think of a firefly. Really unlike anything I have seen and did not seam at all like an aircraft of any kind. I also could not tell how close it was or its relative size and distance. It was no closer than 350 feet but may have been much further.  It was also strange that when I first saw what I thought was a shooting star I was looking for what I thought was a second shooting star as if I expected it before it appeared again in its spectacular yet surrealism.  It also was not defined like a shooting star but more glowing like but unmistakable and bright it is appearance but very soft on the eyes.  It also looked like a mix between an electrical spark, a shooting star and an orb or what I would best describe as glowing white light.  I always thought a UFO would be more clearly defined as a light that looked like a large star with more linear movements.  This was more difficult to define or to relatively grasp.  Its movements were also graceful yet complex. I have no idea how to explain.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
Bright large yellow white ball appeared mid sky at sunset and fell toward horizon in St. Augustine, Florida.;2015-12-10 18:10:00;10 seconds;Bright large yellow white ball appeared mid sky at sunset and fell toward horizon in St. Augustine, Florida. Driving on beach A1A in St. Augustine, Florida, going west - approaching main A1A.  The sun had set and it was already getting dark.   From about halfway up in the Southwest sky a very bright light appeared and proceeded to fall rather arched toward direct west (if I was facing 12 o'clock this appeared in the 11 o'clock position and fell downward toward the 12 o'clock position).   I thought it was a shooting star but it remained just as bright as it fell, no tail, no fireball appearance - just a very large and very bright yellowish white color - moving very fast.  Lost sight of it at the tree line but did not see an explosion or any indication it hit the ground.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851

I called my husband and my son to see it and it was a white dense light circling 360 degrees miles above the clouds going faster than a plane with no sound and it flew in a circular formation and we stopped counting the time it circled over the sky after 500 times until it disappeared at around 7:12 PM.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
Light brighter than most stars flew overhead in a SE dir..  Light began to shrink in the SE sky and turned to a red dot.

It appeared to be climbing in height during the passing overhead.  Def just one light and seemed far away as a large plane but a totally bizarre flight route and was not blinking like a plane would be.  Probably moved 5 times the speed in comparison to average aircraft at max altitude. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

They were whitish, yellow lights, very bright and blinking slowly.  They would get really bright and then dim out.  They appeared one at a time and began multiplying.  One became 5 or six. They lit up and then began separating and then all disappeared.  I grabbed my phone and began recording the sky.  They reappeared right over top of us about 1 minute later as I recorded them.  Same behavior one lit up then another then they all disappeared again.  The videos that I recorded are saved to my phone and when I try to watch them they are blank.  I have no clue why these videos will not playback.  Both were about 1 minute in length and it’s showing saved videos but they say 0:00 and won’t playback.  Definitely never seen anything like what we just saw ever before.. we heard no noise associated with these lights and the sky is pretty clear.  I could see the stars out in the sky but whatever made these lights couldn’t be seen.  Wild!;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851

A bright white light flashed across the sky and immediately after a glowing green light began hovering directly under the flash.  The green light then proceeded to float across the sky and vanished into the distance.  The light was moving at a moderate speed and was visible for 6-7 seconds.

20 plus lights in single file. About 5 minutes viewing. Last 2 lights were side by side. ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-30 21:10:00;5 minutes;20 plus lights in single file. About 5 minutes viewing. Last 2 lights were side by side. I was walking my dog at night.  Moon was out. As i was walking back to the house i noticed how beautiful the night sky was.  I decided to look up on my phone what planets were visible.  I look up again and i noticed movement.  Then more.  There was about 20 lights spaced apart moving across the sky in a row.  I called my son at 9:14 pm and he made it outside just in time to see about 6 of these lights.  No blinking and the last 2 lights appeared to be side by side as a rear guard kind of formation.  Was a very exciting visual experience.  Not sure if it was musks satellites .  The last 2 lights side by side makes me think not satellites. .;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
