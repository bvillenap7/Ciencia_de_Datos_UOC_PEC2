Brief Blue-Green egg thing (Low flying);2006-10-20 07:45:00;Blink of an eye;Brief Blue-Green egg thing (Low flying) I saw a low flying object fly over a bridge across the marsh on my way to school. It was overcast and the sun was slightly behind us.  It was a blue-green egg shape, with a slight green haze around it. It had what apperared to be a tail and it was only there for a second,heading toward the ground but disappeared before impact.. Me and my mom saw it and belived it to be a shooting star but two things were wrong. 1: It was broad daylight 2: It was too close, and the wrong shape.  Hope that this helps.
