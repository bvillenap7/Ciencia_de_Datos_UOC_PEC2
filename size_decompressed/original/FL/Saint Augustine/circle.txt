The object was round with a look similar to a jellyfish without the tenticales.  It did not have lights or color.  It was gray, or smoke color.  It did change position, but not shape.  It was higher in the second photograph. I have emailed the photographs to the email address provided.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
Large bright circular object viewed over the ocean's horizon at St. Augustine Pier;2009-03-16 14:45:00;15 Minutes;Large bright circular object viewed over the ocean's horizon at St. Augustine Pier I was surfing at the St. Augustine pier and spotted a bright yellow, perfectly circular object hovering in the Northeast area of the sky right above the waterline. In the middle of the object was a smaller dark circle, almost like a small hole. I watched the object move from the northeast towards the north very slowly, in a slight up and down pattern. The object slowly rotated as it was traveling across the sky, changing from a perfect circle to a thin line, as if I were looking at the object from it's side. The object also slowly changed color from bright yellow to orange, to a darker shade of orange, and then back to bright yellow. It continued to rotate from a full circular shape to a line then back again. The object completely disappeared and reappared twice as I watched it travel slowly across the horizon line above the water. I paddled up to two other surfers in the water, pointed out the object to them and asked if they had been watching it. One said he had been watching it and didn't know what the hell that thing is. The other surfer said it could possibly be a kiteboarder, but there is no way a kite could make a perfectly circular shape like what we were seeing, or be that far out to sea. All three of us ruled out certain slow moving objects like a blimp, or even the moon. The moon could not have traveled that far along the coast in 15 minutes, nor change color, nor disappear as it did. I called the St. Augustine Beach Police Department when I got home. They said no one else had called with such a report today, and was hung up on in mid-sentence while I was trying to honestly describe what I had seen.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
Flying balloon of fire traveling east to west and suddenly turned due south and disappeared.;2010-07-04 10:00:00;~ 3 mins;Flying balloon of fire traveling east to west and suddenly turned due south and disappeared. At first we thought it resembled a helicopter, because we are near NAS Jacksonville and the helicopters fly but we quickly realized we were wrong.  We described it at the time as resembling a balloon on fire.  It was probably several miles away. It was in the eastern sky and was moving toward the west quickly.  As it got closer it really looked as if there was a large flame.  We continued watching it quickly took a 90 degree turn to the south and disappeared.  I spoke with another neighbor on August 7, 2010 and brought up what we saw.  She said she saw it too and didn't mention it because she thought it was a UFO and felt uncomfortable talking about it.  That changed immediately when we brought up what we saw.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
Saw a distant light in the east begin to move north, 10 minutes later a similiar object in the west is heading south;2010-09-07 21:23:00;3-7 minutes;Saw a distant light in the east begin to move north, 10 minutes later a similiar object in the west is heading south It was around 9:23 on Tuesday September 7th 2010 in Saint Augustine, Florida.  I was observing the stars when I saw a plane typically fly by in the eastern skies, I recognize the planes immediately because they all have blinking lights and are quite noticeable next to the steady light of the stars. A few moments after the plane passed a small cluster of stars, I noticed one constant and unblinking light that broke away from the group and begin to head directly north.  The light was orange and had the appearance of a star, though it was clearly moving faster than the airplane.  I watched the light continue heading north for about 3 minutes, stepping backwards to see over the trees nearby. About 10 minutes later as I was observing the western skies, I noticed another plane heading south when I see the same orange/star like object heading south as well, it appeared to be closer this time and moved at least twice as fast as the plane it passed.  This was a short sighting due to the number of tall trees in the area, however it was of similar quality to the initial sighting.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851

Low, orange, bright, fast, quiet, ambient, ufo.;2013-01-29 21:00:00;5 minutes;Low, orange, bright, fast, quiet, ambient, ufo. One very bright orange light that moved through space like there were no laws of gravity.  It appeared to be a shooting star with no tail, and flew about half as low as plane generally do but could glide up and down like paper in breeze.   I followed it to the water front where as my view was obscured for ten seconds as I ran by trees and the craft was gone. it's bright light will stay in my memory like it knew I could see.   Minutes after I hear the sound of a plane flying by with no plane close enough to be making that noise. while it was directly above me I heard no noise, saw no machinery (wings, flashing lights, no object itself.)  Only the light.   It had to be traveling at four or fives times the speed of any other plane I saw in the sky.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851

My son's girlfriend was coming back from picking up supper.  When she came in the door she was excited and said look at the orange balls in the sky.  When she saw them they looked like the line of ufo's like the pictures in California we found.   When we went outside you can see something like flares coming over the tree line.  But they were not flares.  They were all in a single formation and then just went they came over the tree line they turned east and shot off.   I think I took the one pix right before it hit hyper space and perhaps the glow of the red went dull just before it took off.  You can see the markings on the craft.  WE took several pictures of them.  I mean the entire neighborhood was outside.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851

Self-illuminated or ground reflection off object?;2014-11-22 01:00:00;2 minutes;Self-illuminated or ground reflection off object? On November 22, 2014, at approximately 1a.m., I noticed a round object in the sky at about the distance of 3 to 5,000 ft.  I could not tell if it was self illuminated or being reflected from ground lights as it was dimly lit.  It looked like a soft glow orange or soft white light. This object traveled west to east in a straight line and traveled about a mile from the time I saw it.  Estimated speed was 200 mph.  It reached a certain point and made a perfect 90 degree turn without slowing and proceeded south for about a quarter mile, when it accelerated to an incredible speed, perhaps a thousand mph or more, instantaneously.   It went past the tree line where my view was obscured.;29.9118102649007;-81.4048639072851
