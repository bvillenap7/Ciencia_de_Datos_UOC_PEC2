Large gray cylinder hovering just above tree tops;2004-09-04 05:30:00;6 seconds;Large gray cylinder hovering just above tree tops My wife and I were just exiting the house and walked onto the front porch.  My wife heard a bird and looked up to see what kind it was and she observed a very large gray cylinder hovering over our home. I was also on the porch and looked up and I saw a very big gray cylinder hovering just above the trees.  There wasn't any sound to this object.  I walked into the yard and tried to position myself to observe more of the craft, but it was gone. The best way to discribe what I had seen was as if you were looking exactly at the side of a blimp from two feet away.  There were no windows, no sound and no movement noticable. I am a retired 30yr law enforcement officer and thought that I had seen everything, but this was unexplainable. We told a few friends about the experience but never reported it until now.  We just have to get this documented in case there are others out there who saw the same thing.  No one reported seeing any UFO that day, which I felt sure that someone would because of the size and location of this thing.
