A silver metallic, teardrop-shaped object in the skies north of Shalimar near main gate of Eglin AFB;1995-05-25 15:00:00;30 seconds;A silver metallic, teardrop-shaped object in the skies north of Shalimar near main gate of Eglin AFB I was walking home from the school bus stop on the corner of 8th Street and 8th Avenue about a week before I was due to graduate high school and I just happened to glance up and notice a strange object in the sky just to the north / northwest.  It seemed odd to me somehow so I watched it but continued to walk.  I would describe it as a silver metallic, teardrop-shaped object.  It stood out very plainly against the backdrop of a dark storm cloud that was coming in from the northwest.  (I might not never have seen it, if not for that.)  Anyway, even though it seemed to be moving just a bit too fast to be an aircraft, I really didn't think too much of it right away.  I just assumed that's what it actually was because I live so close to the military base.  I continued to watch it for several seconds, when suddenly it just came to a full stop in mid air!  I was stunned!  Needless to say, I stopped walking and just stood there and watched it.  It then started to move very erratically, changing speeds and directions seemingly at random.  It would occasionally stop and then start moving again.  The way it “danced” and “wiggled”, it made me think of a drop of mercury.  I watched it for about 30 seconds at most before it finally stopped in mid air one final time and then shot up straight into the sky like a slingshot and vanished.  It should be noted that the main gate of Eglin Air Force Base is barely 2 miles north of the town I live in (Shalimar, Florida) and this object appeared to me to be in the skies just to the west of the base's main gate.
