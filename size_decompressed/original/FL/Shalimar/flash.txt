And after about 3 min. after the sighting, their was two c-130s cargo planes flying side by side apart from each other a few 100 feet away in like a formation and a chopper/halicoppter was flying in the middle. so i guess eglin air force base picked it up in radar, because the 2 c-130s cargo plane and chopper/ halicoppter kinda resonded pretty quick.;30.4494;-86.5701
