Object appeared from the East traveling West at a high rate of speed.  The oval object appeared to be a metallic color with orange colored cross beam in the center.   I would estimate the object would have been 10 to 20,000 AGL. The object was moving at a high rate of speed in a straight line covering the skyline in about 7 to 9 seconds. There is a military base located in this area and aircraft were in operation to the Southwest conducting flight patterns.  The object spotted had not visible light markings other than a light orange glow from the center of the oval. This sighting took place at night, but with the orange glow from the bottom of the object appeared to illuminate the exterior of the object.  There was no sound associated with this object.;30.4494;-86.5701
