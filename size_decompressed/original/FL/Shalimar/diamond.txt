Around 21:21 hours me,my girlfriend,her son and my daughter walked out of our house and noticed a upside down diamond shaped object going across the sky. The object was glowing fire orange and with a little red dot in the middle. The object was moving west to east at a fairly slow rate of speed and made now sound. The object appeared to be about half a mile south of us and about half a mile high in the sky. The object was moving on a vertical path and seem to be moving at the same rate of speed the whole time. About the last 10 seconds the object stopped glowing the fire orange and just a small red ball remained and moved up at a 45 degree angle and just disappeared.;30.4494;-86.5701
