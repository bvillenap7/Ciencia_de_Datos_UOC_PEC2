Fast Super Light;2020-05-14 21:53:00;5 minutes;Fast Super Light Standing outside with my husband we seen a bright light- like no other coming our direction just above the tree lines, not even within a few seconds this light traveled from one distance to another, soon passing right over our backyard and shooting directly up into the air where it continued to go farther and farther until out of site . I ran inside to grab my camera to video, I was able to get the object at a distance via video before it disappeared.;30.6832;-81.9273
