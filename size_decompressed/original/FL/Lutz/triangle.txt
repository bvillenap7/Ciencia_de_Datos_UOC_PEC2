Black Triangular Object;2006-12-07 06:00:00;5 sec;My brother was traveling south on 41 when he spotted a black triangular object to the left (east of his location) as well that day (around dusk, early evening).  He said it was just above tree line, hovering over an open pasture.  It didn't make a sound and did not move. I printed pictures of various stealth and other unknown black triangular ufo objects for him to compare.  He picked the one that was an unknown stealth design, possibly a new model.;28.1444765306124;-82.5003794460649
A Triangle sighting... Tampa Palms (North Tampa) Florida on Bruce B. Downs at Super Walmart.;2008-07-07 22:05:00;7 min;7/7/08  10:05 pm-ish  A Triangle sighting... Tampa Palms (North Tampa) Florida on Bruce B. Downs at Super Walmart.  I was walking out of WALMART, and I saw a bubble... or so I thought. At first it seemed to be about 25 feet off the ground and about 50' ahead of me. I kept walking toward it to where my car was... and as I stared at the bubble I wondered how would a bubble survive out here too long? I walked expecting to see it burst any second. It didn't. As I watched it... I then saw it wasn't a bubble at all as it started to get almost above me. I stood next to my car. The attached photo is my Photoshop rendering of what I saw, and its pretty accurate.  It had been cloudy and drizzy, and there was a low canopy of clouds. I noticed it had two round looking lights and a lighter third in front. No lights blinking. The lights were very clear, and not like you'd expect headlights on a plane. I listened for sound and heard nothing. Then I suspected I was seeing something unusual. I then checked and nothing blinking, no stobe, no red beacon. The lights were not REAL bright but were very pronounced resolution-wise... without halo or atmospheric glaring quality. The blueish round lights seem to be directional, like laser light travels, defined. The seemed about 2.5 or 3 feet in diameter. Then as it started to get over top and past Walmart I knew it was not a plane or chopper. I suspected it was a Black Triangle and I watched to see SOMETHING that would reveal it. Then... it slowed down very gradually... and before it had a chance to STOP... it ascended straight up. I appeared to travel UP faster than it did since I spotted it traveling a horizotal flight path. As it moved up, the position of the lights stayed fixed... meaning that it didn't turn nose up to ascend. The bottom stayed facing the earth. It went up what looked like around 700-1000' until it pierced the cloud cover and disappeared.  It made no noise. I detected no outline/SHAPE to it... but the lights suggested a triangle. A plane climbing like that would have made noise!!! This thing moved silenty and very SMOOTHLY. It matched the Triangle video taped at Wesley Chapel a couple months ago... VERY close... minus the blinking read light and the bottom lights were a wider diameter.;28.1444765306124;-82.5003794460649
