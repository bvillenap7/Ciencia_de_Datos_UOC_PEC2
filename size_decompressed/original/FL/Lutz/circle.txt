low hovering with lights circling it simultaneously.;2014-04-19 00:30:00;1-2 minutes;low hovering with lights circling it simultaneously. hard to tell if it was round. i assumed because there we're a few lights that circled around it simultaneously, toohard to say what color the lights were, they blinked too fast, maybe red and yellow or white.  It was flying low like it was going to land then I lost sight.;28.1444765306124;-82.5003794460649
Large, Bright Luminous Circular Body in the Western Sky, Lutz, Florida;2017-02-26 20:25:00;20 minutes;Large, Bright Luminous Circular Body in the Western Sky, Lutz, Florida Approximate time 8:20-8:25 pm, Sunday 2/26/2017.  My husband came back from walking the dog and asked me to go outside with him.   We walked towards the parking area where he showed me a large, bright, luminous body in the sky, with no visible distinction except that it was a very bright object to the west of Lutz.  It hovered in the same place with no movement, possibly no higher than 2,000 feet.  It was not a star, it did not twinkle and it was not a plane, as it was not moving and had no colors.  The object was a bright and luminous. We took pictures and are attaching.  My husband went back outside around 8:50 pm and it was gone.;28.1444765306124;-82.5003794460649
Metallic sphere appears to cloak itself;2020-10-15 08:05:00;1 minute;Metallic sphere appears to cloak itself I happened to look up in the sky when I noticed the sun reflecting off what I assumed was a plane. I noticed immediately that object was a sphere and just hovering/floating. I watched it for about a minute and then it was gone. While I was watching it - it started to fade away into the blue sky but didnâ€™t appear to move.. almost like camouflage or cloaking/invisibility. As I was watching it fade from solid silver object to it almost looked blurred haze around it.;28.1444765306124;-82.5003794460649
