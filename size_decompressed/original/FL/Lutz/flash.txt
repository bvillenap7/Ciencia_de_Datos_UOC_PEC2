The next day there was a very large black helicopter parked at the small airport next to my home. It took off and flew a long search partern over the whole area for some time, flying back and forth in an obvious search grid. The helicopter was unlike anything I'd ever seen. It was enormous with twin rotars. When its motors started the whole neighborhood came out to watch it,the runway being vivible from our street. It wasn't untill a few days later that I made the connection with the strange light Id seen the night before. The light dropped down below the clouds then quickly zipped off at an angle back into the clouds at an incredible speed. My theory is that it was being tracked on radar and this was some sort of evasive manuver. That is why the heliocopter was searching for it, they may have thought it crashed and were searching for wreckage;28.1444765306124;-82.5003794460649
