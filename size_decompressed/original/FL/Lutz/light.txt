There were no sounds or trails left from the object and it disappeared below the tree line.  He saw this object on Sept. 7th when there were so many sightings over the Florida area and he reported that sighting in great detail.  He felt that he should report this also since it looked the same. This information is submitted by MUFON of Hillsborough and Pinellas counties in Florida.  Because this object looks like the reported object seen on Sept. 7th 1999 he felt that it should be documented as often as he sees it in his area.  We have contact with this witness at all times and his testimony is regarded as credible information.

Parade of lights floating across sky without a sound!   ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-22 06:00:00;10 minutes;Parade of lights floating across sky without a sound! This morning at six am my boyfriend and I witness about thirty lights that were solid no flashing lights all traveling in one direction one behind the other. It seemed like they were having a parade some even looked like they were towing one behind them. I walked to the road to see better and they appeared out of nowhere and disappear the same. We have noticed lots of moving lights before but never this many at one time.;28.1444765306124;-82.5003794460649
