Fireballs.;2014-06-05 09:00:00;10 minutes;Fireballs. Husband and I saw first 3 what looked like red fire balls move from west to east.  2 were together then the 3rd one came up real quick as to catch us with the other 2.   Then shortly after those 3 another one, then 2 more.   No noise, but they looked like actual fire balls moving across the sky.
