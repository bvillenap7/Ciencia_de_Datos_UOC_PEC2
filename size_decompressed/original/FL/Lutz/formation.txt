Red star formation.;2016-12-31 19:41:00;20 seconds;Red Star Formation I just finished eating dinner with my family.  Me and my step brother walked outside to launch bottle rockets for New Years.  I looked up and saw a formation of Red star like objects moving in a southwest direction swerving left to right the distance was at a very high altitude.   We were launching fireworks at the time, so I thought it could of been falling ambers from the fireworks, but after the fireworks stopped, the objects kept moving in a southwest direction, then faded away.   I was completely sober and was not drinking.;28.1444765306124;-82.5003794460649
