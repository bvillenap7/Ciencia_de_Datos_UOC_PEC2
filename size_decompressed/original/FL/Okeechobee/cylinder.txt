Bright  white, wingless object, traveling silently at a high altitude;2005-11-11 17:20:00;3 minutes;Bright  white, wingless object, traveling silently at a high altitude Riding my bicycle home from work on Friday evening, along the Lake Okeechobee Scenic Trail, between US 441 and Taylor Creek.   Observed a bright white object, high in the sky moving from SSE to NNW.  No sound, bright white in color, seemed to be smaller in diameter in the middle than on the ends.   Bright cloudless sky, the sun was just setting, and it was high enough in the sky to be brightly illuminated by the sun.   At first I thought it was an airliner, but could not see any wings, or any sign of jet exhaust.   As I don't know what it was, I have to call it unidentifed.;27.2794108695652;-80.8787804347826
