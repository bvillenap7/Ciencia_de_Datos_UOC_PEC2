Three bright red lights over lake Okeechobee;2012-11-08 20:40:00;10 minutes;three bright red lights over lake Okeechobee Was on way home when i noticed a bright glowing Red ball of light hoovering about 1 mile distant over lake Okeechobee.  When i got home i could still see the light it was even brighter so i went and got Binoculars and my Green Laser.   I returned to the front lawn and saw what appeared to be three brights together hoovering.  When i pointed the laser in their direction they vanished! i continued to observe the area for several hours after the event but they didnt return;27.2794108695652;-80.8787804347826
Orange fireballs in a pattern of three, winking out and returning in another location, repeatedly.;2013-11-13 19:45:00;1 hour;Orange fireballs in a pattern of three, winking out and returning in another location, repeatedly. While locking my gate at night, I saw what seemed to be an orange burning object in the sky, approximately 40 degrees above the horizon, and several miles away.  I wondered if it could be an aircraft on fire.  The fireball did not move, then it winked out after seeming to flare up.  It next appeared off to the south of its previous location, and winked out almost immediately, followed by another very brief appearance even farther to the south.  It reminded me of how fireflies will light up in several different places as they travel.  20-30 seconds later it appeared farther to the north and much closer, repeating the previous pattern.  Avon Park Bombing Range is located in that general direction, and I wondered if it might be something having to do with them.   I did see tiny (much, much smaller) white flashing lights of aircraft in three different locations in this general area, however, these seemed much farther away, and flying in predictable patterns, that is to say, as normal flight patterns for aircraft in that area. I drove several miles from my house then on my way to work, and saw these fireballs again in the same general area.  Several people in this area have told me about the Prairie Lights of the Kissimmee Prairie area, but I had not seen them until now.  I will call them UFOs simply because I have no idea what they actually are.;27.2794108695652;-80.8787804347826
