I was walking the dogs around the permiter of my small 6 acre plot when I sat down and was looking at the night sky.  I noticed a bright red star just above the horizon, the red star was located just south of due west,  I guess it was SSW. I then looked up and to my right now looking due west and higher on the horizon.  I  saw a bright yellow light in the western sky flash 8-9 times as it traveled from a northerly direction toward the south and then it disappeared. The light traveled along its course blinking off and on with its trajectory being illuminated, however the flashes were not timed, in other words the space between the flashes were not the same, the final flash indicated the object had traveled about 1/2 again the length of the prior distance between the prior flash. I did not see an object just the flashing light. I told my wife the lights reminded me of the light you see on an EKG only this light was yellow in color not blue.  Then it was just gone, no sound nothing. There were no cows in the field, or if there were they did not respond to the light, also my dogs did not respond to the light. I did not have my phone on me, so I was not able to take a photo;27.2794108695652;-80.8787804347826
4 silent objects at night each with 4 large red non-blinking lights moving east to west near Lake Okeechobee, Fl;2017-12-22 22:00:00;10 minutes;4 silent objects at night each with 4 large red non-blinking lights moving east to west near Lake Okeechobee, Fl Took my dog outside about 10:00 pm Friday, 12/22/17 and saw 2 very dark red bright objects in the dark sky coming toward me east to west.  There was no sound at all even though they seemed to only be as high as a small plane might fly.  Each seemed to have 4 large red lights that did not blink.  The lights defined their shape, 2 behind 2 that almost touched.  Could have been a square shape.  One was a short distance from and a little ahead of the other, and not wavering from their path. I watched them fly overhead until out of sight and then saw 2 more coming from the same direction appearing very much like the first 2 and moving in the same path.  There were a few stars out and also a plane flying north to south so high it was barely visible.  It probably took 4-5 minutes for each pair to move from first sighting to out of sight.  I found it amazing that there was no sound in the quiet night for such large objects. I retired after 27 years with the Okeechobee County Library System.;27.2794108695652;-80.8787804347826
