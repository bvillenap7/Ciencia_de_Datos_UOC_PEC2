Sphere's appear in the room within touching distance and stay for a considerable amount of time.;1969-01-15 23:00:00;15 Min. Plus;Sphere's appear in the room within touching distance and stay for a considerable amount of time. [Very Close Encounter of 1968] This is an account of a very close encounter that took place in the winter of 1968 in Miami, Florida. It was a few weeks after Christmas (1968). I and my future wife (name deleted) were staying with friends for a few days. Around 10 or 11 PM we both laid down to sleep for the night. Let me describe the house a bit this well mean something later. Our friends had put us up on their living room floor with the usual blanket and pillows. The living room was adorned with a large fireplace (no fire, just for decoration I guess) which was at our head and our feet were placed at the opposite end, which to the right was the front door and to the left an open hallway to the kitchen. There was a dim light left on in the kitchen and the living room was dark except for the faint light from the kitchen.  The front door was made of solid wood and had a couple of small windows in the very top, there was also a glass screen type door on the outside with glass top and bottom, both doors were locked for the night. The rest of the room contained the usual items, carpeted floors, coffee and end tables, chairs, lamps, cabinet type stereo etc. The outside of the house was adorned with large trees (maple I believe but not sure of this) and were much taller than the house and shaded it very well. And now on with the story: We hadn't lain down to long I guess and then it came!  Right through the front door to the right of our feet. A ball of light about the size of a soccer ball or a 10-inch paper plate passed right through the glass door and through the wooden door. It immediately went to the ceiling over our heads paused then broke into 5 equal size pieces, danced back and forth and mixed them selves as they danced and hovered over our heads.  Never getting close, as they stayed tight against the ceiling. I remember saying to ((name deleted)), What is that? and here reply, I don't know.  After a few seconds or minutes later one of the shapes broke from the others and started along the ceiling towards our feet and then started down the wall like it was searching for something back and forth, up and down. Let me describe the shape because this is the very interesting part. Like I said it was about 10 inches in diameter and glowed with a bright white light. There was no definite shape to the object other than the approximate size and it was circular. There was no body to the object and yet you could not see through it. All 5 of the objects were equal the best I could tell and were of the same light intensity. The strange part as the object entered the room and broke into 5 there was no light emitting from them (the room stayed dimly lit from the light in the kitchen) yet they were bright white and emitted no light. As the one object broke from the group and was on its search (or whatever it was doing) it cast no shadow on anything or lit anything brighter than itself. The light was so bright from the object that you could not see its true shape other than it was circular and spherical. Being 18, full of vinegar and not really thinking about what I was doing. I got up from where we were laying and started toward the light that was dancing on the wall. ((female's name deleted)) stayed were she was for the time being and watched. I followed the light and was within about 2 ft of it at all times and tried to visually see what it was by stretching my head within touching distance (maybe as close as 1ft.). I peered into it and was straining my eyes to see if I could tell what it was then it started down the wall and was going to go behind the stereo. My first thought was that it was going after the electrical outlet. That's when I got brave and reached out to touch it before it was gone. As soon as got with a few inches of the object it shot with amazing speed upward to the ceiling  (I jumped back out of reaction) and watched it shoot through the front door the other 4 followed one by one as if in a procession line. ((femeale's name deleted)) popped up and we both went to the front door to see where they were going. I twisted the knob the door was lock with a dead bolt. I fumbled around and got the door open and then found the glass screen door lock also. Soon we were outside and seen the lights dancing above the roof of the house (approx. 14 foot off the ground) among an opening in the trees.  They soon grouped together as one again and shot straight up, zigzagged a bit and left at an amazing speed.  I remember saying something to ((female's name deleted)) like I have no idea what it was and her reply, me neither.   We went back inside and secured the house and lay back down. For the next 2 hours or so we heard a jet circle the area. You could here it coming closer and listen to it as it faded off in the distance and then hear it reappeared from another location.  It was definitely circling the area for some reason. I figured radar must have picked up the objects we had seen or something perhaps larger where they had went.  Perhaps the plane was just a coincidence and not related at all, this part doesn't really matter. It was just an observance the same night and we fell asleep listening to it fade away and return. The next morning when we woke, ((name deleted)) didn't mention anything about the night before and I got to thinking it could have been a dream and would keep it to myself till she spoke first. I anxiously got the morning paper hoping there would be something in the news about the aircraft that was circling the area or a clue to what had happened the night before. Nothing in there but the usual garbage, so I dismissed the whole thing as a dream since ((name deleted)) did not mention anything about it for the next few days. Well life went on and ((name deleted)) and I were married and eventually moved to Hanover Indiana. Several years later we were on our way home late one evening (after dark about 9pm or so) with the two girls. And we all saw a shooting star (meteorite) as it streaked across the sky. The first words out of ((name deleted)) mouth was, Remember that time down in Florida we saw the lights in the house?  I almost run off the road!  My God it wasn't a dream after all!  It really did happen!  After we got home and got the kids to bed I pumped ((name deleted)) to see what all she remembered and it was exactly as I did right down to the finest detail. It is really strange that we did not discuss this encounter till 8 years later and it took a meteorite streaking across the sky to open her up. I ask her why see never talked about it before and she said she really didn't know. ((name deleted)) and I were divorced a few months later. I saw her about a year ago and it was brought up in our chatting about our past encounter.  She told me she felt it happened for a purpose and really didn't understand what or why it happened but it defiantly did happen. I have been in search from time to time since to find someone with a similar experience and have posted articles on several UFO message areas and was once the MUFO  (Organization for Mutual UFO's) Fidonet coordinator for Indiana, KY and Ohio.  I have yet to find anything really close to this encounter other than Foo lights and there's not to much talk about them anywhere and really just barely related.  I have no idea what it was but it seemed peaceful, seemed to mean us no harm, did not want touched for some reason and was able to pass through solid objects (wooden door and glass). From this day in 1968 and to the present day I 2000 do believe in UFO's and close encounters and contest that all the is written here is pure fact and not fiction in anyway.  It's really hard to discount something you see with your own eye close-up and have a witness to back it up. ((contributer's name deleted));25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
Corroborating Witness;1975-06-30 20:00:00;20-30 mins;Corroborating Witness I saw a similar report posted here which helped me to narrow down the time frame i remembered. I was in Jr. High at the time of the event since i lived in Miami from 1972-1976 starting in the 5th grade so the 1975 approx date of numerous craft supports what i recall. My father was Director of ((deleted)) for the ((deleted/entertainment)) Company Headquartered in Miami Fl. He had bought a Morgan 25ft sailboat which he kept stored moored at a marinia on Key Biscayne Island (the same one President Nixon had his retreat on) We were all on my dad's boat to spend the night & then to sail the next morning early due to tidal conditions i believe. That night present were myself(13), my brother(18) his best friend(18) my cousin from PA. who was attending the UofM(20) her roommate(unknown age) my mother(50) and my father(53)the boat only slept 5 internally so all the older kids were going to sleep outside on deck near the stern. I remember we were all sitting aft talking and it was dark, it's always darker when you are on the water and the miami skyline always twinkled and had an orange glow due to the city crime lights they used on the street lamps. Now we were all used to seeing the planes that buzzed the beach towing the makers and the tourist helo's that took ppl for joy rides and even the Goodyear blimp, but what we saw that night was most definetly not of this world. I don't recall who noticed it 1st, but we all got to watching a single light that seemed to move very slowly at 1st & then stop, starting from the South Miami area and moved in the direction of North Miami/Hollywood, at 1st their was only 1, then 2 then 3, soon we had a hard time keeping count, these objects would start out white & then change to orange and sometimes pulsing. At times their would be 7 in one area and another 3 in another spot further to the north. These objects would almost increase their radiating light intensity and then slowly almost fade  and in some cases just disappear only to reappear in a different location either north or south of their original position. We took turns looking at them thru binoculars, they were orange with a black hexogonal line pattern on them, but seemed not to have an outer edge due to the glow. I remember getting a frightening chill down my back while looking at them. As i recall, at the peak, there were upwards of 18 of these objects at one time, most centered in the area of the Miami International airport. The event lasted along time, i'd say 20-30 mins at a minimum. During our experience, our flashlights would not work nor our radio, i also remember my dad pointing out how our magnetic compass was just wildly spinning. It was weird, all we could do was sit & watch and i felt so small & helpless. I also recall that the next day in the Miami Herald a story about them was printed because the airport had had to be shut down because these things interfeared with the landing of planes and that they had shown up on radar at the airport, i also remember my mother telling me that 2 fighter jets had been scrambled from Homestead Airforce base to intercept these objects (which i can only assume showed up on their radar) and that when the fighter jets got close, they all disappeared(which would explaine the end of our experience). I am ((in my forties)) now & a father, i served in the U.S. Navy as an Operations Specialist ((technical field)) for almost 8 years and held a Secret clearance. I spent many months at sea looking at the night sky without man made interfearence and i have never seen anything like this remotely similar. These objects moved too fast for conventional means and were not man made objects, i'll take that to my grave. I to have also looked for similar accounts of this incident on the web, but have yet so far been unable to locate such info. I hope that my corroboration of seeing this event gives the other report on this the creedence it deserves. I swear on my family name and as a man that the above account is turthful & honest to the best of my ability. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

On January 7, 2005,  sphere like objects were noticed in digital pics during photo session of Comet Macholz.;2005-01-07 20:30:00;MOMENTARY;On January 7, 2005,  sphere like objects were noticed in digital pics during photo session of Comet Macholz. I didn't know where to send these photographs I took during the comet [Machholz] fly by in January of this year (2005). These were to be it's final appearance nights from my vantage points in Southern Miami along Biscayne Bay. In fact, all shots were taken of the Southern view from my apartment terrace.  Take note that Turkey Nuclear power plant would be also due south of this vantage point.  I am not sure what significance that would have on the objects I saw but I just wanted to mention that in this correspondence.  I have compiled a lot of the photos together after viewing them carefully. I didn't want to be mistaken about this.  On that night, of January 7, 2005, I was preparing to take photos of the comet with my two digital cameras. I had also set up my telescope in hopes of getting some real close shots. It was about 8 or 9 pm and I thought of just testing the cameras out before actually viewing with the telescope.  Without a flash, I proceeded to take several consecutive shots using all settings of SQ, HQ, and SHQ  to determine what would give me the best clarity of the moment. I also took shots with a flash as to bring in the buildings across the lake. This dark and light exposure would give me a perspective of distance. If the flash proved to be too bright to capture the comet and it's surrounding stars, I was going to refrain from that usage and just concentrate on keeping the camera as still as possible on the tripod and hope for the best. As the results will show, I got more than I expected to. I downloaded the first set on to my computer to view and possible see if I caught the right detail of the comet. The shots without the flash were scanned and then I got to the pics that used a flash.  I saw something odd in the pictures. Some sort of cylindrical shapes were showing up. ODD...........I never saw that before and I have taken thousand of pics at the night sky. I have an Olympus program on my computer that enabled me to magnify, clarify, and view the objects at closer range. They appeared to be circular in shape with a distinct indentation at an angle of the sphere. Now where did I see that before.  The memory of the first Star Wars episode came to mind and I was thinking back of that same shape exhibited in the film. DEATHSTAR. Now that was real strange. As I continued to scan the photos, I saw that there was not one object but several, ranging in size from distant to close enough to touch. The flash of the camera must have reflected it's fast light on these objects and for some reason produced the image or should I say images.  All the photos I have included are original and without tampering of except for enhancement of the shots themselves. I needed some answers on this because to me it is just too unexplainable. As I researched further on the net, I found some comaparisons that are just too coincendtal. And then, not too long after these pictures were taken, an event of captured moons of Saturn..........was it Saturn or Jupiter?....... Were shown on several sites and news pages of a moon that looked very similar to the shapes I had captured on that cool night in January. I hope someone can clarify this data I am sending you. Have these objects been around all the time or have they just appeared for my benefit? Is there something going on (not again), that the human public is unaware of? And why are there so many? Usually a person can capture a UFO or whatever, and it's a single image of one object. Sometimes you might see two, three, or even four. But this many in one area of the sky. My sincere hope is just to get this information out to the people so they can decide for themselves and the experts can debate over what they really were.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
Tamiami Executive airport, bright star moving at irregular speeds.;2008-12-19 05:49:00;1 1/2 minutes;Tamiami Executive airport, bright star moving at irregular speeds. As I walked to my bus stop to catch my shuttle to my aviation school, up in the distance from a southern direction about a 1/2 mile away from where I was, I noticed a very large bright white star . As I looked back up to look at this so called star, I noticed it was moving in a northerly direction toward me. As it moved Above me at about 500ft-1000ft. its speed reduce form about 60MPH to about 15MPH. it was extremely bright and it did not emit any sound what so ever.

And as it passed over me it kept in northerly direction it sped up to a to about 200MPH gradually over Tamiami executive airport, which is about a half mile form where I was at the moment and reside. And I lost sight of the craft in just a minutes in 10 mile visibility.

2 Cirular objects with a reddish/ orange light move across the downtown Miami;2011-02-20 21:30:00;4 minutes;2 Cirular objects with a reddish/ orange light move across the downtown Miami On the Sunday February 20, 2011, at about 9:30pm, my wife and I along with 3 other church members, noticed 2 round objects flying in formation.  At first, I thought it was 2 Silver metallic balloons, but right away both objects turn on a reddish/orange light located on the middle bottom of the craft.   There was absolutely no sound of jets of any propulsion sounds, this despite the object being about 1000 ft. in the air.   Both objects flew from the Miami bay in a direction east to west crossing downtown.   The objects flew towards the airport yet the odd thing was their direction was against the air traffic at that moment.  I am wondering if anyone else saw what we saw.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
Appx  20 or more twinkling star like objects traveling north eastward over Miami on April 17, 2011.;2011-04-17 17:40:00;10 to 15 minutes;Appx  20 or more twinkling star like objects traveling north eastward over Miami on April 17, 2011. On the evening of  the 17th of April, 2011 at approximately 5:40pm I observed 3 small points of light in the sky just underneath very dark clouds.  At this time we were driving west bound on SW 88th St (Kendall Drive) and the objects were high in the sky.  Since we were driving home I lost sight of them.  About 2 minutes later we arrived in front of our home, I ran out of the car to see if I would see the objects and found a spot  near the lake for a clear, unobstructed view.  It took me a few moments before I saw 3 star like objects in the sky headed in a north westerly direction.  They looked to be twinkling or flickering on and off and also seemed small and orb like.  As I stood there more and more began to appear. The weather conditions were very cloudy with dark to light grey clouds in the sky, but as you looked west it seemed to be clearing up and plenty of sun light was coming from the west.  I believe that the sky was clearing just over and around Shark Valley Everglades National Park.  I believe this is important because I realize now that this was most likely the cause of the objects appearing to twinkle or flicker.  They seamed to be metallic and able to reflect or shine light from this source.  In addition, I would like to mention, that it was not raining. The direction I was facing on the lake was north. At first all I saw were objects to the north that seem to just disappear  into the clouds once they hit the northerly point, but then I started to look further to the east and noticed that the objects would begin appearing exactly 90 degress from the north ( towards the east) and I was not able to track them coming in from further south. I also realized that the new local hospital was having its grand opening and started to think it might be metallic balloons from the hospitals grand opening.  Only problem was that these objects were traveling fast and appearing high in the sky in the east as a small twinkle and then, although small, as they traveled north east they would look slightly larger in size having enough mass I could more easily follow the objects.  Just to make it clear I was facing north and my arms spread to a 90 degree angle (left arm directly north, right arm east). I had to question myself about the possibility they were balloons and check myself, but I have seen runaway balloons and they were not.  The movement was steady and fast and they all seemed to travel along just right underneath the clouds. These objects seemed to be coming from a distance near the turnpike (5.4 linear miles)  on Kendall Drive from my home and traveling north east towards the casino. I also noticed airplanes on their normal flight path over the everglades near the casino area heading towards Miami International Airport for landing. In comparison these objects, I believe, were much smaller making them appear farther. From the moment they appeared on the east to the moment they disappeared in the north it only took the objects 30 to 40 sec from point to point. Some of them looked to be traveling a bit faster than others at times. In total I saw approximately 20. Please also note I could not hear sounds from these objects like you would fighter planes. Near by is Homestead Air Force Base, but had these planes flown by you can easily see it’s a plane. I checked the wind direction on-line at:   http://www.usairnet.com/cgi-bin/Winds/Aloft.cgi?location=MIA&hour=06&course=azimuth   The winds at that moment and using a 6 hour forecast were all pointing east, from 3000 feet, and south east in higher elevations.  Had these been balloons they would be traveling against the wind. I hope this has been helpful.  My 15 yr old son was with me and witnessed seeing some of these objects as well.  I am a 34 year old female that works in the admitting dept at a hospital neat Miami International Airport.  I've had an interest in shows involving UFO's, but had never, till yesterday, seen what I believe were UFO's.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
Sphere shaped object which drifted slowly and seemed to disappear and reappear numerous times.;2011-10-05 19:00:00;20 seconds;Sphere shaped object which drifted slowly and seemed to disappear and reappear numerous times. I was driving with my sister and niece when i saw something in the sky very much near the airport. I originally gained interest because it was just too high and too near the airport to be an airplane, being that airplanes are either descending or ascending in that area. It was a special object which seemed to almost have an aura around it.  My sister and I were both looking at it when we mentioned it to one another. It drifted, very slowly, from east to west. It was almost slug like. As it drifted, it seemed to almost disappear at times but would regenerate right after.  My sister claimed to lose sight of it, but i maintained an eye on it. It did that about two times and just shortly after its last reappearance, its completely disappeared again. The most compelling thing about it was that there were ABSOLUTELY NO clouds in the area which it was in.  It was also nothing like an airplane in that it didnt have that distinctive shape nor did it have a trail. Which is a characteristic of airplanes that fly at that altitude.  It also moved so slowely that it was surreal. The closest thing that I could compare its disappearing and reappearing to, would be how a flat object with a lot of surface area is clearly visible, but when its rotated to a side view, its nearly invisible.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
