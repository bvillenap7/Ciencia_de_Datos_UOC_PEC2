RE Six stars in a vertical line, moving all at the same speed.;1997-07-23 23:00:00;3 minutes;RE Six stars in a vertical line, moving all at the same speed. When I previously entered my report I should have been more specific. I neglected to mention that these stars or lights that i witnessed were NOT in our atmosphere. And that when they did fly away, they moved at the speed of light. Or at least what I understand light speed to be from watching movies) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
Six stars in a vertical line, moving all at the same speed.;1997-07-23 23:00:00;3 minutes;I was sitting outside in my back yard at about 11:00p.m.  I had a rose garden w/a table and chairs placed in the center for recreation.  I’d often go out there at all hours of the day, so 11p.m. wasn’t unusual.  At one moment I happened to be glancing at the sky, when I noticed what appeared to be a vertical line formation of about six (if I remember correctly) stars all moving at the same time.  It actually took a couple of seconds for it to sink in.  I mean if I understand correctly, this isn’t exactly normal star behavior.  Six stars in a vertical line, moving all at the same speed.  I watched them for several seconds and then all at the same time they just stopped.  They stayed that way for several more seconds before the top one shot off in a northeast direction.   Then after a few more seconds all of the rest of the stars scattered in different directions and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Low flying UFO sighted in the Kendall Florida Area;2002-01-15 19:30:00;5 minutes;Low flying UFO sighted in the Kendall Florida Area While driving down a street next to a dimly lit park, we noticed a bright red flair-like light in the sky.  At first, it had a sort of tail like a comet, but it faded away.  The light continued to glideforward through the sky till it slowed down (almost to a hault) and split into 3 red lights, but a less intense red.  The first object continued on the same path, but the other two stayed behind to form a triangle and became a white halogen light.  The two lights that were left behind aligned parellel to each other.  Those two lights began going up and down (like the cylenders of an engine) and dissapeared into space as the first light (which was still red)continued on the same path and dissapeared into the sky as well.  Shortly after the sighting, when the car was parked and the key was out of the ignition, one of the windows was left down.  Out of coincedense, the passenger pushed the button for the window to go up (without the key in the ignition)and the window rolled up.  To our surprise, all of the windows were operating with the car completely off.  After a minute or so, the windows stopped (almost like the battery died).  After we had dinner and came home we were observing the sky around the area where we previously sighted the UFO.  There was a military search plane (we know this because one of us had served in the army) circling the same area we had seen the object an hour earlier.  It circled around a few times, almost like it was trying to find the UFO.  We assumed they must have picked it up on radar because it seemed to be flighing low.  It was very strange.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
Four starlike objects, arranged in a quadrilateral formation seen over Miami;2003-11-01 21:00:00;60 seconds;Four starlike objects, arranged in a quadrilateral formation seen over Miami Four star-like objects were observed in a trapeziodal formation. All were moving in a South-Easterly direction. One of the four was also moving towards the other three. I proceeded to call someone else, and during this time I had lost visual contact with the objects. Shortly after I was able to reclaim visual contact. By this time the four objects had arranged themselves in a very close,linear format with one of the four slightly offcenter. The four objects continued in their southeastern direction.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
A ballet of lights circling in the sky;2004-08-12 20:00:00;2 minutes;A ballet of lights circling in the sky Having been extremely busy, I entered this on a piece of paper with other sightings that have been documented.  After going through some paperwork, I found the notation and feel it is very important to have this documented with the Center.  On the evening of August 12,2004, approximately 8:00 p.m., my husband and I were in the front yard after dinner.  I went back in the house for a moment, and my husband yelled for me to hurry outside again.  I ran out, looked in the sky: a hundred stars were in a circle in the western sky, moving in a clockwise direction, all white lights, no noise.  After a minute, the objects began scattering in every direction, north, south, east and west, as if something had scared them. Still in sight, they all disappeared.  It was a beautiful, but eery sight. ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports from Miami for this time and date.  We have corrected the time above, which should be 2000 hrs., not 1800 hrs..

Strange lights over Miami, FL;2006-04-02 04:00:00;2 hours;Strange lights over Miami, FL Looking from the north from a high elevation to the City of Miami, FL and to the Southwest over the city I observed what appeared to be 3 to 4 lines of changing hollow characters, rimed in white, traveling from top to bottom and then lights like a giant firefly moved from west to east. It appeared like a reverse light projection.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
Formation over Miami may ,06;2006-05-15 21:10:00;4-5-mins;Formation over Miami may, 06 5 or 6 objects were flying from a Southeast to northwest last night . They flashed white and flew far apart from each other but in unison flashed on and off, flew fast and at a greater altitude then the air plains in the area!  It was a formation for sure my whole family saw the formation and it was unreal!  My brother has seen things like this before but this was a firts for me!  My father who is Christian and believes in God also saw it.   I could not explain this to my self.    Please get back to me if you hear about the same siting!  Miami Fl in the Kendall lakes area!

These objects were not known man made aircraft.;2009-01-10 21:10:00;2 minutes;These objects were not known man made aircraft. On January 10 2009, 2110 hrs, I took a break from watching a movie (paused it) and went outside to smoke a cigarette. I enjoy looking up to the night sky especially on clear nights when clouds are at a minimum or none are present (the latter applies to this event) and visibility is excellent. On this night I was smoking my cigarette when I noticed a commercial and most likely civilian aircraft making its aerial maneuvers for approach for a landing at Miami Int’l Airport. This is typical at the area where I live since aircraft traffic is directed through this area for landing approach. I did not think too much of it given the fact that I see aircrafts performing routine maneuvers on a daily basis. On this night, however, I noticed two objects flying through the night sky (no particular shape) in a constant formation on the background (relative to the aircraft making its northward turn) of the commercial aircraft. These objects were being displaced at a relatively high velocity (or speed, since their general direction and displacement seemed constant). At first I thought that I was seeing “things” and removed my eyeglasses and cleared my eyes. I went ahead and put my glasses on and saw the objects again. The commercial aircraft had a northward direction to while the objects had a general northwest heading. Military aircraft came to my mind in trying to identify the objects but no audible noises were emanating form the objects and no beacon/strobe lights were visible. Unless there are stop secret military stealth aircraft out there flying hypersonic with silent engines (especially at the altitudes these objects were flying) that the civilian population does not know about, I think this classifies as a UFO event. Furthermore, as they traveled in their direction (by the way, one object was leading the other by approximately a couple of thousand feet,  at approximately a 30° elevation, measured relative to the trailing object) their emitted visible lighting was fading. I am very skeptical about UFO sightings and associated reports on the tabloids. The main reason is probably because I am an engineer and to me almost everything in life has an explanation through engineering and science. This is the first time in my life that I have encountered a physical event that I do not know what to make of it. By the way, I am certain that these objects were not satellites. I am becoming more convinced that we (habitants of planet earth) are not alone in the universe.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
Lights in the sky wink out in the vicinity of Turkey Point;2012-06-22 20:45:00;1 min;Lights in the sky wink out in the vicinity of Turkey Point My wife and I just got on the Turnpike at 40th St and as we looked down the highway, we saw 3 lights in the direction of SSE close together in a straight line. I got interested because In my 30+ years in aviation, I have not seen landing lights so big and strong on an airplane. I kept looking at the lights and I said, its a bird, is it a plane.   Mi wife said:&quotI know what you are looking at. You better look where you drive and I will look at the lights.&quot I said:&quotyes, and when you say wow, it will be too late!&quot Just as I said that, the middle light dimmed, left and right lights alternately blinked on and off and it disappeared. On further reflection, I realized it was very near or above the Turkey Point nuclear reactor, which fits the profile of many other sightings.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
V shape formation. Slow motion and altitude.;2012-09-23 21:00:00;10 seconds;V shape formation. Slow motion and altitude. Down town Miami. Partially cloudy.  Very quiet night. Observation made from 5 floor. Bay view balcony outdoors. Direction of the formation NE to SW.
