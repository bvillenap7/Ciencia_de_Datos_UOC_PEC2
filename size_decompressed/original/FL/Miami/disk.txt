It first appeared rising from the glow of city lights west of us. At first I thought it was an airplne leaving MIA, but quickly thought otherwise as there was an orangish pulsating glow around it. It's speed seemed incredible. As it neared us it appeared to be disk like with green & red lights alternately around its edge. When it was about overhead it ssuddenly shot straight up & then headed north as a circular glow that very quickly dissapeared. The other three observers were my wife, an author, who owned the boat & his wife. The next day my wife & my friend independantly phoned the Miami Herald to ask if NASA had sent anything into space, & if anyone had reported anything unusual in the skies. The answers were negative. We kept quiet less our friends & business associates miht think us looney. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
I saw 6 bright lights in the sky ( that were'nt airplanes. I can tell you that );2001-05-12 12:00:00;5 hrs.;I saw 6 bright lights in the sky ( that were'nt airplanes. I can tell you that ) it all started out on a cleat night in May. Me and my friends were sitting on my lawn when all of a sudden I spotted a large light. Now I was really into UFOs so i recogonized that this object we where seeing was a UFO. I told my friends hey guys I think thats a UFO. They all laughed, but as they were laughing all six of the objects came towards us. They flashed a light at us that was so bright. It was probably the brightest light I had ever ever seen . I cant remember anything ellse. All I know is that the next morning I was in my bed. I dont know if I was aubducted or what? I m acctually really scared. I dont want to think that I was abducted by aliens. .....Well thats basically it. You may not believe me ( just like every one ellse. ) But I am telling you the truth.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

Red, White, Green Moving so slightly In working late on my computer I sat on the back porch for a smoke late at night. I noticed the shape in the south sky high above Miami area.  It changed colors, white, red and green, looking like blue flashes inbetween.  I looked at it through binoculars, then tryed to record it on disk with a digital camera, but  would not pick it up.  I tryed with the cam corder, but could not pick it up.  I awoke my wife and daughter and we watched it for twenty minutes. It is still there as I type now. It has moved West a small bit.  It is not a star, not a aircraft. It apears very much to be in the atmosphere and therefore not a satelite.  For the first time in my life, I do believe I have actually seen a craft, not of this world.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
 UFO disc-shaped object hovering over sky.;2001-10-12 22:00:00;15 minutes;October 12, 2001, Miami, Florida:  UFO disc shaped object hovering over sky. Sometime between 9 and 10 p.m. on October 2001 (could have been a Wed. or Fri.), me my brother and a friend all climbed up to the roof of our apartments.  I remember my parents weren't home that night. we would just hang out point lasers a cars.  But this night something caught out eyes in the sky. our apartment had 5 floors plus the roof. so we had a pretty good view of the shape of the object. I'd say it was t least a mile or two from eye distance.  It was disc shaped. we noticed it stayed in place for about 5-10 minutes then it started rotating in its spot very slowly. With all 3 different colors flashing around it. bright green, blue and red..  Oh and no sound! whatsoever it was as silent as can be! no way it could have been an airplane or helicopter. we were in awe and were saying wow this is a ufo!  I remember my friend saying he thought he was going to cry! we used to live very close to Miami international airport.  and this craft was hovering above some big trees in the area . It was kind of like a mini forest, which those trees have been cut down ever since. Well after the 10-15 minutes of it rotating on its spot it finally moved to the right and went in back of one of the tress and we never saw it again. I truly believe it was UFO not from this planet!   Also I'm sure other people driving around that area probably got a better glimpse of this object than we did.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
UFO disk over Miami 2001;2001-10-14 10:00:00;20 minutes;UFO disk over Miami 2001 had a sighting back on october 12 or 14, 2001. me , my brother and a friend were standing on top of our apartment's roof back then. we were young then..  I was 15, brother and friend 13. we lived close by Miami International airport at the time and that night my parents were away so we used to go out to the roof of the building to point lasers. sometime around 9:40 pm- 10:20 pm we saw a disk shaped object just hovering over the night sky (a clear night sky too)  i guess it would have been facing north from our direction. there used to be some trees somewhere when you drove by milam dairy road and 72 ave.. near what used to be Radisson hotel.. well the object was clearly a disk with different colors going around it.. red, green , blue notibally. it remained in its spot spinning around for about 15 mins. it wasn't an airplane, or blimp, or helicopter.. it made no noise. We were freaking out a bit because we knew we were witnessing something out of this world. then after 15 mins the silver disk began moving slowly to the right and in back of the trees i said before and never saw it again.  I know we couldn't be the only ones who saw this that night. we didn't have any cameras back then or cell phones to record it.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
A big UFO, disk shape, light blue color, but intense, was seen tonight at 19:00 pm in Miami;2003-02-02 19:00:00;20 minutes;A big UFO, disk shape, light blue color, but intense, was seen tonight at 19:00 pm in Miami I was talking with my sister in the living room of my apartment, facing the balcony when suddenly, just in front of my eyes I observed a perfect shape of a sourcer like those that show up in the movies, a disk shape, light blue color, but intense. I told my sister that it was an UFO behind her, and we rapidly ran to open the balcony in order to see it closely. But it was not necessary, because it was very clear to see. It was a really big one. Like a half moon but bigger in diameter. It stopped for a while, maybe 2 or 3 minutes in front of us, until it started to move from west to east and dissapeared. While it was happened, I called my brother, who lives in other place but in the same area (South Miami). He went outside, and he could see the same fenomena. Ten or 15 minutes later, we were still in shock, chatting with him by internet, when the same object came back from the east where it dissapeared, to return to the west, but moving faster. I was trying to take a picture, but I was on the other room of my apartment where some trees did not allowed me to get a good one, but I'm very possitive about it was the same object we saw minutes before. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found her to be quite sincere and credible.  Another of her family members, who has also submitted a report here, witnessed the object from another part of the city of Miami.  We had no other reports.  If any of our readers know of a blimp in the area of Miami on this date, we would appreciate a message, identifying the aircraft.  PD));25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

I went out to look because my sister called me to tell me about it. I saw it just over the city horizon towards the south, It was moving slowly from west to east, after almost 3 minutes it got cover by the trees and the houses. It was very big almost like a Zeppelin but I think It was not one. It had lights all over, blinking ligts but not very bright.Later on like after 20 or 25 minutes It came back in the opposite direction but I only saw it further away.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

Last night at a few minutes after 4 am I awoke and I looked out and saw 2 disk shaped objects moving north parallel to each other. I knelt up in bed to see the second one pass the other. Than the first one passed the other and slow down. Both staying on the same plane. This happened 3 times when they both turned right or east. The speed was amazing. There was a commercial jet in the backround and I noticed it. The 2 objects diapeared.   There were no blinking lights on either object. They both had the color of etched glass. A light source that seemed to come from within. I would estimate the distance from me of between 2000-4000 feet away. I called the regional airport control tower that was right under their path. No one answered. I called back at 7 am and they said that no one is in the tower till 6am but they would give me a # to call. Here I am. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at considerable length, and we found him to be a seemingly exceptionally credible witness.  His description of the two objects, and the manner in which they moved across the sky, and relative to each other, was quite objective and precise.  Based on that conversation, we suspect that this report is quite accurate.  PD));25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
Round glow passes over Miami from East to North West, faster than a jet plane at low altitude;2004-05-15 21:00:00;5 seconds;Round glow passes over Miami from East to North West, faster than a jet plane at low altitude Clear sky.  Stars visible.  Gentle breeze.  While cooking a steak on my grill, I spotted a pinkish/red DISK rushing across the sky, from east to north west.  Dut to the tree canopy above, I only saw this object for about 5 seconds.  If it was a jet plane (as was my initial thought), I expected to hear the thunder of its jets (as it would have been flying very low to cross this much sky in such a brief amount of time).  THERE WAS NO SOUND!!!  I've been interested in UFO's for a long time (30 yrs), and must confess that I have never spotted something in the sky that I could not identify.  I was an amateur astronomer while in college, and after.  This object was definitely NOT astronomical, because of its angular motion.  It could only have been an aircraft... but there was NO sound.  The UFO could have been a baloon, but the wind speed was not strong enough to push this object across so much sky in such a brief period of time.  The object was definitely round, about one-half the moon's diameter (1/4 degree?). It had a pinkish/red glow, and I think that I saw a bright spot in its center.  An aircraft (even a jet) moving this fast, would have had to been below 5,000 feet, and I would have definitely been able to resolve its navigation lights... but no.  Only one centeral fuzzy light, surrounded by a glowing ring of dust!  I'll be the first to admit it, as a trained observer, this was my first actual observation of something unidentified.  I'd be interested in hearing if others in south Florida saw this this eveing!;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
Location:  Miami, Florida.  The incident occurred between 8:51 and 8:53pm Eastern Time.  The observers cannot be more precise about the;2005-01-07 20:51:00;10 Seconds;Location:  Miami, Florida.  The incident occurred between 8:51 and 8:53pm Eastern Time.  The observers cannot be more precise about the time.  Friday, January 07, 2005.  The night sky at that time was cloudless.  There were two observers: ((name deleted/witness #1)), ((name deleted/witness #2)).  Dr. ((witness #1)) is a retired clinical psychologist and amateur astronomer.  Mr. ((witness #2)) is an ((deleted)) teacher with a ((deleted)) degree in education.  Neither have any history of UFO sightings, and Dr. ((witness #1)) describes himself as a UFO skeptic.  The object moved from East to West at a very high rate of speed, covering about 90 degrees of arc in about 10 seconds, when it was lost in the sky glow of the city to our west.  Its speed was constant but it clearly and distinctly changed directions (perhaps 30 degrees) two different times.  There was absolutely no sound associated with the object.  There were no aircraft in the vicinity at the time, and the aircraft seen that night were taking off from the west of the observers’ location, traveling east, and were all at low altitude, making them obvious.  The object’s angular size was very small, subtending only about 3-6 minutes of arc.  It was clearly NOT an astronomical object of any type, as Dr. ((witness #1)) is an amateur astronomer and accustomed to looking at meteors, comets, nebulae, galaxies.  It contained no red lights, no green lights.  Mr. ((witness #2)) described it as having a color of dull orange-red.  Dr. ((witness #1)) could not discern any particular color other than a grayish hue.  It was only modestly luminous, similar to perhaps a 3-4th magnitude star, but was clearly larger than a point-source like a star.  It had a definite shape that was unlike an aircraft or a meteor.  It had a definite shape that was best described as a circle with a line through it.  It moved at a right angle to the line through the dot.  Dr. ((witness #1)) was not certain whether it emitted a dim light of its own or merely reflected light from the city below, but it was clearly NOT as bright as some of the brightest stars.  The observers are absolutely drawing no conclusions as to what the object was, but strongly agree that it was not a conventional aircraft, a meteor, or any natural phenomenon.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

I saw various small flying disks traveling together and that looked very much like toys.;2007-01-22 17:30:00;app. 5 minutes;I saw various small flying disks traveling together and that looked very much like toys. The sighting happened today during traffic hours in a very busy avenue.  I first saw a small flying saucer that looked very much like a toy.  The center circle moved rapidly, but the outer disk did not move.  It had a blue blinking light bulb on each side of the outer disk and I noticed that the direction of the object was well centered to the lights.  That is, that the lights were always on the side of this flying object as if they were the wings of a plane.  I immediately thought it was a remote control toy but what really caught my attention is that this one flying saucer was followed by another one, and another one after that, etc.  There were about 5 or 6 of them flying together one after the other.  They were going slow, at about 25 miles per hour and bordering the backyards of the houses that were parallel to this avenue.  They were flying parallel to the avenue.  At this point, I still thought they were kids playing from the backyards, but when I noticed these disks were not turning around, I realized it had to be something else.  They kept on going along the avenue. Two of them went up and moved slightly to the right and I was able to keep them in sight until they were two microscopic dots in the sky. I know that someone else must have seen it because this happened in the middle of Miami during traffic hours.  The objects were small, about the size of a large round pizza which led me to believe immediately that it had to be a toy.  I can’t imagine that it could be used for traveling.  I have never heard of such small size aliens.  I imagine that they could be used to scan an area, etc.  All I know is that they were small they traveled at a steady pace and about 25 miles per hour and very close to the trees.   They were gray in the center section which spinned and black on the outer disk with blue blinking lights. I still find it difficult to imagine they were space crafts because they really looked like a toy.   However, I can’t explain how they were able to travel for such a long distance, especially the two crafts that went up in the sky until they became unnoticeable.   I am still shocked and would love to understand what happened.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

Around 12:30 A.M. on July 20, 2007 I was looking towards Miami Beach. Then I saw a green light come from the west at a very rapid speed. It stopped at a distance of a couple of football fields away in the air. It made no sound but it had a color of bright green. It stayed stationary for about 3 seconds and then it speeded off to the west. I turned to the side to tell my friend to look at it when it was stationary and my friend looked up and then it speeded off. But he also was able to see the UFO. When this happened i realized that it was not a glare or my mind playing tricks on me but it was an actual UFO and not a shooting star.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

Saw three yellow/orange rotating disc shaped crafts move rapidly throughout the night's sky before disappearing;2020-01-02 00:00:00;10-15 minutes;Saw three yellow/orange rotating disc shaped crafts move rapidly throughout the night's sky before disappearing. On the night of January 1st, 2020, at around 11:55 EST I was standing on the balcony of my friend’s apartment on the 10th floor of his building.  I immediately noticed three strange glowing lights in the sky.  At first I assumed that they were some sort of balloons or drones floating in the wind, at which point I clearly realized that they could not be, as they were far too high in the sky.  They emitted no sound, and there was no trace of any exhaust.  The lights did not blink as a plane would.  Instead, the objects were continuously lit, though it appeared that the area of the objects that were lit varied over time.  At some points it would seem as if areas that were previously unlit became lit, though it was not a jarring contrast as with turning on a light switch, it was much more fluid.  This could be attributed to the fact that the objects were rotating. At first it appeared as if they were milling about in the sky, adhering to no particular flight path or course, simply slowly cascading about through the sky.  A few minutes into watching them, they appeared to consolidate into a triangular formation.  They maintained this formation, each maintaining the same distance from the other two, though they changed their orientation in the sky.  They did not appear to move about a central axis, but instead moved in relation to the other two.  It was an extremely fluid motion that felt intelligent in nature as opposed to the result of some natural phenomenon. The most striking and unnerving aspect of this encounter was the fact that these objects were CLEARLY rotating. I did not notice whether they were rotating in unison or each at their own pace, but each object was clearly rotating in a manner that seemed to be quite rapid.  After a few minutes, around 12:10 AM on Jan 2nd 2020, the objects—without changing their apparent orientation—grew smaller and smaller in the sky until they began to twinkle.  I assumed this phenomenon was occurring because the objects travelled very far away from us very quickly.  They then disappeared.  The entire encounter lasted 10-15 minutes. Throughout the encounter, it appeared that the objects went from being 2-5 miles in altitude to an impossibly far distance from the surface of the Earth.  They also changed their orientation in the sky quite rapidly, maneuvering in a way that seemed to be impossible to me given the extreme acceleration and immediate deceleration that would be required to move that way.  They went from being practically on the horizon to an orientation that required us to strain our necks to look up in a matter of seconds. Throughout the encounter my friend and I were so shocked that we unfortunately did not document the incident as properly as I would have hoped.  We managed to capture a video though it was hard to focus the camera on the objects in the sky.  However, the video still shows the unusual nature of the objects, as well as some of the characteristics I previously described.  The video will be submitted to NUFORC along with this report for your reference.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
