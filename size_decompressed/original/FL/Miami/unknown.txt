Red and Green light in the sky.;1999-10-01 20:00:00;25 sec.;Red and Green light in the sky. I was driving home from work app. 45 minutes past dark, when I noticed a red and green light in the sky. The lights were at app. 40 degrees elevation and due west of my position. The lights were a red and a green light, even spaced from the ground, almost looking like aircraft lights. The red was on the right and the green on the left.I observed the lights while driving on an E to W road, and at first, thought they were from an aircraft. When I reached the topsign at the end of the road, i lost sight of it through the trees. After a right and a quick left, I searched for the object again, but it had vanished. The object appeared to be motionless, and was fairly close to my position during the sighting.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

The tower was closed so we were communicating with flight servisis on the tower frequency 118.9. We were cleared for a landing to full stop on runway 9left. on final approach we noticed a number of lights approching the airport heading 270. they were spread out across the width of the airport and seemed to be manuvering strangely. at least two of lights were slowly circling  others verticaly. all of the lights were moving in unison. We informed flight services of incoming traffic in the opposite direction after a few seconds they cam back a told us that earlier in the day there had been a helicopter fly by at a funeral. I didn't think so because of the manuevers and the fact that it was at night. But they advised me not to be conserned that they would probably use the helecopter approach before getting to the airport. We continued on and landed keeping an eye on the opposite approching traffic. All so obsered that the color of the lights were not standard in that some of them were blue and orange as well as yellow white and red. After landing we pulled off the runway and stopped to watch the lights. they seemed to be all separated none of them were attached to another. about a quarter of a mile out they all turned north heading 360 degrees and few off that way. we watch untill they were out of sight. Spoke again with miami radio on 118.9 they told us they had no contact with the lights either on radar or by radio. They appeared to be at 1000 feet or patter altitude and we saw them fly into miami class B airspace. no mention of the incident appeared in any paper or other media. There were two green, two white, two red, two blue, and one orage lights. They turned north with out any visable bank or change in formation they just all made a right turn and marched off. Niether I nor the other pilot in the plane have ever seen anything like that before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Invisible Jet or I'm Blind.;2003-11-17 16:45:00;1 min;Invisible Jet or I'm Blind. Southwest Miami, Fl. Nov.17. About 4:45 Pm. Sun getting low in the west. Bright clear sky. I live about 20 miles northwest of Homestead reserve Air base. I'm acustome to seeing & hearing military jets from there. They have a distinct sound from a civilian jetliners.  Working in the front yard I heard that military jet sound relatively close overhead as usual. Upon looking to see one of the beautiful F-16's or F-18's I was surprised to find I couldn't see anything.  The loud engine sound traversed from southeast of me(Homestead) to the northwest. I'm aware that higher flying craft can be somewhat ahead of the apparent location of the sound. I searched the sky for the entire time of the relatively slow, directly overhead passage. I have excellent eye sight and have seen very high flying jetliners so high that the sound couldn't be heard, but this is just the opposite. This is the 3rd time I've experienced this in the last 6 months. Interested to know if anyone in this area has experienced this strange situation.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
It looked like a star and moved in a circular pattern.;2004-04-05 20:35:00;1 minute;It looked like a star and moved in a circular pattern. It looked like any star you would see in the night sky of any large city.  It moved around in a circular pattern. Then it disapeard in less than a minute.  I live in downtown Miami in an 18th floor apartment and have seen lots of airplanes and helicopters flying around. This was not one of those.  Being someone who has not really thought much about UFO's I thought maybe it might a Turkey Vulture flying around.  But I don't think they fly at night being that they Scavenge for food during the daytime and by this time of year they are heading back up north as the weather warms.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
UFO over Miami;2009-07-13 22:00:00;Still Here;UFO over Miami I live on the 26th floor, downtown Miami and I was on the balcony to watch the launch of the NASA Endevour.  Me and my wife saw it take off at about 20:45.  About an hour later 3 lights appeared high in the sky (they are still here) blinking lights moving REALLY fast and then staying still in a very high altitute from what I can tell.  One of them at about 22:00 was flying really low over the port of Miami maybe for five minutes until an aircraft (ours) and a helicopter came, I guess to see what it was, the object dissapeared, our aircraft made a turn and went back the way it came from.

At first, we thought we were seeing  two  helicopters in the sky but  noticed  as they were moving from South to North in straight pattern that the lights will change from solid red to orange simultaniously, like a strobe light, and then when both  objects came to a stop, the lights went back to solid red.  All of a sudden the closest light to the South faded away and disappeared.  Then a couple seconds after, the light closest to North began to fade away and also disappeared in the sky.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
red lights over miami florida;2011-01-01 00:38:00;35 to 45 seconds;red lights over miami florida I am reporting a sighting I had on January 01, 2011, at approximately 1238 a.m. location is Miami Florida. I observed five to six objects flying from south to north on the western side of the sky. The objects appeared to be at different altitudes from each other but in formation. They where approximately at 45 to 50 degrees from the horizon. At first I thought  they were meteors. However, I observed them for 35 to 45 seconds. 	  I used my binoculars to take a closer look. The light they emitted were the  color of road flares and were very bright. They would dim slightly and become bright again. The altitude appeared to be to high for a helicopter and was about the usual altitude that airplanes take when approaching an airport. I could see the light appeared to be located at the bottom of the craft and there were no navigation lights on the craft. I have seen fighter jets flying at night and these did not appear to be jets. They were traveling at a speed slightly faster than a commercial jet and maintained a straight course except for changing altitude. I lost sight of them due to ground obstructions.  Approximately 10 minutes passed and I observed one more object flare up and take a similar flight course to the previous 5. I observed this object for approximately 25 to 30 seconds until I lost sight of it due to ground obstructions and light pollution.  I called a someone who was in Orlando at the time and told that person what I had observed. This person observed something similar approximately 10 to 15 minutes after my incident. I hope someone else observed what I did and maybe can provide a logical explanation.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

It had no visible navigational lights and was black in color.  Saw it for approximately 10 minutes before I lost sight of it due to the sun going down.  It appeared to just float in one spot floating sightly up or down.  I used some power lines in the area to gauge it's movement.  The wind was blowing east and the object appeared to be moving west or not at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

A bright red light flew across the sky from the east, and no noise what so ever came from this light.;2011-07-24 22:30:00;3 minutes;a bright red light flew across the sky from the east, and no noise what so ever came from this light. While I was walking my dog at approximately 10:30 I saw a red light in the eastern sky.  The red light was the same size and intensity as an exploding rocket from a firework.  It's speed seemed to be the same as that of an airplane. As it got closer the light seemed to get weaker, but I could still see the light.  The object seemed to go straight over my head, unknown exactly how high it was. The most fascinating part of this event was, it made no noise what so ever.  The exact same thing happened two more times within the next 5 to 10 minutes.  These objects traveled across the sky from east to west, and I watched them slowly disappear into the western sky.  Their red light seemed to be the most intense when I spotted them in the east, and slowly disappeared as the flew overhead and towards the west.  Unfortunately, I was not able to see a craft, only the light as it flew by.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

Triangular formation that disburses.;2011-11-16 20:13:00;20 seconds;triangular formation that disburses. As I was arriving at my house I noticed a triangular formation facing east perpendicular to SW 56th street in Miami Florida.   At first I thought it was just an airplane but I then noticed it did not have the lights that standard aircraft have.   I slowed down my car and pulled out my cell phone and started to record. The UFOs did not emit any sound and were flying in a perfect triangular formation.  I was able to record a few seconds before the UFOs disappeared from view.  As I got off of my car and ran to my grandfather to tell him more appeared.  I did not record those and I feel incredibly stupid for not doing so but I was so excited as I saw more slowly appear in the sky as they came from the ground.  There were about 9 in total. As I was speaking to my grandfather while standing outside I observed that the lights would turn off after about 20 seconds. Interestingly, the objects were still visible after the lights turned off and maintained the same altitude as they continued South. After about the 9th object, they stopped appearing.

Daylight glinting UFO spotted.;2016-12-29 11:00:00;5 minutes;Day-light glinting UFO spotted. On December 29, 2016, I took my daughter and son, as well as my son’s friend, to the zoo.  It was a sunny day and the sky was blue with some scattered cumulus clouds.   At approximately 11:00 am we were exiting an exhibit, when I noticed something glint in the eastern sky.  I stopped to look and it glinted again.  I could not discern its altitude however whatever was flashing (reflecting?) light was stationary.  The glinting occurred every 5 seconds or so.  I pointed out the object to my son and his friend.  They both acknowledged seeing it glint.  As I was pointing out the object to them, another zoo patron walked by me and said to me, “You see it too…huh?”  I smiled and nodded at him.  He kept on walking. My son, his friend and I observed this stationary glinting object for 5 minutes or so, before it just disappeared.  I did not see again for the remainder of the time we were at the zoo.  The object was too far away to discern any detail.  I have no idea what I saw.  I did try to take pictures of the object with my phone, but nothing came out on the pictures I took.  To my chagrin, I did not think of taking video of the object.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
Hovering and moving object seen over South Beach, Miami;2018-06-05 20:00:00;2 hours;Hovering and moving object seen over South Beach, Miami I was at South Beach Miami at the time of the event around 830pm.  I was laying on my beach towel looking up at the sky when I saw an object moving in a strange way.  At first I thought it may be a plane because I was close to the airport, but it was not moving like a plane.  It would hover, and then slowly move in any direction, sometimes in a circular type way.  It was too far away to really tell the shape of the object.  At first glance you would think it was a bright star.  There was also a smaller and dimmer object near it that also appeared to be moving and hovering.   I watched them for two hours hoping I would catch it fly away into night sky or something to affirm my suspicion.  There were a couple times the object moved quite fast, but for a short distance.  A little after 1030pm I had to leave because the cops were shooing people off the beach (it closes at 10).  I started packing my things and I looked back up at the sky and the object was gone. I started walking toward the city and I saw the two objects moving toward the city as well at a fairly decent speed.  I continued to follow the objects until they stopped to continue hovering. I had to leave because my phone was almost dead.  I was able to catch a little video, but it is pretty bad quality.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
