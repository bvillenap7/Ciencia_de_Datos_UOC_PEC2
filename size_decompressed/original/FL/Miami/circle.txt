Big round red pulsating, plasma like ball in S. FL heading west & disappearing from view;1998-12-23 22:00:00;3 minutes;Big round red pulsating, plasma like ball in S. FL heading west & disappearing from view My husband & I went out to a local restaurant to meet with out of town relatives that came for the Holidays. This was a family restaurant where no liquor is served.  Just a regular night out with family members in their 40's & 50's and a couple of kids.   I went out to the parking lot to get some family photos I left in the car, when I looked next to me I saw a couple & another woman, not with the couple, looking up in awe & when I looked up I saw a round red pulsating ball just hovering right above us (wouldn't move, like it was watching us) facing north, s. of Miami intl airport close to our home in Coral Gables. It looked alive, like a red plasma of sort - no other colors, no tails & no sound. It was about 2000 feet up in the air & it was big & beautiful red blob. It was about 4 full moons in size. I was in total awe & wanted my husband to see this so I ran inside the restaurant to get him & he sensed my desperation & came right out(took about 2 seconds)& the red ball was moving west (towards the everglades) becoming smaller & smaller until it was the size of a little red pinhead & it disappeared west somewhere.  Well, I'm glad I had my husband witness this with me so he didn't think I was crazy. We were sort of in shock and casually walked inside,remained silent & didn't say anything for fear of the family thinking we were nuts.  We have kept this to ourselves for about 5 yrs. We just hope that the other 3 unknown people in that parking lot that night will come out & say something about this spectacular event that has changed the way we view life.

At approximately 1:30am on October 12,2001 a dark circle hovered over my neighborhood in Miami (Kendall),Fl.  After finishing a movie with my friend, I proceeded to walk him out to his car to say goodnight. As I stopped briefly to turn on the porch lights my friend walked out to the driveway. As I walked out the front door he was standing next to his car staring up into the night sky with his mouth wide open. As I glanced up, I saw what I could only describe as a stealthy black disk almost directly above us. By stealth, I mean that it was silent and as it passed between us and the light cast by the moon over a thin layer of clouds (like fog) it's sillouette became visible. It was perfectly round and blacked-out.  The disk appeared to hover for approximately 5-10 seconds then shifted from left to right in a zig-zag pattern. Suddenly it began moving to the south at a slow rate of speed. Then in a flash, it sped off at an unbelievable rate of velocity.  My friend and I agreed that what we witnessed was exceptional. So much so, that we still talk about it to this day.  I firmly believe that because the atmospheric conditions were just right that evening is the only reason we could see the disk. Without the clouds illuminated by the moon I don't think we would have noticed it.  I always catch myself looking up at night now, wondering if on those dark moonless nights how many disks might be up there.

From one huge light to three and then five, in the shape of an L, then vertical to a horizontal line, the lights faded after 10 min.;2010-02-28 18:50:00;roughly 10 min;From one huge light to three and then five, in the shape of an L, then vertical to a horizontal line, the lights faded after 10 min. I was facing South as my boyfriend and I left Wal-Mart, when suddenly out of the clouds appeared what at first seemed to be a falling star, but then I realized it was not traveling too fast. So, then I thought “ok maybe it is a comet or meteor” when suddenly what I saw it split into three white circles in a backwards “L” shape.  I was not too far from home, so I immediately called my dad and told him to go outside and face south. He saw what my boyfriend and I had seen, and then, it split into five circles. We were amazed and going crazy trying to figure out what it was. As we drove as far South as we could we noticed the five circles of light were vertically straight. Trees got in the way of my view, but when I managed to get another glimpse of it, it was horizontally straight. We saw a plane that appeared to be heading in the same direction and then it took a turn away from it. I am not sure it had to do anything with what we saw, but it seemed interesting. The five circle! s of light clustered a bit closer together and quickly faded out of sight. I did try to take pictures of these mysterious orbs in the sky in the duration of about ten minutes that this was going on, but my camera phone could not capture something at the distance of the lights, which I want to say was possibly twenty to thirty miles away. Relative to the size of full moon that was out at the time, I would say it was about one eighth of the size (and the moon was big and low around 1850 hours), or about three times the size of the North Star, or maybe even the size of a light bulb twenty to thirty feet away. I am sure more people had to see it if they were going south of Krome Avenue. This is not the first time I see something of this interest in the sky and I am certain that we are not alone.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

My husband, daughter and I run outside and look up east-NE to see a pecuiar bright object hovering in the sky. We stared at in wonder trying to figure out what it was. It just looked out of place and was different. I ran inside to get my zoom camera and decide to take a picture to see if I can identify it better. What came out made us all gasp in amazement. It was round and had a red aura surrounding it. It started to move and I quickly focused the camera for one last shot before it disappeared. I am still shaking. The image that came out was creepy. I caught it zooming upward in a split second. A gov't plane then flew by in the direction of the object. Weird. I still don't know what I saw.

Both light were crossing each other in speeds I've never seen.  Hard to explain in writing but I know none of the army crafts can take those speeds and stop instantly mid air. I was nervous taking the picture because I was taking a curve, go figure another blurry picture. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

Six orange glow orbs across Wynwood, Miami, FL.;2015-02-01 00:20:00;45 seconds;Six orange glow orbs across Wynwood, Miami, FL. O O O   O O O   As I'm walking my dog to the backyard of my apartment, thought a plane caught my eyes, but its wasn't a plane...(just like above).   It was the glowing orange, at steady speed coming from north, to southwest.   I was speechless, but figure I should report.  Maybe it'll help to know where they are heading from last time you seen it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
5 moving orange circles in the night sky;2015-06-05 22:00:00;10 minutes;5 moving orange circles in the night sky Driving inside my community I looked up at the sky and noticed 3 orange colored circles in the sky.  The objects were moving in the same direction and very close to each other so I knew they couldn't be airplanes or stars.   I recorded the images and slowly one by one disappeared into the night sky.   When I arrived at my house and parked my car, I told my 2 neighbors that were outside and started to show them the video.   Then I looked up at the sky and noticed 2 more which my neighbors also saw.   We stayed looking up asking ourselves what it could be and then they also disappeared.

I saw golden twin crafts, in total eight, but two at a time.;2016-04-10 20:27:00;5 minutes;I saw golden twin crafts, in total eight, but two at a time. April 10th I spent the sunset meditating with a very spiritual friend in an open field.  At about 8:20, I walk home, and upon arriving to my back yard, a golden circle craft appears to the distance.   About 5 seconds later a twin craft appears and moves together toward the star Sirius.  I say on the film thank you, you are beautiful, we love you.  One vanishes and the other goes on for and 4 seconds.   When it disappears I look at the moon for a few seconds and then look back the original spot, to my surprise I see two more golden crafts looks together, with the same exact coordination as the last two.   When they vanish, I look to the moon at repeat this sighting, with the result of seeing 8 crafts, all in pairs of two.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

I noticed an bright orange circular object floating slowly mid sky.  It looked like it was barely moving.  Then I saw a plane with red flashing lights.  The second plane was moving faster than the first object.   The second plane looked like a jet, it moved directly towards the first object.  The first object then moved or tried to maneuver away twice.   The jet then circular around the moved directly over the top of the first object.   Then the first object moved slowly downward and the simply and completely vanshied.  The jet continue to search around in the same area then left after about 15 minutes.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

3 Star like crafts in New Years 2018;2018-01-01 00:00:00;~10 minutes +;3 Star like crafts in New Years 2018 My husband and I went your to watch fireworks at midnight. Looking up at the sky we saw one light that looked like a star moving quickly.  In front of the moon and near the Big Dipper.  Then we noticed a star looking craft also moving across.  The game together moving around one another then a third craft came.  They were definitely moving and joined together to make contact.  They remained there for a long time and they got more distant because we could still see them but they were harder to see because they were farther alway.  Not a drone.  Too high and they looked just like stars.  One of the first sightings I’ve had. We assume that they were observing earth during our celebration.  Maybe you will see some crafts tonight and I hope others spotted them.  They actually may still be up there if you look now near the Big Dipper and moon.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
