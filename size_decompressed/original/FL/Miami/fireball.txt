I live in a tall bldg near bye the MIA/AEP - Clear night full moon on top, taking out my telescope from the balcony observed flying east bound targeting the AEP a fireball. Wind was calm and planes departing to the east contrary of the object direction. Using my binoculars saw an AA plane at 3Kft 150m/p/h, the fireball was at 4500ft and the plane at 27 AVE & 7 NW ST turned to the south east direction, that was the encounter point. Followed the object that near 37 AVE & 7 NW ST turned North and the fireball turned off. I followed with the binoculars and the back was like a silver coin. No Beacon, No red or green light, no a chopper or balloon, wind was calm. Checked at MIA DEP, AA got a flight to Santiago Chile, departed at 21:09. I bet that the MIA/AEP radar must have something or AA Pilot.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
