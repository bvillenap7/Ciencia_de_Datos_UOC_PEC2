It was between 6 to 8 feet long and and about 4ft. in hieght. There is only about 12ft of distance between both houses so it couldnt have been very wide.We could see them looking at us as we looked at them. it just hovered there for at least ten seconds until it zipped away with flashing speed.My parents got divorced later that year.My older brother had to see a shrink due to his fear of the dark/ufos shortly after. Ive never spoken about this outside of the family before.My brother gets very uptight whenever I bring up the subject.My mom also avoids the subject.We all know what we saw and I at least have no doubt.                           NOTE: the craft had  a humming sound to it;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
