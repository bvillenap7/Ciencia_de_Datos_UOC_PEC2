I was at home by the pool with my little cousin, and he was telling to look up because there were UFO's in the sky, I was trying to explain to him they were no UFO's, I was telling him they were those stars that look as if they were moving, and while we were looking up, we saw something coming from high up in the sky, in front of us, and then, when it got to like, the fence(it was flying low now) it, just flew away, real fast, leaving a trail of bright between brown and purple light. when the object was aproaching us, it was kinda like hovering, or not hovering, but flying really slow, it was a v shaped object, it had all these lights, like, blue, purple, green, and a lot of brown lights, and it looked like it was made out of some kind of metal, but like a blueish metal. when it approached us, electricity ran through our bodies, and when it left, it made this incredibly deafening sound like that of when breaking the wind.

I could certainly not call it a craft, but rather a bright object in the ski that looked like a star.;2001-10-08 22:30:00;10 minutes;I could certainly not call it a craft, but rather a bright object in the ski that looked like a star. My wife had been walking the dog, and came in to tell me that she had seen a strange blue light in the ski. She was concerned about terrorist activity, and wanted me to see it. I rushed out. I was it instantly. It appeared to be the size and intensity of a very bright star but perhaps brighter than the brightest star. It had blueinsh cast.  Over the ten minute period that I observed it, it moved very rapidly, yet erratically, over a broad area of the ski. Its movement seemed to be quite erratic, reminding me more of the movement of a bat (but not the appearance of one)in flight. It might move in a straight line for no more than a second, then switch directions for another second, and then continue this erratic movement. It was dark and just beginning to rain and I could not see if there were clouds. It did not appear to disappear behind clouds. It did not flicker, and remained totally visible unless I would lose sight of it behind a tree. When this happened, within a second or so, it would reappear from behind the object. In spite of the erratic and random nature of its movement, it did seem to be confined to a reasonably small area of the ski. I would estimate the horizontal boudaries of its excursion to be perhaps 30 or 40 degrees, and the vertical, perhaps a little less. After a minute or so of watching it, I ran into the house to grab a video camera and ran out to try to catch it on video. I was never able to get it into the view finder, a failure that I found rather disturbing, sine I am very adept at video movies. For what it is worth, not once did I get a glimps of it in the view finder. I speculated that the intensity was not sufficient or that it was moving too fast for me to catch it, though the latter does not seem to be a reasonable explanation. Eventually, it disappeared by moving behind a tree, down toward the horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we found him to be an exceptionally good witness.  He sounded quite credible, and his educational background and experience allowed him to describe the event quite lucidly and unambiguously.  A very good report.

All of a sudden my husband pointed out a boomerang shaped shadow in the western sky moving north to south.  It had an iridesenct glow about it, then it disappeared.  After about 5 minutes, the three of us saw the boomerang shaped object flying but with orange lights.  It was again in teh western sky moving north to south quickly.  An airplane coming from the eastern side movnig west to east, we thought there would be a collision, but all of a sudden teh boomerang shaped craft hovered then disappeared.

What thought to be stars that suddenly moved.;2003-11-03 18:30:00;30 min;What thought to be stars that suddenly moved. At 6:30 pm on 11/03/03 I was outisde smoking and looking up at the sky before going to work as I do everyday. Looked at the moon and a couple of stars, one of the stars begins to move torward the direction of the moon, at first I thought it was a plane, then figured it might be a satellite. When it came to the moon edge, it did not come out the other end as it should of, thought maybe nothing. About 15 mins later, I was still looking up and a little bit east of the first one I noticed another faint star move a shorter distance and then faded off. After about 5 mins after that , high altitude planes start showing up, 3 to be exact, 2 of them made a perfect X with trailing fog, smoke or what ever. It has been in my mind all this time wondering. I've seen falling stars, planes , etc. But, this did not seem to normal for me. Just thought I'd share in case;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
Unusual object traveled at rapid speed across Miami nighttime sky;2005-01-07 20:51:00;10 sec.;Unusual object traveled at rapid speed across Miami nighttime sky On the evening of January 7, 2005, I was with my friend in his back yard observing the comet Machholz, through his telescope.  It was a relatively clear evening in that part of Miami and we eventually turned our attention to the constellation of Taurus.  Sometime between 8:51-8:53 p.m. that evening, while viewing the constellation without the aid of the telescope, a moving object traveling through that section of sky caught my attention.  I have seen shooting stars and satellites before and this did not resemble either.  It was like no sky object I had seen before.  I made sure my friend’s attention was focused on the object as I asked him what he thought it could be.  It stayed visible for about 10 seconds as we discussed and tracked it in an east to west direction across the sky.  I dismissed the possibility that it was a plane since it moved much too swiftly, there was no engine sound, and had no noticeable navigational lighting.  My friend concurred.  It appeared to me to have what I describe as a dull, orange-red glow.  Its intensity and shape did not change as it passed over us.  It did, however, deviate slightly and rapidly from a straight line path two times before disappearing into the skyglow.  The object had a shape that was wider than it was long with a bulge in the center.  It traveled with the wider side oriented from north to south.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

At 8:00 p.m. looking at the northern sky, there were no clouds.  A dark shadow entered the northern sky moving south at a very high velocity.  As it passed, it lit up in bright white lights, non blinking.  As it passed, it circled from east to west, then continued heading southward.  Then completely disappeared.  There were no sounds and no aircrafts during this sighting or for three minutes thereafter.  Five minutes later, we spotted a bright light moving at a very fast speed, going   southwest to northeast for.  We followed this movement for approximately two minutes, then it disappeared.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

The twist comes in that they showed the picture which was found supposedly in the dumpster and it was CLEARLY not the dual tanked shuttle but was a Saturn 5/Apollo mission lifting off with several UFO's surrounding it mainly around the command module. Unmistakeable.   I am 50 years and know an Apollo mission from a shuttle mission.  I waited till 18:00 and the clip was not shown again.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

I was out in the front yard barbequing with a friend. Jupiter was very visible and bright that night so I began to stare up at Jupiter.  A few seconds later I noticed an object moving from (my) left to (my) right about 5,000 feet up around fast moving stratocumulus clouds.  It had no sound and no lights.  The moon made it easy to see the object but it was sort of translucent like glass so it blended in with the night sky and the clouds pretty well. It was moving pretty fast but not too fast to miss. It was shaped like an arrowhead so it was similar to a triangle but it looked more like this: >   I then lost it in the clouds and by the time it would have exited the clouds, it would have been too far away to spot.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

It was dark brown and lifeless, only to be seen by the reflection of the city lights.  It made made no sounds, nor did it have any signs of fuel burning from an exhaust...  According to my iPhone compass app. the object appeared to be at 45* degree angle approx. 4 to 5 thousand feet above.  The app. further recorded the following: 263* W ^+6 @ 4693 from the location we were @ 25*42'55N-80*27'02W. When we called for everyone else outside, it faded away steadily from our horizon towards the dark sky, until it blended into the nightfall as a dimming star, until we were no longer able to see it. Should you require a pic of the compass app we captured, it's available.  Moreover, we each decided to draw a pic of what we saw without showing it to each other until drawn, the two drawings were very similar.

It was huge and moves smoothly.   That Manta has no lights at all, no sound.  It has like a gray or white border around the shape ant that is the reason I can tell it was like a Manta Ray.

Invisible flying saucer exhausts and top revealed by sunsent over miami;2016-08-13 19:10:00;5-10 seconds;Invisible Flying saucer exhausts and top revealed by sunsent over miami I was driving today from Collins Avenue to the west (north Miami direction), looking for an autoparts shop because today I got a “maintance required” light up in my control panel which I found very strange because everything in the car seems to be fine, oils levels, coolant level, even battery levels, everything was working but nevertheless the light was on.   So I cross the bridges over the water, and I am looking at this very impressive summer sunsent, with very strange and massive clouds around it, and suddenly I see something out of place.  (time around 7:10/7:11 pm)  I see something shining in between the clouds (in the direction of the sunset), but with a shape that does not appear to be natural at all.  I could see the exhaust glowing on the left side of what appear to be a huge ufo, an under glowing too, and over it what appear to be like a city over it, picture when you see the top of a navy carrier, that’s what it look like on the top of the huge ufo.  I was driving and over a bridge so I couldn’t stop to see it without risking to be part of a car accident.   I pull out my phone, while driving, and tried to take a picture, but I could not get it. I did got the time which is enough giving the facts.  Now, before I get call crazy or whatever, I want to state clearly that the whole structure was not visible, the only parts visible where the ones I describe before, the exhaust on the left side and under and the shining of the sun on the top structure.  If this is actually a ufo, it was extremely big and most probably was inside the atmosphere because I guess the reflection effect is not the same if you are in space.  But I don’t know, I am not a weather expert. I want to add, today was a very strange day weather wise.  It was full of clouds that looked like columns, it wasn’t raining but the sky was full of electrical activity.  I am completely sure that if this was an UFO there is no way, no way, the radars would miss it, it was just to enormous.   I would love to know if there were any radar “anomalies” today over Miami.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
