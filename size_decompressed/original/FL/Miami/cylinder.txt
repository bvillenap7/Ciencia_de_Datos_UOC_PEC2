Cylindrical object, no visible wings, moving slightly upward despite nose pointed downward, vanished suddenly;2004-06-26 13:45:00;30 seconds;Cylindrical object, no visible wings, moving slightly upward despite nose pointed downward, vanished suddenly I'm within sight of Ft. Lauderdale Airport and the Atlantic Ocean, and I'm used to seeing helicopters closeby and jets approaching from the west and taking off to the east, over the ocean. Light planes are also fairly common to see I'm never surprised to see them and they're very recognizable.  Today, however, I saw a cylindrical object moving across the sky to my immediate west. At first I thought it was a jetliner, but several things about it stood out. First, it was headed north, which would eventually take it into the path of inbound traffic to FLL secondly, I could not determine its altitude. It was also moving at a peculiar orientation, i.e., it appeared to be rising slightly but its nose seemed to be pitched slightly downward. Most significantly, I couldn't see any wings.  The shy had scattered clouds, but none of any size - the sky was (and is now) a bright blue. I blinked my eyes and turned my head away for about two seconds, and when I looked back it had vanished. I jumped up and went out on my balcony (I'm on the 24th floor with a panoramic view), but couldn't find it anywhere.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

Long, red/orange, cylindrical object floats over Biscayne Bay, FL;2008-12-06 17:00:00;20 minutes;Long, red/orange, cylindrical object floats over Biscayne Bay, FL Late afternoon - downtown Miami. Large, long, hotdog shaped object seemed to float around right in the path of incoming airliners headed for MIA.  The long, cylindrical object was red or orange, maybe 100 feet long, and seemed to float instead of hover.  A 777 flew right past the object on its landing pattern, and therefore I was able to scale the object with a 200 ft long aircraft.  It also had a slight bend in it, lending to the notion that it was 'hot dog shaped'.  (It sounds funny, but ut us true! I couldn't believe my eyes I had to hang up on my girlfriend just to watch this thing float over Biscayne Bay.   It eventually floated to an altitude that was so high I eventually lost sight of it.

Large 300 ft long cylinder craft was hovering and had two large multicolored stripes on each triangular end.;2012-07-08 03:30:00;5 minutes;Large 300 ft long cylinder craft was hovering and had two large multicolored stripes on each triangular end. July 8, 2012:  LARGE CRAFT  	On July 8, 2012, at approximately 3:30 am, my wife saw a huge craft, about the size of a football field, maybe double that size, about 1/2 mile from our house.  We live in the Killian area of Miami and our best estimate is that the craft was near or above the Miami Zoo. Our dog is very sick and throwing up and she went to open the door in front of our house so the dog can go to the bathroom.  When she looked up, in a south-westerly direction, she saw the craft at approximately a 45 degree angle. Attached is a drawing of the craft made by my wife.  It was shaped like a cylinder but with pointed edges on both sides which appeared triangular shaped on each end.   The right and left sides, inside the triangle portion of the edges, had two large bands of extremely bright multi-colored lights on each side.  The middle part of the craft appeared very light whitish or grey colored. The craft made an extremely loud noise, much more powerful than if an airplane was standing directly above us.  The object remained stationary for about 5 minutes and then it disappeared. We have attached a drawing of the object, a map showing the location of our house and the location of the Miami zoo area, and a weather chart indicating that the visibility was 10 miles, and that there were scattered clouds at 3:30 am that night.  My wife said that she saw many stars in the sky that night and thus she had excellent visibility. SUMMARY  	Previous to these events, my wife and I have never seen UFOS or other similar objects in our life. She is not bothered by this because she is very religious thinks that they were a messenger from God.  I, on the other hand, have been freaked out.  I started doing research on the subject, have joined MUFON, ordered about 30 UFO books, listen daily to Coast to Coast, etc, etc.  I never even knew that these radio programs or UFO organizations existed.   I am now consumed by the subject.  I need to find some answers and some closure because my wife says that I became obsessed with this issue. Finally, I am an attorney with the IRS in Miami, FL and my wife was trained as a physical therapist and is a stay-at-home mom.  We live in a very nice upper middle class neighborhood in the Killian area of Miami, Florida.  We have lead normal dull lives until recently.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
