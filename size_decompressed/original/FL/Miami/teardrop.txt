UFO lights in night sky, one came down and was wittnessed by young girl.;1975-11-16 03:00:00;1 hour;UFO lights in night sky, one came down and was wittnessed by young girl. At around 3:00 am at  XXXXX SW 39th Terrace, Miami, Florida 33175.    On November 16th 1975, I was awake and looking out the window in my bedroom at the sky.   As I was scanning, and looking for different stars, I saw about 12 lights moving around each other.  Then the lights grouped into pairs of two, and went into different directions.  Two of the lights began to fly into the direction of my area, and then they began to come down and as they descended the light they emitted changed color.  As near as I can remember, they started out as white light, then red, then orange, then yellow, then blue. I lost site of one of them, but one came over the yard in back of my house, between my house and the neighborâ€™s house.  The light was very blue and everything seemed bathed in that light. It was a craft that was mostly teardrop shaped. It had lights in the front and on top and it kept dipping slightly in the front, as it hovered there.  There was a sound, but I cannot explain it.  I have never heard it before or since.  I became terrified and I tried to drop down to the side of my bed and crawl under it, but just as I started to move, I saw a very bright burst of light and I think I was knocked out.  When I came to, it was around 4:45 am.  I was shaken, and when my Mother got up to start breakfast, I told her about it.   My Mother had turned on the radio and we heard the news man tell about a police officer in Dade land who reported a UFO. I have never spoken of this to anyone else, and was afraid to report it.  I did not want to look crazy.  I have never forgotten it though, and lately saw footage of similar lights on a tv show.  It prompted me, and I have now made a report of my incident.

ufo sighted in the hammocks ,miami fl.;2003-02-06 19:51:00;1min aprox;ufo sighted in the hammocks ,miami fl. my dad and i were driving along 88st approaching 157ave when i looked to the right and noticed in a near distance a oval like object hovering over some lights.At first i thought it might be a air blimp, but then i started studdying the object and noticed it had an oval like shape but one end of it didn't look to be the same proportion so it could have been more like a tear like in shape , however this is looking at the object from almost a profile perspective.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
