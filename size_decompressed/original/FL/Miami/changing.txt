OCTOBER 1969 UFO SIGHTING BY ENTIRE FAMILY;1969-10-15 19:00:00;MINUTES;OCTOBER 1969 UFO SIGHTING BY ENTIRE FAMILY ON OCTOBER OF 1969, I WAS 9 YEARS OLD.  THE OLDEST OF 5 SIBLINGS. IM ONLY TELLING THIS NOW AT 52 YEARS OF AGE BECAUSE MY FATHER DID NOT ALLOW US TO TELL OF THIS EVENT.  HE HAS SINCE PASSED AWAY AND IT'S TIME I TELL SOMEONE. MY FAMILY AND I WERE TAKING A WALK TO A NEAR BY PARK.  THE SUN HAD BEGUN TO SET. AS WE ARE WALKING I LOOKED UP INTO THE EVENING SKY AND SAW A VERY LARGE BRIGHT STAR.  IT SEEMED TO BE GROWING LARGER AND LARGER BY THE MINUTE.  I KEPT TUGGING AT MY FATHER'S PANT LEG FOR HIM TO LOOK UP.   WHEN HE FINALLY DID...THE STAR WAS HOVERING SILENTLY ABOVE US.  IT HAD CHANGED SHAPE.  IT WAS NOW A DISK, BUT A SOLID COLOR...IT WAS AS IF YOU WERE LOOKING INTO A LIQUID MIRROR. SHADES OF SILVER, LIGHT BLUE, AND PURPLES.   IT REMAINED THERE FOR A FEW MOMENTS AS WE HUDDLED TOGETHER IN FEAR...BUT MY FATHER KEPT REASSURING US THAT IT WAS OK.   THE OBJECT DISAPEARED INSTANTLY AND LEFT A GREY CIRCULAR OR SPIRAL SHAPE IN THE SKY. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Bright lights hovering and going in and out of orchestrated formations;2010-10-10 23:00:00;Approx. 20 mins;Bright lights hovering and going in and out of orchestrated formations I have been scouring for 2 days the web sites trying to locate a report on a sighting which my partner and I and several neighbors on our neighborhood saw on the night of October 10th, 2010 and finally found a reference on your site. I will describe what we saw and have been seeking an explanation for since that night. No news reports have covered it.  11:00pm (approximately)  My partner had just gone to bed and I, a smoker like to sit outside the front door and smoke a cigarette as I do not smoke inside. I saw towards the Eastern sky a large ball of red which at first thought was a low flying plane's headlights. I found this strange as the light was very bright red/orange rather than white. All of the sudden, the light split into 3 distinct lights, very bright, same color but shaped in a perfect triangle. The lights seemed to hover a bit closer then suddenly split into a perfect line. This all happened within a couple of seconds - that fast.  The one light on the end started to hover away from the others for a bit and then the others followed. I stepped out onto the street at this point and watched them hover ever closer until they were almost above me. Their formation kept varying.  Sometime they would regroup and then another would hover away from the other - off to the side and then the others would stay still.  The one away from the others would rejoin the line and then continue moving.  It was very surreal. I noticed at this point that #1) there was no sound whatsoever associated with them and #2) they were not part of one object but rather each a distinct and separate object as it was a clear night and I could see up into the very clear night sky between each object. I followed them with my eyes until they went over house and tree line and then disappeared. I could no longer see them but then I noticed way up in the sky, almost appearing to be part of the stars little twinkling red lights moving in a formation. Previously, the objects had hovered over me at about the approximate height of what you would think of a rescue helicopter flying - I'd approximate about 800 - 1000 feet.  The now appeared to be flying in formation as high as a jet.  Again, this all happened within seconds.  I thought that was the end and I was left thinking about what I had just seen.  Just then, I turned and looked back towards where they had come and noticed another line of same identical objects. I quickly yelled for my partner to wake up and come outside which he did. We watched first 3 then 3 or 4 more all line up and again, hover over us. Both were wondering what they were as our neighbors across the street pulled in from work and came out to walk their dog. We pointed the lights out to them and they too stood there with us watching the strange lights. More lights came - approximately 10 in total.  My partner and I also witnessed together the rapid ascend into the night sky. I had pulled out my 300mm lens and my Nikon camera to try and photograph them but because of how dark it was I couldn't get the automatic focus to focus in properly on the objects and allow me to take a picture. I was however able to use it as a telescope/binocular of sorts and catch glimpses of them. My partner also took note that they had indeed disappeared into the night sky and became far distant twinkling red lights which seemed to fly in formation until they vanished.  I've been searching on sites including youtube videos of similar reports and I have found the following which look identical to what we saw that night.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Imtq1_OxqPE  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaBjkjndDUg  I hope you can shed some light on this subject.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
Domed Orb Craft with 2 green lights and shooting white bursts changes to Plasma Cylinder;2012-03-31 07:00:00;30 minutes;Domed Orb Craft with 2 green lights and shooting white bursts changes to Plasma Cylinder March 31, 2012:  ORB  AND  PLASMA  CYLINDER   On Saturday, March 31, 2012, my wife and I also saw two different objects in the corner of the first floor of our house. At approximately 7 am that day, our dog barked and she went to bring him outside.  When she went downstairs, she saw a glowing ¾ orb with a dome top and flat bottom.  It was approximately 2 ft in width and 1.5 ft in height.  The object had two vertical lights inside which blinked green pulsating light.  Facing the object, on our left side, bottom part, the object emitted bursts of very bright white light, some long and some short.  The object was located near a corner wall and appeared to be floating about 5 feet off the ground. My wife started to pray and started to telepathically talk with the object.  My wife thought it was some kind of heavenly angel.  The object seemed to respond by emitting the white bursts and more blinking of the green lights.  She was grabbing our dog at the time, and our dog had just had a stroke and was walking in a paralyzed fashion--  limping to one side real bad and falling down as she walked.  My wife asked if her dog can be cured.  The lights then began to blink a lot. After 15 minutes of observing and communicating with this object, she started to yell for me to come downstairs.  I ignored her cause it was Saturday morning and I did not sleep well the night before and wanted to sleep.  After 5 minutes of her yelling she came up and finally told me what she had seen.  I first went to the bathroom and then downstairs.  I was very skeptical. When I got downstairs, we did not see the orb but a small cylinder shaped object which I am calling a Plasma Cylinder. The object did not appear to have edges but seemed like a fluid object with constant movement inside and on the edges of the object.  Inside were multi-colored lights similar to plasma.  Each color was not unique and separate like a rainbow but more meshed like colored water and the water colors are constantly mixing.  It seemed to be full of energy with colors floating stationary in the air.  The plasma object appeared to be about 1 ft in length and 6” in height.  It was about 5 feet off the ground near the same corner wall that the orb was previously seen.  The object then went directly through our wall to go outside.  I only saw the “Plasma Cylinder” object for about 2 minutes before it disappeared through our wall. Attach is a picture of the ¾ domed orb and the Plasma Cylinder.  We are also attaching a picture of our corner wall.  Please note that the orb/plasma object appeared between the left wall and the flower picture. Our corner wall is on the Western corner of our house.  At 7 am that corner is dark because light does not enter that corner.  We have also closed drapes on the Western window as well and that part was dark because the sun was just rising on the east side.  We know what we saw and it was not an illusion. Also, note that we were going to put our dog to sleep in a few days before this incident--  she could barely move and was walking sideways and constantly falling down.  After the orb left, our dog did not appear to have any symptoms of the stroke--  she was walking perfectly fine.  She is still sick but she now walks fine.  We were freaked out by this.  Many of our friends saw the difference in her walk and we told them what had happened.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

Slow descending object in shape of pyramid burst into approx 8 different lights which stayed in place for 1 minute, then moved away.;2015-02-12 06:00:00;3 minutes;Slow descending object in shape of pyramid burst into approx 8 different lights which stayed in place for 1 minute, then moved away. Initially, thought objects were parachuting down, because object was slow desending. Object had two glowing engines underneath which made desending slower than something parachuting.  The object changed form several times which made me think it was a parachute, but the final form was a pyramid with the two glowing engines underneath.   After watching this for approximately 1 minute, it burst into approximately 8 different lights which were in a cluster.  They lights stayed stationary for about 1 minute.   I went to grab phone to take picture flash interfered with picture, then second picture didn't reveal image.   At that time the 8 lights moved away south and out of view.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
