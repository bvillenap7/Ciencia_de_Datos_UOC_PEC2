Bright Blue/Greenish  White flash in the Eastern sky falling to the SE;2003-12-03 19:43:00;3 seconds;Bright Blue/Greenish  White flash in the Eastern sky falling to the SE While walking my dog after dark, I witnessed a bright flash falling toward the earth. The flash appeared in the Eastern sky, approximately 80 deg above the horizon. It was bright white with a blue/green component to it. It appeared to be falling to the SE. I witnessed the flash umtil it dis-appeared behind a nearby tree top. At first I thought it was a meteorite, but then I realised that it was rather large/close and between me and the clouds. The weather was windy and cool with partly to mostly cloudy skies. There was no sound that I could hear associated with the flash.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
Bright white object .;2007-01-09 18:34:00;2 minutes;Bright white object . 6:34 p.m. - January 9, 2007 - No clouds, no planes, no sounds.  North sky going west to east.  Light traveling at slow speed for the first 30 seconds, very dim.  Light became very bright for 2 seconds then dimmed to almost nothing.  Followed the very dim light for another minute which suddenly sped up, grew extremely bright and glowing white, then grew dim once more.  Was only able to follow for this dim light for another few seconds.  Approximately 2 minutes later, a fighter plane coming from the south, flew to the west, in the exact direction of the unknown object.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
Frequent lights in the sky sightings in Miami Florida;2008-01-08 07:30:00;5 minutes;Frequent lights in the sky sightings in Miami Florida To whom it may concern at NUFORC  I would like to report sightings in the Miami FL. Area from the last week of December 2007 through just recently as yesterday January 27, 2008. This the first time I actually had the guts to talk to someone besides my family about it. The first time me and my friend saw a bright steady light in the night sky we kind of freaked out sense we first thought it was a plain flying higher than usual but then it disappeared right in front of our eyes, we had our doubts, and a bit skeptical but intrigued at what we saw! On the first two weeks between the 6 and 8  of January 2008, we saw the many flashing lights not in a formation like military jets, besides the speed, the way they flashed, and making no noise what so ever. It didn’t look like it was one object because after the first sighting of lights, later on that same day, we saw two more similar flashing lights on the same flight pattern. The lights were headed northeast on the right side of the constellation. Then after we saw those sets of flashing lights. My wife starring at Orion’s belt for some reason, she noticed a reddish round shaped dimming light at a very high altitude moving slowly between Orion’s belt and the a yellow bright star or planet in the night sky. I felt amazed and something made me keep a closer watch sense then. On the 23 of January, my brother and I were talking about the lights and I was hoping that he might have the chance to see something and at about 7:30 PM, he and his wife saw two pairs of flashing lights Identical to what me and my wife saw before. He pointed out that what was very weird was the way the lights flashed, he said they didn’t look like anything he had seen before in his life! And just recently as the 27 of January, my family and I saw a bright light that appeared from no where and traveled right in front of us a very high altitude but close enough for us to see that it was no commercial plain nor did it make a sound! After 10- 15 minutes it just faded into the night and vanished. We were hoping to see it light up ! again, b ut it never did! So now after all these lights in the sky you can say, “I definitely got me wondering why have there been so many sightings all of the sudden, in Arizona and Mexico recently and now Miami? It is difficult to  believe it and say, “Ah forget it it’s a military plain or something man made! I got so many questions, such as if and when I see un-identifying lights again in the night sky”! What to do? 	Do I take a pictures, or film it? 	Do I call the Airport and ask if they know what it is? “Will they tell me if it ain’t a plain? I don’t think so”! 	Do I call the news stations? And without a picture or footage, will they take me seriously, and will they report my call?  Listen I know I’m not crazy, cause I wasn’t the only one that saw them and couldn’t identify what they were, so… I have an XL2 Cannon Digital Camera and believe me, it is fully charged and ready to get footage of these lights in the sky as soon as they come way!!! Thank You…;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
silver/goldish color shiny object in the air;2009-03-09 07:50:00;30 seconds;silver/goldish color shiny object in the air Silver shiny object in the air. My husband and I were driving down SW 8th Street and 16th Avenue at 7:50 AM. I looked up and saw a shiny object floating in the air which resembled the reflection of a mirror when the sun hits it. I asked my husband to look at it as well and he also saw the same thing. The object would reflect a shining light on and off but not in a particular pattern. Since the object was at a distance, the size looked as big as my thumb. When the object was not shining like the flare from a mirror, the color of the object was like a dark brown. Also the object stayed floating in one place, it did not move. Then it disappeared in matter of seconds.  It was sort of like, I blinked, and it was not there any more. This whole incident lasted approximately less than 1 minute.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
At 9:21 pm E.S.T. the entire south eastern sky lit up with a bright green flash, twice in a one minute period about 30 seconds apart.;2011-01-27 21:21:00;1 second;At 9:21 pm E.S.T. the entire south eastern sky lit up with a bright green flash, twice in a one minute period about 30 seconds apart.  The sky conditions were mostly cloudy, and the flash could have been caused by lightning, but the weather radar showed no such weather conditions.  The green flash may have been the result of an exploding electrical transformer, but the lights did not flicker.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

At approximately 12:25 AM on January 1, 2012, in El Portal (North Miami), FL, I looked up at the clear, western sky and saw a flotilla of approximately a dozen or more bright, red, flashing lights in a rectangular formation (meaning the lights were dispersed equal distantly and in the shape of a rectangle) heading north.  This only lasted a very brief period of time (60 seconds) , as they were traveling extremely fast.  A  person accompanying me also witnessed this sighting.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

Thick flash of light with red tip/outline squiggling across Miami sky;2014-07-24 00:34:00;2 seconds;Thick flash of light with red tip/outline squiggling across Miami sky. I was pointing out a dog/gazelle shaped cloud to my friend though the sky was pretty clear, and about 2 seconds after he turns his head to look-a large thick flash of light with red at the tip (and kind of as an outline) flashed across the sky.   It came out of nowhere and randomly squiggled in the sky before jetting off in one direction to the left.  It was completely random and sudden.  Unexpected and completely without noise.   My friend and I just stared at each other bewildered as we confirmed that we both had seen the same thing.  We talked about what it could possibly be but could not come up with anything we had ever seen before.  It was most definitely not a plane, weather balloon, helicopter, drone, or falling star.
