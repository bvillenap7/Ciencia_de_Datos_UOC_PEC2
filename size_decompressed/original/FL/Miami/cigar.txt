Close Encounter with a large cigar shaped UFO.;1974-08-15 20:30:00;5 Mins.;Close Encounter with a large cigar shaped UFO. I was driving westward on Coral Way (sw 24th St.), when at about 87th Ave. I noticed several bright lights in the horizon.  At that point I thought they were aircraft and joked with my little sister and cousin about them being UFO'S.  As we got closer I coud tell that they weren't aircraft but looked more like the stadium lights at FIU (Florida Int'l University). But as we approached the intersection at 107 Ave., I realized that stadium lights were much farther.  When we finally gor to the intersection, I stopped my car, got off and directly above me was this huge bright and white cigar shaped light.  It didn't make any noise whatsoever.  Suddenly, a small green light started blinking and it silently began to descend as it drew away from us.  In ended up hovering above some bushes about a block away.  To make a long story short, after almost crashing trying to get close to the UFO again, I decided to drop the chase since by then my little sister and cousin were very scared.  A couple of days later I heard on the radio that there had been other reports of UFO sightings in the area. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD));25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

The object in the sky was not identifiable or familiar to me at all.;2000-07-15 01:00:00;5 seconds;The object in the sky was not identifiable or familiar to me at all. We were parking late night at a club, and my husband was getting out of the car while i waited outside with the parking attendant which was a young kid maybe 18-19 years old, we were standing there next to the parked car when an flying object came by fairly close in the sky just hovered for a second and it was gone it had bright flashing lights and it made no sound. This  was enough for the attendant and I to actually look at each other and confusingly ask each other what, was that? obviously if it was an identifyable object we wouldn't have questioned it, but we were honestly puzzled to what we had just seen which came and went very fast and with no sound only bright flashing lights.

Orange color UFO's over Miami Sat.night.{05/14/2011};2011-05-14 22:00:00;2 minutes;Orange color UFO's over Miami Sat.night.{05/14/2011} I step outside and looked up towards the north around 10 pm.  Immidiatelly I notice what it seemed I line of orange lights traveling at a slow speed and almost steady and a very high altitude,so it seemed to me.It lasted maybe for about one minute and then disappeared.  Since I live very close to MIA, I noticed air traffic was diverted towards the south.  Also I heard sounds like a interceptor in the vicinity,I live very close to Homestead Air Force Base.  As a final comment it was the same type of orange color as the ones we saw on the night of 12/31/2010, but this New Years Eve sighting was of various UFO and every 8 minutes interval.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
Big, bright, long light that shined bright for about 1 second.;2012-12-10 22:45:00;1 second;Big, bright, long light that shined bright for about 1 second. I was looking out of my balcony and straight in front of me I saw a bright, long, light that shined for about 1 second. It was too bright and too big to be a plane.  It lit the sky and it went out.  I would say it was over North Miami.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
