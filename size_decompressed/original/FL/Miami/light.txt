multi-colored swirling illuminating lights (looked like a tornado in the sky)  500 Lights On Object0: Yes;1969-07-07 23:30:00;hour;multi-colored swirling illuminating lights (looked like a tornado in the sky)   The incident that happened to me was in 1969, Dade county Florida.  I was four years old. I don’t know why I remember this but I do. It was at night and my family and I was doing what families do watch television. Suddenly, the lights went out and I guess there was a noise or something outside because we all headed out of the house. There was something in the sky swirling around with illuminated lights which were multi-colored lights. It (the object) had no form.  After looking at it for, what I can’t remember, a while the air around me felt thick, as if I were under water because I felt like I was moving in slow motion. I also remember my uncle standing in front of me but not moving or speaking. It seemed as though he was frozen in time I kept pulling at his shirt trying to get his attention but he didn’t move.  The next thing I remember is touching some kind of machine with lights all around it and it was very cold. From what I can gather now thinking back it seemed to me to be a probe of some kind. Now, the funny thing about this whole thing is I thought that I was dreaming, except for this one thing, I wasn’t. I say that because years later when speaking to a few of my family members we all had the same experience. They remembered exactly what I did and perhaps a little more. So, I wanted to report this incident in case someone else has seen the illuminated swirling unidentified object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

Five bright, round, white lights in formation were seen, three together and two together, but then they suddenly disappeared.;1978-06-30 22:00:00;5 minutes;Five bright, round, white lights in formation were seen, three together and two together, but then they suddenly disappeared. I was sitting on a boat in the middle of a small lake at night, with the boat light off, and my boyfriend and I  noticed five round white lights high up in the nighttime sky.  They were in formation---three together, and two together.   They seemed to be stationery, but could have been moving (they were very high).   We watched for a few minutes, amazed, then turned the light on in the boat.  Suddenly, two disappeared... then the other three!  It seemed as though they had noticed that we were there, watching them, and decided to take  off.   But they didn't seem to fly off----the  round lights just totally disappeared.    This account is my best recollection.   I was in my late teens, I believe.  We were not under the influence of any alcohol or drugs.   I am sorry--I do not know the exact year, or time of night (I only approximated.) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
Sighting near turkey point nuclear power plant Miami, Fl.;1987-06-01 06:00:00;20 min;Sighting near turkey point nuclear power plant Miami, Fl. In miami Florida about 20 years ago. I was outside, I looked up in the sky due south and saw a light illuminating the sky. The light was soo bright it lit up the early evening sky. It moved in a odd and swift way. Many years later I realized that due south from where I was about 5 miles west from the coast is 'turkey point' which is a nuclear power plant. I wonder to this day if the power plant had anything to do with the sighting. I was with my mother and cousin and it lasted for a good 20 minutes.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
They disappeared behind the only cloud in the sky.;1988-10-25 05:00:00;1 minute;They disappeared behind the only cloud in the sky. My wife and I in our balcony terrace. She was 22 and I was 31. Around five in the morning. The sky was clear. No clouds except only one small dark cloud in the center of the sky. Then appear 3 lights in our vision focus (I mean behind buildings)... from west to east, with erratic movement. They were not airplanes. No sound. Very fast pace and erratic up and down movements. Two of the lights were rounded and the third light was like a cigarette. The three light were yellow. The rare thing was the three went behind the only cloud in the sky and then disappeared. I mean, the lights did not go out from that cloud. We stand there for about 3o more minutes to see if the lights go out but the lights never go out from that cloud in the center of the sky.

UFO checked us out  on the water at night while cruising to Miami, Oct 1992;1992-10-15 21:00:00;30 minutes;UFO checked us out  on the water at night while cruising to Miami, Oct 1992 My husband and I were returning home on our 28' boat from a trip to the florida keys.  We had just past Elliot Key at about sunset and were heading north to Miami.  We were just cruising at a slow pace past the inlet before Key Biscaine when my husband said, What is that light following us?  It was very dark at this point and I looked way up and back and saw a light above us.  It was a strange light as it didn't have any glare and didn't seem to be connected to anything.  There was no noise as from a ship or a plane or helicopter.  The light just kept getting closer and closer and bigger and bigger.  I could look straight into it without any it hurting my eyes.  The whole boat was engulfed in light as it came right up on us.  My husband kept getting quite excited and screaming, What is it? See if you can make anything out.  I thought I could see an outline of something, but there was no noise as if a craft were approaching.  No red or green lights, no propeller sounds...nothing. Just the sound of our boat cruising and my husband screaming.  I said, Just hit it, just get out of here!!  I was afraid a large ship was upon us or something.   My husband hit the throttle and I braced myself for the thrust of the boat.  As I did this, the light flew up into the sky as fast as lightning and we could see it moving into the galaxy farther and farther away.   We have told few people about this incident as we don't want to look like nuts.  But we both know for sure that a UFO was checking us out.  We went back the next day to see where we were exactly--we found a marker we passed along the way--there is nothing out there...nothing.

Arizona lights...over Miami?;1995-06-15 21:00:00;10 - 15 Min.;Arizona lights...over Miami? Although I am very unsure on the dates, I felt compelled to file this report because I know, along with the people who witnessed this with me, that we saw something unexplained. On a summer night in 1995 or 1996 I was outside of my house (parents' house) along with some friends of mine as we did often. At about 9 PM (2100) I jumped up on a transformer box that was outside of many of the homes in that area. From that vantage point, I was able to look over the roof of my house and at that particular time I was looking to the south. Many miles away I could see what were 6 -7 lights yellow in appearance. The lights were in somewhat of a pattern in that they were one behind the other. Miami International Airport is South-South West of were we lived then so my first thoughts were that they were aircraft. After a few minutes I realized that wasn't possible because not only were they too close to each other, but they were standing still. As I continued to look I called over my friends to ask them what they thought that could be, they had no idea. As we watched some lights would disappear, and appear again only many miles forward (or ahead) of the first lights. Then some others would disappear, and reappear in the same locations. It was the first and only time I saw something that I could not explain in the sky. Years later I saw those same exact lights on television, they were calling them the Arizona lights. I have since learned that Homestead Air Base is also south of us, however I cannot confirm any operations because it was just too long ago, and I have no exact dates. I have seen flares launched from aircraft before, but I cannot say that they were what I saw that night. I am now a private pilot, and can confirm that there was nothing usual about what we saw.

I was standing outside waiting for guests and lookin at the sky.  It was a cool night and the stars were visible in larger numbers. I noticed a light go at a pretty fast speed accross the night sky.  It moved much faster then a commercial aircraft and seemed to be at a high altitude.  It could not have been a military jet because they do not fly with lights on.  it was one light colored white with a small tint of yellow.  It raced accross the sky and fle away into an invisible distance. It flew straight from North to South.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
a beam of light came out from this super light.;1997-03-15 18:00:00;4minutes;a beam of light came out from this super light. I was looking at plain airplanes pass with my baby. She love to see them fly over our heads. To make the story short... One of them came and suddenly it stop. Wow I thought it must be a helicopter but it made no noise. There were no red beams or any other light which regular aircraft use. it was a plain circle light. It stop there for four or more minutes. I know other planes saw it because I could see the other airplanes pass in their normal path. This one was as bright as the light of a full moon. I have never seen that light here on earth. Then a beam of light came out from this light ... a conifer light like a triangular cone. it was aiming at a cloud. It turn 360 degrees and its beam intensify. It was looking for something. Then it turn off its beam and the light was so strong the cloud look like a neon toy when you turn the lights off. (glow in the dark)  it stayed there 30 seconds or so. It moved closer to us, then it move really fast like a shooting star to another place but it was still the same size. it hover a little (stayed put) Then it blasted into space and shrink right before our eyes and I lost it when I finally blinked my eyes. That my friends was the spacecraft (light) i saw. I did not see green men or machines it was pure light and pure energy. Its the first time i tell this to people besides my family. GOD is my witness I am telling the truth. There is life out there. I was lucky to be a witness to this. .... May you be as lucky as I was.

As I walked into the backyard of my house in Miami, I noticed a sort of amber /white light moving in the sky.;1998-01-27 21:23:00;20 sec.;Summary : As I walked into the backyard of my house in Miami, I noticed a sort of amber /white light moving in the sky. During the President's State of the Union address, My dog asked me to let him into the backyard so he could do his thing. As I walked into the backyard, I noticed an odd looking light in the Western sky. The light was amber/white in color, and was not blinking. It was located approximately 35-40 degrees above the horizon, and moving in a Southerly direction. I watched the object traverse the sky from due West to approximately W/SW. I was watching the light pretty intensely, and all of a sudden, it vanished. The color of the light reminded me of the color and quality of a vapor street lamp. You know, the kind that is supposed to reduce shadows. It appeared to be moving fairly fast. I have seen many airliners flying in the skies around here, and the object appeared to be moving faster than they normally do. It appeared to be out over the Everglades.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

It was in one of those very quiet neighborhoods and i could even hear the crickets. I was looking at the moon through the sunroof top of the car and all of a sudden a light appeared out of nowhere.It looked just like a regular star, but it was moving so i knew it wasnt a star. I kept following it, and it kept making these sharp curves, going slowly then fast and vice versa. But then as it was going away from the moon it started dimming out and finally disappeared. It didnt come back until a half hour later, and it was all the way on the other side of the sky. It did the same movements, dimmed out and disappeared once again. That was the last i saw of it.

I told him maybe it was his imagination until  03/10/03, when I was out back with the dogs and I was looking up and all of a sudden, I saw the same thing.  It completely caught me off guard.  It happened so fast that I didn't have time to call my husband. On approximately 10/04/03 my husband saw a bright white light that moved from east to west and disappeared.  The speed it was going was not a plane, nor was it a falling star.  On  10/15/03 my husband was outside and yelled for me to come out, so I ran out and he saw a light traveling so quickly coming from the south to north.  All of a sudden it stopped, became very bright and went upward and disappeared.  With all of these events, there were no noises and happened within seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

These white lights really caught my attention, the weather clear with and with good visibility. They appeared to be very close, maybe at about an altitude of 10,000 feet. They did not move for about 2 or 3 minutes then one of the white lights started moving, breaking the formation and making a straight line formation. Then suddenly I saw several other smaller lights (star-like) appearing in the sky and moving towards these 3 big white bright lights, some were steady and others were traveling at fast speed. I was able to count at least 25 of them, but I saw more appearing from the north east, it looked like it was an invasion. I’m a private pilot and I’m 100% sure that it was not an plane nor an air show. I have never seen anything like that before because of the way they were moving,  and clearly it couldn’t have been a plane because there were no red or green blinking lights. Whatever it was it seemed as if they were observing us. After a while about 10 to 15 minutes later they all starting moving and dispersing from the sky my friend was trying to take pictures with her camera phone but the resolution was very poor. I later went back to our office and I tried to contact the FAA to report it, but I was not able to get in touch with them, I called the 24 Hour Safety Hotline at 800-255-1111 and all I got was a recording but I never left a message about this incident. I hope this report is helpful to you, and should you find something relating to our sighting please let us know.  Kind regards, Mauricio Diaz;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
Beams of Light;2007-02-06 23:30:00;30 minutes;I was outside walking the dog around 11:30 PM.  Much of the night sky was overcast with clouds.   Two beams of light were dancing behind the clouds.  At first I dismissed it thinking they might be reflectors, but after a few minutes the lights had moved from way in front of me to over me.  I leaned again my car to take a good look and the two lights turned into five.  They moved all over the sky in circles and some times chased each other. I went in to call my two daughters and we watched the lights for 15 minutes, but still cannot explain what we saw.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

Approximately 9:05 p.m. we were observing the sky in the northwest, towards Miami International Airport and had noticed no planes had taken off.  A bright white light appeared and moved from the northwest to the southeast.  There was a haziness around the white light. It first moved very slowly and very bright.  As it moved closer it went farther up.  As it continued heading toward the south east, the bright white light began to dim as it went higher up, the glow changed from white to bright red.  It then disappeared for and one could not find it, but then, it appeared again, but very dim, barely visible, continuing southeast.  The movement was zig zag, there was no noise.  No planes were in the vicinity at the time.  It is a cloudless, clear night.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

Green Trail left my Fast Moving Ship over Miami;2009-09-06 01:00:00;15 seconds;Green Trail left my Fast Moving Ship over Miami During the very early morning of Sunday, September 06, 2009, a friend and I were sitting looking at downtown Miami.  It was a very clear night, few clouds in the sky.  I was looking Southwest when I noticed a sudden burst of green light accompanied by movement coming down quickly in an arc motion, leaving a brief fluorescent green trail in its wake, then after dropping to its lowest point it suddenly leveled off, taking a direct western path and quickly was gone out of sight. The “trail” was very brief and was similar to that of someone using a laser in a dark room, where the trails “linger” behind the motion to the human eye. My friend was not looking in the same direction, however he caught the “burst” out of the corner of his eye and turned around wondering what it was as well. I have watched the skies over Miami for several years in the same location and this is the first time I have seen anything which appeared as reported. The object was too far away to visually identify in any other way.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

Two star-sized blinking lights moving fast and perpendicular in a northwesterly direction;2010-11-17 20:15:00;5 minutes;Two star-sized blinking lights moving fast and perpendicular in a northwesterly direction Two vividly and simultaneously blinking yellowish-white lights slightly larger than an average star flying perpendicular to each other across the sky, heading in a North-North-West direction which appeared to fly directly overhead from the southeastern horizon.  The objects appeared artificial and seemed to be flying above the atmosphere (it was a pretty clear night). One would assume they were satellites except GPS and telecom satellites do not move in either a west or northern direction.  Nor do I believe they blink.  They were also clearly not recognizable (Earth)aircraft, military or otherwise.  There were several commercial aircraft present in the vicinity making a landing and taking off from nearby Miami International and Tamiami Airports with which to compare at a glance. We were walking due-West on SW 68th Street approaching SW 75th Avenue.  There is moderate oak and fruit-bearing tree foliage and the homes in the area all have a minimum of a 1-acre ! lot.  There was only one public streetlamp lit at the time and all the nearby homes had their outside lights off.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

Beams of Energy & Illuminated Particles, Rapidly Moving Clusters of Stars;2010-12-03 23:00:00;3 days;Beams of Energy & Illuminated Particles, Rapidly Moving Clusters of Stars After 10 years of serious sky watching, I noticed the beams of faint light or illuminated particles for the first time on 12/3  from a 10th story apt in Miami. I had a clear, wide angle view of the entire horizon, north, west and south. At first I couldn't believe my eyes and then I thought it must be the rumored Project Blue Beam or a new and improved night time HAARP/Chemtrail program. Maybe a phenomenon like the recent one in Lu Shan, China, supposedly created by the city lights, and the atmosphere? So, when I returned to my ground level home, 30 miles north I looked into the clear sky,  I saw the same grids of energy beams and faint pinpoints of light that appeared to move rapidly at certain intersections where the suspended particles met.   The next day, at high noon, I went to an open field nearby, stood in the shade and voila! The sky was perfectly clear and blue, except for the thin veil of grey particles, suspended by waves of energy in a perfect grid pattern,rolling across the sky. Planes preparing to land at Fort Lauderdale airport appeared to be flying above the particle grid, so it could not have been more than a few thousand feet from the ground. These beams were visible to me for 3 nights and! 1 day and a freind who lives 5 miles west.  Last night, they became barely visible and today I see no particles or beams in the daytime sky.  Unfortunately, the beams are so faint during the day and night, I can't imagine you will see any photo evidence soon.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

Red lights flying over Miami, Florida, December 3rd 2012.;2012-12-03 02:30:00;3 minutes;Red lights flying over Miami, Florida, December 3rd 2012 On December 3rd, 2012, at approximately 2:30am, I was driving south on Miami's 826/Palmetto expressway. I had left my best friend's house after watching a movie. While on the highway I noticed maybe 10-13 red lights in the night sky. Because my car was dustier than usual due to local construction, I had to roll down my driver's window to get a clearer view.  The red lights seemed so out of place I decided to stop the car and parked it on the emergency lane. They were fairly low, close to the western horizon and they were slowly moving due south.  They were spread out but maintained their places, all appearing to move at the same speed. They reminded me of aircraft in formation but the pattern was irregular, rather like a constellation's shape.  They were essentially red lights, and were only slightly larger than any star in the sky and they seemed to twinkle softly as stars do.  Because I didn't have a great camera on me, I called my best friend on my cell phone! and told him to run out and look west.  But as he was getting out of his apartment, they all began to fade slowly and one after another until they disappeared entirely. As an artist, I consider myself an extremely open-minded person. But I try to approach such situations with a rational mind.  I have never before seen anything like this in person.  I am also sure there must have been several people who witnessed this.  The lights covered at least a sixth of the night sky. While there wasn't a great deal of traffic at 2:30am, the city wasn't entirely asleep either.  Anyone driving due west on several roads would have seen these lights gliding overhead.  I don't drink nor do I take any hallucinogenic drugs and I was wide awake when I witnessed this. As soon as I got home, I immediately went online to see if there was any news of a meteor shower or maybe a satellite burning up and found nothing. I did find an article on a British news site of what is &quotbelieved to be&quot a recent meteor shower.  But the pictures show a phenomenon that looks entirely different.  I then googled pictures of meteors and similar events and again, completely different images came up. When finally going on youtube at about 3:30am, I searched for the terms &quotred+lights+sky&quot and found a few videos showing lights over Galveston and Farmingdale and finally found a match for what I saw!  While mysteries make life more exciting, explanations can be more comforting. I would very much like an answer to this one. It was beautiful but slightly unsettling.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

At first I thought the lights were fireworks but then realized the lights were slowly flying at a low rate of speed from east to west over the Kendall area.   I know they were not jet powered or turbine powered aircraft because they were definitely going under 100 mph.   They could be helicopters or airplanes but I don't see why there would be over 10 aircraft with red lights flying extremely close to each other.

Orange orbs.  ((NUFORC Note:  Later reported to have been a launch of Chinese lanterns.  PD));2014-11-27 20:35:00;5 minutes;Orange Orbs After Thanksgiving dinner, my parents walked me out to my truck.  We were talking outside when we noticed an orange orb fly above us.  We stared at it because it looked like nothing we have ever seen before.  It flew from the north to the south until it disappeared into the night horizon.  We were puzzled because it definitely was not a helicopter, or a plane.   Immediately after it disappeared, and during our discussion of what it could be, another orange orb originated from the same place.  We watched the first one come from and it took the same exact flight route immediately above us.   For this orb I quickly reached for my cell phone and began snapping away pictures (I will follow up with an email including all pictures I took).   Again, as soon as the 2nd orb disappeared, the 3rd orange orb began its trip.  It also took the same route as the first two orbs and disappeared into the night's horizon.  I also took a few pictures of the 3rd orb.  My parents and I s! tayed for a few minutes outside searching the sky for more, but did not see any more. Curiously enough, the pictures do not all reflect what we saw with the naked eye.  Also note that some of the pictures I tried using the zoom feature.  And lastly, the orbs made absolutely no noise as they passed directly above us. The other two witnesses were my retired parents.  I happened to have my cat on a leash with us, but he did not see it nor did he act unusual. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Addendum to Miami 11/27/14 10:35 pm Event-- NO LONGER A UFO.

This one however was the only red one and was blinking on and off quickly.   At first I would have disregarded it as a satellite or a plane however what caught my eye was the trail or perhaps tails attached to the object.  Behind it I could see two trails much like that of an airplane which were curved.  The trails however were like nothing I have ever seen before.  I will do my best to describe it but it is difficult without a physical drawing.   Behind the dot two curved lines making it look like a semicircle was forming behind the craft.

Large star-shaped object moving north across the Miami sky.;2015-11-06 05:25:00;10 minutes;Large star shaped object moving north across the Miami sky. This morning at around 5:25 a.m., I went outside to my front yard to walk my little dog.  As I walked out from my porch, I looked up at the sky as there was a clear spot with huge stars.  I looked over to the East to look at the Moon, when one of the stars in that cluster to the west caught my eye, it started moving, silently.   I quickly looked back and was astounded to see that one of the huge stars on the perimeter of the little formation started moving north slowly, and deliberately, across the sky.  It was not twinkling or changing colors, just a huge ball of light that looked exactly like a star. I stood there in wonder and continued to watch it.  After a few minutes it got closer to what looked like a tiny star and they twinkled at each other as the big one passed the little one.  This was just astounding!  I continued to watch the big star travel across the sky until it disappeared behind a large, fluffy cloud. I wanted to go inside and get my husband, but I knew if I turned away it would be gone. I have seen UFO's before, and one time in 2009 we had a shared family sighting of a large triangle craft in Fort Lauderdale, but I have never reported anything before.   I also had a strange experience about a month ago while working in Texas, I woke up with a strange triangle mark made of lines on my hand.  I do have a very clear picture of this mark. I would love to talk to an investigator, as I have a lot of contact with UFO's and other paranormal experiences. Thank you very much for your time.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

It was by Krome Avenue and in the Everglades area like 20 miles before reaching Mikosukkee Indian Resort southbound.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
Red light seen flying and hovering over neighborhood then light went off and oval/disc shaped object seen flying away.;2018-01-01 00:20:00;1 minute;Red light seen flying and hovering over neighborhood then light went off and oval/disc shaped object seen flying away. On January 1st 2018 between the time of 12:15-12:30 am. While walking to my cousins house, returning from watching fireworks from the Belle Meade area of Biscayne Bay in Miami Florida. I was walking West on NE 72nd Street when I noticed a very bright red/orange light coming from the NW direction. The object from the best I could tell was far away across Biscayne Boulevard over another neighborhood. When it got directly in front of me, still far away it stopped and hovered in one spot for several seconds. I could not hear if it made any sound and it was still very, very bright red. I thought it was a helicopter but it made no noise and didn't have search lights. The light/s shut off on the object and it flew South in a straight line. I could still see it and tracked it for a few seconds before it was out of site. It looked gray and was oval/disc shaped. I told my wife what I was seeing right when the lights went out, so she nor any of the others in our group ! witnessed it. The entire event was took place in less than 30 seconds.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
UFO LIGHTS, (ORBS) above Miami sky.;2018-02-15 05:00:00;1-2 minutes;UFO LIGHTS, (ORBS) above Miami sky To whom it may concern: We deliver food for schools (frozen food) and like any morning we arrived little earlier then the schools opens.  While I was looking through the paperwork my driver starts screening at me if he is seeing things, he asked me if I saw the same lights as he was.  I look up and sure enough there they are.  About 10 of them in perfect line formation equal distance apart.  I wasn’t sure what was it we were looking at but I told him yes I sure do see them.  As soon as I said that these lights that were just hovering in the air rose about 20% straight up (all together) then they stopped, and then, they became instant circle like number 0 in the air. At this point maybe 40+ seconds have passed and I jumped out of the truck grabbed my phone and started recording.  I have 48 seconds of the footage of what we saw afterwards and would love to share it with you. Some people speculate drones or paratroopers but we checked and there were no paratroopers anywhere near and it’s hard for me to believe it was drones as their moves define laws of physics.  I would love to share the video with you it’s incredable and 100% original and what we saw.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

During my nightly ritual of looking up stars with an app called Star Walk I noticed 2 very odd lights, very high up, apprx 50k-75k ft.;2018-12-19 21:00:00;15 minutes;During my nightly ritual of looking up stars with an app called Star Walk I noticed 2 very odd lights, very high up, apprx 50k-75k ft.  I can guess this because I live a few miles south and east of Miami International, there are planes landing and taking off all the time and I was able to get a plane at flying altitude as a comparison.  Using the Star Chart app I confirmed it was not Cassiopedia and no other visible stars were at this location.  Two lights.. One bright white with another just beside it slowing drifting due east..  Watched with my dad as they very very slowly moved east until they were gone.  Not very dramatic but I am certain they weren't planes..  Definitely not stars..  With all the light polution in Miami they were incredibly bright and any planets and stars would have definitely shown up on the star chart.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
@ brilliant light beams traveling across western sky at high rate of speed in Miami, Florida.;2019-04-29 19:50:00;15 minutes;@ brilliant light beams traveling across western sky at high rate of speed in Miami, Florida. 2 brilliant streaks of light in the western horizon, directly west of Miami International Airport.  One streak was traveling horizontal from North to South at a high rate of speed, and disappeared after about 15 minutes into a dark cloud.  The other brilliant light was traveling from up to down, and also disappeared into a dark cloud.  Both light beams were moving at high speed and were visible for 15 minutes at sundown.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
16 lights moving in the southeast direction and then went up.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-06 22:00:00;5 minutes;16 lights moving in the southeast direction and then went up I was sitting outside with my wife after dinner as we almost always do and out of the northwest we saw tiny lights that looked like stars moving pretty quickly in the southeast direction.  We saw them move in the southeast direction but then they would go straight up after a few seconds of moving and disappear.  One by one they did the same trajectory with maybe 5 or 6 seconds in between each one.  After about the 10th object I called out my children and mother in law and they saw the final 5.  In total we counted 16 lights. The lights were white and really faint like stars . I'm always looking up to the sky and believe we are not alone.  My wife and I shot some video on our phones but you can hardly see them. My children are minors and my mother in law is of retirement age.  This isn't the first time we see them moving across the sky but it is the first time we saw so many going in the same trajectory.  They were too high and fast to be drones.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
We witnessed what at first we thought was a satilite moving  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-06 22:00:00;:15;Tonight May 6th at approx 10pm. My wife and I were sitting outside in the backyard facing west. Venus was bright and low on the horizon. We witnessed what at first we thought was a satilite moving from about 2 o’clock from Venus to 11 o’clock then it seemed to fade away. It didn’t have any flashing or blinking lights. It looked like a dim star moving a at a constant speed.  We saw 10 to 12 more lights appear and fade away along the same path in the sky one right after the other in a straight line. At one point I saw four lights and as the top most light faded away a new one would appear. So I would put these lights starting north of Venus and higher in the sky then moving diagonally upward and to the south, then fading close to the top stars of the Gemini constellation. I know they weren’t planes, again way to high up and no strobes. I thought it was a satillite but then there were so many one right after the other. Anyway this is what I saw.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
