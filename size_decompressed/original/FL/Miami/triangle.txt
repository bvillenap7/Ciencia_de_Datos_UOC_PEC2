Later reported on Art Bell in '98.  This thing was huge!!! Hovered over downtown Miami on a hot summer day at 3:00pm in the afternoon.  I was returning from Miami Beach on the I-195 past Dodge Island/Government cut ... saw this huge thing hovering about 2000 feet over downtown ... I remember saying, Yeah, this will shake them up.

Certain things happen to you in your life that you never forget and this is why you know they are real the rest of your life.;1980-07-15 06:00:00;a minute or two;Certain things happen to you in your life that you never forget and this is why you know they are real the rest of your life. I'm now 47 years old and successful in the Exporting of wastepaper to China, India, etc.   When I was twenty years old I lived in Miami on Collins Avenue facing the Atlantic Ocean from the 17th floor of my Grandmother's apartment.  I had the apartment to myself for the entire summer and it was time well spent.  I loved the beach, the girls, etc. I have ALWAYS been a morning person and remain so to this day.  I've never needed an alarm clock and rise most mornings before 5am.  I've never been into alcohol or drugs of any kind.  In fact I love my lucidity and enjoy my conscious life.   I was wide awake that morning and could not wait to step out onto the terrace to look out over the entire Atlantic Ocean and feel the sweet breeze of freedom that was my youth.  I was smart enough to know how young and free I was because I knew one day I would be who I am today and how hard it is to make a living and meet one's responsibilities.  As the Sun was rose to light the morning sky. a speeding craft came from way out in the ocean.   I knew instantly this was something not of our experience.  This triangular object did in fact stop at the shoreline and hovered about 75 feet above my vantage point from the 17th floor terrace.  There were bright lights on each point of the triangle and it just hovered there for what seemed forever.  It hummed just enough that I could hear it over the sound of the waves beneath us.   I was not afraid but felt glued to my fixed position as I gripped the rail of my Grandmother's balcony. What happened next remains forever in my head all these years because the craft turned on its right (my left) and sped off at such tremendous velocity and made a sound like a team of muffled Lions roaring in unison.  There was a faint liquid vapor trail and I could follow the craft with my eyes for the length of the coast until it then ascended into the clouds with a speed I can not comprehend or convey here.  This thing zipped away like nobody's business.  I never forgot it all these years. ! I'm fam iliar with Harrier Jump Jets and even witnessed Israeli fighter pilots doing manuevers over the Negev Desert when I lived in Israel.  I've seen them turn on a dime during arial dogfighting manuevers.  I was even buzzed by Israeli warplanes while working the fields of a Kibbutz and I know what F-18's can do. You don't hear them until they are already gone.   Nothing on this planet can do what I saw that day in 1980.  I've never told anyone except my Mother and my Aunt.   To this day I feel blessed to have witnessed something not from our imaginations but the reality of other life somewhere in the universe.   What a gift.  My best to all.

A triangular shape approximately two house lengths completely black hovering above the treeline across the street;2002-07-08 23:00:00;10 Seconds;A triangular shape approximately two house lengths completely black hovering above the treeline across the street My husband and I were sitting on the front porch.  I was looking at the sky and right above the treeline across the street, I saw a black shaped image triangular in shape.  I automatically pointed it out to my husband.  There was no noise, no nothing.  First thinking it was imagination, I blinked my eyes and it was still there.  In a matter of seconds, it disappeared. Approximately three weeks later, at approximately 9:30 p.m., while watching t.v., it sounded like a jet had just flown right above our house.  The house and windows shook.  Running outside, thinking we would have seen something, there was nothing.  The funny thing was, only our next door neighbor heard it and ran outside.  When we asked the other surrounding neighbors the next day, noone saw or heard it. It was just us, and our neighbor. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

Arrow head. Front had 4 rod shaped flourescent lights,  2 back corners, transparent center. Hand size at arms length;2003-09-26 04:00:00;15 seconds;Arrow head. Front had 4 rod shaped flourescent lights,  2 back corners, transparent center. Hand size at arms length I was on my second story balcony smoking a cigarette while looking up at a clear sky with bright stars as I always do. There was a storm coming in quickly to my right. My area of view is blocked to my left from my roof and trees block my view to my right leaving me a large patch of viewing sky in the middle. From my left a massive object appeared into my view and moved at a rapid pace towards the storm on my right. I got a great look at this object. It was shaped like an Indian arrow head. The front part of the triagle had 4 rod shaped glowing flourescent lights in a wedge shape and 2 on the back corners. The lights did not project. The center of this object looked transparent as it passed. For 15 seconds it sped across the sky without a sound. I held my hand up at arm's length and the object was slightly larger than it. I thought because of the massive size that it was flying by at a low altittude but when it reached the storm to my right I saw it go above the storm out of my view, not through it. I have a video camea with night vision and I'll be ready. I should of known better being a UFO enthusiast and neck kinking sky watcher. Thank you.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch at 2055 hrs (EDT).  PD))   Bright object seen in the sky, seemed to explode shortly after appearance.;2005-04-29 21:00:00;5 minutes;Bright object seen in the sky, seemed to explode shortly after appearance. At approximately 9 p.m on 4/29/05 4 friends and I were together, when I spotted a brilliant orange light in the western sky. My first reaction was that it was on fire. It did not appear to be a plane since we could see planes in the vicinity and the features on this seemed very different to airplane lights. This supposedly flaming light kept moving towards us for about a minute when suddenly it split into two. Both of the lights were as large and brilliant as the first one had been but now we could see smoke trails coming from them. This lasted for about 10 or 20 seconds when suddenly a third light appeared, this one was very dim and we only saw it because it seemed to be illuminated by the two other lights. At this point we began thinking it was only one object since with the appearance of the 3rd light, it formed a triangular pattern. This triangle suddenly stopped moving towards us and seemed to take a 45-degree path upwards. The Triangle was clearly visible for about 30 seconds when the two bright lights at the bottom disappeared. The smoke that had been emitted from these two bottom lights also stopped. The smaller dimmer one didn’t seem affected by this and kept rising for maybe a minute or 2 minutes longer. It was passing next to a star when suddenly it exploded. This explosion was not as an airplane’s is supposed to be, there was no fire visible but debris seemed to go in every direction and maybe a second after the original explosion a shockwave appeared. The shockwave was bright blue and it moved very quickly, shortly after this we were able to see debris from the explosion falling, very slowly. We were left speechless and wondering what it was. We checked the news outlets but there seemed to be nothing on this. Surely someone else had to see it. ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the witness describes above the launch of a Titan IV missile out of Cape Canaveral, which occurred at 20:55 hrs. (Eastern) on this date.  The missile apparently was launched to the northeast, so it was visible along the eastern shoreline of the U. S..  PD));25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393
Triangular Object spotted over Miami after powerful Hurricane,;2005-10-24 22:50:00;5-10 mins.;Triangular Object spotted over Miami after powerful Hurricane, This happened the night after Hurricane Wilma had devastated the area. Since there was no electricity, after the sun had set, sleep came quickly to my family. Me and my brother were still up, listening to the radio. I got up during the break and looked out the window at the sky and I saw a strange dot of light hovering over downtown in the east. It was bright yellow and moved up and down, and in generally peculiar directions for an aircraft. Suddenly the craft began moving westward. It came nearer and nearer to wear I was located. I was generally disturbed by the aircraft but, nonetheless, watched it diligently. I called my brother over as the aircraft neared. Eventually, the I realized the craft did not have one light, but was triangular shaped with three bright lights. It continued westward, and as it got closer, the radio started giving off strange sounds. It was a strange high-pitched static-like sound. The craft continued westward constantly, we watched, mystified and yet paralized with fear. As the craft passed our home and eventually our field of vision, the radio returned back to normal. Keep in mind this happened the day after the hurricane, our infrastructure was obliterated and no airplanes had been flying (or flew) for days afterward.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

I just reported a sighting about 20 minutes ago of a red round object.  After I reported this, I went back outside with my husband.  At9:45 p.m., there was a small plane that had passed in the eastern sky, going south to north.  About 10 seconds after this small plane passed, we saw a red triangle shaped craft in the southern sky, going east to west.  It made no noise, the sky was clear, and the object wobbled back and forth.  If measuerd in car speed, it was going approximately 50 miles per hour.  There were no other planes in sight.;25.7751358738192;-80.2539192263393

Miami suburb night sighting of a silent, low-hovering obtusely-angled arrangement of reddish lights;2007-08-11 23:00:00;Approx. 5 mins.;Miami suburb night sighting of a silent, low-hovering obtusely-angled arrangement of reddish lights Back in 2007, on a clear August night, I saw something in the sky that arrested my attention. My eyes locked on it as I tried to come to terms with what I was looking at. I was sitting in my car, engine off, driver's side window down - across the field from the elementary school I attended as a child - smoking a cigarette and listening to the radio. By pure chance, I turned my gaze out the window and upwards as I expelled a plume of smoke from my lungs, and there they were . . . Four reddish orbs, hovering substantially low in the sky, as silent as the surrounding night. They were NOT equidistant from each other but nonetheless arranged in a matter that allowed me to conclude that they formed the frame of an aircraft of some sort. Their placement in relation to one another seemed to suggest, to me, to form a shape of a triangle . . . the lights themselves forming an obtuse angle, stretching from left to right. The four lights were more left to right than up and down, and again, were NOT in a straight line, but formed an angle. Upon first setting eyes on the spectacle before me, I immediately shut off my radio. I have no recollection of radio interference whatsoever. If there had been, I'm sure I would remember it. There was no sound of traffic in the distance, as it was rather late at night and I wasn't anywhere near a main road or highway but tucked away in a residential neighborhood, blocks from my own house. The object was dead-silent and hardly moved, if at all.  The individual lights themselves didn't budge, nor flicker, blink, dim, or brighten.  Their illumination was constant. After staring up in utter awe for a few minutes, I looked away and reached for another cigarette, found my lighter, lit up, and then returned my eyes to the sight, at which point the lights were much further up in the sky, retreating into obscurity (and thus not as bright as they had been), and soon disappeared altogether. My best estimate of the time duration of my sighting is 5 minutes tops. I don't know what I saw that night, and not being a professional in the field of UFOs I don't pretend to identify what I saq but just merely describe what I witnessed.  And I will say this . . . in the faces of all those that might henceforth attempt to explain away my experience as if they had all the answers . . . I SAW WHAT I SAW AND NONE OF YOU CAN CHANGE THAT.  When you stop and think about it, where we're at in reference to UFOs, that's really all that can be said about a UFO sighting, isn't it?

A balloon, Blimp but as it got closer I saw a distinctive triangle with different colored lights. Red, Blue Yellow, and a little green.  But as it got closer I noticed that it was not only the triangle that the lights were lit.  But tiny little lines, not many but definitive lines of dimmer lights that were in the middle of the triangle. I called my wife to see and to get the camera.  We started to take pictures of the craft. And soon as the flashes of the camera were going off it seemed to move slowly in the opposite direction  north northeast.  Then went slowly upward into the clouds and now just blue lights were showing through the clouds.   I can send the pictures if requested.
