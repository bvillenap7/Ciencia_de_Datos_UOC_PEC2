AWESOM!! I'm a trucker and I was traveling westbound on Hwy.46 about 15 miles from I-95. I was about to enter seminole county and I saw the lights. I thought they were Helecopters,but,as I got closer, they were'nt moving. Just kinda of sitting in the sky, Very bright lites. I noticed a green/violet hue to there lites.  No sound cause I pulled over near a boat ramp to see. It just hit me when I read the sighting from the posting from orlando. I blew it off and never thought about it till now. I remember it like it was yesterday. They just hovered over the water in those lakes at the seminole/brevard county lines out in the swamp.I was going west and they were on my left side about 11 o'clock about 5,000 ft.from the water and just sitting in the sky.I never believed in this stuff till I saw it for myself.the formation was 3lites!;28.7502;-81.1126000000002
