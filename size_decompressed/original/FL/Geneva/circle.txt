Strange red lights suspended in air then vanished.;2013-11-02 21:45:00;3-5 minutes;Strange red lights suspended in air then vanished Was headed home on hwy 426 in Geneva around 9:30pm-9:45pm, just passing Seminole Woods subdivision when I noticed some peculiar reddish orange lights in the sky.  Found it kind of strange because they were very still and not moving.  They were suspended in the air.  It was dark a lot of stars in the sky however these stood out like a sore thumb and they were suspended very close about maybe 20-30 feet above Tree level.   My daughter said mom do you see those lights. I said yes honey probably beacon lights or maybe a helicopter  However as we observed the lights were not moving and weren't flashing they were about 8 to 9 of them in several angles and were very close.  There was no noise, no flashes, and they were not moving.   My mom was in the passenger seat and I said mom, do you see the lights?  She said yes that's strange.  We arrived home dropped off my mother and my daughter and I returned to see if they were still there to make sure we were not losing our minds.  They were all gone.;28.7502;-81.1126000000002
