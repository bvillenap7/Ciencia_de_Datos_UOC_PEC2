I was driving East on Hwy 46, just entering into the town of Geneva, Florida heading towards Interstate 95 at approximately 9:35 pm.  I was traveling about 60 MPH and I looked up to the left in the sky and saw a huge triangular shaped object that appeared to be ascending upward.  I saw the underside of it and it had vertical lines (rows) of red lights aligned in straight rows.  The lights were fading on and off, not quickly but maybe 3 seconds on, and 3 seconds off.  It was traveling West and since I was traveling East at 60 MPH, I only saw it for a brief time.  I tried to pull my car to the side of the road so I could turn around and watch more, but by the time I did, there was nothing more to see.;28.7502;-81.1126000000002
