We saw 50+ dots of light traveling in perfect unison one after the othe.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-29 21:40:00;5 Minutes;We saw 50+ dots of light traveling in perfect unison one after the other, appearing in one spot and disappearing in another. My father, mother, boyfriend, and I were outside our house watching the stars. We noticed a series of stars in a direct line and it took us a moment to realize that these stars were moving, perfectly alined and spaced exactly the same distance from each other moving in unison. The dots of light appeared to come out of thin air near a star and traveled in a diagonal line from bottom right to top left, and then proceeded to disappear next to another star.  As we sat and watched them, we saw at least 50 of them, appearing, moving in perfect union, and then disappearing shortly after allowing another to come into sight. This went on for about 5 minutes when all of a sudden they stopped appearing and we watched the last few dots of light disappear next to the top left star. We all were slightly shocked at this and we talked trying to come up with explanations for what we saw, an asteroid didn't make sense and there's no planes that could fly so close together and ! so perfectly alined. There really was no logical explanation for what we saw.;28.7502;-81.1126000000002
