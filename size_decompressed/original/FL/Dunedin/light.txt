Small ball of light moving very fast over Dunedin, FL.;2008-02-23 19:00:00;10-15 seconds;Small ball of light moving very fast over Dunedin, FL. I was standing in my driveway after getting out of my car when I noticed a light moving in the sky. First, I thought it was a shooting star, but then it kept going and I noticed there was no trail of any kind. About this time I saw the light wobble slightly and then continue its direct path to the east. I called to my wife who was standing close by and asked her if she new what that was as I pointed it out in the sky. Her mother who was also nearby came to look but the object was gone before she spotted anything. The light was small and bright at first, about the size and brightness of when I see Venus in the sky, then as it appeared to move fast to the east it began to fade and become reddish orange in color until it faded away completely. Then I noticed a jet airliner at a relatively high altitude and noticed that the light I had just seen was probably traveling about 3 to 4 times the speed and was probably at a much higher altitude. The whole event probably lasted 10-15 seconds and occurred around 7:00pm on February 23, 2008.;28.0303000000002;-82.7815999999994
