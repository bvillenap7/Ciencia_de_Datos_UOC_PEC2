two crafts one with a jet trail and one with out;2004-05-22 20:20:00;3 minutes;two crafts one with a jet trail and one with out in the sky to the north around sunset at first what appeared to be a jet trail racing almost stright up, looked more like a shuttle launch climbing fast caught our eye, but it appeared out of nowhere in the middle of the sky and became visible very high,and kept climbing from there, as we marveled at it suddenly a second one appeared only as a light, just appeared and climbed with it side by side but the second one had no trail and was obviously faster over taking the first one with the trail, then the first on veered off in to the eastern sky heading south east while the second one with no trail overtook and passed the first one, then they disappeard, i did not have good vision, but the other witness said she thought the second one was sort of triangle with slight wings maybe, all i saw was a ball of light;28.0303000000002;-82.7815999999994
