Fiery object in sky over Dunedin, Florida on 113013 at dusk.;2013-11-30 16:00:00;3 minutes;Fiery object in sky over Dunedin Florida on 113013 at dusk. I saw what I thought was a burning jet (because of the height).  It flew as if on course west of Dunedin parallel to the coast.  I thought it would start to loose altitude because it was on fire but it did not.  After watching for 2 minutes it turned directly west and flew out of site.  Strangest thing I ever saw in sky.  It happened just after dusk on 11/30/2013. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));28.0303000000002;-82.7815999999994
