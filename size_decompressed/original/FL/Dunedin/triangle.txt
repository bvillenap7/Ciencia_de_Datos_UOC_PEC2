About Two weeks ago aprox. 11:20 i was laying in bed about to fall asleep and i saw a bright light in the Sky. There were three lights on which looked like a Black Triangle. The lights were on the corners of the Triangle. It was going Fast, looked like it was going faster than an airplane. It was a very clear image you could clearly see the Black triangle. It Flew By and seem to have left, a couple seconds later it came back into clear veiw. Not sure if it was the same one or a second Craft. I was so amazed and very excited that is saw a UFO. This time it stayed there for about a minute. I got a very good look at it and it seemed to have a Silver circle in the middle of a black triangle. It flew away and i was amazed. I told everyone i knew. But no one believed me. So i came here and had to report it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date above apparently is approximate.  PD));28.0303000000002;-82.7815999999994
UFO's over Dunedin, FL nightly.  ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness is observing.  PD));2010-10-09 09:00:00;6 hours;UFO's over Dunedin, FL nightly. I live on the water near the marina and downtown.  Every night for the last month there are multiple triangular UFO's.  They have a bright light at the front and blue neon like lighted border.  Also, you can see 3 short blue beams coming out the center.  I can see a ton more at higher altitudes.   I also have pictures and video.  Also, the UFO's closest to the ground I could hear a slight humming noice.  They also slightly wobble. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness is observing.

While waiting at a light at SR5 80 and Pinehurst, I noted a large, dark deltoid shape with multiple lights hovering in the sky.  It reminded me of some craft I'd seen in UFO reports. I drove home, fairly nearby, and after stashing groceries decided to look for it again.  As I stood in my driveway I did not see the craft but did note a number of white lights rotating among themselves in the sky.   When I returned to my house several minutes later, the lights persisted.;28.0303000000002;-82.7815999999994
