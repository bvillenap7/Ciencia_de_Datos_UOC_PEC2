UFO Sighting on 6/26/2012 at 1:00am Intense Deep Bright Orange Intensifying Object Just Above Tree line on the West Coast of Fl.;2012-06-26 01:00:00;10 minutes;UFO Sighting on 6/26/2012 at 1:00am Intense Deep Bright Orange Intensifying Object Just Above Tree line on the West Coast of Fl. On 6/26/2012 at 1:00a.m. my dog needed to go out. It had been raining very hard and very windy due to Tropical Storm Debbie. When I opened the door I expected to have to use the umbrella but it had stopped raining. I walked the dog around my cul-de-sac and directly across the street from my house to the west above the tree line was  very bright deep orange lights. I was trying to figure out what I was looking at and I was mesmerized by the light. It was not high in the sky or was it far away. As I was looking at this light it was intensifying with a back & forth movement. I went into the house still trying to wrap my brain around what I had just seen. Later that morning my dog was in the yard and was barking loudly at 2 baby owls sitting on my back fence. My husband grabed his phone & took a picture of them. He watched them later fly into our Palm Tree where they stayed for 2 days. On 6/28/2012 he took pictures of them and I sent those on to you Mr. Davenpor! t. I had told a close friend about what I saw and then I tried to report it to the local news networks but they said that it wasn't newsworthy. I beg to differ....Then on the morning of 6/28/2012 on GMA at 7:30 there was a report by Robin Roberts and George Stepanopolis  about UFO sightings and my friend then called that what I had told her 2 days ago was being verified in different states.  From then on I have been trying to process what I have seen and know to be real. We are not alone.  Since the sighting or encounter I have been feeling very anxious because I do not feel free to discuss this .  I am certain about what I have seen. My dog saw it also because he used to love to go out and walk but now he will not go past the driveway. He turns around and wants to go back into the house. He also stands behind the heavy wood Door and barks at nothing? I feel like I have expierenced something so very special but on the other hand it makes me feel like we have absolutely no cont! rol over anything. Thank YouUFO;28.0303000000002;-82.7815999999994
