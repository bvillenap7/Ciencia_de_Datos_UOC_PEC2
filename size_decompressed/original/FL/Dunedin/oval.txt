If you look at the three pictures in sequence they were all taken in the same minute. The object broke the clouds then disappeared before I took the next picture. I do not know how many seconds went by before the next picture was taken but it was in the same minute. I find it strange the object obviously moved the clouds but then could disappear and have no signs of changes in the clouds in the next picture. I guess the clouds move quick enough to fill in that space. Based on the size of the building below the object it would have to be pretty large, at least a 100’ across.  Everyone tries to explain these sightings away but I can’t explain how this object moved the clouds and disappeared within seconds.;28.0303000000002;-82.7815999999994
