Zips around the sky and zooms off I saw a UFO over the Gulf of Mexico off of Dunedin, FL that looks like the one that the F-18s were chasing on the History Channel. My neighbor, who is a retired Lt Fire Fighter says that he and his family saw one just like it on their farm when he was younger and it flew the same way. It just disappears and reappears nearby numerous times then glows and disappears permanently.;28.0303000000002;-82.7815999999994
