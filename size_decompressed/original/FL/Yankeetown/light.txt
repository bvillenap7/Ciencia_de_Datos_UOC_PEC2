Very distant. Small pinpoint light in the sky.  Light was seen moving very slowly west to east far to the north 1-20 degrees above the horizon. Light appeared to have extremely rapid up-down movements which would have been very dramatic altitude changes.  The light also appeared and disappeared several times over at least an hour's time.  There were thunderstorms FAR in that direction that made it unlikely to be a star and the light's being low on the horizon made it clear that it was moving as I could see stationary lights on channel markers nearby.  The light was at least as far away as Cedar key. NO known aircraft could change altitude like this.;29.0273;-82.7216
