Belle Glade, Florida—March 13, 2006	  Driving north from Key Largo, Florida around the time of three A.M., we (my boyfriend, Fred Brosn;2006-03-13 02:00:00;20sec;Belle Glade, Florida—March 13, 2006	  Driving north from Key Largo, Florida around the time of three A.M., we (my boyfriend, Fred Brosnihan) passed what it appeared to be a quiet, very dark everglades area.  The only lights around us were the stars in the sky, and everything else was pitch-black darkness surrounding us.   As we approached the town of Belle Glade to the right of me high up in the sky about three hundred yards away were little rows green lights in the form of a diamond with a reddish hue on the outer edges.  This diamond-like object was about what appeared on the ground at eye level to be about the size of a child’s size small diamond kite.  As I was trying to make out what those lights could possibly be, the form of lights seemed to start falling like a leaf in the wind and then before I knew it, the whole lighted phenomenon disappeared without a single trace.  It moved as if it was as light as a feather that was rocking back and forth in the wind in a carefree fashion.  I can’t explain what this could have been, as I have seen nothing like this before.  My boyfriend who was in the drivers seat had also seen what I had seen, although he had seen the reflection of this through the front window of the car.  I don’t know what this sighting was, but it was beautiful and remarkable at the same time and I was disappointed it went away so quickly.;26.6875;-80.6708
