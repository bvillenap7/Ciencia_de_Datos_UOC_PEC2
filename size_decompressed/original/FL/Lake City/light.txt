((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch at 2055 hrs (EDT).  PD))   3 orange lights forming triangle, 2 stationary lights;2005-04-29 21:00:00;12 seconds;3 orange lights forming triangle, 2 stationary lights disappear as middle light moves and disappears in puff of smoke While watching T.V., I noticed from the corner of my eye, three lights appear from the east out of our open second story window just above the tree line. I informed the other two witnesses and they confirmed the sighting of the object or objects. They were large orange lights which formed into the shape of a triangle with the smaller middle light traveling north while the two other lights stayed stationary. the stationary lights disappered followed by the middle light shortly after. the middle light disappeared with forming a circular puff of smoke in the night sky.

Light meandering West to Easy in North Florida.;2019-06-26 22:30:00;180 seconds;Light meandering West to Easy in North Florida. Standing outside in my front yard this evening, on the phone, I noted several drones or what appear to be  similar surveillance tasked aircraft when suddenly from the West moving due east - a light that behaved (aside from the obvious slow but visible movement East) as a planet would, devoid of twinkling, and having about the apparent magnitude of the planet Saturn would on a good night for observation via telescope. This light meandered very oddly modulating its North - South position on its trajectory constantly and in conjunction with its Eastward momentum.  Strangely the apparent magnitude of the light became increasingly dim as it progressed further to the East, eventually requiring some deal of focus to locate and identify during its remaining trek slowly travelling with the equivalent of a multiple drug influenced, severely drunken man's synergism fueled wobbly gait over the horizon.;30.1717069306931;-82.6451663366336
Fast with momentary light trail.;2019-08-05 22:47:00;3 seconds;Fast with momentary light trail On a partially cloudy night while traveling on I-75 southbound just west of Lake City, FL  I noticed a very bright light in the east.  I first thought helicopter due to flying low just beneath the clouds but it sped up very rapidly and left a very bright white light trail behind it as it travelled west across the highway.  The ufo suddenly stopped trailing and returned to original speed, then quickly disappeared west.  I’ve been around military aircraft and nothing I’ve seen can move that fast.  It was so fast I’ll never forget it.  I would have dismissed it as just a new jet I never saw before, but it left a solid white light trail in the sky that lingered for a good 3 seconds and was itself lit up.  The ufo was a bright light and I could not determine a shape.;30.1717069306931;-82.6451663366336
