Bright Light approx 3 miles able to get under it with sunroof open;1983-07-15 18:00:00;7 Mins;Bright Light approx 3 miles able to get under it with sunroof open We were leaving a friends home and as soon as the car was facing west on Baya Ave we noticed a very large bright light hovering in the near distance.  We proceeded west on Baya to the intersection with US 90 west, a traffic light stopped us directly under the object that was hovering/with the sun roof open. There were many other cars stopped as well.  I knew that many others had to witness this event.  The object had a large round ball of light at the front with what appeared to be 2 prongs sticking out of the rear at an angle of 45 degrees, ladder like silver colored things seem to connect the prongs.  We were under it for the entire red light, it then made a sequence of beeps (computer noise) is what I called it then and diappeared within 2 seconds completely out of sight.  I did a u-turn at the light and went directly to the Lake City police station where we filed a report. I told the officer I did not want him to think I was crazy, but I was shaking, overtaken by the event.  He explained to me that he did not think us crazy at all, because himself and a group of officers were called to a home in south Columbia county where a craft hovered directly over 5 police officers and took off @ a speed as unbelievable as the one I had described.  I still get goose bumps to this day talking about it.  This is the only report of this kind I have ever made. I might add the car stereo and lights reacted strangley for a few moments.  The cassette player kept rewinding the same song.  The car stalled briefly. The clock lost time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));30.1717069306931;-82.6451663366336
Triangular craft using cloud cover not to be seen.;2003-08-10 06:50:00;3 seconds;Triangular craft using cloud cover not to be seen. I saw this object as I was leaving Lake City, where I work. It was a cloudy morning with low cloud cover, as I was going up a hill part of the cloud disappeared. All I saw was the front of an extremely large craft. It was triangular in the front and was getting wider toward the back. I saw what appeared to be plates on the side coming to an edge like the top of a pup tent. It was the color of bronze and it flew very slow because it was moving with the clouds. I'm not aware of any government craft that is this large my estimation since the back wasn't visible would be two large aircraft carrierss. Now I have to appologize to everyone who has seen a UFO and reported it because I didn't believe in them until it happened to me. Art Bell said once you've seen one your life is changed I now know what he means. Has anyone seen similar craft to this?;30.1717069306931;-82.6451663366336
