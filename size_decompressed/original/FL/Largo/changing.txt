I notice what appears to look like a dark colored plane with all the windows lit like the lights were on in the plane.;2017-04-26 00:00:00;10-15 seconds;Me my brother and best friend were walking down the street it was a side street off of Seminole Blvd in Largo, FL.  The clouds were in some spots completely clear and in other areas cloudy.   So as we are walking I notice what appears to look like a dark colored plane with all the windows lit like the lights were on in the plane  as soon as I told everyone to look at how huge the plane was, it spun all the way from the clouds down right in front of us within seconds.  When it came down, the ufo, or what ever you want to call it, made the loudest wooshing noise there wasn't even wind but was extremely loud hovering over the houses, but maybe a couple hundred feet away from us, it stopped in mid air, it appeared to be an extremely large saucer it was long not extremely tall but very wide and it had parallel red flashing short lights in what appeared to be the middle to me and long green lights out to the side as soon as I seen it for the little amount of time that It did it spun right back up the way it came it disappeared behind the cloud and didn't see it again, but it was extremely alarming I never believed in anything of the sort I always thought people were just having fun or being weird trying to become a sensation or something, but I'm a firm believer now and very terrified it came so close to us I thought we were goners when it happened ...  Mind you the next day I had to ride a plane, I was so scared.;27.8882873952016;-82.7695048568968
