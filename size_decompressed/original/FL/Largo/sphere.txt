People came out of their homes and I said, Look up, they stood in awe as orbs swirled around overhead, then they moved to different parts of the sky.  When I got home they were still swirling, some bigger than others.  Like angels flying around fast, many many of them.  They are still there, over an hour later, still moving in all directions, they are like a clan, they all move together in the group although they each swirl individually.
