Fireball moving  horizontal in the sky.;2014-05-17 22:05:00;2-3 minutes;Fireball moving  horizontal in the sky. I saw a fireball in the sky about 10:05 pm moving west toward the beach.  It was moving perfectly horizontal.  It was not a plane or meteor.  It was moving slightly faster than a plane. It looked as of it were on fire with yellow, orange and red colors.  I watched it for maybe 2 minutes.  At about the time it appeared over the beach area it suddenly was gone.;27.8882873952016;-82.7695048568968
