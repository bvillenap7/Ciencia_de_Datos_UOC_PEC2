Multiple lights moving in formation.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-22 06:05:00;60 seconds;Multiple lights moving in formation Arrived at work, still dark outside. Got out of my vehicle, and in the northern sky something caught my eye. At first glance I assumed it was a satellite, which I see often. Immediately, I noticed there were several more. The first to were in tight formation and offset, with another 5 or 6 behind it, evenly spaced. Moving towards the north from the west, there speeds appeared to be relative, as their positions to one another never altered. Maybe around 8 or so moved past until they were out of sight, and while I was standing there trying to comprehend what I just saw, another grouping of around 5 or 6 came through. This second grouping was positioned almost identical to the first.  Same speed, position, heading, etc.  As I said, I see satellites almost daily early mornings/later in the evenings. If it had been just one of these I wouldn't have thought anything otherwise. But I've never seen so many so closely and on identical trajectories.;27.8882873952016;-82.7695048568968
