V shaped light formation traveling in a south-west direction;2004-10-27 22:18:00;1 minute;V shaped light formation traveling in a south-west direction My family and I (5 of us) were outside watching the lunar eclipse.  All of a sudden above us appeared a triangular shaped craft that had five disk shapes on the underside that appeared to be softly glowing.  Not like lights but more like a soft glow.  The disc were much larger than airplane lights.  The aircraft moved very quickly in a southwest direction and suddenly there was a single soft circular shape that moved in the opposite direction of the triangular shape.  Both moved very fast without any sound and as quickly as they appeared, they disappeared.;27.8882873952016;-82.7695048568968
2 triangle shaped, 9 small circular, 1 fast blue flash object;2021-06-10 10:00:00;40 minutes;2 triangle shaped, 9 small circular, 1 fast blue flash object 1 triangle shaped moved slowly from North to South, it like 4 different bright lights  Then 9 smaller spherical craft  with only 1 bright light came in almost like a straight line from the West heading East then curved and started turning North in the direction the first one came from in a drone like pattern.  Then a giant blue flash appeared, very low in altitude from the West and another triangle object appeared like the fist one came out.  One last spherical object came from the East turning North, this was saucer like,  The first triangle that went passed moved North slowly back from the way it came and the second triangle followed behind.   I came running from the backyard to my father pointed out the first object to him. As I walked back 9 more spherical came from the West and is how it unfolded. I ended watching the rest from it the street trying to take pictures.;27.8882873952016;-82.7695048568968
