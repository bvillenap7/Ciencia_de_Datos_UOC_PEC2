Boy gets friend to believe in UFOs with big ball of light.;1999-07-20 23:00:00;10 minutes;Boy gets friend to believe in UFOs with big ball of light. It was a real dark and clear night and at the time I had already been a big believer in UFOs and aliens. My friend Matt wasn't though. We were watching a movie and he was messing with me about the alien stuff. So I did to. I pointed to a plane and said there's a ufo. We laughed and kept watching the movie. Five minutes litter it was like they hard my thoughs that I wish he believed me about this stuff because I looked out the window and said, Now there's a UFO. We both ran outside and looked into the distence. There was a ball of light huvering in the sky. We were watching it and from out perseption it was not to far over the trees in the distence. It was moving very slow in a curved diagnal way. It moved around over the trees like it was making sure we could see it. It suddenly started changing color. It first turned bright red then blue then green, and orange then all the colors of the rainbow. Then it doubled in size and turned bright red again. Then shrunk down and turned white and just disipeared into the air. We saw it reappear in flashes for only a few seconds over our heads for several minutes. I was so happy the my friend saw it with me. He still can't believe what he saw to this day even though I conferm everything that he saw.;27.8882873952016;-82.7695048568968
Fast moving flashing lights ,seen over Largo,fl..;2001-09-05 00:30:00;about two mins.;Fast moving flashing lights ,seen over Largo,fl.. I was driving home from work heading north on starky rd in Largo, It was after midnight. I notice a flashing light in the sky coming out of some clouds heading east .At first i thought it was a airplane heading for st.pete/clearwater airport. It was on a flight path for it. Then at a very high speed turn south coming my way. Then i notice it wasn't just one big light flashing as it got closer. there was at least four lights almost flashing at same time. The lights where..not really white,They just didn't look like lights from a airplane. At this point i stop the car, and got out to get a really good look at it.Before it got right about me,i notice the lights on the bottom of it was like a blacklight color'purple,or a blueish color'if you know what i mean. My car was still running and i had the radio on, the radio went out, and my car almost died ,At this time it picked up speed and took off out view to the southeast.The one thing the gets me, there was no sound, nothing from it,or bugs..I live in florida theres a ton of bugs that make alot of noise at night.I didn't notice this til i was going to leave. funny thing is,when i was getting in to my car there was three other cars pulled off the road watching it. We all talked about it for a bit ,before we left .One of the guys took a pics of this, I'm trying to get a hold of him for a copy of the pics, I just hope they come out good. just in case i drew somes pics of it i can send in.

After long drawn out  thunderous echo went outside to investigate.Saw  5 then 6 lights in SW sky .;2010-09-07 22:30:00;5 minutes;After long drawn out  thunderous echo went outside to investigate. Saw  5 then 6 lights in SW sky . Being startled from relaxing inside the house last evening,we heard a startling long drawn out  thunderous echo outside.  Sound I will describe as between Thunder,a Jet fighter and the Space shuttle that went on echoing for 45 seconds to a minute.  I went out to investigate looking in the direction I thought the sound was going (N to NW) but I saw nothing. When I turned back past an oak tree I looked into the sky in the opposite direction(S to SW)and saw 5 lights very close together at about 70 degrees. These lights were far off looking and seemingly twinkled or blinked and were different colors. I called my gf out to see,she saw them and was taken back as how unusual it was.  As we watched,it first was 2 pair of lights side by side and one lower.  They appeared to change formation with a 6th one showing up above those. This lasted for a few minutes and then cloud cover made it impossible to see any longer. Also...If it has any connection...about 20 minutes earlier! before all this, a really loud helicopter with a bright spot light flew over and around for aprox 2 minutes and then disappeared.;27.8882873952016;-82.7695048568968
