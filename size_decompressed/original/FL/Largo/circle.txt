round flying object, Largo, FL.;2006-05-07 07:40:00;25 seconds;round flying object, Largo, FL. I was sitting outside enjoying the evening when i saw a round object flying across the sky (sideways) from west to east. It was very direct and at a pretty good speed. I stood up and kinda walked along to watch it because i've seen something similar here in Largo a few years ago (someone else actually reported seeing that here in Largo, FL).  I saw a jet flying south east and i could compare the two. This object was perfectly round and looked nothing like a plane/jet. The color was kinda strange and i can't explain it. It might have been from the orange glow of the setting sun. It looked sorta pale orange/gold or something. And just like the last one i saw a few years ago, it just disappeared. It didn't get smaller or anything it was just gone. There were a few clouds but they were really low. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Saw a flashing light move strait up,stop still in the sky & strait sideways & then lower down slow;2013-12-06 21:45:00;5 minutes;saw a flashing light move strait up,stop still in the sky & strait sideways & then lower down slow i was smoking a cigarette when i noticed what looked like a plane, it was bright green flashing red..  i did not think any thing of it till noticed it moving very fast strait upright and then it stopped still and stationary, i was shocked so i ran to get my phone from a room in the house and went right back outside..  after it sat still for a moment it moved quickly sideways,  i could not believe my eyes.  after stopping again and sitting still for a moment it started to move strait down and out of my view over the tree line,  i was frankly speechless..i cannot explain what i saw and i can think of nothing like a plane or anything else that exists that can do what i saw,  i am 36 years old and have never seen anything like it in my life..i was however able to get a poor photo and some poor video footage but it does not show much more than a flashing light moving in the sky..it was very dark and clear that night..;27.8882873952016;-82.7695048568968
Bright orange circular craft, silent and fast.;2013-12-31 23:22:00;2-3 minutes;Bright orange circular craft, silent and fast. The object was circular and silent.  We were outside lighting fireworks and we live near the beach.  When we first saw it we assumed it was a flare but when it did not descend and began to gain speed we realized it was not.  It was very bright and orange, it was silent.  It began to make large jumps east and west while it was traveling south.  Never have seen anything like this.;27.8882873952016;-82.7695048568968

Saw two red balls, one on top of the other.. Then the bottom red ball disappeared into the top one.;2018-03-18 20:30:00;10 seconds;Saw two red balls one on top of the other.. Then the bottom red ball disappeared into the top one. I went to go to my vehicle at about 8 30 at night.  I'm always scanning the sky to look for local aircraft in the sky.   Well to my surprise I looked off to the south and saw two RED balls one on top of the other.. by a decent amount.. yet too close for aircraft to be flying..  So this caught my attention.. as I looked up..  Neither seemed to be moving.. they both were IDLE in the sky...  I found this rather weird... then next thing I know the BOTTOM red ball started going upwards..  I thought I was about to see a mid air collision of some type...  Next thing I know the bottom ball disappeared into the TOP ball.. then only saw the TOP fire red ball.. then the top one remained for another few seconds only to disappear.  Was very ODD!

It was stationary just above the treeline for 2 or 3 seconds.  Then, it abruptly shot upwards in a parabolic trajectory, to the left impossibly fast then down.  As it descended below tree line, it could no longer be visualized.;27.8882873952016;-82.7695048568968
