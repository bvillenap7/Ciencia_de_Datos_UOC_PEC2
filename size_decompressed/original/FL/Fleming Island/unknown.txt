After he left I was half awake and noticed a very high pitched sound, akin to ringing in the ear.  It was bothering me so I got up, went to the restroom and afterwards started looking for something that may be causing that sound.  Could not find anything.  Went out on the deck of my apt to see if anything in the parking lot was running to make that sound.  Saw nothing on the ground so I searched the sky.  To the right I notic3d two sets of lights.  One set was much brighter than the other.  The less bright set of lights were sort of moving like a twinkle of a star but was always about the same distance away from the other set of lights.  I went to find my binoculars to get a better view.  I came back with them and brought the lights into better focus.  The brighter of the two looked to have about 3 to 4 light panels very clearly visible facing in my direction.  There were what appeared to be more lights! to the top and side because it cast a glow in all directions.   I watched both of these until the disappeared beyond the top of the apt roof line.  It was about a half hour in total. I will assume it was the crafts making the high pitched sounds.  Tried to get a picture or video but it was too dark and my phone and tablet camera could not bring it into view.;30.0955;-81.7197999999999
