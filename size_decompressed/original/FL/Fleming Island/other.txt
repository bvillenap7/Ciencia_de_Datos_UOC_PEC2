We live on the 3rd floor of our Apartment.  He said look at this object in the sky, There was a bright far away fuzzy looking object in the sky above the tree tops from where we were standing in the north west sky.  At first I thought it was a star, but  it moved in closer and it appeared to have a hazy glow so I went inside to get my binoculars.  While I was inside the object moved somewhat closer. The object  looked like a top that young children use to play with. The tips of object both top and bottom extended to a point the middle was of course round but the strange thing was the object was encircled in fluorescent reddish orange light that lined the whole object. It  had squares throughout the top that were set apart from each other in equal size. The squares looked like windows and/ or small rooms with white flat pads on the bottom of the squares or rooms. I saw nothing but light in the squares and the round pod or pad on the botton of each square or room - I saw nothing move inside the windows the squares were empty with bright light shining throughout each square. The squares were also surrounded by reddish orange fluorescent moving light all around them like static haze. I have never seen a UFO before and didn't want to. I can't explain what it must have been but you would have to see it to know it is not like any object I have ever seen.;30.0955;-81.7197999999999
