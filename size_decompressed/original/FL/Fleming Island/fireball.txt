Large Fireball Seen Falling from East to West;2008-08-02 21:30:00;10 secs;Large Fireball Seen Falling from East to West While sitting in front yard of home with neighbors enjoying the evening, my neighbor and I witnessed a fireball moving from Southeast to Southwest, falling downward until it disappeared from our view. It may have been a meteoroid or other debris entering Earths atmosphere. The fireball had a long tail and lasted for almost 10 seconds. The object did not make any noise that we were able to hear from our vantage point. This event would appear to be the one as witnessed by several others in Ocala, FL(see other sighting from same date) which is about 45 miles south of Flemming Island. I would love to know what it was we saw.;30.0955;-81.7197999999999
