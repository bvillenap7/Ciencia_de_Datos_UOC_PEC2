Bight, stationary lights located over the Atlantic ocean.;2001-05-21 20:30:00;20 min;Bight, stationary lights located over the Atlantic ocean. The crafts were seen over the Atlantic ocean.  It started with what was believed to be a shooting star from the general direction of the sighting.  One bright light appered and seemed to not move.  Then a sencond light appeared to the south of the first, then disappeared.  The second light reappeared followed by a third, then a forth, then a fith.  The pattern of which oreder they appeared I'm not sure, but I am sure the first to appear was the last to disappear.  They were in a random patteren with the first light maintaining the highest point.  All lights appeared to stay stationary.  They then disappered one at a time, with the last one splitting into two lights before it disappeared.  This sighting lasted around 20 mins. I was able to capture sighting on video camera, although it it was getting to be dusk you are able to see all lights and watch them disappear.;28.0217;-80.5395000000003
Unidentified  Flying Objects off the coast of Melbourne Florida;2001-07-29 23:30:00;45 minutes;Unidentified  Flying Objects off the coast of Melbourne Florida On a clear Sunday night, while on vacation on Melbourne Beach, Florida, my husband, 9 year-old grandson and myself all observed the following from the balcony of our ocean side hotel room: toward the south, over the ocean, I saw what I thought was a very bright star or perhaps a planet.  It was twinkling fast and white, disappeared for a second, and reappeared flashing red, green, and white.  I called my husband and grandson to come out to the balcony to see this  my husband had a pair of binoculars (10x25)and used them to better see this thing.  To the naked eye, there appeared to be three spheres, blinking  red, green and white lights, seeming to go one in front of the other, then seperate to the left and right of each other, going up and down diagnonally. We stood there mesmerized watching this for about 45 minutes. Using binoculars, my husband was better able to the action: he observed these objects rotating each other, with two white lights in the front, and the red  and green ones on either side of the shape. One appeared to be stationary, while the others circled it. One remained ,on what we think was the surface of the water for quite some time. When we mentioned this to one of the maids the next morning, she told us that, There's always things there, don't forget that Patrick Air Force Base is not to far away. Patrick Air Force Base is about 8 miles north from our observation point.;28.0217;-80.5395000000003
