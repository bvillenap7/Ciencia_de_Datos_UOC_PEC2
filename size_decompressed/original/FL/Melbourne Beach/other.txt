This folloowed a lighning storm and there were some clouds remaining over the ocean...thye shape changed and became sperical, as if you were looking at the bottom half of the moon the top half being covered by clouds.  The red/orang-red became brighter and the shape continued to morph.  We thought, perhaps, a faulty rocket was falling from Cape Canaveral or, perhaps, lightning had struck a craft at sea and it had caught fire.  Suddenly, as we continued to watch, it gave another heave of hue/brightness and disappeared/stopped/blinked out. It was beautiful, starnge and a bit unsettling.  I was raised on this ocean and have never seen anything like this on any continent, above any ocean or body of water.   If anyone else witnessed this, I'd appreciate hearing from them...thank you!;28.0217;-80.5395000000003
