I stopped and watched it pass by for approx 30 seconds and I was almost expecting it to blow up or crash but it just slowly went by and disappeared.  It didn't appear to go down towards the Melbourne airport as I would have expected.  The sky was clear and a neighbor walked by the other direction but she did not see it object, it had disappeared at that time but I told her my observation.  She mentioned other sightings in the area which is why I am reporting this one.  I seriously thought it was a sessna aircraft on fire.;28.0217;-80.5395000000003
