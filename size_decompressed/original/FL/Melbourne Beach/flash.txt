They moved erratically and kept flashing the whole time that I saw them.  I was looking out the window to see the rain when I noticed them.  I checked on them from various windows in my house and they were the same from each one.  As I was watching them, they just vanished. My husband and I also had a similar sighting on Saturday (10-20-2012)evening.  We were sitting at the beach on the deck and looking south at the lightening storm.  Two flashing lights also appeared and did not seem to move as a plane lights would.  They also just vanished after about 5 minutes.;28.0217;-80.5395000000003
