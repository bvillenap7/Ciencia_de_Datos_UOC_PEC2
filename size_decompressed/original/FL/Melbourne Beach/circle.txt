What looked like a bright green ball entering the atmosphere.;1998-09-15 22:00:00;10sec;What looked like a bright green ball entering the atmosphere. My girlfriend and I were just pulling up to our house when we both saw a large glowing green ball fly across the sky in front of us. It was partly cloudy and we could only see the object for about 10 seconds before it went behind the clouds. It was around 2200 Hrs. In the middle of Sept. There was only one object that we could see.;28.0217;-80.5395000000003
Reddish-yellow glowing ball moving across the sky in an even ascending direction.;2014-08-29 23:30:00;10 minutes;Reddish-yellow glowing ball moving across the sky in an even ascending direction I saw this glowing ball in the sky behind my house at some distance.  It was some color red-yellow and glowed like a fire and cast a glow up into a space above it.  It traveled smoothly and not too quickly across the sky in an easterly direction away from the ocean.   I went outside and watched it as until its path was prevented from view due to trees.  I went out into the front of my house in the street and watched it proceed off in to the east and increasing in height.  It never changed speed and the color and glow never changed.   I watched it until it disappeared amongst the stars very very high in the sky in the distance.  There was no noise at all.  No engine sound.  There was no wind at the time.   I have no explanation what this was that I saw.  It was not a hot air balloon as it moved too fast and there are no hot air balloons in this area ever.   It came from the ocean direction as I live just 4 houses from the ocean. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she seemed to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  We suspect that she is a very good witness.  PD));28.0217;-80.5395000000003
