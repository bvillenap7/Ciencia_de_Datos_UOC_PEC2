Three fireballs moving slowly across sky.;2014-01-12 18:30:00;7 minutes;Three fireballs moving slowly across sky Three orange fireballs moving slowly from east to west.  One was smaller than the other two and flickered out quickly.  The remaining two continued moving in straight line, single file, silently.  A second one flickered and went out, but the third one continued to cover nearly 3/4 of the sky before it also burned out.  My son filmed it on his iPhone, but the image does not do justice to the brilliance of the color and brightness of these orbs.  I have no idea.  Perhaps it was a meteor, but they moved so much more slowly than any meteor I have ever witnessed.  Their speed was more like that of a typical airplane, but these lights did not behave at all like airplane lights.  They really looked like fireballs.  There were planes in the sky whose pilots must have witnessed this event.;29.6669;-81.6579000000001
