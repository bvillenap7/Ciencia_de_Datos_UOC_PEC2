While working on a roof on a 3 story home in Palatka, Fla I looked to the west and saw an oval shaped dark and light gray craft approximately 100 feet above the tree line maybe 1/2 mile away, I called to my nephew who was also on the roof. We both saw the object which appeared to be anywhere from 40-50 feet in diameter, it had alternating vertical panels of dark and light gray. It seemed to be slowly drifting to the west where it disappeared behind the tree line. We could not hear any sound. I do not know what it was, but I tell what it wasn't, a balloon, helicopter, airplane, cloud, reflection, star, banner, reflected light, or any thing I have ever seen.;29.6669;-81.6579000000001
