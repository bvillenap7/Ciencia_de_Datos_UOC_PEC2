Wife and I saw 6 flare like objects take off from north and proceed west.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is former USMC.  PD));2011-12-25 20:30:00;8 - 10 min;Wife and I saw 6 flare like objects take off from north and proceed west. It is now 8:45 PM, December 25th (Christmas Night) 2011.  About 15 minutes ago, I went out with my wife, into our back yard in Delray Beach, Florida.  Our back yard has another residence about 60 - 75 feet north of where we were standing.  I noticed what I thought was an aircraft to the north when two more bright red objects appeared over the roof of the residence to the north. I was in the USMC air-wing.  I grew up studying aircraft of all types.  I know what they look like day, or night.  They were red and white, but not blinking steadily.  They appeared more like a twinkling between red and white, only far brighter than any navigational lights I've ever seen.  I would have said they were fireworks, but fireworks don't fly off at an upward angle like these did. I got my wife's attention, saying: Look at that!, while pointing at the two new red objects.  They were gaining altitude and heading west at about a 25 degree angle from the horizontal.  They another one appeared over the roof.  And another, and still another.   There were six in all.  They weren't in any formation unless it was so staggered it didn't look like a formation, but they all originated at approximately the same place and all were on a relatively similar, but not exact trajectory.  After about 8 - 10 minutes they had disappeared one by one. Neither my wife, Nor I have ever seen anything like these things, and I'm familiar enough with all types of aircraft to know aircraft when I see them. At air shows I can point at a B-17, tell that it's a G model, recall that there were just over 12,000 made and it has four Wright 16-20 1200HP engines and a crew of 10.  At one air show, a group of old timers were looking up asking what the aircraft were that were flying over at about 10,000 ft.  I looked up and told them they were OV-10s.  I've met those that know more about aircraft than I do, but not too often. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is former USMC.  PD));26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
2 fiery orange spheres moving west to east.;2012-12-17 17:30:00;5 minutes;2 fiery orange spheres moving west to east I was swimming by myself at about 7:30 P.M. In Delray Beach, Florida on Monday, December 17,2012, when  I saw a bright orange light approaching from the west and heading straight east.   At first I momentarily thought it was fireworks, then when it kept moving through the sky I thought it might be part of the meteor display I had been told about.  But the light kept coming steadily and really didn't seem like a meteor.  Next I thought it might be a helicopter with a bright search light.  But as it came closer there was no helicopter noise.  And then I thought it was a plane on fire.  I was horrified.  But it kept moving at the same speed and did not change direction.  It passed completely over and I watched it go east  over the Atlantic Ocean.   This took about 2 minutes. I turned back to the west to get out of the pool and was astounded to see another flaming ball approaching from the west following in the same path as the first going at exactly the same speed.   I could still see the first orange red fireball and watched as the second one silently followed the first out over the ocean.  They appeared to stay at exactly the same height. I gradually lost sight of the first one and then lost sight of the second about 2 minutes later.  The total time seemed to be about 5 minutes.  At first I thought they might have been military experiments.  But after some cursory research,  I suspect they are pieces of space debris still in orbit but on fire.  Seeing as there are hundreds of thousands of pieces of space debris out there, this makes the most sense.  Especially given their straight path and steady speed.  What do you think?;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
Solid orange glow that got bigger and blurry when falling then rose, got smaller and headed North East.;2012-12-25 19:00:00;5 minutes;Solid orange glow that got bigger and blurry when falling then rose, got smaller and headed North East. Merry Christmas.  My neighbors and I saw what looked like a plane on fire comming down from the sky. However, it was as if it was in slow motion.  The ball was getting bigger as it lost altitude and started to get blurry as it grew in size.  Then it shrunk again and gained altitude and headed North East.  This was a solid orange glow.  I've never seen any airplanes do this.  Most planes have white lights.  This was a solid orange light.   After reading the post from 12/21/2012 in Pompano Beach I guess I'm not crazy.;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
