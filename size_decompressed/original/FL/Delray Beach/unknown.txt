row of lg bright lights appear and disappear about the height of street lights;2001-06-30 19:00:00;seconds;row of lg bright lights appear and disappear about the height of street lights Unfortunately, this report should have been sent about 6 yrs or so ago.  I just didnâ€™t want to believe what I saw.  However, the more I think about it, I felt that I should at least have this on record.  Perhaps others saw this as well in Florida. I live in western Delray Beach, Florida. One night, my youngest son (he was about 12-13 yrs old) and I were driving home.  Just before our turn into our development we both saw a row of lights (about 4 very large lights-as big as a car?) appear about 1 mile north of us right where the traffic light is for Atlantic  Ave. and State Rd 441.   The height seemed to have been right at the height of the traffic lights or just above them.  They  appeared and then left.  It seemed like slow motion and as if time had stopped.  The two of us looked at each other and then away silently, never asking the other anything.  It took us a couple of days to even broach the subject when we both joked about possibly seeing a UFO.  Over the years we have joked with each other, but also saying that we both believe what we saw is closer to that of a UFO than anything else. It was very dark out (the development that exists on the east side of the road across from my development did not exist at the time.)--we had very few street lights at that time in our area.  So, it was very dark, with just the street lights in front of us one mile ahead. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
3 circular objects in a V or triangle formation, appearance slightly orange light, moving East.;2014-07-04 22:00:00;2 minutes;3 circular objects in a V or triangle formation, appearance slightly orange light, moving East. I live in the vicinity of Miitary Trail/Atlantic in Delray Beach.  I looked up because fireworks going on all around me and notice three circles in the sky high enough not to be fireworks.  Each circle had lights and it was rotating in a circular motion or either the lights gave that illusion.  The three circles were in a V or triangular formation.   They hovered over my street for about 2-3 minutes then started to slowly move east.  The lead object started to move behind cloud coverage with the back two slowly following.  Once they were behind the clouds I could not see anymore.   At first I thought they were some kind of firework, but they were not, unless fireworks go up and never come down and move slowly to the east in a V formation.;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
