Oval 2 minutes green alone in SUV At the end of the Eclipse, I shot these pictures with my Samsung Galaxy Note 5. I was sitting in my SUV and held my phone out of the driver side window.  I did not notice anything strange, I was not looking at the sun when I shot these photos. I just looked at them to show my wife and noticed the green oval. It is not in my lens I took the bird picture right after I took the sun shots.  I don't know what the green oval is.;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
Three bright lights followed by a stream of colored vapor.;2020-05-01 20:12:00;8 min;Three bright lights followed by a stream of colored vapor. On May 1, 2020 at 8:12 PM I was looking out my bedroom window and decided to take a picture of the sunset. After taking the picture I noticed a white spot in the sky and when I zoomed in on my iPhone on it it looked very strange. I ran to get my Nikon zoom camera and took additional pictures of it and the picture shows three bright white lights followed by a very bright stream of light following it. It continued on a path of 291° west and eventually disappeared into the sunset.;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
Round/oval/disc shaped black craft in the eastern sky up and left of the moon;2020-11-29 17:40:00;20 minutes;Round/oval/disc shaped black craft in the eastern sky up and left of the moon November 29, 2020  Dear Trenz, hello, my name is Gary Ford. I am from Delray Beach Florida. At around 5:35 PM I had just arrived home from work and was taking my dog out to the backyard. It was still light out and the sky was getting darker but still pretty light out with the sun lighting the western sky up pink and orange. I looked out the east and the full moon was illuminated hanging in the pale blue sky. Like many evenings just before stars begin to come out I’d like to take my binoculars and try to find stars. But tonight a full moon hanging in the background I couldn’t resist grabbing my binoculars. As I lifted my binoculars towards the moon it just so happened that a passenger jet was flying northbound and I began to follow it. After I became disinterested I started to move my binoculars back towards the east and when doing so I noticed a oval than circular then flat shaped black object in the sky. At first I thought to myself, maybe there is a spiderweb in my binoculars vision as I was pairing from underneath our mango tree sitting down. But simply just by moving my binoculars around and standing up trying not to lose the object in my sites shaking wildly, I managed to keep my binoculars field of vision trained on the object. I sat back down Indian style and secured my elbows to my knees to keep from moving too much and stabilize myself. I thought to myself maybe this object is just a drone, or maybe some sort of balloon, as it shape continue to slowly change over time. But as I continue to watch for the 20 minutes I was trained on the object, I soon realized that it was more like a flat disc in the sky, and definitely really far away and much larger than I first thought it appeared to be. If I were to drop the binoculars down you could not see the object whatsoever because it was so far away and so high up in the sky. At one point it is actually tilted in such a way ! as to catch the sunlight. Being that it was the setting sun light it was more of an orange colored light and it reflected off the object for a moment making it appear more silver than black at this time. As I continue to watch it I began to think to myself is this thing ever going to do any maneuvers other than just seeming to rise higher and higher towards the very very high clouds that you get at the very top of the atmosphere. As a “rise so high that it was getting even harder to see what the binoculars it was at that moment that it literally just sped off out of you from left to right so fast it’s strict in my vision. I looked everywhere I could in the sky from the lowest horizon above the trees all the way back up and straight above me and all around the moon again but could not find the object it had just disappeared as to which I honestly think it just took off faster than anything I’ve ever seen before. I hate to use this description but it really did look like that object that the United States Air Force had released of that object that they followed that seem to do maneuvers that they never saw before. The video where the guy was saying look at that dude look at th! at dude! I hope that my description is taken seriously and it was very interesting to see and I feel privileged to have witnessed it. Thank you for your time if you have any questions you may contact me if there’s a place to put My contact info. Sincerely,  James Ford;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
