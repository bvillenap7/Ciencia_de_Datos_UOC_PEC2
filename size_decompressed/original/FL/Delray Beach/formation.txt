Strange cloud and small formation.   South Florida;2013-08-07 20:15:00;15 minutes;Strange cloud and small formation.   South Florida I first notice an anomaly in the night sky.  The sun had set on the western Horizon but it appeared as if there were a bright blue sky cut out of the darkened night sky.  The shape itself would mimic a large cloud.  Oddly you could see stars next to the blue hole in the sky.  I ran inside to grab my fiance and two other friends to come and see.  They were amazed for a few moments and then shook it off and started joking about my love for science and UFO's.  I was not expecting a UFO sighting, I just thought it was something cool for every one to see.  It is not the first sky anomaly I have witnessed here in South Fl.  The cloud shaped blue hole was slowly closing and turning a darker and darker blue.   As it did, I couldn't help but stare at it.  A bright light then appeared out the center of the darkening blue hole.  As it did (the only way I could describe it:  the ripple in a glass of water when touched or disturbed.)a ripple appeared (so fain! t to the eye I almost couldn't see it.)As the bright light got smaller, I could see two smaller lights moving with the larger light.  They started to flash simultaneously.  It lasted only a few seconds.  The main object seemed to grow in size and became bright enough to engulf the two smaller flashing lights.  And like turning off an old school television the light became small and just disappeared.  The blue cloud had become very small and was a very dark blue.;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
Lights moving in formation at high rates of speed;2014-09-30 22:30:00;15 seconds;Lights moving in formation at high rates of speed On Tuesday night I first saw five separate lights flying north to south in linear formation.  A couple of the lights flew erratically.  They were flying at extremely high altitudes at a very high rate of speed.  Thirty minutes later there was another formation, consisting of around 8 lights, which flew in a v formation.  There were a few lights in this formation that were also flying erratically.  Neither formation was perfect, each were clearly formed of individual craft.;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
Numerous lights either moving in formation, or as part of a larger UFO going south 1/2 mile west of the coastline in Delray Beach, FL;2014-11-11 19:30:00;10-15 seconds;Numerous lights either moving in formation, or as part of a larger UFO going south 1/2 mile west of the coastline in Delray Beach, FL My neighbor and I were in the hot tub and I noticed numerous objects (12) flying in a symmetrical formation (elongated hexagon) overhead at least 200+ feet above the ground... or they were all part of one much larger object.  I alerted her to it, and we could not identify what it could be other than some sort of UFO(s). It was dark clear night, and I could tell the objects were far too big to be birds.  They all had a hazy whitish light on their underside and were moving uniformly in the same direction (going due south) - which makes me believe it was all part of the same object as there looked like there could be an outline against the contrast of the stars in the sky.  Additionally, there was a noise overhead as they flew by that sounded like a jet engine... but much more subdued and muffled. Both my neighbor and I are professionals, and neither of us were drinking alcohol nor under the influence of any other substances at the time of this sighting.  Neither of us could tell what it was that we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
