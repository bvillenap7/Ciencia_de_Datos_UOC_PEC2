2 Fiery glowing objects over Delray Beach, FL;2009-12-21 18:00:00;10 min;2 Fiery glowing objects over Delray Beach, FL The evening of December 21st at around 6PM my friend and I returned from shopping and as I turned to unpack the car an object in the sky caught my attention because it was glowing as if on fire, sort of an orange glow. The object was a quarter the size of a full moon. I asked my friend to look and he said ya, what is it? I said its not a plane its flying too low and not making a sound to be a plane. We watched as it disapeared into the evening misty night. It went south fron the north right over our house. I went in the house started unpacking groceries and opened the back door to go outside to get my cat and another object in the sky caught my attention. This time it was lower to the ground so I could make out a faint shadow of an egg shaped object just above the firery glow. All this took place within 10 minutes, 5 minutes apart from each other. My friend came out when I called and he ran back inside the house to get his binoculars. He said yes it was defiantly fiery. It was traveling about the same speed on the same path as the previous object 5 minutes earlier. We watched until it disappeared into the hazy night sky.;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367

My 4 year old granddaughter and I were walking west in a parking lot at our local supemarket at the corner of 441 and Clintmore Road, Boca Raton, Florida at 7:40PM.  From the East coming towards our direction at approximately 200 feet in the distance swopped down a craft resembling an egg shape laying on its side.  As it came towards us it was approximately 100 feet in the air and 1/4 of it was lit in  a yellow tone light resembling a cock pit.  I noticed 4 shadowy figures moving within the craft cockpit which appeared VERY tall and slender with  long arms, and large heads.  Three were standing one was sitting. The craft itself was luminious resembling a flare one puts on top of a birthday cake.  It had deffinate shape and boundries where a flare on a cake does not.  It passed over head and made NO sound what so ever.  It was VERY fluid in motion, no jerks, no wobbling, and no sound. It glided approximately 150 feet straigt and stopped.  Simply stopped.  Stood there motionless for approximately 5 minutes and then shot directly up.  We watched the lit up craft go straight up till it became a pin prick size of light.  There were no stars in the sky but when i came out of the market the sky was lit with stars znd the smallest of the stars was approximately 3 times the size of the craft at its tiniest.  The craft had no head lites and it not leave a trail of light.  The fact that it was soundless and the fluidity of its motion and the way it just sat in the sky with no movement of any kind and than simply shot straight up till it became a pinpoint of light.  I don't recall the moon being out at the time for size comparison however it did not appear overly large as it flew over head perhaps 50 feet across.  The windshield was free of divisions and was 1/4 of the crafts size.  There were two other woman observing both unknown to me one  who took a phone picture as the craft hovered.  The older woman was approximately 50 years of age and was with her daughter who appeared to be in her mid to late 30's both were strangers to me.  I called the Boca Raton Police the next day who appeared uninterested and didn't even take a report.  I than searched the web and reported it to you, I also called at the time and left a message.;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367

It looked like it had fire inside of it from the front.  There were no lights on it besides the fire from the front.  It was flying lower than an airplane with no noise and was too fast to be a Chinese lantern.  Then after a few seconds, an identical orange orb flew across the sky in the same path.;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
