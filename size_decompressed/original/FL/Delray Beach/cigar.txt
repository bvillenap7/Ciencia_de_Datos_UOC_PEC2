Bright, rectangular shaped object over the Atlantic Ocean, in Delray Beach, FL.;2016-02-27 15:30:00;45 minutes;Bright, rectangular shaped object over the Atlantic Ocean, in Delray Beach, FL. I was at the public beach in Delray ( north end).  I was admiring the beautiful cloud formations when I noticed a very bright object, rectangle or oblong in the south east sky.  It was too far for me to see the details.  I first thought it was a reflection of the sun on a cloud but it didn't move when the clouds did.   After about ten minutes, I didn't notice it there.  Then after about ten more minutes, I saw it again, more directly east, it was stationary and was about 30 degrees above the horizon.  (I am not good at knowing degrees, so I am guessing but you can observe it from my photos). There was a boat out in the ocean that looked as it may have been trying to go towards the object, I presume for curiosity sake.  Then a small plane and two helicopters flew around above us at the beach. The black helicopter was  hovering over the ocean, then moved over the beach (going east to west , yet sideways????), most likely trying to photograph it from a distance????  Not sure.  Very odd to hear the two copters and a small plane at the same time in the same area.... I decided to take photos with my iPhone to document it, as it was not a usual sighting.  Maybe it was a weather balloon? It was just odd....so bright -enough to stand out.  It did not scoot around...but did go from south east to east within the 45 minutes I observed it, and it had disappeared during the location transition. The object was still there when I left.  I am curious as to know what it may have been, any light you can shed would be appreciated.;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
