Circular Blue Object Shoots into Black hole;2007-12-12 23:00:00;5 seconds;Circular Blue Object Shoots into Black hole It was a circular bright blue object, it looked as though it was stationary then as I looked at it a second more it shot straight into the night sky and disapeared...It was as though it disappeared into a black hole or something. I saw one object...it was not a plane, and it wasnt a shooting star. It was Flying lower than a regular plane, and higher than the tree tops over the North East side near the ocean.;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367

Circular round lights the color of a flame moving in the sky above Delray Beach, FL mid-night 12/29/12;2012-09-30 00:00:00;5 minutes;Circular round lights the color of a flame moving in the sky above Delray Beach, FL mid-night 12/29/12 We were leaving the movie theater in Delray Beach, Florida along U.S. highway 1 around mid-night on Sat. Sept. 29, 2012 when we notice a number of people in the parking lot looking up at the night sky and some were apparently attempting to video what the saw on their phone cameras.  When I looked up with my son, I could see about 6 small (although apparently distant) light orange (color of a lighter flame maybe slightly darker) colored round or sperical objects at an attitude of about 10-11 o'clock looking West to East.  As there were Royal palm trees in the parking lot as well as light inh my vision was a time obstructed although I could hear other people saying the saw as many as eight or more lights.  Personally,  I only could see at most six lights at one point and at times as few as only two as the others were obstructed by palms, etc.  They did not move together in any sort of pattern but appeared rather to move in all different seemingly random directions! ...sometimes fast and at other times slow...sometimes closer together and at other times moving away from each other.  Saw a group of two at one point move off together but then split in radically different directions.  Considered maybe they could be jet afterburners at first (seen at a distance) but the irratic movement, time of night, and the more orange color just didn't seem to fit.  Objects appeared small but distant so I do not believe any accurate estimate of actual size can be given. As to speed...well that would depend on size and distance which I could not attempt to estimate but I would guess it was faster than a one engine plane at all times.  As our viewing locating was less than one mile from the Atlantic Ocean coast, the objects could have been traveling immediately above the coastline, in general. Due to the late hour, my son and I left the scene and when into Appleby's Restaurant so we did not spend more than five minutes viewing the event.  As far as I know! , the event continued as the objects were not moving in any on! e direct ion at any constant speed...other spectators continued to watch.  Did not see anything in the news or in response to internet search, so I decided to post and see if it would act as a catalyst for other people to report the event.;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
Glowing CD shaped saucer flying NW, slowly floating off into the night.;2017-07-20 00:40:00;10 seconds;glowing CD shaped saucer flying NW, slowly floating off into the night. At 12:40 am, i look in the night sky and i see what i thought was maybe a balloon or plastic bag.  it appeared to be moving rather slow.  almost floating.  Moving north-west.  it looked like a glowing white CD. very faint. flew off into the night and disappeared into the distance just like a plane would.  Insane!!!  tried capturing it on camera but my crappy phone wouldn't pick up the faint glow of the saucer. second sighting for me.  first was in 2014.;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
