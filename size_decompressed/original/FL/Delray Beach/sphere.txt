Turned abruptly south and at a high rate of speed.  I viewed it traveling in a straight line towards the horizon as it became to small to view and left my sight.  I viewed this object passing behind a tall communication antenna in the foreground and the perspective of tremendous speed was visually confirmed by the objects decreasing size as it travelled away from view.  Description was round in shape and shiny reflecting the same color of the sun at that time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Globe shaped object flashing lights at random another blue light behind Stationary;2012-09-07 05:30:00;1 hr +;Globe shaped object flashing lights at random another blue light behind Stationary Saw flashing lights in sky.  The front looked like a globe covered in changing lights and behind it was a single light blue in color.  I looked at it for a little more than a half hour and no movement. Went back out 20 mins later still stationary.  I wish I had a telescope but had to make due with binoculars. At first I thought weather ballon, or a blimp but the colors were a amazing and flashed over the whole globe by segments.  Very bright lights.;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
