We got close to the light and still the light didnt move.We pulled off the side of the road.It was a little to the West of us.Then the light slowly turned towards our car.I wanted to hear it so I shut off the car and headlights then the light was about over us it turned SW.It was a perfect Triangle. It was black with NO Noise.It had the bright light in the front and 2 red solid lights in the back corners.It was moving very slow.My son got scared so we left.;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367

bright, orange triangle in the sky;2011-01-11 06:03:00;1 hour;bright, orange triangle in the sky I saw a very bright, well defined triangle that was hovering. It never moved. At first there was only one, then two others joined it.  It was a very, very bright orange triangle and there seemed to be rays coming from it, like the sun (but it was NOT the sun).  The other two shone just as brightly. They were there for about 40-60 minutes.  The morning was very misty, you couldn't see anything else and yet this was outlined perfectly, very clear and the mist didn't touch it.  I have no idea what it was, at first I thought it was a metor, but now I'm sure it's a UFO.  Whatever it was, I have never seen it before and I don't believe that it was anything of this earth, therefor I can only think that's it's a UFO.;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
Very large, slow moving triangle;2011-10-28 11:00:00;1 hour;very large, slow moving triangle I saw a very, very large triangle (it was bigger then a house).  Three lights, one on each corner. It was moving very slowly, it took almost an hour for it to move off.  I do not know if anyone else saw it.  It was black in color and blocked the stars.  It did not make any noise.;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
