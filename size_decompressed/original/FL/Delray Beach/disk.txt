Saucer with white gassy bottom approaches beachgoers at night and zips in, and zips away...silently.;1986-03-15 00:00:00;15 minutes;Saucer with white gassy bottom approaches beachgoers at night and zips in, and zips away...silently. Me and my friend were sitting on the beach outside a Reggae club we liked to go to, it was late at night.  I'm pretty sure it was around Delray Beach.  Either that or somewhere from Ft. Lauderdale to Delray Beach, which was where we hung out. We hadn't been drinking heavily.  We were looking out over the ocean and saw this strange light pretty far off in the sky.  We remarked on how unusual it looked and then we saw it zip around very fast at sharp angles, and come closer to us.   I know this will sound strange but it was as if it had tuned in to our thoughts.  I say this because it zipped pretty close to us and we got a real good look at it from underneath. It was shaped kind of like a cake, or maybe a Fedora style hat and where the head-hole would be there was a pearly light but kind of gassy and ethereal is the best way I can describe it.  I say gassy because it was like looking into dry ice at a concert.  We looked at it for a minute up close like that and were talking about how cool it was but not wanting to get excited and scare it away, and another guy, rather drunk, came up behind us and shouted hey what are you looking at, and it zipped away and out of sight.  THERE WAS NO SOUND. It happened so long ago, it's strange to try to recount.  It is hard to believe it was real.  But it was, I know what I saw.  Me and my friend lost touch a long time ago, but I did see a special on TV once about some UFO's seen in Florida by many people including law enforcement, like Sarasota or Jupiter Beach or something, and the pictures they showed that the people had taken, some of the pictures were of exactly what we saw.  That's my story. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367

Daytime Siteing of three white discs over Delray Beach, Florida;2006-08-05 20:43:00;2 mins;Daytime Siteing of three white discs over Delray Beach, Florida I had just left work in the Los Verdes condos where my work is and I was sitting at the traffic light at Military Trail and I just glanced to the northwest of my location towards Atlantic Blvd and there they were three white discs moving very slow towards the west and were maybe a mile up in the sky away from my position. it was about 4:43PM on Aug 5, 2006  The first one was ahead of the other 2 that were near each other and they were silent and moved in like a floating pattern (Not a straght line) Like up and down and a kinda wobble like free floating.  I could see them clear as day and I pointed up to the sky and the people in the car behind me also got out and looked at them.  The sighting lasted about 2 mins and as soon as they got my 9:00 position they blended into the sky (just disappeared).  I have seen alot of strange objects in the night sky but this is my first Daytime sighting and these were absolutly real!  I stopped to talk to some people down the street and they said they have been seeing Strange Objects at night over this area.;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
