Single white light changes to multiple sources with red light, splits up. Red light moves differently and sparkle type exhaust noticed.;1997-04-25 01:45:00;5 minutes;Single white light changes to multiple sources with red light, splits up. Red light moves differently and sparkle type exhaust noticed. Early Friday Morning 4/25/97 at approximately 1:45 AM (worked late) I was traveling north on Military Trail between Atlantic and Lake Ida Road. I noticed a rather large white light, like a helicopter spot light in the north sky. Then I suddenly noticed a red  light below it. The red light looked like a tower light at first. Then I noticed that it was much wider than a single tower light.  I turned east on Lake Ida road and was alternately watching the road and looking north (to my left) at the lights. The red light was now rectangular in shape and there was some small areas where there was maybe white light by the red.  Then the Large white source became 4 blinking smaller white lights, like 2 lights each on the wing tips of an airplane. The white lights flew to the south above me and then I couldn't find them. The red light started moving rather rapidly to the east. Then I noticed red sparkles horizontally behind  the red light. The sparkles were like fireworks sparkles. The sparkles became a streak and the red light continued moving east very fast and became very small. The sparkles disappeared. The red light became indistinguishable from a star or ordinary airplane light and kept moving east until I couldn't spot it anymore.  When this happened 4/25/97 I documented it and emailed to family.  I just found your web site June 29, 2012 when I saw another strange set of objects and reported them and then report this 1997 incident.;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
Bright white light hovering high above the ground, suddenly dissappeared.;2005-03-10 15:00:00;1 minute;Bright white light hovering high above the ground, suddenly dissappeared. While driving down a strait 1 lane road in the middle of the day with not a cloud in the sky I saw a glowing orb. Extremely white in nature, more white than anything I have seen.  I studied the object for about 20 seconds trying to determine if it was just a plane or helicopter or even a star but the object seemed to be not moving in anyway and did not have flashing lights.  It appeared to just be a white orb from the distance I was viewing from although could have had a more physical nature if seen from closer I presume. I watched the object for about 20 seconds then pointed it out to a friend I was driving with.  Who at first said he thought it was a plane. I said look again, does that look like a plane?  Is it moving?  What shape is it?   He proceeded to say what the hell is that thing? We both just stared at it for as long as we could while driving up this strait road but there were large pine type trees that obscured our view of the object for about 7 seconds.  Immediately after passing the point where it would be obscured, the object was gone.. vanished. I did not see it fly away or land or anything it was just gone.  From where this thing was and the clear nature of the sky there is no way if it was a plane or helicopter that it could of flown far enough that I could not see it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
Bright Lite moving in different directions;2006-05-14 00:30:00;1-3 mins;Bright Lite moving in different directions I noticed another report in Miami very similar to what I saw so I decided to add my report as well but My spotting time was around Dusk 8:30PM or 00:30 UTC.   On Sunday Evening around 8:30PM or 00:30 UTC Time It was dusk and I was outside looking at Military Jets Flying around and then I noticed a Bright light caught my attention in the eastern sky and it was moving slowly towards the West. The light got dim as it got closer and seemed to slow down then it disappeared for about 20 seconds when I noticed it again as a faint glow but this time it was moving back in the opposite direction and it got brighter as it picked up speed. It disappeared in a matter of seconds heading back to the East and I thought this was strange. After a few minutes I noticed a another Military Jet Flying around at a very high attitude Flying towards where the light came from and how I know they were Military Jets because they have just one blinking Red light you can see from the rear after they fly past and you can hear them. After the 911 attacks I saw those same Jets flying in our skies so I'm sure they were Military. I heard them fly over this area all night long. Also earlier in the evening a Military Jet did a low swoop over this area and headed straight up and it was so loud it shook the house and my neighbors came out to look as well.;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
Objects sighted over Delray Beach Florida;2006-06-18 01:20:00;2 mins;Objects sighted over Delray Beach Florida I have seen another Strange Object in the night sky. As I reported earlier I saw a strange Glowing object that as its speed slowed it got dim then I lost sight of it for 20 seconds then it reappeared again heading back to the east back on 5/14/06  Well tonight 6/18/06 I saw a Pulsating object the same dimness as the last 2 times just above me moving east and it slow pulsated about 3-4 times then went black about 5 seconds later I saw it pulsate again once lower in the sky then a few seconds later another pulse once but this time it was way to the south of where I saw it last. It seemed to have a haze around it not real clear. This is the third Sunday I saw this objects and I compare the brightness to a dim light bulb.  About 1 minute later there were two streaks across the sky. A bright object with a trail to the west of me then I saw another one way out to the east both went in a south direction.  I have noticed that I see this objects on Sundays?  This is the third Sunday I saw this objects and I compare the brightness to a dim light bulb.  I didn't report the second sighting on 5/21/06 about 9:20 PM EST or 01:20UTC and I'm almost sure it’s the same object that I have been seeing. I don’t have a video camera to record these objects but anyone reading this if your near the Boca-Delray Beach Florida area watch the sky to the east on Sundays between 9:00-10:00PM and you may be lucky enough to capture these objects on tape. They move around to fast for a Camera.  I have not seen any other objects except Sunday Night and I think there is a Pattern to look at here. I have looked every Sunday since the first time but some Sundays were cloudy.  I look at the sky every night and these were not a satellite or plane I know what they look like and how they move. Also these objects are totaly silent.  There was a small private plane nearby this time and I wonder if anyone in the plane maybe saw or reported something?  I have seen alot of objects in the sky before but these are real objects from elsewhere besides the 2 sightings I had as a kid in the 1970's. That’s all the info I have but strange that I have seen this 3 times and all on Sundays. I’ll keep watching. Thanks ((initials deleted));26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
Five to12 celestial bodies flashing side to side (left to right) red, blue, blue/green, white.  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling stars?? PD));2006-08-24 04:30:00;hours;Five to twelve celestial bodies flashing side to side (left to right) red, blue, blue/green, white I have lived in Florida since 1992.  Very close to the water south east coast.  For years I have seen what I would always rationalize as stars.  The image of flashing bodies of light all of which emit whit, red, green/blue flashes in each body.  I am familiar with Jupiter and some of the other mention of celestial bodies that do this, however cannot find any documentation on the reports that I reviewed concerning the area of the south east coast of Florida.  They can be seen in a clear sky and watching them at length of one to three hours they sometimes deminish and sometimes do not.  The have no speeding movement however do have a formation.  such as that one body forming an iscosoles (sp) triangle, semi circle bowl shape or two triangles, and also by connecting dots.  I have seen them form a wave like the 'approximately' sign on a typewriter key.  On several occasions laying on my back on the beach there are clusters of them up to the number of single lights, 12 forming all the designs I have mentioned.  They are completely well defined as still compared to moving air craft, as I mentioned before they move quite slowly when they deminish as they are moving what appears to be away from me, or are easily shrouded by cloud cover but remain after the cloud is gone.  All of them do sparkle as you have described as 'light hitting a diamond'.   The colors are all the same with my eye anyway, red, green, green/blue white.  they do flash however side to side.  They do not have a starburst effect.  They are easily seen with binoculars and the flash is side to side on all of them.  (At one time there were five people  with me a few years back as I brought it up to discussion and we planed the night watch and we were not disappointed. Three of the five have knowlege of constellations and none could not explain what we were seeing.  This early morning my interest was sparked again walking my dog, there were five in a bowl shape formation each one from finger to finger viewing about 5 inches apart, all flashing as I have described.  I know it is florida and was wondering are these weather satellites, communication sattelites?  Or a larger perspective view of constellation formations that due to the etherial conditions of air, heat, gasses that they flash like this;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367

Pulsing silent &quotultra bright light&quot in the east skies of Delray Beach;2013-05-20 21:35:00;2 minutes;Pulsing silent &quotultra bright light&quot in the east skies of Delray Beach At about 9'ish I went outside on my balcony and noticed a bright pulsing light next to the radio tower.  It was as bright as a phosphorus burn, a white light and it pulsed.  I live on a lake, the lights from the tower form a reflection that is a line of light on the lake.  (1) aircraft pulsing red light and (1) light that is on full time.  The white light pulsed next to it for about 2 minutes.   I got my camera and it was full!  (I left it on after the storms and it recorded itself out) I missed the video...  The light lit up a reflection on the lake that was a wider more intense beam than the radio towers and I am sure it was not an aircraft.  If the light was from an aircraft at that altitude and shining that reflection, it would have hit my apartment.  When I got the camera ready and the light into frame it just vanished.  Its altitude was less than 300 feet.  It was silent.  It was close enough to light up my lake same as the radio tower.  It was about 1.5 miles from my location.  At 9:38 it was gone.  I came in off the balcony.;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367

Two bright white lights in daylight over south Florida.;2014-05-31 09:00:00;40 minutes;Two bright white lights in daylight over south florida Western sky  approx  280 degrees,at 50 degrees from horizon.  Two stationary circular bright lights approx 5-7degrees apart.  Slowly moved north over a 40 min period to approximate 310 degrees but lights never increased or decreased their separation distance. Upper level and ground winds were from the exact opposite direction of movement and lights did not appear to be a drift. Lights finally became obscured by high ceiling wispy clouds and gone when clear view available;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367

South Florida:  10-15 random lights appeared as stars moving at slow to very fast speeds at high altitudes.  ((anonymous report));2018-11-18 19:30:00;10 minutes;South Florida: 10-15 random lights appeared as stars moving at slow to very fast speeds at high altitudes While walking my dogs at about 7:30pm, I looked up in the sky to notice a bunch of bright “stars.”  Normally I don't see as many, due to the amount of lights on the ground in south Florida.  (lights usually reflect on the atmosphere making it more difficult to see stars.)   When I stopped to see the “stars,” I noticed there were about 10-15 that were actually moving at different speeds and sometimes slowing and speeding up.  There was a random group, no formation like you would expect for planes or other aircraft.  I felt spooked after watching for about 5 minutes, so I ran in to get my fiancé to take a look so I didn’t think I was seeing things.  She witnessed the same strange siting, and also got spooked and ran in the house.   The lights seemed at a very high altitude and appeared to look like stars.  As the view became blocked, I moved between trees to notice the lights moving at a much faster speed toward the western horizon.  Still maintaining a random formation.  There’s no way they could be aircraft of any type to be that many and to move at that rate of slow speed to high speed and cover that much distance in about a minute or less.  There were no light trails of any sort.  Just a formation of random “star” looking lights moving very strangely. There was no ability to determine a shape of objects due to the distance and altitude they seemed to be at.   I’ve watch a lot of aircraft in the past, in the night skies, and this was definitely much different.  I even noticed actual aircraft in the skies during and after the siting and nothing moved like these 10-15 lights I witnessed.  It would have been difficult for anyone to notice unless you were looking up at stars and noticed the moving lights, they easily blended in with the night sky.  Very strange but interesting experience. (NUFORC Note:  itness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
