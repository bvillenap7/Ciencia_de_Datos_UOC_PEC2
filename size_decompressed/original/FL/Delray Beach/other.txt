It began to shimmer green, then red, then white again as it slowly moved across the sky towards the North, it stopped and hovered for a moment then moved southward. It repeated this movement a few more times then instantly disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.

Huge, boomerang shaped, unlit object flying over the cirrus clouds, N to S over Delray Beach, FL, 2 witnesses;2012-11-07 19:30:00;45-60 seconds;Huge, boomerang shaped, unlit object flying over the cirrus clouds, N to S over Delray Beach, FL, 2 witnesses Date:  11/7/2012 Time: approximately 7:30 to 7:40 pm Location: Delray Beach, Florida   We walked out of our condo to go for a short walk.  Looked up into the sky to check out the stars.  I observed a huge, boomerang shaped object moving from North to South.  I pointed it out to my friend. At first, I thought that it was a formation of birds since the shape was somewhat of a Vee, but with rounded edges.  However, it was dark and birds donâ€™t usually fly in formation, at night. There were no visible lights on the object.  It moved silently, high above the cirrus clouds which were at a very high altitude. Commercial airline traffic was in the air, at much lower altitudes.  These aircraft were dwarfed by the object that we observed. We were amazed at the size of this flying object or formation.  It moved at a very high speed and, within 45 to 60 seconds it could no longer be seen.;26.4544988721805;-80.1130078947367
