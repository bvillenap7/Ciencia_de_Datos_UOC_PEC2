Then as we were watching it move 2 more red oval crafts traveling very close together and appearing to follow the other red oval craft.  There was no sound and the 2 oval crafts were not traveling in a straight pattern.  We watched the first red oval disappear into the sky and then the other 2 were visible for another minute or so.;28.0450999999999;-82.6880000000001
Rose colored oval object in photo.;2013-06-02 18:00:00;10 minutes;rose colored oval object in photo. At dinner time at work I generally take photos of the Florida sunsets.  This night it was particularly bright and even blinding.  So I could not directly look at it to take the shot.   With my phone cam I stuck my arm up out of my car window and snapped a shot.  I was surprised to see that a single rose colored oval object was in the photo and rays beamed from the sun.  So I took a second picture and this time there showed a con trail and the object was gone.  Weather conditions were overcast.  A slight rain before.  If it is an optical illusion I am sorry for wasting your time.  I just wanted a professional to observe it.  Thank you in advance for your time and trouble.  Please do not release photos without my permission.  Thank you.;28.0450999999999;-82.6880000000001
