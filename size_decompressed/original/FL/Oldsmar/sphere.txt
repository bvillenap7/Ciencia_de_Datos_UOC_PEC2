Strange cream colored sphere that changed from looking like deflated balloon to hard white glass.;2016-11-24 18:30:00;5 minutes;Strange cream colored sphere that changed from looking like deflated balloon to hard white glass. This was not truly an UFO as I did not see it fly.  What happened was that my dog noticed and went to sniff this dull cream colored sphere that looked like a deflated balloon sitting on the mulch near my front door.  My dog took one sniff and left it alone.   It was about 5-6 diameter and some crazy reason I had to go and reach out to it.  As soon as I was about to touch it, it changed to look like a white opalescent glass globe, kind you see on top of the decorative neighborhood light posts (like in my neighborhood), but half the size.   I put my hand on it and it felt just like glass.  I tried to move it as it was obviously in wrong place but I was unable to shift it.  It was like welded to the ground.  I was thinking how peculiar place they have put the light as there was nothing pretty about the mulch.  The lights were not on yet on the street lights. About an hour later I took my dog out again and the sphere was gone.  Not only was it gone but there was nothing showing on the mulch or the ground that the sphere had been there.   I was alone in the building this Thanksgiving day so I could not ask anyone if they had seen it too.

Blue orb appears on the photos of the moon.  ((NUFORC Note:  Lens flare.  PD));2016-12-09 21:39:00;4 minutes;Blue orb appears on the photos of the moon. I was walking my dog on the very clear evening. I was admiring the very bright partial moon and after taking my dog back in, I got outside to take some pictures of the moon. I used my Apple 6S phone camera and took 10 pictures.  In two of them, I got my finger on a way of the lens but you can still see the orb, one seems to be a mistake picture of streetlight, and couple of the pictures are without zoom and don't show anything odd in them. But in those pictures I took with a zoom you can see a blue round object flying this way and that in my photos. With the camera having the feature that when you take a still shot it gives you first c. half second live movement. With this feature it is easy to see from which direction the object flies from right at the time when I take the photo and the speed of it. It is interesting that I did not see any orb or object in the sky while looking up, but I did notice the blue dot after taking a picture but I thought it was a reflection from something. That is why I took so many picture trying to get one without the blue dot. Also you can see a halo around the object, faint version of the moon's.;28.0450999999999;-82.6880000000001
