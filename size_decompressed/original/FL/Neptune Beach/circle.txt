Very small, circular object almost like a star. moving very fast, too fast and too small to be a plane and didnt have blinking lights like as plane. it was a blue-ish white color headed South from neptune beach, florida then back north, in a circular orbit, then out of site. We believe it might be a UFO, do you possibly have an explanation for this?;30.3155;-81.3989
