bright to dim light, with three smaller lights coming down..;2004-11-05 01:00:00;one minute;bright to dim light, with three smaller lights coming down.. We saw a bright light, looked like a star.  It dimmed and then got brighter slowly for a few seconds.  Then three red/Orange lights in a triangle shape came down from it slightly (about 5x it's heighth)Then we went to the front yard to get a better look.  The red/Orange lights were no longer there, but the bright light continued to dim and brighten.  It began to blink and then move about the sky in a swinging motion.  Suddenly it just disappeared.  I have no idea what that could have been, but I've never seen anything like it.  It was really weird and the whole thing lasted about 1 minute.  I've continued to look for it for a while, but haven't seen anything.  I've never been interested in this sort of thing, but now it is hard to ignore.;28.8851043478261;-81.309352173913
In daylight, oval object traveled across sky from west to east flashing a red light at irregular intervals - Volusia County, FL.;2015-01-02 17:00:00;3 minutes;In daylight, oval object traveled across sky from west to east flashing a red light at irregular intervals - Volusia County, FL. On January 2, 2014, we were at Gemini Springs Park in Deltona, FL.  Still full daylight, at about 5:00 pm, we saw an oval-shaped object high in the sky, traveling at a moderate steady speed, in a direction from west to east.   The object was in view for at least three minutes, as it traversed the sky.   Although difficult to say what color it was (possibly tan or orange?), it clearly emitted a bright red light every few seconds, but sporadically, not at regular intervals.;28.8851043478261;-81.309352173913
Yellow oval object seen by two people in DeBary, Florida.;2015-02-21 07:15:00;2 minutes;Yellow oval object seen by two people in DeBary, Florida. It was a large oval shaped object with flashing yellow & red lights moving from the east to north direction.  It was about 400-500 feet off the ground traveling much slower than a plain.  We first saw it to the right of some trees then it traveled behind them coming out the other side for  a few seconds, and then it was gone.;28.8851043478261;-81.309352173913
