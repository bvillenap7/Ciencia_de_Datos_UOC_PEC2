Orange Spheres Observed Over Volusioa County Florida.;2012-12-31 20:45:00;10-15 minutes;Orange Spheres Observed Over Volusioa County Florida Around 20:45 myself and several family members had gathered on our patio to watch New Years Eve fireworks displays going on in our area.  Several of us noticed one orange colored sphere that we assumed was an errant firework.  A few minutes later we noticed another sphere of the same color moving at the same speed and direction as the previous. We continued monitoring the sphere, and tracked it traveling due north where it either disappeared or faded into the sky.  At the time the moon was very low on the horizon and this was a rural area so it was very dark, without much light pollution, these objects were easy to follow. These orange spheres continued showing up for the next ten minutes, coming from due south or south southeast and traveling due north.  Usually the objects appeared in pairs, one object coming from due south, the other south southeast.  They appeared to be moving very fast. The objects were completely orange in color and had no noticeable navigation lights that would be expected of aircraft.  There were however, several aircraft in the area with navigation lights.  The orange spheres appeared to be lower in the sky than the other observable aircraft, but made no noise.  The objects left no vapor trail. We noticed a total of ten of these spheres before they stopped showing up.  I do not know if there may have been more in the sky before we noticed them.  Additionally myself and one other person noticed a very quick and faint white flash occurring shortly after each sphere disappeared into the skies to the north.  However, several others did not notice this.;28.8851043478261;-81.309352173913
