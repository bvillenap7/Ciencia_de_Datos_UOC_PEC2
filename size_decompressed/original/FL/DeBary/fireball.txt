Round slow moving ball at 9 pm.;2013-03-02 21:00:00;3 minutes;Round slow moving ball at 9pm. At 9:00pm I got a call from my friend that lives 2 blocks over from me.  I stepped outside to whitmess a round fireball moving slowly across the sky.  The object was moving north to south and was a orange and red ball and it appeared to have flames trailing behind.  It moved at in lateral direction and made no sound. It did not appear to be very high in the sky maybe 500 feet at the most.  We get a lot of planes and helicopters through here and it was nothing like that.  This was a slow moving ball. After about 20 seconds it turned east and then in about 3-4 seconds it was gone.;28.8851043478261;-81.309352173913
