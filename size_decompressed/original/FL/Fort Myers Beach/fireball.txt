The;2015-11-25 23:00:00;2 minutes;We noticed a large orange light gliding slowly in the sky, then a helicopter or other object flew toward it almost to fend it off.  The object then slowly moved toward the ocean sky and then in 1 second it was gone.  15 minutes later I was explaining to someone and as I was pointing to the spot in the sky a large bright light like a falling star fell from the sky straight down.
