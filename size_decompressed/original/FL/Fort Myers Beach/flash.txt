I was driving on Lovers Key State Park towards Fort Myers Beach when I saw a brilliant green flash towards the Gulf of Mexico.  The sky was very cloudy which made it seem odd due to level of brightness.   When I got home I looked up and saw the planes flying to RSW were below the cloud cover, so it was very high clouds last night.  A brilliant jade green light had to be miles in diameter.
