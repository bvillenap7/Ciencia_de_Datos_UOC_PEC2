2 pink-orange spheres floating over Fort Myers Beach.;2013-05-27 20:55:00;1 minute;2 pink-orange spheres floating over Fort Myers Beach My family and I were sitting on the lanai of our Fort Myers Beach Condo at around 8:55 p.m. We were looking out over the ocean when we saw a pink-orange sphere floating over the ocean in a particular course.  There was no noise and the wind did not seem to be effecting it. It seemed to flicker and at one pont it stopped and gradually disappeared.  After it disappeared, another one followed the same path and took the same course.;26.4556;-81.9501
