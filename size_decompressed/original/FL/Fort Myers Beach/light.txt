It appeared to be at 8 to 10,000 feet. I thought that it may be a helecopter but the light was not flashing like on a plane.  We watched until it was overhead, then it stopped for a moment and went straight up until it disappeared. I saw the shuttle go up and this was about 2 to 3 times faster.  My wife can attest to the fact!;26.4556;-81.9501
Orange floating light.  No engine sound, above Fort Myers shoreline.;2013-07-19 22:00:00;6 minutes;orange floating light, no engine sound, above Fort Myers shoreline. An orange light appeared over the dark horizon.  It seemed to float slowly & silently towards me (south from whence it began).   The shape was an irregular orange light, unsharp around the edges, about 700ft above the shoreline.   As it approached, it became a little smaller, but clearer, flickered a little before fading out in its then stationary position.;26.4556;-81.9501
