Sept. 1998 Ft. Myers, Fla.  Triangular w/lights   3-5 mins.   NO SOUND;1998-09-01 22:00:00;3-5 mins.;Sept. 1998 Ft. Myers, Fla.  Triangular w/lights   3-5 mins.   NO SOUND Having never talked about this before, except to few close friends. My wife and I were on a gambling ship off the Ft. Myers, Florida coast at night,in Sept. 1998. Not being much of gamblers, we went up on the top deck. After about one hour of standing on deck, my wife quietly said, in utter shock, to look begind you. I turned around and there were 3 triangular shaped UFO's in formation, approximately 500 ft. away. 2 were on the bottom, one hovering above these, forming one huge triangle.(Overall size of each object was approximately 50x50x50 ft.) They each had red lights that remained constant, around the perimeter of each triangle. They also were sloped backward in position, approx. 10 degrees. As we stared in disbelief, they made no movement OR sound. After about 3-5 mins., they all traveled back and away in unison, again no sound. All these years we have felt that our military has some real advanced technology, OR maybe they don't. Having been priviledged to witness such an event, we have only recently heard through media of similar objects like these. Not knowing anybodies reaction to our story, we kind of chuckle to each other that we have been fortunate to have seen and believe.
