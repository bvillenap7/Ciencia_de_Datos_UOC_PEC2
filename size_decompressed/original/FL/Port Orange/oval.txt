Vano Pecchio, a longtime local photographer for more than 30 years, was taking architectural images of a home for glossy publication in a book.  His photos were two-second explsures, by a Cannon 5D 14 mm 2.8 lens, 7.0 aperture ISO 200, manual mode, medium resolution 4,080 pixels.  He took 11 frames in 90 seconds.  Nine of the frames have a perfectly clear sky.  Frame 287 has an unidentified object in the sky.  When blown up, it's clearly an object, but not of anything in nature.  Frame 288 has a smaller image, further away, and in the other frames it was gone.;29.1383434911242;-81.0096041420116
