Hovering lights, apparently a helicopter, with very dim lights and no discernible sound.;2013-03-12 22:00:00;~30 seconds;Hovering lights, apparently a helicopter, with very dim lights and no discernible sound. I saw a strange set of lights which seemed to be hovering over Dunlawton Avenue near the intersection of Clyde Morris Blvd.  I was driving west on Dunlawton.  I saw them above and in front of me.  They drew my attention because they seemed unusually dim for an aircraft that apparently low. I first tried to determine if the apparent lack of motion was because the craft was moving away or coming toward me, but  I drove under it without it seeming to move. As I drove under, I lowered my window and listened for the sounds of the engine or rotors of what I assumed at that point was a helicopter.  I couldn't hear anything over the street sounds of the traffic on the road.  I lost sight of the lights as I continued to drive west. The night sky was cloudy.  The lights were muted, about 4or 5 of them, white and blue I think.  The altitude of the lights was such that I could see the lights clearly, but not the craft they were on. My best w.a.g. is 1000 feet or so. This may be nothing unusual. I just wanted to report it in case it corroborates a better report of the same object.;29.1383434911242;-81.0096041420116

I was in an open area off of Dunlawton Avenue, two miles West of the Dunlawton Bridge.  The objects had no lights and were moving fast.  They were in very close proximity to each other, flying in tandem, one in front of the other.  The one in back then flew above the one in front and they both continued at equal distance and speed.

The sky was already pretty dark, so I couldn't make out its exact shape, however, it had a very bright light visible, so much so, that it was far too bright to be a star or a planet, and it was almost completely stationary but was otherwise sinking very slowly into the west.   I contacted the sheriff's office to inquire whether their chopper was out tonight and was told that it was not.   I was eventually redirected to the UFO hot line, where I stated my case on the answering machine and then came to report the incident here.;29.1383434911242;-81.0096041420116
