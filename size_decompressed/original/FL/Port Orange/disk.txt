A metallic saucer shape with two protrusions from the bottom was seen while driving East on Dunlawton Avenue between the crossroads of Nova Road and Ridgewood Avenue (US1).  It was seen for approximately 30 seconds.  It moved from a east northeast position in the sky to a position nearly overhead,  at which time we lost visual contact.  We waited for the object to reappear in the southern sky, after it was blocked from view from the roof of the car, but it never reappeared.  The object was approximately 8-10 feet in diameter, object was approximately a half mile away when first seen and at about 1000 ft. The area in which this object was sited was within controlled airspace (Class C) from Daytona Beach International Airport.  This airspace is radar controlled and an object at that altitude and distance should have produced a radar return.;29.1383434911242;-81.0096041420116
Three red disks flying from west to east in a staggered formation, spanning the sky in five seconds at a high altitude.;2003-10-09 21:30:00;5 Seconds;Three red disks flying from west to east in a staggered formation, spanning the sky in five seconds at a high altitude. My father and I were sitting on the back deck of his mobile home.  We were looking up at the sky, basically because it's so dark there and the stars are so bright.  Suddenly, out of the west, three disk shaped bright red objects entered the western horizon and within five seconds they spanned the entire sky into the eastern horizon.  They flew in a staggered formation at an extremely high altitude.  I'm very familiar with all military jets, especially stealth aircraft and I've never seen anything like this.  I'm 53 and have served two tours of duty in Vietnam as a Civil Affairs Specialist.  I presently am the CEO and Administrator of a ((medical)) facility in Sidney, Ohio.  I'm also a registered nurse.  Not that any of that matters.  The sighting is what it is.  Weird and wonderful.;29.1383434911242;-81.0096041420116
