Bright red low flying balls of light.;2015-10-03 01:30:00;2 minutes;Bright red low flying balls of light. This was the second time we seen this same object.  The first time we seen this was a few weeks ago on September 16th around 11:30pm.  Both times in the same exact place the front yard of my friends house. Both times the bright red light was flying really low in the same motion, did a little zig zag movement then disappeared.  Both times it was to close to us to be a plane or helicopter because there was no noise coming from the light.  The second time we seen the light my friend ran into the house to get his wife as he went in I started to record the light I recorded for about two min on my phone but it only recorded the last 1 second of the video which we found really strange.;29.1383434911242;-81.0096041420116
Bright light in the sky;2019-12-20 19:15:00;Approx 20 min;Bright light in the sky I seen a fixed light in the sky that slowly faded away only to come back brightly.  It appeared to hover is the same location with a slight movement left to right at times and up and down.  I witnessed it for approximately 20 minutes, but recorded about 1.5 minutes of it.  It caught my attention when it got very bright which is what made me notice it in the first place.;29.1383434911242;-81.0096041420116
