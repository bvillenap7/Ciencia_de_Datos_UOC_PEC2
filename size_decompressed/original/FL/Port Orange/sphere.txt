5 Orangish-red spheres traveling east to west in a row over Port Orange, Florida (Daytona Beach area) Dec 24, 2016;2016-12-24 20:30:00;~15 minutes;5 Orangish-red spheres traveling east to west in a row over Port Orange, Florida (Daytona Beach area) Dec 24, 2016 I saw five orangish-red twinkling round objects in the evening sky around 20:30 - 21:00 traveling in a straight line from horizon to horizon, equal distance apart from east to west on Christmas Eve 2016.  Each object appeared to be at least 1000 feet in altitude and were traveling at a constant speed, except for the middle one which seemed to slow slightly before disappearing.  Each light twinkled and had the same illuminosity until the light faded somewhere over or near the Spruce Creek Fly-In Airport.  The light source acted like a looping (repeating) laser projection, although the cloud deck was broken or scarce that evening.  The only other conclusion I could reach was that the objects were highly illegal drones which had situational awareness of one another.  They traveled in a straight line along a consistant heading from somewhere near Ponce Inlet, Florida (New Smyrna Beach Airport) and the Fly-In.;29.1383434911242;-81.0096041420116
It was New year's Eve , my family and I we're outside, I was about to leave when I looked up and seen an orange orb.;2017-12-31 23:00:00;7 minutes;It was New Year's Eve, my family and I we're outside, I was about to leave when I looked up and seen an orange orb.  I first thought it was a plane, but then realized it was moving very slowly and changing direction.  It would get brighter then dimmer.  It would get so dim that you couldn't see it then all of a sudden show up again.  I have video of this event.;29.1383434911242;-81.0096041420116
