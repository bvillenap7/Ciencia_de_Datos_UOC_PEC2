OBSERVED TRANSLUCENT TRIANGULAR OBJECT MOVING NORTH TO SOUTH DIRECTLY OVERHEAD, APPROXIMATELY TWO HAND WIDTHS WIDE.;1998-11-17 21:30:00;15 SEC;OBSERVED TRANSLUCENT TRIANGULAR OBJECT MOVING NORTH TO SOUTH DIRECTLY OVERHEAD, APPROXIMATELY TWO HAND WIDTHS WIDE. I was outside in the back yard of my house looking for possible meteors, at the time looking directly overhead.  A translucent object, apparently triangular in shape and about two hand widths wide, no lights whatsoever, moved through my field of view from north to south.  It was moving so rapidly that it quickly was disappearing over the house, so I ran around to the front yard and could still see it continuing directly south out of sight. I doubt that I would have even seen the object if I had not been looking directly at it when it went by. The whole event lasted only about 15 to 20 seconds.  There was no sound whatsoever connected with its passing, but stars could be seen through the object as if looking through a semi-transparent piece of glass with no clean edges. I observed no other lights or objects (and very few meteors). I am prompted to write this report (so late after the event) by the many similar sightings observed of translucent triangular shaped objects since then, most recently in Wisconsin on July 6th.;29.1383434911242;-81.0096041420116
Orange/white glowing lights in night sky, triangle formation, moving from west to east July 18, 2012 - 9 PM;2012-07-18 21:20:00;5 minutes;Orange/white glowing lights in night sky, triangle formation, moving from west to east July 18, 2012 - 9 PM During my evening bicycle ride heading south, I saw a bright orange glowing sphere emerge from above the tree tops.  As I watched it, two more followed forming a triangle shape.  Then, two more came after that.  They were all the same size, shape and color.  They did not flash like the lights of a plane would.  They did not make any noise and traveled at a steady pace from East to West over the river and out towards beachside and the ocean. A small airplane (4 seater maybe) followed after them in almost the same direction, which confirmed for me that they were not small airplanes flying together. At that moment, someone a few blocks to the west lit off some fireworks.  Not sure why other than maybe they had some leftover from 4th of July, but it made me wonder if they had sent up some Chinese lanterns.  But, the lights I saw stayed in the exact same formation, did not gain altitude that I could tell, did not flicker or change in any way, and none scattered or floated in different directions.  I thought theyâ€™d have to be pretty talented or lucky to send up lanterns in a triangle shape and have them stay that way as they floated over the river. Regardless, after these lights had gone out of sight, I proceeded a little further with my bike ride but was a shaken by what I had seen.  I have never seen anything like this.  So, I decided to turn around and head home going north on the same road.  When I did, as I approached the same area, two more of the same lights emerged flying parallel to each other and also went from West to East over the river and out towards beach side and the ocean. I have three photos from my cell phone camera of the first set of f five as I was heading south and one picture of the two I saw when I was heading north.  The first two pictures have a street light in the photo and the distance from the street light changes, so you can tell that the lights have moved away from the street light.  In the first three, the color of the lights appears white, although they were orange to my naked eye.  The last picture of the final two I saw more accurately reflects the orange color.;29.1383434911242;-81.0096041420116
