Two glowing orange orbs moving east to west.;2012-01-08 19:00:00;5 min.;Two glowing orange orbs moving east to west. I went outside at around 7pm to have a cigarette in the backyard.  I was looking up, and out of the corner of my eye i saw two orange glowing orbs moving east to west.  At first, they were both moving about the same speed, then one slowed down, and the other kept going.  I called my wife out to see, and by the time she came out, the faster one was almost out of view.  She got the binoculars, but couldn't make out any distinguishing features.  We watched for a few minutes, as the fast one moved behind a tree, and the slower one seemed to just hover and then slowly move away.;28.4132183183184;-80.774118918919
