large cylinder shaped craft in cloud vanishes.;2001-06-25 21:00:00;one minute;large cylinder shaped craft in cloud vanishes. Observed cylindrical shaped cloud streaming out of a lit up cylinder shaped craft that had a wide white headlight beam coming out of the front. The craft was at about 3000 foot elevation, traveling East over Cocoa, Florida at about 80 miles per hour. The beam was pointing down toward the ground at about a 70 degree angle. The light did not go beyond the cloud surrounding the craft, it just illuminated the front lower area of the cloud. The cloud streamed straight back from the head of the craft for over 2000 feet, making it impossible to tell how long the object actually was. In about 6 secomds the light and cloud faded out and completely vanished. Stars became instantly visable through the location from which the craft vanished. Shortly after this sighting a large jet powered craft circled the area at a slow rate of speed, as if it was looking for the UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the cluster of reports that appear her for the evening of Monday, June 25, 2001, were caused by the launch of an ICBM by the U. S. Navy from the Kennedy Space Center.  We are grateful to the FAA Military Liason office in Jacksonville, FL the USAF 45th RANDS unit and the Naval Operations and Testing Unit (NOTU) for their assistance in our attempt to determine the cause of these reports.  A similar test was conducted by the USS West Virginia submarine off the east coast of Florida on March 07, 1998, which caused similar reports.  PD));28.4132183183184;-80.774118918919
Large object over lake;2009-08-08 23:00:00;20 minutes;Large object over lake It was approximately 200 feet tall with a width of about 100 feet.  It was semi oval shaped with a flat bottom.  It had what looked like swirling fire in tight circles all over it entirely.  It was floating over a lake that is about 3 miles wide, on the opposite side of the lake from my position.  It floated up and down about one hundred feet high, down to water level, many times.  I watched it for twenty minutes, and decided I should leave because it was coming closer.  This area is next door to the Kennedy Space Center, and Patrick Air Force Base.;28.4132183183184;-80.774118918919
