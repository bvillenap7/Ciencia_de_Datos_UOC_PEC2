It moved for a few seconds then just went out.;28.4132183183184;-80.774118918919

This time the ball of light was in the south east sky, again moving in an arc shape and dissapearing suddenly.  At first I thought it was a reflection of a green light from the traffic lights, but I was stopped and at a red light. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));28.4132183183184;-80.774118918919
I saw a large bolide like object that brightly flased and then dissapeared;2013-03-26 21:00:00;30 seconds;i saw a large bolide like object that brightly flased and then dissapeared I saw what I believe was a bolide or something similar.  I was looking at the stars when a large, bright object lit up the sky.  It was so bright, it lit up our pool deck as well.   My wife was with me and although she did not see the object, she saw the pool deck lite up when the object &quotexploded&quot. It was traveling very fast from east to west in what appeared to be relatively straight across the sky: it did not seem to be falling.  It looked like a large comet like object with a large, long tail.  I observed it only for a few seconds when it suddenly flashed a very bright light as if it exploded.  Then it seemingly disappeared.  I did not notice any falling debris or smaller objects coming from it after it flashed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

From Cocoa, Florida looking towards direction of Space Center, it looked like another rocket was lifting off.  Working there, I was not aware of any launches scheduled that day (today).  Wife noticed that the object appeared to be on a trajectory that will take it directly overhead.  It did fly overhead but emitted no sound.  Trajectory of object was from north-east to south west.   Wife left pool to get phone and head to front yard to take a picture of object.  Within a minute, a second object appeared on the same trajectory.  I then when to front yard and informed wife that a second object was about to appear over the house.   I went inside and grabbed a digital camera and managed to take one picture when it was lower on the south west horizon.;28.4132183183184;-80.774118918919
