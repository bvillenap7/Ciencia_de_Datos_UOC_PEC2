Gold,amber lights hover along the horizon, then vanish;2000-05-19 21:00:00;1 1/2 hours;((NUFORC Note:  We have not seen the video, but we feel several elements of the description are suggestive of twinkling stars.  The duration of the sightings is suggestive of celestial bodies, although if they moved as suddenly as the witness reports, they would not be attributable to stars or planets.)) Gold,amber lights hover along the horizon, then vanish On numerous occasions from about 9pm EST to 11pm EST, from February to May, my room-mate and I have witnessed several golden colored lights hovering along the horizon from the southwest to the northwest.  They appear brighter than stars or aircraft and remain stationary for 15-20 minutes before vanishing, sometimes appearing in another location.When viewed with a 200x zoom lense they appear to pulsate from orange,amber to red in a random pattern. Last night I videotaped three of them west of Cocoa, toward Orlando. During the sightings, there is often a sudden burst of activity of aircraft swarming the area near the lights, in pairs,leaving within 1/2 hour after the sighting is over and regular air traffic patterns resume.;28.4132183183184;-80.774118918919
Moving Light Flash in the Northern Sky;2011-07-12 03:00:00;5 minutes;Moving Light Flash in the Northern Sky I had a sighting at approximately 3am on 12 July 2011.  I was up late studying some materials for work.  After I completed my studies I went outside my home for a few minutes to get some fresh air before going to bed.  I occasionally take a few minutes to clear my thoughts by looking at the starry night sky. I am very familiar with various aircraft and spacecraft types.  I live and work on the Space Coast where I have witnessed and participated in many launches of various vehicles.  What I saw on this night could not be explained by any type of vehicle or object I have ever seen.  It was a virtually cloudless night as I looked north and up at about a 45 degree angle, I was searching for the Big Dipper.  The Big Dipper has become a very familiar star pattern to me.  As I searched I saw a bright flash that I assumed to a reflection off a terrestrial satellite.   About 30 seconds passed and I saw the flash again.  This time I focused my gaze in the area of the flash.  I could see a dimly lit object moving north-north-east.  I knew that it was not an airplane due to the lack of navigation beacons.  I also realized that due to the position of the earth that it was too dark for any earthbound satellite to be reflecting the sun.  I saw another VERY bright flash about 60 seconds later again further! north and to the east of where I saw the first flash. I honestly do not know what it was that I witnessed but what I do know is that it was not anything conventionally known. It made no sound and it looked as if it was on the edge of space.

Red glowing lights in the Cocoa Sky;2012-01-01 19:00:00;30 seconds;Red glowing lights in the Cocoa Sky These occurrences happened on two different nights of this past January of 2012 early part of the month.   The first was at 10:00 at night, my husband and I saw two red lights up above a low flying airplane coming over the top of our house.  We had just laid down for the night and I looked out and saw this plane coming towards the house and flying lower than normal.   That's when we got up a looked and saw two red lights up above the plane and behind it a bit.  As if something was following the plane.  It was not a military plane but a plane indeed, perhaps a Cessna.  The two red lights then darted off to their left and behind a cloud.  One came out the other side and continued east. The next night at 7:00 I looked outside and two more were in the sky and they seemed to join together then dart off in opposite directions at a very fast speed.  One just seemed to stop and disappear.   I've seen a few strange things like this in my life and it makes me feel like there must be others that are embarrassed as I am to report this kind of thing. I see there was another report on your site made in the ealier part of Jan. similar to our sighting and in the Cocoa as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));28.4132183183184;-80.774118918919

I started to think I was crazy because every single one would move in any direction the either disappear into another light in the general area or it would break apart into either one or even up to 5 different color balls of light. Then each ball of light would dance around each other at random distances and come back together I to one light. Every few minutes at a random area in the sky these balls of light would flash a light towards another ball of light. Itâ€™s amazing the whole sky is covered with moving star like objects that move around random directions starting at one ball of light and break up int a number of different options this has been going on for hours. My opinion they are intelligent! ly operated.;28.4132183183184;-80.774118918919
