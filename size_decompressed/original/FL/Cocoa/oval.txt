Here 1 min. gone the next;2005-10-28 18:15:00;5-10 secs.;Here 1 min. gone the next I was on the road delivering food for our rest., it was around six (dusk), the sky was a bright pink color here in florida  when something in the sky caught my peripheal vision.  I looked out the front window and noticed something in the sky reflecting light off its craft.  The UFO looked like a horizontal fat ellipse.  It was prety big for how high up it was, Looked like it was at jetliner cruising altitude.  I felt that it knew it had been seen, i looked down at the road for a second then back up and it was gone.  no trace and nothing left in the sky. I scanned and scanned the sky trying to see if maybe it just moved, but it was gone.  I drove for 5 minutes while still studying the sky, but with no avail. of seeing it anywhere.  I gave the people their food and took one last look west into the sky and there was no ufo, but there was a jetliner moving south to north heading into the same area the UFO was at minutes earlier.  I watched and as the plane passed, i clearly noted that the commercial 7?7 was 2-3 times smaller than the UFO at about the same altitude and the jetliner left a condensation trail, UFO didn't.   I have eagle vision, I've grown up on many air force bases to know what jet and choppers look like, also seen many launches from kennedy space center to know what a rocket looks like.  This was none except a UFO!!!   I finally got to see a UFO!!!  Thanks for letting me tell someone.;28.4132183183184;-80.774118918919
9 bright/white, colorful, oval objects in 3 different formations all travelling NE over Cocoa,Fl.1/10/2009;2009-01-10 16:30:00;15 minutes;9 bright/white, colorful, oval objects in 3 different formations all travelling NE over Cocoa,Fl.1/10/2009 About 16:30, 10 January 2009, I was working in my yard and heard a helicopter.I looked up and saw a Chinook helicopter and much higher I observed 4 bright/white objects in a rectangle pattern moving North East. At that time my neighbor and his wife were walking by and I called their attention to them and ran in the house to get my binoculars. I looked at them through the binoculars and saw that they were of many beautiful colors that seemed to expand and contract or flow into each other. The colors were red,orange,green,raspberry and several shades of blue.  I handed the binoculars to my neighbors to look and then I noticed 3 more in a line from East to West travelling in the same North East direction. Looking through the binoculars they were also of these same beautiful colors. My wife came out of the house and we handed her the binoculars and she remarked that they appeared to be translucent like a jellyfish. The last ones observed were 2, one behind the other travelling in the same North East direction. The lead one seemed to slow and the trailing one seemed to touch or bump into the lead one. The lead one then turned the most beautiful blue that I cannot fully describe, almost like a Carribbean blue but more vibrant. They did not seem be moving fast or make any turns and appeared to be as high as our commercial aircraft fly, but these objects left no contrails. The sky was clear/blue. We were all very excited seeing thse objects because the beautiful colors gave us an uplifting feeling. Later that evening I saw another neighbor in the supermarket and he told me he saw the same objects. Before this incident I was somewhat doubtful of stories about UFO's, but this experience has changed my views.;28.4132183183184;-80.774118918919
9 oval shaped, bright multicolored objects moving toward Kennedy Space Center. Viewed from Cocoa, FL;2009-01-10 16:30:00;15 minutes;9 oval shaped, bright multicolored objects moving toward Kennedy Space Center. Viewed from Cocoa, FL I was working in the yard and looked up and initially saw 4 oval shaped bright objects in a rectangle pattern moving North East toward Kennedy Space Center. Two neighbors walked by and I called their attention to the objects and also my wife.  Some of the objects appeared to be of bright multiple colors and one was a bright raspberry color. I ran into the house and got my binoculars and then we saw 3 more that appeared to be in a straight line.  Looking at them through the binoculars some were bright white while others were multicolored and seemed to change colors as they moved.  The last two we observed were bright white and seemed to move more slowly and came very close to each other and stop momentarily as it appeared they touched. At that point one turned the most beautiful blue color and they drifted apart and continued the same route as the others.  I am retired military.;28.4132183183184;-80.774118918919
