My wife was sitting on our patio speaking to my daughter on the phone. She called me to say there was a really strange light moving behind a tree line on the St.John's River.When I came out I saw a bright object moving south above the river.I knew it was not an airplane because there was no sound.When the object cleared the tree line we nearly freaked out. It was a bright, round object with rings around it.I grabbed my binoculars and was amazed at what I saw. The object inside the rings seemed perfectly round and had a silver grey color. There were bright flashes of light on the surface.It looked like Saturn. It moved very slowly down the river and at times seemed to hover over the water.After awhile it drifted behind the clouds and we never saw it again.This was definitely not of this world.I have always felt that there must be other intelligent life now I am convinced of it.;28.4132183183184;-80.774118918919

Just happened to look up at about a 45 degree angle and I saw a super sphere punch through the clouds.  It was travelling East at an incredibly fast speed.  I was able to watch it for about 1 second until it was literally out of sight.  I have never seen anything travel that fast.   I was able to snap 2 photos of the disturbance it made in the clouds.;28.4132183183184;-80.774118918919
