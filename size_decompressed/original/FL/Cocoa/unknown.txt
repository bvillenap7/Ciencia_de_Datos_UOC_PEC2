Four green lights seen close to the ground while driving;2010-04-19 21:20:00;30 secs;Four green lights seen close to the ground while driving At approximately 21:20 I saw for green lights very low to the ground, just above the tree line while driving in my car.  These were not helicopters as they had no light sticking out the back that I could see.  Two of the lights were stationary and the other two appeared to be doing circles around each other.  When I exited the highway I could still see them, however when I turned around to go back they were gone.;28.4132183183184;-80.774118918919
Silent Storm UFO Pictured.;2012-12-06 22:10:00;10 minutes;Silent Storm UFO Pictured My wife and I were out on our front porch noticing how clear and starry the sky was. The odd thing that my wife noticed first was that there was a strange lightning storm to the east approximately 10 to 15 miles away. It looked like a cloudy Jellyfish.  The lighting continued for several minutes. (50+ minutesâ€¦)  I grabbed my camera and drove to the edge of the Indian River for a better look. I took several pictures on 12megapixel Kodak camera set for low light.  I was trying to capture the Lightning. It was not until I returned home to review the pictures that I realized what I captured.  I thought initially that is was star or a pixel artifact.  I rapidly changed my mind when I noticed that it  (The pixilation spot) continued across three separate pictures.  Upon zooming I could see clearly that it was a craft. This is for real. I am not a hoaxer.;28.4132183183184;-80.774118918919
Two lights cris crossing each other at a fast speed;2016-04-10 20:00:00;5-7 minutess;Two lights criss-crossing each other at a fast speed In the evening of April 2016, while walking home from church, I noticed 2 lights moving in the sky. I first thought they were just 2 planes flying in tandem, until they started crossing back and forth across each other.  They were criss-crossing too fast to be planes.   I watched them until they were out of my line of sight.;28.4132183183184;-80.774118918919
