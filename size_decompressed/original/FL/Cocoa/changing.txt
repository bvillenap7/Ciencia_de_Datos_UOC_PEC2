Star looking object spliting in two sighted over Cocoa, FL on SR 520  East;2009-02-05 22:30:00;30 min.;Star looking object spliting in two sighted over Cocoa, FL on SR 520  East I was driving alone at night. It was late (approx. 11:30 PM) on a dark two lane road (SR 520 East) with no street lights and almost no other cars on the road. It was a cold and extremely clear sky, with no clouds and lots of stars. At first, I noticed a small looking star object in the sky that split in two and then the two objects were ejected in oposite directions (similar looking to a fireworks display). Then a few minutes later, I noticed a small blue colored spec (star) in the sky that suddenly got larger and brighter and continued to do so until I began to wonder if this larger (now white looking object) was going to actually land. But just as soon as that thought entered my mind, it shrank into it's original small blue spec size and color. I thought it was strange but ignored it until it happened again, then I began to really wonder what was going on up there! The show in the sky ended when I entered I-95, where there were more cars and street lights, etc. And when I arrived home, I rushed in my house, grateful I had made it home safe. P.S. sorry, no photos!;28.4132183183184;-80.774118918919
