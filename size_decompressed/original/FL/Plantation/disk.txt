I saw the craft in the sky from a distance. It caught my attention from the way it was flying. I could tell almost immediately that it wasn’t a plane or helicopter or any other kind of aircraft that you would “normally” see flying in the sky. It was black and disc shaped. It flew across the sky at a normal pace that a helicopter would for example. Then suddenly it just stopped and hovered in place for a moment. Probably 20 to 30 seconds. Then just shut up into the sky at an incredible speed. It parted the clouds on its way up. As I watched it I didn’t blink once, it definitely irked me. Before it shot up, it almost seemed that the craft rotated and then ascended up. But it was so fast I can’t be sure.;26.1355;-80.2347
