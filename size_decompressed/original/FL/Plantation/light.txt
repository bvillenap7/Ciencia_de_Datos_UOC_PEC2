It looked like an extremely bright shooting star, but it was traveling up at about a 10 degree angle to the horizon and much slower than a meteorite. after about 30 seconds of travel, the tail disappeared. The red round light traveled for about 4 minutes at a very slow speed. I got my camera phone ready to take a pic and the tail started to form again. This time the object took off at an extremely fast speed up and toward the east. I waited for a while to see if there were any more signs of the object but saw nothing else.;26.1355;-80.2347
Bright red/orange light hovering high in the South Florida western sky then suddenly disappeared;2012-07-10 23:30:00;1 minute;Bright red/orange light hovering high in the South Florida western sky then suddenly disappeared At approximately 11:30pm EDT my wife and I saw a bright red/orange light in the South Florida western sky for about 1 minute before it just disappeared.  The entire time it hovered perfectly still and had an infrequent pulse to accompany the glow.  At one point it appeared to have a light corona circling the very bright core.  It appeared to be far too high to be a helicopter.   I also ruled out a commercial airliner because of the lack of navigation lights as well as movement.  It was far too bright, orange, and far off that it could not be a search light or flare.  My wife thought that she might see something on Google Sky Map, but the light just abruptly disappeared before the app could even be opened.   Very strange indeed.;26.1355;-80.2347
Bright light goes dim and bright in equal sequince traveling frome South to North ata very hight altitude;2013-08-14 05:25:00;<4 minutes;Bright light goes dim and bright in equal sequince traveling frome South to North ata very hight altitude At 5:25 this moring I noticed a light brighter than the stars moving from the South to North.   When first sighted the light was bright than after a few secound dimmed to very light and after after say 30 secounds the light was very bright.  This happened four (4) times then when it dimed again and disappeared.  The white light was very high and moving say 12 plus inches before disappearing.  Standing outside by my garage I first spotted the light say directly over my head to about 20' down. At first I thought I was seeing a satilite but the object was moning from the South to North and the light changed from bright to very dime and then went so dime you could not see it any more and I never saw it get bright again.;26.1355;-80.2347

I walk south and look behind me and see an orb of light shoot. Walking my dog, noticed a constant whooshing sound similar to that of cars on a highway, only I don't live next to as much of an active street as this sound is making it seem.  Not to mention it sounds alot like it is coming from the air above the distant northern area. If it is just a road, I never noticed the noise.  This peaked my interest and curiosity, and I started walking my dog south in the direction of the neighborhood's dumpster to throw away a trash bag, away from the noise with my back to it, occasionally looking backwards into the sky.  A little over halfway to the dumpster I look behind me once more, and I see an orb of white or gray light shooting across the sky about 3 or 5 times faster than a nearby plane would. It was at no point stationary, and I saw it moving from right to left at about a 35 or 40 degree angle downwards, and I lost sight of it when it went behind the horizon formed by nearby trees and houses.  If you were looking straight dow! n the horizon and moved your eyes about 10 degrees upward, that is where the object was in terms of height/distance.  No sound from the object, and I am unsure if the whooshing is related. I can still hear it now however, about an hour or less later.  Everything appears noisier than usual tonight, and there seems to an increase in air traffic, however I do often see many aircraft due to living somewhat not far from an airport.  From my terrace I have a large view of the sky because of the empty space caused by the lake.;26.1355;-80.2347

The lights moved to the east at a decent pace no noise was heard at all.  The lights were in a trapizoid shaped position moving through the sky as planes flew on by we saw them go past the lights as well with no visible affection to the lights.;26.1355;-80.2347
