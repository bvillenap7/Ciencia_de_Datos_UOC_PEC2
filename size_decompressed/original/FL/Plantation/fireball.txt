Bright Orange / Red Light with no strobe lights;2005-12-24 21:00:00;1min 30seconds;Bright Orange / Red Light with no strobe lights It was a clear night, and my fiance and I were sitting in the back yard.  He looked to the west and noticed a bright orange/red light tracking north east, in the same flight pattern as the planes.  We live near Ft. Lauderdale Airport.  We called inside to the rest of the family and they all came outside.  We watched it slowly move, northeast for about a minute and a half.  It then dropped what appeared to be a fire ball to the earth, then completely disappeared.   There is no way that it could have been a meteor or a satelite as it was traveling very slow, about the same speed as a plane.  It was also very low to the ground, about 15,000 feet and 7 or 8 miles out. It looked like it split in half. I called Ft. Lauderdale Airport and asked if a plane had crashed. The head of avaiation said that he would call the control tower and get back to me. He called back and said that they saw nothing on there radar systems.;26.1355;-80.2347
6 ORANGE LIGHT WERE  MAKING A FORMATION IN MY BACK YARD AND THEN MOVED W TOWARDS THE EVERGLADES.;2009-01-02 21:15:00;10 MINUTES;6 ORANGE LIGHT WERE  MAKING A FORMATION IN MY BACK YARD AND THEN MOVED WEST TOWARDS THE EVERGLADES. MY HUSBAND AND I WERE WATCHING T.V. AND MY HUSBAND LOOKED OUT THE SLIDING GLASS DOOR AND SAID OH MY GOSH WHAT IS THAT!  I FOLLOWED HIM OUT BACK AND THERE WERE TWO ORANGE CIRCLES WHICH MADE NO NOISE, BUT CLOSE ENOUGH TO SEE PERFECTLY.   AT FIRST THEY WENT SLOW AND MOVED WEST, AND MET UP WITH FOUR OTHER LIGHTS AND WERE MAKING A FORMATION IN THE SKY.  WE COULDN'T BELIEVE OUR EYES.  OUR KIDS WERE SCARED, AND MY DOG WAS GOING CRAZY.  THIS IS THE SECOND SIGHTING IN A FEW MONTHS.  I HAVE PICTURES OF THE LAST SIGHTING OVER THE SUMMER.   I LIVE ON WEST BROWARD BLVD AND FLAMINGO ROAD. I NOTICED SOMEONE ELSE NOTICED IT AS WELL.  THEY WERE ORANGE AND MOVED SLOWLY THEN FAST.  THEY WERE DOING A FORMATION IN THE SKY.  SOMETHING A PLANE AND HELICOPTER COULD NOT DO. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. I CALLED MY MOM AND RAN TO MY NEIGHBORS.   IT IS A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT TONIGHT.  THERE WERE NO CLOUDS IN THE SKY.   THE OBJECTS WERE NOT VERY HIGH OR TOO LOW, BUT ENOUGH TO SCARE US.

UFO sighting in Plantation, FL.;2020-02-14 00:04:00;~90 seconds;UFO sighting in Plantation, FL. First saw (with naked eyes) object in the northern sky.  Object then with great speed exited the atmosphere to the western sky.  But I also have a dash cam that picked it up at least a minute before I noticed it, so from the video it was first noticed in the eastern sky and in under a minute it was past me really low like within 10k feet then it exits to the western sky.;26.1355;-80.2347
