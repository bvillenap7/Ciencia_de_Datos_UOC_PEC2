They looked as if they were just floating and seemed to be at a much lower level than airplanes, which I see regularly as I live near the airport.  They suddenly disappeared and could not see we're they went.;26.1355;-80.2347
UFO sighted over the Everglades in Broward County.;2017-04-25 23:45:00;3 seconds;UFO sighted over the Everglades in Broward County. My wife and I saw from the NW sky over the Everglades a weird object flying fast on an seemed elliptical curve going from west to north.  Looked like a cross with 4 red light points.  The object left behind a tail of fire as it accelerated.  Also, its lights dimmed and the object vanished from the sky.  Looked like it took off between the 3 seconds, or so, we spot it in the sky.   Either the object was large, or it was not that far away, high in the sky as we were able to observe it clearly.;26.1355;-80.2347
