One very bright and large object with thin tail and bright dots attached on both sides of tail.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??  PD));2011-10-09 23:00:00;20 min;One very bright and large object with thin tail and bright dots attached on both sides of tail. My son and I were walking the dog late at night.  When walking toward our house, diagnally from our house we both saw a large very bright light too bright and big we thought to be a star.  We continued to look up at it and it appeared to lower itself some.  We started to walk more quickly towards our house with the dog arm in arm as we sensed it was a UFO.  Then my son took pictures with his cell phone and we didnt feel afraid.  It looked like a very, very bright large star, but with what appeared to be a thin long tail that was bright with some small bright dots  clung to the tail.  I said to me it resembled a firefly.  It was north-east to our house, which we are west in the county.  My son thought it had changed formation ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??  PD));26.1355;-80.2347
