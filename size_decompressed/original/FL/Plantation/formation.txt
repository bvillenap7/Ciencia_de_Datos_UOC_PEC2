7 lights in the sky just West of Broward Blvd & Flamingo Rd;2008-08-04 22:50:00;12 minutes;7 lights in the sky just West of Broward Blvd & Flamingo Rd At 10:50PM on 8.04.08, we were all walking the dogs before bed.  Directly West of Broward Blvd & Flamingo Road were a total of 7 lights in the sky.  4 lights were in a linear formation ahead of 3 lights in a triangular formation...then the 3 caught up w/ the 4.  One neighbor came out of his house.  He stated that he saw them when they were East of our neighborhood and there was no sound.  We only saw them when they were well West, out over the everglades. We watched the lights for about 12 minutes until they were out of sight.  They were not flashing in any manner...just constant light eminating from each object.  It was very freaky. This is also in the flight pattern of jets landing at FLL.  There is NO WAY at all that these lights were any type of plane.  Nothing blinking, absolutely NOT following what the planes do (they land to the East, these were going straight West). I only have very poor video from my phone as I was not in front of my house when we saw the lights.;26.1355;-80.2347
