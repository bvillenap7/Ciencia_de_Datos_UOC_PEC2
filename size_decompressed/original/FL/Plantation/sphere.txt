Four orbs flying over Plantation, FL flying N-NW from FLL airport area.;2012-02-29 21:00:00;2-3 minutes;Four orbs flying over Plantation, FL flying N-NW from FLL airport area. I stepped outside to make a phone call. Look straight out to the horizon,  S-SE, looking towards FLL [Fort Lauderdale Airport about 10 miles away (I google mapped it)] From that direction I saw four Orbs.  The orbs appeared to begin from the ground, perhaps since they were coming from a distance. At first I thought they were rockets or perhaps fireworks, because they were flying almost straight up. The altitude was, I believe about that of a helicopter hovering.  The orbs where headed our direction, I would say N-NW from the airport area (I guess).  They began to fly over head, gaining altitude. At first they were flying in an unorganized manner.  But as they came closer, and gained altitude, they made a U formation.  We took a video of this.  By the time we took the video, they were in the U formation and high over head.  They slowly began ascending until they were out of sight.  The orbs themselves had a reddish orange glow and were whiter toward the middle of the orb.  There was four individual orbs, they moved independently but still in a formation.  There seemed to be one that was almost, mockingly, zigzagging a couple of times.  To note, there was a commercial airline that was either landing or taking off when I first saw the orbs.  (This was seen from the community houses on Peters RD and University DR);26.1355;-80.2347

4 orange orbs traveling east along broward boulevard in Plantation Florida.;2014-04-14 20:24:00;4 minutes;4 orange orbs traveling east along broward boulevard in Plantation Florida i was driving in plantation florida on april 14, 2014  around 8:25 p.m. heading west to hiatus road. I was for some reason one of the only cars on this stretch of street on broward boulevard.  i was talking to my fiancé because i had just left a dinner meeting, and I noticed a lot of what seemed to be airplanes coming along the flight path going east to fort lauderdale airport.  as I continued on I began to realize that the 7 objects were not all airplanes, the airplanes had flashing strobe lights red, green and white but I noticed 4 objects that were  red/orange and what I will describe as orb shaped they were traveling along a formation for lack of a better word, two were on my right and they seemed to stop and stay still and to my left the other two which were a little further west started to catch up to the two standing still, I was sure at this point that these were not airplanes, the other two then crossed over broward boulevard and met the other two orbs! and formed a connect the dots square pattern and continued north east right over my car... I was really excited at this point and told my fiance to hang up and run outside our house and look in my general direction of where I was driving, I noticed the orbs were still going but the airplanes were so far behind, it was an amazing and frightening sight.I rushed home grabbed my fiance and we drove back to where I saw them but as I knew...they were no where to be found… ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite sincere, and sober-minded.  We suspect that she is a very good witness.  PD));26.1355;-80.2347
