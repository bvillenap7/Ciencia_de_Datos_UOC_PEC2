very large V shape object no lights and no noise at all traveling west to east .;2008-04-07 23:05:00;20 TO 30 SECONDS;very large V shape object no lights and no noise at all traveling west to east . At about 11:00 pm or a little after my wife and I were sitting in the back yard of our home talking and checking out the stars. It was pretty clear out and just a few wispy clouds. My wife stepped inside for a moment and I called her out to take a look at something kinda of strange. I first thought it was a flock of pelicans flying in v formation but then as it came more into view it was to wide to be birds. It looked like a wide boomerang like the stealth plane ,but it made no noise at all and had no lights what so ever. We followed it from the back yard around the side of my house and then out front where it finally passed behind some clouds and we lost sight of it. At first it looked really low almost at helicopter hight and if it was at that  level it would have been the size of 2 buses but when it passed behind the clouds I knew that it was much higher because not to much later a small Cessna flew below the clouds and was much higher than I had first perceived. If this was at a high altitude it would have been huge.   I would love to know if someone else in my area saw this.;26.1355;-80.2347
