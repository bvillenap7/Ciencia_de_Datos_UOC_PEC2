A friend and I were driving around looking for an address. We realized we were on the wrong street and turned around in a parking lot of a apt. complex. The driveway we were pulling out of was directly across the street from a place called Ralphs funeral home. We were looking west. As we started to pull out we looked directly in front of us and above the funeral home was an oval shaped craft. it was hovering about 5 feet, over the funeral home.I seem to remember it making a very soft humming noise. It had very small colored lights under it. It was moving extremely slowly. I remember thinking if I got out of the car I could walk under it at the same speed it was moving. It was about one and a half times the size of the building aproximately 70 or 80 feet in length.I was absolutely not a hot air ballon or blimp. I asked her if she saw it. She said yes. We sat for about a minute and then she got panacky and speed away. We went back I got my mom and I made her take me back. There of course was not trace of the craft. But within the same month my father spotted something in the sky outside of our front door while entering the house. He actually called everyone out to see. It was a small light like a star in the distance I cannot say exactly how high but it was at about a 40 degree angle from the ground. It was moving very slowly up. not straight up but again at about a 40 to 45 degree angle. It then shot out a tail of light like a rocket would, it did this about 3 times, and disappeared. we were looking at it facing west. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));26.1355;-80.2347
