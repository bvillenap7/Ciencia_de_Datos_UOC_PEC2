Can someone tell me what this is?;2002-09-28 20:30:00;30 seconds;Can someone tell me what this is? I was out walking my two year old before bed.  We stopped at a neighbor's vacant house that they're remodeling to see the progress.  I paused in front and looked back to see the whole house, and from right to left (SW to SE I think) a relatively large object traveled at a downward angle looking like it could be going to the Boca Chica Naval Air Base. It was out over the sea.  But I've never seen anything like this.  It traveled too fast for a plane, too slow for a meteor (shooting star), and seemed bright and fuzzy around the edges, a bit orange colored.  I have no idea what it is but wanted to ask someone if they could enlighten me.  I thought perhaps a sattelite but I've never seen one that looked like it was going to land.  Thank you.;24.5615;-81.7818

The object looked like a fireball coming down from the sky. The longer I looked at it I noticed it was brighter than others I had seen. Suddenly half way to the ground it stopped in mid air and reversed direction. It traveled for about ten to 20 seconds then disappeared.;24.5615;-81.7818
