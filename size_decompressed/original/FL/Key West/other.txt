I saw four (4) evenly spaced lights, in a horizontal arrangement, traveling at a high rate of speed. Lights were arranged, from my point of view, from left to right, white - red - white - red. They traveled following the ships channel, from south to north. It took about fifteen (15) seconds for them to travel from the southern horizon to the northern horizion. Without an acurate reference as to their size, I would have to guess their altitude to be anywhere from 500 to 2,000 feet.;24.5615;-81.7818
