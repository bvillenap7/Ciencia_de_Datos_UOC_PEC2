Orange object over Key West, Florida;2004-11-28 05:45:00;5 minutes;Orange object over Key West, Florida Key West, FL. High altitude orange object observed nearly straight up from viewer and slightly east, first thought to be a satelitte moving from south to north, but object slowed, stopped and then made slow steady movements east then south then north and repeated motion with some variations. Visible stars (that didn't move) confirmed the motion and actions of the light. Could have been a very high altitude DEA or customs craft, but there was no sound. Sighting occurred one hour before sunrise in totally clear skies, three hours after a thunderstorm. Object faded away after five minutes of the movement. Location was above Key West NAS, but was very high. No pulsating light..solid. Photo taken, not yet developed. Not expected much, due to light levels and high altitude, even with lens extension.;24.5615;-81.7818

Lasted about 4 minutes.   Only had iPhones so could not take photos...very high up in the night sky but definitely were not stars.;24.5615;-81.7818
