Craft was flying erratically at a high rate of speed approx. 1500 - 3000 MPH.  Ten minutes after the craft was out of our sight, we heard a large roar but there was nothing visible in the sky.   Could this have been a US Military jet?;24.5615;-81.7818
Large black cigar shape,no lights or sound.;2013-08-14 04:00:00;5 minutes;Large black cigar shape,no lights or sound As I was sitting on the balcony,looking out into the ocean, I noticed a large (3 football fields in length) cigar shape object moving across the sky blacking out the clouds as it moved.  It had no sound,no lights and approx. 1500 ft plus up into the sky.  I have no clue as to what this was,but it was big, defined in shape,dark black and I could clearly see the object blanking out the the clouds as it move through the sky.  The amount of distance in such a short time, it had to be moving at a very fast pace.;24.5615;-81.7818
