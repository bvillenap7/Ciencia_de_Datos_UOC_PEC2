Object changed direction after crossing paths with Space Shuttle and ISS;2008-02-18 19:30:00;5-6 minutes;Object changed direction after crossing paths with Space Shuttle and ISS Observing the overflight of the Space Shuttle and Space Station, they were about 4 to 5 seconds apart, They were moving from the north west sky in a southerly direction. I then saw a third object moving from South of the Space Shuttle and ISS in a northerly direction, it crossed paths very close to the Space Shuttle and ISS. After passing the Space Shuttle and ISS it made a very large arcing turn to an East heading. This object was not as bright as the Space Shuttle and ISS and looked very much like any other man made satellite except that it changed directions Basically it moved from a North heading and changed directions to an East heading after passing the S.S. and ISS. This was also witnessed by a friend 5 miles away.;24.5615;-81.7818
Shining orb flew in a zigzag pattern then disappeared;2020-10-06 23:38:00;28 seconds;Shining orb flew in a zigzag pattern then disappeared The UFO we saw was very high in the air, we thought it was a bright star at first. This was a very windy day as Tropical Storm Gamma was passing through, so we are certain this was not a bird or bug - and it was so high in the atmosphere that no creature could survive nor move that fast. The UFO moved lightrning quick in a zigzag from one point to another staying in place for a moment or so at each point of stop, ultimately returning to approximately the original location where we first spotted the it in the dark sky. Then the UFO accelerated up and disappeared out of site, all faster than a blink. We did see a few planes overhead in the sky, I have never seen anything in the sky move like this.;24.5615;-81.7818
