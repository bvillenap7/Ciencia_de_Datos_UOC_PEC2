ON OR ABOUT THE DATE LISTED ABOVE I,ALONG WITH MY FAMILY, WERE DRIVING HOME FROM THE BEACH WHEN MY WIFE ,WHO WAS LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW;1989-08-30 20:05:00;12 minutes;ON OR ABOUT THE DATE LISTED ABOVE I,ALONG WITH MY FAMILY, WERE DRIVING HOME FROM THE BEACH WHEN MY WIFE ,WHO WAS LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW, ASKED ME WHAT KIND OF AIRCRAFT IS THAT? I TURNED TO LOOK AND AT ABOUT 100YDS OFF SHORE ,COMING SLOWLY FROM THE EAST TOWARDS US I SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE TWO BRIGHT LIGHTS (BRIGHTER THAN AN ARC WELDERS TOURCH ) I PULLED OVER AIMING THE FRONT OF THE CAR DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE INBOUND OBJECT THUS GIVING US A MUCH BETTER VIEW. THE OBJECT CONTINUED FLYING TOWARDS US AND STOPPED ABOUT 15 FEET DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF US, HOVERING OVER THE WATER AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 10 FEET. I COULD NOW SEE IT MUCH CLEARER. THE OBJECT WAS IN THE SHAPE OF A TEARDROP SLIGHTLY FLATTENED. SILVER IN COLOR WITH NO IDENTIFIEABLE MARKINGS. IT MEASURED APPROXIMATELY 7 FEET LONG, 18 INCHES HIGH AND ABOUT 3 FEET WIDE ALL MEASUREMENTS COMING TO A TAPERED TIP WHICH I BELIEVED TO BE THE TAIL OF THIS CRAFT. IT HOVERED FOR A FEW SECONDS THEN IT, QUITE EFFORTLESSLY, WHILE REMAINING IN ITS' PRESENT POSITION, IT TURNED RIGHT FACING NORTH THEN IT TURNED LEFT FACING SOUTH. AFTER A FEW MORE SECONDS IT LOWERED ITSELF TO ABOUT 6 TO 12 INCHES OVER THE WATER AND REMAINED THERE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. I FIND IT QUITE INTERESTING THAT WHILE IT HOVERED AND EXECUTED THESE FEW MANEUVERS  I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE THAT IT: 1.HAD NO PITCH AND YAW, 2. HAD NO VISIBLE  HEAT SIGNATURE, 3. IT HAD NO RIVETS OR WELD SEAMS TO SHOW HOW IT HAD BEEN PUT TOGETHER,AND 4. THERE WAS NO DISPERSAL OF THE WATER AS THIS CRAFT HOVERED DIRECTLY OVER IT, AND 5. THAT THE TWO BRIGHT LIGHTS THAT I SAW I BELIEVED THEM TO BE ITS' PROPULSION SYSTEM BUT INSTEAD OF PUSHING THE CRAFT IT APPEARED TO BE PULLING THE CRAFT. AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES OF JUST HOVERING ABOVE THE WATER THE CRAFT RAISED ITSELF TO ABOUT 3 FEET ABOVE THE WATER AND PROCEEDED SOUTH OUT TO SEA. AS IT WAS OUTBOUND IT STOPPED AND SLOWLY STARTED TO RISE AS IT WAS RISING I NOTICED THE SUNSET CRUISE BOAT WAS OUTBOUND IN THE CHANNEL. IT WAS AS IF THIS OBJECT KNEW THAT TO CONTINUE ON ITS' PRESENT! COURSE THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY THE SHIP. THE SHIP PASSED UNDERNEATH THE OBJECT WHICH WAS NOW AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 200 FEET AND CONTINUED OUTBOUND UNTIL I LOST IT IN THE DISTANCE. ABOUT TWO WEEKS LATER A STORY APPEARED IN THE KEY WEST CITIZEN OF A MASS SIGHTING OF A UFO THAT HOVERED OUTSIDE OF THE SEATTLE SPACE NEEDLE. AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING I WAS ASSIGNED TO THE HYDRAFOIL USS PEGASUS (PHM-1) STATIONED AT KEY WEST FLORIDA. AND AS AN OPERATION SPECIALIST (RADAR OPERATOR) I WAS TRAINED, BY THE US NAVY, IN LOOKOUT AND REPORTING PROCEDURES WITH EMPHASIS ON ATTENTION TO DETAIL. DATES LISTED ABOVE ARE APPROXIMATE. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness, and he seems credible and serious-minded to us.  Date is approximate.  PD));24.5615;-81.7818
