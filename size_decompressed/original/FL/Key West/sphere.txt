Spere formation over Key West;2001-07-01 22:00:00;30 seconds;Spere formation over Key West I wanted to report a sighting which has me puzzled. About two weeks ago I was in Key west and staying at a hotel. I was in the pool, which is obviously outside, the time was approximately 10 PM. As I was relaxing (I had not been drinking!)and staring into the night sky I suddenly noticed a V formation of orange spheres. They were moving fairly slowly from my point of view but I realized that at the altitude that they were traveling their speed must have been much greater. The odd thing about this was one ball that was zigzagging in and out of formation. As much as I am interested in UFO's I am a logical person and do not jump to conclusions, but I have no explanation for what I saw! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));24.5615;-81.7818
