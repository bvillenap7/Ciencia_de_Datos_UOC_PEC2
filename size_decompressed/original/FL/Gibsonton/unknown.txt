They flew in sync together into a large cloud.  They seemed like white orbs when they flew into dark cloud. I got video of them disappearing into cloud.  When zooming into cloud later i noticed the cloud actually has rectangular and square shapes throughout, square like edges and white orbs inside.;27.8441;-82.3677
