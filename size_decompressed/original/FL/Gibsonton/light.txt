A 2 person witness to a UFO entering a type of worm hole;1996-06-01 02:00:00;30 seconds;A 2 person witness to a UFO entering a type of worm hole This incident occurred approx. 2:00am. mid 1996. It was a very clear beautiful night. I was fishing on a boat with a friend of mine, ((name deleted)). It was getting late and we decided to call it a night , as we approached the boat dock we noticed a glowing amber colored light/object hovering over an overpass next to the dock. We were approx 150’ from the overpass and the object was approx 40’ above the overpass. This light/object bobbed up and down and side to side as if it was floating on an invisible ocean. We looked at each other and said what the hell is that? I immediately stopped the boat and we watched it for a few seconds it then instantly shoot upwards   It appeared to have gone to the edge of the atmosphere. It moved so fast that it left trails from the point it was at to the point above us where it stopped. At this time it appeared as a very bright amber colored star. As we continued to watch it for a few seconds we noticed a red ring of light start to appear/pulsate around it. The red ring first started out dim and as it pulsated it got brighter. At the point of it’s brightest moment the amber object disappeared into the ring. As soon as it went into the ring the ring shrunk and dissipated. The amber light looked slightly fuzzy as if it was dissipating heat from it, like the ripple affect you see from a hot road or hot car hood on a hot summer day. It did look like an object radiating light rather than just a light in the sky. It appeared to have substance to it. We did not hear any noise coming from the object.
