Black Triangle with white dots on each of the triangles angles viewed in riverview;2008-04-05 23:45:00;2 minutes;Black Triangle with white dots on each of the triangles angles viewed in riverview On Saturday April 5th 2008 I was in a parking lot of a grocery store waiting for a friend of mine to get off work. He told me to pick him up at 11:00PM but didn't get off until close to 12:00AM. I was stuck waiting outside for him for over a hour. It was pretty humid so I didn't want to wait inside the car so I got out and waited. The parking lot was almost all empty except the cars of the people that were cleaning up the store. At about 11:45PM I laid out on the roof of my car and looked up at the night sky. I looked at a couple of planes passing by and then something caught my attention. There was this object moving really slow directly above me. I'm a skeptic so I tell myself it's probably some balloons, until the object stopped moving. Then I got a really good look at it. Here is what I can describe as only a black Triangle and it was pointing north, and where the angles were, there where white dots in their place. The object was almost directly over me. I got a good look at it but because of the lights in the parking lot I had to cover up the light coming off the street lights so the glare wouldn't get to my eyes. So I just stared at it for about a minute, then it started to move north very slowly. Nobody was around so I could show them so I didn't bother taking my eyes off of it. It continued north until I couldn't see it anymore. I googled Black triangle with white dots in the sky and this website came up, and I saw that there was a string of sightings of the same thing in February of 2007 that described the exact same thing. So I was happy I'm not the only one who seen it. I hope this info was helpful.;27.8441;-82.3677
