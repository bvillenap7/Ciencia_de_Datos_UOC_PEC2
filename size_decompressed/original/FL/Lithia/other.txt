Suddenly, we both saw a dark-matt egg shaped object  flying at low altitude, going south, faster than any airplane or drone that size at that altitude, slower than any shooting star and completely silent. Its size was small, perhaps it was as big as a car flying 2000 feet over our  heads. My wife exclaimed A spider!, then she realized the object had dark extensions around the main body and moved them as it progressed into the night sky.  I focused only on the main body and did not see the extensions.  According to her they were darker. We followed it in amazement for about 20 seconds as it merged with the horizon.  The  main body was dark-peanut brown, perhaps emitting a very dimmed matt glow.;27.8257;-82.1374
