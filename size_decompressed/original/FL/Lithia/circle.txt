I twinkles white , red, blue, green.  It's too close to be a star (its not Capella star). It appears when looked at through binoculars to have a matrix of spherical lights around it.  It's been appearing between 2am to about 4 am each night for a couple of weeks,except on some clear nights its not there.I think a star would be always there every night.there's been a lot of helicopters out here late at night these days and what may well by military jets as commercial jets don't operate so late at night. Eh,? who knows maybe its swamp gas or a weather balloon (LOL) . ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));27.8257;-82.1374

There were no rhythmic lights like a plane, just white light.   After about 10 minutes, they moved off then completely disappeared. there was a great deal of heat type lightening happening around that time.

Bright circle-shaped object appearing over Lithia, Florida.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible star??  PD));2016-10-14 18:00:00;2 hours;Bright circle-shaped object appearing over Lithia, Florida. I have seen this circular object in the south sky on and off for the past week.  Last night I decided to take pictures of it and video tape it.   It starts out looking like a very bright light shaped like a circle at dusk.  As darkness comes the bright circle slowly moves down during a duration of about 2 hours. I watched it last night.   Two family members were also present and witnessed this as well. Then it simply disappears.  It moves so slow you can't actually see it move at all but every time I would glance up it would be in a different spot.   I first noticed the circle on 10/09/16.;27.8257;-82.1374
