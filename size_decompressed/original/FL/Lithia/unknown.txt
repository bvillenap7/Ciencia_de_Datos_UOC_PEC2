Glowing orange object see in the eastern sky from Lithia FL.;2012-01-19 00:00:00;10;Glowing orange object see in the eastern sky from Lithia FL. Driving home we saw an orange light, like a brighter than normal star, in the eastern sky.  The object moved from left to right with a barely visible, short, trailing tail/exhaust.  At first, we thought it was a meteor/etc. until is stopped in mid air.  Then we thought it might have been a helicopter with a strange orange light of some kind.   While stationary, it continued to glow orange for several minutes and then simply winked out like one would turn off a light bulb. The details of the object were impossible to make out because of the apparent great distance of the object.;27.8257;-82.1374
