((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch at 2055 hrs (EDT).  PD))   There were three orange lights that came and then disappeared.;2005-04-29 21:10:00;30 seconds;There were three orange lights that came and then disappeared. My dad called me over to where he was standing. When I got there I looked up in the sky and saw three orange lights, two of which were moving towards each other in a slow, steady movement. The other one seemed to be covering a star. They disappeared for about four seconds and then came back for another two seconds and then disappeared again. After that they only appeared once more, but we could barely see them anymore. All that was left was a star that was underneath one of the orange lights. We then saw an aircraft fly right over where the lights had once been. ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the witness describes above the launch of a Titan IV missile out of Cape Canaveral, which occurred at 20:55 hrs. (Eastern) on this date.  The missile apparently was launched to the northeast, so it was visible along the eastern shoreline of the U. S..  PD));27.8257;-82.1374
