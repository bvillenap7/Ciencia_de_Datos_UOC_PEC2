Fireball AMAZING  crashed in Florida.;2009-11-30 23:30:00;30 seconds or less;Fireball AMAZING  crashed in florida I'm a manager for the arbys out in fish hawk, when were were outside having the last smoke brake of the night, a massive fireball cam hurtling out of the eastern sky going west , i think the object might have crashed some where near that area, it was maybe the size of a one engined plane. it had to be at least 300 feet away form the ground, but traveling FAST. it was something i never seen before the object was in sight for roughly 30 seconds getting lower and lower to the ground traveling at maybe 400 miles per hours is what my guess would be, made the lights flicker in the store and parking lot of the surrounding area, loud thump about 10 seconds after it was out of sight lots of bird activity after sighting.  left a smoke trail. also i remember seeing a strange cloud shaped like a halo around the moon.  might not have anything to do with the object i saw but maybe it could be relevant information;27.8257;-82.1374
