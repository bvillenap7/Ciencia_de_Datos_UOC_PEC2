((anonymous report));2018-11-01 07:00:00;3 minutes;Basically, my husband was helping me put the baby in the car, as i was about to close the car door i noticed a blue light, it kinda looked like on of the blue lights on top of a cell tower but there isnt one there.   So, we stare and under neither the blue slowly flashing light that mind you was not going in a sequence was what looked like shimmering thing of mist and different blue light all in the sky and it 7am.  We just stared in disbelieve, it looked as if it was transitioning from night to cloaking itself.  I turned my head and it disappeared.
