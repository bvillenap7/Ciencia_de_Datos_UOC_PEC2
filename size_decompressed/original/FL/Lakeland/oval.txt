Oval-shaped object in South Lakeland, FL.;2014-09-24 21:24:00;3 minutes;Oval Shapped Object in South Lakeland, FL. At the approximate above date, and time my wife and I were heading home in 2 different directions.  I noticed just above the tree line heading west bound on Sheppard RD.  A very low flying object.  At first I thought it was an airplane landing at the near by airport.  The only problem with this object is I could not see wings it was oval shaped with 4 lights on top, and a non pulsating red light on the bottom.  I only noticed the object for about 1 minute before it appeared to disappear in front of my eyes.  My wife called me to ask if I saw the light.  I was very surprised because my wife is very skeptical, and she described the same object, but she saw it for about 3 minutes, she described it disappearing as well before I told her what I saw.  I am just curious if anyone else noticed this object.;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728
Two VERY bright glowing objects moving from north to south over Polk County on New Year's eve, 2019;2019-12-31 22:45:00;3 minutes;Two VERY bright glowing objects moving from north to south over Polk County on New Year's eve, 2019 I was born and raised in the Orlando area for over 22 years, have lived in Lakeland for 31 years and have seen probably 75+ launches of rockets (including satellites, Apollo missions, space shuttle launches, Space X launches) in my 57 years of life.  I have been a pilot for 32 years and worked in the airline industry for 17 years.  Last night (New Year’s eve-12/31/19), my wife and I saw something I have never seen before.  We were pulling into our subdivision at 22:45 and to the east of Lakeland (probably over Winter Haven) we both witnessed a VERY bright, orange glowing oval shaped object.  It was not ascending or descending.  It was moving at the same altitude from a northern to southern direction.  It resembled what a night rocket launch looks like from a distance-without a smoke trail, but in a horizontal, not vertical attitude.  I stopped my car, got out and started filming it on my phone.  Suddenly, another one appeared behind the first one.  As the second object disappeared behind a tree, I got back into the car and sped to my house one minute away.  I ran to my backyard and out onto my dock on our lake where I could have had an unobstructed view of the two objects to the east.  When I got out there…90 seconds or so after seeing the last object, they were both no longer visible.  I stayed out there for 3-4 more minutes scanning the sky in 360 degrees and could not locate the again.;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728
