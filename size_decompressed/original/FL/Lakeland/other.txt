I was intranced by what I saw and in my mind it could have only been a jet plane.  It was down so close to the trees that I could make out what I thought was bolts or rivets in the outer metal of the plane.  Not until later did it occur to me that planes were all grounded and that as I stood watching it I heard no sound at all!  Then I realized that I could not say for certain that what I saw was actually a plane.  It was very large but I saw no windows of any kind and no wings.  Just a lot of metal and bolts or rivets and it was moving slower than I would have thought a jet could move and it did not disturb the trees or have any kind of tail that I could see.  It has taken me this long to report it because I didn't want to appear crazy or labeled a crank or something.;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728
Neon blue light in the sky disappears and then phone call is interrupted by unknown sound .;2010-01-11 01:30:00;1 minute;Neon blue light in the sky disappears and then phone call is interrupted by unknown sound . I was driving to the gas station after leaving one of my friends house around 1:30 am and while I was driving I saw something out of the corner of my eye.  I look and I see a neon blue object  with what it looks like some sort of  haze around it about a hundred yards in the sky.  At first glance I think it is a helicopter about to crash into the ground but I hear no rotors, so I keep watching it . I was going about 40 mph and the object was going about 100 or so. As it is flying in the air it is going at an angle towards the ground and eventually goes below the tree line and I was listening to make sure it really wasn't a helicopter that had crashed but I heard nothing and the object just disappears . Right after I see this I call my friend who's house I just left and describe to him everything I just saw . While describing this to my friend our conversation was interrupted by a noise. A noise I never heard before had all of the sudden interupted my call. The! only thing I can really say it sounds like is that sound from a sonar just with a different tone And much much louder . I can honestly say I never heard anything like it before. This experience made me a believer.;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728
