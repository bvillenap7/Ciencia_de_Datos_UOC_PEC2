The lights formed a perfect triangle, but flying severely crabbed to direction.  Est elevation, 5,000'.  est size 50-60' across. speed apx 150kmh.  No sound.  Very clear night. Triangular area between lights vibrated like rippling water.  Very noticeable.  Object flew south apx 45 seconds, then turned southeast.  All 3 lights remained visible at all times till all out of sight. The 3 oval lights were not AC lights and the angle the object(s) were flying towards was crabbed.  When the object(s) were directly overhead, the very pronounced vibrations or rippling effect taking place between the lights (in the triangular shape) was very pronounced.  Also, the object(s) flew south and through the Lakeland Airport traffic pattern -restricted fly space.;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728
Went over house during hurricane;2004-09-06 00:35:00;2-3 min;Went over house during hurricane Hurricane Frances had been setting on us all day and I was staying up SUN. night watching reports.We were in the east eye wall and catching it bad. At 12:35 I started hearing what sounded like a large engine running (like a utlity truck or something) on the road in front of my house over the howling wind.I thought what is a crew doing out in this .I had heard earlier on TV all county vehicles had been orderd off the roads.Then the sound got louder like it went in to a great strain and more of a roar. About this time I realized it was getting closer to the house comeing across the front yard. Then I thought OH CRAP Tornado,but in my mind that didn't jive.I ran to my back door which faces north and stepped out on the first step and looked up.The wind was comeing from the south and all kinds of debris was going past the side and over the house to the north. Now the sound was right over the house and had changed to what I can only describe as the roar of a rocket at lift off, deafening. Still looking up I jumped to the ground (to get a better angle) just in time to see a yellowish light pass over the tree line of my back yard. The trees are about 30 feet high and I could see the tops silhoueted by it just a few feet above them. What ever it was it was going west to east cross-wind to the storm. I couldn't see a shape but I could tell something soild was there. No way was this a plane or helicopter.In a couple of seconds it was out of sight and hearing range due to the storm.I'm 50 years old and have worked electrial mechanical all my life. I'm sorry for taking so long to report this but we'er still doing clean up from the three storms that crossed us.;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728
This object did not move for long periods, it just hovered.;2013-01-15 23:00:00;2 nights;This object did not move for long periods, it just hovered On the evening of the 15th I went out to walk the dog around 10 PM.  While I was out I noticed a light in the sky south of my home.  I didn’t think much of it but I noticed it was bright white with red, yellow, green and blue lights flashing randomly.   As I watched I noticed that it was not moving.  It appeared to be at a substantial height, at least 2000 ft.  I brushed it off as an unusual sighting.  I observed it for 15 minutes and it did not move.  The next when I took my dog out at 9PM and the same light was south east of my home.  I observed it for about 15 minutes again and it was stationary.  All else was the same.   At 11 PM I took the dog out again and it was gone.  When I got out to the driveway I saw it again.  It had moved to the spot that I saw it the first night and remained there until I went back in.   Whereever it is spotted it remains stationary.  Too high for a copter and too stationary for a balloon or plane.   It is cloudy today so I won’t! see it but if it comes back  I will take movies.;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728

Orange lights across the night sky - a strange and unexplained sighting.;2014-03-09 21:30:00;15 minutes;Orange lights across the night sky - a strange and unexplained sighting. At approximately 9:30 p.m. this evening, a number of us in our RV Park witnessed a large number of orange lights go slowly across the night sky.  Looking towards the south, the objects went from right to left and were staggered in formation.  The objects were much larger than a bright star, made no noise and seemed to be fairly far away.  At first a large number of them were grouped together, following that a few were together and then one or two in a grouping. We contacted Bay News 9 to see if any strange reports were called in - none so far.  We also sent them pictures.  After looking our issue up on Google, there were photos posted similar to ours and we are anxious for an explanation on what we all witnessed.;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728
All of a sudden what I thought was an airplane in the distance was right in front of me with Blue & Red lights.;2015-01-07 06:30:00;8 seconds;Returning home from Polk City, I was driving along Hwy 92 toward Lakeland.  I looked up into the sky and observed what appeared to be Venus, then an airplane.   All of a sudden what I thought was an airplane in the distance was right in front of me with Blue & Red lights.  Hovered only 2 seconds then darted to my left and disappeared.   Could not see shape, only lights.   Get this I DO NOT believe in UFO's, but my logical rational mind could not resolve this.;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728

It changed from orange, then to green, disappeared;2019-06-21 04:15:00;1 minute;I was talking with two friends of mine.  We had just returned from a night out at a club in Tampa.   We were standing outside talking, when I saw a VERY bright orange light to the north moving upwards vertically in the sky.  It changed from orange, then to green, disappeared again, and then turned orange.   In about 1 second, it turned green and moved horizontally at light speed, then bright orange, and then green before going off into the distance.;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728
