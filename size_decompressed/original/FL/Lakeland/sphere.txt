Gold object seen in the sky near Lakeland, FL, very early on November 6th.;2004-11-06 00:40:00;10 seconds;Gold object seen in the sky near Lakeland, FL, very early on November 6th. My husband and I were driving on I-4 east, coming from Tampa, on our way home to Orlando.  I had received a call on my cell phone, and was driving about 5 minutes past the last exit for Lakeland when my husband grabbed my arm and pointed at something in the sky.  The object was round with a short trail.  It was gold in color and bright, both the trail and the round object.  It seemed very far away.  We thought it was a comet or shooting star at first, but then the trail instantly turned off...is the best way to describe it...the round object kept moving for a few seconds, then also instantly disappeared.  I'm interested if anyone else saw this.;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728
Orange Chinese lantern type orb in sky;2012-05-07 00:30:00;10 minutes;orange Chinese lantern type orb in sky I was sitting outside my apartment having a smoke when I heard dogs barking. I looked up, it was a bright orange (looked like a Chinese lantern in the sky with a fiery yellow red color in the middle kind of flickering about) something just about 5000 ft  up slowly in a straight line just glided over the apartments then disappeared in the clouds and never came out.  It took about 5 or 10 minutes...really awesome...I would love to know what it was...  Was not a weather balloon or a weeding lantern or anything like that,just wish I wasn't the only one to see it...nobody believes me but I know what it saw.;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728

Saw an orange orb hovering over the Lakeland power plant for about five minutes.;2018-04-17 21:00:00;5 minutes;Saw an orange orb hovering over the Lakeland power plant for about five minutes. At about 21:00 on 04/17/18, my fiance and I were walking our dogs near Lake Parker in Lakeland when I noticed what looked like an orange orb stationary in the sky.  The craft seemed to be hovering above the CD McIntosh, Jr., Power Plant from my perspective.  I stood and watched it for a few minutes and pointed it out to my fiance to confirm I wasn’t seeing things.   She confirmed that she could see it to and that it was not moving.  After watching it for a couple minutes, the glowing orange orb emitted a bright white light (resembling a spotlight from a distance) for approximately ten to fifteen seconds, before changing back to an orange amber glow.   My fiance and I brought our dogs into our house and I went to the window to keep watching it.   By the time I got to the window, the object was travelling west at what looked like the speed of a commercial airplane.  No blinking lights on wings or anything that would identify the object as an airplane or helicopter could be seen on the object.;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728
