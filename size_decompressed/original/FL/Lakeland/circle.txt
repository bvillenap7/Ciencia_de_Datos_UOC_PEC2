Unknown circular object in the sky near a fireworks show in lakeland.;2001-01-01 00:01:00;two minutes;Unknown circular object in the sky near a fireworks show in lakeland. On new years day, my sister, parents, and I were watching the fireworks display when I noticed five strange lights in the sky. after about thirty seconds I told my sister to look up. she too saw it and comented that it could be some sort of UFO. The craft was circular in design with five round lights that seemed to fade from orange to red. the lights did not seem to rotate around the craft, instead they seemed to just stay perfectly still, as if suspended in mid-air.It is my belief that this craft was for some reason attracted to the fireworks display. After about two minutes the object moved away, at first traveling quite slow,but suddenly began to travel at a speed that I could not track it by sight.;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728

In the southeast direction I notice a bright white light that isn't moving.  I mention it to my brother.  He thinks it's an airplane.  I know it wasn't because the object was still in the sky.  The sun was still out so it was too bright to be a star.  When I asked him to take a picture of it, the object slowly disappears.;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728
