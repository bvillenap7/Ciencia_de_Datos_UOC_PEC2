I noticed in the eastern direction what, at first glance, seemed to be a jet or rocket. However, it was not moving as fast, it was remaining completely parallel to the horizon. Plus it did not have the trail of smoke that lasted forever trailing behind it. It seemed to have a light, quickly vanishing tail. I watched it for a few minutes before I ran inside and got my husband to come look. He followed quickly behind me out the door where I pointed the still there object out to him. Approximately 1 full minute passed and the thing disappeared. The light smoke trail followed insuit. I have very strong fewelings that this was no jet nor rocket. I have seen jets and I am 100% positive, this was not a jet or plane. Ok, so. This is literally burned into my brain, why a perfect parallel shot along the horizon, not really high, not really low...but far away from me. Basically if Im on the ! N. Socrum in Lakeland, the thing was probably directly over Lake Mirror. I don't know, but seeing another sighting on your site made me think even harder. Description seems pretty close to what I saw, same time, day, direction??!!;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728
