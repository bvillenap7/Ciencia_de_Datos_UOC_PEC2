12/28/99 lakeland florida orange ball;1999-12-28 23:05:00;1 minute;12/28/99 lakeland florida orange ball I spotted a 'fireball' from where we were staying in lakeland. It was as I remember, quite a dark night,and rather quiet as well. I looked north at around 2305hrs. The object passed across the sky at a speed no man made craft could possibly attain. I powered across the sky from north east to north west and was only in sight for around one minute. I felt that if I had gone to get my cacorder, I would miss it. it was very high, a kind of orange setting sun look about it, no noise at all, the sky was clear and very cold.;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728
8-10 orange glowing silent objects floating across the sky seen in Lakeland, Fl;2012-11-22 20:15:00;4 minutes;8-10 orange glowing silent objects floating across the sky seen in Lakeland, Fl We were coming home after a Thanksgiving dinner and as we were pulling into our driveway I saw yellow orange glowing objects floating thru the sky.  I live on the north side of Lakeland, Fl near I-4 and those object were floating in the sky from direction of Orlando towards Tampa, following the path of the interstate I-4.  They were following one another in a line, some went across the whole sky, some disappeared/faded away.  They were maybe twice the size of the stars in the sky, but had an orange warm glow, unlike the bright silver yellow star lighte.  There was no noise, they moved quite fast across the sky, but apperead to be floating or gliding at the same time.   We saw 8-10 of them.  My 4 year old son called them &quotorange moving stars&quot, pretty good description actually. P.S. There is MacDill AFB in Tampa, and those were floating exactly in that direction(checked it later  with my smart phone compass).  However, those did not look like and airplane or helicopter or a blimp.;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728

3 objects on fire moving higher and higher till out of sight.;2014-06-21 21:00:00;2-3 minutes;3 objects on fire moving higher and higher till out of sight. June 22nd 2014 approximately 9 p.m. I walked outside to get in my truck and go pick up some food and I saw a light in the sky and I thought to myself that's too big to be a star. Is that an airplane? No it looks like something is on fire. Is it moving? Slowly. It looks like it is rising. As I am standing with my face southwest the object was moving southeast and rising. As I am getting my phone out to get video of this, another one appears to the right.  I took some video, and as I was putting the phone away, I saw another one appear from the right, so I started video again I did not video very long because I figured it was not picking it up very well.   When I put the video on my computer and enhanced, it looked round, yellow in the middle and red around the outside like a fireball.   I am putting the videos together on windows live movie maker and posting to youtube.  The quality is bad.  I am hoping someone or I will be able to enhance the video better and get a better look. http://youtu.be/eClbM1F6sPU;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728
