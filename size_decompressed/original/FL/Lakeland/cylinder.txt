Changing directions, but staying in a small area of the sky.  We then see a blue like streak either shooting from the craft, or possibly it had made an extreme movement as in zipping away very fast.  But it didn’t exit the sky.  After that we didn’t see it for maybe 30 seconds, it appeared once again, in the same vicinity it had been, and we again saw a flash 2 more times, but then disappeared completely.;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728
