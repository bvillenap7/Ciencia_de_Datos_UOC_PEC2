I believe we are being visited a lot more than people think.;2005-11-15 00:00:00;several hours/days;I believe we are being visited a lot more than people think. I was sitting by the fire, about midnight when I noticed that the stars in the sky were moving.  What follows next is the most amazing things that has ever happened in my life.   It went on for several nights, and they come back the same time each year.  I can't describe how bone chilling cold it was.  In the cow pasture behind the house I could see several tents with an ominous orange glow.  They were ships on the ground I later found out. I watched for several hours and could say I know for a fact there are several types of beings.  Tall ones, upwards of 8ft. Short ones, with larger heads and a mouth from ear to ear.Blue ones and orange ones.  One seemed very friendly as we interacted telepathicly.  The greys however did not like me watching them dig, or collect water or whatever they were doing out there.  I could fell them all around me. I tried to watch several different groups beem up to the mother ship above with some type os pure beautiful light that would flash in an instant, and these groups of aliens would be gone. Further investigation in the day time reveal weeds with accelerated growth, strange trails all over the field, that had no livestock in it at the time.  I even smelled some of these weeds and depressions in the ground, what seemed to me to smell earthy, like a worm almost.;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728
was heading south Giant triangle shapped craft, moving very slow with smaller crafts escorting it.;2008-04-20 00:00:00;2 hrs;was heading south Giant triangle shapped craft, moving very slow with smaller crafts escorting it. Facing the southern sky at 5:40 a.m. The cloud cover was low I looked up and saw three lights forming a giant triangle.Hovering over the pasture. I then noticed four very tiny crafts also triangle shaped that seemed to be hovering along side of the huge one. Moving ever so slowly, I then looked even deeper straight up into the sky and shockingly realized there was an enormous grayish triangle that actualy covered almost the whole sky above me. I could barely see the outskirts of the sky itself! I watched in awe for hours as it moved ever so slowly.Then it went straight up so fast and out of sight. This is the first time I have seen this craft. I have wittnesed many other alien actions in this pasture with my son since November 2004! I can't describe in words these events. They usually always occur in November. This is the first time we have ever encountered anything of this magnitude.On other occasions, I have witnessed smaller alien vehicles that were landed in the pasture, which resembled only what I can describe as a tent with a glowing lantern inside. The actual beings I have seen range from 12'tall and skinny, to short at 3'. All with their own jobs to do in their alien race. I've seen them digging in the field with what appeared to be an object resembling a shovel.Some forming an assembly line passing something down the line and loading onto this tent with the glowing light. Watching with binoculars ( which they get disturbed by ) if you watch too long! In one instance as I had been peering to intently, the tall one swiftly turned his head looking at me right back through my binoculars causing them to break inside, now looking through them everything I see is double! I have seen craft's that look like a birthday cake with colors of blue, red, yellow and green. One actualy lifting off the top of the other and seperating in opposite directions.There are many other instances we have enthusiasticlly waited hoping to see them again.This is also the first instance in which they have appeared during or close to a full moon. Another symbolism is that it always gets real cold like a bone cold when they are near. I have no doubt at all that they know we are watching them! They know we are there!Since Nov. 2004 many occurances have taken place which is totally mind boggling. My son is the person that brought this to my attention and at first I must say I was a little to aloof about the whole idea of such! My mind was completely changed after the first sighting. We think these are the aliens better known as ( The Grays. ) After all they are gray and do not seem to be aggressive. So many other odd instances too many to write on this paper! So I will stop noe. Thank you,;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728
2 redish yellow flying objects in South Lakeland, Florida spotted hovering through the air and then sped up and vanished.;2011-07-04 20:00:00;few seconds;2 redish yellow flying objects in South Lakeland, Florida spotted hovering through the air and then sped up and vanished. On July 4, 2011, at approximately 8 pm, something told me to go outside and see if there were any fireworks going off as it had been raining, and we decided to not go into town.   My 10 yr. old daughter was with me and when we walked out and looked at the sky, there were 2 unusual looking red/yellow triangular/diamond shaped objects off in the distance.   They moved through the sky heading southwest, near what looked to be a few miles away maybe.   We were looking North.  We were both surprised by this.  I told her to run in and get my fiance and the camera.  These objects seemed to be moving in unison and at an odd speed, hovering at moments.  Then they sped up and both vanished at the same moment.   The entire sighting maybe lasted 30 secs.  From when I went outside.   By the time my fianceâ€™ came back out, they had disappeared.  The air was very still and calm and there were fireworks going off randomly, but this was much different.   The photo that the gentleman ! submitted on July 3rd from Moses Lake Washington is very similar to what we saw..;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728
