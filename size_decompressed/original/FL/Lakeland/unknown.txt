Dome Shaped with Light Trail;2009-07-21 18:00:00;Not Sure;Dome Shaped with Light Trail Hello, I am sending you a picture that I had taken the other nite while shooting clouds.  I didn't even realize that this shape, light was taken.  I had 3 pictures I had taken.  When I enlarged the picture noticing the light, I noticed the shape.  I've had people look at it, and advised me to send to verify. It appears to have a dome shaped at the top, with light and a trail like it was shooting up.  I was facing West, so it wasn't the space shuttle, which people had asked :)  I appreciate you taking the time to read and look at this picture. Please if you could let me know if this picture is worth of keeping or a throw-away!  Thanks...;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728

2 bright objects disappeared then heard rumbling east sky;2019-06-25 02:37:00;<1 minute;2 bright objects disappeared then heard rumbling east sky Getting out my truck 2 lights caught my eye in the east sky, it was if they were drifting but they were very far away.  They were bright like a slow moving fire ball I guess.  One disappeared then seconds later the another One disappeared.  One other time 3 years ago I seen what I thought was fire balls, it was 5 perfect looking round shape rocks in formation with each other like traveling across the sky in together in with a sphere together, literally over my head.  Come out of no where. The 2 objects I seen tonight were far away but had the same color as the group of boulders, bright white and yellow and slightly orange and maybe a little red. And after they disappeared I heard rumbling like thunder in a distance the lasted several minutes.;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728
