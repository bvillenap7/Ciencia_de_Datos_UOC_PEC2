Small white lighted disk in FL hovering right above shopping mall;2020-02-07 08:13:00;5 minutes;Small white lighted disk in FL hovering right above shopping mall Saw it fly across the highway while I was driving on it, thought it was someoneâ€™s drone but it looked very big for a drone.  It stopped and hovered over a shopping mall and I saw the light moving across the center ring.  Colored lights (red and green) on top and a moving light ring going around the center. It followed in my direction, behind my car for about 5 minutes. I got uncomfortable feeling like it was following me (I was the only car on a very dark road) and told myself it was a police helicopter using speed radar until I looked at it again and it was definitely no helicopter. Underneath it were many small white lights in a formation. They moved like illuminated jellyfish tentacles (?).  After a few minutes I checked to see if it was still there and I WATCHED as the disk disappeared into the sky.  My car engine had been acting up minutes before I saw it and I was driving next to cow fields for some of the sighting.;28.0381227628363;-81.9696249388728
