Large low flying UFO- Tons of multi colored lights.  No noise.  Gliding very slowly.;2007-11-21 21:00:00;3-4 minutes;Large low flying UFO- Tons of multi colored lights.  No noise.  Gliding very slowly. I was walking my dog outside.  It was a very dark night and I saw this large craft with tons of small multi colored lights.  It was gliding along very slowly.  I tried to get the dog to move a little faster so we could get closer to it to see what it was.  It was low and moving very slowly. But it was hard to see it because of trees in the area.   I got to a point where I could see the lights very closely and it seemed to mimic a house that had christmas lights on it.  For about 30 seconds I was able to compare the lights to a house that it was gliding over and I noticed that the crafts lights would change yellow, blue red.    It seemed to go  behind the top of a large tree and when I got to that area I looked for it, but it was gone.  A couple minutes later I saw what I thought was a small helicopter that looked like it was trying to find it.  I believe this happened the day before Thanksgiving, but in any case, within a couple days of it.  I am not lying or joking, this was true.

Went outside at 5:20 am and to the west saw a bright white, cigar shaped light moving horizontally from south to north. Had a white haze around it (it actually hurt my eyes for a few seconds looking at it) and short, bright light trail behind it. It was pretty large in size and moved extremely fast. I ran around the side of the house to get a better look, but it disappeared behind the trees.  I checked the meteor shower calendar and ISS track, but neither report it coincided with my location.;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277
