Bright slowly moving comet-like object in Countryside Clearwater;2016-10-17 05:45:00;5-10 seconds;Bright slowly moving comet-like object in Countryside Clearwater At approximately 5:45 a.m. on October 17, 2016, I was walking my dog in the Brookfield neighborhood of Countryside and I saw a bright bluish white light/object traveling slowly (average walking speed) towards me from across the street.  The object had a round body and a tail like a comet.  It was about the size of a baseball/softball and its tail was about twice as long as its body.  It was flying at rooftop height. Then it stopped about 2 houses in front of me.  The tail disappeared and the bottom side of the body turned a beautiful dark red and then the light/object was gone.  It did not make any sound.  It was still quite dark outside so I was not able to investigate.  I intend to look for some evidence later this afternoon.;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277
