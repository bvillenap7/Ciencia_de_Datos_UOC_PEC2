((NUFORC Note:  A launch of a Titan 4 rocket from Cape Canaveral  was conducted at 00:29 hrs. on this date.  We suspect that the launch was the cause of the several reports NUFORC received from multiple points in Florida.  We post the reports to illustrate how easy it is to misidentify a relatively commonplace event.  Even we were intrigued by the reports, when they first were submitted, and it took us approximately 12 hours to identify the apparent source of the reports.  PD));27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277

5 UFO's in broad daylight sighting.;2010-02-20 13:47:00;12 minutes;5 UFO's in broad daylight sighting I was jogging on a popular trail and all the sudden I see a blinding red flash up in the sky in front of me.  Somewhat startled I stopped and looked up.  About 300 yards in front of me and a short distance above the trees was a giant white triangle shaped aircraft surrounded by 3 balls of light.  Best way I can describe them. As I first looked up, I had the strangest sensation I've ever had. I didn't think they were UFO's, I just had no idea what I was looking at.  I could almost feel my brain trying to figure it all out. Then I finally realized what it was I was looking at.  The Triangle aircraft was about 3 passenger airplanes in length and maybe 5 stories high. The Triangle aircraft had 2 large red lights in the back and one white light in the front. The 3 lights took up almost the entire bottom of the aircraft.  The red light was blinding bright and gradually dimmed out.  As it dimmed out the 2nd red light came on and again got to be blinding before dimming out.  The white light then proceeded to follow the same pattern and just repeated this sequence the entire 12 mins.  The lights also were not coming from light bulbs. It was much brighter than anything like that. To the rear of the Triangle were 2 balls of light and 1 to the front.  Oddly they  were in a triangle pattern.  I could tell they were made of metal but much too bright to make out a shape.  The Triangle itself had some sort of distortion around the top or it wasn't made of metal if that makes any sense.  I can only compare it to a cloud that appeared to be bubbling.  All the aircraft were silent.  I heard absolutely no sound and that includes the sound around me. Now for the strange part. I was on a jogging trail and I remember a man on a bicycle ride past me.  I looked over at him to ask him to stop and look at this.  I at this time looked over and it appeared as if I was about 3 or 4 feet in the air even though I wasn't.  The bicyclist also appeared to be moving very slow.  I wanted to say something to him and it seemed like he was a million miles away.  The whole thing still creeps me out. At this time I'm standing there and a second Triangle aircraft literally appears out of the thin air and flashed all 3 of its lights and then vanished.  It didn't fly away it seriously just was gone.  It too had the same lights, it was an identical aircraft.  It then again appeared and then vanished and that was the last I saw of that one. After it vanished, I looked back and the 3 balls of light that were there were now gone too. At this time the first Triangle aircraft started to rise very slowly and just kept going and going and going.  I could still see its lights rotating in sequence when it was VERY high in the atmosphere.  It was the first time I realized how high the sky actually is.  I've seen some airplanes real high in the air and this thing was twice as far.  I eventually lost sight of it. I then looked down finally and there about 100 yards in front of me were to Police Officers staring right at me.  I do not know how long they were there or if they saw what I did.  For all I know someone called the Police on the guy standing in the middle of a running trail looking up.  I decided to just quickly leave the area and jogged away.  I have went back to that spot every year since at the same time and have never saw them again. For the record I have no clue if it was Alien or Military.  I'm not far from a very famous Military Base.  What I do know is there are aircraft capable of either turning invisible or vanishing to some other place.  Out of the 5 total UFO's I saw, only 1 flew away.;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277
I think I saw the TR-3B/Aurora aircraft tonight…;2013-06-27 21:20:00;2 minutes;I think I saw the TR-3B / Aurora aircraft tonight... I was heading home from class on 6/27/2013 I took the bayside bridge in Pinellas county, Florida heading north  Once I hit the bridge around 9:15-9:25 I noticed some strange lights on the water’s surface to the right and in front of me…  As I kept driving I noticed IT was moving south, opposite of my direction very slowly… It didn’t take me long to notice what I was seeing wasn’t normal…  Some kind of aircraft that appeared to be about 30 feet long with 3 very bright lights on the bottom within 100yards of the bridge. The lights on the bottom were dome shaped that were focused in a beam, not like a flashlight ... and  I couldn’t make out much except that the aircraft’s body was completely black, nearly at eye level from the bridge,  This thing was moving way too slow for it be a regular plane coming in for landing and it didn’t have any blinking lights, made no noise what so ever… Since I saw it at eye level the body of the craft seemed to be about 10-15 feet tall… IT looked just like the TR-3B or Aurora aircraft…  As I passed it I tried to keep my eyes on it, but I had to keep looking ahead so I didn’t crash while driving… I looked back and it was gone… It appeared to be landing at The St.pete-Clearwater international airport.;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277

I was outside with my father and mother,  When i looked up i saw 5 bright blue lights shaped like a Perfect Triangle.  I also was able to hear the rumbling noise and felt the earth beneath me shake.I saw it for a good 10 seconds, ran inside to get my phone to take a picture and by the time i went outside the sound went away and so did the craft.  When I walked back to the house I noticed the TV was turned off ( but it was on when i left the house to go take a look outside i had left the TV on)  This craft was bright, perfect triangle, it had a very loud rumbling noise but it was quick to get quite, and it stay right above a telephone pole near my house at a clear sky.;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277
Triangular light formation.;2014-02-15 01:20:00;2 minutes;Triangular light formation. While walking my dog i noticed a faint triangular shaped light formation with red lights glowing at all points in a private golf course about 50 yards away.  There was a flash of light and the formation slowly propelled upward and as it did the lights went out but something was visible to the naked eye.  Took a video with my cell phone but didnt come out as well as i saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277
Reappearance of Triangle - 3's of Otherworldly Presence;2016-12-23 03:09:00;13 seconds;Reappearance of Triangle - 3's of Otherworldly Presence Triangle in shape, in trio, exact equal space if drawn with finger to sky, will draw a air triangle  Seemed to appear out of no where. Hoovered in one position for approximately 7 seconds facing to the area of MacDill AFB in Tampa, Florida zipped in straight lines for few seconds, to the left, forward, to the right, and backwards for approximately 3 seconds, one was actually overhead, before moving to their original location where first spotted. Then suddenly zipped straight up into the sky, unable to see further due to clouds moved in. They seem to appear in the primary lighting area, the point end of triangle, was brief - Flash of light. Consider a strobe light flash but not the same as a lightning flash (there's no storms in area) as if images were being taken below them.  One flash for each stop movement before taking off. All 3 looked alike, from appearance: all were triangular in shape, had lights underneath - appears to be white, non-blinking, stationary lights. 2 Witnesses were able to count the lights for a total of 9 primary lights and a possibility of 21 secondary lights?  (Movement was too quick a photo shoot by the reporter came out blurred light movement,  unable to process or post image).  It made some type of a noise as a hum sound, that which one would consider as electrical hum pitch only when these 3 moved to another position. Reporter of this post has seen this before - 1966, 1986, 1996, and now 2016 - in time frame of Fall/Winter (except 1996, was very early Spring and a different object, which appeared to be two wheels, one big wheel (outside) with one wheel (inside).)  All events occurred within or nearby MacDill AFB in the Tampa Bay Area Reporter of this post, plus the 5 Witnesses (current event) seeing this is facing E to ESE direction. (Compared with previous visitations)  Triangle shaped flying object is triangular with a sloop upper which gives the Reporter the idea of Dynamics and Aerodynamic design. It appeared that USAF Pilots took off in the area shortly after their manifestation. Too dark outside to determine if the USAF Pilots were responding to the event. The animals, such as dogs, cats -  dogs whimpered and cats scampered into hiding. The digital system when into error, electronics malfunctioned DVR and Modem rebooted. Phones were disabled more so when overhead, attempt to take photo of one of the three, failed. One of the object which was overhead, appeared to be at least a size of a football field (Best guess) - far SMALLER than the one seen earlier especially 1966 - when Reporter had actually been in contact with aliens, which currently are known as Greys. US Government has been with this reporter since 1st contact in 1966. Other witnesses saw it, much of them scoffed a couple considered someone had a drone ... but drones do not move this supersonic speed, zip without turning sideways and forward/backwards and zips straight up.  A few reported having headache after this event occurred, went home to take a Tylenol.;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277
Boomerang-shaped UFO.  ((anonymous report));2017-10-12 22:50:00;30 seconds;Boomerang Shaped UFO While walking the dog at night, looked up to the sky, saw a triangular shaped object, like a boomerang. Big, silver or grey, with 4 to 5 round white lights on each side underneath.  Lights were steady, not flickering and appeared dimmed.  Flying very low, silent, at a steady slow pace.  No haze or glow around the object or lights, very clear against the black sky.  It disappeared after about 30 seconds.

Triangle shape flying at local aircraft elevation 10:50 10/25;2020-10-25 22:50:00;Seconds;Triangle shape flying at local aircraft elevation 10:50 10/25 We saw light appear and disappear on 10/21 and 22. Looked like satellites but were disappearing. Same light, both nights. Same pattern. Counted down the fade out, only took about 4-6 seconds. Had the same witness for both. Saw light that sat like a star for at least 12 minutes then moved across the sky and disappeared within a short span of time, roughly 4-8 seconds after it started moving. 10/25 no noise, quick for an aircraft that low. Looked the same elevation as the helicopters fly over locally. I made an animation of what it looked like. White/light grey triangle, single lights on the three corners, perplexed in one direction, didn’t spin. A little cloud cover, but I did see it in the open sky, facing east, with the moon almost to the south. Roughing flying north to south. I just want to know I’m not the only person that saw this. I’ve lived on military bases, I’ve seen planes up close and personal. I do not know what this was.;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277
