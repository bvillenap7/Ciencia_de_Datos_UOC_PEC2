I noticed a bright, white light, which at first, I thought was a meteor.  the light however was far too low in the sky (about 1000 feet) and was only illuminated for a few seconds. it was travelling at about a 45 degree angle down.  this happened in the vicinity of the Clearwater/ St Petersburg intl airport and the clearwater Coast Gaurd air station.;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277
Blue light over Clearwater Causeway;2006-06-30 22:00:00;5 Seconds;Blue light over Clearwater Causeway I want to start out by saying, ‘Sorry’, since I really am not sure what month it was in 2006 when the following event occurred. I simply cannot recall when it was but I wanted to report this hoping that it may help in some way, some how, even if the significance is miniscule. I was parked with a friend off the road on the Clearwater Causeway. We were facing NE and it was later in the evening. My friend was facing me, and I was looking out over the water. The sky was a beautiful deep purple and was very clear. What happened played out very quickly. So quickly, that I did not blink. A bright blue light appeared in the sky. It just appeared, but then quickly got a slight bit larger, as if it was heading towards me. It had to be extremely far away. It was small, but at the same time it was huge compared to what a passing plane would be, or a helicopter. By the way it was not a helicopter light. I have never ever seen a light that strong or in that bright blue color in the sky before. It stopped and then went up and backwards like in the shape of a slight arch until I could no longer see it. It moved so fast that there is no other technology I can compare it to. You could tell it moved a vast distance when it left. I have tried to find what skeptics would call a logical explanation, but I cannot find one. I believe what I saw was a UFO. I have never seen anything before this occurrence, nor after, so far.

The lighted object was as big as a star appearing to be extremely high in altitude. It moved at a slow pace for about 20 seconds till it disappeared into the night. Around 4-5 minutes after my first sighting, myself and a friend were viewing the sky after i told him what i had observed, both of us were looking around the same spot in the sky when once again another lighted object started moving east at the same speed as the other object and was viewable for 1-2 min till it also disappeared into the night.;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277

Group of red/orange flashing lights that individually speed out of sight;2011-06-03 21:00:00;2-3 minutes;Group of red/orange flashing lights that individually speed out of sight As I was driving home from dinner I started going over a bridge, and looked out south-east and saw about 15-20 red floating dots close together but in no pattern and at the same time they would all blink a light shade of orange.  Though there were 3 that were in a perfect line in the back.   I was on the phone telling the person what I was seeing and noticing everyone in cars around me looking at it also.   When I stopped at a red light I noticed a few were missing then I saw one speed off out of sight.   As I drove farther watching them go off individually I lost sight for a moment and when I regained sight of them there was only 1 left.   I stared at it and watched it speed up then off to somewhere, that's when I noticed my phone had no reception until I had driven about 5 minutes away.   It was odd because I drive through that area plenty of times a day and have never lost reception there before.;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277
Brilliant flash of light, possibly very small meteorite;2012-11-04 19:30:00;2 seconds;Brilliant flash of light, possibly very small meteorite It was a brilliant flash of light that came down quickly from the north and headed south towards the ground.  It went out of sight very quickly  as some trees blocked our sight of it or else it just burned out or disappeared. We were just driving home and it cut across the sky right in front of us. We were very close to it and our best guess is that it was a very small meteorite.  There was no sound and we couldn't see where it hit. However, there was a lighter patch of sky, a slight glow, in the direction where the object appeared to originate.  That lighter patch of sky hung around until we came inside the house so I don't know for how long. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Red light traveling from west to east over Clearwater, FL.;2021-07-04 01:27:00;30 seconds;Red light traveling from west to east over Clearwater, FL. While landing a helicopter at the St. Pete Clearwater Airport (KPIE) a solid red light was observed west of the location.  The light moved rapidly east at a steady speed, a short distance north of my position at the airport. A check of surrounding air traffic utilizing ADS-B in information showed no other traffic while observing the light. As the light passed overhead it did not change color, intensity, or speed. No sounds was observed due to the volume of the turbine helicopter, which was still running. The light continued traveling eastbound until it was out of sight due to cloud cover and buildings. A check of flights in the area after did not show any flights in the area.  The light was red in color when views approaching, aside, and while traveling away. It did not blink of strobe and did not have any visible accompanying lights. It appeared brighter than aircraft navigation, taxi, landing, or anti-collision lights.;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277
