4 red lights over the Gulf;2002-06-15 02:00:00;30 minutes;4 red lights over the Gulf My friend and I were at the beach one night, playing guitar and smoking cigarettes as I usually do during the summer break in school, when we started talkig about UFO's and ghosts and such.  I remeber he was telling me that a town right next to us, Dunedin, FL, had one of the highest recorded UFO sightings in Florida.  I shrugged this off, and started strumming the guitar, looking out into the ocean.  I was facing North West when I noticed 1 light far off into the distance, in the ocean.  At first glance I thought it was a star or satellite, or even a plane.  The sphere was barely a speck, red in color.  This made me consider the fact of a plane even more, until I saw it turn.  The turn was not a curved or graceful turn whatsoever, it was like the object shifted.  It was at one spot one moment, and all of a sudden, it dropped a good distance, then shifted to the left immediately.  I pointed this out to my friend, and we were both amazed.  We watched this light and 3 others that joined it for a good half hour, sliding up, down, at sharp angles, almost as if they were following a line, instead of a curve.  During that time, we saw one aircraft fly past, and the four red lights seemed to group together until it flew past their general area.  It almost seemed like the four lights were playing with each other, chasing and being chased.  Then, they started heading in a north, northeast direction, and kept going in that direction until they faded out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Almost expected to see a plane crash as the light was so bright, however there was no sound.  I saw it threw the window. Ran to the door and there was nothing in the yard, nothing in the sky.  The light appeared approximately 60-70 feet off of ground.  Moved from southwest to northeast over neighborhood.  Clear night, full moon in the East.   A friend saw a similar light moving from the north to the south over the local beach several nights ago at nearly the same time of night.  Blue/green close to the ground â€“ moved quickly and disappeared.  We are one who typicall believe in UFO, however there must be something going on.   Left with an strange feeling, not knowing what this is -- twice in one week.  This is the first time we have visited your site, needed to know if anyone else has seen this light.;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277

Best described as a Nerf Ball, move effortless and slow enought to watch it.   A group behind us at another table witness too. Almost right after a plane came from the south and turned immediatly east same direction as orb and then a few seconds later a second plane from noth followed behind that plane.;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277
