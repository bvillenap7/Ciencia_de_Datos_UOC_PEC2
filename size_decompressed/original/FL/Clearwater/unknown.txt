Strange lights, fast movements, clear sky;2005-07-03 21:00:00;1 hour;Strange lights, fast movements, clear sky I was watching the southern sky for fireworks from my fourth floor apartment in Clearwater and spotted what at first thought was an airplane in the distance.  It looked as though it had an unusual amount of lights to be a plane though.  As I kept a watch on it, it would move off in one direction for a while and then into another direction.  At times it was eradic.  I spotted the lights on three occassions during an hours time.  I can't tell if they were the same group or different groups.  I couldn't tell the shape because of the poor power of my binoculars (7x35).  I can't imagine any aircraft that I know of that could do the manovers this craft was doing. At the end of my viewing evening I could see a simular group of lights that were stationary in the southern sky.;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277
Red/Yellow/Orange Orb-like Lights Over Clearwater;2011-07-20 23:00:00;5-10 seconds;Red/Yellow/Orange Orb-like Lights Over Clearwater My wife woke me up after taking the dog outside to report to me that she had observed 3-4 orange/red/yellowish balls of light in a northwest direction of our home, hovering while making no sound.  As I work in Law Enforcement, and she is very familiar with my type of work as well as military, she concluded that it was not a helicopter, plance, etc.  She stated the lights were probably about 1 mile away, just above the tree lines and quickly dropped down below the treeline, then back up, and quickly left in a westerly direction toward the Gulf of Mexico.  As I was tired, I dismissed her statements.  The following day, I did some searching on Youtube.com and found a video of someone on a motorcyle in Clearwater that had videoed a similiar event around New Years Eve (1/1/11).  I showed her the video and she stated it looked almost exactly what she had observed.;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277
Bright cloud bank that dissappeared quickly;2012-11-27 22:15:00;10 minutes;bright cloud bank that dissappeared quickly The dog was barking in the back yard.  I went out to stop her from barking when I noticed a cloud bank in the western sky that was bright.  I went to the front yard to see what was making it bright.  I observed a cloud bank very thick and motion less.  Jt was like a cloud bank we get when a thunderstorm develops only there was no lightening.  I went back into the house and checked several weather radar sights of this area.  None of them showed any cloud banks, they were all clear - nothing!!!   Finding this quite odd due to thickness Iwent back out to look at this bank of clouds.  Again, to my astonishment this bank of clouds completely dissapaited except for a few small straglers.;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277
