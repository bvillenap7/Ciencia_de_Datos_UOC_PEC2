Flying object;2002-08-18 23:51:00;5 minutes;Flying object My sister, mother and I were driving to my sister's house last night, along a dark rresidential street.  My mother saw something that caught her eye and stopped the car.  Directly in front of us was a strange formation of lights.  I can't say how high it was, as I'm a horrible judge of measurement, but I assumed it was  a helicopter.  The thing was, however, that the lights didn't look like any lights I've seen on a helicopter at night.  They were a bluish white and made out the shape of an oval, as it was dark, I could not make out the shape, I would assume it was some sort of disk, however, the lights only gave me a 2 dimensional feel of the object.  I rolled down the window of the car to try to hear the rotors of a helicopterm by it's distance, it should have been audible, however, I didn't hear a thing.  At this point my little sister started panicking a little bit, and the shape started to move very slowly.  My mother decided to follow where it was going, as it seeme! d to be following the road we were on.  This chase occurred for a few minutes, and then as it was passing some trees, the object gained speed and suddenly disappeared from our line of sight.  Now the part that bothers me about the whole thing isn't the sighting itself, as is the fact that my sister nor my mother remember seeing anything.  All I get from them whenever I ask them is a weird look. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is illogical.  Correct date, based on the report description, should be August 18, 2002, we presume.

4 phosphorus discs flying in a continuing circular pattern while flying together to the center at every two or three rotations;2007-07-10 21:45:00;4 minutes;4 phosphorus discs flying in a continuing circular pattern while flying together to the center at every two or three rotations Went to sit outside and dics were there. 4 round probably best described as phosphorus plates flying in a large circle and with every possibly two or three rotations would go to the center then back out again and resume a very distinct precise path.Very very fast. Thought of calling a news station but couldn't think of the number. Called my neighbor who came out and also saw them.  She said they lasted about a minute from when she arrived in her back yard. I saw them about 3 to 4 minutes. Saw nothing in the news or on TV about them. Tho age 75 I am an active sound minded woman retired from Hospice Nursing.;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277
Saucer seen on Causeway;2012-07-16 07:30:00;2 minutes;Saucer seen on Causeway My daughter called me to state she was driving on causeway going towards Tampa when she saw a saucer in the sky.   Speed limit is 55 and everyone slowed down to 25mph to view this.   Suddenly it broke out into 3 lights.  She called me to let me know.  She has never seen anything like that and knows it wasn't just her and all those drivers around her were reacting to it too.;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277
Saucer spotted at an extremely low altitude, above neighbors' tree in the backyard.;2014-08-10 03:00:00;50-90 seconds;saucer spotted at an extremely low altitude, above neighbors tree in the backyard Flying saucer directly above neighbors tree.. Beams of light coming from the center of the disk..  White red and green lights all around the edges of the object.  It was almost like I was spotted because as I was watching this faint light it came down and hovered.   Then, as it lifted, it lifted one side of the craft higher than the other after swaying back and forth...  It was at a very low altitude maybe .. I think it came about 300 ft a above me..   I have always seen ships my whole life, but this was an extremely close encounter.  When the saucer came down, it was very slowly go from side to side from east to west almost rocking the vessel...   When it got down as close as it did, the vessel seemed to tilt upward so I could see the entire underbelly of the ship..  This was a very real experience I have been scared all night..;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277
