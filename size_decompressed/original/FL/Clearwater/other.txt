For 24 years I kept this to myself and for some reason I really want to report it now. - I try to be percise but this gets a little in depth, since I saw it twice. In 1987, while returning home, I spotted what I (now)believe to be an Event Horizon, approx 1ft in diameter, gliding next to the road approx 3 ft from the ground and 1ft from the road edge (Union st. 200yd east of N. highland Ave).  At first I believed the object was a smoke ring.  I was not on drugs or alcohol, but for some reason my thinking was and my reactions were slow, I had actually passed the object before the (for lack of a better term)  Wrongness of it registered.  There were no cars for it to have come from and it was not dissapating.  So I turned around and went back to look at it more closely.  I was about 2 ft from it when I realized it was no longer moving down the road, It had stopped moving and the circular formation of it was now directly facing me (I never saw it turn, it was facing me when I turned about).  It appeared to be a Haze, like vapor between glass panes.  I stared at it for about 30secs before I suddenly believed it was a reflection off my contacts.  I turned walked about 2 steps before I stopped myself.  I Have never seen a contact reflection and the object didnt move with my eyes.  So I turned and walked back to it.  It was still right where it had been.  I decided to touch it. I had just started to move my hand twards it, when I suddenly thought how uniportant it was, turned walked home. Sat in a chair turned on the TV and just watched my normal shows for about 15 minutes, when I suddenly stood and remembered what I had just seen.  I had no explaination for why I had suddenly forgotten the object walked away and continued on like I hadn't observed it.  I kinda believed I must have daydreamed it. But in June of 87 I saw it again. I was biking home from a friends house, when I came to the SE corner of Sunset Poind rd. and N.Belcher Dr.   When I saw it again.  It was the same size, the same distance off the ground, and the same distance from the road approx 20ft from the NW corner of the intersection.  I crossed N. Belcher and the Sunset Point Road.  I had no sooner hit the NW corner of the intersection ( determined to find out once and for all what this thing was). The next thing I knew I was fleeing up Sunset Point Road.  I was in full tilt running for my life mode, Run was all I could think of. Then I stopped.  The fear just went away.  I was on Peppermill dr and Sunset point road, and I just sat there stunned.  I did not go back.  I went home. I have never seen the object since that day. I do not know why after 24 years Im now reporting this.  Its been on my mind alot lately, which is strange since I barely spared it a thought for 20+ years.  I have no doubts about the accuracy of the events, just the dates are approximations. If this isnt the appropriate agency please forward it to the proper one.;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277
Heard loud low flying jet or aircraft pass over me. NO CRAFT!;2000-04-04 16:30:00;25 sec.;Heard loud low flying jet or aircraft pass over me. NO CRAFT! Walked out to driveway w/ daughter. Heard loud low flying jet or aircraft coming out of the southeast. I looked in that direction expecting to see a MacDill airforce jet heading northwest out to the gulf (they have never been know to do this). Will distress started to set in a the sound got louder. And I told my daughter, where is it! Where did it go..... As it seemed to fly over (according to the soundwave movement) me and my daughter could not see anything. I have a rather large and unblocked view. I felt rather shocked, like a feeling you might get when grasping thin breaking ropes climbing a cliff side. That's the best way I could describe that feeling. 100% roaring/sizzling/slightly muffled sound passing over and then no visual by me or my daughter.;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277

A jet flight came out from the storm flighting East to West (from Tampa to Clearwater over the bay)losing altitud to fast with a red lights on permanently, located under the pilot cabin and in the two wings.

ufo on clearwater beach;2011-02-11 02:00:00;1 minute;ufo on clearwater beach me and a close friend were on the beach around 1:30 in the morning when i noticed what i thought was a flock of birds over the water.  I pointed them out only to have my friend say there arent any birds out here at this time of night.  I trusted his judgement since he works at this location.  I looked harder at the object which in turn looked like a formation of triangles going in the same direction with a hazy, flag like outer shell that seemed to make an appearance of distortion due to heat.  Like a flag in the middle of the ocean, waving in the air. I still felt like it can be interpretated as birds or such until it disappeared behind a small cloud.  I thought to myself if it were birds, they would have came out thru the opposite side but it never happened.

Multi-colored fiery ball that created a tail like a meteor lasted 5 seconds and disappeared.  ((NUFORC Note:  Meteor?  PD));2015-11-16 21:15:00;5 seconds;Multi-colored fiery ball that created a tail like a meteor lasted 5 seconds and disappeared. I was just driving back home from work heading South on US 19.  Right in front of me, this streak of multi-colored brightness with a huge tail streaks across US 19 heading east to west towards Dunedin.  It was like a missile and it lasted for about 5 second and then just vanished.   It was flying at an angle that would suggest it falling and appeared the way you would think something would catch on fire and create a tail if you threw it.   It wasn't a reflection because I ALWAYS ride with my visor up on my helmet to let air flow in my face and I wear HD anti-reflective lenses in my glasses.   Upon telling my story on my facebook, it turns out that one of my co-workers who drives the same way home and was a minute in front of me saw it as well.  Could not have been firework due to size, angle, and demeanor.   We are very close to airports so I definitely saw planes in the sky as well.  I literally thought a plane was crashing or I was about to see a mushroom cloud on the ! horizon.  I was mentally preparing myself for a shockwave to hit me off my motorcycle.;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277

I saw a jet fighter approaching them. only no chem trail from the ufo jet!   the ufo jet started away and the fighter followed but could not keep up at all! I looked like the fighter jet was trying to strech it straight out, but the ufo jet was 2x or 3x the speed pulled ahead until it was gone. first time i've ever seen this awesome occurence.;27.9570607196971;-82.7510635227277

Then to the west of it there was another craft, white, no other lights moving fast , then it stopped once I raised my phone to take a picture, I have pictures of both.
