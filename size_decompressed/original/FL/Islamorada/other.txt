I was taking pictures of the highway ahead when I noticed what I thought was the moon to my upper left.  I panned my camera to that way while still keeping the highway in view and getting the moon in also to make the photo more interesting.  The moon was full 02-09-09, possible 3/4 02-13-09. Viewing my pictures this past weekend 03-08-09 my wife and I were surprised to see my moon photo as not the moon at all. I got 2 images of bowl shaped objects with 2 bright orbs a short distance above. I have zoomed in on the objects and the bowl shapes have a serrated gear edge on the flat part and the orbs have a diamond point.  Can you have my photo analyzed and let me know? emailing photo.;24.9216;-80.6339
