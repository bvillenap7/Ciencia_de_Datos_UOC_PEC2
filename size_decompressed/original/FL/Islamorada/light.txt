About 6:40 PM.  I was out with some friends watching sunset on my boat in Islamorada, FL.  It was one object but hard to actually tell the shape, if anything it looked sort of oval to my friends, but to me a little more rectangular.  It looked as if it was reflecting the sun off 2 parts of the fuselage (2 separate sections and both silver and sunset red in each section), but it didn’t seem to have lights.  At first we thought it was a plane (hence, my rectangular comment), but it had no flashing lights, or red lights, just what seemed to be the reflections.  The colors were consistent with the sunset we had just seen.  It moved right (southwest) at first then without hesitate, or any curve, move at about 90 degrees left of where it had been heading.  It then shot straight away from the earth and was out of sight in less than 10 seconds.  It faded to a little red spot and then to nothing.  We were looking due south from just north of Indian Waterways, mm 89 on US 1, on the bayside.  It was relatively close at first, about 1 mile away.  It wasn’t the shuttle, it goes across the sky, I’ve seen it and it takes minutes to traverse the entire sky line when it goes over.  I’ve seen military and shuttle rocket launches too.  Not the same thing and much faster and no sound.;24.9216;-80.6339
