The sun had not set yet.  While looking at the moon I noticed a sliver of light (reflection from the sun), approximately ½ to ¾ inch long moving toward the moon.  I thought it was unusual because there was no vapor trail (I thought it was a plane).  I kept watching it to see what it would look like in front of the moon.  As it approached the moon and began crossing the moon it grew smaller and smaller, and then I realized it was going behind the moon!  I kept watching to see if it would come out the other side, but it never did.  It simply disappeared.  Now that I think about it, it could not have been a plane because at that distance you would not have seen it.  The fact that it was the size I mentioned means it must have been a huge aircraft of some type.;29.5739;-82.1075
