White, triangular object (shaped like a long, narrow paper airplane) observed moving silently in broad daylight.;1996-07-30 14:00:00;1.5 minutes;White, triangular object (shaped like a long, narrow paper airplane) observed moving silently in broad daylight. This sighting took place so long ago that I’m not sure of the exact date.  However, it was the summer (approximately July or August) of 1995 or 1996 and took place in Crestview, Florida. I was in the backyard with my grandson when I looked up and saw an object in the sky.  It was solid white (at least I don’t remember any markings or lights) and triangular in shape.  It was long and narrow, looking about the shape of the long paper airplanes we made as kids.  It was moving very slowly and completely silently. I watched for a moment and then looked down to tell my grandson to look up.  When we both looked up, the object was gone.  It was broad daylight and the sky was completely clear with no clouds into which it could have disappeared.  I could not have taken my eyes off of it for more than a few seconds.  It would have had to move at a tremendous speed to disappear in that time.  I’ll never forgive myself for looking away and not seeing how it left. A few minutes later a small aircraft flew over at approximately the same height as the object (maybe a bit lower), and I could clearly hear the airplane engines.  The object had made no sound at all. I haven’t mentioned this incident to anyone but my family, and my grandson was much too young to remember it.  I was afraid to be labeled a kook because of the many “sightings” that have been reported in Gulf Breeze, Florida, over the years.  Gulf Breeze is only about 20 miles from Crestview as the crow flies. I haven’t read or seen any accounts of objects that were shaped exactly like the one I saw.  If you have had reports of anything like it, I would greatly appreciate your letting me know. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

White flashes in the sky and a triangular craft with three red lights.;2014-04-10 08:30:00;Few minutes;White flashes in the sky and a triangular craft with three red lights. I was looking up at the stars in my backyard for several minutes when I kept noticing random flashes of white light it the sky.   The flashes were too fast to be a shooting star, and came too close to my house to be a shooting star.   By then I was intently looking at the sky to find some sort of explanation, when I saw a triangular shaped cloudy craft with three distinct faint red lights at each point of the craft.   The object was entirely silent and shot across the sky and disappeared behind the tree line.  Seconds later I saw one more flash through the trees where the plane disappeared.;30.7713352941176;-86.5233852941176

Upon seeing the object I was a little startled because it had no sound. It took a second to realise that it wasn't making any noise.  Once I came to the realisation that it wasn't making any noise, I grabbed my phone and ran to the end of my driveway in hopes of getting a video.  I guess I was so startled by the fact that it changed direction almost instantly that I didn't hit record.  Once it cleared the tree line you could visibly see it was triangular in shape since we had some bad weather and lightning was lighting up the sky every 15-30 second.  It made almost a 90 degree turn to the left and continued to the East.  It was very low flying and just cruising.;30.7713352941176;-86.5233852941176
