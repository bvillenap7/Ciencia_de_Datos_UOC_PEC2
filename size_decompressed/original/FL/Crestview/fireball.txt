6 UFOs and alien noises in neighborhood.;2020-07-04 21:30:00;5 minutes;6 UFOs and alien noises in neighborhood. My wife and I were walking our neighborhood watching fireworks.  Just after dark I noticed 2 flickering firey globes moving in an unusual pattern, just over our local airport. My wife thought they were firework burnoff pieces until 4 more appeared and we realized they had other lights ,and were all the same shape.  They were moving about the speed of a helicopter, and their light was bright enough to cast a glow.  I would guess they would have been 4 times the size of a large truck.  They appeared to become translucent before becoming completely invisible. Right after they disappeared, a sharp noise made both of us duck.  The noise pierced our ears about 3 or 4 more times.  The sound was almost painful.;30.7713352941176;-86.5233852941176
