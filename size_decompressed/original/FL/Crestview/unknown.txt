Orange/Yellow flickering light in the sky with no sound and abrupt changes in direction, below 12,000 feet.;2010-01-01 00:25:00;2 minutes;Orange/Yellow flickering light in the sky with no sound and abrupt changes in direction, below 12,000 feet. Noticed a light approaching from the WSW fairly slowly, we were on US Highway 90 west of Crestview, just west of Lee Farms Subdivision.  At first I thought it was a Satellite so as we drove (next 20-30 seconds) for it to pass above the clouds.  It did not so at that time we pulled over and I opened the sun roof as it was passing overhead then, it made a very abrupt 180 degree turn and proceeded back towards where we first sited it then made a 90 degree trun to the left (South to Southeast) and then disappeared. I am very involved in the aerospace industry and experienced aircraft observer (night and day), there were no red or green navigation lights, no white strobes, no flashing lights at all, it was a flickering orange yellow light that reminded us of flame whichis reason we thought it was a satellite at first.  With the windows down and sunroof open we heard no sounds at all.  The clouds were scattered and broken at 12,000 ft.  The main reason I am reporting this is because of the extemely abrupt reverse course, and no noise.
