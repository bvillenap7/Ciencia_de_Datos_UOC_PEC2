Cylinder shaped with flashing lights at top and bottom. I was standing outside in my driveway when I noticed A large metallic, cylinder shaped object about 3.5 to 4 miles away. I ran inside to get my video cam. to film it but the batteries were dead. I then went back outside to find it. It was still in the same place as before but had what seemed to be bright white lights coming from it. A jet then flew over my head. I turned back to look for it but it was gone. It was very sunny outside so it was a little hard to look at it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Source is a middle school student.  PD));30.7713352941176;-86.5233852941176
