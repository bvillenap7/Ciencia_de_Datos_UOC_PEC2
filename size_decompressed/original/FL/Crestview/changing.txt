Bright light that changed color and shape near aircraft with contrail in daylight;2008-04-17 18:30:00;5min;Bright light that changed color and shape near aircraft with contrail in daylight It was April 17, 2008 at 1830 still light outside.I was coming home from work driving down hwy 85 towards Crestview, Florida. I was about 2 miles away from Duke Field AFB when I noticed a bright light in the sky off to the left from my frame of vision. I watched it for a few seconds thinking it was a reflection of the sun off a jetliner. As I watched the object it began to change colors and turned orange/yellow while moving up and down slightly more pronounced then hovering.  The object then turned a red/ orange for a few seconds and then to black in the shape of a vertical line or sideways oval, then vanished. I began to look for the light again while driving and noticed in the distance of the general direction of the first event there was what looked like an air craft with contrails coming off of it ( like the tails of comets) usually the aircraft engines can produce this kids of contrail that is a V formation out the back of the craft but this one I saw was not, it was forming a U with the contrail, which I also thought was odd, it had to be a wide aircraft.  While watching the new craft the light came back next to it, it again started out a bright white light, then turned two different shades of orange/ red and then black before vanishing. I have lived in this area 16 years. I have lived on the AFB and worked on all 3 of the bases whe have here,I have seen many different type of air craft over the years, but I have never seen anything like this here before.
