Slow moving from North to south parallel 1 mile from hwy 85 toward Crestview headed to Eglin AFB.  Was dull intense orange round sphere light was coming from object evenly-there were no lights that were individual light source such as NAV lights.  At the base of the object was intense red lumination-again all light was glowing with no conventional light source.  The object was about 200 feet directly above my location and was at least 30 feet in diameter.  The object had no sound at all no blinking light-light glowed from object orange on sphere and red on base.;30.7713352941176;-86.5233852941176
