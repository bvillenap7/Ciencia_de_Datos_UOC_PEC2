White Triangle in South Florida.;2014-12-17 17:19:00;5-10 seconds;White Triangle in South Florida My co-workers and I work in the next own over.  After  our shift we were headed back to our homes, we car pool together, all 11 of us in company van.  About 5 minutes before entering LaBelle, FL. (the city we live in) while driving North on State Road 29, I was looking at the sky and almost as if out of nowhere a White Triangular craft manifested itself through the clouds in the East.  I yelled to my co- workers Ovni! OVNI!!!!! ( Which is Spanish for UFO). Everyone immediately looked up and it almost seemed as if time, inside the van, slowed down immensely.  I felt as if the van was just smoothly floating down the road. A few seconds went by, (5-10 by my estimation) and after moving a few miles to the West, the craft disappeared into nothing.  As if it just collapsed into itself and it was gone.   I've always heard of black triangular shaped crafts, but never a white one, which just added to the strangeness.  This one had many of the same characteristics as its black counter parts.  It was totally silent, it showed no exhaust system, and it seemed to defy the laws of aerodynamics gliding  flawlessly through the air at a slow speed. It's hard for me to be sure of it's exact size, since I have no reference points to do the trigonometry, but if I had to estimate it's size, I would say it is somewhere in between 35-40 ft in length, from the front tip to the back of the craft and 25-35 ft in maximum width from one of the back corners to the other. I realize this is much smaller than the black triangles that have been reported, which is also a bit strange.  I don't know if the two have anything in common besides the obvious, I just hope more people see it.;26.7313111111111;-81.4339444444445
