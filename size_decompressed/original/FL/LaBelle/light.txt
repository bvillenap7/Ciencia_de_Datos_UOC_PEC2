THEY WERE UNUSUALLY BRIGHT AT FIRST. AS I STARED AT THEM I LOOK FOR BLINKING LIGHTS OF A PLAE OR COPTER, BUT THERE WERE NONE,  JUST THE FRIGHT BLUISH INTENSE LIGHT.   I THOUGHT IT WAS ORION BEING PARTIALLY BLOCKED BY A CLOUD, BUT THERE WERE NO CLOUDS IN THE SKY, THERE THEY SAT IN THE SKY TWO ANOMALIES, AS I SLOWED DOND TO TRY TO TAKE A PHOTO THE LIGHTS BEGAN TO SLOWLY DIM TOGETHER AND IN 10 SECONDS THEY DISSAPEARED, AGAIN IT FELT AS THEY WENT BEHING A CLOUD BUT THE SKY WAS COMPLETELY CLEAR, IT WAS SO WEIRD!!!;26.7313111111111;-81.4339444444445
