UFO Over Bunnell/Palm Coast, FL.;2013-11-07 20:00:00;<1 hour;UFO Over Bunnell/Palm Coast, FL. I saw what appeared to be an overly bright star not seemingly far from the moon (Beneath it).  It caught my attention for being overly bright, so I looked over at it several times on a 5 mile trip. While at a friends home, more than one helicopter kept making circles around the local area about 15 minutes after my arrival. I left his home after about a half hour.  That's when I saw that the bright star, was gone but the moon was relatively in the same location in the sky. I also noticed that there was not just 1 helicopter but 5-8 helicopters and or drones flying over the area of Bunnell and Palm Coast, FL, in a search pattern where I thought I saw the overly bright star shortly before.;29.4581;-81.3271
Bright green light traveling slowly.;2015-02-21 23:00:00;30 seconds;Bright green light traveling slowly. I was sitting at my desk and the only light was from my phone when the blinds lit up bright green.   I got up and looked out the window to see a bright green ball with a very large green hue surrounding it in the western sky traveling from the south to the north.  It was not traveling at a great speed but after about 30 seconds it disappeared over the tree line.   It was not shooting down, but actually flying over the tree line about a mile from me.  The sky was cloudy and very dark.   No sound was emitted or any bursts of light after it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
