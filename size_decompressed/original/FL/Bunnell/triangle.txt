It caught my eye and as I watched it got bigger, as I kept driving the long light turned into three distinctive lights. Imagine a triangle and there was a light on the tip, and one light on the center of each side. The lights were extremely large, like the BP logo. I stopped my car when I was right under it and turned down my music there was no noise coming from it, it also wasn't moving, and if it was moving it was moving so slow that the eye couldn't tell. Comparing 10 degrees in the sky to the width of my fist, the object was approximately 70 degrees high. I was traveling east and as I was traveling the object moved very slowly 50 degrees north, and then back again. I can't really say how big it was but I do remember the width of the object going over the sides of the two lane road. Once I realized what it was I drove away and when I looked back it was gone. The whole way down the road I felt like I was being watched, and I got physical effects from the whole experience, my arms when numb and my jaw was chattering I felt icy-hot sweaty palms. It was an extremely large object.;29.4581;-81.3271
