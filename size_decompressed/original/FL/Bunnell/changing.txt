My son who is 12 witnessed all because he was up late in the living room watching TV and he was pretty freaked out because he witnessed all this for the first time ever, i being 33 have had little sightings that i wrote off as trick of the eye or just never reported but this time with the power going out and the flash of light with the sighting was all too much not to report thank you for being here for us to do so.;29.4581;-81.3271
