Facing east look up and towards north, notice something moving. Watching as object nears to overhead, it is now obvious shape of object  is cylindrical and shiney silver.  Call to 2nd observer to look up.  I  begin counting and as I get to &quot5&quot, first object is past trees (out of  my sight) and second object (same as first) comes into my view from  same direction (north going south).  I begin counting again and when I  get to &quot5&quot second object is past trees and third object (same as the  first two) comes into view.  I beging counting again but there were  only these three cylinder shaped objects.  The third (and final)  cylinder had what looked like a red light or something red that  appeared very bright on top.  All three objects were same shape and  size and very shiney silver.  There were no wings, no noise, no  flashing lights.  Holding my arm straight at about 80-degrees, the  objects would have been about one inch in length. 27.078653,-82.367592 - where I was standing   The objects were traveling north to south and would be over the Gulf of  Mexico.;27.0707514563106;-82.3730087378641
