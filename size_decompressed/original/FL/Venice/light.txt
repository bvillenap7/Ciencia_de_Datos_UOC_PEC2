Fire Red color Light;2011-11-03 19:30:00;5 minutes;Fire Red color Light On the night of 11/3/2011,my wife came home stated that she had seen a ufo when driving home from her friends house.  So I stepped outside to see if I could catch a glimpse of what she might have seen.   My wife told me she saw it to the west so I wasn't out there for a minute and then I saw the following saw one, then two, then three and the fire like lights all blinked out at once.   Then we saw three again much further to the west.  They also blinked out at the same time.  Then we saw one light appear, then two, three, four, five, six and seven until there were seven.  The lights at first looked like flares but flares don't jump over in a straight line and then jump again.  You could see the jump as it left a kind of trail.  Then my wife went in side when we saw no more activity and,I stayed outside for a bit longer and saw white light slowly move across the sky under the moon moving south west direction I ran to get my wife and in 2 sec I ran to get her the object was gone.;27.0707514563106;-82.3730087378641
Orange-red lights out over Gulf near Venice, FL;2011-11-03 19:30:00;5 min.;Orange-red lights out over Gulf near Venice, FL On the evening of Nov. 3, 2011, my husband and I were riding our motorcycle north on Casey Key Road, just north of Venice, FL.  I kept looking out over the Gulf and noticing an orange-red spherical light in the sky.  I told my husband to stop in a spot where we had a clear view out over the Gulf.  We both witnessed 3 orange-red lights in a triangular formation.  They would appear for several seconds and then fade out.  At one point all three lights were showing at the same time then one would fade out and then another fade out.  They appeared stationary while we were watching.  Eventually we saw the same type light farther out near the horizon until all the lights faded away.  There was no noise, no strobe blinking like an aircraft.  We’ve never seen anything like it.  We watched for about 5 minutes.;27.0707514563106;-82.3730087378641
Numerous objects with steady white and blinking red lights launched over Gulf with high trajectory path to west over Venice jetty;2011-12-17 18:30:00;30 minutes;Numerous objects with steady white and blinking red lights launched over Gulf with high trajectory path to west over Venice jetty While facing northwest over Venice jetty observed object with steady white and blinking red light appear to be launched from point north.  Object followed altitude-gaining trajectory while moving south, then turned west. Lights disappeared after object reached very high altitude and turned west. At least fifteen other identical objects followed exact same path at 20-60 second intervals, seemingly being launched from shoreline or water.  Objects were silent and sometimes three or four were visible at once, all originating from location that could not be identified from our vantage point on Venice Beach. At first we thought them to be small airplanes or helicopters, but trajectory, flight, frequency and location disproved that.  Called Venice airport and newsroom, but could not get any information on what these objects were.;27.0707514563106;-82.3730087378641
Orange lights with deliberate movements spotted several times over the course of 3 hours.;2015-06-21 21:30:00;10 minutes;Orange lights with deliberate movements spotted several times over the course of 3 hours. Saw 3 orange lights rise in a triangle formation, move slightly, then disappear at different times. An hour later, a mile away, saw a single orange light over the gulf of Mexico at Manasota Beach.  The light moved up, down, left and right before disappearing.  10 minutes later, a similar light appeared farther out to sea.  It made deliberate movements in all directions before once again disappearing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

UFO spotting in Venice lights.;2016-11-26 19:27:00;19:27-20:14;UFO spotting in Venice lights I observed a light that seemed to move and change color almost ranging from a circle to a triangular shape.  I then asked my father to come outside to observe he said it is a planet that is visible recently has been there for at least a week.  I was not convinced because I witnessed horizontal and vertical movement of light.  Although it seemed to be in the same place for around 30 minutes, I recorded video when it's zoomed you can see the movement. To be sure it was moving I took a photo of light with my phone resting on a wall and marked the wall to be sure each photo was taken at the exact same position.  This proved movement.  I went in my fathers house for 10 minutes or so and the light was gone.  I walked approximately 50 feet to me vehicle and observed the light in a new position over a home.  At this point movement and color change from greens,blue,red and yellow were visible with the naked eye.  Then it quickly disappeared upward out of sight.  In addition! during the whole time 3 airplanes were visibly flying near object, and circled multiple times.;27.0707514563106;-82.3730087378641

Enormous string made of light instantly appeared and vanished;2021-04-29 22:00:00;5 seconds;Enormous string made of light instantly appeared and vanished It was a spring night and my father and I were walking around the block before going to bed. We were within sight of home to finish the walk and enjoying a nice chat. We both have an interest in UFOs, space, aliens, and engineering. My dad is a petroleum engineer and I am a mechanical engineer. My grandfather and dad’s father was an electric engineer and did work on the Apollo Project in a contractor capacity.  There was a lull in the conversation about a range of subjects which did sometimes include space and UFO type mutual interests. We were both looking up at the sky approx 70 degrees up walking southward and 20 degrees to the west when we suddenly saw something neither of us have ever seen in the sky before. The craft or object appeared like a very large (bigger than most airplanes visible in the airspace normally by a factor greater than 10) string made out of light. It remained visible for approximately 2 seconds and completely disappeared. We both said, “DID you see THAT!?” because it was such a clear and exciting thing to witness. We spent the remainder of the walk describing to each other the exact same craft/phenomena we both witnessed.  There were no negative effects of the encounter and it was just a cool thing to witness firsthand. I definitely cannot think of any “rational” explanation or mistaken identity for what we witnessed besides a hologram or advanced light craft.;27.0707514563106;-82.3730087378641
