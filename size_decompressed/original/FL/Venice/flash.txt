Two separate flashes across the sky on 11-08 lunar eclipse seen from our driveway around 8pm-8:30pm;2003-11-08 20:00:00;seconds;Two separate flashes across the sky on 11-08 lunar eclipse seen from our driveway around 8pm-8:30pm My husband and I were sitting in our driveway, looking at the eclipse...my husband saw what he thought was a shooting star go across the sky from west to east..my view was obstructed by a tree in our yard. Shortly after that, he saw a second flash across the sky...he again said he saw a shooting star. I didn't think anything of it, until I heard tell on the radio show, and then going on your site and seeing all the folks telling of their different sightings that night. What he saw was just a flash of light, and not a string of lights or flock of birds with lights... in his sighting. He may have just seen a shooting star as thought at the time.;27.0707514563106;-82.3730087378641
