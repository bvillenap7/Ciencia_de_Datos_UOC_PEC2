We were outside sitting on the porch at 7:00 pm when we saw many ufo's go through the air they all went in the same direction and 3 formed an isosceles triangle and then formed a line.  They were glowing objects.  They all traveled in a line on different little clusters and some solo.  Eventually they floated into the distance.  I have pictures.;27.0707514563106;-82.3730087378641
