Triangular craft spotted over Venice, FL;2003-10-17 19:30:00;2 minutes;Triangular craft spotted over Venice, FL While stopped at a traffic light at the intersection of Jacaranda Blvd. and Rt. 776, I noticed a triangular shaped craft heading due west.  It was flying quite low at about 5,000-7,000 feet.  It was a cool night and I had the window open and there was no noticeable sound.  Although the sky had darkened, there was still enough light left to see that there was no vapor trail behind it.  It was definitely a triangle with 2 blinking slivery-blue lights on 2 of the apices and one white light on the front apex.  The 2 other lights blinked in synch with each other.  I am familiar with the usual flight patterns around here.  I also know that the airport in Venice, FL is only for small private plane.  This craft was not coming in for a landing as there is no airport in the direction in which is was heading.  Also there was no airport it could have taken off from that could explain its really low altitude.  I could tell it was black in color from what little light was left in the sky.  This thing must've been seen by many others in that area because the intersection was really busy with traffic.  The fact that there was no sound and no vapor trail, its low altitude and relatively slow speed moving from east to west toward the Gulf tells me that this was no ordinary craft.;27.0707514563106;-82.3730087378641

About 8:30 pm I witnessed a large black triangle silently fly NW-SE near the Venice Fl. Airport.;2019-09-25 20:30:00;30-45 seconds;About 8:30 pm I witnessed a large black triangle silently fly NW-SE near the Venice Fl. Airport.  I have seen B2 stealth bombers fly before, and this craft appeared larger and more equilateral than that, although the sighting lasted only a few seconds.;27.0707514563106;-82.3730087378641
About 8:20 pm I witnessed a large black triangle, approx. 30-35 feet wide, silently fly NW-SE near the Venice Fl. Airport.;2019-09-27 10:20:00;10 seconds;About 8:20 pm I witnessed a large black triangle, approx. 30-35 feet wide, silently fly NW-SE near the Venice Fl. Airport. On fri, 9/27/2019 at 8:20p.m. I witnessed a triangle shaped craft approx. 30’-35’ in length/width fly NW – SE over the Venice Fl. Airport.  At first I thought it might be a B2, but the B2 makes noise and has an exhaust trail, the B2 is also kind of bat-shaped.  This craft was silent, black, a more equilateral triangle shape, had zero exhaust or visible engines of any kind and was flying very slowly.   I watched it for about 10-15 seconds.  After doing some research online I found something called the “TR-3B” recently patented by the U.S.Navy that uses something called “rotating electrostatic drive”.  They claim it hasn’t actually been built…;27.0707514563106;-82.3730087378641
