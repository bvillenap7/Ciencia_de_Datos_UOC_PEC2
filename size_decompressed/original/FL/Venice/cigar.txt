Bouncing Ball follows car in Venice Florida;1997-06-30 05:45:00;10 minutes;Bouncing Ball follows car in Venice Florida I am a registered nurse with a masters degree and never really thought about UFO’s nor had I ever read anything  about them. In 1997 while driving to work from Venice, FL, to North Port, FL, via Rt. 41 around 5:45 a.m., I saw in my rear view mirror a light that had just entered the road behind me.  I remember thinking that it was funny that a car would pull out from this wooded area since there is no road or driveway.  It was very dark out but from driving this road every day.  I was aware that there were no roads on that side of the road. Suddenly, the orb which I had assumed was a vehicle light disappeared from behind me, but then noted in my passenger side mirror that this orb ( the color was slightly more yellowish than a clear headlight) was following directly to the right of my vehicle.  This orb followed me along the road for approximately 5 miles bouncing along the right  side of my car.  I also remember  thinking that it looked like the bouncing ball on the old  Mitch Miller show.  I then remember thinking maybe this was a UFO, but from anything I had ever seen on TV, this was not a UFO vehicle, and my radio was playing and the car was running so I  just couldn’t figure out what this was. Then in the fall of 2004 ( October or November), I was again driving in the early morning, around 5: 15 a.m.,  I was driving south on Interstate 75 and was near the Kings Highway exit on the interstate, when suddenly to my left and up approximately 300 feet (estimate), I saw this very large plane like object.  It flew directly to the left of me and it looked like a large jumbo jet but without wings.  It was silent, and I saw no lights on this object.  I felt it was a plane that was about to crash because it was so low to the ground and now just 50-100 feet above the road and to my left.   It passed me and I looked in the mirror expecting to see a large explosion/smoke or some evidence of a crash but there was nothing.  I could no longer see anything as the sky was dark.  Again I did not lose any power to my car or radio. I picked up a co-worker in Punta Gorda and continued to travel south to Estero, Fl., that morning, and saw nothing more but did mention my sighting to my co worker, and she just laughed. We returned home the following night (Sunday) around midnight, and about 10 miles south of Punta Gorda, we both witnessed another bright orb like object high in the sky.  We watched this for about a minute and it didn’t seem to move, then suddenly it was gone.  We did not see it move, it was just there one moment and gone the next.  Shortly afterwards as we were exiting the highway to return to her house, she looked at her watch and commented that it was much later than it should be  when we arrived back.  It seemed to take us approx 45 minutes longer to make the trip from Estero to Punta Gorda that night. I had kept these 2 sightings to myself all this time until I mentioned something to my sister in law recently, and it was she who said that round orbs have been reported in the past as UFO’s. I then found your web sight for reporting any sightings, and felt that perhaps this may be significant, even though it has been quite sometime ago.
