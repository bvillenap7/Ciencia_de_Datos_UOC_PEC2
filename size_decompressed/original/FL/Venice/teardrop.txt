Bright White/Orange teardrop turned starburst light moving slowly before changing directions twice and speeding off.;2020-07-29 04:19:00;5 minutes;Bright White/Orange teardrop turned starburst light moving slowly before changing directions twice and speeding off. My husband and I were sitting on our front porch facing North. I noticed this blinding light just hovering in the sky.  As I tried to focus my eyes on it, it seemed to change from white to orange and then took on an asterisk/starburst effect as it moved very slowly away from us as if it was using the tree in our yard to hide.  When we got up to move down the driveway to see it better, it began moving slowly east.  I tried to pull out my phone to get it on camera but you can only see a tiny dot of light.  Then it started speeding to the west before we lost sight of it.  We are in a small neighborhood with a lot of trees and our house obscured our view at the end.;27.0707514563106;-82.3730087378641
