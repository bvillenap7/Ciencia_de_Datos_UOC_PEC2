Large bright circular object hovered for 20 minutes then moved off North Northwest at a very slow speed.;2007-07-11 22:00:00;20 Minutes;Large bright circular object hovered for 20 minutes then moved off North Northwest at a very slow speed. While taking out the garbage for next day curbside pickup at 22:00 hour (10:00 PM) on 07/11/2007, I spotted a very bright light in the sky in the direction of the Venice Municipal Airport in Venice, Florida.. It first appeared to be a planet like object similar to Venus in the night sky however, much larger and brighter. I stood starring for about 5 minutes until I realized it was moving away from me as it began to drop below the tree top level.  I ran inside to get my binoculars and returned. It had moved only slightly. Viewing it through 6 X 30 binoculars proved it was not an aircraft (I see small aircraft with their red and green running lights every day & night since the Venice Airport is home to many private craft including jet aircraft).  Although in the direction of the airport I could easily determine that it was well beyond since I could see small craft landing during the event. I then decided to take a picture and ran back in the house a second time for the digital camera. By this time the object had moved some distance from the original sighting position so the pictures were barely discernible. I ran the pictured through my graphics software enhancing the object. It was circular in shape and emitted a bright glowing light as if it were a glowing white ball and appeared to be much larger than the small craft flying in the area. The event lasted approximately 15 minutes.  Over the years I have seen many of these kinds of object including bright orange circular craft as well as black triangular craft beginning in 1955 to present. I have many UFO stories much stranger than this sighting.  Picture & map to follow by email.;27.0707514563106;-82.3730087378641
Orange spheres floating across sky in Venice, FL.;2012-12-16 18:20:00;10 minutes;Orange spheres floating across sky in Venice, FL. Initially saw 6 spheres in sky, spaced apart, drifting slowly from West to East coming from the water, over Dona Bay.  Just disappeared (thought may have went behind a cloud), then saw 2-3 more at a time come from behind the tree line, lower and moving quicker.  Had a central yellow steady light, with a orange-red glow in a spherical shape.  No sound.  Sky was very clear, no wind.   Entire event lasted about 10 minutes.;27.0707514563106;-82.3730087378641

Heading West faster than any plane/jet can travel @ 12-1500 feet.  The object brightened, but never blinked.  Just stayed orange.;27.0707514563106;-82.3730087378641
