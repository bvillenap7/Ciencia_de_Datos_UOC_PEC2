While driving south on I-75 in SW Florida, I spotted a bright pea sized oval object in the early morning sky. It was just after sunrise and it apeared directly ahead of me at 45 degrees, roughly 10,000 feet altitude and stationary. I watched it for 10 seconds then it faded out. Within 1 second it or another object reapeared about 20 degrees to the right at the same altitude, but this time it was moving slowly to the left for about 30 seconds. Then, with an extremely bright flash it vanished. Seconds before the flash, the object looked like two ovals connected side to side. Initially I had considered the objects to be satillites reflecting the sunrise, until the object changed it's course.;27.0707514563106;-82.3730087378641

Suddenly, it stopped.   Then the fireworks started at the beach, we looked back to see what the ball was doing and it took off away so fast and then dissappeard.;27.0707514563106;-82.3730087378641

Saw approx. 15 or more ufo,s moving east to west over Venice Florida around 20:00 8pm. Their color was red only, moving against a cold front very slowly and not very high in the sky. No other lights or sounds were noted.  Watched the red ufo,s for about 20 or 30 mins moving to the west to the Gulf of Mexico.  Three other people watched with me, we all asked, What is that?.  They were moving in the clouds against the wind and we were only able to see the red lights when they were out of the clouds banks.  Again there was no sound and no other lights as a plane would have. It was odd that they were moving so slow in rows of two, one higher than the other as the UFOs pasted by heading to the Gulf of Mexico.;27.0707514563106;-82.3730087378641

Scanning to the Southwest toward Venus a bright object moving fast toward the Southeast was noticed.  Began following just below Ursa Major tracking to the Southeast. The object was moving very quickly across sky with steady white light with the naked eye.  My wife was taking pictures of the Moon at the time so I was able to get her to take a pic and 7sec video with our digital camera.;27.0707514563106;-82.3730087378641
