Anyway, I was pregnant with my son he is now 13 years old so the sighting had to be in 1999.    My son’s father, his uncle and I were all out at the jetties  “a place in Venice” fishing.  It was very late and I was tired and wanted to go home. My son’s father wanted to stay so I walked up onto the bench they had by the snack shop to lie down.  I was looking out towards my son’s father and uncle as they were fishing and out of nowhere I saw this HUGE and I mean HUGE saucer it had if I remember correctly red and white lights going around the bottom of it. It made no sound at all. It was very close to the top of the trees.  I got up and walked down onto the dock where my son’s father and Uncle were and we all 3 stood there staring at this thing and then it disappeared.   My son’s father said the light were red and like fireballs.  I remember red and white. It was strange and honestly I don’t remember too much after that. I did call my mom right away she said I called around 2am from a payphone and she said I told her all about it.  I know that was a UFO. I have NEVER seen anything like that before.  I was not scared when I saw it, none of us were, and we just stared at it until it vanished.   After I called my mom and told her about it, I’m not sure how to explain it but I don’t really remember much after that.  I do know I saw a huge space ship with red and white lights and it was amazing to me that it made no sound what so ever.;27.0707514563106;-82.3730087378641
Could not hear any sounds coming from objects, it was dark, tried binoculars, couldn't bring into focus.;2016-03-11 21:00:00;10 minutes;Could not hear any sounds coming from objects, it was dark, tried binoculars, couldn't bring into focus. Bright orange orbs would arise from horizon, then disappear behind clouds.  There was a helicopter flying in sky, could hear that clearly.  Heard and saw plane fly in sky also.;27.0707514563106;-82.3730087378641
