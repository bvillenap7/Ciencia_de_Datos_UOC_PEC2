Outside in our back yard a little after 7 we saw a bright green flash traveling across the sky.  At first we thought it was a shooting start but then it split into smaller little flashes of light almost like a fire work that was moving slowly, horizontally across the sky.  It slowed down and seemed to regroup back into a ball and then disappeared! It was so freaky.;26.2641090753424;-80.1961282534248
