Object was traveling notheast .   I pulled over as I thought it was an aircraft about to make an emergency landing on roadway & got out of my vehicle to observe.I then saw it was about 20 times larger then a airplane and was shaped like a flat top straw hat & looked to be metallic.  At least 50 times the size of a full moon's appearance in the sky.  The upper portion or cabin had windows all around with light on inside which reflected out on to the deck portion giving me an excellent view. It was low and slow flying.  About 300 to 400 feet high.   I watched it travel at  that same steady slow speed for a few minutes until it went out of sight due to surrounding area  of trees & homes.  No tall buildings were in area.   Returned to my vehicle & drove a few blocks  and relocated flying in sn same direction & speed until I lost sight ! of it again.
