Bright oval light hovering over Ft. Lauderdale on  Dec. 2, 2011;2011-12-02 21:30:00;1 hour;bright oval light hovering over Ft. Lauderdale on  Dec. 2, 2011 On friday night, Dec 2,2011, about 9:15pm, I seen a bright white light, kinda oval shaped hovering over Ft.Lauderdale/Sunrise/Pompano Bch area.  It was about as high as a ten story building and it was not a plane/helicopter/blimp!   As I watched it form my 6th story balcony, the light dimmed, as if it went into a cloud or was flying away, then it shot across the sky,not to far but far enough, and the bright light came back and it began to hover again. It did this twice, that I saw. Then it started to move slowly, horizontally through the sky. I lost track of it because of the way my building is situtated. I tried to use my camera phone, but its not a smart phone so it didnt work.   I,ve been checking on-line and no one has reported anything!! Is there anyway to find out what it was?  There was planes flying high above, someone else had to have seen this!;26.2641090753424;-80.1961282534248

Green lighted UFO spotted over fireworks display.;2014-07-04 21:00:00;10-15 minutes;Green lighted UFO spotted over fireworks display. A fireworks display was held on the Atlantic Avenue pier in Pompano Beach and my 4th floor condo faces east so I had a perfect view.  I went out onto my balcony to watch.   Obviously, I was looking up to see the fireworks when a very bright green light caught my attention.  It was small and difficult to make out at first and it was completely still.  It seemed to also be watching the fireworks display although it seemed like it was very high up in the sky.  I couldn’t stop looking at it because of the intensity of the color.  It eventually moved back and forth a little bit and I could see a red light right in the center of the green lights.  It also became a little larger and I could see that the green lights were not like one would see on an airplane.  Besides, this craft seemed round or saucer shaped so definitely not an airplane.  The best way I can describe it is that it was like looking at the top of a carousel with the green lights going round and round really fa! st.  The way the craft moved also made it highly unlikely this was something that originated on this planet. There were no turns to change direction, like an airplane would have to make. I took some pictures with my Samsung Galaxy 3 but they aren’t very good as this craft was so high in the sky.  Eventually the craft started to move south as the fireworks display was ending.  I was sad to see it go as it seemed to be enjoying the fireworks.  I have never seen a UFO before and this has really had an impact on me.  I don’t understand why I felt so sad to see it leave and now I am anxious to see it in the night sky again perhaps tonight or sometime soon.;26.2641090753424;-80.1961282534248
Something was releasing sparks, one craft disappears at high rate of speed then other craft stayed with a fire halo.  Caught on video.;2019-05-04 03:00:00;3 seconds;Something was releasing sparks  ,one craft disappears at high rate of speed then other craft stayed with a fire halo.  Caught on video Driving home at 3am from work and noticed what it appeared to be a common meteor burning in the atmosphere.  After a few seconds of looking at it, I noticed something was off.  There was many sparks raining from this object similar to fireworks..  I pulled over immediately and tried to get a video on my phone.  The sparks stopped and i was able to see 2 stationary objects where the sparks came from.  One immediately after flew at high rate of speed towards the east.  I am familiar to the speed of military aircraft as i attend many shows, but this object was unbelievable fast.. faster than any f22s i have seen.  No engine sounds emitted from the crafts, it was very quiet night, it would have been obvious if it was plane or helicopter..  Soon after the second craft appeared again  and this time is looked like it had a halo of fire around it.  The craft was in this state of fire for a few seconds and then the fire stopped.  I can see a small light emitted by the cr! aft as it proceeded to make some incredible fast and agile maneuvers before disappearing into the darkness.  I got video proof of the fire event of the second craft as this time i was ready to film as soon as it began.;26.2641090753424;-80.1961282534248
