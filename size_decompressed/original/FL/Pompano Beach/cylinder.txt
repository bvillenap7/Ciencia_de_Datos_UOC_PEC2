Strange blue cylindrical lights flying in from Ocean;2008-12-18 21:20:00;1 second;Strange blue cylindrical lights flying in from Ocean At approximately 9:20 pm while walking in a Westerly direction 3 blocks from the Ocean in Pompano Beach, Florida I witnessed flying between two clouds 2 cylindrical shaped objects traveling so fast that if I had blinked I would have missed it. They were flying in formation and appeared to be as two giant cigars emitting a strange blue hue like a florescent light. The only way I can access the speed would be to say that there were Passenger planes flying in as well, I would have to assume towards the Fort Lauderdale airport, and it took the planes approximately 15 seconds to reach the point that I had seen the objects pass by. This was definitely not light from any other source as the objects which passed were self contained and finite and not as light emitting from somewhere else. The objects were also flying well above the passenger planes.;26.2641090753424;-80.1961282534248
