Saw something that looked like a billiard rack silently moving south to north.;1981-03-25 19:30:00;30 sec;Saw something that looked like a billiard rack silently moving south to north. It was't very dark, the city lights were reflecting off the low rolling clouds. I went outside the house by the pool. I looked up and saw what I thought was a 2-sided triangle of birds flying in formation beneath the clouds. The only thing is, upon closer examination, the thing had three sides and for the life of me I could not see individual birds flying. It looked to me like one of those racks you use for playing billiards. It was silent, moving south to north. I asked my girlfriend to look at it, she didn't know what to make of it. It had no lights. I tried to calculate its size by comparing it to the distance to the bottom of the low rolling clouds. The reason I say rolling is that I could see the bottom of the clouds in detail, they were moving pretty fast. It was kind of windy that night. I've heard a lot of reports of triangles flying in the air, but never one like what I saw. I thought perhaps if you add this to your database, someone else may have seen something similar.

Front nose with brig;1998-05-08 21:40:00;15 min.;At night looked like rocket with bright tail launched 200 miles north near NASA but in 7 minutes it was above us.  Front nose with bright light, twin flaming tail lights, no noise, very large size, no strobes or colors. Hovering past no visable body only 3 lights to judge size.  Went slow into night sky. After gone, 2 white lights (jets?) came from over ocean to catch up with it then all disappeared. ((Deleted))@aol.com;26.2641090753424;-80.1961282534248
Pompano/Ft .Lauderdale Beach Triangle craft disappears!;2004-05-07 15:35:00;6-8 minutes;Pompano/Ft .Lauderdale Beach Triangle craft disappears! While on Pompano beach we watched a black triangle shaped object moving at high altitude,First thought it was a large military craft but the closer it came it was apparent that it was huge in size and dwarfed commercial liners flying into Lauderdale/miami of which I might add had been regular inbounds but after this there were none for at least a hour and we were in the flight path area.Back to the craft,we could see the com trail over the Atlantic to out of oursight by eye or to the horizon,comtrail was huge circles, the craft approaching land went into a partial cloud cover but you could see through the cloud and no other clouds were in the area at the time.We watched to see it come out,it didnt it disappeared we waited and looked around in other directions, nothing.Comtrail stopped short of land and the cragt was gone just gone.The comtrail stayed for 30 to 45 min.I dont know what this was, none of us did we didnt have any cameras or video but more than just us saw it as this is mothers day weekend and many were there early like us.No alcohol or anything like that this was a real sighting of something capable of more than what we have and huge,to give some idea of the size I would say 10-15 commercial jets set side by side would not have covered it,altitude has to be a guess here,commercial jets landing we were looking at it from the beach Im going to say 35000ft.What was it,dont know,where did it go,vanished.This is true Id like some kind of explanation what we saw,I dont want to see it again though.No Sound;26.2641090753424;-80.1961282534248
Coroful sharp lights above Pompano Beach.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a twinkling star, we suspect.  PD));2009-05-05 22:00:00;3 hours;Coroful sharp lights above Pompano Beach From the 10th floor of our condo, looking 260 degrees West from A1A & 14th Street.  2 of us observed stationary colorful lights that appeared to be appx 4,000 feet above the regular airline traffic patterns.  We had 8x Nikon binoculars for closer look, but was visable with naked eye. The lights were every color of the rainbow and very sharp and clear.  They had a crisp laser like look to them.  The goodyear blimp is based near there and I see it fly regulary.  It never flies to the altitudes we saw and the regular airline trafic was clearly below this thing.

Black triangular object dancing around in the night sky.;2013-11-25 19:11:00;15 minutes;Black triangular object dancing around in the night sky. One black triangular shaped flat object in the sky with periodic double red lights.  The object/craft seemed to move as a plastic bag in the wind dancing around in the sky.   Attempted to record video on my phone of the object but my phone could not pick up the object for some reason.  It is a very dark, cloudy and stormy night so I watch the objects for about 10 to 15 minutes until it started raining at which point I got into my car.;26.2641090753424;-80.1961282534248
An unexpected triangular object with light flames surrounding it appeared near my balcony in Florida before heading out to sea.;2021-04-20 06:20:00;15 seconds;An unexpected triangular object with light flames surrounding it appeared near my balcony in Florida before heading out to sea. The object was a large steel colored triangle with circles at the very tips of the two corners. There was a line down each side appearing engraved.  There was glaring bright light flames coming from around it almost blinding.  I was sitting on my ninth floor balcony on the ocean when it approached. After about seven seconds or so it left and went across the ocean having one blinking red light behind it.  The glaring bright lights were no longer on. I watched until it was out of sight moments later. It appeared to either go into the ocean or just disappeared. I questioned a few residents at the pool the morning to see if anyone else saw it but nobody did.  I informed friends and family up north via text and telephone communication.  I drafted an informal drawing of what I saw even though I’ll never forget it.  I’m a seasonal resident in Florida and a Rhode Island resident.  I’m 69 years old and a practicing attorney in Massachusetts.;26.2641090753424;-80.1961282534248
