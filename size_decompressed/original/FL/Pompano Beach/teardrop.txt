Upside down, tear drop shaped UFO in S Florida;2003-05-05 01:00:00;10 minutes;Upside down, tear drop shaped UFO in S Florida I'm not sure of the date, but somewhere around 2003. I'm sending this in because I saw the report that was submitted  July 13 2005 and it was a bit similar to what I saw. This was late night around 1 am, my neighbor, girlfriend and my self saw the object for about 10 minutes. It was off in the distance, I'd guess several miles. It appeared like a upside down teardrop and I remember a blue glow at the top and it faded to a white glow toward the bottom. It was very bright, like the light of a jet flying toward you and was about 10x the size of a jet's front light. It appeared to have either flashing lights around the middle or a series of lights sort of circling the middle. It hovered motionless for a minute or so and also made long, slow arcs or half circles like a broad smile. After what seemed like 10 minutes it slowly moved off towards the NE, which would put it moving out to sea. As it started to move off, it's view was obstructed by tree's that were close to us. It wasn't very high in the sky either. Maybe about as high as you would see helicopters. I called the police and they said they had received several calls and that 30 minutes earlier the same object had been sighted over Margate which would have been SW of our location. The also took my personal information and asked if it was okay for someone from somewhere I don't recall where, to contact me. I never heard anything more.
