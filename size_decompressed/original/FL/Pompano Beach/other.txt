Rotating colored lights over Pompano Beach Florida in the summer of 1970;1970-08-01 20:00:00;app 2 min;Rotating colored lights over Pompano Beach Florida in the summer of 1970 I was standing outside of our apartment in pompano beach florida around dusk. It was almost completely dark.  I was with my motherand our neighbor next door.  I had just turned 15 on july 14th.   As my mother and our neighbor were talking I looked up to the northwest and saw lights coming towards us. It was completely round and the lights appear to be rotating around the rim.  The object resembled almost a child's top, the type you push the handle up and down and it makes the top spin.  It passed directly over our heads and was completely silent and there was no wind or any disturbance of the air.  I pointed up at the object and my neighbors and also my mother turned and looked at it and my neighbor turned and said that is a dirigible.  It went from northwest to south east over the top of our apartment complex on seventh avenue and dixie highway in pompano beach florida.  My neighbor insisted that it was a dirigible it was nothing unusual.  On myself only be 15 had never seen 1 before and I assumed he was correct.  After all this time of reading about ufo's I do not believe it was a dirigible but instead something else.  I have never seen it since and never saw anything like that prior to that night.

Red and blue light cluster moved east across sky then stop and hover. After a few minutes, lights move west until I lost sight.;2014-04-24 22:30:00;5-10 minutes;Red and blue light cluster moved east across sky then stop and hover. After a few minutes, lights move west until I lost sight. I was outside at night with my mother bringing things into the house.  I look up and see a cluster of bright lights moving east.  One red with multiple blue lights on one side like wings.  The blue lights formed a sort of semi circle. At first I thought it was a plane but the lights were too bright and it was too high up to be a helicopter.  I didn't hear any noise coming from it. Then it stopped flying and just hovered in place for a few minutes.  At this point my mom was looking at it too. Once it started moving west my mother told me to be careful and she started moving indoors. I stayed keeping an eye on it as it moved west. At one point, I lose it behind some trees but managed to walk around and see it hovering by the horizon.  I stare for a few minutes until it again begins flying west and I lose sight of it.  This is the first time I see something like this.;26.2641090753424;-80.1961282534248

I was in a state of shock, and I took my cell phone camera to take a video picture, but I wasn't able to take a picture of the UFO.   The UFO was traveling northwest.  Object did not make any sound it was very silent. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere, and serious-minded.

The grounds encompass ±1,000 acres and include a public airport (PMP), Goodyear Blimp operations center, horse stables, outdoor shopping mall, municipal golf course and dog park.  My vehicle was parked in the public parking lot located at the southeast corner of the property, approximately 25-feet from a chain link fence that denotes the border of the airport grounds. I frequently park in that lot and have become accustomed to seeing aircraft take off from runways 28 and 33. The confluence of the runways is ±1,000-feet west of the fence line at that location. Airplanes that take off from runway 28 fly directly over the parking lot at a very low altitude.  The weather was clear and visibility was excellent. I had my (prescription) sunglasses on and was monitoring some thunderclouds that were forming off in the distance, to the west/northwest.  I was sitting on the tailgate of my truck, facing the airport. I’d just removed my shoes and was looking down at my feet when I heard an airplane making its way down the runway. I looked up to see a small prop plane that had just taken off from runway 33. It was headed south/southeast, moving right to left, and was ±50-feet off the ground when I focused in on it.  Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed an object at a higher altitude that was moving left to right, in the opposite direction of (i.e. towards) the airplane. From my vantage point, the object appeared to pass directly over the airplane. I thought to myself “the pilot must have seen that.”  Because the object was much smaller than the airplane, I assumed that it was a helium filled party balloon. I looked away and thought how dangerous it was for something like that to be floating in the airspace of the airport.  Immediately, something didn’t sit right with me. I looked back, relocated and started tracking the object. I watched it very closely for ±5 seconds until it was out of my view. It definitely wasn’t an airplane, helicopter, balloon or any kind of drone that I’ve ever seen. I don’t know what it was.  It stuck out like a sore thumb, thanks in part to the contrast provided by the backdrop of the thunderclouds that were forming in the distance, but more so in the way that it moved. It moved effortlessly and never varied in speed or altitude. It was as if the object was gliding on an invisible track or rail. Most curiously, it seemed to be tumbling, every which way. Nonetheless, its trajectory was in a perfectly straight line and it was moving much faster than the plane. It was surreal.  The shape of the object has proven difficult to describe. It had no discernible points, edges or sharp angels. Rather, everything was rounded and smooth. It was slightly oblong, kind of like if you squished a football from end to end.  - It was the size of a large trash can or 55-gallon drum - It was flying at an altitude 2 to 3 times higher than the airplane - It was moving 3 to 4 times faster than the airplane - It was solid black and not reflective - It didn’t have any windows, doors, seams or markings - It didn’t have any lights or make any sound - It didn’t have any props or rotors.  Although there were other cars in the parking lot, no one else was around. Presumably, they were out on the trail. There may have been people on the golf course who saw it, as it flew right over it and out of my view.  I pulled out of the parking lot at ±7:15 PM.;26.2641090753424;-80.1961282534248
