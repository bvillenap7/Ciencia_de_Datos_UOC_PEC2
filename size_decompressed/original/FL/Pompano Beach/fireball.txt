Fireball.   ((NUFORC Note:  Report from pilot.  PD));2012-12-27 22:20:00;5 minutes;Fireball moving from northeast to southwest.  This is the second time we've seen this. We reported the same thing about a week ago.  I have a picture from my iPhone from the original event and about 5 pictures from this one that just occurred. Again, no sound whatsoever.  This time we saw the clouds behind it and I estimate (I'm a pilot) that this was maybe 4000 to 6000 ft. This time we got a better view and it almost looked like there was a parachute shadow behind it but the rate of travel seemed to be more than 200 knots based on my altitude estimate.. This was not a flare. Not a shooting star . Not a high altitude UFO. This is something we've never seen until last week or so.  Now we saw it again, this is interesting.  What the heck is going on?;26.2641090753424;-80.1961282534248
Green Fireball spotted over Pompano Beach in the Morning.;2016-08-19 06:30:00;Few seconds;Green Fireball spotted over Pompano Beach in the Morning. I was opening the garage door at work & spotted a light in the sky that grew in intensity. I've seen shooting stars many times before, so I thought that it would be one. However, it took off really quick & the orb was glowing green, while the tail & the sky around it flashed through different colors rapidly.  Not to mention that it was MUCH bigger than a shooting star.  It was almost similar to a flare being shot off, but it was green (not red), flew in a fast & straight line, and it had a bunch of colors streaming from it. There is a video online of a Green Fireball flying over Poland.  That is very similar to what I saw in almost every detail (even how the head detached from the tail) except for the one I saw had the tail that kept changing colors. I wasn't going to report this, but I saw that there were other reports of a (the?) fireball flying around that same day. I want to include that in 1999, me & my girlfriend witnessed a triangle UFO hovering very close to where we were standing in a parking lot.  DAYS after that spotting, I noticed a strange triangle pattern tattooed into my hand that matched right up to other triangle tattoos that I've seen on other UFO witnesses.  I'm saying all this because I HAVE NOT YET looked over my body this time, but I will in order to see if there is anything abnormal.;26.2641090753424;-80.1961282534248
