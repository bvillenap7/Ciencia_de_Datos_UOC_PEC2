Bright orange Sphere goes over Pompano Beach, Florida in seconds!;1997-11-15 23:30:00;2 minutes;Bright orange Sphere goes over Pompano Beach, Florida in seconds! I was walking my dog along the beach.  I saw a round, orange, ball coming off the ocean, moving east to west, towards me.  It flew over me, traveled south towards Fort Lauderdale, and after about 3/4 mile, it headed southeast, back over the ocean, but along the coastline.  It took off so fast, literally within 1-2 SECONDS it was out of sight.  It made no sound at all.  Nice orange glow to it, as far as color.  I didn't believe in UFO's before that night.  Sorry this is so late, I just got a computer 3 weeks ago.  I heard you on Art Bell once.  Coming back with him too?  I hope so, thank you.;26.2641090753424;-80.1961282534248

Orange reddish sphere over North Ft. Lauderdale. ((anonymous report))((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Canaveral?  PD));2017-03-18 20:35:00;15;Orange Reddish Sphere over North Ft. Lauderdale. Was out to see the rocket launch since it was such a clear night.  Instead I see a orange reddish sphere traveling south.   As soon as I saw it, I knew it wasn't an aircraft since an aircraft would have flashing anti-collision lights on the edges.   I rushed to call my family inside, but by the time we came outside the light was gone.   Other aircraft were flying around this time, too.
