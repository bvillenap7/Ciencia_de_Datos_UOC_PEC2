Small light similar to a star flashed twice and appeared to move in an erratic pattern.;2004-07-10 22:00:00;15 Minutes;Small light similar to a star flashed twice and appeared to move in an erratic pattern. I was standing on the beach with my partner eating ice cream that we had just purchased from a shop 1/2 block from the sand.  I first noticed a dot of light in the eastern sky about 45 degress above the ocean.  It looked like a star but began to slowly move further east, I then thought it was an airplane and pointed out to my witness.  We both agreed that it was to high and distant to be a plane, no sooner dio=d we boith focus on the light and it flashed.  The flash was triple the original lights size and lasted just a milli second.  We continued to watch the light and it seemed to dance around and flashed again one more time.  At a much lower altitude about 20 degress in the same eastern sky we observed airplanes on their approach to the Miami and Ft. Lauderdale airports.  Comparing the two, it was evident that the first light we saw just a few minutes prior was not a plane.  We continued to watch the small dot of light and observed anotherlight, similar to a star moving from the north towards the first light, my first assumption was it was an airplane.  I was wrong because the light moved behind an area of clouds and never re-emerged.;26.2641090753424;-80.1961282534248
Flashing Lights Around A Very Bright Moon;2005-04-11 22:00:00;15 Mins +;Flashing Lights Around A Very Bright Moon Perfectly clear night here in South Florida. The moon was fully illuminated with a very bright crescent at the bottom  http://www.stardate.org/nightsky/moon/  The sun light that was hitting the moon allowed me to see the entire moons shape.  The moon was low on the northwest horizon, about 30 degrees. On the north side of the moon I could see 4-5 very faint lights that appeared to flash, move erratically and change color. My vision is excellent and I'm not sure if this is an atmospheric phenomenon or what?  I would guess anyone staring at the moon tonight would easily see what I saw.  Is it distant stars that appear to flash due to the upper level winds and clouds?;26.2641090753424;-80.1961282534248

Neon purple/blue light hovering over neighborhood in Crystal Lake, FL.;2014-04-10 09:30:00;10 minutes;Neon purple/blue light hovering over neighborhood in Crystal Lake, FL. I was entering my neighborhood when I spotted a neon blue and purple light.  It mostly hovered, occasionally moving up and down, then side to side.   After ten minutes it flew straight to the left, then seemed to lower out of sight.  It disappeared for about 5 minutes then shot out straight up.  I waited, but it never reappeared.   While the ufo was visible their were about 3 to 4 airplanes in the same vicinity.  1 of the airplanes seemed to be very close to it.   I managed a couple pictures, but they ended up blurring, although you can distinctly see the colors of the ufo.  Several of my neighbors watched the spacecraft from outside their homes.  After all of the excitement was over I pulled into my driveway.   As i exited my vehicle a car pulled over and honked.  Thinking it was my room mate i waved, it was not.  A man rolled down the window and asked me if i believed in jesus christ.   Confused i did not answer.  He repeated Do you believe in Jesus Christ?  I could tell he was getting agitated so i said yes.  He stared at me for a moment and then drove away.  I could not see his face, but i do not believe he was an entity, maybe just a man scared about what he had just seen.  This is the 2nd time in 5 days that our neighborhood has seen strange things in the sky.;26.2641090753424;-80.1961282534248
