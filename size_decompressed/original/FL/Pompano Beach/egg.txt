Hi- on or about the date in July, I was awoken at 4:11am.  I was troubled by waking up so abruptly due to a dream or some kind of feeling.  I turned off the home alarm, went outside.   I was facing East which is toward the Atlantic Ocean, there was a large golden sideways egg shape glowing as if it was a gigantic full moon raising.  It is not possible for the moon to be in the sky raising at 4:00 am on the east coast or am I incorrectly considering this as an explanation?  I watched it, it stayed in the same spot, then went behind a few large tropical clouds, the golden glow stayed. I just starred.  I am not sure what else happened other than I though I was losing my mind that the planets seemed to be in the wrong place.  It was still in the dark early morning sky when I went back in the house.
