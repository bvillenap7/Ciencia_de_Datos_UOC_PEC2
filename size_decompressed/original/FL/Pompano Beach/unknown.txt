we were visited and possible abducted last night.;2001-02-12 02:30:00;unknown;we were visited and possible abducted last night. the whole family woke up strangely within minutes of each other. my nightgown was on backwards and it was like i had floated out of a dream upon waking. my body immediatley began shaking and i jumped from bed to check my sons and husband. when i walked into rooms they were all asleep. huh. i returned to mine to have them appear in front of me one by one. one complaining of headache anopther ear ache. we stayed up for at least an hour and went to sleep to the sounds of some sort of motor noise buzzing loudly. i heard this very loud but klids say it was faint.my husband had seen lights in sons bedroom and thought they were up playing video games. have seen strange helicopters in the area but have so many planes and such in the area it is hard to know where they come from. have been visited all my life by the unknown and children tell of their encounters. if anything has been reported in the pompano beach area lately it would be interesting to know.;26.2641090753424;-80.1961282534248
Possible UFO sighting it could've been the police helicopter flying zig-zagging, high in the air, strange.;2008-05-24 23:30:00;10 MIN max;Possible UFO sighting it could've been the police helicopter flying zig-zagging, high in the air, strange. I just saw I think a UFO, and it had flashing lights, it went in a zig zagging formation, sort of a square I guess a few times too, then kept going, but it wasn't moving fast.  I just looked out my window and saw a buncha cop cars, un-marked and marked, it looked like they just served a warrant, it could've been the police helicopter but then again, never seen the police helicopter with a light formation of that sort, and I've seen my police helicopter a lot, I wouldn't lie about this too. This is the best info I can give you..;26.2641090753424;-80.1961282534248

Female HR Manager Male Military....possibly 3 or 4 different objects 1 large grey rectangle shape...2nd much smaller and all we could see was a bright star shape.  This one kept going around the others very quickly...another one with a white tower in the middle.  One time this object was by itself then another the small star like object right next to it.  The other we just don't know.  They all stayed in the same vicinity for more than an hour.;26.2641090753424;-80.1961282534248
