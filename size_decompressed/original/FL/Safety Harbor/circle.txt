Small light disc circling ball of light flies by.  Not a vessel.;2014-08-08 00:45:00;00:00:05;Small light disc circling ball of light flies by.  Not a vessel. I was in my friend’s neighborhood last night around 12:45am (00:45).  He lives in a neighborhood with duplexes, and a public pool.  We were sitting in the pool deck area on pool chairs talking about politics, life, obscure theories, etc.  He was facing me, and just over his shoulder up in the sky, a small glowing disc quickly flew by.  I’ve never had a ufo experience before, and I don’t read up on them much, so I’ll use my limited knowledge to make a description:   This didn’t look like your typical Hollywood UFO.  It was a very small disk in the sky.  At first, I immediately thought it might have been a shooting star, but it was too large, and not out in space.  I’ve seen shooting stars before and they are quick and faint, this was prominent, a little slower, and close. I want to say it was less than 100ft off the ground, it seemed like it just went over the tree tops. What made me confused is that it was VERY small.  Up in the sky it was relative to the size of a Frisbee, and when I described it to my friend, I said it looked like half of the size of the moon in the sky.  So based on its altitude, I’d say it was probly 1/3 the size of a family sedan in reality (it could probably fit in the trunk of a car)   Physical Appearance:  It was FLAT.  It wasn’t a large machine, flying craft, plane, or anything. It was like a flat disk with a faint ball of light in the middle, and then a bright ring surrounding the ball. The space between the ball and the ring were EMPTY.  It was just a ring of light circling a ball of light. Another note:  There was NO noise.  There were no engine sounds from a helicopter or airplane.  It was a quiet breeze.  The only sounds that night were my friend and I talking, and the ambient noise of crickets and air.  It passed without a noise. It quickly flew by in a couple of seconds and disappeared over the tree tops. At first I thought shooting star, and then I thought it looked like a HUGE firefly.  That’s my best comparison to the light it was giving off. The light was not sharp, it was very glow-ie, and gave off a sphere of ambient light from the two light sources that made a sort of sphere around it.  It was a very faint light. Again, it was only a light. It didn’t look like it was a vessel meant to transport anything, and was certainly not large enough for an average man to fit in. I would describe the light's color as a clean white glow.;28.0083999999999;-82.6950999999989
