I watch the skies regularly for any UFO activity, and usually I am never let down. I figured that by going to the pier, with wide open skies, I would have even better luck for such viewings. When I left my neighborhood, there were already two mini-golden balls of light hovering in the sky. This is pretty normal for me, so I continued on towards the pier. At the pier, I was completely astonished. There were three of the golden balls of light, now. And each time I would look at them directly or held my camera lens up to them, they would move sideways, not blinking. After I began filming them, another light would appear next to the golden ball. This light began to flash and I watched through my camera as it went from golden light, to what looked like some sort of mock-aircraft. This was no aircraft. These balls of light hover for 15, sometimes 30 minutes, until they are found out and that is when they start moving. Not only that, but other types of UFOs were up in the atmosphere as well. All of them silent. No noise. There are two airports that you can see from the pier. Clearwater/St Pete airport and Tampa International .NONE of these crafts went to either. Most of them blinked irregularly while I filmed them, and I watched as they grew fainter, until I was unable to see them anymore. There are certain regulations when it comes to navigational lights on a plane. I have studied this and I barely saw any planes that night. Everything was silent save for the people on the dock fishing who were completely and utterly oblivious to the whole thing. These are not planes. I know planes have headlights and I know what they look like when they are close-- these were not planes. When I went back to my house to charge my camera(It died while filming. I only need a DV cable to upload the video.)  I saw another one hovering around the trees.  I went back to the pier an hour later and there was nothing in the sky.  NOTHING. I sat there for 15 minutes and nothing happened. They were all gone.;28.0083999999999;-82.6950999999989
Extremely bright white rectangle in the northern sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2020-03-21 21:00:00;2 hours;Extremely bright white rectangle in the northern sky Last night I saw an extremely bright light in the sky around 9:00pm eastern.  I've never seen it before.  It was almost rectangle shape and much closer than a star.  I continued to watch over the course of a couple of hours as it moved north.  It was slow moving, but visibly moved over the course of the 2 hours.  As it moved further away it became more circular.  Have several photos and videos as well as a second witness.;28.0083999999999;-82.6950999999989
My boyfriend went to take out the trash and said he called me to come outside because he said he saw something in the sky. I wanted to;2020-03-24 21:30:00;20 minutes;My boyfriend went to take out the trash and said he called me to come outside because he said he saw something in the sky. I wanted to come take a look... Not sure what exactly he saw, but while sky watching a light appeared out of no where. If you were facing Venus (west) The light appeared underneath it to the left. The light looked like it could be a star or even a satelite if you have ever seen one moving. But it definitely wasn't. The movement was not like a satellite, where as a satellite would move slow and in pre programmed line, already knowing the direction. This light was slow, but not like a satellite. This was faster and was moving up then to the left ( south/south east ) moving with an intelligence, not just drifting or shooting through the air. It then disappeared in thin air, faded away. No cloud cover either.The same thing happened again about 10 minutes later, but was moving to the right. If you were looking at Venus, facing west, the next ! one appeared out of no where underneath Venus to the left again, and made it's way to the right ( north ) the tunred and went more diagonally up, then dissolved.
