In the sky was a bullet/pill shaped, metallic/chrome colored object larger than a plane or helicopter with no wings or blades. It hovered very high in the sky, then came close enough to Earth see the sunâ€™s reflection on it, then turned on its axis, and flew incredibly fast backwards (without turning from it's position), where it hovered again.  Then another bullet/pill shaped, metallic/chrome colored object appeared literally out of thin air, and hovered with the other for a couple of minutes.  Both objects started flying in the same direction, towards a field one stopped again and hovered in the same spot for several minutes, while the other disappeared back into thin air.  There was no sound from either object.  There was a definitive vertical line down the center of each object. We, the observers, are both in institutions of higher education, and possess sound and rational mental states.  These objects were beyond logic, both in how the looked and how they be! haved.
