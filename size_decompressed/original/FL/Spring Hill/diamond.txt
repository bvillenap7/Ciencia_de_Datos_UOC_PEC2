Strange Lights in the sky over Pasco County, Florida;2010-07-10 23:55:00;15 minutes;Strange Lights in the sky over Pasco County, Florida On July 10, 2010, while at B-day party for my step-daughterâ€™s 21st b-day myself and approximately 30 other individuals witnessed an unusual event.    While we were lighting off fireworks someone in the group noticed some strange lights floating through the sky.  It was approximately 11:55 PM and the weather conditions were mild despite the humidity.   We had been launching fire works for about 10 minutes when the lights in the sky were noticed.  My wife, who is a paranormal investigator,  was filming the fireworks when she turned the camera and caught  phenomenon on video.   The lights were all flying in a straight line although at what I would assume different altitudes and all extinguished at the same location in the sky.  I was able to get a count of the first group, which was 17.   Almost exactly 5 minutes later another group of 9 lights came from the same area and extinguished in the same location once again.  There was no sound from the objects just the light.;28.46588396072;-82.5455320785597

Five objects appeard in the northern sky and proceeded south west.   At first, I thought it was an airplane on fire.  Then I saw another and then 2 more and finally a fifth one.  The color was red with maybe some yellow aound the edges?   They moved overhead and then south west and out of sight.   They seemed to be lower than an aircraft but still very high.
