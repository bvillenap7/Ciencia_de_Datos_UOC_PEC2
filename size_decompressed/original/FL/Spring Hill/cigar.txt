ufo over springhill florida;2008-12-27 20:15:00;seconds;ufo over springhill florida i was looking up at the orion system.  above the sqare portion of the star formation, about what appears to be a distance of twenty feet from the ground, a star that appears to be orange in color.  as if it where going dim.  i noticed a high flying jet with an evident strobe about maybe 30.000 ft.  when all of a sudden, for a brief moment i observed a cigar shaped craft out of the corner of my right eye, following it to full vision, then it was gone.  it was luminous white, emitting a white trail.  it then vanished as if being cloaked suddenly.  this object was far closer to earth than the aircraft at 30.000.  it was not a shooting star.  if i were looking to the right, or southeast alittle more, i would have seen it for a longer duration.  there was no apparent ark to its trajectory.;28.46588396072;-82.5455320785597
