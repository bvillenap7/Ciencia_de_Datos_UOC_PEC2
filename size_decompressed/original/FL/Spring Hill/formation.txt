3 or 4 faint light formation traveling south to south east in perfect formation across sky.;2010-10-06 21:07:00;2 to 3 seconds;3 or 4 faint light formation traveling south to south east in perfect formation across sky. I saw 3 possibly 4 faint lights traveling south to south east rapidly. They just faded away.  All lights were a faint white and did not block out any stars within the triangle shape.  I was just wondering if anyone else might have seen this.;28.46588396072;-82.5455320785597
Witness to FLEET of UFO's over Spring Hill Florida.;2014-11-08 22:15:00;5 minutes;Witness to FLEET of UFO's over Spring Hill Florida. On November 8th, at approximately 10:15 pm in Spring Hill Florida, on a clear weather night, I was outside to check the wires for the cable company because we had lost net and phone at 10pm est so we called them from our cell phone.  When I looked into the sky I saw a FLEET of unusual objects traveling southwest at about  four thousand feet high and close to 50 or 60 of them.  There was no sound coming from them they also had no exhaust or tail to speak of.  They moved at a medium speed across the sky.They was a redish yellow color. They was lined up in a row but not a perfect row at first two rows that became one row.  They did not loose altitude nor gain a big amount of altitude as if your looking at a plane traveling, but these was not any aircraft!  They stayed the course of southwest with difference in space between them. The strings of objects lasted about 5 minutes.  The length of string of objects would be approximately  2-4 miles from first object to last. Two strings one on top of the other was the first mile worth of the objects, again not in a perfect formation.;28.46588396072;-82.5455320785597
