Isosceles shape, large craft hovers over Spring Hill;2002-05-30 23:00:00;5 min;Isosceles shape, large craft hovers over Spring Hill Laying watching the sky, we saw an isosceles shape formed by lights.  As it moved across the sky the stars disappeared yet when the stars reached the middle they reappeared, giving the suspicion of it being a formation of three crafts together.  It may have well been just one craft with some sort of missing center.  Also, there were airplanes around it, or in its vicinity.  It suddenly stopped and then vanished.

Strange lights in the sky over Spring Hill. Triangular in shape no sound;2002-06-03 22:00:00;6 min;Strange lights in the sky over Spring Hill. Triangular in shape no sound I was driving my truck to the southern portion of my ranch to check for any open gates when I saw a faint light thru the trees. As I approached a clearing I could see a faint outline with about 6 small lights underneath. It hovered for about 3 minutes and then slowly headed north and out of sight. I am a former Air Force avionics tesc and have seen some of the strangest looking flight formations but this thing didn't make any noise whatsoever;28.46588396072;-82.5455320785597
High Triangular Object?;2014-06-19 21:15:00;2 minutes;High Triangular Object? A few minutes past nine in the evening I was in the yard and noticed, to the west-northwest (over the Gulf of Mexico) several thunderheads.   Behind them there was still some light and the sky was not quite dark, though nearly so.  One only of these thunderheads, at about 340 degrees, was lit with a particularly brilliant sequence of lightning bolts, coming repeatedly every few seconds.   As I watched it, I saw a plane (with its anticollision lights blinking) pass below between the thunderclouds and myself.  And then, high up, seemingly at or a little above the tops of the thunderheads,  I saw a white light moving towards the northeast.  I thought it might be a satellite or very high jet, but then the single light resolved into three separate white lights, in a tight triangular formation.   The object then slowed, reversed direction, then slowed, proceeded northeast again and went behind another high cloud.  I waited for it to reappear on the far side of the cloud, bu! t it never did so.   The object(s) must have been at a very high altitude, and it occurred to me that to see the three lights distinctly separate at such height must indicate large size.;28.46588396072;-82.5455320785597
