Fireball in sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a sighting of Venus.  PD));2016-12-30 21:40:00;>2 minutes;Fireball in sky. As my husband was driving down Mariner Blvd.  I in the passenger seat noticed a cylinder very bright fireball object in the sky.  It looked as if it was falling but never fell just kind of stood in place maybe.   I came home to check news reports, because I was for sure it was a plane.  Nothing is being reported as of yet.   Found this sight in the process of my search on what was going on.  My daughter tried to get pics but it was too far away for a phone camera.  It was like a falling explosion in the sky but never fell. ((NUFORC Note:  We have changed the time above, to reflect a nighttime sighting.  Possible sighting of Venus.
