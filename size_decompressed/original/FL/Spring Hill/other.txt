V shaped object appears almost cloaked in the night sky headed south along U.S. 19;2010-10-06 20:56:00;25 seconds;V shaped object appears almost cloaked in the night sky headed south along U.S. 19 My husband and I were taking a walk around our complex and saw a strange object in the sky. The object appeared to be the shape of a boomer rang or a v shape.  It had very faint lights or it possibly reflection of parking lot lights off of it's exterior. It was rather low and very large. It appeared to be a grey color almost in the night sky.  There was absolutly no sound coming from the object even though it appeared to be very low in the sky.  There was some sort of haze or fog that appeared around it maybe... I think that is why it sort of looked like it was blocking the lights out almost. This happened at about aprox. 20:56 Eastern Standard Time. The object flew south towards Tampa from Spring Hill, FL. or South along U.S. 19.;28.46588396072;-82.5455320785597
Wide white streak.;2012-09-29 01:11:00;ongoing;Not a shape.  Just a wide white streak, not like a plane, going from south to north across the sky.   It would look like the milky way but no stars, just a wide streak.;28.46588396072;-82.5455320785597

Two objects in noon-day sky -- one larger with a white and an orange light, one smaller with no lights;2019-02-17 11:30:00;10 minutes;Two objects in noon-day sky -- one larger with a white and an orange light, one smaller with no lights My wife and I saw two objects in the sky about 11:30am Sunday 2/17/19.  We were sitting in our car near MacDonalds on Highway 50 in Spring Hill, FL (in the large shopping center).   We were looking north.  There was one object with different colored lights, one white, one a bright orange -- the orange light was so bright that we could not determine the object's shape.   There was another smaller cylindrical separate object without lights.  It moved around and then disappeared.  The first bigger object at the first was moving toward us and then started moving away from us and then it completely disappeared.   We watched this activity for about 10 minutes.   The objects seemed to be fairly high up in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));28.46588396072;-82.5455320785597
star moving across the east sky.  Then another.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-02-15 05:30:00;10 minutes;I was having my usual morning coffee in my front window looking off to the east waiting for sunrise.  The stars were bright and beautiful the sky crystal clear.  I noticed an object that looked like a closer brighter star moving across the east sky,  Then another in the same flight path moving to the east.  My first thought was high flying jets but after seeing the same thing over and over again to the count of 10 I decided to go out and see where they were coming from.  Not out of the west but seemed to be coming straight in from the darkness of space looking like a faint star and the with warp speed coming into vision to the size of a larger star, slowing down and traveling to the east at slower warp speed.  This continued for 2-3 min.  I ran in woke my spouse up to witness.  We stood the for another 5 - 8 min watching one after the other coming in and disappearing  to the horizon in the east.  So glad I had a witness.  Never have seen anything like it.;28.46588396072;-82.5455320785597
