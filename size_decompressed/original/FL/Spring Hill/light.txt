Unidentified object in Florida.;2002-10-06 23:30:00;2- min;Unidentified object in Florida. Well I was out in front of my house putting up the top to my convertible, when I heard a very low gargle sound... I looked in to the sky, and saw a plane in the NE sky, But what was strange, when you see a plane in the sky, your hear the engines after the plane begins to pass over, but I heard it before, so I asumed that there was something else. I looks to the West, and saw a Light about 100 feet over the tree line. It was moving very slow.  I was watching for a few seconds, when the gargle sound started getting very loud, and the light accelarated towards the the N.W. It picked up speed, and was out of sight in seconds...;28.46588396072;-82.5455320785597
2 points of light seen from a small telescope;2006-05-20 22:10:00;5 minutes;2 points of light seen from a small telescope While observing with a small, wide field telescope I spotted what I thought was space debree. I at first saw one pinpoint of light traveling north to south, as it passed across the eyepiece i then noticed a second point of light. These lights moved together. I do not know the distance beween them but can only say I used a wide angle eyepieces, of 60 degress. These 2 objects fit with in 50 degrees of this eyepiece, just enough to track them both in the same field of view. These objects did appear to move as one unit the entire time i watched them  I have sme figures that may help in identifying them  The scope used was a 4 and 1/2 inch f4 wide field scope. eyepiece used was also widefield 60 degrees. 20mm. Which would put it at 20x magnification.  I did not have setting circles so I do not know the elevation. But, these objects did pass by M13 which is in hercules. they were within a degree of it from my location.  The amount of sky covered within this viewing was from anywhere north. And I lost track around scorpio as my scope is in a cradle mount and was hitting the back of the chair that I had it on.  the entire time I view I guessing is 5 minutes.  i did see a plane or jet pass in front of my scope as viewing ese objects also. It was in front of them. So they deffinitly were further out. These lights never blinked they stayed steadily lit. No flickering and no other lights emmiting from either of them.  they moved so perfecgtly ogether that it did seem as one object, I didnt see anything between them that would suggest this.  Thankyou;28.46588396072;-82.5455320785597

Ominous sun like light, not projecting, like burning within a craft of some sort.;2013-06-07 22:00:00;15:00 min;Ominous sun like light, not projecting, like burning within a craft of some sort. About week ago at night [10pm] while walking 'Chester' I saw a UFO and I was quite amazed that I could not explain what had happened.   Well last night there was four of these objects flying over our house so I ran back and got mom to take pictures. We did not get photos to turn out.  By the way while we were standing there looking at them one by one they turned and climbed out of vision within seconds. The first incident was lower and somewhat frightening in that the light from it looked like a small sun with changing values {brightness} as in searching the sky and moved from east to northwest in an arc overhead lower then planes [30,000] but had no sound at all.;28.46588396072;-82.5455320785597
Bright light with several changing colors over the Gulf of Mexico.;2014-03-19 02:00:00;10+;Bright light with several changing colors over the Gulf of Mexico. I went outside to smoke a cigarette in the back yard that is west facing.  It was a clear night with a bright full or close to full moon.   I saw a bright light in the west which appeared to be at a high altitude.  This light was much brighter than every other light in the sky other than then the moon.  It appeared to be over the gulf of Mexico.   The light had several different colors to it.  It appeared to have smaller red lights in the center on the top and bottom and it looked like the light between the red lights changed colors (white, blue, orange).   It could have been a planet but or bright star, but I went out at the same time on the 20th and there was no light in that area.   I go outside and often look at the stars and track satellites and do not recall seeing a light this bright in that location of the sky.

Strands of lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-11-22 05:58:00;3 minutes;Witnessed several strands of lights seemingly being pulled by a double lite object. I counted at least 12 lights and then the pattern began again.  Some only had a shorter strand with last two closer than others.  This went on for at least 3mns much higher than the airplanes that were taking off from the Brooksville airport.  Appeared to be going south to north east.;28.46588396072;-82.5455320785597

The light was as bright as Venus and quickly got brighter.  Shortly after noticing, it dimmed a little and quickly turned East and vanished between stars in a diamond shape.  There were no traces left behind.;28.46588396072;-82.5455320785597
