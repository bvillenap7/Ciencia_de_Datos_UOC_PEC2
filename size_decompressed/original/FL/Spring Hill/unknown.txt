50 or 60 Reddish orange lights over Springhill, Florida.;2014-11-07 22:30:00;5 minutes;50 or 60 Reddish orange lights over Springhill, Florida. At 10:30 pm on November 7th, we lost internet and telephone, so I called to report it on my cell phone and they wanted us to check the wires out side because they where not getting a signal from us.   So I and my husband went outside to check the wires.my husband was on the side of the house looking at the wires all looked ok, so I turned around to go inside and looked at the sky.  There was like 50 or 60 of these lights, traveling across the sky at about 2000 feet high moving to the SW at a medium speed in some kind of formation there was no sound coming from them.  They were a reddish orange in color.   I yelled to my husband to come and look and he stared staring at the sky,and a truck that came to the stop sign looked and said what ((deleted)) is that as they pointed also at the sky.;28.46588396072;-82.5455320785597
