One round ball of fire floating over Spring Hill, Florida;2010-08-30 20:43:00;5 minutes;One round ball of fire floating over Spring Hill, Florida On August 30, 2010 at 20:43 my husband and I were sitting outside on our front porch when he said to me What is that? I looked over to my right and up and saw a slowly moving orange fire ball going over our house in a straight line. He knocked on the window to get the attention of my 14 year old son who looked out the window and then ran out.  Once it was over the street I ran inside for my camera. I realized my SD card was not inside of it as we just returned from Mexico. By the time i got back outside, the fire ball was gone. My husband had come in and grabbed his camera off of the counter and was able to get a few seconds of this, but it was not clear and the ball of fire looked too small and white in the video. I asked where it went and my son said it went in a straight line, never stopping, and then it curved to the left and sped up and then disappeared. We went inside and about 15 minutes later I heard a helicopter. We went outside and saw it flying slowly over our house and then in the direction that the light had come from. It proceeded to then fly over a few more times. It never went in the direction that the object flew towards. We live less than 10 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, this is the direction in which the fire ball flew. We do not get alot of helicopter activity over our home. The skies were very clear and we had a great view of the stars and I had just pointed that out. There was no breeze tonight. It is hot and muggy and it was very dark. None of our neighbors were outside. There was no sound whatsoever as this thing flew over us. No smell at all. It did not hover or stop or go in any other direction while it was over us. It went in a straight line and at the same altitude until it got pretty far then curved, sped up and disappeared. I read about Chinese lanterns, but as far as I know there are no Chinese holidays today, and these tend to be in groups and hover. Our fire ball was alone and was at a steady speed.;28.46588396072;-82.5455320785597

Weird fireball on the sky on Spring Hill, Florida.;2014-12-31 22:00:00;2:00;Weird fire ball on the sky on Spring Hill, Florida. It was shaped like a fireball, it was dark red and orange.  It was going from north to south, with no noise whatsoever.   I tried to take a picture but it wouldn't barely come up on my phone.  Now the picture isn't even in my phone anymore, it disappeared.   It's crazy because this is the second time I've seen this fireball looking shape in the sky on the month of December 2014.   We would like answer from other viewers of these events please!!;28.46588396072;-82.5455320785597
