I looked to the E morning sky that was clear blue and saw a bright round shaped object really high up. ((anonymous report));2016-10-26 08:20:00;1 minutes;Dropping my son off at school I looked to the east morning sky that was clear blue and saw a bright round shaped object really high up that stayed still the entire time I looked at it and at first I thought it was an aircraft but since I watched it for a solid minute or two and it never moved I was able to dismiss that theory.  The silver was very shiny like a star and I checked out a few airplanes after and they didn't look anything like it at all!   I had to move because of cars behind me I grabbed my camera phone and it was gone, so I'm curious if anyone else saw it.
