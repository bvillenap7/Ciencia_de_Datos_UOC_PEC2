A small silver floating ball, the size of a soft ball.;2002-07-23 18:00:00;30 seconds;A small silver floating ball, the size of a soft ball. I was about 10 years old, when my family and I was having a yard sale, after the yard sale was over y family and everyone went inside.  I stayed outside playing, when i seen a silver floating ball, that was similar to the size of a soft ball.  It was hovering about 10 feet over the street.  It followed the street for about 30 feet, until disapearing into the woods.  I dont remember hearing any strange noises, everything was silent as it passed by.  I was about 20 feet away from the ball. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));28.46588396072;-82.5455320785597
shiny gold colored sphere ~ Hernando County, FL;2006-06-19 16:10:00;3 seconds;shiny gold colored sphere ~ Hernando County, FL Coming home just now I looked up into the sky (about 2 blocks from my house) while my fiance was driving and I saw a (1) shiny gold colored sphere that was very bright and large just above the tree line. At first I thought maybe it was a headlight from a plane or something, but I quickly realized it was too low and too large. Before I could even say anything to my fiance it completely vanished. No trail, no zip, no nothing. Just vanished. I looked around for about 10 minutes to see if there was a plane or something coming out of the clouds ~ looking for a reasonable explanation ~ but there was nothing, so here I am sending you this note. It's not really dark out yet either so it was very visible.;28.46588396072;-82.5455320785597
Red-Blue color changing spheres dance over Spring Hill;2015-06-08 22:00:00;2 minutes;Red-Blue color changing spheres dance over Spring Hill Shortly after 22:00 hours on the night of June 8th a red sphere appeared on the horizon east of our house off of a Spring Hill Drive.  The sphere moved in a zig zag pattern at a high rate of speed just above the tree line.  Every time the UFO made an abrupt turn it changed colors, from bright red to bright blue and back to bright red.   Based on my estimate I would have to say that it was 1-2 miles away at most, and was between our house and veterans park which is also located on Spring Hill Drive. After about 2 minutes the sphere dipped below the tree line and vanished.  I remained outside to see if it was going to reappear for about 10 minutes and didn't see it again.;28.46588396072;-82.5455320785597
Two red glowing spheres. One was stationary in the middle, while the other made a complete circle around it.;2015-07-11 01:00:00;3 minutes;Two red glowing spheres.  One was stationary in the middle, while the other made a complete circle around it.   As the one finished its circle it moved away as it was orbiting the stationary object.  It stopped for about 20 seconds then slowly moved out of orbit and faded.   The stationary sphere slowly faded about 30 seconds after the first one faded.
