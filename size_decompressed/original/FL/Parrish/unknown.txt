UFO we could not see but heard and smelled;2009-08-20 22:00:00;30-45 seconds;UFO we could not see but heard and smelled I can assure you I am a credible witness. What occurred was by far the strangest thing that I have ever experienced. Its very simple to describe. My son, my daughter and myself were on out lanai behind our house. We began to hear a “rumble” type of sound that was very steady yet faint in the distance. I guess you could describe it as the sound of a distant jet taking off. However, the sound became louder and more clear over the course of about 45 seconds. We walked outside the lanai door to see what it was. The sound was moving above us through the air but we could see nothing but stars. As the sound approached us, it was less like a rumble and more like the sound of feedback from a speaker turned way up. Very steady and deliberate and definitely not the sound of any combustion type engine. It sounded very “bassy” and it felt as though you could look straight up to see exactly where the sound was coming from but there was nothing there at all. My son said “the air smells like a penny…like metal”. I smelled it too but I would describe it more as an electrical smell.  At one point, the sound then became more general a! nd it was very difficult to tell which direction it was coming from. It was disorienting almost making me feel dizzy. You could still tell it was coming from above and now moving away from us from the West to East. It eventually just faded away.  It was definitely something in the sky. We never seen a thing but it was without question coming from an object up there none of us could see. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));27.5595;-82.3934000000006
