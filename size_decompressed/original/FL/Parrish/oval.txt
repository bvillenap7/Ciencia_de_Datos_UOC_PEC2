single object, oval shaped, headed NE about 5 miles East of Parrish, white, 5 second duration;2009-01-18 13:25:00;5 seconds;single object, oval shaped, headed NE about 5 miles East of Parrish, white, 5 second duration I was in a chair outside my back yard watching the hawks fly (facing East), when out of nowhere this white object appears. Unfortunately, my little brother, his friend, and my step-dad had just went inside. In any case, the object looked like a plane at first, but without wings, and it was traveling way to fast, stopping, and going again. It looked like the path of lightning, but the object did not have a tail. It was headed NE about 5 miles East of me when it passed by. It disappeared just above the tree line and was gone. After  I thought it was a plane, I thought it may have been a dandelion petal, because we have dandelions in our yard, and some of them are in bloom. However, it was traveling too fast, and there was not a strong enough wind to carry it. Also, after seeing a commercial plane fly by headed north, I could estimate the crafts speed at anywhere between 2,000-2,500mph. It went roughly 4.5 times the speed of the jet. I havenâ€™t told my family. This is the first time I have seen a ufo, but my dad did once over the water in Tampa Bay. He was with someone who also saw the bright object hover over and lift of the water that night. By the way, the ufo appeared white to me, as it has in many videos I've seen.
