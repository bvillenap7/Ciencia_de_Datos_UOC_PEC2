The set of lights moved to the right dropping almost entirely behind the tree line and then left again, almost entirely behind the tree line and then entirely when it disappeared from view.  As The two witnesses called to another family member in the house to come out and he witnessed the event also.  As they turned from facing the east, to come into the house, they saw a fireball coming from the west, travel across the sky, parallel to the horizon, well above the tree line.  It disappeared as it was traveling to the east. The witness and his girlfriend were coming to his parent's house and were walking in the garden in front of the house.  He notice, as they were skywatching, an object that he thought was a tower, with lights on it, but decided that it was not, since they never saw a tower in that area.  He called to his dad, who was in the house, to come and see it.  The three of them attest to the same sighting.  It was approximately 50 degrees above the horizon in the east moving counter clockwise and then traveled to the south a bit, dropping below the tree line with only the top of the two lights showing, six in total, as on a domino, but in a boomerang shape and in a vertical position.  It then moved to the north a bit when it disappeared behind the trees.  As they turned to walk into the house they notice a fireball coming from the west crossing the horizon parallel and approx. 30 degrees above the ground and traveling approx. 200 mph.  The entire event took approximately five minutes with the first part lasting only a few minutes.  All of the dogs for miles around were howling all night long.;27.5595;-82.3934000000006
