Daytime spheres.;2006-11-14 13:15:00;2minutes;daytime spheres This just occurred a few minutes ago. I took a picture and hope it shows. I was in my back yard and noticed what at first appeared to be birds very high in the sky. The shapes were flying in a circle. I could tell they had a different color on one side and was shaped like a sphere. They were circling around because I could see them going one way but not in the other off in the distance.  After about a minute of seeing them, they formed a V pattern and moved towards the southwest. Thats when I ran in and grabbed a camera and took a photo. They were not birds.  I know what birds look like down here. They never circle in packs in formation that high. These looked to be silver and white.  I took the picture and when I looked outside the camera again, they disappeared moving in the direction of the southwest towards Bradenton and Sarasota.  The sky is perfectly clear here today.  If the camera shows the objects, I will send them to you via E-mail or USPS.;27.5595;-82.3934000000006
