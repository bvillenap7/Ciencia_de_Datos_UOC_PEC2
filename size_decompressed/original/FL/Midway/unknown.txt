White light (appear to have some shape ie.  Not a ball) this object/UFO was high in the sky coming from West heading towards the East.  It was traveling fast but not as fast as say a comet or shooting star.  We both had sat watching the starts and when I spotted the UFO I had a pair of 10x50 binoculars.  We took turns quickly watching it travelled for approx. 20-30 seconds.  Then the light and object just disappeared...it vanished.;30.485;-84.4768
