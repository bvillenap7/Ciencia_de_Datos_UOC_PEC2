BOTH MY WIFE AND I HAVE NOTICED THE SAME U.F.O FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS.;2009-01-25 19:00:00;5MIN;BOTH MY WIFE AND I HAVE NOTICED THE SAME U.F.O FOR THE PAST 2 WEEKS. LAST NIGHT WAS THE 5TH TIME WE HAVE SEE IN. AT FIRST WE THOUGHT IT WAS A BLIMP BUT WHEN YOU GO ONLINE TO LOOK AT IMAGES OF BLIMPS AT NIGHT IT LOOKS LIKE NOTHING THAT WE SAW. WHEN YOU LOOK UP U.F.O'S AN NIGHT IT LOOKS EXACT. IF THERE IS ANY WAY SOMEONE CAN LOOK TONIGHT AROUND 6:30-7PM OR EVEN ALL THE WAY TILL 9PM. THERE IS A OVAL SHAPPED OBJECT IN NORTH MIAMI CLOSE TO BYSCAYNE BLVD. IT HAS A RED LIGHT ON THE TOP AND BOTTOM AND THE ENTIRE OBJECT GLOWES WHITE NOT LIKE A LIGHT BUT LIKE A FLORECENT LIGHT. IT MOVES VERY SLOW AND FLIES LOWER THAN AN AIRPLANE. IVE SEEN IT 5X AND IM PRETTY SURE I'LL SEE IT AGAIN. IVE EVEN TRIED FOLLOWING THE OBJECT BUT IT MOVES VERY SLOW AND WHEN I REACH THE CORNER OF THE STREET ITS MOVED VERY FAST AND ITS TOO FAR AWAY. I TRIED RECORDING THE OBJECT BUT SINCE ITS AT NIGHT THE IMAGE QUALITY IS BAD.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS. ((name and e-address deleted));25.9480192982456;-80.1402692982456
