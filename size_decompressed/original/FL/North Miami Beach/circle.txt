Saw two blinking lights in clouds moving in my direction near Moon.  They stopped.  A few seconds later they started moving.  Stopped. Flashing white lights in equal distance. No sounds. The lights would turn on and off in random.  Moved in opposite direction quickly out of sight.;25.9480192982456;-80.1402692982456
