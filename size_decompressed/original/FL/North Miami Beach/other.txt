We saw a manta ray shaped object, looked like it was trying to camouflage in the sky.;2005-10-26 01:00:00;30 seconds;It was two or three days after hurricane Wilma in October 2005 in North Miami Beach, Florida, we had a black out for about two or three weeks. I'm sitting outside with a friend looking at the stars, and we saw a manta ray shaped object, looked like it was trying to camouflage in the sky.  All of the sudden starts moving and what it looked like a star had started to move and I realized it was a pale orange light flickering in the center of the front part of this object.  I could see the outline of the object.  No noise. It was moving west to east and disappeared behind the buildings next door.  The wings rippled like a real manta ray would.  Half an hour later we saw big white throbbing lights right in front of us, we got scared and ran inside. It was definitely not from this planet!  I keep doing research since, I would never forget what we saw!;25.9480192982456;-80.1402692982456
