90 degree turn, possible missing time (?);1990-07-03 23:00:00;10 minutes?;90 degree turn, possible missing time (?) Mr. Davenport and friends.  I am writing as requested of the population in general during a recent interview on Coast to Coast.  As Mr. Davenport mentioned, it is frequent for the subject of time in relation to sightings to be ‘clouded’ in a way.  It is so for myself so all dates and times to follow are VERY rough estimates. N. Miami Beach, summer of 90’ maybe 91’ and somewhere between 8:00pm and 11:00pm-&#61664  Bright star moving from right to left 1-3 miles away and 20 degrees off the horizon.  Once directly in front of me, still 1-3 miles out and same twenty degrees off horizon it changed direction instantly (90 degree angle turn) and slowly now moved towards me.  I watched as it approached for about 5 seconds and suddenly my next memory is of three large lights (the colors of which I cannot recall with any accuracy) directly in front of me about 15’ away silently hovering motionlessly at my balcony as I lay on a couch watching all this.  I remember some object directly behind the lights that left me with the impression that the lights were attached to it.  But, that memory is there for only two seconds and my next memory is of whatever it was having simply disappeared and something rumbling away overhead.  All was silent till that moment.  Around this time three tiny red puncture marks appeared on my lower left abdomen but disappeared with in a day or two.;25.9480192982456;-80.1402692982456
