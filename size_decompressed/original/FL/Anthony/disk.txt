SAW A WHIT DOT TAKE SHAPE OF A SAUCER FLOAT THERE FOR A SECOND AND THEN TAKE OFF INTO THE CLOUDS;2008-01-25 23:00:00;30 seconds;SAW A WHIT DOT TAKE SHAPE OF A SAUCER FLOAT THERE FOR A SECOND AND THEN TAKE OFF INTO THE CLOUDS On 01/25/2008 I was driving East on Hwy. 225 (Old Jacksonville Rd.) at aproxamatly 10:50 pm. A dime sized white light appeared in the sky. I thought it was a star but then it grew in size and changed its shape it resembled a salad plate in its new size and shape. It made the gauge cluster in the car I was driving go dim. This encounter lasted for about 30 seconds before the object sped off  high into the sky in a easterly direction into the clouds of the night sky.;29.3084;-82.1266
