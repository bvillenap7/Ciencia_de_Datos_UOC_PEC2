Slowly one by one the bright light started to disappear (as if the light was being turned off by a dimmer switch) in the first set of 4.  The second set of 4 - the second light from the left slowly went downward toward the earth. and then slowly disappeared. Then the first light, fourth light and third light (in that order) slowly disappeared.;27.877765116279;-81.578751744186
Six 4-foot diamter orbs observed for 15 minutes by 2 witnesses;2004-03-07 21:30:00;15 minutes;Six 4 foot diamter orbs observed for 15 minutes by 2 witnesses It was about 21:30 and we were on a camping trip.  I was sitting in my chair looking at the lake that was 20 yards from me.   Suddenly, I caught sight of an egg shaped object coming at a very fast rate of speed through a grove of pine trees and towards the lake from my left/the south.  It was zigzagging between the trees about 20’ off of the ground.  It was luminous white in color and at least 4’ in diameter.     It came to an abrupt stop at about 10’ above the surface of the lake and only about 30 yards from where I was sitting.  It hovered there for about 3 minutes,  I called my son-in-law and it sped away from the same direction from whence it had come with the same zigzag movements between the trees.   He pulled up a chair beside mine and we began to discuss what I’d witnessed.  Then from the same direction off to my left/south five objects identical in appearance to the first that I’d seen, came zigzagging through the pines, one after the other.  They came to a halt and hovered in a horizontal line about 40 yards from us at a height about 20’ above the surface of the lake.   We sat there watching them for at least 10 minutes.  They stayed in the same formation the entire time and then abruptly departed back toward the pines, but this time in a climbing mode above the pines.  We watched them until they disappeared out of sight.;27.877765116279;-81.578751744186
