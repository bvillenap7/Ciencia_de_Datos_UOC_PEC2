In the Florida sky 1/15/2001;2002-01-15 19:00:00;3min;In the Florida sky 1/15/2001 At around 7pm on 1/15/2002  in  Saddlebag Lake resort Polk co. Lake Wales, FL 33898. We were in the front drive & looking up in the north/east sky, we noticed a bright long white tail (thought exhaust) with 3 bright long orange bars in front of it at an angle. It traveled south for a little while, then not a sweeping turn, but it turned left & went up and away. As it turned we saw a big circle in the middle (silver in color, seemed to twinkle) & two smaller circles on each side that seemed to drop from the middle one and form a triangle. The smaller ones either faded out or went faster out of view. The main one the kept going until we couldn't see it any more........ WE/I Have Never seen Anything like that before.… ((NUFORC Note:  Event may have been a missile launch, possibly from a submarine.  Please see other reports.  PD));27.877765116279;-81.578751744186
It  was triangle shaped and it had bright white lights no red or green lights were present.;2008-08-07 21:00:00;5 seconds;It  was triangle shaped and it had bright white lights no red or green lights were present. It flew in from the south headed north across my back yard right above my pool. It seemed like right above my trees,it was large to be that low then it turned west and tilted sideways as it tured exposing a traingular shape and 4 bright white lights were visibl. Then it headed back southwest never gaining altitude and then disappeared. I ran for the camera but it never returned.;27.877765116279;-81.578751744186
It initially resembled a large orange light ,but once I got closer, it looked like three orange lights in the shape of a triangle.;2009-12-01 21:30:00;1-2 minutes;It initially resembled a large orange light ,but once I got closer, it looked like three orange lights in the shape of a triangle. I want to start off by saying that I am incredibly skeptical when it comes to this subject, but I witnessed something last night that I cannot explain. I attend a local college and left class around 9:30pm. On my way home (headed north on Highway 27), I saw a bright orange light ahead of me. The full moon was abnormally large, so I assumed Earth may have been extra close to a particular star or planet. The light was too big to be a plane or helicopter, and at first, it appeared to be too high up to be either of those. As I continued driving, I realized it wasn’t a planet or star, because I seemed to be getting closer to it. At this point, I was trying to figure out what in the heck I was looking at. It was too high to be a light at the top of a tower, but it wasn’t moving or blinking either. As I got closer, the object got bigger, almost as if it were floating above the new soccer field on the south end of town. I turned right on Hunt Brothers Road, and at t! his point, I had a car right on my bumper. I kept looking at the light, which appeared to be almost directly above me. When I looked up, I saw three orange lights that formed a tight triangle. I kept trying to get a better look at it, but because I was in a vehicle, it was hard to see something that close (yet still so high in the air). I nearly had my whole head of the window when the lights quickly moved east (much too fast to be a plane, jet or helicopter). When this happened, I noticed that car behind me basically stopped in the middle of the road. They must have been watching too, and when the lights moved so quickly, they slammed on their brakes. When I looked back up, the lights were gone. This is where it gets even weirder… I immediately called my husband (who is even more of a skeptic than I am!). When I started telling him what I saw, he didn’t laugh or make jokes, he was actually listening and being serious about it. After I told him what I saw, he said, “That is! so weird. I am not kidding you, I saw the same thing on my wa! y home f rom work.” He works in a city north of Lake Wales and had seen this same thing two hours before I had seen it. As he headed south on Highway 27, he saw the bright orange light. It disappeared before he made it into Lake Wales. As he traveled east on Highway 60, the light reappeared about five miles east of the Lake Wales. This time, there were three lights in the shape of a triangle. He said he kept starting until it disappeared. The distance between where I saw the triangle and where he witnessed it is about 10 miles. For two skeptics to see the same thing, at different times, in slightly different locations, and NOT be able to explain them… that is strange in itself. Part of me wants to believe it has something to do with the bombing range located to the south of us (in Avon Park), but I really can’t say.;27.877765116279;-81.578751744186
