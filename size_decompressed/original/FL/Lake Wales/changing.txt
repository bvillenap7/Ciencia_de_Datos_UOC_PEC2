UFO / MISSLE SHAPED;2020-01-06 21:16:00;7 minutes;UFO / MISSLE SHAPED Was walking dogs with my brothers wife, from over past the orange Grove hills a giant firey light came from the ground up into the sky which looked like a giant missle at first, we were freaking out thinking Iran launched an attack or something, the lights looked like it got bigger and coming like almost closer towards us and we got scared!  After that giant firey glow it looked like it was on fire like when an aircraft is entering the atmosphere, then after that firey glow was gone!! I panic to go get my Nikon P900 camera,  I don't have a tripod for it yet but I wanted to see what it was, when I came back outside my brothers wife said it disappeared, we talked and about 30seconds later, it like turned the cloak mode off and it was visible again.  I quickly tried to zoom in on it and I seen lights flashing 3-4 times and then it cloaked it self again totally!!  I wasn't zoomed in all the way and the craft looked flat in diameter, maybe could have been 50-75 feet long I'm not sure but it was distinguishable on the camera screen for those few seconds!!  I was freaking out and scared, I've seen many sightings but this was one was extremely different and scary I hope anyone else in Florida Polk County may have seen this and can relate to what I seen.;27.877765116279;-81.578751744186
