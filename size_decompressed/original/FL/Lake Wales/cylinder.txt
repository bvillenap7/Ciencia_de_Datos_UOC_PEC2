Never seen this before;2002-01-15 19:00:00;3 min;Never seen this before at around 7pm on the date above in the Saddlebag Lake resort Polk co. Lake Wales, FL 33853. We were in the front drive & looking up in the north/east sky, we noticed a bright long white tail with 3 bright long orange bars in front of it. It traveled south for a short little while, then not a sweeping turn, but it turned left & went up & away. Then we saw big circles in the middle & two smaller circles on each side coming from the bigger one. The bigger circle twinkled. the others either faded out or went fast out of view. The main one the kept going until we couldn't see it any more. WE/I Have Never seen Anything like that before....It sure has been on my mind...;27.877765116279;-81.578751744186
