We were driving east bound on hwy 60 coming out of Plok count and on my right hand side in the air(south east) about 2 oclock position I observer 3 small round shaped white lights forming a particial circle and a 4th one joining them.I said to my boyfriend look at that. He yelled pull over and grab the recorders. I did just that. we recorded and tried to annilize what was going on. At one point there were too many of these white light spots to count. Some of the lights had green and some had red lights attached. There were smoke trails all over the place as if the were going perfectly up and down. After I called 911 there seemed to be plains following them. This event kept changing. They seem to form a v then you could see them very fast leaving. We were both standing outside our truck and hear a loud but soft and s=distant sound like it could have been an air boat cranking up then shutting off after about 3 to 5 seconds. We both heard this 3 times and captured it on our voice recorder.Sounded like a low frequency almost like a alligator growning but more mechanical. We took pictures with our new camera and also our camcorder.Never did we feel threatened just very excited. I had dialed 911 and the operator said she had another report of this. I called again and the operator said she heard nothing and we kept filming until batteries ran dead. If it was ufo's I sure would like to know what it was. It was a cloudy night and when these objects seemed to leave the clouds cleared as if a big fan blew the clouds apart. My one thought was a type of small milky wave was coming thru and all the stars togeter formed a shape. It was a crazy night and I will never forget it.I do not belive in ufo's but now I can be convinced.;27.877765116279;-81.578751744186
additional information to previous report on area, also piggyback of another sighting.;2007-04-01 00:00:00;one hour;Additional information to previous report on area, also piggyback of another sighting. Re: Occurred : 9/2/2007 03:00 (Entered as : 09/02/07 3:00)  Reported: 9/6/2007 9:35:22 AM 09:35  Posted: 10/8/2007  Location: Yeehaw Junction, FL  Shape: Disk  Duration:30 sec  Close encounter of the second type. Driving northbound on yeehaw junction FL around 3:30 am. Noticed bright flashing lights white and pink in color. The tree tops were swaying back and forth and my initial thought that it was a helicopter. As I approached the object closer there were bright flashing lights and was a saucer about 15 feet above my car. It was about 200 feet in diamter and had small windows that was protruding bright lights. I drove under the craft and got the heck outta there, (there was no sound). I stopped about twenty miles later to get gas and as I got out of the car I got shocked my some type of discharge on my car. ((NUFORC Note: We are uncertain as to whether this is a serious report. PD))    In reference to the above report, I cannot say whether it is a serious report or not. However, having lived in the Central Florida region for about 20 years, I can say that many strange things have been seen along State Highway 60 and US 441.  I have seen things in the Polk County and Osceola area many times and so have others I know.  This area is desolate cow country as well as farming areas growing sod for new homes and crops.  The most desolate is between Lake Wales and Vero Beach, Fl. On the east to west 60 route and north south 441 area between Lake Okeechobee and Holopaw, Fl a small community where 441 meets 192.  Highway 60 and 441 intersect at Yeehaw Junction.   I would also like to add that south of Lake Wales on US 27 in Avon Park there is a military area known as the Avon Park bombing range.  This past spring south of Lake Wales in the direction of the Range, I noticed lights the same as those seen over Phoenix several years ago. The duration of the sighting was about an hour and I was not the only witness.  I should have reported it then, but I think the out come would have been the same.  They did not fall but where stationary, at times all lit, at the same time in a flat arc, and at other times the lead light would extinguish and immediately the rear light would come on.   Prior to this formation, all the lights were traversing through the night sky but staying in the same general area.  As I recall this was between 2100 and 2200 in late April or early May. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));27.877765116279;-81.578751744186
Star like light in the sky moving west then fading..;2013-04-27 19:00:00;30 seconds;Star like light in the sky moving west then fading.. Ufo Report: Lake Wales, FL 4/27/2013 9:38 PM   My wife and I were in our backyard gazing at the stars when I turned to the northwest to look for the moon.  At about 45 degrees I saw what I thought was a star but noticed that it was moving on what I believe would be a westerly course.  I noticed that the object was as bright as the other stars in the sky which tonight was quite bright, but it had none of the blinking lights you’d associate with an aircraft.  It must have been moving very fast and we continued to watch it for about thirty to forty as it traversed a portion of the sky.  We began to notice that it was fading and watched it until it completely faded out.  At the time it faded I'd say it was due west from us.  It was as bright as the brightest star in the sky when we first observed it.  We watch the skies regularly and we haven't seen anything like it before.;27.877765116279;-81.578751744186
Another sighting of star like craft in Lake Wales, FL;2013-04-28 20:45:00;20-30 seconds;Another sighting of star like craft in Lake Wales, FL Ufo Report – Sunday 4/29/13 – 8:50 PM Lake Wales, FL   This is my second sighting within the last few days and being a person who regularly watches the sky I’m a bit puzzled at what I’ve been witnessing.  Last night at around 8:40 PM my wife and I went out back to get some fresh air and look at the stars.  We live in an area of Florida that has little light pollution compared with some of the larger cities in the state.  As we looked up we began to discuss the object we’d seen a couple of nights before when to our surprise we began to see something similar coming toward us.  This object was similar to the first in that it was as bright as the brightest stars we could see and it had no flashing lights at all. I grabbed a pair of small Bushnell binoculars that I keep outside for spotting aircraft and quickly picked up the moving object.  This time it was heading in a trajectory that would take it directly overhead so my wife and I watched in amazement as this silent speeding object glided far overhead.  I’m a bad judge of altitude however I got the sense that it wasn’t something that was in orbit rather it was flying perhaps at several thousand feet??  As I mentioned before it was completely silent and kept a steady path.  It took it perhaps twenty to thirty seconds to traverse the sky and maintained the same level of brightness the entire time we observed it. This time it did not fade out as it did the night we saw it last. We watched it until it was beyond our field of view.  It came directly over us whereas the night before we’d seen it at an angle.  I was not able to make out anything other than the bright white light it gave off.  No other visible details were picked up by myself or my wife. I’ll be outside again tonight hoping to see it again and this time I will have my video camera. Thanks for what you do!;27.877765116279;-81.578751744186
Lights appearing in the sky in a straight line then fading away, and then returning again a few minutes later.;2018-01-30 21:00:00;few seconds;Lights appearing in the sky in a straight line then fading away, and then returning again a few minutes later. While driving home, I noticed a straight line of approximately 4 or 5 lights appear in the sky (no sound).  Then, they disappeared.  Several minutes later, while still in the car in front of my house, they appeared again in the sky for just a few seconds and then disappeared.   They were lights in a straight line - that appeared and then disappeared - almost like fireworks but not fireworks.  This was next to Lake Weohyakapka, which is also close to the Avon Park Air Force bombing range, so it could have been something related to a military aircraft (but I've never seen anything like this and there was no noise).;27.877765116279;-81.578751744186

Stopped in mid-air when I said &quotOh my God.&quot I was walking my dogs outside. I was walking towards the NW and saw a two red lights (what would be one craft) racing from left to right. I said Oh my God, as my mind registered what I was seeing was not a plane. The craft stopped when I said Oh my God, in mid-air and hovered. Then the lights turned green and then it shot straight up and hovered. Then it moved parallel (to the right) to the horizon. Then it hovered and then nose dived down behind the trees. I didn't wait to see if it would come back up as I was terrified. I called my mom on my Apple Watch and had her stay on the phone until I got inside.;27.877765116279;-81.578751744186
