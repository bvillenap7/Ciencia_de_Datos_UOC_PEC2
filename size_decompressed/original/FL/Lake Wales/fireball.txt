Orange fireball in the sky followed by four white spherical lighted ?;2007-11-18 20:00:00;3 minutes;Orange fireball in the sky followed by four white spherical lighted ? Sighted from Circle F Dude Ranch Lake Wales Florida out of the western sky large fireball falling from the sky initially thought it was a shooting star. It was orange in color and had a trailing tale. It then split into 2 falling objects of fire shortly before it appeared to burn itself out entering the atmosphere. Then a bright white sphere appeared in the same area of the sky immediately after the fireball disappeared. It moved sideways in the sky and was then joined by one then two and then a third light, all possibly coming from the first light. These four lights appeared stable in the sky and were aligned in a geometric pattern. They disappeared simultaneously, then reappeared lower in the sky, then disappeared again below the treeline. This event lasted approximately 3-5 minutes maybe. It was witnessed by at least 30-50 people, adults and children alike, some of who became scared and upset at this strange and awesome sight!

Large red/yellow fireball followed by craft similar to the space shuttle;2013-08-07 08:05:00;5 minutes;Large red/yellow fireball followed by craft similar to the space shuttle Leaving Lake Wales Florida approximately 8:05 pm on Highway 60 when there was a large red/yellow fireball in the sky that appeared that a rocket was launched.  There was a craft that looked similar to the space shuttle that continued through the atmosphere and then left.  This was very similar to the space shuttle launch but we do not have that kind of capabilities to launch a rocket in Lake Wales Florida.;27.877765116279;-81.578751744186
Another fireball sighting in Lake Wales, FL;2013-08-24 22:08:00;20 seconds;Another fireball sighting in Lake Wales, FL On the evening of 8/23/2013 my wife and I once again observed an orange fireball decending in the vicinity of our house.   As with our previous fireball sighting, it occured on an over cast night.   The fireball was noticed first by my wife as we walked out onto our back porch.  The object was pulsing slowly and without rhythm and it appeared to be decending as it headed in an E/SE direction.   The time was 10:08 PM. This is the third time we've witnessed one of these fireballs.  We look at the sky every night and these objects are very unusual.  If anyone knows what they are I'd love to hear it.;27.877765116279;-81.578751744186

At first I thought it was a fighter jet but I know it couldn't have been because it was moving straight up and it was completely quiet.  Within 35 seconds it was out of sight.   I've never seen anything like this before.;27.877765116279;-81.578751744186
