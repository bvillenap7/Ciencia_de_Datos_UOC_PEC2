Strange Orange Glowing Balls of Light in Lake Wales Area.;2007-11-17 18:30:00;5:00;Strange Orange Glowing Balls of Light in Lake Wales Area. At around 6:30 me and my boyfriend walked outside to smoke a cigarette. As soon as we sat down in my car I saw a flash of light from in the sky and then an orange colored ball of light (at the time I thought maybe a plane had blown up) started falling towards the ground. When I first seen the light I was in the front yard so as it fell I ran to the side of my house looking to the south east towards the West Lake Wales Area (I live on the west side of hwy 60 near alturas. As my boyfriend and I got to the side of the house it had split into two balls and were still falling evenly towards the ground. I called to my sister and she came out just as the two balls got just over the tree line and went out. I started explaining what I seen and one light appeared at about the same place as the other two balls had faded out and hovered above the tree line, then another light appeared, and I told my sister to grab my camera or something so we could take pictures. Then within a few seconds apart 5 lights had shown up out of no where and just hovered. Then one at a time they would move like straight up and over, or one would blink out and show up in another spot, and they made out what looked to us like a L, C, and a W. At no time did they appear to be flying or falling they hovered and glided in the sky at speeds an angles I had never seen planes or anything else do. Sometime while we were watching two people that my sister knew pulled in our yard and jumped out of the car saying they had seen it too. We have video and pictures of the video blown up so you can see. Before the lights went away they dimmed out in the same area they showed up and then one ball of light flew off in the north west direction.;27.877765116279;-81.578751744186

We were located in Tiger Creek, half way between Lake Kissimee and Tiger Lake.  It was an orange ball of fire, leaving a smoke trail behind it.  Came to a stop between an 1/8 to a 1/4 mile from us approx. 500 ft high.  As it stayed stationary, it changed to a white.   About a minute later, started moving slowly to the east.  as it moved slowly the light dimmed and went out.  we thought at first it was a helicopter crash landing until it stop at that close of a distance and you could not here it at all.  it was almost dead silent all around us.   Just reporting what we could not identify at all.;27.877765116279;-81.578751744186
