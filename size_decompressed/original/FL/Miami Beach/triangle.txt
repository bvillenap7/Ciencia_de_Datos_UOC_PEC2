2 Silent, Motionless objects over causeway to Miami Beach;2008-02-13 18:00:00;3 min;2 Silent, Motionless objects over causeway to Miami Beach I was driving east on the 41st causeway towards Miami Beach when I noticed what I initially thought to be two very bright planes one farther off to the left of the causeway over the bay and one straight ahead of me over the causeway. The intense white light was what initially caught my attention then the fact that they seemed to be motionless. As I drove forward I began to see that it was a metallic neutral tan color with lights blinking on either end.  I turned off the radio and opened the windows as I slowly drove under it and I heard no sound. It was shaped like a triangle with rounded corners. I did not see it again after I passed underneath it and did not return to investigate further. I am interested to know if anyone else saw this.;25.8052263565891;-80.1458798449613
Dim star like object freely flying and joining with others;2013-10-26 23:00:00;5-10 minutes;Dim star like object freely flying and joining with others I like to go out at night and watch for shooting stars.  This night happened to be a good night a recent cold front has came in and the sky's where fairly clear. I sat on my patio and noticed a veeeery high altitude plane flying in the SSE direction of area (it blinked a light every about 15-30 secs and seemed to be in the same spot not moving) I called for my friend to check it out because I haven't seen anything like it before , I pointed it out to him and he also saw the blinking dot high in the sky ( don't know if it was a plane or what it might have been), but it was very unusual .... The next thing I know I start to see a faint star like object moving overhead of me from the direction of that blinking light.  The object that was moving was not flashing was not getting brighter or dimmer. I watched this object move from one side of the sky to another side moving in all directions speeding up slowing down and even stopping right overhead of me.  I began to freak out asking my friend if he sees what I see and how the heck is it moving left and right stopping and freely flying across the sky like that I repeatedly said OMG a ufo OMG a ufo wtf wtf.  It seemed to move from star to star most times then it joined with 2-3 other dim objects made a boomerang like object flew for a few seconds and just disappeared.  I was speechless I don't know what I seen but what ever it was it will be stuck in my mind with me forever. I know my sky well I love spaceweather and I am very informed on space related news and objects ...  What I saw was noting close to a plane not a satellite not a comet or meteor or helicopter this was a dim star like object moving freely in any direction it wanted to in any speed it wanted to. After the 3 dim objects disappeared I was curious to see if that blinking light (plane or what ever it was ) was still there it was not anymore.;25.8052263565891;-80.1458798449613
