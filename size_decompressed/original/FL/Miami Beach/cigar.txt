Cigar shaped cloud...;2015-04-18 06:00:00;~15 minutes;Cigar shaped cloud... While my boyfriend & I were on a trip to Miami he decided to set his Canon 7D to take a Time Lapse video of the sunrise.   A week or two later took the camera out to review the video when I noticed an odd cigar shaped cloud effortlessly float by.  I asked him to slow the video down so I could get a closer view of it.  When he did I noticed  what looked like lights on in the cloud.  So I took a couple of screen shots of the frames.  Then I asked him if he could enlarge the picture.  When he did there where six different lights on it that appeared to have been changing colors.  In the three different screen shots I took the colors appear to be in different positions of the cloud shaped object.  I have the time lapse video & the screen shots I took.;25.8052263565891;-80.1458798449613
