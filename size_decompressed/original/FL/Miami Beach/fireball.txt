A fireball seeing over Miami for more than 1+ hours;2012-01-19 22:10:00;1 our +;A fireball seeing over Miami for more than 1+ hours Looking out my balcony in the direction of South, I have seeing for the last 1 hour + an object that resembles some what of a snake with a head that glow orange dark and gets a little lighter and vice versa.  The object moves like a snake and keeps hurling more or less in the same area. It moves a bit in all directions, but stays in the same general area.  I first witness it with a friend at a parking lot, then my gf got home and I showed it to her.  She is currently trying to take a good pic.

High altitude fast moving delta shaped flames.  ((NUFORC Note:  The dragon capsule had already landed, two days earlier.  PD));2020-08-04 22:00:00;1 minute;High altitude fast moving delta shaped flames My friend and I were on our patio in Miami Beach about 10 PM and I looked up and saw a strange object moving across the sky.  It looked like flames were coming off the sides of a fast moving object making a delta shape.  It was moving fast and on a consistent path across the sky.  It seemed to be high altitude and fairly bright.  I am an airline pilot so have a lot of experience lookin at objects in the sky and have seem nothing like this before.;25.8052263565891;-80.1458798449613
