this thing was round, metalic,fast and had no lights.;2001-11-18 05:30:00;10 secs;this thing was round, metalic,fast and had no lights. let me begin with  I DONT BELIEVE IN U.F.O'S  but, while i was sitting on top of the roof of my building, watching the meteor shower on 11/18/01. A round ,metalic object appeared, flying west, toward the ocean. The thing did not make any noise and it did not have any lights, it flew faster than anything i ever saw ( and NO, it was not a meteor, i've been star gazing a long time ) and just as it flew out over the ocean it made a very sharp right. It only lasted a few seconds, and then it was gone.I dont know who to tell, but i'm hoping that someone out there was watching the meteor shower and saw the same thing.;25.8052263565891;-80.1458798449613
A spherical object that moved impossibly fast, flashing light across the noon sky.;2007-06-30 12:30:00;10 Seconds;A spherical object that moved impossibly fast, flashing light across the noon sky. I was sitting on the beach looking at the Eastern sky.  There was a diverse variety of cloud formations on the horizon and clouds were passing overhead.  The Southeastern sky was clear and blue except for some very shear cirrus clouds to the Northeast.  The conditions were very good: light Southerly winds, low humidity, excellent visibility.  I was starting to look Southeast when suddenly a bright light caught my eye.   I thought at first that it was a high flying plane reflecting the noon day sun.  There were several flashes of light that moved in a Northeastern direction in a nearly flat trajectory.  I saw a bright white spherical object traveling at a speed that can only be described as impossibly fast.  It appeared seemingly out of thin air and I was somewhat startled by it.  It went from a high speed to slowing down and as it moved across the sky, it looked like it either flew into, or behind the cirrus clouds.  It also had an aura that became more pronounced when it interacted with the high level clouds.  It stopped for moment and then disappeared.  It happened very quickly, but I got a good look at it.  A strange feeling came over me as I realized that I had never seen anything like that before.  To further describe: I was sitting at sea level and I was looking skyward 45 to 50 degrees from the Southeast horizon.  It appeared as a bright light that also flashed a few times.  It looked like it was at a very high altitude, which would mean that what I saw had to be of substantial size.  It moved a good distance in what could have been no more than a second or two.  The spherical shape became more apparent when it slowed down, however it was still moving quickly.  When it stopped, it remained stationary momentarily, then it vanished.  My wife was with me when this happened.  I tried to point it out to her, but she only got a glimpse of it.  It all happened so quickly, but the image is very clear in my mind.  I have no idea what this was, but I would love to hear an explanation.;25.8052263565891;-80.1458798449613
