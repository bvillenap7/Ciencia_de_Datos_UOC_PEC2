10 bright lights move slowly north across south beach sky in 1975;1975-06-30 20:00:00;5 minutes;10 bright lights move slowly north across south beach sky in 1975 While outside at night at the apartment complex where I lived (Lenox Avenue)a saw about 10 very large bright lights moving very slowly in a north direction.  There was no sound but the lights were very bright and round. The lights were lined up from left to right at with equal distance from each other. They hovered very slowly moving across the sky in a north direction until moving away from our sight. About 6 of us all outside at the time saw the same thing.  This happended in south Miami Beach in 1975. I was in 5th grade at the time. I am not sure of the exact date. But it was night time about 8PM. I am certain of what I saw and can recall with detail everything about the episode. I have for years searched Miami Herald archives to see if this was reported but have not been successful in finding an info yet. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Two bright lights hovering around Downtown Miami skyscrapers for 20 minutes, then descended into the ocean together.;2009-08-20 01:30:00;20 minutes;Two bright lights hovering around Downtown Miami skyscrapers for 20 minutes, then descended into the ocean together. I was on the roof of my apartment building (17 floors up) in Miami Beach and looking out towards the Downtown Miami skyline. I noticed two stationary bright lights alongside different skyscrapers. Since the Miami airport is also visible from that point of view, I first thought they were far-off planes, though no other planes in the sky radiated anywhere near as much light. I immediately dismissed this first theory when I noticed the lights start hovering freely around the skyscrapers, sometimes in a circular manner, other times floating from the base to the tip of buildings (and vice versa) in a matter of seconds. I've never seen a human aircraft of any variety move so freely and quickly as these lights did. They continued to circle the buildings for about 15-20 minutes until they both suddenly rose into the sky together and descended into the bay/ocean.;25.8052263565891;-80.1458798449613
Out my bedroom window and out hovering in the sky over the ocean a  bright small light shined for 5 hrs.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star?  PD));2011-08-05 00:00:00;5 hours;Before going  to bed at 11:58 pm. I look out my bedroom window and out hovering in the sky over the ocean a  bright small light shined for 5 hours.  From my point of view the light was in-between  two beach front buildings.  The caymon ranch and the sterling apartments .   For 5 hours, I stayed up looking in out of my window hoping for it to be a helicopter or something else, but I notice it rose quite a bit from the last time I checked up on it .nothing else was in the sky for miles.  Then hours later the light faded away.  Everything was silent their wasn't any distant bodies of a aircraft or anything remotely sounding like a aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  Star?

Fire flies in South Beach.;2015-04-25 23:00:00;~3 seconds;Fire Flies in South Beach At around 11pm I was sitting in my living room.  I live in a high-rise in Miami Beach and I have a city view.  I was looking through the open sliding glass door, (I was sitting in front of), at the time, when suddenly a bright light appeared from behind a building.  At first, I thought it was fireworks, but I quickly realized that this was not the case. It was seemingly in close proximity and flying at about the same height as my apartment.  I am on the 5th floor and these things were in my line of view, looking due west, and were visible for a few seconds.  The only way I can describe them is that it looked like flying fire.  They were 5 or 6 feet across, in my estimation, maybe larger.  They appeared solid, not translucent.  What I could see was a flat surface which didn't look to have much if any depth. They came from behind buildings that lay in my line of vision and then disappeared from sight the same way, going behind another adjacent building to the north.  If I had to guess, I would say that it was about a block or so away!  First there was one, then a second appeared, which seemed to split off the other.  They moved in a way that could not have been fireworks, swirling around themselves, or interacting for a moment and then speeding off to the north. As these fiery things moved through the air, the tail of the flames undulated in such a way as resembling a flag in the wind.  As it did so, small flames were left behind like a trail, but immediately dissipated.  Gravity and the laws of physics had no effect. There was an absence of smoke and sound, so I rule out fireworks.  There was nothing to indicate to me that there was any human involvement and it was unlike anything I've ever imagined.  I was quite shaken after seeing that, somewhat frightened. I don’t know if I can correctly recall the color, but it was bright and looked like fire.  I believe it was orange and red but there could have been other colors.  I was so astonished and it all happened so quickly, but I got a very good look at them.  They, whatever they were, had no apparent shape, other than the appearance of fire. It could not have been a projection.  The was nothing in the air space where they appeared for them to be projected on to, and they were above the lower 2 and 3 story buildings in the space where I could clearly see them.  I ran out to the balcony, but by then there was no sign of them. I occurred to me that someone else must have seen it.  I have lived in this apartment for 5 years and I have gazed in this direction countless times.  I have tried to figure out what happened that night, lost sleep over it and have come to the conclusion that either I had a hallucination, or I witnessed something unknown, not to mention extremely bizarre by any standard.   Since I am not prone to “seeing things” then I tend to believe the later. It’s very strange circumstances, because the objects, if I can call them that, appeared in a densely populated area with many tourists and people walking around.  South Beach is very active at least until 2AM.  Before midnight there are scores of people and heavy traffic in my neighborhood.  How could I have been the only one to have witnessed it?  I was out on my balcony immediately when I saw them, but like I said, they had disappeared by then.  I am less than a block from where it seemed to have occurred.  I heard no exclamations or commotion.  I also did not see any smoke or hear any explosions such as fire works-I definitely would have heard that. This is such an unbelievable occurrence that I have trouble believing it myself.  Nevertheless, I saw a pair of self-illuminating fire like objects flying through the air with what seemed to be some form of intelligence.  I have no idea what it was, but it was unlike anything in from my imagination.  It was but for a few seconds, but I will remember it forever.;25.8052263565891;-80.1458798449613
