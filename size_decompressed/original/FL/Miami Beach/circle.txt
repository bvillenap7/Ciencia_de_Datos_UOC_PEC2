I went to go get my Dads binoculars to get a closer look and when I came back it was gone. And one of the most strange things is that it happened on feb. 29 (leap year). It was like nothing I've ever seen before;25.8052263565891;-80.1458798449613

Green circle had ribbed edges, or some kind of pattern.  It was not smooth-line edge.  It was rather large and disappeared behind cloud.  There were few clouds present.  Amazing sight.  We were stunned.  No sound.  Trajectory reminded that of a shooting star.  Very bright colors.  ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, who corrected the date.

Noticed a small dot similar to the size of a star or satellite.;2017-07-03 20:30:00;1-2 hours;Laying on beach on back looking towards sky.  Noticed a small dot similar to the size of a star or satellite.  The only issue was it was moving from the ocean to towards the beach.  I figured it was a plane, then noticed its altitude in relation to the overhead planes leaving the airport to that of a satellite.  Then I thought to myself satellites move in a straight line. As the object came over the beach it began to make erratic movements like slightly back and forth, left to right and in circles.  Still this looked like a satellite, but it was changing speed and direction like nothing I'd ever seen in the sky.  I pointed it out to my friend and she said the same, it looked like a satellite, then when it started moving in circles she said, what the hell is that?  Again this looked like a satellite or star, but moved more like a drone of some sort.  It was way to high to be a drone though, again planes passing were below it.  It seemed somewhere between the stratosphere and mesosphere, very high up. No flashing lights or anything, maybe a weather balloon?  My friend and I had seen anything in the sky move the way it did. I went into the water and came back to see if I could find it again with the stars.  Again, spotted it by its movement moving towards the city away from the water, but staying above the beach.;25.8052263565891;-80.1458798449613
I observed red flashing lights sometimes alternating to greenish and yellow color.  ((anonymous report));2018-11-23 23:05:00;7-8 minutes;I observed red flashing lights sometimes alternating to greenish and yellow color. Above my porch on Indian Creek Drive and 41st Street Miami Beach Florida November 23rd, 11:05 p.m. For the first few minutes of my observation it was in a fixed position not even moving. After 5 or 6 minutes  I took out my  phone video as I was filming it started moving very very slowly towards the northern direction as I was facing south.  Suddenly it just sped away  like a blink of an eye  towards the northern Direction which I couldn't see it anymore  since I have an overhead porch. It definitely was not an airplane or a helicopter because it was soundless, in addition it did not fit the lighting configuration of an aircraft or helicopter, which I'm very familiar with, since I fly planes myself. Again it was just a bunch  of red flashing beacons  and sometimes alternating to greenish yellow color. I took some video footage but just for the last few seconds before it disappeared as my hand was not steady so it seems like it was moving but it was just actually moving very very slowly towards the end of this phenomena  before it just vanished  towards the North direction..
