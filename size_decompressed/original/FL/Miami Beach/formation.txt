20 lighted objects orange color vertical shape flying over Miami Beach;2012-02-29 20:00:00;9.00 PM;20 lighted objects orange color vertical shape flying over Miami Beach At 8.30 pm I was on Collins Avenue and 26 Street having a coffee outside a coffee shop. There were around 15 other persons. 3 of them began to shout : look at that!! I even called the manager of the coffee shop to come out. 20 (another person looking at them counted 21)orange color lighted UFO´s began flying slowly and far, from south to North. Since tonight is very cloudy, the objects began disappearing once they reached heavy clouds. They were all going slow, so we could look at them for a space of maybe 4 minutes? But the last object was going faster than all others. A small plane was going the opposite way (morth to south), and I guessed they were checking those objects.     I continued checking from my balcony, and did not see them again yet. Very, very strange. They were NO planes. My balcony looks at the airport, and I am accustomed to watch planes all the time. By other hand, comparing the speed of them to the small plane and 1 big plane leaving the Miami Int´l Airport allowed us to compare speed: planes were going faster.  (The small one and commercial one),  These objects where lighted, dark orange, in the shape of an ¨l¨or thin cigar, vertical shape. If anybody saw them , or have an explanation, pls. inform.
