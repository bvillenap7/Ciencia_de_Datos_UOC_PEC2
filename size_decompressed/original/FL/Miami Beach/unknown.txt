Slow moving silver metalic object, would seem to turn red, no comtrail, moving very slow west to east.;2003-03-03 09:35:00;several min.;Slow moving silver metalic object, would seem to turn red, no comtrail, moving very slow west to east. Husband just called me from Miami, he is working down in south Florida and is a crane operator, he has to look up a lot for the type of work that he does and has just witnessed some type of object in the sky, still watching it as we were on the phone. He called me all excited to turn on the news and see if there was anything about a UFO being reported in the south Florida area. He pointed it out to several workers and no one could say what it was. I asked him for the shape but he could not give me an answer, he said you could see it was a silver metallic color and every now and then there was red. He was ABSOLUTELY sure it was not a jet, also there was no comtrail. I had him hold his thumb up at arms length and it did cover it. It was moving very slow from the west to the east. (He has had more than this 1 sighting being that he works outdoors, but this one really excited him) ((NUFORC Note:  We have attempted to call the wife, who submitted the report, on several occasions, but the telephone has been busy on each occasion.

Very fast object that stops then comes back;2012-09-11 05:50:00;15 seconds;Very fast object that stops then comes back I was out in my backyard with my 2 dogs at 5:50 am.  It was still dark with a few scattered clouds. I was looking at the sky and saw a very bright object moving very fast and very high coming from the west heading north north-east.  I was wondering if it might be a satellite. The object looked very bright white and was too high for me to discern any shape other than a ball of bright white light it looked similar to Venus on a clear night but much bigger. As the thought was going through my head as to whether it might be a satellite, the object suddenly stopped.  After about 2 seconds, it headed back South (towards my house) very slowly then stopped again. At that point I got very uncomfortable and went back inside the house with the dogs. It was as if this object was making me aware that it definitely was not a satellite. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));25.8052263565891;-80.1458798449613
