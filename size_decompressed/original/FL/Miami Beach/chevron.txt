On Tuesday October 25th 2005, during the Hurricane Wilma blackout, while standing on my balcony, I saw a large boomerang shape, fly from North to South across Miami Beach, with no lights or sound.  The object moved at a steady rate of speed, directly above Miami Beach.  I could track the object with the naked eye, as it moved approximately 30 seconds across my field of view.  The object then became obscured by other buildings. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he seemed quite objective, eloquent, and reliable to us.  We suspect that he is quite reliable as a witness, and that his report is reliable.  The object is reported to have had no lights on it, which rules out any type of aircraft, we believe, and it traversed an arc of approximately 90 degrees, as viewed from the vantage point of the witness, during the time he observed it.
