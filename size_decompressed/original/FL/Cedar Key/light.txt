We were on a dock at the shell mound park fishing, and it was about 10 pm or so and we were all looking at the stars with binoculars and we also had our video camera. We saw the one very bright star in the west it seemed to very akward because it looked to be moving and changeing colors,  We watched it move across the sky and get very bright and change colors to red and white yellow and green.  My two boys saw it shoot somthing down and appear to dreg a smaller light, I could not see this but my girlfreind could.  I was probally the same light that the lady in L.A could see on the same night as reported by CNN.,. It after about 10 minutes got dim and then stayed in one spot. What we were looking at was not a star. When we watche the video on the t.v  I zoomed in on the light 600x,s and of course it got blury with digital pixels but the lights were clearly visable and the shape was sorta like a hexagon.  It was very far away and probaly over in L.A it was moving a lot but this far away it only seemed to be a short distance.;29.1686;-83.0184
