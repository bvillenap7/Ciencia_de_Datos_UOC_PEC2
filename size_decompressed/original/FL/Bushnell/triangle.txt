It's perimeter was light up a burgundy color. I went outside to check the current temperature at my weather station located in the middle of a 20 acre pasture in a rural are 10 miles west of town. It was a clear and very cold night with a dead calm wind and no moon so it was very dark. Suddenly I felt a breeze come up at approximately 5 mph. As a Space & Atmospheric Weather Forecaster I instinctively looked up and much to my surprise saw a diamond shaped object at a zenith of approximately 70 deg. The object was completely light up all along the edges with a dull very dark red or burgundy color. It made absolutely no noise and was moving northward at a slow rate of speed. I sized it up by stretching my right arm upward and at that distance comparing it to my finger length. It was as long as my middle finger. I watched it for approximately 5 minutes until it disappeared across the northern horizon.;28.6618;-82.1552999999999
