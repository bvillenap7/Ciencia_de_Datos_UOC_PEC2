Multi-colored blinking orb hovering and moving erratically w. coast of Florida;2012-01-24 23:55:00;30;Multi-colored blinking orb hovering and moving erratically w. coast of Florida We live in Chiefland, Florida, and have the luxury of dark skies.   On Tue Jan 24 around midnight (new moon, clear skies) my husband was walking a letter to the mailbox when he saw something strange in the sky and called me to come see.  It was very far away, hovering just above the tree line.  It appeared as a very bright star that continuously blinked with all colors.  We watched it for at least 15 minutes as it hovered and occasionally moved erratically left, right, up down, back and forth.  After observing for some time we ruled out the possibility of it being a star, a satellite, a plane, a helicopter or a balloon because none of those objects have the ability to make the kinds of movements that this object was making. It was very far away and all we had to magnify with was a pair of binoculars. In the binoculars it appeared as a pinpoint (orb) and was very far but closer than a star appears in binoculars.  When it went below the tree line we drove to a local field to continue to observe it.  It was still there but appeared to have move further south.  It was still too far away for us to be able to clearly identify it.  The area this object would have been observed is the Gulf of Mexico, west coast of Florida, around the Cedar Key area.;29.4846;-82.8765
