Two cigar shaped UFOs meet near a small plane in the afternoon Florida sky.;2003-10-15 17:00:00;2 or 3 minutes;Two cigar shaped UFOs meet near a small plane in the afternoon Florida sky. I was playing outside with my two sisters and I looked up in the sky and saw a small plane.  It was flying normally, but I saw something out of the corner of my eye and it was a cigar shaped UFO.  It appeared to be approaching the plane from the east.  Then I saw another UFO approaching from the west.  The two met near the plane and they both turned around and went back the way they came and disappeared over the tree line.  It was really strange.  They seemed to be drawn to the plane.
