Two brightly glowing objects sighted about 100 degees during twilight at about 40-50 degrees above the horizon.;1998-03-07 19:50:00;5 minutes;Two brightly glowing objects sighted about 100 degees during twilight at about 40-50 degrees above the horizon. Two brightly glowing, disk-shaped objects sighted 3-7-98 at approx- imately 1855 EST. Objects were at about 100 degrees magnetic and 60 degrees elevation above horizon. Relationship to each other was line- abreast formation, and movement was extremely slow, and toward East. Unable to tell altitude due to bright glowing aura about them. After 3-4 minutes object on right started to fade rapidly until it disappeared about 15 seconds later. Object on left of formation also faded similarly, but a minute or so after first. Individual objects were very similar in shape to those captured on video tape over Phoenix, AZ in 1997. Incident observed by 4 adults: 1.  53-year old male, retired F-15 pilot, with 35 years flying and DoD industry experience (no prior sightings) 2.  Wife of observer #1, 52-year old female (no prior sightings) 3.  58-year old male, retired USAF EWO/Navigator, with almost 40 years flying and DoD industry experience (no prior sightings) 4.  Wife of observer #3, 54-year old female (no prior sightings) ((NUFORC:  Excellent description of probable missile launch at sea by U. S. submarine.

We watched this object move from left to right and it looked like it was gliding not flying.  We both first thought that it was a helicopter or something but then it statrted to move away and come back in a motion that we knew it wasnt a regular air craft.  My boyfriend is skeptic about it.  He is assuring himself that it was a really bright star and he clouds were making the object to appear to move.  I watched the object for 3 hours and finally  as the daylight came this object slowly went away.  I watched it move farther and farther with a small trail of light behind it.  As daylight came I made him look over in the same spot and see that it was not a tower and that there is no way possible fot it to have been a really bright star like he wants to make himself believe.  I know what I saw!;26.9237273972603;-82.0255630136986
Airplane like UFO turns on a row of lights  after coming to a complete stop in front of me.;2008-04-11 20:34:00;3 minutes;Airplane like UFO turns on a row of lights  after coming to a complete stop in front of me. I was leaving my cousins house and as I approached the stop sign I saw in the distance real low, two bright lights like those of an airplane. I thought to myself wow an airplane here? the only big planes that fly here are skybus and they are out of business so I sat there watching it and as it approached me, the lights got brighter and all of a sudden it stopped. It was maybe 1,000 feet above me straight ahead and it just stopped. Then all at once, about 5 more lights flashed on. It was huge! As soon as I saw it I knew what it was and I started screaming hysterically and crying. I could see the exact saucer shape of it with a smaller half circle light on the top. I got the goosebumps and chills made my turn watched it for like 10 seconds after the turn and then it was gone. It just disappeared and I continued screaming and crying clenched onto my steering wheel. It was the scariest thing ever.

Three disc objects flying 30 k ft overhead.;2019-03-27 13:00:00;20 seconds;Three disc objects flying 30 k ft overhead. I was at a county park with 2 family members.  We all were looking in the sky and noticed something that looked like white metal in a cloud.  We thought it might have been the International Space Station reflecting off light from the sun.  As we continued to watch the sky, I saw three disc shape objects in a triangle formation flying by.  They were well over 30,000 feet in the sky.  The discs looked identical.  They were equally half white and half of a grey shade with a dividing line of symmetry along a diagonal line.  They seemed to just be floating by in the clouds. There was no sound that I could hear from the objects.  Not sure what to make of it.  Could be spacecraft from another world.  It could be government technology that disguises jet aircrafts.  Anything is possible at this point. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));26.9237273972603;-82.0255630136986
