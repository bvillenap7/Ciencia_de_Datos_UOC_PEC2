I saw 3 triangular craft in the night sky over my home in Florida.;1998-11-05 02:00:00;30 seconds;I saw 3 triangular craft in the night sky over my home in Florida. I had just gotten home at 2:00am, the date i'm unsure of ,and it was such a beautiful night to check the stars i looked up and saw three triangular craft flying in unision all three had what looked like lights around the outside of the wings and to put it bluntly they then moved into the sky at such ammazing speed they disappeared. There were no clouds in the sky just a great night to star gaze with the naked eye when i saw these craft. At first i thought they might be part of the stealth fighter group stationed 90 miles away at Mcdill AFB in Tampa untill watching the news locally out of Ft.Myers they showed a picture of the same craft which in the picture there was only one. So this was my own personal experience seeing UFO's. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));26.9237273972603;-82.0255630136986
I saw 1 red, 2 white lights in triangular formation hovering in the night sky then vanished;2019-04-23 22:24:00;2 minutes;I saw 1 red, 2 white lights in triangular formation hovering in the night sky then vanished I was traveling on Route 41 crossing over the bridge from Port Charlotte, FL, into Punta Gorda, FL.   I looked to my left and noticed three lights in the sky that were in a formation of a triangle.  It appeared the top light was red in color and the bottom two were white, none were flashing.  It was moving at a slow speed and was going higher, but the lights did not appear to get smaller as it was moving away.  I then made a left turn onto Boca Grande Blvd and it was GONE!!  I proceeded onto Taylor Road and saw an aircraft that looked normal with the usual flashing lights and it was headed in the same direction as the triangular lights were previously headed in.  It was almost as if it was searching for what I was seeing.  Since I was driving and had cars around me, I could not get a photo or video of it.  I was finally at my destination and never saw those triangular lights againâ€¦;26.9237273972603;-82.0255630136986
