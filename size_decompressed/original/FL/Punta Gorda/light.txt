See below for more on shape and number of craft;1999-05-13 21:00:00;4 sec;See below for more on shape and number of craft While playing acoustic music at a city park, two of us in a circle of five were facing South-East when a brilliant light streamed across the sky in a Southwesterly direction.  We've had air shows at our local airport and at first I didn't think it was anything we couldn't come up with.  It was too bright to distinguish a form but the light remained oblong then suddenly it split, that is, a section of it shot forth. I later came home and heard a caller on Art Bell describe this except that what I saw was MUCH brighter than Venus.;26.9237273972603;-82.0255630136986

Something is up out there and I would advise people to start watching the eastern sky in SW Fl between 2am and 6am.I am not saying anything because I know what my thoughts always were. I still think there are many out there who just need to get a life yet something has been going on up there.  I have observed some objects back in November that I find somewhat upsetting as a sane rational human.      SOMETHING IS OUT THERE AND IT DOES NOT SEEM TO CARE THAT WE KNOW IT.

Intense white light surrounded by a mist over Punta Gorda Florida;2001-06-25 21:15:00;3-5 Minutes;Intense white light surrounded by a mist over Punta Gorda Florida 9:15 pm. June 25th 2001 my wife and I walked outside to see a friend off, and looked toward the east and at what I would estimate to be about 25,000 ft., there was an intense white light similar to an aircraft landing light, but more brilliant and appeared to me surrounded by a mist.  This object lit up the entire cloud of mist, and appeared to also be shining downward, lighting the entire area below it. We watched as the object appeared to be moving to the west, when it suddenly shot vertically at about 45 degrees to an almost indeterminate altitude and moved at great speed to the southeast and disappeared from sight. The cloud which extended vertically and appeared to be several thousand feet high continued to glow white for several minutes after the object departed and drifted directly overhead, having moved from east to west. From our home here we often watch the Space Shuttle launch, and this object was way too far south to have come from the Kennedy Space Center, and we saw no indication that this object came from ground level. I am a former Police officer and pilot, and can judge altitude and speed pretty well, but this object, accelerated from almost zero to what had to be 3 or 4 thousand MPH in a burstand was gone. My wife and I are ardent sky watchers and frequently spot sattelites and the ISS, and can tell you that this was neither, and the intensity of the very WHITE light is inconsistent with the orange-yellow glow of a rocket, and I am familiar with just about every OTHER kind of conventional aircraft there is.....I have been involved with Warbirds, and almost every thing that flies,  and this doesn't fit ANY type of aircraft I know of. The event was of too short a duration for me to get to a camera, so regrettably, I missed this one.

Pulsating light traveling steady with abrupt change of course, and accelerating outward suddenly;2010-04-03 12:00:00;4 min;Pulsating light traveling steady with abrupt change of course, and accelerating outward suddenly The event was on april 3, 2010.  About 12 pm. My grandson and I were staying in my sailboat, located in Punta Gorda Fl.  I had him take the front bunk in the catamaran which has an opening hatch over the bunk.  He commented to me, that he could clearly see the stars as he lay there and we then we said good night. Shortly after this, he claims he was watching a large reddish, pulsating object progressing northward and wondered if it might be a satellite, but thought is was too big.  He claimed it to be as big as a silver dollar if held at arms length. About this time, the pulsating light took a sudden turn downward and made a figure S and then shot upward very, quickly upward and out of sight. The event only lasted a few minutes.  I was told the story when we got up in the morning. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));26.9237273972603;-82.0255630136986
