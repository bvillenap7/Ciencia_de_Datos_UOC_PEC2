odd bright object with comet like tail in Southern Florida.   ((NUFORC Note:  Titan 4 launch from Cape Canaveral.  PD));2003-09-09 00:30:00;5mins;((NUFORC Note:  A launch of a Titan 4 rocket from Cape Canaveral  was conducted at 00:29 hrs. on this date.  We suspect that the launch was the cause of the several reports NUFORC received from multiple points in Florida.  We post the reports to illustrate how easy it is to misidentify a relatively commonplace event.  Even we were intrigued by the reports, when they first were submitted, and it took us approximately 12 hours to identify the apparent source of the reports.
