A basketball-sized green light hovered along the ground, then flew horizontally along a tree line and then shot up totally vertical at incredible speeds and disappeared completely from view.   This was approximately 100 feet away from both witnessing parties.  It's a very clear night with good visibility and it went from ground level to out of site in seconds.;26.9237273972603;-82.0255630136986
A small  white circular object low in the sky;2015-02-11 16:40:00;2 seconds;A small  white circular object low in the sky I saw one circular object white in color around the level of small planes go from north to south, from the west side of my house.  The object was small and it went behind a palm tree and I got up to look at it again it was gone.  I was sitting in a chair with my dogs and I looked up and saw the object only for two seconds.  The sky was blue and clear so the object stood out.  The object looked to me to be a small object but it happened so fast that I really don't know how high the object was in the air but I'm guessing what the height of it was.;26.9237273972603;-82.0255630136986
