Teal/White/Red light hovering near my place of employment.;2014-10-21 00:00:00;2-3 minutes;Teal/White/Red light hovering near my place of employment. I work right across the harbor here in Punta Gorda, and I'm not sure what I saw.  And this isn't the 1st night I saw it either.  It was a teal/white/red light - and it would shoot UP into the sky, move from right to left occasionally, and then float back behind some trees.  I want to say it has something to do with the airport not to far from here, but I cannot explain it. The first night I saw it, it was pointed out to me - nor the other witness and I could explain the sighting.  It was creepy.;26.9237273972603;-82.0255630136986
