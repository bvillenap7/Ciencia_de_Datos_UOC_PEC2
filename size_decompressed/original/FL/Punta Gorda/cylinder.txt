Multiple Tic tac shape flying objects in a few hours.;2021-07-22 08:00:00;4 hours;Multiple Tic tac shape flying objects in a few hours. White, tic tac shape object very very high in the sky. Moving fairly fast. I watched from my patio as it flew right above my head. I watched it in disbelief because I could tell this wasn’t an airplane. We live near an airport so a drone couldn’t be flown that high. I could tell the size comparison as we have large buzzard birds flying high above and you could tell the object was higher than the birds. No audible sound. I watched it fly for a few minutes and noticed it would catch the sun just right every once in awhile and looked like tin foil gleaming in the sun. Then it would shift again and be pale white in color again. All of a sudden it vanished. I told my 17 yr old daughter as she came outside and she said “ya right” and when I looked up a new one came from behind me-same shape, speed, height. But it came from a different angle this time. We both watched it until it flew into the same spot in the sky the last one did and it vanished as well. I did go ! get my husband and he came out to investigate and debunk our UFO situation. He was left dumbfounded when several more came over the next few minutes. Again, all from different areas in the sky, but they all went to the same place in the sky before disappearing. Every hour or so I’ve looked up and I’ve waited and sure enough, as I was swimming I looked up and saw a commercial airliner. I watched it for a few minutes when all of a sudden-one of those white things came hauling tail at this plane. I mean FAST. It looked like it was gonna hit it T-Bone style, but it missed. I thought I was going to faint in the pool. My daughter took several videos and posted them online. We figured we better report this because so far it’s been a long day of sky watching. Which also peaks my curiosity of what we can see tonight in the dark.;26.9237273972603;-82.0255630136986
