Orange fireball over Punta Gorda, Fl. 11/10/2013 approximately 1930 hours.;2013-11-10 19:30:00;15-20 seconds;Orange fireball over Punta Gorda, Fl 11/10/2013 approximately 1930 hours. It was dark out and partly cloudy. I noticed an orange flickering ball of light coming from the Northeast traveling Southwest.  There were no aircraft type lights no headlights, no strobe lights, nothing red or green, just this orange ball that flickered the way a camp fire in the distance would appear.  It flew below the clouds, I'm guessing at a height of 5,000 to 7,000 feet and traveled at a speed consistent with prop or jet aircraft on landing approach. Again, guessing about 150 to 300 miles per hour.  It did not leave any kind of trail. I was facing North and this object passed from my right to left.  The whole time, about 15-20 seconds, it never changed speed or direction, nor intensity of light.  Watching it come and go, the ball of fire appearance never changed it appeared the same coming as it did going.  What made me think this was a noteworthy experience was the complete silence of the entire event.  I never heard a sound, when normally aircraft within this range of vision can be heard, especially when they have traveled psst my vantage point. I'm reporting this as confirmation should you receive a more detailed report and or video of this event.;26.9237273972603;-82.0255630136986
Observing New Year's Eve festivities from lanai over Charlotte harbor when reddish orange fire like orb was spotted moving east to west;2015-01-01 00:30:00;15 seconds;Observing New Year's Eve festivities from Lanai over Charlotte Harbor, when reddish orange fire like orb was spotted moving east to west at a slow rate of speed in a direct and straight path.  Almost looked like attached to string (which could not have been possible) it was so direct and slow.  About 30-40 feet above water.   Near large tourist destination where festivities were occurring.   Hoping others may have seen and report once I do.;26.9237273972603;-82.0255630136986
