It was a very clear night and I glanced up toward the sky.  Very high in the sky, I saw what I first thought was an airplane, but the lights were pulsing off and on (not fast, it was on a couple seconds went by the off).  When the lights were off, I could not see anything and when they came back on, they were in the shape of a cross (not a plus sign -- a cross)  This object was going south.  Then I glanced over to the west and lo and behold, another one was coming from the west and made a turn south.  It was following behind the first one.  I watched until I could no longer see them.  I was told by my neighbor (who is a former air traffic controller) that they probably were jets flying into Ft. Myers International Airport.  I question that though because I think the airlines have lights on their planes at all times during the night.  When these lights went off, you could see nothing.  This just didn't seem normal to me.  I couldn't hear anything either, but as I said, they were very high in the sky.  They were so high in the sky, that they looked like the size of my hand.  Please feel free to contact me is you have any questions.;26.9237273972603;-82.0255630136986
