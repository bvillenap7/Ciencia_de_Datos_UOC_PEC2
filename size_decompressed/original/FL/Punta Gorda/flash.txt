flashes and power failure in florida;2003-11-14 20:00:00;seconds;flashes and power failure in florida While relaxing on a clear evening sipping a cup of coffee, I was gazing almost straight up into the sky when I saw what appeared to be a white flash...The flash dwarfed any of the stars in the sky and was obviously not an airplane headlight.  A few seconds later, a smaller, less intense flash appeared about 2 degrees to the left of where the original flash had been.  I probably would not have given the incident a second thought, except that later that night (about 4:00 am) I observed what appeared to be a helicopter approaching my car.  When the aircraft was almost directly overhead, the headlights on the car went dead.  I was not able to get them to come back on until after the aircraft was out of sight (about 15 seconds).;26.9237273972603;-82.0255630136986
