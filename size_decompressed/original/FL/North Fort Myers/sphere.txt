One object disappears leaving a ring cloud. 15 second later the 2nd does the same. My wife and I were going out for dinner on Saturday evening, 6:40 PM. Three blocks from our home, we turned east onto Skyline. I observed two glowing lights clouded in a haze about 40 degrees from the horizon. Both objects appeared to be stationary and it was difficult to tell the distance. The objects as they appeared to us were about ten times  the size of a star. The object on the left was slightly lower and equally spaced from the object on the right. We had an unobstructed view. We stoped the car and observed both of the objects for about 20 seconds. The object on the right then disappeared, leaving behind a donut shaped cloud. The second object remained for about 10 seconds, and then disappeared like the first.
