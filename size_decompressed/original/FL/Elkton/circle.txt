2 almost invisible, circular UFO sighting;2019-10-14 07:00:00;15 seconds;2 almost invisible, circular UFO sighting I was driving to work. It was on a road with lots of farm land. The sky was a weird color, like yellowish because the sun was just rising. Something caught my eye. It was moving through the sky along the tree line going the opposite direction of me. I slowed down thinking it was a smudge or something on my window. It was circular. It looked like it was almost invisible but it wasn’t. There was like a shadow or just slightly darker area. It was moving so precise and steady. I kept staring until I couldn’t see it anymore as it headed the opposite way. Then, not far behind it came another one, going the same way.;29.7876;-81.4609
