Five ship amber diamond formation (fifth above diamond at 10-11 o'clock postiotion) to 45 deg. hor. slant;2005-11-07 18:30:00;5 min;Five ship amber diamond formation (fifth above diamond at 10-11 o'clock postion) to 45 deg. hor. slant Approx. 6-8 miles east/north east from Hurlburt field florida at flt level 8 to 120.  Diamond shape (four ship) foramation with amber lights and one (out of formation) at 10:00 to 11:00 clock position above formation.  At approx 1830 L traveling east bound on highway 98 at above said proximity lights were extremley apparent.  I pulled off into the left turn lane to apposing traffic to get a view of this strange formation which seemed to be very nonstandard FAA type acft and certainly not any military or civilian acft (about 15 to twenty miles distance from view point).  I was backing traffic and pulled off into subdivision almost directly accross from Fuji chinese restaurant (verifiable palme or palmero subdivision of sort) sound side.  Two other unknown sepectators already at postion watching and bewildered as I was...after approx 2-3 minutes formation moved up and down accordingly with respective position into a 45 degree line with horizon. From low to high ascending order each ship decended one at a time with lights fading from bottom to top extingushing.  Oddly, fighter and or military traffic in the area slightly below altitude 8-10 nautical miles west of formation approaching and retreating within border.;30.4212;-86.8926
