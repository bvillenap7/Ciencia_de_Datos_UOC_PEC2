Pole passed me a few hundred yards out.  When the pole was approximately 100 yds past me it stared going upstream.  I ran inside to get field glasses.  The pole stared an angle toward me.  My first observation was that it was rotating very fast.  The next thing I noticed was beyond my comprehension.  The best I can describe is to be compared to a candy stripe.  The stripe on the pole was not moving and i compare to a belt of water (irredesent).  The pole lifted with waves then i saw what ill call wings vibrating fast.  The wings looked like they were made of water. the wing were attached to the stripe.  I called for my wife to examine.  The rain blocked my vision.  I put this out of my mind never mentioned.  I saw them on the history channel 2012. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));30.4212;-86.8926
