5 light formation over Navarre sounds similar to other sighting;2005-11-07 18:00:00;5 minutes;5 light formation over Navarre sounds similar to other sighting I was at the light on the corner of Hwy 87 and Hwy 399, (also known as East Bay Blvd).  I looked up as I was pulling up to the light and saw 5 seperate lights shaped like a small, backwards letter d.   Four lights were in a square and the fifth was out in front on the left of the formation.   The lights were about 5 times larger than nearby stars, and absolutely stationary sitting at about one o'clock relative to me.  Just before the traffic light changed, the lighted object in front winked slightly as though the object might have begun spinning or spun slightly so that the light merely moved out of my field of view and then moved slowly forward.   I continued on to my house as other traffic was about, but looked and was unable to see the object at my house about 4.5 miles away.;30.4212;-86.8926
