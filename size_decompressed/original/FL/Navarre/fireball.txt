Orange Spheres Over Navarre/ Gulf Breeze, FL. Fade In and Out of Sight;2010-11-09 21:25:00;14 minutes;Orange Spheres Over Navarre/ Gulf Breeze, FL. Fade In and Out of Sight On November 9, 2010 between the time of 9:20pm and 9:34pm I was driving East down Highway 98 between Gulf Breeze, Florida and Navarre, Florida. Initially, I saw one orange light about 10-15miles ahead of me. The light was dim and in about 2 seconds it became brighter and larger. It looked like a ball of light or a flame but I mistook it for a low flying plane or cell phone tower light at first. However, about 2 minutes later the orange light appeared again, dim at first then becoming brighter. The light was larger than any of the stars in the sky and was slightly higher than 45 degrees from the position of my car. As I travelled east the orange light moved from the line of sight in front of my vehicle to the left side as if it was staying in one central location as I continued to move. I saw the same light fade in and out three times. At 9:31pm I called my boyfriend to tell him about the lights I was witnessing and was instructed to pull over to video tape the light. As I pulled off the road about a mile from the Navarre Beach Bridge I saw the light fade in and out again but this time I witnessed three other orange lights in the sky in a zigzag pattern downwards. At 9:34pm I waited with my digital camera to catch the orange lights again but after fifteen minutes of waiting nothing appeared in the sky.;30.4212;-86.8926

I was driving on HW 98 at 10:00 at night when I saw a orange/yellowish glowing fireball object passing through the sky over the sound.  It wasn't super high up and it was super lower when this happened.  The speed was pretty fast but not fast enough were I couldn't keep up with it but it was for sure moving at a good rate.  It never disappeared and as it flew over my car I then looked out my side mirrors to keep track of it. It moved from point A to point B very quickly.   I brought the object to my passengers attention as well and they were shocked! I told them I didn't see any flashing lights or anything that looked familiar like a plane.   They noticed the same thing I noticed. Like I said this object appeared as fireball with glow of orange and yellow.;30.4212;-86.8926
