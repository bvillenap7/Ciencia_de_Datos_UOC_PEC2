The lights were extremely bright, brighter than any star I have ever seen.  The five independent lights took the formation of a lower case d   I told my friend who was sitting in my truck to look at the lights, he got out and the lights were still there they were not moving at all.   Several other customers who were filling there cars with gas also saw the lights, then slowly one of the light started to move then another.  The second light that began to move started to get smaller till it no longer was visible.   At that time, to the lower left of the night sky a small red light showed up moving as if to intercept the lights, at that moment the remaining lights, literly took off at an enormous speed.;30.4212;-86.8926
5 bright lights in formation over florida;2005-11-07 18:25:00;about 5 min;5 bright lights in formation over florida I was out riding my bike with some friends, when up in the northeast sky we noticed a formation of 5 bright white lights.  So, we road our bikes down to the bay to get a clear view.  The formation hovered in the sky for about 5 minutes.  About 6 or 7 planes were seen flying around the formation.  After 5 minutes, the light on the far left started moving away from the formaion and slowly faded away.   Then one by one each light did the same thing.   When i first spotted the ufos, I called up another friend who was at his house and he witnessed the same thing, he happened to have a camera in his house so he ran inside, grabbed his cam, and began filming.  He caught like 3 min of it on film heres the link to the video  http://s13.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=3T04S0EMXTIO12ST8NKEX6GD4Z;30.4212;-86.8926
Formation of five bright amber lights held a hover in W formation over NW FL Mon 7 Nov 1840L;2005-11-07 18:40:00;10 mins;Formation of five bright amber lights held a hover in W formation over NW FL Mon 7 Nov 1840L (Addendum to earlier report) Witnessed a formation of very bright, amber-colored lights holding a W formation and hovering at steady altitude approx 15 miles distance, directly west of our location, angle of elevation approx 25 degrees from horizon.  I am a retired AF Special Ops aviator w/nearly 5,000 hours in a multitude of both fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft.  I've seen flares, SAM and air-to-air missile launches.  These lights were none of the above.  They held formation for approx 5 mins, then one by one, broke formation and disappeared w/in a few seconds of each other.  There were no milair in the area (Eglin Military Reservation) at the time of sighting (I checked w/base) but one small civilian plane did fly into the area during time of sighting.  It flew N to S, crossing in front of formation, then circled a 180 back N until it was clear of our view, then did a 360 before departing back to N.  We all felt the small plane was closer to us than the bright lights, since we could see it's red and green wing beacons and white anti-collision strobe.  The bright lights were evenly spaced and held perfectly still in the W formation for the five minutes I saw them.;30.4212;-86.8926
