On 10/15/15 at approximately 9:45 am, my son, age 14, and I age 42 were fishing on the Navarre Beach, FL, community pier facing west.  I'm not sure what caused me to look straight up in the sky, but when I did, I saw a diamond, or possibly oval, shaped object, dark colored making erratic movements.  It moved in straight lines at extremely fast speeds then would stop immediately making several zig zag type patterns before it disappeared.  It didn't fly very far.  It stayed mostly in the same area straight up in the sky.  I asked my son if he saw it.  He said he did and wondered if it could have been a bug.  We both looked back up and we saw it again making the same movements before it stopped and shot straight up making a slight curve as it disappeared.  We agreed that it could not have been a bug due to height at which it appeared to be and it made no sound.  The object was too far away to make out its shape.  There was very little wind, It was sunny and the sky was mostly clear.  There were no other aircraft in the sky at the time.  We have never witnessed a UFO before.  This object moved like no other aircraft I have ever seen even after spending 4 years in the U.S.A.F.;30.4212;-86.8926
