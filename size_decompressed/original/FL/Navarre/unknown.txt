large object with muliple lights moved impossibly and stood still  a skeptic until tonight;2006-07-18 00:15:00;still occuring;((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates flawed date.  Possible hoax, but we cannot be certain.  PD)) large object with muliple lights moved impossibly and stood still  a skeptic until tonight i must start by saying that i am the most skeptical person alive, until today about such matters it should also be noted that Navarre, Florida is near an Air Force Base....the object appears to be round and is in the far distance...has three lights, red, green, and bright clear light....sometimes merging and blinking....there is absolutely no question that is was beyond anything that i can logically explain.  the aircraft will stay still for long periods of time and then move precisely from side to side but only in short patterns and while the lights change.  It is just strange.  It seems impossible from what we know to be true about aviation, so thought i would write to this site annonimously about the incident...also, the distance of the object would seem to mean that it is very large.  For what it is worth....i am in shock concidering that i would never believe anything remotely similar could happen, but it just did.   Sincerly, a former unbeliver, skeptic.  Annoymous in Florida.
