Aqua blue lights in Maitland, Florida.;2013-03-01 08:30:00;6-8 seconds;aqua blue lights in maitland, florida I didnt want to write this, but on 03-01-13 on the corner of keller rd and maitland blvd in maitland, florida. i was leaving work at 8:25pm i seen a plane flying on my right side of my front windshield, then all of a sudden on my left side a ufo flys by me at amazing speed, it cross the my path of view from my car and headed towards the plane, the plane trys to vear off the the left but the ufo slows down and goes underneath the plane then shoots off into space. i'm sure others seen this, it happen so fast about 6 yo 8 seconds. im sure others seen this including the pilot. i could only see the lights, but i felt that the ufo was cloaked with the atmosphere, it didnt fly like a animal or plane, which uses the air to create lift. this thing seems to fly with no resistance to gravity, and it slice through the air as if it was nothing. i'm not making this up, i didnt want to actually go online about this, but my friends to me to report it. i don't have footage, ! i can only tell you what i saw.;28.6222380471379;-81.3654343434343
