We were cleaning fish that we had caught earlier in the day and suddenly we heard a low rummbling noise and we heard something scraping through the trees. It made quite a mess and initially I thought perhaps an air plane had crashed into the copse when suddenly at tree top level a vehicle emerged from the pines. It looked like a large cruise missle except it was wider and it had a black glass cab. It was blunt in the front and honestly it put in the mind of the space ships on the TV series Battle Star Galactica. Right down to the dirty white color of the fuselodge this craft with it's stunted wings and snub nose and its glistening black glass, hung in the air hovering, just over a palme tree that sat in my cousins side yard, in just the way that cruise missles don't. It hummed and the flash something seemed to explde from under the black cockpit glass and suddenly the thing was gone. A bright flash of blinding blue light the static smell of ozone and it was gone.;28.818588607595;-81.8736683544304

I was sitting out in the carport of my home one evening and was looking to the east just above the tree tops at the stars. Visibility was maximum, no clouds and low humidity. The craft appeared very faintly at first then became clearer as it drifted down and seem to hover. The craft had 9 red lights in an inverted chevron pattern which were faint at first then intensified and glowed. After hovering for approximently 10 seconds it began to fade then was gone. No sounds were detected. Ordinary person. 52YOWF-First and only sighting. (There were no other objects in the sky during this occurence except stars) ((NUFORC Note:  Please see report for 0031 hrs.

Space station or Space craft?;2010-12-09 21:00:00;2 hours;Space station or Space craft? So tonight I went out to smoke as usual and I always look at the stars since I was a kid, tonight when I looked up I seen a light with a tiny red tail. I rushed in to get my mother and she seen it went back inside, then I went back out to see if it was falling. I noticed it started to go back and forth side to side but it looked like only inch's where I was seeing it from. After that I seen it kinda light up and the red tail turned a green and there was what looked like a > math sign, greater than.  It turned from green to red, I only have one contact in but I watched with one eye. so I ran to get my sister and she saw it, went back in and I goggled it.  Said something about over breavard county Florida the space station could be seen but there was no date.  So I am wondering is it the space station a UFO, God?  I believe its still out there, its south south east, dropping below the tree lines, but it is still bright, soooo did I see one?;28.818588607595;-81.8736683544304
