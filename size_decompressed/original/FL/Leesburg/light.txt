7 white lights in formation travelling West to East in night sky.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-03-30 21:15:00;1 minute;7 white lights in formation travelling West to East in night sky. At 2115 hrs on 30 April 2020, I went outside to walk the dog and looked up to see seven lights travelling West to East (approximately) over Leesburg, Florida.  In the space of a minute they faded from sight to the East, in procession.  There may have been more before I looked up, as the farthermost light to the East was quick to disappear. The first six lights were in a line, the last was initially slightly behind and to one side, but by the time they disappeared it had caught up with the last light in line.  Their brightness was less than Venus but probably slightly brighter than Sirius.  It was not possible to assess the height or size of the UFOs;28.818588607595;-81.8736683544304
