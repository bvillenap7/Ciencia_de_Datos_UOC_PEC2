I stood and watched it come into view.  It looked dark, probably not dark gray, but more black, was triangular in shape with there being two projecting structures out the back area. I thought F-117 Nighthawk but then wondered could it have been an F-22 Raptor? It really didn't look exactly like those aircraft so I wondered maybe some new stealth aircraft. If not a stealth aircraft, unidentified flying object.  I didn't see a projecting front part of the aircraft like I see in the F-22. I didn't see any flashing lights. It had a sound that wasn't like a typical aircraft and it seemed to lumber across the sky .  I am in Leesburg, Florida where we have a lot of aircraft overhead every day. But, nothing like this!;28.818588607595;-81.8736683544304
