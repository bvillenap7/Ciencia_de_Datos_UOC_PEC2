PD));2018-06-29 06:00:00;~5 minutes;Bright light with vapor trails over Central Florida early am 06/29/18 Very bright light solid not pulsing like the airplanes in the sky.  Was flying on a perpendicular path to the Orlando flight path.  Smaller less intense light broke off and flew in a downward direction.  It left off-shaped vapor trails that were also bright not sure if it was from the sunrise hitting them or not but other clouds were not as bright.  Flew behind other clouds and was bright enough to still see.  Passed beyond my sight on the horizon in a couple minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch from Cape Kennedy at 05:57.

The top of the cloud was really bright so I thought I would take a picture of it. I actually took three pictures as the sun was going down and the colors were changing. After looking back at the pictures, I noticed an anomaly in the second picture that I didnâ€™t see when taking the shot.;28.818588607595;-81.8736683544304
