Orange glowing fireball in the sky in Leesburg, FL;2005-02-19 03:45:00;1 minute;Orange glowing fireball in the sky in Leesburg, FL Me and my mother witnessed this craft for a very brief period of time. It appeared to be a fireball in the sky, as we were driving North on hwy 44, going towards Eustis, I glimpsed over to the East of the Van, and witnessed this bright orange glow, it was way too big to be any typical aircraft, or an explosion. There was no sound, and I'm very sure that this was not a weather balloon, or anything of the sorts. I immediatly got my mothers attention, and she saw the same thing that I was seeing, so I'm very sure we weren't hallucinating.;28.818588607595;-81.8736683544304
strange leesburg aircraft? comet?;2006-06-13 22:00:00;few seconds;strange leesburg aircraft? comet? Well me and my friend were skating to his house and i seend something in the sky.It seemed like a comet cause it didnt seem to be moving wasnt a plane cause no light flashing and had a tail like trail like a comet.I told him to  look and it was gone.It left out of nowhere it was like it wasnt even there.Then on the way to his house on the trail he notices it! just sitting there not moving with the same light trail.I know it couldnt be a meteor cause they go really fast.If you have seen the Hailbop comet (think thats the name),thats exaclty what it looked like.Also again it was gone within a matter of seconds this time it stayed a little longer but was gone with the clouds.It wasnt a plane and im positive nor a meteor.Im certain this was some kind of aircraft not saying was a ufo,but if it was a plane it would have made some kind of noise it was plain silent and really close.There were tho an odd about of planes around the area tho as if they were checking out what this thing was!I hope someone else has seen it and will post about it here.Me and my friend are still wondering what it was.Maybe we will never know.;28.818588607595;-81.8736683544304
