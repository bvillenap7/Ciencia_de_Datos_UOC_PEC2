Instantly realizing the object was too large, and not placed where the planet usually is (lately).  I have lived in East Central Florida for 40 years and have seen hundreds of launches from Cape Canaveral.  Using those sights as a reference, I saw this object zoom into space at a speed very much faster than any spacecraft I've seen.;28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531

Eleven reddish orange lights appear and disappear in the skey;2002-02-02 21:15:00;2210;Eleven reddish orange lights appear and disappear in the skey On Saturday, February 2,2002 at approximately 9:15 p.m., my husbard and I were leaving my mothers house, she leaves in the Lake Washington area.  In the southwest sky my husband observed a reddish orange light.  The light appeared to be standing still.  Living near an airport we first thought it might be a incoming airplane.  We got out of the car and while waiting to see if the light would move all of a sudden a second but smaller light appeared above and to the right of the first light.  As we waited to see what would happen next the first light suddenly disappeared.  Then all of a sudden the light reappeared and then the second light disappeared.  I called my mother out and she brought with her a pair of binoculars.  When looking through the binoculars you could observe the lights pulsating.  The light would take turns suddenly appearing and disappearing. The lights would also change shapes. The continuded for about 40-45 minutes.  When all of a sudden one by one seven lights appeared.  Each light was even distanced except for the space between the 4 and 5 light.  After all seven lights appeared in a perfectly straight horizontal line, to the above and left 4 more lights appeared.  The next thing we heard was what eppeared to be two military jets and a Blackhawk helicopter.  There was also a plane with search lights that flew over the sightings area.  Upon the arrival of the aircraft all of the lights immediately disappeared.  My sister and her friend also observed the unusually busy night sky with the military aircraft. This entire episode lasted for about 50 minutes.  If I had not seen it with my own eyes, I would not have believe it.;28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531

What I thought was a star in the Northeast sky suddenly moved across (East) and then disappeared into the distance. There was not a cloud in the sky. There were 3 helicopters going by at the time and the difference in the type of light between the aircraft and what looked like a star was unmistakable.

I then looked up at the sky, I was facing east. I saw traveling from North to South what seemed to be 2 pretty big pinkish red round  lights  traveling. One was in front and the second one seemed to be following the first one. The second object was behind and to the right of the lead object. The were too low to be airplanes and made no sound at all. I clearly saw the two objects long enough to see that they were not everyday craft. They seemed to be exactly the same size and seemed to travel at the exact same speed. They flew into or behind a cloud and I lost sight of them. I continued to look to see if I could find where they went but to no avail. About 2 minutes after I saw these pinkish red lights that seemed to come from the north, I heard and saw an airplane fly in the same direction but the airplane turned to the east too soon to follow the path that these objects had taken. The objects were flying down here in our atmosphere, I mean to say, that they were not high in the sky. They were lower than a small airplane would fly...........;28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531
Pre dawn with clear moon lite sky, three bright lights appeared quickly and vanished just as quick, but all were of the same appearanc;2008-04-24 06:05:00;2-3 minuets;Pre dawn with clear moon lite sky, three bright lights appeared quickly and vanished just as quick, but all were of the same appearanc I am 58 years old. I am a retired US Army Sergeant First Class (E-7). I have been working with the Air Force Security Forces for ten years, as a civil service employee. My wife and I have lived in Florida for the past eleven years. I have three years of college. My signal corps background in the Army required me to maintain the highest level of secret clearances. I recruited for the Army in Colorado. I am a stable person in society.  I spotted three brillently lite lights, seperately but within seconds of each other, in the early morning hours of 24 April, 2008.  I was sitting out front having my morning coffee prior to leaving for work. Around 0610, I caught a glimpse of a bright light up around the nearly full moon and the star to its western side. This light lasted only a matter of one or two seconds and was traveling at a super rate of speed from south to north direction. It's altitude seemed to be either out in space or very near the earths upper most atmosphere.  The light/flash was so intense that I had to contemplate what it might be. It was definately not a commercial aircraft, it moved across the sky far to fast. I know what Navy and Air Force fighter aircraft look like in flight and these lights moved far faster than any aircraft in the fleet.  There was no noise prior to or after the sightings. There were no contrails, and the moon lite sky was for the most part clear.  I know what meteorites and space junk look like when they enter our atmosphere and burn up on entry. These did not burn up, they simply appeared out of nowhere and just as quickly disappeared.  These objects were brighter than any star that is visiable with the naked eye. They did not appear to be traveling a set path as would a satellite crossing over.  I considered the space station crossing over and getting the reflections from the sun rising. No way. It would be a single siting and be over with.  I witnessed these three lights on three seperate occations, only seconds apart. The first as mentioned above. The second followed up in the same path as the first, south to north, same exact location between the moon and a star just west of the moon.  The third appeared suddenly and traveled east of the moon on a westerly to easterly direction. It too, dissapeared quickly. You could count one thousand one, one thousand two and in this time period it covered a large area of space and sky prior to disappearing.;28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531

With girlfriend. It was 10:09 on my birthday and I was driving down Sarno road right next to Harbor Elementary.  I just picked up a pizza and was driving back to my place.  I was with my girlfriend almost home and I spotted something in the sky hovering less than a mile high up in the sky.  It looked like a dim yet bright lantern.   I pointed it to her and she started to freak out a little and was like wait...I think it's a remote plane and I was like...no way.  As we went under it and went out of our view, we looked around and saw cars slowing down to look at it.  After it got in to our view again (in my driver mirror) both my girl and I was looking at it and about ~5-7 seconds later it just shot up really freaking fast and just kept going up and went out of sight in about 7 seconds.  There wasn't a cloud in the sky.;28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531
Silent, pulsating orange light from south to north;2012-04-29 23:45:00;4 minutes;Silent, pulsating orange light from south to north An orange light came from the SSE and went NNW. I watched for the usual red and green lights but none ever appeared.  Then the light went brighter, then dimmer, and then lighter again as it traveled across the sky.  There was a center mass but no vehicle discernable. Again, no red or green lights, or white headlight as usually seen on a plane. When it went overhead there was no sound, coming or going.  Then it disappeared. I’ve seen satellites over the years and they are always white and much higher in the sky. It wasn’t a meteorite for there was no tail and no sound for how low it was.;28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531

It was north of me, moving north in a small, zigzag pattern.  It was pulsating brighter, then fainter, but always visible.  There were no other usual aircraft green, red, white lights and no sound.  There appeared to be a slight haze around it and I could not make out an actual, physical object.   I watched for a minute when it just  went faint, then disappeared. It was the same kind of orange light I saw a year ago April for two consecutive  nights.;28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531

We stayed alongside the Atlantic ocean and stayed up one night until about 4:00am.  We were sitting in front of the ocean admiring the stars and out in the distance we saw a round ball of whitish yellow light darting across the sky.   At first we thought it was a star but it cut across the sky unlike anything we've seen before.   We watched it for what felt about like 3 to 5 minutes.   My boyfriend tried to get a pic finally and accidentally let it flash, lighting up the whole beach.   After the flash of the pic we looked back it had already disappeared into the stars.

Two orange lights hovering above ocean at night.  ((anonymous report));2017-03-09 01:00:00;10 minutes;Two orange lights hovering above ocean at night Two orange lights appeared out of nowhere and stayed in the same position, hovering above the ocean at Melbourne Beach.  5 nerdy engineering students, who don't drink or do drugs, spotted the lights.  One light appeared before the other and disappeared, before the other, too.  Lights were very bright, illuminated beach, could see shells and look through bag with ease.  Very small lights, seemed to be very far out in ocean, had faint cone of light around each light. Were probably not flares because they did not rise or fall at all.  There were others at the beach that probably saw the lights, too. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
