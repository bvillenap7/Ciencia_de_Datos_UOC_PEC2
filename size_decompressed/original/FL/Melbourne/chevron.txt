July 7,2001 945 pm, I observed a UFO and filed a report Aug 8,2001 .I reported a (V) shaped UFO, which was missing two lights on one end, while in Melborne Florida. (see original report for more info). Today, Aug 20,2002, I was checking your website and observed a report and drawing of a UFO reported 7-23-2002, in Valencia,California.  This drawing is the same shape craft that I saw, except for the color of the lights.  My wife and kids make fun of me all the time for the report that I made to your website.  This report and drawing sure make me feel better for filing my report! Thank you for all your hard work!;28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531
V shape craft in Central FL;2010-12-01 21:15:00;5 secs.;V shape craft in Central FL V shape (same as famous Arizona sighting) with 5 circular lights under. Kind of invisible until it goes into a low cloud that you can see the craft shape moved from East to NW. Actually we have seen the same craft at the same location 2 years ago (April) with better view, a lot closer, but were unsure about reporting. After last night it is clear to be a regular path. Incredible!;28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531
