My wife and I were driving south on Wickham road when a large white sphere shot across the sky it was going west parallel with the ground and appeared to cross the road about 7 to 10 miles in front of us the sphere didn't look to be very high in the sky less then 300 feet but was difficult to judge at night as you couldn't see a landmark to try and get a bearing on it. The craft then took a 90 degree turn straight down toward the ground and disappeared. From where we were it looked like it would have hit the ground in West Melbourne or Palm Bay. The entire event didn't last 5 seconds. From that far away it still looked to be a pretty big craft not 100 feet across but bigger than a helicopter. What made us think it was a ufo was the 90 degree turn at very high speed not that far off the ground I was expecting to see the ground light up from the crash but nothing happened. If you want to contact me send an Email with a phone number and evening time to call you.;28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531
Metallic Spherical Object spotted at 3000-3500ft by Melbourne / East Coast 20-30nm south of the Space Station. in a PA28 at 4500ft;2007-02-28 15:30:00;10 seconds;Metallic Spherical Object spotted at 3000-3500ft by Melbourne/East Coast 20-30nm south of the Space Station. in a PA28 at 4500ft Hi there, I'm a pilot from the vero beach area and was on a cross country flight from vero beach to Ocala, took off round 2:30p.m Local and climbed to my cruise altitude of 4500feet in a PA-28.  About 10 miles north of the Melbourne VOR and on the 343degree radial northbound, I witnessed a metallic spherical object 500-1000ft below me to my 11 oclock.  The object appeared to be about 3-5m minimum in diameter, could have been bigger, and was completely shiny with nothing interms of design or edges, a pure metallic sphere and passed over onto my wing side where i saw it, was about 500-1000 ft from me, and like i said about 500 ft to 1000 ft below the horizon and I can definitely see it in contrast to the green background of the ground.  It may have been hovering or traveling at a very slow speed.  With the sun reflecting the front portion of the sphere, I can literally focus on the rear and from there I followed it and made sure it was in fact a sphere and shiny metallic surface.   I was filing a flight plan with St. Petersbrgh Flight Service Station at the same time and was interrupted by the sighting and I filed the report instantly and in the same conversation as with the filing of the plan with no pauses with the station.  Until now, no news on what it may have been but i was told information was sent to nasa.... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Three orange lights on top and four yellow lights on the bottom. Shaped like an oval or sphere.;2010-02-13 19:15:00;1 MINUTE;Three orange lights on top and four yellow lights on the bottom. Shaped like an oval or sphere. I was out on the patio in my backyard at about 7:15 pm (EST) when I noticed a very strange accumulation of lights. It was still. No movement was made for at least one minute. There were four yellow lights (I thought it was a cluster of stars I'd never seen before) very close together and just above them were three orange(?)lights, one was above and between the 1st and second yellow lights,the 2nd orange light was above and between the second and third yellowlights and the third orange light was above and between the third and fourth yellow lights. I stared at this for a minute or so and thought it was very odd. Then, the entire object swiftly moved across the sky with no real direction. I followed it's course for about 20 seconds as it moved over the roof of a house and I could  no longer follow it. It was nothing like I've ever seen before.;28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531

As we got closer they disappeared one by one until only a single light remained. Trying to get a closer look i turned down florida ave and as i completed the turn the last orb vanished. We couldnt get a clear photo before they were gone. Many others drivinv down the road slowed and stared at the lights. Im convinced more people saw it. Hopefully they report as well.;28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531
