Triangle Shaped Craft;2008-09-15 20:03:00;2 Minutes;Triangle Shaped Craft While driving to my friends house to hang out I came accross 3 bright lights and one really bright red pulsating light. Each bright light was located at every end of the triangle. Interested in what I was looking at I decided to drive closer to the object to get a better look. I was able to get right under the craft and get a pretty good view of it. I was about 300 FT from the ground, and was moving at a very slow and steady speed. I got out of my car to get a better view and noticed that it was making no sounds. It was heading west onto I 95. I would have loved to have some evidence but the only thing on me at the time was a cell phone, and all that appeared on camera was a bright red light.;28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531

It was triangular in shape and moved at a steady pace across the sky.  All I could see was three dim points in a perfect triangle flying with the point facing the rear.  I am not sure if this was one craft or possibly 3 flying in formation. No other meteors were seen, although I try to catch every meteor shower.  I have seen my fair share of meteors and never have I seen anything like this.  I want to say that the three points were kind of reddish in color, they were not lit up like a light, but were still distinguishable in the night sky.

Triangular objects over Melbourne, FL;2020-12-10 20:05:00;&lt1 minute;Triangular objects over Melbourne, FL My husband and I pulled into the parking lot of a business in Melbourne, right off of US 1, to watch the Spacex launch on Thursday, Dec 10th. The launch was scheduled at 20:09 that evening, and we pulled off about 19:55 to catch it. We walked to the fence behind the building to get a better line of sight. As we were standing there, I looked up into the sky directly above and caught a glimpse of a triangular shaped object flying above us. All I could make out was the shape and that there was something on the perimeter of the object that may have been lights, but they were not on. As I was trying to point it out to my husband (who never saw the object) a second and then a third object followed the first one. They were traveling very fast and disappeared quickly to the south. Because of the conditions (it was nighttime, the sky and the objects were black) I can’t estimate the altitude of the objects, but they appeared large enough that my guess is they weren’t ! at significantly high altitude.;28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531
