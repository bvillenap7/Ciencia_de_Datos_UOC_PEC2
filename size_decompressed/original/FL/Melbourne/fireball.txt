Strange fireball;2012-03-01 18:45:00;30 seconds;Strange fireball. I noticed what seemed like a fireball streak from right to left with a very slight downward angle, but did not continue to fall to earth and there was no trace of light thereafter.  Living near an Air Force Base and local airport I have observed many different variations of aircraft, close enough to Cape Canaveral to witness launches of all kinds and have not ever noticed such a strange occurrence before.  I was standing just inside my screened in porch and stepped outside immediately.  It was very bright - very reddish/orange and very large.  It disappeared within 30 seconds roughly.  Not a meteor and night sky was as it should be.  It ALMOST looked like a burning plane but just stopped!;28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531

Orange spheres and slow moving stars.;2012-12-18 18:45:00;20 seconds;Orange spheres and slow moving stars. My grandma and my moms husband saw what they described as 3 orange spheres flying not that high over the Melbourne causeway.  I have 2 coworkers that have seen the same thing.  I never told them what my grandma saw till they told me what they saw so I know they are not making it up to jive me.  BTW both coworkers saw the orange spheres on different occasions both over the Indian river while crossing the causeway.  I listen to coast to coast and I notice them talking about the red fireballs over Florida and other parts of the country I'm convinced its the same phenomenon. I've never seen them personally but I have seen stars that move in the sky.  I can tell the difference between airplanes and UFOs because airplanes have some light blinking on them.  UFOs traditionally don't.  These things look exactly like stars and move in str8 lines and sometimes make sharp turns. Iv never seen them shoot off or anything, so I could be seein satellites.  They appear everyday I wo! rk at Patrick Air Force base at the chow hall and rite when the stars come out if you look up for a good 10 mins you'll start to notice it. I've shown other coworkers so this is not my eyes playing tricks. I see these star UFOs whenever I look up long enough at night time although I haven't been looking since early January. The orange spheres were 3 different occasions. This is not a joke I take this very seriously. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531
