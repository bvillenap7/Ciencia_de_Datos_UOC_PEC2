Craft observed to emerge from vanishing point of meteor;2004-05-27 21:50:00;5 minutes;Craft observed to emerge from vanishing point of meteor I was coming home from teaching out at one of the local community colleges(I teach an evening Intro to Sociology class...we get out at 9:40pm), and was heading north on I-95.  I had gotten to the exit that goes to the Beeline Expressway(Hwy 528), and was in the left lane, since I don't take that route. Looking straight ahead, at about mid-level in relation to my windshield, I saw a shooting star - a meteor - which, in and of itself, isn't unusual. However, this one was fat...the tail was thick in width, and the size change from end to end was not very extreme. Well, it dropped from about midway in my windshield field of vision, to just above the horizon, then vanished.  And now comes the weird part.  I was still looking in its direction, still north on I-95, though I had pulled off the highway to watch. Right at the lowest point where the meteor vanished, at exactly that point, something else began to come into view. Not a sudden appearance, like poof there it is...but a gradual visibility, taking about 5 seconds to come fully in sight, though it didn't grow in size(as an oncoming headlight, or light source, might do). What it seemed to be was a craft, oblong/oval in shape, no blinking lights, but it was illuminated...a dull glow, as opposed to brightly lit. Once it was fully visible, it sat in that spot for a couple of seconds, then proceeded to move in a westerly direction, the quality of the illumination never changing. There were no blinking lights at any time during this observation. I pulled back out on the highway, and watched it until I could no longer see it. It was on a westerly path the whole time, which lasted about 5 minutes.;28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531
