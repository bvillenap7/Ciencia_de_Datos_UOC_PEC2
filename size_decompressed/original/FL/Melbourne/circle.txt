Green zig zagging light;2012-04-16 22:04:00;2 minutes;Green zig zagging light I and a friend of mine were sitting on my back patio.  We both looked at the stars a lot and we both noticed a large green light in the sky.  As we watched it for a while, it looked like it was falling, but then it went up and started zig zagging side ways very fast.  Then it disappeared. It was a clear night.;28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531

What amazed me was it went from one side of the sky to the other in about 12 seconds and then suddenly disappeared.  It was very high in the sky and moved at a rate of speed I've never witnessed before.   At first I thought it was a falling star but it went directly horizontal across the sky.  I've checked news reports to see if anyone else saw it, but haven't seen any other reports..  I've timed all other aircraft's in the sky and nothing comes close to what I saw.  I say about 12 seconds because after watching for about 3 seconds, I started counting- because the rate of speed was phenomenal.  It did not have a tail, it was a yellowish round ball that moved from one side of the horizon to the other but seemed to disappear when it got over open water.  I'm hoping someone else saw it and will come forward.  I travel for my job and spend a lot of time on the road and this is the first time I cannot decipher what I witnessed.

Observed a black round or saucer shaped object traveling from south to north, then making a 90 degree turn west.;2015-06-26 14:30:00;4 minutes;June 26, 2015, 14:30 pm.   Observed a black round or saucer shaped object traveling from south to north, then making a 90 degree turn west. Looking out my bedroom window which faces south I observed a round or saucer shaped object traveling north toward the building I live in.  It made an immediate turn west and continued.   The object was black.  I did not observe any windows or markings on the craft.  I was inside the building so I did not hear any noise.  I live on the 11th floor of a high-rise.  Therefore, I could not hear a noise.  The altitude of this object did not seem that high from my observation point.   I went into my living room which faces due west and observed the object fade into the horizon.  I could visualize this object for a far greater distance than I can see a plane.;28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531
