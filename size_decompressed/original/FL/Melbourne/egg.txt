UFO on fire.;2018-01-19 20:00:00;5 minutes;UFO on fire Saw ufo on the way home from Orlando to Melbourne, Florida, on highway 95.  On the left-hand side, there was something on fire in the sky.  I thought it was a meteor or space junk, until it dropped and stopped.  It disappeared then it re-appeared probably a couple hundred feet above the ground.  It flashed.  It looked like there were light beams coming out of the side of it. It was also smoky around it.  It was probably an egg shape and white ish with a red/orange/yellow light surrounding it.  It then vanished and re appeared 3 times until it completely vanished.  Then further down the road there was this giant triangle in the sky. 3 light very bright.  One vanished and the other was flashing (not an airplane or helicopter) then suddenly this one appears that is low that is 3 lights on top and 3 lights on bottom on red and green and it was just flying around.  I was trying to take a photo/video and my phone was malfunctioning.  I called my mom and was freaking out about it to her on the phone.  It was crazy.;28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531
