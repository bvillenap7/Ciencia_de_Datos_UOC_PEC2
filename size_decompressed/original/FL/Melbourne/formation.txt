July 7, 2001, at aprox 945pm, my brother in law and I were standing on the beach in Melborne Florida on vacation.  The sky was clear and you could see a lot of stars.  My brother in law pointed to the sky and said what is that.  I looked to the sky and saw a (V) formation of six or seven white lights that almost looked like shooting stars but slower. The (V) formation was missing two lights on one end to make a perfect (V).  The formation looked a little blurry to me. The formation moved from the ocean side (South) to the north, high in the sky, maybe out of the atmosphere. The formation moved very fast lasting about three seconds.  Iam a Vietnam veteran and retired Police Officer.  I have lived near a military air base most of my life.  I have Never seen anything like this in my life!  About 11pm I called the Patrick Air Force base, which is near by, and spoke to the operator at the base.  I told her what I saw and asked her who I could talk to about what I saw.  She advised me that the Air Base did not investigate UFO sightings and advised me to call the Sheriffs office, which I did.  After telling the dispatcher what we saw, she said she had no other reports of what I saw and asked if I wanted to see a Police Officer and I stated no.  At aprox 3am I could not sleep thinking about what I saw and called the Sheriffs dispatcher again.  This time I talked to a male operator.  I asked him if he had any reports of strange lights and he stated oh yes lots of reports!  I told him what I saw and he had a quick change of attitude and asked if I had been drinking?  I told him no.  He said what you saw were fireworks and asked if I wanted him to send a Police Officer and I said no . I hope some eone else saw what we saw!;28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531
