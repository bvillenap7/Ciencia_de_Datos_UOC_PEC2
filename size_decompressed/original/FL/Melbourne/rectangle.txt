It was a very smooth and fast movement I followed the object and stayed in eye contact for 2-3 minutes. I rushed home to take a picture and look into object with binocular, but buy the time I turned into my block it was gone and disappeared so quickly before my eyes.;28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531

As;2020-01-29 09:07:00;30 seconds;I was driving northbound on I-95 around 9:00 am when I noticed an accident in the opposite southbound lane with traffic building up.  As my northbound traffic began to slow down for caution, I looked in the northeast sky over Melbourne, FL, and saw a rectangular shaped glowing object in the sky.  The object either appear to be emitting an orange glow or was reflecting the rising sun.  It appeared to me as a vertical rectangle which was wider at the top than the bottom.  The top of the rectangle appeared to have some sort of crests or wings arched out of the rear.  I diverted vision from the object to open my phone camera and lost sight of the object and could not relocate.;28.1088315494928;-80.6707857642531
