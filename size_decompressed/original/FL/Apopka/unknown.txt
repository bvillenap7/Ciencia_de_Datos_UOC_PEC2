Satelites that move back and forth and in circles?? I dont think so!;2002-11-19 05:00:00;2 hours;Satelites that move back and forth and in circles?? I dont think so! I was watching the metor shower and then we saw some passing satelites then we saw what looked like a satelite or a moving star change direction. Then the moving starlike object stopped and moved around in the sky in circles and back and fourth motions. It was too far in the sky to see any detail, it just looked like a moving star. It stayed up in the sky until daybreak then I lost sight of it.;28.6607570702792;-81.4930654530068
