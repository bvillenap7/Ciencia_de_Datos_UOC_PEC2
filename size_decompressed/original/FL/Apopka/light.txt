Or if someone threw a basket ball at it. Dh & I look at eachother and say what was that?! I put the light on and see nothing. Open the door and find nothing. Thought about this later and related this sound to a sonic boom, which we are familiar with here in Florida.  ~ Go outside on my back patio around 9:45 and see a bright light in the dark sky. I first just assumed it was like a transformer blowing or lightning but it was a constant light--not up in the sky though low to the ground. Not like the flashes transformers or lightning typically causes. It stayed lit up for about 3-5 minutes. The night was also a clear night.  ~ Hearing something up on my roof like running back and forth. Initially I thought squirrels but these squirrels would have to be hmmmm...20-30lbs to make that kind of ruckus. No kidding it sounds like a child running up on the roof.  ~ So, I go out for the day today. I am pulling out of my neighborhood and see a street sign knocked down about a block away. It isn't bent down more like sawed down.  ~ Turn out of subdivision and head down fairly busy street. Notice on the left side of the road all traffic signs are bent slightly to the left almost exactly the same. I am talking speed limit signs, H (Hospital) signs, school zone signs, etc. They are all bent like this for approx. 1 mile.??  ~ I have a bruise on my arm that I don't know where it came from and is in a conspicious area that I racked my brain trying to understand what happened. Met up with my brother and he has the same bruise (size & shape of the letter U) that he doesn't know where he got it either. For the record I didn't mention my bruise to him or any of my other weird coincidences that have been going on. However, I did mention it to him later.;28.6607570702792;-81.4930654530068
two bright lights flying over apopka;2009-11-13 20:15:00;10-15 seconds;two bright lights flying over apopka Driving down 441 from Orlando towards Apopka, just past Wekiva Springs Road intersection. Sky was very clear, usual air traffic (there's a small airpirt in Apopka, Orlando International and now Sanford Intertnational, so we're used to plenty of planes in the sky). Stars were also clear. As I passed Wekiva Springs Road intersection, I noticed two very bright lights in the sky. My immediate thought was two abnormally bright stars, but they were moving towards me, so I assumed jet plane. Then I realized how big (wide) this plane had to have been, and there were no blinking lights or red/green lights. Only two bright white lights. It seemed to be descending, which I thought was odd, and then it started to bank hard left. My heart dropped, because I thought for sure this huge plane was about to crash land. But then I realized it stayed in the same path. Then it changed directions and banked hard right, also staying on same path. That's when it started looking like two lights rather than one object. It then spun in a complete circle while still traveling and descending, and that's when I lost it/them behind the treeline. I looked to my right to see if any other drivers had seen, but they were distracted on their cell phones. I rushed home, my husband was outside, and I asked him if he heard or saw anything, but he did not. It's still difficult to tell if it was one large plane with two bright lights on each wing or two separate light spheres that were flying in some sort of formation together. All I know is that it was no ordinary plane, and they were not stars. I thought the other planes would have seen them for sure... but I haven't seen any other reports yet. This is my first time looking, though... still new to me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));28.6607570702792;-81.4930654530068

Tons of lights in the sky, video proof.;2014-05-25 00:00:00;3 minutes;Tons of lights in the sky, video proof. I was leaving my friends house and saw these orange lights in the sky, so I pulled over and video taped them, I thought it to be just a meteor shower but people are telling me that that is not what a shower looks like. I have seen a ufo before up close and it was amazing, but this time there were so many of them, I hope they weren't just meteorites, id feel bad for wasting your time, but I just feel the need to be vigilant... I seemed to me they would fade out once they noticed i was looking at them... Again just freaked out, if there is a reasonable explanation id love to hear it...

Floating light with cone followed by low bass rumbling sound with a different light.;2016-07-14 01:50:00;2-5 minutes;Floating light with cone followed by low bass rumbling sound with a different light. I was in the neighborhood, hanging out late night with a friend.  We were sitting at a bench in the neighborhood.  I walked towards his car, when I noticed a light about 350-400 feet in the air above the tree line to the East.  It looked like a star.  Sort of yellow.  From the yellow light was this funnel of light (sort of a cone) that was a sort of orange brown extending at a 5 o clock direction from the light.  Inside the cone were three blinking white lights that alternated randomly.  The blinking lights were spaced out evenly long ways inside the cone.  My friend and I were perplexed, staring at this light, because we'd never seen something airborne act in that sort of fashion.   After staring at the light for what seemed like 2 minutes (it could have been longer) the blinking dots stopped.  Then the cone started to slightly disappear.  Once it was gone, the light began to also fade away. Also forgot to mention that I was a sort of thin smoke pillar extend from the bottom of the cone to about halfway to the ground.  Never touching the ground.  Or even reaching the trees.  The smoke went away first, then the cone, then the light. After that about 1 minute later, I heard and felt a low low rumble.  Like very distant boulders falling from a cliff.  And then over the course of the next 30 seconds the rumble grew louder and more intense.  Parallel to the sound was a light eminating from past the tree line.  I could see the atmosphere grow with light.  I felt as though a nuclear bomb had dropped and the blast wave was imminent.  The low hum/rumble was extremely frightening. I honestly thought I was going to die.  After 30 seconds the sound stopped instantly.  And the light faded. Something else to mention,  I don't know if this is relevant, but there's a retention pond in the neighborhood.  Inside the pond were frogs.  Immediately after the rumbling light, the frogs all started to yip and make noise as a group.  That lasted for another minute or two.;28.6607570702792;-81.4930654530068
Red and green flashing orb above tree line followed by bizarre humming noise and overwhelming fear.;2016-07-14 02:00:00;10 minutes;Red and green flashing orb above tree line followed by bizarre humming noise and overwhelming fear. I walked outside to get my cigarettes from my car, when suddenly, I felt a strange feeling.  I looked up and just beside the trees was a red and green flashing light, moving erratically in a zig-zag fashion, only to stop and hover for some time, leading me to conclude it was not a plane and could not be a star due to it's various flashing colors.   A hazy beam of light could then be seen emanating from it as if searching for something.   I stood there for nearly 10 minutes until I heard a dull humming noise coming from the direction of the UFO.  I felt suddenly overwhelmed with fear and ran back inside.;28.6607570702792;-81.4930654530068
