No airplane were in sky at the time then noticed a plane to my far left out of corner of my eye and the lights I was watching completely disappeared and was not seen again once actual airplane was noticed me and 3 others watched them one of the guys has some video of the event not sure if it turned out did not get to see it we returned to our job and we told 2 others about the event and they thought we were crazy of course I have never seen anything like these that traveled so fast apart and then back again so fast still don't understand what they were;28.6607570702792;-81.4930654530068
