Silver object darting in and out of dark cloud between Orlando and Tampa.;2008-07-13 14:00:00;1 minute;Silver object darting in and out of dark cloud between Orlando and Tampa. Time was approximate, at 14:00 I was in break room at work looking towards south /southwest. Clouds were becoming very dark.  Approximately 40 miles away, I saw an object that was silver or white darting in and out of dark cloud traveling in circles or figure eights. At first suspected Flying Angels from MacDill AFB  but I do not think military would have any craft doing tricks in and out of a very dark storm cloud. I can honestly say this is the first time I have ever seen anything that warrants making this type of report.;28.6607570702792;-81.4930654530068
Bright orange oval like object . Unexplained movement pattern.  Disappeared like the space shuttle.;2009-07-04 22:00:00;5 minutes;Bright orange oval like object. Unexplained movement pattern.  Disappeared like the space shuttle. Bright orange object moving slowly towards us, then paused moved to the right, then begin to move straight up to the sky and slowly dimmed out into space as the shuttle has when it has been launched at night. At roughly 10:48 p.m. last night July 4th 2009. My family and I were standing outsied after we had finished up a few fireworks.  I was getting ready to leave when a family member looked up and said what's that? I looked up and at first thought it was trick someone was playing to try and freak out people during the 4th.  However it's movement was so odd that I called 5 other family members and said look! We a looked up and saw this object. It then started moving towards the right and then speed up just a bit and moved up. It disappeared up into space as it does when I have seen the space shuttle. When it was almost out of few completely it almost flickered like a twinkling star and then it was gone. I'm not a believer in this sort of UFO stuff at all. However, this was something strange. I have tried to find any toys online that would cause something like this but I failed to find anything. If anyone can explain this it would be great. Also there was no noise at all. it was just there. Conditions were completely clear while viewing it. The sky was clear and this was not a firework of any kind.
