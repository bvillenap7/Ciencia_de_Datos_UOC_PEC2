Routine sightings of round,lumenescent orb over the night sky in Apopka, Altamonte Springs FL...flies very fast ,fairly regularly.;2000-07-15 22:30:00;less than 1 sec;Routine sightings of round,lumenescent orb over the night sky in Apopka, Altamonte Springs FL...flies very fast ,fairly regularly. We have seen this specific lumenescent sphere many many times since we have lived here, its usually white,or blueish white, a round shape, lumenescent, travels extremely fast, across the night sky,in pathways, that are low to the ground, its been seen around here by other neighbors, it can hover over trees, and stand still, it is usually seen by myself, and husband or friends, we have seen this same object probably 10x in the last 2 yrs here. We also have seen the Cape Canaveral launches,and falling space debris, we kind of know what we are looking at, but this orb is so fast its almost quicker than the eye, as soon as you see it ,its gone across the sky...its fairly regular, and takes a couple of different pathways, we usualy see it between 10pm and 1100 at night...its fairly consistent around here.... maybe folks should start  studying the night sky around Apopka and Altamonte springs, FLorida...for some interesting UFO studies....its happening with such regularity, I have been thinking of getting a video tape and recording the sky, and doing my own home grown UFO research...very interesting phenomenon...what do you think it iS? ((NUFORC Note:  We assume the witness implies a date in the year 2000.));28.6607570702792;-81.4930654530068
Bright flashing light high in the sky moving fast;2003-01-30 21:25:00;6 minutes;Bright flashing light high in the sky moving fast We were outside taping random items at dark when a plane went overhead so we taped it. While looking in the sky I saw a white light flashing up really high in the sky, I thought it was a star at first. Then it started moving across the sky, within a few minutes it was on the other side of the sky, looking like it was about to circle us. It hovered and then zoomed off at the very beginning. The light would flash, we didn't see it for a few seconds and then it would come back. There was no noise at all. We have a few seconds of it on tape, when we could catch it.;28.6607570702792;-81.4930654530068
Orange orb over the skys of Apopka.;2014-03-31 22:40:00;30 seconds;orange orb over the skys of apopka I was smoking a cigarette in the back yard while letting my dogs go to the bathroom.  I noticed mt dogs had all stopped running around and were sniffing at the sky , as though they were trying to scent something.  I started looking at the sky through the trees in the direction they were looking and I saw an object moving about as fast as a jet.  It seemed to be a normal occurrence but the color was off, it didn't have the normal hue of lights a plane or helicopter would have, no red or blue flashing lights, and there wasn't a tail so it didn't appear to be a meteor or falling star.   I ran inside my house to grab my phone, I figured the rate of speed it was moving I'd have plenty of time to get some footage.  I couldn't have been more than 5-10 seconds and I went out my front door for a better angle.  I know my timing was accurate, it had only crossed the back left corner of my back yard, it should have been in view but it seemingly disappeared.  No idea what it could've been, but I believe I definitely saw something unusual tonight.   As a fire control technician in the navy's submarine force, I was trained in celestial navigation and had extensive training in identifying aircraft from a distance.  This was no normal aircraft.  Possibly a rocket or missile but again, there was no flame or tail.  Just an orange orb traveling in a straight line across the sky.;28.6607570702792;-81.4930654530068
