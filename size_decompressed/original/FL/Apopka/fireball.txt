8-10 Orange Orbs observed by 8 witnesses and later 2 black helicopters arrive;2012-05-06 21:00:00;30 minutes;8-10 Orange Orbs observed by 8 witnesses and later 2 black helicopters arrive May 6, 2012:  APPROXIMATELY  8-10  ORANGE ORBS AND 2 BLACK HELICOPTERS  	On Saturday, May 6, from approximately 9-9:20 pm, I and about 6 other witnesses saw approximately 8-10 orange orbs in Apopka, Florida.  The witnesses were myself, my wife’s brother, my wife’s father, 2 other adults, and a teenager. We were attending the high school graduating ceremony of my wife’s nephew who was graduating from Forest Lake Academy in Apopka, Florida.  The lengthy graduation ceremony was almost finishing and I wanted to get some air and stepped outside of the auditorium.  We were located on a small hill about 300 feet north of state road 436 just west of state road 434.  Thus, the orbs were very close, about 300 feet away, and the visibility was excellent. All of the witnesses began to see bright yellow orbs rising from approximately the interchange of road 436 and 434 from about tree level.  We could not see them coming from the ground but appeared to “pop out” at the tree level.  They appeared to travel in a westerly direction along road 436 just south of it.  The orbs appeared about every 1-2 minutes.   Most were uniform in direction and most went west and upwards slowly, I would guess at 10-20 mph.  Some began to float straight up and others moved faster (30-40 mph) than others. The orbs then became distant and disappeared.  This lasted from approximately 9 pm to about 9:20 pm.  About 10 minutes later, two black helicopters came zooming in at a fast rate.  They stopped on top of route 436 just south of Bear Lake Road (about ½ mile from where we were).  They stayed there about 10-15 minutes and then left.  The orbs had disappeared when they arrived. Orb description:  Difficult to describe but they appeared to be the size of a small Volkswagen in the air.  They were round in shape, bright orange color.  Light was self contained in object and not emitted outwards.  I thought they might have been Chinese lanterns but I have never seen a Chinese lantern before.  But now after all of our recent sightings, I am having a second opinion. Attached is a map of Forest Lake Academy and location of Orb movements.;28.6607570702792;-81.4930654530068
7 Fireballs in Apopka sky;2012-08-09 20:48:00;5 minutes;7 Fireballs in Apopka sky The objects were bright orange fireballs that were moving through the sky.  They formed what looked like the constellation of the big dipper for a short period before breaking into yet another form where 3 of them made a distinct triangle apart from the others.  I was driving and turned away from them to go down another road to get to store.  When I got back to intersection about 4 minutes later, I saw only one fireball left in the sky and watched it float north in the sky for about 20 more seconds before driving off away from it. Never have I witnessed anything in the sky like this before.;28.6607570702792;-81.4930654530068
