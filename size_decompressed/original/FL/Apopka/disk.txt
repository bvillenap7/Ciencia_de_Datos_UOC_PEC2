Green lit object with a red light spinning around object in late night sky;2013-05-26 00:15:00;15 minutes;Green  lit object with a red light spinning around object in late night sky I stepped outside on to my back patio last night at 12:15am (0:15).  I looked south out over my pool and up in the sky was an object hovering around.  There were green lights constantly on and a red light that appeared to go counter clockwise around from beneath the object. I watched for about a minute in amazement as how it randomly moved around the sky. It then started coming my direction, and in the moment, I felt a little scared.  I ran in the house and woke my girlfriend up and said, You have to come see this or you are going to think I am crazy in the morning. On the way back outside, I grabbed my new Samsung ATIV tablet to video it.  The object had gone further out in the distance but I was still able to get about four minutes of video.  The red lights were not as visible on the footage as they were to the human eye. We both watched as continued to move around the sky in the strangest way.   This went on for about ten to fifteen minutes. I have never been a believer, always a bit of a skeptic, until last night.;28.6607570702792;-81.4930654530068
