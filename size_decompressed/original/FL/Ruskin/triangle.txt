Very silent, until it started moving.  Made loud humming sound. Object hovered over field without ever moving for 8-9 minutes. Then slowy flew over our home. When we looked up we seen a triangle with a what appeared to be an airplane under it.  I work with planes and never seen anything like this.  It was heading in the direction as McDill Airforce Base.   It's my opinion that whatever it was, it wanted us to think it was a plane.
