Four fireball looking objects moving across the sky;2012-12-24 22:15:00;3;four fireball looking objects moving across the sky I stepped out the front door of my house with my husband and 2 children when I spotted 3 red, flickering lights spaced apart and moving north across the sky.  Then a fourth one appeared behind the 3.  They seem to have been following the same flight path.  They looked like a fireball and made no sound at all.  They simply disappeared one by one into the clouds.;27.7044999999999;-82.4337999999997
