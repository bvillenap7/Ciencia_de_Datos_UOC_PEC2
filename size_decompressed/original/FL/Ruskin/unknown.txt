I finally saw something in a pitch black sky that made the wife and me both say, What the hell did we just see? 	 								  Coming into sight over the tree line, heading due west, in a dark sky (about 9:15 pm, Monday July 14th), with no other cars in sight, was a bright light looking like it might have been a plane heading for the air force base.   We were traveling North on hwy 41, between Palmetto, Fl, and Ruskin, Fl.  Being the only lit object in sight, about 1 mile up, we were both looking right at the light, when it changed direction 180 degrees and was gone in less than a second.  It never stopped or made a turn.  I saw a bright whiteish light.   Since the wife wasnâ€™t driving, she spent more time checking it out and said she saw a red light at the bottom of the object. 				The whole sighting was only 5 seconds long.  Watched it coming into view for about 4 seconds, and then right back out the way it came in, less than a second later. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sober-minded and serious.  PD));27.7044999999999;-82.4337999999997
