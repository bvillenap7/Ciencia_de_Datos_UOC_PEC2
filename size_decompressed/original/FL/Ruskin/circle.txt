White dots fade in and out.;1985-06-30 00:00:00;Few seconds;White dots fade in and out I seen two ufo on my life this was the second time not any thing like the first ,, I always wanted to turn it ,, I have never heard of a report like this And I have been a coast to coast am ,,, for years,, I was in a 71 cutlas supreme ,, I had my head out the back window right side I was facing North looking up if you can picture that angle ,, any way they faded in ?? Intel they were whole they turned up for a ways than went. Right than faded back out ,, might need to explain on a phone ,, I was all ways waiting for someone to say they had saw the same thing but have never heard a report like this ,, now I'm 65 and want to turn it in,,, so it will be known ,, if guess it look like way above earth to the North ,, maybe the size of my little finger nail if I put my arm out ,, white in color the whole time ,, I thought at the time they faded in , made a course correction ,, when they fade in the bottom one come first than the second one the one one the bottom w! as out in front so when they turn up they not hit ,, and when going up the one on the left went a little faster so when they turn right they not touch ,, they both were the same distance apart the whole time ,, and when they turn they made 90Â° turns not curves they were going from West to east,, I felt like they were out past the orbit of the moon ,, put they could have been closer !! I also thought you could put 8 - 10 in a full moon ,,, I wish I could draw a photo to understand the fade in and out than you I know this is old but  it's what I saw never forget !!;27.7044999999999;-82.4337999999997
