Jesus, I swear, in my whole life I have never seen any like it. It was just there, as if it just appeared from no where. At first, I thought I was dreaming, but I felt sick to my stomach. I realized it was really happening. I had just stepped outside to scare off some fighting cats that were waking the dead. I looked up to star gaze for a moment when I saw it. It seemed to have no real shape, almost gas like, only it glowed. It was like lights being shined through dried ice or fog. Only the fog was hovering higher than the night clouds. I wasn't scare, just in awe. It lingered for about a minute, then it stretched out very thin and long. It stretched longer and thinner until it was no longer visible.;27.7044999999999;-82.4337999999997
Stars in the sky appear to be moving in the morning.  ((anonymous report));2017-11-27 05:40:00;5 minutes;Stars in the sky appear to be moving in the morning. On 11/27/2017 at around 5:40AM, I took my dogs out back, so that they can go.  I looked up to the sky, as I always do, and it was beautiful.  There were very little clouds and the stars could be vividly seen.  Suddenly, I realized one of the stars in the distance appeared to be moving from west to east.  I thought it was a comet, but there wasn't any trail behind it.  Moreover, this star/light move very fast.   I didn't want my wife to think that I was telling stories so I called her to see for herself.  By the time she came outside, the star was moving towards the east.  I pointed my spot light to the sky to who my wife what I was looking at looking at.  Immediately, she thought it was a shooting star until another star began to move int he opposite direction towards to west, at the same high velocity. I don't think they were commercial planes, because we see them all the time.  In fact, there was a plane passing by while the other star moved to the east, and it was much slower, with flashing lights.  The incident lasted for about five minutes.  So, my question is was the Military (macdill AFB), conducting any experiments in the skill this morning?  If so, do we have aircraft that is capable of such high speeds and able to fly at such high altitudes?   Note:  This is not the first time, I am seeing this phenomena in that part of the sky this is the first time I had someone else, my wife, to witness it with me. Could there be a logical explanation for this?  I'm sure it is going to happen again.  If it does, I will take recording of it.
