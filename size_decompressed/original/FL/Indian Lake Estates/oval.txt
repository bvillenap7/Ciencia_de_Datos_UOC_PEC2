Brilliant blue oval shaped object crosses sky directly overhead.;2019-04-23 12:22:00;10 seconds;Brilliant blue oval shaped object crosses sky directly overhead. Thought I heard a high flying airliner going overhead so I looked straight up and saw a brilliant blue oval shaped object definitely over 30,000 feet heading due south at a very high speed. It had a very faint and short white trail which dissipated  immediately.  I watched it until it was completely put of sight approximately 40 degrees above horizon.  It stayed exactly the same oval shape the entire time it was in sight.  I do not believe it was a meteor.  There was not sign of breaking up or changing shape.  I'am not sure if the sound I thought I heard was the object because there is lots of air traffic in this area.  It was not a fireball but a distinct object oval shaped, probably ten time faster than an airliner.;27.7914;-81.3557
