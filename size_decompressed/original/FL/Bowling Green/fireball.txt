Digital zoom camera showed C shaped formation and even a silver shape form I was turning off the water in my garden, when I seen two lites far away looked as if they were signal flares.  I watched as one started to fade out, then reappeared on the far right moving up and down side to side.  Then another appeared just above the second and looked as if it split into two.  They would stay in one spot for around one minute and fade reappearing a second later on the far opposite side. I asked my wife to grab the video cam and digital cam.  I video taped several minutes of this and zoomed in with the digital cam and found they a C shaped in every picture taken.  In some pictures what looked to be lite colorful moons in the background and somthing silver in two other pictures.  In a couple of the pictures I included my boat to make sure the C shapes were not me moving the camera.  Three Jets zipped thru the sky from Tampa in there direction and just before they got there the lites disappeared.  The jets turned around and headed back to Tampa.  I'm in my early 30's.

Red/Orange lights followed by white lights followed by storm, followed by satellite or shooting star.;2013-05-09 09:30:00;hours;Red/Orange lights followed by white lights followed by storm, followed by satellite or shooting star I'm freaking out.  This is the second time this has happened to me. It started a few months ago with this circular red glowing circle that just sits above the orange tree line. This one object stayed for hours.  I dismissed that one as, probably a star.  But know I'm not so sure about anything anymore.  Last night around 9:38 again appeared the red/orange glowing light.  So of course I'm curious and watch because it's moving.  And then there were 2,and then another light somehow fell out of the second on and the red lights just stayed in there position for awhile,then disappeared.   Now I'm freaking out..I keep watching nothing happens again for 8-9 mins.then oh yeah MORE.. I tried to count them but I was trying to get my phone to take a pic and I couldn't get it.  Then all the sudden there is 6-9 and then they start literally getting so bright that it made the sky light up..  And more happened after that but no one will probably believe me..;27.5952466666667;-81.8470533333333
