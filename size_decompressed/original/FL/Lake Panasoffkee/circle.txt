I live in Lake Panasoffkee Florida it was a clear sky. I was outside stargazing at the Pleadies  and Orion constellations with my Bushnell Binoculars I was facing due south when out of the southwest came a sparkling object I would say at the 10:00 O'clock position I immediately tried to hone in and adjust my binoculars it was beautiful and scarey at the same time. For almost 40 seconds the object I observed was like a planet.                                                                     I just couldn't believe it. At first I thought this was a huge meteor but the longer I watched it, the more it became clear that this was actually a rogue looking planet with a blue hue to it. I was literally shaking after it disappeared. I was witnes! sing a UFO coming out of the Southwest going through the top right corner constellation of Orion. I ran in the house to call NASA I left 2 messages. I googled where to report UFO'S and found your site so I called and left a message and here is the account of what I saw. It is my 3 rd time witnessing a UFO   !st time I was 14 in 1972 in Detroit Michigan my mother and I witnessed a spaceship on the corner of Junction and Toledo it had shaded 2 city blocks and looked exactly like what was the ship on Independence Day Movie I was in shock my mother grabbed me through me up the steps in the house and locked the doors closed the shades and all I could say was mom call the FBI call the Police oh my GOD. She said I was never to tell anyone ever! So I didn't Until I heard George Noory say he saw it Livonia Michigan my jaw just dropped I knew my mother and I were not the only ones. The 2nd time was several years ago I was driving a semi truck long distance in Arizona and I ! was in Tucson  Arizona watching the triangular shapes of sever! al light s in the night sky I stopped at a truck stop and this time I reported it to the police the lights were there and you could even see them when we got to Phoenix. No sound from them at all. But it sure could move a breakneck speeds. Now I want you to know I don't drink or smoke but this morning I bought a pack of cigarettes. I am 52 years old and what I have said  is the honest to God's truth I will take a polygraph Please let me know if anyone else saw this event this morning.
