((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch at 2055 hrs (EDT).  PD))   Triangular object traveling fast towards Tampa;2005-04-29 22:45:00;25-30 seconds;Triangular object traveling fast towards Tampa I was out having a late night swim in the pool (weather conditions clear - no clouds or haze and temp at 73 degrees)when I noticed an object approaching from the north traveling south.  At first glance I thought it was a passenger jet, but then realized it was way too low for the approach to Tampa Airport and absolutely silent.  I watched it fly overhead - bright white lights at the 3 corners of the triangle and 1 blinking red light in the belly.  Traveling fast - at arm's length it would take a tennis ball to cover the object. ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the witness describes above the launch of a Titan IV missile out of Cape Canaveral, which occurred at 20:55 hrs. (Eastern) on this date.  The missile apparently was launched to the northeast, so it was visible along the eastern shoreline of the U. S..  PD));28.7324;-82.3051
