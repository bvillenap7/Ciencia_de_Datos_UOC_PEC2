Pyramid shaped shiny object in sky.;2016-11-22 11:00:00;5-6 seconds;Pyramid shaped shiny object in sky I was driving East on Highway 48 toward Bushnell, Florida. I saw something pyramid shaped in the sky directly in front of me.  It was very shiny & was reflecting the sun.  I can't be sure whether or not it was emitting any light because I assumed the sun's reflection was what made it look so bright.  It looked like it was made out of shiny sheet metal. It wasn't moving at all.  I told my 5 year old son to look up at the sky but by the time I pointed to it, it was gone. He did not see it & I continued to look for it for a few minutes but could not find it again. I've never seen anything like this before & what really amazed me was that it didn't fly away quickly, it just disappeared completely.;28.7324;-82.3051
