Circular/Oval shape with red, orange, blue and green lights hovering;2003-11-14 23:15:00;20 minutes;Circular/Oval shape with red, orange, blue and green lights hovering At approximately 11:15 p.m. I went out with the dogs.  I always watch the sky as there are no outside lights around our home and star gazing is very good.  I watched this object sort of hover or wobble in the eastern sky.  There was a 1/4 moon and clear skies with no fog/haze.  The object flashed blue, green, red, and orange.  Altitude was probably 25-30,000 feet as I also watched 1 jet flying south in the west at what looked like the same altitude.  I watched it for 20 minutes then went back in the house to get the binoculars.  The object was too far away to discern any details.  Tried to get a picture with my digital camera but was unable to hold the camera steady enough for the exposure.  The object started moving slowly toward the south then disappeared.;28.7324;-82.3051
