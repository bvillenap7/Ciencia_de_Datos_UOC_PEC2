Cigar shaped object moving north to south without sound.;2013-12-14 13:30:00;20 seconds;Cigar shaped object moving north to south without sound. At approx. 13:30 hrs on Dec 14, 2013 my S/O and I were working on our motorcycle in the carport of our home.  She looked up between the branches of a tree next to the carport (east side) and at first thought she saw a large bird flying beyond the tree.   She then realized that it was not a bird in that it was much too large, much too high and did not have wings.  She called my attention to the object just as it passed the tree and flew north to south in an open area towards the horizon.   We observed the object, a cigar shape larger than most jet planes, with a black band around the middle and a red band or area on the rear end.  The object appeared to be silver or white and reflected the sun light.  The object did not emit any sound nor was there a contrail seen behind it.   We were able to observe the object for approximately 20 seconds before it left our line of vision.    We are both in our seventies and not prone to seeing things that do not exist.  I am a retired Physicianâ€™s Assistant and Registered Nurse, my S/O is a retired retail manager for a large oil company.;28.7324;-82.3051
