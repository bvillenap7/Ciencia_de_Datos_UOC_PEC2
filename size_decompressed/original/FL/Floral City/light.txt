Facing star system Pleiades.  I have noticed light  anomalies, in the night sky.   I flashed my bright flashlight well, on the pulse setting.  Stopped it...a few seconds passed.  A strange bright light moved toward earth then looped back as a needle and thread stitch ... no clouds or storms that night.   I thanked the universe, and walked briskly back to the house!  &#129335&#127995&#8205&#9792&#65039 ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
