At first he blew it off as a descending plane into PBI airport, but soon noticed it hovering and making erratic movements.  He claims it was very bright, with multicolored lights, blue red and amber which were rotating around this craft. He claims he didn't remember any sounds from it and was scared at some point too. He saw this large object descend downwards toward the ground (or ocean) at a fast rate of speed then disappeared.  He stopped a policeman later on and asked if there were any reports of any airline crashes. (He was sure it disappeared traveling downwards) The cop said there weren't any reports and suggested it might've been a helicopter doing experiments.  Although my dad wants to believe it might've been a helicopter, he knows it was much too big for one, plus it descended too fast too. (not to mention the colorful moving lights, no sound, time of day and location over a populated city)   What was interesting was my dad became scared at some point. He said it was because he was unsure of this crafts abilities. (my dad doesn't scare easily at all).  So who knows.;26.7058607142857;-80.0412642857143
