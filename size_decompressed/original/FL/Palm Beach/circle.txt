Bright light traveling speeds over 2,000 mph with no sound heading towards keys from palm beach 11/11/14;2014-11-11 21:00:00;3 seconds;Bright light traveling speeds over 2,000 mph with no sound heading towards keys from palm beach 11/11/14 As much as I do not want to believe it, what I saw was real.  The thing was going well over 10x the speed of a plane and was a very bright round light.  It appeared to be around 30,000 feet above sea level and I only saw it for around 3 seconds.  This thing did not make any sound what so ever and was definitely not man made.  I looked up google maps to see where it was headed and it was going in the exact direction of the Florida Keys, where a lot of people have seen them fly into the water.  If I had to guess how fast it was going I would say around 2,000-10,000mph and would have to say it was going to their base underground in the water by the keys.   I was on the back porch looking at the pond when it came from over the house to beyond the houses past the pond.  I know you know I saw a form of life that is much more advanced then us on earth but can not tell me the truth, all I want you to tell me is what they do here and if they are helping us become more advanc! ed. Thanks hope this helped! ((name of witness deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));26.7058607142857;-80.0412642857143
