Blinking red/orange and white light in sky;2002-06-21 01:40:00;5 min;Blinking red/orange and white light in sky I was on my balcony smoking and saw a blinking light that was red/orange towards the east. it would blink red/orange a few times then blink white and red/orange and white a few times alternately. I saw two red/orange lights fall from it. Also it is overcast and raining so it must have been below the clouds. It didn't appear to move it just stopped blinking.;26.7058607142857;-80.0412642857143
