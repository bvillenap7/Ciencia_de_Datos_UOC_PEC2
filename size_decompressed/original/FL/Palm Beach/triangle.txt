triangle shaped craft flying low and making no noise.;2004-07-08 20:00:00;3 minutes;triangle shaped craft flying low and making no noise. Was sleeping over at my grandmothers bosses house on palm beach island.  Me and my friend were looking out at the intercoastal from inside the house.  Nest thing we know we see this triangle shaped craft come towards us. It was soo low to us, probally less than a pine tree. it passed right over the house and made no noise at all. the only thing i could say this was would be a UFO, seeing that the craft was flying way too low, shaped odd, and made no noise. I wish i could provide more details but it was a while ago.;26.7058607142857;-80.0412642857143
