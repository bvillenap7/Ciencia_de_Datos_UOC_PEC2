My Pic is for scale only not actual but accurate. I was standing outside of an exit door at the south side of the building where I work,Smoking my cigar. The Sky Was Perfectly clear with great visability.  I looked up (in a slightly south West direction) toward the roof of the Everglades Club, which is right accross the street.   I Saw (from My Clear Perspective) a bell shapped object standing there in Mid air.  I did not see anything attatched to the bottom or the top of this object.  The object had no wings, tail, windows, markings of any kind.  The object made no noise at all.   After 10min. of watching this object A resident drove into the building from the north side of the building which is 180 Feel away.   As I took my last look at it, before I turned to enter the doorway the object (ever so slightly) motioned away from it's position in a very slow and controled manner.  The winds may have been about 5 mph..(a nice little breeze),  But the object was so steady even just sitting there and in it's slight movement a!way.  I didnt get to stay long enough to watch it completely leave.  I had questioned people who work at the club and they say they have nothing that would resemble what I had described to them.  This club is very exclusive and I know many people who belong to the club and they say they have never seen anything that even comes close to my description.  They believed me none the less because they know me to be an honest and a reputable person that would never fabricate such a story.   I would like to know if anyone has ever reported seeing a similar object? ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

UFO light formation sighted by aircraft.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites.  PD));2019-11-13 20:30:00;10 minutes;UFO light formation sighted by aircraft. USCG C-130 aircrew returning from SAR case over Bahamas headed back towards FL coast at 20,000ft, sighted a single straight line of 50-100 white lights, in a perfect straight line, tracking southerly at a high rate of speed at a higher altitude than our aircraft.  All 7 members on the crew saw the sighting, visible both under NVGs and naked eye.  The lights were closely spaced together, seeming covering a straight line shape at least 100NM long in the sky, not flickering, fading, waning, or glowing.  Lights moved constantly with each other, not individually dropping or drooping or changing trajectory, as in possible space debris.  Sighting lasted for approx 10 minutes, until all lights turned off/faded out of view to our far left.;26.7058607142857;-80.0412642857143
