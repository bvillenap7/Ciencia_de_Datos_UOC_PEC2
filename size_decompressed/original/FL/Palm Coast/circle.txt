Multicolored lighted circle moving extremely fast appears to be checking out RC jet at three different times during flight.;2012-06-13 10:00:00;6-8 minutes;Multicolored lighted circle moving extremely fast appears to be checking out RC jet at three different times during flight. On June 13, 2012 a good buddy of ours was doing some air flying filming as sort of a way of promoting our shop.  He was flying solo in the Palm Coast Town Center and recorded approximately 6 to 8 minutes of footage.  Once he was done, he went home (seeing nothing). Once he got home and played the video he noticed an object which appears three separate times.  It is circular and when you pause the video on it, it has multicolored lights and moves extremely fast.
