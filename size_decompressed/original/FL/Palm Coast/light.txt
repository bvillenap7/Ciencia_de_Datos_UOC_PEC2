T;2005-09-23 21:00:00;30;These sightings began on 23 Sep 2005 at approximately 2100.  Two lights one traveling north to south and the other one east to west.  The lights were very bright and traveling fast.  No other distinctions noted on the lights, thought it was a helicopter or plane but there were no noises or other lights that would signify an aircraft.  Later that night in the East is a reddish light in the sky that looked like a star or planet but this object was moving at first I thought sattelite but this was moving faster but not so fast that you would notice right away.  For the past week now until today there has been two noticible lights in the sky, they are brighter than a star and only in the sky for a short period of time.  The first is in the Western Sky at 2000 and gone after 30 mins.  The second is at 2200 in the Eastern sky.  These lights aren't doing anything spectacular, but they came the same time each night and only lasted in the sky in the same positions though moving for 30 mins and they are very bright.  Curious to know what this is.;29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063
Lights Inside our house;2009-06-12 02:00:00;2minutes;Lights Inside our house Well, my day started out with my father telling me he had seen something odd outside during the early morning hours.  He had said that the entire house was filled with a orange/reddish color light.  He had said that there was no noise to the odd lights, just looked like it was a search or beam type light.I had told my father that there has been several reports of ufo activity in our town since the 90's.But of course,we were not living here at those times.Just stories I had been told by the locals.Whatever he saw,fits to the T of what has been seen here.One report I had heard of was a low flying Triangle that had been spoted back in 2003,just down the street from where we live.That is why this sighting my father had luck of seeing,just might be something going on here in Palm Coast.Whatever it was,I am going to catch a it with my own two eyes tonight.....wish me luck....Thanks.;29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063

Orange, stationary, flickering, very bright.  Thought it was a planet (Mars or Venus), but after a few minutes it simply disappeared.   Definitely not a heavenly body.

Two Bright Stationary Lights That Fade And Separate Over Palm Coast;2019-02-09 06:00:00;5 minutes;Two Bright Stationary Lights That Fade And Separate Over Palm Coast I was sitting outside having coffee with my mother before sunrise when she pointed up and asked what is that ?.  It appeared to be two extremely bright stars very close together in the South West sky, brighter than Jupiter and Saturn which were visible in the sky to the very far left of them.   The lights were stationary for several moments before the lights dimmed to the same brightness as surrounding stars.  Then they moved together rather quickly towards the north.  One of them stopped and remained stationary while the other continued to move off to the north.  The one that remained eventually faded out completely.   Never have I seen anything like it before.  The dog even reacted by acting very strangely, then scratching to get back into the house, then lay on her bed shaking.;29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063
Glowing green lights over beach.;2019-03-22 20:45:00;10 seconds;Glowing green lights over beach. We were on the beach waiting for the moon rise.  The sky was full of stars. Many planes in flight as well. We saw two light green glowing lights in a line fly over our heads. They each looked oval in shape. Hard to determine how up but closer to the earth than the stars. The lights moved slowly above us up the coast from the south to the north. They stayed in sync with each other. They made no noise. We have (2) drones and this did not look like anything we had seen before.;29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063

I saw a green flashing light moving in a northerly direction at a very quick speed.  I thought to myself that thing is moving pretty fast.  My first thoughts was a plane but then it made a large circular movement at a speed and maneuver no conventional air craft or helicopter could possibly perform.  After it’s maneuver it went stationary for about 20sec.  After about 10 sec it started flashing a bright red.  I did not want to lose sight of it however I wanted to grab someone to validate what I saw.  I was gone for 5 seconds and when I returned it was gone.  This is something I have never witnessed before.;29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063
Bright flash by Venus,then synchronized “star dance”;2020-01-13 19:03:00;1 minute;Bright flash by Venus,then synchronized “star dance” My husband and I went out back to sit on our dock and look at the fish in the canal behind our house. We have fish lights that are very bright, and can draw anyone’s attention. We suddenly saw a bright flash of light. I wear glasses, and originally thought it was glare from Venus, because it was so bright in the sky. Until my husband asked “Did you see that?”  I then realized it definitely wasn’t my glasses reflecting light. When we looked up, there were two very bright “stars” moving in synchrony, and at the same speed. Perfectly spaced apart, I can’t emphasize that enough. They moved in perfect harmony. They both went halfway across the horizon, then Just disappeared. Here, then gone. I grew up in Phoenix, and personally saw the Phoenix lights, yet am always the person to critique people’s “experiences” and come up with a rational explanation.  If there was one for this event, I wouldn’t be writing this.;29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063
