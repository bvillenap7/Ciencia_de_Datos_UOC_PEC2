Family of three in  Palm Coast, FL saw three fire balls after reviewing video on clear night;2011-08-20 23:00:00;10 SEC;Family of three in  Palm Coast, FL saw three fire balls after reviewing video on clear night Our family went outside with a blanket and video camera around 10:30 PM-11:00 PM,to try and record the stars, the night was very clear and many stars were visible.   After 30mins, we went back inside due to the fact that we could not see the stars through our video camera(Panasonic PV-GS80).  This morning August 21, 2011, I went back to review the video tape and saw a orange oval shaped object fly across the screen.  To our suprise this was not seen visually by our family the night prior.   After, careful review and magnification using out adapater to the t.v. we saw in slow motion this object moving around and changing its shape.  Then once that object left the screen and second object followed.  This object was also orange but then changed shape into what looked like two separate diamond shapes.  Those shapes bounced around the screen and then disappeared.  Then a third object appeared in the middle of the screen and was the same as the other two.
