Whirring sound like a giant bumble bee;2008-04-21 03:30:00;20 Minutes;Whirring sound like a giant bumble bee In the early morning hours of Monday, April 21st, 2008, between 3:30 - 4:00 a.m. I was awaken suddenly by a loud whirring sound coming from outside our townhome located in a gated community in Palm Coast, FL.  It sounded like it was right over our house.  I then realized my husband had also been startled by the sound and had already been up to investigate prior to my awakening.  The sound I heard was totally unfamiliar to me.... I would describe it as sounding like a gigantic bumble bee that would get louder, trail off, and then come back again, only to then disappear altogether. My husband was clearly shaken by what he saw and heard. He told me of bright blue pulsating lights shining in through our dining/living room plantation shutters which were open.  By the time I decided to go take a look out the windows myself, it h was 4:09 a.m., and all was quiet and normal.;29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063
Unusual droning sound and rapidly pulsating blue/white lights;2008-04-21 03:30:00;20 Minutes;Unusual droning sound and rapidly pulsating blue/white lights Monday April 21, 2008, Palm Coast, Florida  Went to bed shortly after 12:30a.m., could have been as late as 1:00a.m. Was awaken up about 3:30a.m. to a strange, high pitched droning noise.  At first, I thought perhaps it was a storm brewing and the sound was a result of the wind blowing through the trees.  As the sound continued, I got up to investigate.  I walked into the living room and opened the sliding doors to the lanai.  I was amazed to learn that there was, in fact, zero wind. Perplexed, I returned to bed and tried to sleep.  The droning sound seemed to fade away.  Then the sound began to increase, getting much louder than before.  In fact, it was loud enough to awaken my wife.  She was alarmed and asked me what the strange noise was.  I told her it's been going on for some time, but that I would check it out.  I got out of bed, put on my robe, and walked through the bedroom door into the living/dining room area.  As I stepped through the doorway, a very bright pulsing  blue/white light came through the dining room windows.  It was bright an pulsing and quite frankly scared me.  I put my hand up to my eyes and backed into the bedroom.  My intent was to dial 911, but as quickly as the lights came, they stopped and the droning sound began to fade away.  The next morning, I went to the Sherriff's office and asked if they had reports of anything odd that occurred in our development during the early morning hours.  The officers checked the police log and said nothing unusual was reported!;29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063
2 bright white lights size of headlights on a car  with white light between them that weren't moving and then were just gone.;2014-12-12 22:20:00;2 minutes;2 bright white lights size of headlights on a car  with white light between them that weren't moving and then were just gone. I was in my living room when something caught my eye to my right.  I looked out my windows to my right and up in the sky I saw bright lights.  2 bright white lights about the size of headlights on a car but very close together and in between was just white light.  I was unable to make out anything that the lights were coming from because of the lights.   The lights were stationary, and then began to move to the right ever so slightly.  So slightly that they didn't appear to be moving.  Then they stopped.  Then started moving again.   At this point I jumped up and ran to my back door which is 2 feet from my sofa so it didn't take me long to get outside.  Once outside the lights were gone.  Nothing was there.;29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063
It started when I woke up, as if I've never fallen asleep, to my dog and cat both growling with their hackles standing up.;2016-08-11 07:00:00;3 hours;It started when I woke up, as if I've never fallen asleep, to my dog and cat both growling with their hackles standing up.  Something made me check my phone immediately and it had read 7:00am.  I was then overwhelmed with an extremely uneasy feeling when I noticed my window was getting brighter and brighter up until the light had filled my entire room.  I was paralyzed with fear at that moment until I remembered hearing stories of people who claim to have been abducted describe how they were paralyzed also, so I said to myself, ((deleted)). And bolted out of my room in which my cat and dog exited first with amazing speed.  I was too frightened to re-enter my room, so I stayed on the couch in the living room holding my dog who was shaking with his tail between his legs.  He would stare at the air as we listened to the unearthly and constant hovering sound and sometimes gliding sounds that seemed to come from all directions.  After about two hours whatever ! was making the gliding sounds stopped and all there was was the hovering sound.  The sounds grew faint and I had built up enough courage to try to go back to sleep.  When I got back into my bed I noticed a couple of voices that were coming from my ceiling and sounded like a bunch mumbling nonsense but from two men.  One sounding like my dad even though my mom and him claim to have been both asleep the whole time.  Then after about 5 or 10 minutes all noises ceased and my dad had conveniently woken up and entered the living room.  I got out of bed to go tell him everything that happened, he was surprised I hadn't come to wake him up during it all and I told him it could've been nothing, still in disbelief of it all.  The hairs on the back of my neck stood tall when he told me he woke up the same way at 4:00am exact, hearing the same noises. Ever since that day I've been hearing the same noises at the same times (minus the light and voices) but can't explain them, and our pets haven't been the same either.  I have no idea what it is and all I have as evidence is a recording I took of the hovering sound, the bizarre thing is it didn't pick up the hovering but instead a noise I didn't even hear the whole time recording.  Also, whenever I try to wake anyone up to come listen there is no trace of the strange sounds.  I can't sleep because of all of this and it's been driving me crazy.  Help.;29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063
