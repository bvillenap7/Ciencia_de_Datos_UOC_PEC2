A dry and clear moonlit night with light clouds.  Three boomerang shaped objects appeared in an off kilter V formation.  They looked to have a faint amber glow as if they may have been reflecting light as opposed to producing their own.  They were totally silent as they headed south at a moderately fast speed.   My first thought was possibly a spotlight from a nearby airport hitting a cloud but the objects were still visible as they moved away from the cloud and against the clear starlit sky.  They then disappeared behind the next cloud.   I waited several minutes but the objects never reappeared and no spotlights were in use at that time which eliminates that theory.;29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063
