It was dark. i saw something tremendously bright to be in the skt night but it was so i was watching it the whole walk .I noticed that it was staying within the same vecinity but still slightly moving up and down back and forth. By this time i was scared. I continued to stay outside even after i got home waiting for my roommate to come home and see it. i sat on the ground to make sure that i wan't me moving and it was that and it worked.. then i hid my fave behind a tree so i could no longer see it to see if it would move to be in my site and it did. The brightness was a yellow auburn color on the bottem brightness there was a hint of a green glow.I saw planes that were in the background so i knew it was semi close. Because of the brightness i couldn't percieve how far or close it actually was.  An hour and 30 pictures later it went down past the trees. No longer in my site anymore  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??
