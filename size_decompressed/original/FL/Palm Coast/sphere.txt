Glowing orange ball steady on SE course over Atlantic.;2016-05-30 21:15:00;~3 minutes;Glowing orange ball steady on SE course over Atlantic. Sitting on balcony and observed a faint, reddish object in NE sky.  Thought it was Mars at first, but realized it was in wrong position.  Then the object commenced moving in a Southerly direction and broke out of the clouds as a definite glowing orange ball, travelling at a high rate of speed toward the Southeast.  It continued on a Southeasterly course over the ocean until it disappeared from sight. It was a definite fully formed orange ball, reminiscent of a tennis ball.  At no time did it blink, flash or change its form or strength while it remained visible.;29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063

My fiancée and I were looking facing SE to SSE toward the south end of town.  Seemingly out of nowhere, this bright object seemingly manifested itself and slowly traversed about 1/3rd the visible night sky above us.  The object was observed traveling from west to east at approximately 45 degrees above the horizon.  The object didn’t blink and had no glare like a bright light in the distance nonetheless, the object was easily the brightest point in the sky.  The object silently and steadily moved across the sky stopping In place and hovering in the sky a few times before taking a 90 degree turn that appeared to be up and to the east.   At this time (2116 hours) I photographed the object with my iPhone camera.;29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063
