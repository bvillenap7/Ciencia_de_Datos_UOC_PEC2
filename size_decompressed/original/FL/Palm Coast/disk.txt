Disk shaped with many colors in north east and south east sky.;2002-08-11 01:02:00;20 minutes;Disk shaped with many colors in north east and south east sky. They seemed to be disk shape.  With colors of blue, green, orange, yellow and white.  Blues and reds were more easily visible.  One was in the north east and the other in the south east sky.  Not that high on the horizon.  They looked round at first, but upon high magnification, they were more flat and the lights in a straight line. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling stars??  PD));29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063

Orange orb over treeline in Palm Coast, FL seen by 2 witnesses driving South on highway 1/30/13 at 8:50.;2013-01-30 20:50:00;5 minutes;Orange orb over treeline in Palm Coast, FL seen by 2 witnesses driving South on highway 1/30/13 at 8:50 Driving South on the I-95 Highway on the West side, there was a strong, orange orb-shaped light that both the driver and myself noticed simultaneously.  It was approximately 8:50 pm.  Out first impression was to think that it was a tower that the treeline was blocking all but the top of.  However, the lights on our towers were usually red and/or white, not this glowing bright orange.   Seconds after we verbally addressed the light, it began ascending Westwards, toward the direction of the ocean that was less than 4 miles away.  It was clearly visible, hovering for moments high above the treeline, then it made a motion in which a blurry dark orange to red short tail appeared to come off of the right side of the object that made me think of the term warp speed.   I was able to take pictures with my iPhone. Almost instantly it seemed substantially smaller.  After a moment it blink out of sight then reappeared then blinked out of sight and reappea! red again. One more blink and it was gone.;29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063
My son and I watched it from my 5th floor condo balcony on the beach.;2019-05-25 22:00:00;10 minutes;My son and I watched it from my 5th floor condo balcony on the beach. It would move sharply, then come to a complete stop and hover for an extended time. It moved quickly to hover over my building. We moved our location for a better view and found ourselves looking under it. It was glowing a pinkish color with a jellyfish type look membrane underneath that seemed to have its own glow in several directions, but all contained underneath the craft.  The craft above the glowing lights was not completely visible due to the nightâ€™s sky though an outline was there. It would move at incredible speeds up to St Augustine, then back down the beach, then over to highway 95, and then back over to Marineland.  It came to full stops, hover, then move in a completely opposite direction. Finally it moved north up the coast but never over the water. If it was a drone...then hovering for so long in the sky is new to me. Interesting that there were so many small planes in the sky too, which showed us the height at which it was flying.;29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063
