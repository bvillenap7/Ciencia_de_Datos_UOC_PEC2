There was a bright white light, bigger than a star or planet moving in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Venus??  PD));2007-04-23 23:45:00;15 minutes;There was a bright white light, bigger than a star or planet moving in the sky, then it would blink a reddish color and move faster After I got off work me and another employee went outside to smoke a cigarette and as we were talking I noticed a bright light, larger than a star or planet in the sky, as I pointed it out to him he said that it was a plane, then I looked at it again and it was blinking.  Then I saw it again but it was a bright light again moving in the opposite direction. Then I really started looking at it and it was moving back and forth in the sky, when the object was moving fast it was blinking a reddish color, when it slowed down and was moving more in a straight line than curving upwards that’s when the light would get extremely bright and more of a white light.  There were also cats I saw at least three to four different cats walk across during the experience.  Another one of my employees came out and then we started taking pictures. When we zoomed in on the picture it was an oval shape. I didn’t see the object disappear but it did go behind trees until I couldn’t see it anymore. I talked to one of the witnesses the next morning and he said he saw it again on the way home that night, but that it was closer to him.  As we watched the light outside of work we could tell that it was getting closer to us, and we could also tell when it was moving farther away.  It was definitely moving faster than a plane, or helicopter, and the way it slowed down, and how the lights were moving on it- there was at least three different lights on this object.  Much larger than a plane, and the way it maneuvered in the sky was unlike any plane-much bigger than a plane. ((ADDENDUM:  Witness called on May 11, 2007, to state that she was facing east, at the time of her sighting.  If this report is correct, the object could not have been Venus, as we suggest above, but we do not have confirmation of the witness's estimate of direction.  PD));29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063

Headed from south to North and appeared to be descending. The whole incident lasted about 3 to 4 seconds before it was out of sight.  The object made no sound whatsoever.   At first I thought it may have been a shooting star or comet but the altitude was too low and it was flying across the sky not down from the sky.;29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063
