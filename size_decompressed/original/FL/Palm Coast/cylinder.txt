Metallic cylinder object;2003-11-01 12:00:00;30 seconds;Metallic cylinder object I was driving down a an open road when I noticed a metallic cylinder type object hovering about 100 feet up in the sky.  As i got closer It wasnt moving. I tried to get even closer by turning down some roads that would get me under it, but I was blocked by a couple trees and it then vanished.  I was on my way to a local resturant to meet my wife for lunch.  I told her about the event.  Once we departed she headed back to work (approx 40 min later) she got out of her car, and when she looked up in the sky she witnessed a red streaming like objectmoving quickly across the sky.  Others in the parking lot witnessed this as well.;29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063
