Succession of red lights in the sky;2013-07-04 21:00:00;30 minutes?;Succession of red lights in the sky We went to the beach to view local fireworks.  Me and 1 friend.  Just as fireworks were beginning, before it was completely dark, I noticed a strange orange/red light moving through the sky rather slowly, from south to north, just behind the beach line.  I am just guessing at the height, but it seemed to be about 60-100 feet in the air.  I alerted my friend to this odd, slow moving firework.  It had a red light in the front, and it was light enough out that we were able to see the outline of a rectangular shape craft silhouette with the light at the front. We looked at each other and said Whoa, that was weird.  There were many other people present at the beach, not a single person besides us seemed to notice the odd light in the sky (Perhaps because they were focused on the fireworks being shot out over the water, whereas this was behind the beach)  As the skies darkened, we saw another light moving in exactly the same manner.  Due to the fact the sun had set, we were unable to see a silhouette behind the light, but as the light passed, it was not visible from behind. Another and yet another of these lights passed, at about 3-5 minute intervals. 2 of the lights dropped rapidly to the ground some distance away, and then after about 30 seconds, rose back up and proceeded in the same path as the other lights.  The last and 6th light we saw flew directly over our heads as we were leaving the beach.  It seemed to be about 40-60 feet high, totally silent, and once passed, the light was not visible from behind. Being that it was 4th of July, I would have normally written this off as being chinese lanterns........but, we saw the large shape behind the first light (a rectangle approximately 6 times longer than the light itself) and the added rapid fall and then rise of 2 of the lights. Lights were viewed by 2 adult males, no drinking or other stuff involved.;29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063
