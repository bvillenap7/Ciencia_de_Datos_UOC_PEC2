Two crafts   with lights seen over Palm Coast, Florida.;2009-06-24 22:20:00;2 1/2 minutes;Two crafts   with lights seen over Palm Coast, Florida. Around 10:00 - 10:30 pm Eastern time here in Florida. A good friend of mine and myself went out front of her house to smoke a cigarette. When we went outside we lit our cigarettes and above her house back and right a little bit there was what appeared to be one craft very low. It had lights that were revolving around it at a slanted angle like this  /  It crept very slowly across the sky until it was about at our location at her house.  As it was creeping past her house a little down the block it seemed it got to the point where the lights were flashing like every other light as opposed to the full circuit we were seeing. It started moving a little faster and it passed our location was a little ways out heading up and left from our location when it just straight split and started heading two seperate directions from which it was heading.  One began heading up towards the sky higher and ever further left where the other shot at a quick enough rate where we missed it for a moment then spotted it again one more time before it faded from view heading right from the direction it was heading. The part that had us was we started to hear loud sounds of a plane in the air after it was already passed us and all the sounds came from behind us until the passed as well. The delay was around 1 minute and 30 seconds behind the craft.  We are firm believers that what we saw was not military of commercial but we are trying to get that information still.;29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063
