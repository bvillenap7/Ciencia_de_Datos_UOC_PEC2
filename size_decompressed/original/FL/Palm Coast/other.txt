Object seen between 10:45-11:10 PM  on New Year's Eve 2007(12/31/07) In the C- Section of Palm Coast Flagler County Florida USA. (This information included in the main body for further clarification.)  Object glowing seen out of the corner of my eye as I looked behind me to make sure there was no one stalking me. (I had heard there were drunkards out that night.) I then turned around and looked directly at it. I lasted over five seconds after that . it was roughly half to three-quarters the size of the full moon in size and glowed white and had a wavy tail almost like a shooting star except it was fluid and almost like it were made of a fluid light. The object dimmed and then vanished after traveling across the sky and was facing diagonally downward-right from my perspective. There was no obstruction in the way that could have blocked it to make it vanish a the point in the sky it did. May not be an aircraft at all...may be paranormal in nature though this is not provable.  It made no sound as it was moving through the sky but was most certainly low altitude due to it's relative size and clarity in comparison to an airplane that was passing at the time. It was not low enough to make a glow on the landscape below it. No sound of a crash was heard and from it's general size if it had crashed into the ground something should have been heard. It did not look like any form of aircraft or living thing that exists to my knowledge.It was not really a fireball so much as it was a hito-dama shaped light.  I was not tired, emotional, under any  great  amount of stress and have never had any form of drug or any sort of hallucination. When I saw it I got excited because I had just seen something really strange. I was surprised but not at all fearful. To my knowledge no one else witnessed this object.;29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063
Large, flame blue streak. Tapering at the tail. Spotted 9:00 pm traveling south-west.;2015-11-09 21:00:00;2 seconds;Large, flame blue streak. Tapering at the tail. Spotted 9:00 pm traveling south-west. Large, flame blue streak. Tapering at the tail.  Like a huge, up close blue comet.  Spotted 9:00 pm traveling south-west.  Watched it appear over neighbors roof until it went below tree line across the street descending at maybe 10 degrees.   Kept waiting for a crashing sound and nothing until aprox. 3 minutes later, husband and I heard distant rumbling sound.  I pulled him outside saying I've never seen anything like this before, clear skies, no sound, until the rumble.   Don't drink, don't do drugs, not actively looking for weird stuff. This thing was so bright , it MADE me look. This was no falling star.  I've seen many of those. The blue looked like the flame coming from a butane torch, not individual lights.  Also, not saying it was on the neighbors roof, that's where it entered my line of view.  The size made it seem close, but I felt it was much further away than it appeared.;29.5014501529053;-81.2075717635063
