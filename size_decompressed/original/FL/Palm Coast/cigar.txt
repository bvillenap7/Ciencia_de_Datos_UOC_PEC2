Red/Amber light in east coast Florida Sky. July 8, 2006;2006-07-08 01:00:00;about an hour;Red/Amber light in east coast Florida Sky. July 8, 2006 to bed around 1am. I looked out my window, as I always do, to look at the skies. I glimpsed at the Northern Cross, began to close the curtains, and then something registered...I saw something odd. There was a faint, red/amber thin bright line residing in the middle of a glow. It was in the middle of Daneb and Vega. I looked at it and wondered if it was a plane, reelection of panels front the space station, gas, etc. I then thought I saw it move. I watched it some move, and it did in fact move. This went on for about an hour. By its distance from me I can assume it was over Jasonville, FL. There are a lot of bases there. It was about 22 miles up, definitely in the stratosphere. It was about 1-1.5 miles in width, and it moved left to right at a rate of about 10-20 miles a second. It did move up and down a little. However, it mostly moved left to right...and not in a clean manner. It stayed about 55-65 degrees about the horizon. It stayed in the Northern Cross as the constellation moved. I am not a weirdo. I am a night sky watcher for fun. I am real into NASA. I have never seen anything I cannot explain until last night. I do not believe in ET, so I must assume it was a military craft, or perhaps an experiment of some kind...the shuttle is docked with the station. I know that Leonardo was caring experiments to the station. I know it was an object, it was flying, and I could not identify it.
