I darted into my living room to grab my new s8. That's when i attempted to locate with my camera and could not see anything, but i could with out camera.  I am actually thinking my camera wasn't working correctly because it made no sense why i couldnt see them with my fone?  They came directly over us as if they had no concerns we seen them as they kept swinging in & out of formations and changing from silverish to goldish , and this lasted a good 20+minutes, as I grew frustrated and in awe of what was moving over our heads in the middle of the day against a soild blue sky.   As they started to get out of sight I jump in to my car to follow and after a few minutes of pursuit I lost sight, then a lone jet fighter came over slowly going in the same north easterly direction!  Hmm!   Later that day I reviewed my video I was recording and noticed only tiny specs that we never seen, because they where 10 times closer then what was found in recording!;28.1039113006397;-81.623642643924
