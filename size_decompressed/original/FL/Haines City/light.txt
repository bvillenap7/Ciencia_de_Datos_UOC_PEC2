At first i thought it was 2 big stars but then i noticed it would fluctuate in size and start like flickering.  After like 2 minutes of looking at it it just vanished into thin air.  It was not a helicopter and it was not a plane, i dont know what it was but it was kinda creepy.  Just the day before I saw a blue bright light also to my east in front of my home.  This light was seen at about 15:30 pm and witnessed by me and my neighbor.  I just wrote that one off as a plane or something because im not a believer well until now.   First occurance was also in Haines City,Florida 11/27/2012.;28.1039113006397;-81.623642643924
