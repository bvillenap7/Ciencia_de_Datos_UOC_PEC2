huge pulsing red/white light in the orange groves;2002-07-24 01:00:00;10 minutes;huge pulsing red/white light in the orange groves i walked out back to the backyard to get a look at the full moon since it had just come out, i usually do every month, as i was standing there my girlfriend saw a flash of light out of the corner of her eye off into the distance aproximately 3-4 miles we can see that far from the backyard since my family owns 5 'unwooded' acres and we live atop a hill(we're surrounded by orange groves in every direction), we did'nt pay it any attention and as we were walking back in. i decided to look out some more since there were never any bright lights coming from that area and whatever it was had to be big at least 2 acres long if not longer, so as i was getting ready to leave i saw it flash a bright red and white, i can't describe how it did it but it seemed to do it simultaneusly, the shape in which it flashed was also peculiar it was oblong and flat-like that 's how i'm guessing the size, unfortunately there seemed to have been some clouds in that area because i could not make the shape out, anyways it seemed to hover above ground about 200-300 ft in the air,after that i went inside. the next morning as i was telling the rest of my family, my brother had told me taht earlier that week he ahd been in his room when a very bright red light and flashed outside and was so bright the light penetrated through his blinds he said this happened twice, unfortuantely my lazy brother did'nt mention it to anybody or else i would have been more persistent about watching that weird light flash that night...this thing is huge, i'm sure other people saw it, i hope they post as well to confirm it;28.1039113006397;-81.623642643924

Large orange light flying fast and low in central Florida, headed south.;2018-10-08 21:00:00;10 seconds;Large orange light flying fast and low in central Florida, headed south. I was driving east 1-4 towards Orlando.  A large, bright, orange/tan light was flying fast and low across the highway headed south.  It had no blinking or multi-colored lights similar to a drone or airplane.  It disappeared beyond the treeline and then could not be located.  Sighting was in a particularaly dark and unpopulated portion of the highway.;28.1039113006397;-81.623642643924
