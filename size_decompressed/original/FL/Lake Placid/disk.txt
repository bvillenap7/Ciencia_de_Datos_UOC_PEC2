2 large spinning red orange discs and dozens of star sized craft,;2019-05-16 22:00:00;10 minutes;2 Large spinning red orange discs and dozens of star sized craft, My boyfriend and I were having drinks and listening to music on my lanai when he heard a jet turning around really fast and he said “there is something going on up there” so we ran outside and looked up and saw dozens of star sized bright objects shooting all over the sky and making impossible maneuvers.  Then a huge orange red long object came spinning at us vertically with other small orange red objects shooting out of it.  Very beautiful.  It disappeared and then another one, a little bigger came and did the same thing.  Awesome.;27.297;-81.3647
