Two sets of orange lights in a triangular pattern, no sound, no movement, slowly pulsing.;2015-06-08 21:30:00;30 minutes;Two sets of orange lights in a triangular pattern, no sound, no movement, slowly pulsing. 9:30 pm, partly cloudy.  Three bright orange lights in a triangular pattern.  Unknown height in sky, estimate of 1-2 miles up.  Slightly dimmer set of 3 lights in a triangular pattern near the first set of lights.  First set was clearly visible as a triangle.   The second set was positioned at a lower angle so that it seemed like three lights in a row.  When the first set would dim, the other set would brighten.   Clearly hovering, clouds below lights had an orange hue.  Both sets visible for approx 30 minutes.  The brightest set was first to vanish, then the second set.   No sound, no movement, very slow pulsing of brightness that seemed to go from one set to the other.  Second set not nearly as bright.;27.297;-81.3647
