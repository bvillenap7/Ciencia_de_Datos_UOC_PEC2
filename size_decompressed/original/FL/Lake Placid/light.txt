Smaller than full moon. Came toward us from the east. Sky was clear.  Light on left slightly lower altitude. Right light made circular move to the left in direction of left light. Then turned and rapidly gained altitude until it went out of sight. Left light acted independently. Maintained relative position to right light and followed it up out of sight. Witnessed by two ladies in the courtyard of Lake Blue Resort Condominiums in Lake Placid, FL and male firefighter in Ft. Myers FL All 3 have observed rocket launches from Cape many times. Definetely  not a rocket.. ((NUFORC:  Missile launch.));27.297;-81.3647
Two bright lights that moved around in the sky.;1998-03-24 21:50:00;30 minutes;Two bright lights that moved around in the sky. My wife and I were driving north in separate vehicles on U.S. 27 about 15 miles south of Lake Placid, Fl. We saw through our windshields  two bright, orange lights appear to the north east about 30 degrees above the horizon. The right light was higer than the left. They moved slightly to the left in unison and blinked out. We stopped our vehicles and the lights suddenly reappeared  about 30 degrees to the left of their original location. Now the lights were closer together, more like two very bright auto headlights. Only they were yellowish orange. The color of sodium street lights. In fact that's what they reminded me of. We observed them in this position for several minutes then they began to dim then return to their original brightness. They went and reappared about a minute later about 30 degrees to the east. Then the left light slowly descended and went out. The other light remained in the sky for several minutes and then dimmed and went out. First observed at about 2150hrs. Last observed about 2215 hrs EST. Observed almost continuously for about one half hour. I worked at TRW for 11 years in their aerospace program. I have witnessed many launches from Cape Kennedy. These were not missles. They were very bright lights that moved independently,   were as bright as flares and the same color. Most of the time they were stationary in the sky. They didn't move in unison but when they  reappeared  they would be together in the same part of the sky. Sometimes one would blink out before the other and then when they reappeared one would blink on before the other.;27.297;-81.3647
Bright object noted in sky, abruptly disappeared without a trace.;2002-01-30 22:45:00;30 seconds;Bright object noted in sky, abruptly disappeared without a trace. While flying at an altitude of about 4000' a bright light was noted bearing about 170 degrees and 20 degrees above the horizion from our position over Lake Placid, FL. The light appeared to be the color of sodium vapor street lights (orange). I pointed it out to my passenger and in obout 20-30 seconds it abruptly disappeard completely.  It was not possible to determine the movement or distance from our position it could be. A simular experience was noted by my neighbor the next night except there were four lighs and appeared to move in two pairs.  These also abruptly disappeared but left random sparkling in the area.;27.297;-81.3647
Fast Moving Light High up in Atmosphere;2005-04-16 22:00:00;2 minutes;Fast Moving Light High up in Atmosphere Looking at the stars, our friend pointed out 2 jets flying together. He said they are always there because of a practice bombing sight in Avalon. They were to the Northwest. They did look like planes to me.  But to the Northeast, I pointed out a light the size of a star, moving at extreme speed. It was really high up, and then we lost sight of it. The night was really clear, the stars were bright. No clouds. It was between 10:00 to 10:30 PM. For as high up as it was, moving like it was, it had to be going an unimaginable speed. Our friend said it could have been the space station. I'm not convinced that it was.;27.297;-81.3647
Two amber lights that extinguished and then pairs of tiny silver lights moving away rapidly.;2013-05-08 20:50:00;5 minutes;Two amber lights that extinguished and then pairs of tiny silver lights moving away rapidly. We were sitting in the backyard looking North by Northwest over the house.  We saw two amber lights appear over the roof – one, then the other.  Each amber light “burned out” and suddenly there were 6-8 tiny silver lights that then moved away quickly from the location of the amber lights.   They moved out in all different directions, but went in pairs.  The pairs stayed relatively close together, but did not follow a specific formation.  The tiny silver lights moved VERY quickly across the sky – much more quickly than conventional aircraft, and with no noise.   The silver lights blinked rapidly. The lights moved out of our range of vision after approximately 5 minutes.  We watched the pairs as long as we could.  We did see 3 different airplanes in the sky and were able to judge the speed against the conventional crafts.  It did not appear the airplanes were chasing the lights, however, one craft was near the path of one pair of the silver lights and seemed to be on a similar flight path.;27.297;-81.3647
More than 75 lights moving high up in the sky for more than 10 minutes from the SW to NE.  ((Starlink satellites?)).;2020-05-17 05:00:00;10 minutes;More than 75 lights moving high up in the sky for more than 10 minutes from the southwest to the northeast. Starting around 5:00 am on Sunday 17th, After my morning run, I was looking up in the sky and saw lights moving from the southwest to the northeast extremely high in the sky, 4 to 5 times the altitude that an airplane would be flying. This lasted for 10 to 12 minutes. There was no pattern to the line of lights that came across the sky. Sometimes they would be several in a close line, sometime side by side or even two along side each other with one trailing. Some time they were spaced evenly and other times groups of 3 to 5 would be crossing. Nothing was flashing, and speeds were generally the same as they crossed. At one point there were 2 side by side with 2 trailing close, then one of the trailing lights made an abrupt right turn and leaded away. I went inside and woke my wife to see this. Once back outside they continued for several more minutes. During this entire time, I saw at least 75 to 80 of these lights cross the sky. I counted that during one poin! t there were 16 within my view from the southwest to the northeast sky.;27.297;-81.3647
