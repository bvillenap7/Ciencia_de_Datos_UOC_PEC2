Red, green, and white lighted object moving horizontally and vertically with great speed, all while sorrounded by 5 helicopters.;2008-01-14 21:00:00;40 Minutes;Red, green, and white lighted object moving horizontally and vertically with great speed, all while sorrounded by 5 helicopters. We noticed an unusual red light in a clearing by our apartment. Initially we though nothing of it because it looked similar to a helicopter except the lights had an unusual pattern.  The red lights began on the left, moved to the front, and then moved to the right, this was followed by a complete fade of the red light into a very bright green light that encapsulated the entire object, followed by a bright white light.. This pattern of lights continued through the viewing.  The object moved across the sky until reaching a clearing directly West of us, it hovered for a few minutes and began moving up and down quickly. it continued to move in a horizontal and vertical pattern for about 30 minutes until 5 white lights approachedThere was also a few jets in the air flying around the object, which is unheard of in our area. The object finally began moving upwards and quickly shot up and dissapeared out of sight, moving at a speed I have never seen before and it went from a immobile hovering state to an incredibly fast upward motion. The helicopters immediately left once the object did.;28.6625610540732;-81.4102576317589
