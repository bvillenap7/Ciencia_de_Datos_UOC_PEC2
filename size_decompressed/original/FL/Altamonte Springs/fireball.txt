The objects merged as one.;2006-06-06 20:05:00;Three hours;The objects merged as one. Standing at Cranes Roost right by the New Watch Tower around 8:05PM. In the sky there were 3 red stars moving at high speeds. We watched the objects for around 1 hour, then suddenly the objects started to fly towards each other. It looked like they were trying to crash into each other, possibly fighting. After an hour or so, there was a very bright light in the sky and the objects seemed to merge as one. Then for about the next thirty minutes there were strange lights and then  it started to rain out of nowhere. All of us started to run to a near by sheltered area, then the object started to fly directly downward.;28.6625610540732;-81.4102576317589
The three objects merged as one.;2006-06-06 20:06:00;three hours;The three objects merged as one. We were standing at Cranes Roost, near the new watch tower around 8:06PM.  We were looking at the sky when we noticed there were 3 stars that were very red and moving at high speeds through the air.  We continued to watch for about 1 hour, when they then started to fly towards each other.  It appeared that they were trying to crash into each other.  Maybe fighting.  After about an hour and a half, there was a bright light and then the crafts seemed to merge as one.  Then for the next 30 mins there were strange lights and then it started to rain intensly out of nowhere.  We ran from where we were over to a nearby sheltered area. Then the rain stopped and the craft seemed to fly directly downward.;28.6625610540732;-81.4102576317589
From the siting you would be able to determine where it entered and how low it was before it vanished;2011-04-29 22:00:00;7 seconds;From the siting you would be able to determine where it entered and how low it was before it vanished A large fireball entered the atmosphere traveling downward for a maximum of 7 seconds and then it looked as if it burnt up in the Earths atmosphere at a low level.  Unlike a metor or falling star.   As soon as it was gone the sky filled with four flying crafts mostly airplanes because of the lights, but they surrounding the area and moving towards the site in the sky.  One witness saw the fireball and both saw the other crafts.;28.6625610540732;-81.4102576317589
Multiple groups of bright orange fireball like lights flying slowly in formation Orlando area.;2014-05-19 21:00:00;5 minutes;Multiple groups of bright orange fireball like lights flying slowly in formation Orlando area. While taking my trash out to the curb, I noticed 3 large, bright orange lights flying lowly in what seemed to be a formation coming from the south.  They were travelling rather slowly and did not have any other flashing lights like you would normally see from an airplane so it struck me as odd.  They made no sound and moved very slowly.  I then noticed 4 more of the same lights coming behind them from the same direction.  I quickly ran in to the house to grab my two kids so they could see them too.  When we got back outside there was another group of 3 coming up from behind the second group. My view in that direction is partially blocked by some tall pine trees so I was only able to see the lights through the breaks in the trees as they moved toward us.  I moved my position to get a different angle so I could see them better after they passed the trees, but they never appeared on the other side.  I then went back to my original spot where I could then see another small group approaching but the first few groups were nowhere to be found.  I followed the lead light in that group to try and see where they were going and it basically seemed like it made a slow hard left turn, travelling away from my vantage point, until it faded from view and the others followed. In total I saw 5 or more groups totaling approximately 16 or more lights.  All were in groups of 2 to 4 and traveled in a similar path in what looked like a loose formation of sorts.  I have never seen anything like this before and in hindsight I wish I had thought to count exactly how many I saw.  I was so surprised at what I was seeing that it never crossed my mind to count how many lights or groups I was seeing.  Each of the lights looked very similar to what an ignited flare looks like, just more orange in color than the vibrant red of a road flare.  I spend lots of time outdoors and love looking at the stars in the night sky. This is the first time I have ever seen anything that I could not identify.;28.6625610540732;-81.4102576317589
