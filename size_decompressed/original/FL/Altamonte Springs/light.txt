Fast moving star like light coming at us.;1997-06-15 00:00:00;1 minute;Fast moving star like light coming at us. It has taken me several years to talk about what happened because when we told anyone no one would believe us. People always look at us like we're crazy but we are two perfectly sane educated people. My cousin who I was spending my summer with in orlando well we were outside in her backyard. We were in the pool late just talking, looking at stars and I remember telling her how in south fl you can't see them the same way. We just kept looking up and we thought we were seeing a shooting star so we got all excited. I remember we were facing west. And then the star seem to just race toward us. It was coming straight at us. We were so frightened we got out of the pool and I remember just seeing this light above us. White round light it was like a sun but smaller and very quiet and I remember that we just got so scared that we ran in the house screaming. Now that I think back the light did not shine on anything else. It was like not shining on no other surface. We! ran in her room. The weird part was that we screamed so loud and no one came out to see If we were ok. It was like it was so quiet that we just didn't even make noise when we were screaming. I remember feeling tired and then it was the next day. Honestly that's all I remember till this day. That light, that star and I just wonder if anyone has seen anything like this? I can't explain it but I need to know what I saw.;28.6625610540732;-81.4102576317589
Red lights in the night sky.;2014-05-19 21:00:00;15 minutes;Red lights in the night sky. A friend and I were sitting at the cranes roost, In Altamonte Springs.  We were just sitting there after having gone for a brisk walk and I noticed something coming out of the sky from the East.   There were three red lights moving in a westerly direction.  It appeared they were in a formation.  Behind them was another three, and then another three.   At first it appeared that there was a total of 12.  The first 12 one by one disappeared into the night sky.  Then there appeared another set of 12 coming in formations of three.  Those 12 disappeared into the sky too.  There was no sound, no motion, no flickering of light.  There was just 24 solid red lights that vanished into the sky.;28.6625610540732;-81.4102576317589
