Two triangle shaped UFOs were seen hovering about 4 or 5 stories above common (open city) area.  The crafts were triangle shaped and had 3 lights at the tips and one in the center.  They moved in un-natural flight patterns at very slow speeds and made no sound whatsoever.   Crafts eventually went out of site, however, shortly after we lost sight of the UFOs the entire sky turned a blue/white flashing light and looked a lot like when a transformer blows only this much much larger.  And towards the end of the flashing, the sky turned completely white for a solid 3 seconds, then all odd activity appeared to be over.;28.6625610540732;-81.4102576317589
