Sphere shaped UFO Seen in Altamonte Springs, FL by a young girl 10/12/06;2006-10-12 17:50:00;30 sec. +/-;Sphere shaped UFO Seen in Altamonte Springs, FL by a young girl 10/12/06 I was sitting on the second floor stairway of my apartment building, smoking a cigarette and waiting for my roommate to come outside to take him to work.  It was still light out, and i was looking at the sky as i often do, and saw what appeared to be a sphere-shaped silver metal object flying to the north, at an altitude of what couldnt have been more than 200 ft., maybe a quarter mile if that from where i was sitting.  It was traveling fairly slow, at a steady speed, and then I tried to take a picture of it with my camera phone but the lighting and distance made it impossible to get a good shot.  It then passed behind a tree branch, and i waited to see it in between the trees, but it just disappeared.  Now i know that it is not a plane.  It was too close and the shape was clearly not of any human flying machines.  I believe it cut a quick 90 degree turn east when it disappeared because i went downstairs to get a better look, and was looking at where it should have been at that point if it was still traveling the same speed and there was nothing.  I told my roommate about it when he came down, i expected him to laugh at me and not take me seriously, but this is something that i would never joke about (no matter how much i wish they would come and take me away.) I later told my boyfriend about it and my uncle, who is a retired scientist.  Everyone i told took me seriously, and i am constantly looking out for my little friend everyday, hoping to get a picture to prove i wasnt just seeing what i wanted to see.  when i first saw it i had to stare for a bit to make sure i wasnt seeing things, but i was staring for at least 30 seconds before i got my camera phone out of my pocket, so im positive of what i saw.  I am and always have been a firm believer in life from other planets visiting us, i just hope next time i see it they come a little closer!  By the way, i am a 24 year old female, i deliver pizzas for a living, and i have a hobby of taking pictures of cloud formations, so i often spend ! alot of time looking up at the sky, as do i spend alot of time researching the UFO sightings.  I am not trying to impress anybody with a made up story-i have nothing to gain for lying. I just hope someone else saw it or knows what that might have been- it looked like a ufo i saw in a picture once.  Well its a silver ball-like object. It was flying. thats all i can tell u for sure. Oh yeah and i didnt hear any noise that might have been made by the craft, but it was a good ways away.;28.6625610540732;-81.4102576317589

Well I looked up in the sky and I saw one strange red/orange light (I never saw a light like this in the sky).  I told the family a guys take a look at this it is strange and it does not look like an aircraft and the most important was making NO NOISE.   After this went by another was coming behind it (traveling NW) at the same speed and straight line, after this another one and all together they were six, one after the other at the same speed, one behind the other holding same distance between them till they disappeared.;28.6625610540732;-81.4102576317589
