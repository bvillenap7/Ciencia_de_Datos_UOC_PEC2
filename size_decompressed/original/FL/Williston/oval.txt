I happened to be looking into the western sky and noticed a fast-moving light which appeared above the tree lines but far above the horizon. There was no sound, no flashing light or lights and just one large light. This was not a falling star because it moved at approximately 15 degrees along the horizon traveling north to south. it seemed to have a haze or halo around it. I have never seen anything like this and thought it might be an asteroid, meteorite, or comet. Were there any reports of this?;29.4029;-82.4817
