There's a strange smell too...  Like sulfur.  I don't know what it was, but it scared the crap out of me! It was a sphearical shaped ball of light.  It just zipped up about 50 ft. off the ground and shot away, up at an angle through an oak tree, burning a hole right through a giant limb just like a hot knife through butter! I'm just a normal person that went out side to look at the comet, hail-bop.;29.4029;-82.4817
