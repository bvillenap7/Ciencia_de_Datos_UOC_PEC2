possible explosion above the earth's atmosphere. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD));2007-12-10 19:00:00;35 minutes;possible explosion above the earth's atmosphere Some sort of explosion above earth's atmosphere.   I was getting into my truck at seven pm when I sighted a brillantly glowing cloud.  The glow appearred almost directly overhead but somewhat to the north and west, from my location in Williston, Florida.  I quickly called my wife who is currently in Canada, and she went outside and saw the same glowing cloud.  I was able to view the object through night vision monocular and it appeared very much like a comet with a nucleus and tail aligned toward the northwest initially the tail was nebulous, but also contained a split so that it appeared as a V.   But this appeared to be drifting toward the east very slowly, but too fast to be a comet.   As I was observing the cloud I saw five distinct small flashes of light toward the nucleus area  gradually the object faded in luminosity and disappeared.
