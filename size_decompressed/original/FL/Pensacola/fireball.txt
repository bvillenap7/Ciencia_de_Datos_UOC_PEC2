illuminating firey red ball that slowly sunk over the bay between Pensacola and Gulf Breeze;1998-12-11 19:50:00;4 minutes;illuminating firey red ball that slowly sunk over the bay between Pensacola and Gulf Breeze It was that evening that I saw something that still has me wondering to this day.  A bright red ball that illuminated the sky a little and drifted down over the bay.  I was playing a joke on my sister and her friends to try and scare them.   We had an awning that would roll down to protect the glass door.  It was rolled down and I was going to beat on it to scare them in the living room.  I first noticed what looked like a plane's headlamp coming at me, but that was normal because I live near the airport.  So I started pushing on the awning a little to see if anyone would notice when I realized it was getting brighter outside.  I look back at where I saw the plane and there was a bright red ball in the sky slowly sinking over the bay.  It seemed so close that I was too scared to run 10 ft to the garage door!  I beat on the awning like crazy until one of the people there opened it and saw the object before it went behind the trees.  10 minutes later there was a huge thuderstorm that spawned severe thunderstorm warnings.  It was really strange. I've never really put much confidence in the whole extra-terrestrial thing but I know I saw something that night and struck me as very strange that other people here reported similar sightings.  Many people here I know have said at some point or another they have seen something wierd in the sky, mainly at night.  Not all are valid obviously, but many people in the Pensacola, Gulf Breeze, Navarre and Pensacola Beach area seem to have seen a red firey looking object moving around the bay or gulf.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
Green Fireball, no lasting contrail, strange trajectory.;2003-09-24 18:45:00;4 seconds;Green Fireball, no lasting contrail, strange trajectory. Went to pic up a video at the rental store, it was approaching sunset and I was walking back out to my car from the store.  In my peripheral vision to my left (north-northeast)there was a millisecond of a brief, searing glare as if someone had aimed a laser pointer at me, I then turned my head and saw an extremely fast green, almost sea green-colored fireball (possibly a large meteor).  Being an avid offshore fisherman I have seen many large fireballs when out in the gulf at night.  The things that struck me as odd besides seeing this in relative daylight, was the trajectory of the object and the fact that there was no contrail remnant.  Instead of an arching trajectory from horizon to horizon, this object was coming down at a very high 'angle of attack' and did not fade as it approached my observable horizon which was approx. 1/2 mile away.  I was only aware of one other person (also in the parking lot) that observed this object.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
A bright Green, almost flourescent in color decending down from the sky at a constant speed to only vanish not vaporate.;2003-09-25 20:45:00;10-15 seconds;A bright Green, almost flourescent in color decending down from the sky at a constant speed to only vanish not vaporate. It was around 8:45 pm when I went outside to take the garbage out when a bright green light from the sky caught my eye.  I looked up and saw a bright green, almost flourescent in color, fireball descending down from the sky and knew from the size of it it was to large to be a falling star.  It lasted for 10 to 15 seconds before it vanished, not vaporized or breaking apart but just vanished.  The more I sit here and think of the occurence the more I realize that it was not going at an incredible speed such as a falling star shooting into the atmoshphere, but more of a constant speed, then accelerated for 1 or 2 seconds then to only disapear. .  The fire from the rear of it looked as if fire does on the back of a jet thrusting forward or faster, this is the only way I can think of to describe it. Also if it helps I was off of Gulf Beach Hwy near Perdido Key and it looked as if it were descending down towards the intercoastal waterway. It was the size of possibly 2 softballs put together. I plan to try to draw an illustration of the object and send it in if I am able to reproduce the same image on paper. I can only hope that my description helps in any way and to wish that I knew what it was that I saw.  I know it is an experience that I will never forget. Be it a meteorite or an unidentified flying object, I truly believe that we are not alone nor have we ever been. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and she sounded to us to be quite credible, and to be a good observer.  No other reports from this area of the U. S..  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION WITH WITNESS)) I wanted to let you know that I have found 3 other witnesses from that night, but they said they would feel crazy calling a ufo hotline. And then a few nights ago my neighbors called me and said they were watching the green fireballs in the sky and they were so excited to see them. It was 2 from my understanding. I was going into surgery the next morning and have not talked to them since but I am sure they would call, I am going to call them and give them the hotline number and her husband was in the military here in Pensacola so he would know more about the latitude and longitude than I would. Thank you for the response hope all is well. Sincerely,  ((name deleted)) ((END));30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349

Saw an extremely bright red light slowly moving down from the sky with one trail of smoke starting high up...I got a picture but it is blurred, though it is obvious that it's something out of the ordinary.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
Looked like a fiery fiery snowglobe.;2011-12-24 22:00:00;15 minutes;Looked like a fiery fiery snowglobe It was christmas eve 2011. I had come down to visit my family.  We were jingling bells for my nieces outside of their windows.  My father loves that.  So as he was coming back to the car in the dark he looks up and screams, Oh my god there they are!   He signaled for my mother and I to get out of the car.  At that point my brother comes out of the house along with his father in law.   My father(an ex pilot and a doctor) had spotted 5 orbs encircling eachother in a strange fashion and then traveling away from each other in random order each light slowly blinking off.   They moved slowly in circular fashion and silently.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
Orange ball shape and not engine exhaust, no nav lights;2013-08-30 19:30:00;1-2 minutes;Orange ball shape and not engine exhaust, no nav lights About 7:30 PM I saw an orange object which looked like 1/4 inch diameter ball at arms length. I moved from West to East about the speed of a passenger jet coming in to land as it lines up for descent.  There was a plane to the Northwest that I could see the navlights on.  It was overcast and I could not see the stars. I know what jet engine exhaust at night looks like as  I live near NAS Pensacola, Eglin AFB, and Hurlbert Field and I am accustomed to seeing engine exhausts at night from various planes and helicopters. The object did not have distinct shape but gave the appearannce of fire. The orange color is compared to paint would be flat not glossy.  It moved in a staright line direction and eventually either reduced in intensity or passed out of site into the overcast. Total length of time was a minute or maybe two, I didn't look at the time.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
Something blue fell from the sky and crashed.;2015-09-09 21:20:00;4 seconds;Something blue fell from the sky and crashed. I saw an object fall from the sky, wrapped in blue fire, and with and orange fire trail behind it.   It flashes orange light reflecting in the clouds surrounding it and was then gone.   Soon after, I have spotted three different aircraft, assuming military, flying low and around where it crashed.
