Flash in a Pensacola sky;1995-06-01 21:00:00;5 min.;Flash in a Pensacola sky This has always been hard for me to talk about, but I think it’s time to share my experience so I can put it behind me. When I was eight years old my sister, my dad’s friend son and I were in their backyard jumping on a trampoline.  The three of us were by ourselves and our parents and other siblings were inside doing who knows what.   ((name deleted)) was irritating me by jumping right next to me and I started to wrestle with him meanwhile my sister is laughing at us sitting on the other side of the trampoline.  It was a pretty clear night with just a few clouds in the sky with a gentle breeze which I remember clearly because it’s so humid in Florida and it was one of the few evenings as a child that I was unsupervised and outside to enjoy the sea breeze.  The next few moments are hard to describe put I will do my best. Their was a bright flash of light so bright that I was blinded momentarily to tell the truth I’m not sure how long it seemed like a long time but I’m sure it was only seconds. It was almost like a strobe light you know how everything seems like it’s in slow mo.  After the flash, it looked as if a bright ball of light fell in the woods maybe 30 or 40 feet away from the trampoline.                                                                     My sister, ((name deleted)), and I were stunned.  We scrambled off the trampoline and raced to the backdoor. Enroute I saw 4 different colored lights blink in the woods. (Yellow, blue, green and red) After that I heard a strange noise that’s even harder to describe it was like a metallic computer sound with one beep after the other with each beep a different pitch. By this all happened in seconds I think. By the time we had heard and seen the different colored lights and the beeping noises we were at the back door pounding on it for someone to let us in. Meanwhile there was a rustling in the woods which could have been a dog or other animal but I’m just not sure given the other things that had just occurred. Matty’s older brother came and opened the door maybe a minute or two after we had started pounding on it and we all rushed into the! kitchen The three of us were hysterical and proceeded to report the events that had just happened to matt’s brother and then told our parents who of course could not say what had happened and made it seem we were making it all up which to this day bothers me that my own parents think it was a prank or that we were flat out lying. So I hope that this may help someone else who has seen something similar to me experience.  Thank you for your time. ((initials deleted));30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
