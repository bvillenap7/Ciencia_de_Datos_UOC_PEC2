We were fishing at the foot of the three mile bridge when my brother and his wife began arguing.  I was tired of hearing it, so I went and sat down on the seawall and cast my line.  I started staring at the sky and became fixed on what I thought was the north star... after they finished their fight, my brother came over to chew my ear off in his venting process.  Because the light was so bright, he also became fixed on it as we sat there talking... then, all of the sudden, at light speed it zipped up and away leaving that streak of light behind it.  I was still disbelieving what I saw when my brother asked 'did you see THAT?'  I let him tell me, just to be sure that he had really seen it too.  He described the exact same thing and thereby validated what I saw for me. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
Pensacola beach UFO sighting 2:34 pm;2002-03-07 14:34:00;1 minute;Pensacola beach UFO sighting 2:34 pm I went to Pensacola Beach (Pensacola FL) on a Tuesday with my Olympus digital camera. I was down by the pier and saw a Big transport plane coming across the coast close to the shore line.  I put my camera in 5 picture per second and took some photos of the transport.  NO other planes were in site.  When I got home and looked at these pictures, another OBJECT appeared in two frames.  It couldn't have been a bird since the plane was so big and the OBJECT was almost the same and following the transport pland.  At the time, I saw nothing else in the sky except the transport plane. No other sound.  It was a clear day and I have the pictures I would like you to see. ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photos.  The transport is a C-130, presumably on approach, since its landing gear and flaps are deployed.  The object looks like a bird, perhaps an osprey.  PD));30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
Bright round pinpointed flashing white light traveling from the north to the south at a high altitude.;2016-03-10 04:10:00;30-45 seconds;bright round pinpointed flashing white light traveling from the north to the south at a high altitude. I had just arrived home from working the night shift.  It was approximately 0410 in the morning.  It was windy outside, due to an approaching storm system from the west, but a part of the sky was clear and there were approaching clouds.  I decided to stop outside my front door to take a look at the sky, and listen to the wind blowing through the trees.  While looking up into the night sky at almost ninety degrees I observed a single bright pinpointed flash of white light.  I can only describe it as appearing like the flash of a camera except much slower and estimated to last approximately one to one and one half seconds.  I was amazed at how bright this light was when it flashed. It appeared to be extremely high in the sky and there were no other lights to accompany it.  There was no aircraft engine sound that I could hear.  It would flash approximately every ten to fifteen seconds and it was moving from north to south.  It was above cloud level, as I tracked it by its flash, I could no longer see it as it passed above the approaching clouds.  I could not see any type or shape of a structure around the light.  But it must have been attached to an object as the light seemed to dim slightly as it traveled south.  It traversed the sky directly over Pensacola NAS.  I have lived in the vicinity of Pensacola NAS for approximately twenty years and have never observed anything like this before.  I have served in the military and am extremely familiar with aircraft beacon, strobe, navigation, and landing lights. I thought possibly some type military drone, but the wind was very strong and I am not sure if the military would fly a drone in such weather.  It must have been at an altitude above the storm weather as it did not appear to be affected by the wind.  I can only guess at its speed and I would say possibly four to five hundred knots.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349

Estimated speed of less than 100 mph.  Craft itself had a slight glow from fire propelling it but couldn't see enough to identify shape. Estimated size less than 10 meters diameter based on size of flame diameter.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
