A police officer was heard reporting seeing something at the same time. I was with 3 friends on the west in of Pensacola Beach in Ft. Pickens State Park when we saw a silver sphere shaped object with what looked like windows all the way around it.  We were in a convertable so it was easily seen.  It flew toward us then hovered about 100 ft (I don't judge distance well but it was close) over us.  It was almost as if it was watching us or wanted us to see it.  Then it suddenly flew away in the opposite direction.  I can't remember because it was so long ago but it had lights inside that either dimmed when it hovered or dimmed when it flew away.  We were teenagers and I never told my parents as I thought they'd think I was crazy, but one of the other witnesses told her mother.  Her mother said she'd listened to a police scanner the night we saw it and heard a beach deputy come on the radio and state that he had also seen something.  She said he made a comment about not believing what he saw so it was obvious that it was something very unusual. ((NUFORC Note:  We have assigned an arbitrary time and date.

Orange Sphere over Northwest Florida;2003-11-10 22:21:00;5 - 8 secs.;Orange Sphere over Northwest Florida Went out for a smoke.  Looked up.  Moon was very bright, no clouds.  Object came from the north.  If you put your hands side by side, it was four hand spaces west of the moon.  Object moved south very fast.  Faster than a plane or satellite.  Was not a shooting star either.  It did not leave a tail like shooting stars do.  Object appeared to be in earth's atmosphere.  Moon appeared about three fingers wide. Object appeared a bit larger, probably six fingers wide.  Object was bright, yellow-orange in color.  Object appeared to have a solid center (bright, yellow-orange)with a hallo or ring farther out.  It just streaked acroos the sky from north to south, then it was gone.  Almost like it appeared from thin air and vanished into nothing.  There was no sound before, during or after and no vapor trail or tail of any kind.  I would be very interested to know if any radar picked up anything on that date and time.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
Saw Red/Orange circular glowing objects.;2005-11-07 15:00:00;a minute or so;Saw Red/Orange circular glowing objects. Dan and I had made a trip over to Pensacola (which is right next door to Gulf Breeze where all those alleged sightings took place back in the day). It was an afternoon in early November. The whole day had been overcast and you couldn't see anything but low, dark clouds.. the sun was never in sight. We were heading home over the Pensacola bridge, which is really long.. I was in the passenger seat looking out over the water, where I saw a very bright orange glowing something-or-other with 3 smaller orange glowing something-or-others hovering around it. We were going about 65 miles an hour and it appeared that the 4 objects were stationary. I always bring my digital camera when we go to P-Cola, so I moved quick to grab it and take a picture. When I finally got the camera on and ready, the 3 smaller objects were gone and only the large one remained. I managed to get one picture.. I didn't get anymore because I must have looked away for just long enough, that when I tried to capture it again, it was gone. I know we couldn't have been the only ones that saw it. There was plenty of traffic on the bridge and there were quite a few people fishing from the shore that was directly facing where the objects had been. It sucks that I didn't get a better or long enough view of the objects.. it all happened so quickly.. but I can still see it in my mind of it hovering below the cloudline. Like I said, I don't know what it was or that it was anything strange, even though it seemed totally out of place to anything I've ever seen in the sky. Some people bring up that it might have been flares.. could be. I don't remember seeing or hearing any passing aircrafts that would have been dropping them though. Other than that, what could it have been? It was in our immediate atmosphere, in the middle of the day, it couldn't have been any falling stars, comets or any of that stuff, could it? It wasn't no damn weather balloon, either. Who knows? I just know it was weird and I now count myself amongst the many others! who cla im to have seen such strange things in the skies... The funny thing is, I was watching another TV show about UFO's, and they were talking about all of the Gulf Breeze (which is right next to P-Cola) activity from a while back.. and in one of the many pictures they showed that had been taken by a witness, was a picture of pretty much what we saw that day, but they got a shot of all 4 objects together... hhhhmmmm???;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
Bright sphere with contrasting shadows traveling slowly from north to south from 8-11o'clock positions diagonally;2007-04-27 19:30:00;10 minutes;Bright sphere with contrasting shadows traveling slowly from north to south from 8-11o'clock positions diagonally This photo was taken at approximately 19:30 local time while sitting outside with my family here in Pensacola Fl. I often scan the skies for anything interesting, and I noticed what appeared to be a distant and slow moving object at about the 10 o'clock position traveling from north to south. I went inside to get my Kodak P712 digital camera, which has a 10x optical zoom lens, hoping to get a better look. Upon, returning I did not see the object, and thought it might have passed behind a cloud.  I sat back down to enjoy the sunset, and after a few minutes a bright pinpoint of light caught my eye off to my left as it continued moving slowly south through a clear patch of sky at about the 11 o'clock position. I could see the bright spot very clearly, and was able to point it out to my 5 year old son. My wife, who was also present, did not see it she had been facing the opposite direction.  I momentarily lost sight of it while readying my camera, but decided to snap some photos of the area anyway. I was very pleased when one of them captured the object. My only regret was that the camera was set to 3.1-mega pixels instead of its maximum of 7.2-mega pixels. The object was definitely three dimensional, and traveling at a slight upwards angle as it moved from north to south.  A friend of mine once said that he did not believe in UFO’s, and if they were real, how come he had never seen one? My only question to him was “How often do you look up”?;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
Orange sphere with two blue spheres attached, moving west to east, Pensacola Florida.;2009-05-17 00:50:00;5 seconds;Orange sphere with two blue spheres attached, moving west to east, Pensacola, Florida. I was outside and I noticed something out of the corner of my eye.  I looked up to the sky, and saw a glowing object traveling west to east.  It was round or rather it was a larger sphere with two smaller spheres on the bottom.  It was totally silent.  The larger sphere glowed orange, and the smaller spheres were blue.  It was not a plane, and it did not look like any meteor I ever saw.  It moved too quietly and too fast for a plane, and too slowly to be a meteor.  The orange glow was very distinct.  The two smaller spheres on its bottom were too large for aircraft lights and were not flashing or bright enough. As I said, the object traveled west to east, low in the sky.  It wasn’t tiny, nor was it large.  It was much larger than a meteor.  It was not a fireball.  The glow seemed to come from inside the sphere.  It didn’t leave any trail there was no sound, and no electrical malfunctions at my house.   When the object passed over me, and was east of me, it completely disappeared. It wasn’t far enough away to have been out of viewing range.  It was there and gone.  Just like that.    I stood outside a while to see if there was any more activity, but I saw nothing else except for flashes of light from a thunderstorm far to the east-southeast. This is the second time I have seen a UFO in the past 4 months.  The other one disappeared, then reappeared, then disappeared again.  I hoped this one would reappear, but it did not. It was just before 1 am central time.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349

We witnessed three orange lights in the sky over Pensacola.;2013-07-25 22:05:00;1 minute;We witnessed three orange lights in the sky over Pensacola. Travelling east on Hwy 90 in Pensacola, my husband and I noticed 3 orange spheres in the sky above the road.  Initially, they were in a triangular pattern with two up front and one distanced slightly to the rear.  We commented that it was odd to see three aircraft that close together in the night sky.  As they passed across the road, the objects separated and split off in three different directions.  I managed to keep my focus on the one that was south of the highway completely losing sight of the other two objects.  The single orange ball of light appeared to pass over a nearby residential area and hover. It stayed in that position until we drove on, and it was no longer visible. My husband is a merchant marine, and I am a teacher.   We do live in the vicinity of the airport and a military base.   Upon returning home, I researched the color patterns of navagational lights on different aircraft and I found no match for what we saw.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
