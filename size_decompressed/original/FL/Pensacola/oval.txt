Pensacola, FL- a space craft of immese size appeared without sound;1978-06-01 19:00:00;10-15 minutes;Pensacola, FL- a space craft of immese size appeared without sound In the spring-summer of 1978, my best friend and I were driving on Interstate 10 in Pensacola. We were heading East to Santa Rosa County. The sun had gone down as we traveled on Interstate 10. As I was driving, I was close to the water tower that is on the interstate which is just before the bridge going over Escambia Bay.  All of a sudden and out of nowhere, a space ship was suspended over the interstate before the bridge. There was no sound eminating from the spacecraft however, it was extremely large almost covering the width of the interstate.  Also, it was vast in height in comparison to a five or six-story building.  Underneath the craft, the structure seemed to be comprised of steel girders with a circular area in the middle of the bottom of the spacecraft. It was lit up so that one could see the structural design of the craft. The main superstructure was very large with colored panels lighting up at times. I recall a red, blue or green, and yellow panel lit up as if the space craft was tying to communicate something using color and the sequence of when the panels lit up. There was no sound coming from this sighting. It was just suspended in space. It was so close to my friend and me. Then all of a sudden the lights went out and in total darkness and without sound, the craft moved over the water tower. It was hovering over the tower when out of the circular area located at the bottom of the craft, a light shown down on the water tower. It was as if the light was searching the tower and nearby land where the tower was built. Again, the lights went out and without and trace of sound, the spacecraft moved a little west and farther into the sky. Again, it was suspended in the sky and the only lights eminating from it were white lights. If I am not mistaken, the lights seemed to be outlining the perimeter of the spacecraft. It has been several years since my friend and I saw this sighting. If I am not mistaken, once the craft had allowed us to see the white lights surrounding the perimeter, it fled in an amazing speed towards the southeast. That was an incredible evening for both my friend and me. Once arriving to my home, excitedly, he and I ran into the house sharing this information with my parents. I called the local newspaper and radio station(s) explaining what we had seen and asked if anyone had seen the same thing to please get in touch with me. However, as was in a lot of cases back in the 70's, the receiver(s) of my inquiries laughed in unbelief. Today, I know this sighting was real. I don't have to prove anything to anyone to the reality of this matter because I, as well as my friend, know what we saw was truth. I only wish I could have communicated with the intellectuality of the spacecraft to understand more. But yet, maybe another time will take place so that intelligence can share and learn from other sources within the universe.

Oval shape UFO over Pensacola;2008-09-28 21:30:00;2 mins;Oval shape UFO over Pensacola I was going to a park to walk about 9:45pm. Looking into the sky i saw 3 lights, thinking it was a plane. We have an airport very close. The plane seemed very low and as i got closer i notice it wasn't moving. I saw what seemed to be an oval shape with 3 lights kinda just floating. I turn down a side street to get a closer look and it was gone.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349

Saw dark object which i originally discredited as a stray branch or wildlife slightly above the treeline. object began to move around in an unnatural way, and a shooting star like object seemed to launch from its left side, disappearing below the treeline out of sight. after a few more movements, dark UFO passed overhead and moved beyond roof. aside from unknown projectile from object, no lights were visible. was only able to notice the object because it was much darker than surrounding night sky.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349

Metallic UFO above Pensacola Florida;2020-10-10 18:00:00;2 hours;Metallic UFO above Pensacola Florida First thought to be a white or silver balloon but as we watched it over the course of an hour it appeared to be above the clouds or at least most of them, A hurricane had just missed us but we had maybe 30 mile per hour winds still moving the clouds along and this object remained where it wanted to be up and down appearing to get closer to the ground or maybe chnnging its shape because the clouds always were under it and we only lost sight once the sun went down.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
