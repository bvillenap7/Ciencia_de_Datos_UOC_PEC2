Chevron shaped lights slowly moving south to north.;2003-04-10 23:15:00;30 sec;Chevron shaped lights slowly moving south to north. I was out on my back porch finishing a cigarette and watching the low lying moving clouds when I noticed a triangle pattern of dull white lights moving south to north. There were approximately 9 total lights in a triangular formation or V shape with another semi triangular row behing the front row of lights. The second row of lights appeared to move about slightly but stayed in a gereral formation with the front row. The lights moved overhead just above the lower lying thin layer of clouds with no sound whatsoever. I looked for light tracer beams from below to see if it was possible beams of light from the ground but there was no trace. These lights appeared to be relatively low and just above the lowest stata of cold-front clouds in the night sky and moving in the opposite direction of the clouds.

Another boomerage shaped craft during lunar eclispe;2003-11-08 19:00:00;10 seconds;Another boomerage shaped craft during lunar eclispe My girlfriend and I had stepped outside behind the house to observe the lunar eclipse. While standing there for several minutes, we were looking towards the east at the moon which was at the time at about 45 degrees.  I suddenly noticed something out of the corner of my eyes to the upper left above my house. I gave a short look and didn't notice anything, then I caught site of a 'boomerage/chevron' shaped object, it appeared to be very light grey/silver in color and I did notice lights running along the front perimeter of the object.  I told my girlfriend to look, she did but couldn't locate the object as I tried to point it out.  The object seemed to disappear like a sci-fi ship using a cloaking device.  I was able to make a good visual contact that I am certain of what I saw, but it happened for only a 10 second time frame.  I did not hear any noise, nor could I accurately determine the size but other to guesstimate it about the size of a small passenger jet,i.e. Canadair CL-600. I believe it was only illuminated due to ground lights from area homes, business, street lights, other wise, it was impossible to see. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate, although the eclipse did occor on November 08, 2003.  Hence, date probably is correct.  PD));30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
