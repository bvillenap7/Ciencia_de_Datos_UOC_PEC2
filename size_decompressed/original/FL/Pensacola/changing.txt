Shapshifting white lights moving over Pensacola Pier;2009-06-16 21:15:00;2 minutes;Shapshifting white lights moving over Pensacola Pier My girlfriend and I were sitting on Pensacola Beach about 100 yards to the left of the pier.  We were at the beach for bands on the beach that happens every Tuesday night.  It was dark outside and therefore no sunlight left in the sky.  As I was talking to my girlfriend, looking over the gulf, I noticed what looked like a slow moving  white cloud that was very hard to see about 200-300 yards out over the water.  It was awkward because it was the only one in the sky and seemed to be moving in a smooth and slow motion.   My girlfriend then noticed it and we began to watch the object as it moved east, then stopped, and started moving west.  We both watched as the object stopped near the end of the pier, and then seemed to turn and move over the pier.  When first passing over the pier, the lights from the pier, which were orange in color, seemed to reflect from the front of this object.  As it moved over the pier, it was still very hard to see and determine its full shape.  After reaching the end of the pier it was in a closer proximity to me.  I could see what looked to be very small and dim lights moving north to onshore.  These lights were in the general shape of a triangle or boomerang.  The shape was constantly changing though, as we watched the object move further onshore, the object(s) began to conform to more of a ball-shape.   Then the object(s) seemed to vanish. It didnâ€™t speed off, but was just gone.   The entire movement of this object was slow.   There was never any noise emitted from this object.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
White orb triangular craft followed us.;2013-03-12 22:00:00;30+ minutes;white orb triangular craft followed us. I was leaving the house to take my girlfriend to work.  As we got to the end of our street I looked directly across the street and up.  About 50-80ft above the tree I saw three white orbs in triangular formation very close together.  It moved suddenly then stopped, it then shifted shapes and took on a form similar to a helicopters light pattern.  One of the lights even changed to a flickering red.  It started moving to our right before we even turned.  I proceeded to take my girlfriend to work which is in the same direction. Never taking an eye off it I turned as well.  I didn't put my blinker on for my next left turn. My gf keeping an eye on it the entire time, noticed that the craft turned back to our direction.We really got freaked after this.  Once the craft was back over us it started circling our vehicle as we went down the road.  It was following us.  At one point it shifted back into the all white three orb triangle, then back to the helicopter form before the nex! t main road.  We turned off our normal route and into the Wal-Mart parking lot and parked for about 13 mins watching it make a wider circle around the area.  We left the parking lot and got back on route.  Back on top of us circling again making every turn we make.My gf tells me she's not going to work to just keep driving.  We end up across town and rush into a friend's house.  Watching his surveillance cameras we watched the craft split into sections and one stayed visible on screen flickering and moving slightly.  We stayed there about three hours before we got the nerve to leave.  Once we came outside the craft vanished. We made it home with out being followed.  As far as we know.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349

Strange shaped lighted beings appeared on video camera footage.;2020-06-11 12:57:00;10 minutes;Strange shaped lighted beings appeared on video camera footage. Looking through camera footage that a resident said someone was outside their unit we just found all of the footage of strange shaped lights and then a larger light that seemed to project light below it on the ground and seemed to control the smaller lights.  I have sent 2 emails with 3 videos each because the footage was too long and large to send otherwise.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
