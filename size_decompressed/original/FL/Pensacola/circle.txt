It was night..  no rain ..No clouds .. We saw 3 craft  came out of nowhere hovering above us  in a triangle pattern .. they were . I would say .. 4,000 - 8,000 ft ?  ... They were big ... I would guess the 3/4 the size of a football field each .. All you could see of the ship was a round light ... Not super bright .. You could look strait at it ... But still pretty bright ..This light lit up the area like moon light at three times the light ... But no extra heat ... And no sound at all ... The wind moved only slightly ... But a strange thing ... I will always remember ..I could shout in your ear and you would hear a whisper .. They stayed above us for 3 to 8 min.  .. Then you just saw streaks of light curve up to space .. and like that  they were gone ... ((name and e-address deleted))    Pensacola , Fl.    32507 ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Circle of light travels through cloud, leaving a wake, in under to seconds to out of view.;2006-04-15 21:00:00;2 Seconds;Circle of light travels through cloud, leaving a wake, in under to seconds to out of view. Felt as if I were being watched, looked N, W, S for 2 minutes, when I looked E-Zenith, I saw it. The second I saw it, in under 2 seconds it moved out of view leaving a wake in the clouds. Estimated size was half that of a boeing 747. This is assumed by cloud height and size at the time. It was pure white circle of light.  After the sighting, an large fear overcame me, I ran inside and armed myself with my weapons...;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
saw large bright light in wsw sky as well as 3 reddish orange pulsating orbs in southern sky;2009-01-21 18:45:00;1 hour;saw large bright light in wsw sky as well as 3 reddish orange pulsating orbs in southern sky I returned home from shopping and let our three dogs outside at approximately 645pm. I brought them back inside and realized that I had left some items in the car. I went back outside and noticed a very bright light in the WSW above a nearby treeline. I kept looking at it trying to figure out what it might be. I live across the street from a Navy helicopter training field, so I am very familiar with their sights and sounds, but it would have been too late for them to be flying anyway. It wasn't a plane- it had no blinking lights and did not move like one. It had fringes of red on the left and right sides and what appeared to be moonbeams eminating from it. It moved very slowly towards the south. I called my neighbors (to my west) on the phone and asked them to step outside and see if they witness what I was seeing. We stood in their front yard and watched it move away to the south. We watched it for approximately 10 minutes and they went back inside (since the temperature was around 30 degrees). I came back inside my home and thought about what I was seeing. I went back outside and it was still there, but lower in the sky. I went over to my neighbors (to my east), and they stepped outside into the street and also saw it. We watched it for a few minutes, and they went back inside their home. My neighbor (to the east) went online to see if there were any stars that were supposed to be visible, and I told them I would talk to them later to find out. I went back home at this point. At about 730pm, I went back outside to see if the light was still in the sky, but it had disappeared. I walked back over to my neighbors (to the east) to see if she had found out anything on the internet, and as I knocked on their door, I turned towards the SWS, looking over the helicopter training field towards Perdido Bay. I saw three orangish-red pulsating orbs. Two of them were close together, and the third was further to the west. At this point, I noticed that the orbs were fading out slowly, then would reappear in a different spot. They did this independently of each other. My neighbors came to their door and as we stood in their driveway, we all witnessed the orbs fading out then reappearing, moving westerly. They started appearing closer together. One would fade out, and then the other two would fade out. The whole episode lasted approximately two minutes before the orbs disappeared completely. We noticed that air traffic in the area picked up considerably during both episodes- more than usual. There was a distinct difference between the bright light and orbs versus the planes and helicpters that started appearing. My neighbor did say that Scorpius would have been the brightest star in the western sky, but when we came out to look for it, it was no longer there- with no explanation where it disappeared. The bright white light was no star. The three pulsating orbs were not stars. I'm not sure what we all saw last night.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
two very bright balls of light in night sky following each other. No sound and no flashing lights moving very slowly.;2009-11-28 18:00:00;3 mins;two very bright balls of light in night sky following each other. No sound and no flashing lights moving very slowly. On November 28, 2009 at about 6:00 pm I looked up in the n/ne sky and noticed two round very bright balls of light. At first I thought it was the international space station but there was two of them. One was following the other. The one in back was a little bit smaller than the one in front. They was very close to each other.There was no sound and no lights were flashing to indicate an aircraft of some kind. I watched them as they went behind some trees and one came out and the other didn't. The one continued on toward the s/se until I could not see it anymore.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
Eight round lights over Pensacola for one hour.;2016-09-03 04:45:00;1 hour;eight round lights over pensacola for one hour appx 445 am I was outside having coffee. I looked to the east near the airport and noticed 4 bright round lights. At the time there was a thunderstorm. But as I watched the lights they were flying around up, down sideways hovering in air with no movement then they would go into for different directions. I got my husband up and saw exactly what was going on. It was like watching fire flies. This went on for appx one hour , Also there were four other lights that formed a small triangle and they flew together and then they went straight up and gone. I thought it was over then another four lights due east of the airport came together and it was like they were dancing in the sky. could not video my phone does not do good pics. I watched this until 545 am the sun was coming up and the light show was over. I called the news and our local airport to tell them about these round lights. plus there was no noise;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349

I spotted an unidentified flying object while filming a Blue Angels flyby formation at the NAS Pensacola Airshow (November 9, 2019). The object looks like a rotating ring, is moving very fast, and has two visible lights. The object appears for 5 seconds in the recorded video. After a little research, it looks like a similar looking object was spotted in South Carolina just a week prior to the Florida airshow.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
