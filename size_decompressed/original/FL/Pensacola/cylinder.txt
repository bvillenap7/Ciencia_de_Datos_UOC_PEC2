3 orange/red upright cylinders moving south then turned west.;2013-09-28 19:45:00;5 minutes;3 orange/red upright cylinders moving south then turned west About 7:45pm, Saturday night, I was on my patio and noticed three (3) lights that appeared to be in a single line (formation – one behind the other equally spaced) heading south, towards town.   As they got closer to our house, their appearance became more apparent. They were upright cylinders that glowed orange & red.  Almost looked like lamp shades that were moving straight and the light glowed/oscillated orange and red.   They didn’t seem to be moving at a high rate of speed (not as fast as most airplanes as they approach our home and go beyond to the airport).  When they got about a mile or so away, the first object turned west and the other two followed however, they seemed to take the exact route, i.e. they didn’t turn as soon as the first, but they made it to the same location as the first and then turned west to follow.  They seemed to stay at equal distances from one another.   As they headed West we lost sight of each one (the first one first, down to the third).   But it didn’t seem as though it went so far that we lost sight it was as if it just turned its light out when it reached a certain point.  And the other two did the same at about the same point in space.  I looked around for the next hour and never saw them again.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
