Six orange glowing diamond shaped objects in two separate clusters due east of Pensacola;2006-10-11 20:45:00;1 hour;Six orange glowing diamond shaped objects in two separate clusters due east of Pensacola At first I thought it was fireworks, then I saw them again.  More distinct the second time as the three round/diamond shaped orange objects moved slowly up with glowing tails behind them.  It really reminded me of the shuttle explosion as it reentered Earth only these were going up, not down to the horizon.  I lost view of them as I was driving.  Twenty minutes later, they appeared again, this time in two clusters.  I called my parents for them to witness it.  Mom walked out her front door to see them glowing due east.  When I walked up to her house, I noticed she was looking at a different set than I was and this time they were not moving quite as much as before and seemed larger.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
