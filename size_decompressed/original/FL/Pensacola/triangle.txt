Replicating triangle light patterns over I-10 in Florida;2003-10-23 22:30:00;5 minutes;Replicating triangle light patterns over I-10 in Florida Driving in Florida on I-10 heading west at about 10:30PM at approximately mile marker 90, my wife and I observed a bright, fairly dense (10 to 15 individual lights), stationary, triangular formation of white lights appear in the sky ahead (west) of our car. Another identical pattern appeared just north-east of the initial object and the first object faded.  This pattern repeated to the north-east two more times and then disappeared completely.  Within a minute or two the pattern started again.  This time the pattern was moving in the south-east direction. Being close to Eglin Airforce Base, I assumed these were heat-seeking missle avoidance flare tests.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349

One was triangle shaped and the other cyllinder. I only glimpsed these a moment before the lights faded out. The second time I saw them was less than a minute later, not far up the road, the same to sets of lights. They lasted about 30 seconds and then also faded out. I picked my fiance up and we headed home. about 1 1/2 miles from my fiance's work on the same road the same set of lights again appeared behind us and I pointed them out to my fiance. My 2 children also in the car turned around and also saw them. This time they were over a baseball field and lasted about 45-55 seconds before fading out. We all agreed they couldn't be flares or fire, the shape was too perfect and didn't shift at all while we watched. (This happened in Pensacola, FL on 9 mile rd. the road was fairly busy and others had to have seen the lights as well.);30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349

I saw on a cloudy night 7 independent yellowish lights that were moving together forming the letter V 3 lights where on each side and one was leading. They moved slowly but much more faster than an airplane. While flying they moved softly from left to right, always forming the letter V. They passed on top of my head and then kept moving North. It never stopped or dissapear, I just couldn't see anymore because of the buildings.;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
Black triangle craft flying low wilts trees.;2010-10-05 02:00:00;2 or 3 minutes;Black Triangle Craft flying low wilts trees. It was about 2 am my lights inside my mobile homed started to dim & to the point of such a low power state I could hardly see inside the home.  I went outside to see & check power pole & noticed street lights were at same power state, so low that they went off.   Living out in the woods where I lived there are several other homes & mobile homes on the street.  Normally a lot of dogs in the area always barking, with the woody area, & river close by, frogs and other noise makers as usuall.  Well this night was different, all went quite I mean nothing was making noise & if it was, it all stopped.  When I noticed a slight hum, a very weird hum, like a washing machine on spin dry but not that loud.   When I looked up I could see a dark object, triangle in shape, huge!  I would say football field lenght in size. No lights, no blinkin lights, nothing.  The only reason I saw it was because the moon was not quite halffull when it got blocked out of view & stars as well.  Moving slowly from east to west towards the perdido river.  My girlfriend, her brother & myself all seen this.  Not sure if anyone else in the area did.  I reported this to MUFON, I guess a week later.   Well a month went by when I took vacation from work & was barbequing on grill late afternoon I noticed the strangest damn thing.  All the tops of the trees, about the same width of the triangle thing we saw, had turned brownish & wilted, more wilted than brown, you could see the pine trees just looked sick like if u don't water a plant enuff or you water the leaves & put it in the hot sun & they wilt.  But it was fall so no way it was from weather.  2 days into my vacaction, 3 vehicles come cruising down the road which dead ends & we all know each other so veh not from residents, 1 humvee, & 2 chevy suv's all with white gov.  Plates.   They got out, took pics of trees, that I saw as well.. they where in the area for about 2 hours. I went up to the two that got out of the suv they were dressed in blue coveralls like flight suit lookin military clothin! g no nam es on clothes but patches on side on velcro lookin spot on upper arm what looked to be lighting bolts with I think a missile between the bolts, I think the numbers were 38th, at least that's what I think it was.  Anyway I asked them are they here because of the low flying craft 3 or 4 weeks ago?  They looked at each other & told me what craft, I went on explaining what I saw and what i thought caused the trees to welt.  They told me no that's not what caused it & it was a fuel release from an aircraft that had problems, which was a damn lie cause fuel would have been all over the trees falling from sky not a straight line.  I didn't argue with them of course & they asked me my name & address & who all was with me, & I'm like why would u guys want to know all this if it was a fuel release from airplane? They said In case of sickness or medical complications they told me.  But why didn't they ask rest of neighborhood? Some guy called me from MUFON about 6 months ago but not sure if he was who he said he was.. I never saw the military guys again, just 2 helicopters flying over area checking out the same area, I really wish I could have got a photo from the air to see the distance that this thing made because it was 3 streets in lenght from ground view and some.  maybe 1/2 mile of wilted tree tops 80 to 100 yards wide..it was crazy..  I mean craziest thing I have ever seen! I wonder how they knew who else was with me that night, that's the other thing that really bothers me..;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349

It was cloudy, but in between the clouds was a strange shaped dark object that stood out from both the fore and background. it looked to be triangular, with four prismatic lights at the bottom/back of the craft, along with two towards the center edges of it, and one more by the nose of the craft. It faded out of sight as the clouds became thicker for a moment, and was no longer present when the clouds cleared once again;30.4486742857143;-87.2573950649349
