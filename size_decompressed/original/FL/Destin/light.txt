Lights in sky above gulf waters in Destin, FL;2004-09-01 22:00:00;3 minutes;Lights in sky above gulf waters in Destin, FL Last year my husband and I took our 1 year old son on vacation to Destin, FL.  My father was also vacationing with us.  It was during the last week of August, right before Labor Day weekend.  One night, after putting our son to bed, about 10:00pm, I walked out onto the balcony and looked out over the gulf waters.  In the sky, there were two round lights.  They were white & amber colored, kind of like far away headlights.  As a matter of fact, that's exactly what I thought they were...plane headlights, really close ones.  But they weren't getting any closer.  They weren't moving at all.  I called my dad and husband out to the balcony to take a look, but then they were gone.  They just disappeared in the exact same spot they had appeared in.  All the while, there were no sounds except the tiny waves that make it into the gulf. All of this transpired in 45-60 seconds.  About 60 seconds went by, and  right after my dad & husband made it onto the balcony, the lights re-appeared in the exact same spot.  At first just the two of them came back.  Then, as my dad, husband and I stood looking at these two lights, another one appeared to the right and just slightly above the others.  Then another one to the right and slightly above that one.  And then another.  So, now, there were five lights with the first two being side-by-side and the other three extending up & out to the right in a diagonal line.  Still, I could hear no sound except the calm ocean.  After watching these lights appear and stay lit for about 40 seconds, I turned to run inside and get my camera.  As I went through the sliding glass door, I looked behind me, afraid that the lights would be gone.  Just as I turned and looked at them, they faded to black and I could no longer see them.  I did not get a picture.  We sat on the balcony for a few more hours, until about 12:00 midnight.  We sat out there talking about what we had seen and looking out over the gulf, waiting for the lights to come back, but they never did.  Now, I'm not sure what we really saw out there.  I know that Eglin AFB is really close to this area.  Maybe the lights had to do with that.  Also, maybe there was a ship way out there in the gulf that we couldn't see, with air craft taking off from it.  I guess maybe, we'll never know.  However, if anyone out there knows what it could have been, or has seen something similar, any information would be greatly appreciated.;30.3954416666667;-86.4708333333334
6 orange lights over Destin, FL;2007-07-13 19:00:00;6 seconds;6 orange lights over Destin, FL My Dad and I were sitting in our high-rise condo we rented in San Destin Resorts in Destin, FL. Over a huge lake, I saw bright orange light flash. It quickly went out and a second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth light soon flashed consecutively. The lights moved from about a 7:00 position to 1:00 position diagonally. There were either 6 separate lights, or one light that blinked or left a trail. All of the lights were the same small orange light. The six lights lasted about 2 seconds.  Then about 2 seconds later, I saw six lights again do the same exact thing in the same pattern about 10 miles away from the lake over the city.  After this set of 6 lights, I did not see it again. It was obviously not an airplane because it was moving extremely fast and went in a diagonal line from bottom-left to bottom-right.;30.3954416666667;-86.4708333333334

5 stationary lights suspended above the ground North of Highway 98 in Destin, Fl. then disappearing one by one.;2010-03-12 21:00:00;4-5 minutes;5 stationary lights suspended above the ground North of Highway 98 in Destin, Fl. then disappearing one by one. My wife and I were driving back to our condo just after eating out.  We were eastbound on Hwy 98 in Destin, Fl. Having just left the restaurant which is at 21000 Emerald coast highway.  After driving about a half mile east, I happened to notice a series of lights to the north of the highway, hanging in the sky.  They were quite bright and stationary, so I thought they were probably some outdoor stadium lights.  They literally lit up the bottoms of some low clouds that were passing above them.  That’s when I realized they weren’t stadium lights, since they wouldn’t have projected upwards.  My wife also saw them and thought they were lights on top of a hill, then realized that there are no hills around here and wondered what they were.  When I saw them, there were three lights, when she saw them, there were two , but then.another showed up to form a triangular light pattern, then two more showed up below and to the west of the first group.  We continued to drive east and talked about them.  At first I thought they were helicopters with their front lights on,  but as we drove along, they got neither closer nor farther away and also seemed suspended in one spot relative to one another.  Also, there was no familiar sound such as 5 helicopters would have made.  Here in Destin, helicopters are flying around all the time and there is no such thing as a silent flight of them.  We continued to drive east, discussing what they might or might not be……all the time they were just hanging in the sky.  Finally we came to an intersection about two miles away at Matthew Road where I could pull off, which I did and turned into the parking lot of a service station.  I grabbed our FLIP camera, rolled down the window and started filming them.  Shortly after that, the lights began dimming, one by one, till they were gone from the sky as shown on the video.  Some observations that are not apparent from the video:  The lights were VERY bright, lighting up the bottom of the clouds more than is apparent in the video  They were absolutely stationary relative to our position, even though we drove over two miles on the ground as we observed them.  The lights were also sharper and better defined than on the video.     That’s about it.  We leave the rest of it up to you.;30.3954416666667;-86.4708333333334

My fiance told me to look at the strange star.  I turned and initially believed it to be an aircraft, and told him so.  We watched it and realized it was not moving in any direction, but rather seemed to be hovering, and spinning.  Imagine someone facing you with a flashlight, then slowly turning away so you see less and less of the light, until it is completely facing away from you, and you see nothing.  Then coming back around and facing you.  It has been doing this for over half an hour now, and the only movement detecable besides the circle seems to be very slight vertical movement.;30.3954416666667;-86.4708333333334

UFO over Holiday Isle in Destin.;2019-07-28 02:30:00;15 minutes;UFO over Holiday Isle in Destin. I was sitting on my balcony at Holiday Isle on the Gulf as I couldn't sleep.  Saw a bright white light that was pulsing high up in the sky.  Thought it was possibly a planet.  Watched for 15 minutes as it hovered and stayed in place until it started moving east at a slow rate then shot off and disappeared.  I have video.;30.3954416666667;-86.4708333333334
