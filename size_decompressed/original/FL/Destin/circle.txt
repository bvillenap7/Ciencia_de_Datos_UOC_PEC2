Large  (circular view with possible oval side)object with sophistacted lighting system hovered and moved over ocean (Gulf of Mexico);2003-11-24 19:00:00;45 min.+;Large  (circular view with possible oval side)object with sophistacted lighting system hovered and moved over ocean (Gulf of Mexico) While on the 15th floor balcony of a condo where I was vacationing  at Sandestin Golf an Beach Resort I noticed a particularly bright star and curiously took the video cam out to attempt to gain a better look at it by using the zoom in feature. I saw that it wasn't a star, but an unusual flying craft with extremely sophisticated light patterns, appearing circular in shape, although a slight side glimpse indicated it may have been obelisk from another angle. I proceeded to tape the object for approx a half hour, obtaining approx.23 minutes of unusual footage, some very detailed. It was high over the ocean the entire time.;30.3954416666667;-86.4708333333334

3 objects looked like a fire in the sky;2010-03-12 21:10:00;10 minutes;3 objects looked like a fire in the sky We saw something that looked like a really bright light, like a fire in the sky, so we walked down the side walk and it was 3 objects, that were just staying in the same spot with really bright lights flashing, one disapeared then reappeared, then we heard a big boom like it was a bomb that the base usually test. the neighbor came out because his friend called him and told him to go look at the sky, im sure alot of people saw it, then they all of a sudden just vanished, and we didnt see anything else. We live very close to military bases, after they went away now there are search helicopters (probably military ones) flying. We got it on video.  We called the local sheriff station and they said they and eglin airforce base are awar of the event and eglin has it under control, it was probably a flare, but flares do not just stay in one spot they go up then fall down, it was the brightest flahing lights ive ever seen in the sky;30.3954416666667;-86.4708333333334

White object same size as the moon hovers across the sky, passes the moon and begins to flicker red.;2014-05-01 22:00:00;~10 minutes;White object same size as the moon hovers across the sky, passes the moon and begins to flicker red. 	Late at night on the street me, my little brother and a close friend lived on. We were walking home because we were out much later than our parents allowed. While in the cul-de-sac my little brother told us to look at the sky. The sky was almost completely clear. 	Close to the moon there was a hazy, circular object glowing white, about 2/3 the (relative) size of the moon. It slowly crossed the sky directly toward the moon, and shortly after passing the moon it began to faintly flicker light red. By then we were rushing home because it terrified us. 	After my brother and I got home we had told our mom, but when we all went outside together (~10 minutes later) we saw nothing, and I was grounded for staying out late.;30.3954416666667;-86.4708333333334
