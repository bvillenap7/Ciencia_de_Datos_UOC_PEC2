So I go out to do some Tai Chi down the beach.I get pretty far out there and stop to take in the scene.I notice a rounded,rectangular light in the sky.At first I thought it was the top of a tower,but soon realized it was out over the bay,maybe 300-400 feet up.It had a dark spot that rotated around the light.As I watched it,I noticed a small blinking light come into the picture.At first I thought it was a plane in the far distance,but as it got near the UFO,it looked like a small object that came very close to the UFO. As the blinking light passed by,the UFO made a unnaturaly smooth descent off past the buildings on the horizion.It was so low I thought it would have to had crashed into the buildings,but,never heard or saw anything else from it.|What was very freaky though,is that,on my way back down the beach to my car,there were a bunch(about 11)Blue Herrons(a type of tall skinny bird) all lined up at the waters edge looking out tword where the incident took place.In all my life living in the gulf coast area,ive never seen these birds in a group like that.They were spread out down the beach when I was on my way out there as well.There was also about 3 helicopters in the area at the time.This location is very close to several military bases. Anyone driving across the Destin bridge at this time would have had an even better view than me of the UFO.There was pretty heavy traffic.I hope this report can help with anything.;30.3954416666667;-86.4708333333334
