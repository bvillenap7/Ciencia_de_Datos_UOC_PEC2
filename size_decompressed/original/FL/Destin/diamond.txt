They were above the clouds in the night sky. I need to know the cloud ceiling to givr the objets hight. As I was watching the objects they kept turning into themself and making high degree turns. Than three objects came away from the main group avd flew directly west staying in a tringal formation. Thats when I knew that they were not night time birds. They all had the same color and shined the same way. They had a dimond shape and were bright white. In the main group there could have been upto 20-25. My friend saw objects break away and fly south over the Gulf of Mexice\o but I did not see this as I keep my eyes on the main group. you can call me if you have any questions my name is ((name and phone number deleted));30.3954416666667;-86.4708333333334
