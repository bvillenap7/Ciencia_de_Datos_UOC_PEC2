On or about 6/2011 around 2:30 to 3amC.S.T. i was traveling east bound on u.s.hwy 98 when i looked to my left across the west bound lane into the woods and noticed green light emulating from the woods, the first thing i thought was what is a shrimp boat doing in the woods because of the green lights. I looked for the next place i could do a 180 to have a closer look.as i got closer i could tell that the lights were round.I parked my truck on the side of the hwy. and there was about a 3 foot embankment i walked down to get a closer look. My ex wife got out of the truck but stayed next to it.  As i walked down the small embankment and got closer approx.40 yards i stopped and noticed five lights a little smaller than swimming pool lights emitting a light green light.there was approx.3 to 4 feet of space in between the lights that was totally blacked out,also about 3to 5 feet above the first green light closest to me was a 6th light that was more intense and emitting! a bright orange color as i took another step or two closer,the orange light got brighter at the same time my ex told me not to get to close,it was almost as if the orange light was warning me not to approach any closer so i stopped in my tracks and just stared at this craft,something made me look up into the trees above the craft and i will attempt to explain what i saw.What looked to me like thousands of darker green laser lights were shining like laser lights thru every open space between pine needles and oak leaves and as God is my wittness in the dark green laser beam lights going up these lights rather slowly were what appeared to be minute bubbles or tiny metal flakes going up,not down in these laser like beams,as i looked back at the five round lights i noticed that the black out between the lights was so blacked out that you could see that it was blocking out the trees behind it only up to the height of the lights and that if the craft had turned all it's lights of! f it would have been next to impossible to know it was there e! xcept fo r the fact that it blocked out the shape of the trees up to 5 or 6 feet above the ground,i took 1 step closer to get a better look and the orange light jumped up another notch in intensity so i went back to my truck to see if i could flag some one down and there was no traffic.What i would have given to have had a camcorder that night.Ive often wondered what would have happened if i would have stayed until the sun came up.Would it have taken off or would it have simply slowly disapeared as the sun came up.;30.3954416666667;-86.4708333333334
