Object with an array of white lights;2005-07-03 08:30:00;4 minutes;We saw in the sky, an object with an array of white lights on it it flying west to east at about 50 miles an hour. The light were in rows, there were 2 or 3 rows of lights. There was also a blinking light I believe.;30.3954416666667;-86.4708333333334
Large mirror-like object in the sky suddenly disappears during the daytime;2006-04-23 11:00:00;1 minute;Large mirror-like object in the sky suddenly disappears during the daytime Around 11:00 AM my daughter and I went for a walk. Suddenly we both noticed an extremely bright object in the sky. We could not make out the shape because it was so bright...almost as if it was a large mirror. It was stationary and then it moved forward very quickly and disappeared. There were large full clouds scattered throughout the sky in between large areas of clear blue sky. In the location of the UFO it was very clear and there were no clouds close by for it to disappear into.;30.3954416666667;-86.4708333333334

I race off road dirt bikes and was checking the weather report for the Madison, Florida area on March 7, 2008, at 4:40 pm ET. I was looking to see if the area was going to get some rain since we as a whole hate it when a race is dusty. I found this radar image that one can find on www.weather .com.   I put the map in motion and there was a section of movement that had this “straight line”, in like two or three frames. It caught my eye and I was like what the heck was that, so I paused the motion and advanced it frame by frame till the image came up. I say a straight line cause it was more straight than a cloud clearing of sorts, and low and behold there is this line that looks as if something flew through the cloud and made a trail. The end of the trail is round and looks as if the clouds move away from the end in uniform distance.  I first thought that it must be a jet fighter or something coming out of the military base, that I think is up there, but then I start to think about the scale of which the radar image is covering. It is this thought that makes me wonder to myself what I have I have a picture of, I mean the radar image is in the middle of the slider scale which scans in and out from I guess  city view all the out to multiple counties.  I have the scale in the middle when I printed the image. I have shown it to friends and no one has a clue as to what it might be. I know weather can take on any form and it can take shapes that make us as people go huh, but this image is, in my opinion not a clearing of natural origin, but more of a picture of a wake so to speak. I would be happy to email a picture of it if can get it to scan clearly. Well in conclusion, it could be said that it is an airplane, but some one would have to prove to me the scale of the radar image is that small and show me other weather radar pictures of airplanes that have been imaged and recorded.  I feel for know that this is an unidentifiable flying object that has been picked up on a weather radar loop swing. Other questions that cross my mind are 1) how fast does a radar loop move and how many frames does it take to make one loop swing. This entire image lasted for three frames at most, before it was not visible in the radar loop  in motion. Thanks and get back to me via my email if you would like to see the printed out color copy of the image;30.3954416666667;-86.4708333333334
Solo rotating hovering light, second sighting in as many days.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a star??  PD));2011-09-13 22:00:00;unknown;Solo rotating hovering light, second sighting in as many days. This is my 2nd report.  I went outside tonight sporadically, looking for my ufo again tonight.  Up until around 10:30pm (central time) I saw nothing, then BAM, it was there again, same time as last night, same place as last night, doing the same thing.  Charging video camera tonight to get footage tomorrow.  Not a star, willing to bet money on that.  I guess it could be a satellite, though most of the info I have read indicates that it will look like a very slow moving star.  This isn't the case, this thing hovers in one spot and spins in a circle.  Imagine someone pointing a flashlight at you, and spinning slowly with it.  You see the light bright, then slowly fade, then nothing, then slowly see it, then bright again.  And repeat.  45 degree angle from horizon, east of Destin, FL.
