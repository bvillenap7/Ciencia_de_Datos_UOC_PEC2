There were a number of red balls of light flying in a sort of formation over the Gulf of Mexico. They were flying low to the Gulf and made no sound. They flew at high speeds and made turns at right angles in such a way that any man made air craft would not be able to do. They appeared and disappeared. They flew back and forth within I'd say a 5 mile length of area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));30.3954416666667;-86.4708333333334
Multi-color fireball, Destin, FL.;2000-11-20 22:30:00;6 seconds;Multi-color fireball, Destin, FL. On Nov. 20, 2000 at 22:30 hours, my wife and I were walking west along the beach heading back to our hotel at Destin Florida. I stopped, turned around, and started looking southeast over the Gulf of Mexico. My wife turned around as well and looked in the same direction as I was looking. About 15 seconds later, we both saw a football shaped fireball that suddenly appeared about 10 degrees above the horizion heading straight downward. This firball was moving very slow, and we watched it for a good 6 seconds. Durning this time the fireball changed from a brilliant white color to a dual combination of burnt orange and green. The fireball was about dime size at arms length, and vanished an instant before making contact with the water. I estimate the range from us on the beach at no more than 3 miles. While walking the beach we noticed several meteors crossing the clear, nighttime sky, and this fireball resembled none of them. It was much, much bigger and brighter, and heading downward instead of crossing the sky.;30.3954416666667;-86.4708333333334
Fireball without sound  circled flight path times six out over the destin beach Summer night at a thousand feet.;2010-07-26 21:30:00;20 minutes;Fireball without sound  circled flight path times six out over the destin beach Summer night at a thousand feet. Fireball out over the Destin, FL, coastline with no noise and it circled from offshore to over our beach house at least six times at about a thousand feet in the night sky.  It flew over us without a trace of noise, and sped off zig zaging and stopping very abruptly.  When you freeze the dvd shot it looks like a disc, but eye sight it looke like a fireball, but moved so fast it was remarkable to see in person.  It actually looked like the back end of a fire ring, hugh fireball shaped, silent and repeated a circlular track for about 20 mins.  The funny thing is that the naval Air station for pensacola, FL is right up the beach?    We all saw it and had no explanation for what we all had seen that night.;30.3954416666667;-86.4708333333334

The lights will last as long as 30 minutes.    I live a couple blocks from the Gulf.  Each time they float from the SW to the S then slowly disappear.  Since we live next to one of the largest air force bases, we have always thought the they were flares or afterburners, until over the summer we sat outside with two pilots.  They said that they were neither and could not explain what they were.   Since then, I have been waiting for it to occur again.  I did over the summer but I was unable to capture on my iPhone (the video wouldn't lock).   I have never seen this occur other than during the summer.
