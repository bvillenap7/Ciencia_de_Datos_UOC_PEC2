Stationary object(s) over Destin, Florida.  ((anonymous report));2018-12-06 02:00:00;10 minutes;Stationary object(s) over Destin Florida I woke up unexpectedly about 1:45.  I went outside to smoke.  I saw the object, it looked like a crystal.  Mostly pink and blue.  It looked to have three lights, like a stoplight.  It was stationary and stayed just above the treeline.  My eye was drawn to another set of lights and then a third, but I think the third may have been someone's Christmas tree through the trees.  I felt fully awake and frightened.  I stared at it for a bit and then the sky began to lighten, like when the sun starts coming up.  I grew afraid and went back inside my apartment.
