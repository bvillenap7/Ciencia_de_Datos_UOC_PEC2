To many bright orbs.;2014-10-30 20:00:00;2 hours;To many bright orbs We had orb lights here above our house in Dover Fl. for over 2 hrs this past Thursday night. They would circle the home then pull in together and spread out again around the whole house. This went on from about 8:15 until 10:10. pm. My father and I thought we should see if they would stay focused on the house or if they would follow us down our long drive. To our awe they followed us down the drive and then back up to the home again. At first there were 4 orbs then 5..  They stayed at that number until we started praying and calling on the name of Jesus thats when the weirdest thing happen... They turned into 8 or 9 orbs all bright white...It's like they needed to call on more help.  We watched them for about another 10 minutes or so and then went into the house.  They had been over our house for so long we were getting really bored with them.  I think they knew we were over it cause the next time we looked out the door they were just gone... As fast as they cam! e they were just gone. We have had other sights of really strange things here were where at.  Our house is tucked into the woods and there is hardly no city lights of any kind so we see a lot of sightings here.  We have seen teardrop shooting lights also really bright lights that change in color but never anything like this past Thursday night.  We all couldn't believe our eyes and there was so many of them.  It's been 2 nights now and there hasn't been anymore lights so far.;27.9902000000001;-82.2112000000003
String of lights in Tampa Bay area..  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-30 21:00:00;5 minutes;String of lights in Tampa Bay area A line of 29 lights in formation moving from the northwest heading southeast.  They were white lights with no navigation lights.  The spacing was equal except the last light in the formation was a little closer than the spacing of the others.  The craft appeared to be 30-40000 ft moving at 800-1000 kts. the last craft accelerated at about twice the speed of the others and overtook them.  This report was relayed to me by my father immediately after it happened.  My father is a pilot and would not report this.  He was very affected by this sighting.  He didn't think they fit with any military craft he was familiar with.;27.9902000000001;-82.2112000000003
