Unexplained Light In the Sky.;2012-03-16 21:03:00;3 min;Unexplained Light In the Sky. I was intending to take pictures of the planet alignment.  When i started taking pictures they came out very strange. (I have the pictures)   A couple of hours later around 12 am or so i went back outside and noticed a large light in the sky.  I then grabbed my camera and went to take the picture,  When i did the light began to move around in the sky.  The light never showed up on the pictures.  And eventually it just trailed off into the distance and disappeared.;30.8719;-85.9162
