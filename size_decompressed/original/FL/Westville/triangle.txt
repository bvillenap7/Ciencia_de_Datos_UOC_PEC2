I saw a triangular shaped object moving unbelievably fast to the south east, each of the three sides appeared to curve slightly towards the center and possibly towards the rear. It had four greenish-blue, dim lights on the bottom one in the middle towards the rear and one at each corner, and it had a greenish-blue glow around its outline. It was completely silent as it streaked across the sky. I donâ€™t know what its altitude was, but it appeared to be roughly about the same size as a fighter jet at 5000 ft.;30.8719;-85.9162
