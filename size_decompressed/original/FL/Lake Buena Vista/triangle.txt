Unknown object in sky emitting or reflecting lights in area of EPCOT, Florida.;2003-12-16 19:17:00;?;Unknown object in sky emitting or reflecting lights in area of EPCOT, Florida. Not noticed at scene.  Only noticed upon viewing of photo on computer.  Photo was taken on a Sony DSC-P92 digital camera.  I did make the flash go off to get the shot of Spaceship Earth, as I did not want the apeture to stay open too long, so it is a fairly quick exposure.;28.3936;-81.5391
