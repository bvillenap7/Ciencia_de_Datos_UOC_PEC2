I first noticed an elongated orange light in the eastern sky, approx. 15 degrees above the horizon. It was about the length of a fingernail at arm's length, and angled at about 45 degrees upward. This initial light seemed to 'grow' a tail which streamed downward along a 45 degree angle with a bright golden glow, stretching to approx. one finger length (at arm's length). The cone of the light itself did not move. The cone or head seemed to have points like a 5-pt star which extended slightly beyond the circular light center. After about 20-25 seconds, the 'tail' shrunk back until only the original light was visible. Then, from the center, two lights emerged and created a triangular pattern, half a finger-length across at its widest span. These 3 lights were differently colored: red, blue,gold. Two lights moved away from the center one, creating a larger triangular shape. First the red, then the blue light gradually faded out. Then the gold bottom light slowly moved toward the horizon where I lost sight of it.;28.3936;-81.5391
