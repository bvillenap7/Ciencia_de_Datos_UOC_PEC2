The lights caught my attention and were unusually low and about 90 to 100 ft  directly above the right breakdown lane.  I was traveling 75 mph and as I approached it I looked straight up from my windshield and could see the clear out line silhouette of a triangular blackish object with 3 very red lights on the bottom one on each corner but more in the center not the tip.  It was still night time but the back drop from sky I saw clearly the object..I would say it was over 2 car lengths wide aprox. 35 to 40 feet wide.  I slowed down to 55mph and was like, What was that! it was between Mile marker 55 and 53.  Eastbound lane .;25.8734;-81.1599
