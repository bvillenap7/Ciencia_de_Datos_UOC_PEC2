Strobing white lighted object moving fast with no sound at an estimated 100 feet.;2021-01-18 20:05:00;5 seconds;Strobing white lighted object moving fast with no sound at an estimated 100 feet. On our nightly walk at 20:05 EST in Saint Johns, Florida (32259), we saw a very fast moving, white light strobing flying object, there were no other colors witnessed. There was no sound and it was traveling at approximately 100 feet from the ground, east toward the Atlantic ocean.  We live in the area of Naval Air Station Jacksonville, and can tell the difference between planes and helicopters. This object was moving too fast to be a helicopter, and made no sound at all. It also did not have any other lights to indicate a plane flying at night.  The other 2 witnesses have 40+ years of experience as Naval Aircrewman on the P-3 Orion.;30.0822;-81.5497999999998
