Walking my dog last night and noticed a object rise above the tree line about 1 to 2 miles from where I was standing.  The object had 4 bright red lights in a diamond shape with a bright green light in the middle.  No lights were blinking, just solid.  The object then stop in the middle of the sky and did a 90 degree turn towards me for about an 1/8 of a mile and stopped.  It stayed there for about 4 minutes then went back down behind the tree line again.  That was the last that I seen it.
