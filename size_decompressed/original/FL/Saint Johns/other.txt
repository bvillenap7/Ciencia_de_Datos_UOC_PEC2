I was walking my dog when all of a sudden this thing flew by it was about the size of a car and it was v shaped.   It had 2 yellow lights on the front and 2 yellow lights on the back with a red light in the middle  it was making a low siren sound and I believed at first that it was an aircraft in distress.   It made a circle over head and then hovered before landing a bit away in the woods.   I live near a naval base, so that could be an explanation but its behavior was strange for a naval craft, especially being near a residential area and the hovering.;30.0822;-81.5497999999998
