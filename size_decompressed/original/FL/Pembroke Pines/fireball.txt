((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch at 2055 hrs (EDT).  PD))  We saw something in the north sky at around 20:40 that was not normal.;2005-04-29 20:55:00;3 minutes;We saw something in the north sky at around 20:40 that was not normal. My wife and I were sitting in the backyard when I saw a steaking light that left a trail of smoke. We first thought it was a firework or a flare but then it kept going higher in the sky and then it seemed to explode. At first it looked like a firework but then it looked like when you watch a space move when a planet explodes it looked just like something out of a star wars movie. It was not normal....... ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the witness describes above the launch of a Titan IV missile out of Cape Canaveral, which occurred at 20:55 hrs. (Eastern) on this date.  The missile apparently was launched to the northeast, so it was visible along the eastern shoreline of the U. S..  PD));26.0153444444444;-80.3259527777778
Shocking, caught me off guard!;2016-03-26 20:15:00;1.5-2.0 minutes;Shocking, caught me off guard! Fireball came from the South just west of US 27 over the Everglades moving N/NW slowly.  Looked like a large balloon on fire from a distance, and then kept traveling instead of coming down.  I recorded it on my cell phone, but only a moving white dot appeared on the camera.;26.0153444444444;-80.3259527777778
