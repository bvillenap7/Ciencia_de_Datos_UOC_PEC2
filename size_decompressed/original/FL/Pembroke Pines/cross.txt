Cross-shape with what appeared to look like neon lights starting in the center and radiating outward.  ((Celestial body??));2004-08-16 06:04:00;43 minutes;Cross-shape with what appeared to look like neon lights starting in the center and radiating outward. I looked out from my patio (which is a Southeastern exposure on the Southeast coast of Florida) and noticed what I thought was a bright twinkling star. This sighting was East (which I believe would put this over the Atlantic ocean) not very high in the sky. I looked through an ordinary pair of binoculars and was shocked to see what was cross-shape with may changing neon-like colors. They all seemed to glow from the center of this cross and radiate outward to all four points. I could see red to pink, blues, greens and yellow hues. Very vivid! I tried this with a total of three pair of binoculars and they all revealed the same thing. I can't say this was a craft of any kind, I have no idea what I was looking at. I didn't know if I was looking at stars - the others looked nothing like this. I was simply amazed! It was fixed for the 43 minutes I observed it until it became too light and I lost sight of it. I realized the last time I saw it that it was slighty higher than when I first took notice of it. I told a friend the next day who thought I was perhaps seeing Venus. I looked out the following morning around 4AM and looked around with my binoculars. I did see the same thing and called my friend who lives a bit Northeast from me. She did see what I described but said she thinks it is Venus. That would have been fine, but now on this second evening I saw two of these objects on the east, quite a distance apart from one another, and I saw a third one looking southwest from my patio. They were all this cross-shape and had these colors and they were ALL fixed. I don't know what to make of it! ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness was looking at a star or planet.
