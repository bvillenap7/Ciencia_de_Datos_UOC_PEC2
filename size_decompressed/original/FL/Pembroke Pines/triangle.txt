The location was within a mile of the Perry airport where the Met life, Goodyear and tommy Hilfiger blimps were moored. This craft made no sound and was clearly close enough to hear even a blimp motor. It was a large triangle, with mostly rounded edges and what appeared to be rounded cruise ship bank of curved windows across the back. It was black matt finish with an inflated metal look. There were 3  round 'pads' in the corners but eminated no light. It was at the altitude that the single engine banner planes would pass over to drop signs at the airport and it was slowly drifting due south toward hard rock stadium following university dr it passed directly over the publix and spanned across the store, parking lot, canal between my home and publix and part of my yard. It is exactly what I am watching on the show Unidentified.;26.0153444444444;-80.3259527777778

triangular object with flashing red, blue and white lights.;2006-01-08 21:00:00;40 minutes;triangular object with flashing red, blue and white lights. I  was taking out the garbage last night when I happened to notice a triangular object with blue, red, and white blinking lights in the southwest sky. I called my two young daughters out to see it and we watched it for approximately 10 minutes. I went into the house to grab a pair of binoculars and returned to discover that it was joined by another similar object. The two objects were visible for an additional 30 minutes. They remained in the same general area over the everglades and were not moving the entire time. Then they just dissapeared.
