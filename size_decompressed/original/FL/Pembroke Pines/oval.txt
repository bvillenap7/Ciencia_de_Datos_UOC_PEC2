PEMBROKE PINES FLORIDA. DISC SHAPED ORANGE CRAFT. SILENT AN SLOW MOVING;1992-07-03 19:00:00;3 MINUTES;PEMBROKE PINES FLORIDA. DISC SHAPED ORANGE CRAFT. SILENT AN SLOW MOVING UFO Sighting Friday July 3rd 1992     On Friday evening, July 3rd 1992 I invited a number of guests to enjoy a Pool-Party with neighbors of mine. We lived in Pembroke Pines Florida near Ft Lauderdale.   At around dusk, which was probably around 7:00 pm, I heard my neighbors who were in my back yard yelling for me to come outside as a UFO was passing directly over my yard. As I came out, I was stunned to see the brightest orange object I have ever seen in my life. The craft was flying several thousand feet in the air. The size of the object was about 50 to 75 feet across. The object was disc-shaped. The color orange was so bright you could not make out any details of the bottom of the craft.  The craft made absolutely no noise and was cruising rather slowly in a north-to south direction. Upon realizing this, I quickly called my brother who lived due south of me in Miami to run outside with his video camera to capture this incredible sight. Unfortunately, when I called, my brother was not home. The local Miami FOX news channel however, did receive video footage of this event and broadcasted it the next day. If you want any further information of this sighting please call me at 206-((number deleted))   Not that this should matter, but I am a certified helicopter pilot with excellent vision and acuity. I would consider myself to be a better than average witness. Regards, ((name and telephone number deleted));26.0153444444444;-80.3259527777778
