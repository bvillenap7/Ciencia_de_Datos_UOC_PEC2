spherical egg shaped bright green-stationary then lightning fast...twice!;1993-08-12 02:00:00;10 MINUTES;spherical egg shaped bright green-stationary then lightning fast...twice! My sighting coincides with entry for 8-12-93,ft.lauderdale, sighting. I too witnessed the same,I just didnt know where to report this until now!  I had a witness at the time of the sighting, and it was august of 93 just a few miles S. of Ft.Laud. It was spherical-egg shaped, bright green, and hovered a few hundred feet directly above us and remained stationary for 2 min. During the 2 min.we moved our heads from side to side to be sure our eyes werent playing tricks on us,and it seemed to move in an opposite direction each time I leaned forward or back .Then, after our utter disbelief about what we were seeing, it shot out lightning fast to the west horizon, then hovered there for another 2 min. Then it did a zig zag left and right, and then shot back directly over us again!  I started to cry and had chills on the back of my neck with my hands covering my mouth in total shock. It hovered stationary again in the exact spot it was before,then shot out again to the west horizon,moved up then down this time, then disappeared.;26.0153444444444;-80.3259527777778
Black sphere traveling steadily at low altitude;2002-07-04 17:30:00;1 minute;Black sphere traveling steadily at low altitude I was alone in my back yard and heard an aircraft.  I live right by North Perry Airport, so there are lots of small planes.  I looked up and saw a jet climbing and behind/below it a black ball.  They were both traveling northwest but the ball was much lower.  I would guess it was roughly  the size of a very small airplane compressed and traveling steadily at about the same speed as a small plane.  I was stunned and thought it had something to do with being the 4th of July and at first thought it looked like it was following the airplane.  We were also to be on high alert for terrorism this day.  I watched it for about a minute with nobody else to yell to come see.  I thought about calling 911 but thought they'd think i was nuts.  I can't stop thinking about it so have been online and decided to post it.  Maybe someone else saw it - had to have but maybe they'll read this.;26.0153444444444;-80.3259527777778
