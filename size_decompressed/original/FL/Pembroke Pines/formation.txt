Formation or fleet of UFOs, orange/red oval shape.;2011-07-04 21:30:00;5 minutes;formation or fleet of UFOs, orange/red oval shape. On July 4th 2011, at approximately 21:30pm, there were firewalls towards the east of my home (Pembroke Pines).  My neighbors were also doing some firewalls, and I went out my home to  watch them while walking my dog.  Then I saw a formation of six (6) bright incandescent red/orange oval objects in the sky, to the east, traveling from north to south.  The distance between each object was exactly the same, and there was not a noise from them.  The traveling speed was constant.  So, initially I thought a kind of balloons, perhaps attached between them, however I disregarded that explanation because of the constant speed, no noise, and the size of each object (bigger than a commercial airplane).  I see frequently lot of planes due to the location of the two airports (MIA and FLL), and these objects were not airplanes.  My neighbors saw them also, and they described them as something “bizarre”.  I follow the object with my eyes all the way, until the horizon did not allo! w me to watch them anymore.  However, after the six-object passed all the way in front of my sight, one minute after, another object, same shape and color started flying in the same spot the six other started minutes before, and this one follow the same path of the others, at a much more speed than the previous ones.   I am an engineer working in technology for many years.  This was the first time I saw what I do believe are UFOs.;26.0153444444444;-80.3259527777778
