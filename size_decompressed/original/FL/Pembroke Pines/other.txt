It lasts about a minute with the longest sustained for around 2 minutes.  Very unsettling as i cant see anything overhead that would cause it and the sound doesnt seem to move at all when it comes. Other neighbors dogs who were being walked outside all went nuts barking and panicking just now while i was outside.;26.0153444444444;-80.3259527777778
