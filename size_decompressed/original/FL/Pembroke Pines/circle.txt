Floating above the clouds, it went up and down the clouds for about 2 minutes.  Then it swirved westardly into the Everglades, quickly and silently.;26.0153444444444;-80.3259527777778
5 star-like objects gliding/flying from Jupiter/Saturn area through the sky. 2  of the same objects coming back directly to Jupiter.;2020-08-16 21:00:00;45 minutes;5 star-like objects gliding/flying from Jupiter/Saturn area through the sky. 2  of the same objects coming back directly to Jupiter. I can’t even express the shock I’m in!!!  Tonight, as I sat on the bench outside while my husband was night fishing, I stared up into the beautiful night sky watching the airplanes fly back and forth and dazing into the stars.  I watch them almost every night, I basically know the planes patterns .  I’ve always admired the sky and wished I could know more!  Let me just say I KNOW WHAT I SAW!!  I saw what looked to be a flying/gliding star/object!  It flew northbound, right into this fast-moving cloud. NOW it could have been the clouds that made it look like the star was moving OR it could have been a satellite or space station. NO! I quickly pulled out my phone and opened my star map (which shows space stations and satellites).  It wasn't in our atmosphere!  Before I knew it, it was gone. My husband didn't see it.  I kept looking and saw another coming from the same direction but going downward then away from us, he didn't see that either!  Within 10 minutes I saw 3 more Unidentified flying objects all coming from the Jupiter/Saturn area headed northbound! FINALLY, my husband saw the last one!! I'M NOT CRAZY!  There is no way it was an airplane it did not have lights and was way too far out!  It was not a shooting star either, there was no trail and it made it to the other side of the sky until it was too far to see and all from the SAME direction? I don't think so!!  I could not believe it!!  I searched for 10 more minutes and didn't see anymore!  So, as I was going to go inside, I looked once more! I see ANOTHER UFO, but this time coming from where they disappeared, traveling straight towards Jupiter!!!  We followed it until Jupiter’s massive light engulfed it.  HOW CRAZY!!!!  There was no way I was going inside after that!! There had to be at least 4 more coming back!!  So, another 5 minutes go by and Mauricio was beginning to walk inside, and I screamed because I saw It!!!  He caught sight if it and I ran to avoid losing it behind the palm tree and as I did so, it completely disappeared in its track DIRECTLY TOWARDS JUPITER!!!!!  No way, no how that that was a coincidence!!! Something is going on and/or something is about to happen! I'm still in awe!!;26.0153444444444;-80.3259527777778
