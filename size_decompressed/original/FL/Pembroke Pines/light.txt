Just before returning into the house I looked straight up overhead and saw what looked like a red smear of light, moving South.  I pointed it out to my wife who stood and watched it with me.  At first we thought it might be a shooting star, or after we noticed that the light remained constant, we thought it was a piece of space junk, but we thought it was too large for that.  Also, it appeared to us that it was wavering a bit on it's path, not going in exactly a straight line.  As it approached the Southern horizon, it made a sharp right turn, heading West, for approximately 10 seconds, then stopped and sort of looped back to the East disappearing.  I mentioned this event the next morning on my local radio show, and received a phone call from someone claiming to be an Air Traffic Controller at Fort Lauderdale International Airport, who said they had picked it up on their radar, could not explain it, and had turned the tapes over to the authorities  When I asked him who he meant by authorities he said the FAA.;26.0153444444444;-80.3259527777778

LOOKING UP AT THE SOUTHEAST SKY , I NOTICED WHAT LOOKED LIKE A STAR. IT WAS VERY DIM AND NOT UNUSUAL LOOKING. AS I STARED AT IT, IT BECAME MORE AND MORE INTENSE. I FIGURED IT WAS A SHOOTING STAR, WHICH I HAVE SEEN MANY TIMES BEFORE. THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS ONE WAS THAT THERE WAS NO TRAIL. AS I KEPT LOOKING AT IT, IT BECAME MUCH BRIGHTER AND LOOKED TO BE COMING TOWARD ME. ALL OF A SUDDEN IT TURNED RIGHT AND BECAME DIMMER. I THOUGHT AGAIN THAT IT WAS A SHOOTING STAR BUT CONTINUED TO FOLLOW IT. IT CONTINUED TO GO RIGHT OR SOUTH THEN BECAME A BIT BRIGHTER THEN DIMMER VARIOUS TIMES UNTIL IT SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR. I AM REPORTING THIS BECAUSE I AM CURIOUS TO KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE SAW WHAT I SAW. I AM 46 YEARS OLD AND HAVE NEVER REPORTED OR SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.;26.0153444444444;-80.3259527777778
2 lights, possibly the front and back of one object, move in the night sky and vanish as if dimming to naught, in 8 seconds;2008-03-08 20:30:00;8 seconds;2 lights, possibly the front and back of one object, move in the night sky and vanish as if dimming to naught, in 8 seconds I was lying on a blanket, outside, star gazing with the naked eye.  I was just staring at Orion, when off to the left, East, I noted a star with 2 very bright companions.  At first I did a double take - there had been no pair of bright stars there all night, as I had been out since 6:30pm and it was now after 8pm EST.  The lights were separated consistently by the same distance, to an observer, it would be about 200 or 300 ft in length, if it were one object, with a light in the 'front' and one in the 'back'.  These two lights were separated like stairs, one slightly above the other, but they moved very very slowly, and in tandem, making me think it was one object but its edges were not quite visible to complete its form.  The issue for me, that made me sit up and really stare hard, was the fact that at first, I thought it was a constellation.  I wasn't even sure it was moving, or they were moving.  Then the distance between the two lights moving together away from a near by star made it apparent.  But the distance between the lights did not alter, nor the -----   ___  stair like separation.  There was no sound, but it was not that close, I would say 10,000 ft up and quite a way off.  There was no blinking or other colors other than white, with a very faint hint of blue on the outside of the white lights.  They moved slowly, much too slowly for a plane, and the lights were about double the size of the nearby star, but brighter by a degree or so than any of the stars in the sky or in nearby Orion.  It moved very slowly from North To South for approximately 8 seconds and then seemed to dematerialize, or slowly dim and shut off.  It did NOT travel far enough to dim due to distance.  Not at all.  And for the last two weeks there has been persistent small aircraft, general aviation Cessna, circling and circling West Lake and points right around my house, like never before, and I am a flight sim buff and can recognize most aircraft.  I don't know if that has any connection to the lights, but o! ne thing did change.  The aircraft for the last two weeks circled DIRECTLY over my lake, in about a 5 sq. mile circle, approximately 5,000 ft of altitude, unusual for my area, because most general aviation aircraft, A.) are lower, ready to land, or having just taken off from North Perry Airport, 2.5 miles to the southeast of the lake, and B.) traffic slows to the airport after sunset, and after 9pm, I believe only has its facility operating with the tower unmanned.  It is unusual to see a Cessna type aircraft circling for so many hours, sometimes up to 4 hours, and ONLY after sunset.  I thought perhaps it was nighttime IFR training for student Pilots, but I am not sure, because tonight, that plane was about 2 miles further west, and cirlcing.  It circles clockwise for about an hour or so, and then reverses for a couple hours.  Tonight, right after the lights I saw, the craft switched its circular pattern, from Clockwise to Counter-Clockwise, AND it shifted directly over my house, and where I was laying, on a blanket, out in the yard, much closer to where the lights I had seen, had appeared.  The plane directly shifted, right after the lights.  And it stayed in this pattern for another hour or so.  It also shifted in the middle of that time, to the opposite heading, clockwise again.  I have no idea what to think of the plane, other than the lessons theory.  Unless it is an observer flight, or something?  I do not know what I saw, but it had no lights like a plane (no wings, nose, rudder shape), and was so slow, no plane could have stayed up in the sky, it would have stalled.  Furthermore there were no flashing lights and no colored lights.  The light was about twice the size of the star near it, but several times more bright.  And it was silent and moved in tandem, or was one body, with 2 lights.  And it evaporated, dimmed rapidly and was no more.;26.0153444444444;-80.3259527777778

Craft shoots across evening sky on edge of the Everglades;2009-12-27 18:11:00;1 minute;Craft shoots across evening sky on edge of the Everglades On December 27, 2009, I was outside of my home at about 18:00. I was taking pictures across the lake, I live on the outskirts of the Everglades. When I downloaded my pictures from my camera to my computer, I had an object that appeared in two pictures. One taken at 18:11 and the other taken at 18:12. Please notice the distance the craft traveled in one second.  I have seen many strange lights in the sky living so close to the glades. But this is the first time I've captured it on my camera. The Camera I used was a digital Cannon G-9.  I have mailed the images in a separate email. Please check the name so you can compare this report with the one I mailed to your email;26.0153444444444;-80.3259527777778

The light was traveling at a high speed, faster than a commercial airplane.  After entering in some clouds, it disappeared. I do not know if is a satellite, or a UFO, but I think is not an airplane because it was traveling at a very high altitude, and moving at a faster speed than I have seen on airplanes, and it was a single white and bright constant light, with out more lights, and no noise at all.;26.0153444444444;-80.3259527777778
Dot turns into huge light, and then back to dot.  Seen by 2 people.;2017-07-04 17:00:00;15 seconds;Dot turns into huge light, and then back to dot.  Seen by 2 people. Looking up in the sky with brother in law..  I said, Wow, look out at the stars.  One of those dots is moving,  It must be a satellite.  Moving in a constant straight line. We both were looking at it, when it suddenly either grew to the size of a silver dollar or shot out a perfect white circular light the size of a silver dollar.  And then in a split second went back down to the size of the tiny star size dot.  A silver dollar size object in the sky that is a perfect circle and white light looks very weird and should not be there ..  The huge circle was in view by both of us and lasted less then a full second.  We both said.. DID YOU SEE THAT? !!!!  It was very weird, so I tried to look up all kind of stuff on the internet but nothing sounded similar..  so I found this report and thought I should at least write about the event..  I can still see it in my mind..  I wish I could have that on video..  I am so happy someone else saw it with me..not sure what it was..  But I have never seen anything do that  before.;26.0153444444444;-80.3259527777778

Three bright red lights moving east to west near FLL.  ((anonymous report));2019-02-06 21:00:00;15 minutes;Three bright red lights moving east to west near FLL I live in an area where you can see the planes going towards Fort Lauderdale Airport.  Also in the vecinity there is a small airport for advertisement airplanes and helicopters.  I also used to work as a night security guard outdoors.  What I saw was not planes or helicopters. I was walking out of a food store when I saw a bright, steady red light moving east to west which at first appeared to be an airplane.  I noticed immediately it was not blinking but did not have the characteristics of a helicopter in flight at night. I tried to photograph and video it with my cellphone.  Just as I was putting away the phone, I saw an identical object move in the same direction just a short distance behind the previous one.  For about 7 seconds I could see both bright red lights moving at the same speed.  I tried to take pictures and video. I drove towards a neighboring area away from the bright street lights.  I had the impression that the air traffic was off, as planes appeared to be circling the airport.  I could count 4 or 5 airplanes, clearly seen as blinking lights.  Even airplanes that were moving away appeared like distant blinking dots.  A small airplane landing at the little airport nearby appeared as one red light not too bright with a blinking red light.  It was landing west to east and it was easy to identify as a small airplane. At this point, I spotted the third, even brighter red light in the same point and moving in the same direction as the other two.  This was about 21:10 hours.  I walked away from my car to photograph and video it as it was even more clear than the other two and again did  not resemble a plane.  No sound could be heard at all.  Even the regular planes I could hear when they are visible that way, much more helicopters. After I lost sight of the third light, I waited about 15 more minutes but could not see anything besides planes.  On video the planes also appear as blinking lights, small and white or white and red.
