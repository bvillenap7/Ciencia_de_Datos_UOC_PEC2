Night sky orb craft seen over Florida River;2008-09-10 23:45:00;2-5 seconds;Night sky orb craft seen over Florida River It looked like an orb of light moving VERY QICKLY over the night sky over the St. Johns River. Originally we thought there was one light, then when it got close to he middle of it's track (nearly directly over the bridge) it became two distinct orbs. It may have been two crafts, but we (me and my boyfriend) think it was just one. It moved from South to North (I think, it may be the opposite), then hovered. We lost sight of it for maybe a second, then when the area it hovered in was back in our line of sight, it had disappeared.;29.6613;-81.5897
