I looked out the window and saw this very bright light in the eastern sky.  I got my camera out and put it on a tripod ... I got some amazing footage of this. White-blue and red lights inside the cirlce... a black spot that moved around inside the white circle.;26.9366063291139;-80.1253594936709
Orange round lights.;2013-01-01 00:10:00;10 minutes;orange round lights My wife and I had just left a friends house and had dropped by to pick up a pizza.  On our way home I saw two lights coming from east to west.  At first I thought it was fire works.  However, after watching them hover a few minutes they traveled off to the west and seemed to fizzle out. They were followed by 2 more.  We watched them do the same thing then two more appeared and repeated the process. We were still trying to figure this out.  Could it be flares, weather balloons, satelllites.... It was bizzare but we were trying to come up with a logical explanation.  We then circled around about a half mile directly acroos from where we had been and we saw two more objects again repeating the same tract.  As we watched from this direction we could see that the lights were not fizzling out as we thought but were going above the cloud cover.  We drove home and I filed this report asap. We were not drunk or high.;26.9366063291139;-80.1253594936709

Larger as it approached and passed my back yard and then moved upward.  It grew smaller and glowed more yellow until it was very high and looked like a star.  Seemed not to move at that point. It came in over from the ocean and then moved higher and faster as it went west and upward.;26.9366063291139;-80.1253594936709
