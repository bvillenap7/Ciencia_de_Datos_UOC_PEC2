My wife woke me after seeing this bright hovering light in the eastern sky over the ocean. We live right off the beach in Jupiter Florida. This object very well maybe a UFO it was moving and sort of dropping laterally from side to side for quite sometime. I am not sure if it was a planet ??  But it was extremely well lit and had us observing it for over 20 minutes this morning.. We don't know what it was exactly but it was a beautiful almost cross like diamond shape object.. What can i say .. we are not nuts that report weird things and never have .. we just are curious if anybody else may have seen this event this morning 8/14/01 Thanks, ((NUFORC Note:  We have received many reports in the recent past which are very similar to this one.  We believe that most of these reports are being caused by sightings of Venus, which we believe is seen in the eastern sky during the early morning.  However, that is only an educated guess.
