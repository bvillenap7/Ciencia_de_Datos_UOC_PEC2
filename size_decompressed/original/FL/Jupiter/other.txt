Flame object giving off colored rings in the sky then exploding.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible missile launch??  PD));1997-05-20 04:01:00;20 Min;Flame object giving off colored rings in the sky then exploding. It was about 4:00 AM in morning me and my wife stopped for coffee.  When we exited out of our vehicle my wife pointed out what looked to be a flaming comet to our east. it moved across the sky slowy from north to south. then we saw florecent colored rings emitting off of the object the first ring was pink then the next one was blue then green then orange.  the object then exploded. but these gas rings floated in the atmosphere for awhile. we call the local radio station to see if they had heard anything about it. they said the phones have been ringing off the hook with people calling in asking about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  Date of incident may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  We wonder whether the witnesses might have observed a rocket launch out of Cape Canaveral, but that is only a guess.  One of three reports from same witness.  PD));26.9366063291139;-80.1253594936709
