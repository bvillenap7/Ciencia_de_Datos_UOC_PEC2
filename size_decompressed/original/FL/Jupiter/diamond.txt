Ball of fire hovering over ocean near Jupiter.;2013-11-06 22:00:00;2-3 minutes;Ball of fire hovering over ocean near Jupiter In the North Eastern sky by the Juno Beach pier there was a bright light (looked as if it was a fire) surrounded by clouds.  It stayed in the night sky over the ocean for about two to three minutes with no flight path.   I pulled out my phone, snapped a picture when I looked up, it was gone.  My girlfriend and three other guys who were there saw this as well.  They said it just faded away. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Fiery red-orange diamond shaped object over Jupiter, Florida.;2013-12-07 21:40:00;1-2 minutes;Fiery red-orange diamond shaped object over Jupiter, Florida. At 9:40 pm on December 7th 2013 my wife myself and another couple had just finished dinner at a popular Jupiter Fl. restaurant.  We were standing outside the front door (facing north) discussing Christmas party plans when we noticed a bright fiery red-orange object (no flashing lights) to the northeast at a distance of 2-3miles. The object was traveling slowly east to west at approximatly 4000 to 6000 ft elevation and seemed to be just below light cloud cover.  When the object was directly in front of us (1/2 to 3/4 mile) was when we realized it was diamond shaped and completely silent. As it passed by heading west it either flashed a orange light upwards (1 sec.) or was reflecting off the clouds.  The object seemed to pick up speed and elevation while it looked to be heading into space.  The entire event lasted 1-2 minutes.;26.9366063291139;-80.1253594936709
