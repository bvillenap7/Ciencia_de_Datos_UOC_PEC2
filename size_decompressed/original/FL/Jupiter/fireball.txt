Slow moving, silent orange lights.;2014-04-22 20:00:00;10 minutes;Slow moving, silent orange lights. Approximately 8pm on 4/22/14, two orange lights in the sky were noted, approximately 2000 ft. above the Jupiter, FL, coastline, heading South.   At first they appeared to be aircraft inbound to PBI, but their movement was slow, no noise, with a pulsating orange color.   Four of us witnessed this event.   Finally, the two objects were joined by three similar pulsating orange lights which approached from the Southeast.   Upon joining, the five objects progressed slowly North, up the coastline, until they vanished from site.  Calls to the Jupiter Police and Channel 5 (WPTV) revealed that nobody else had phoned in this siting.;26.9366063291139;-80.1253594936709

Five fireballs traveling in the same direction at the same speed and somewhat equidistant from each other.;2015-01-01 01:00:00;15 minutes;Five fireballs travelling in the same direction at the same speed and somewhat equidistant from each other. I was traveling home after a New Years Eve Party.  I noticed while driving a red and orange pulsating fireball travelling in a North East direction.   I pulled off to the side of the road to have a better look.  There was no sound and the speed was rather slow yet consistent.  Just after this object passed out of site, another one appeared traveling in the same direction and speed.   I proceeded to my destination as I was dropping off a friend at her home.  While parked in her driveway, I again noticed a third fireball soon followed by two more of these objects.  I could see the final two spaced apart at the same time again travelling at the same speed.  The whole episode took 8 to 12 minutes.  I can offer nothing more here other than the three of us are in our 60's and were not intoxicated from the party.  Actually one of us had nothing to drink at all.;26.9366063291139;-80.1253594936709

I witnessed the first light and as I was watching it became brighter and then a second one appeared to the right.  Ran inside to get my husband, when I came back out the second orange ball of light was quickly fading and the first one slowly faded away as well.  It happened on new years eve, and there were fireworks, but these were not fireworks, they resembled more of a star.  Possibly a flare, but the was no trail of light or smoke or anything.;26.9366063291139;-80.1253594936709
