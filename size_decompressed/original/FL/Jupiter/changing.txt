Rising fireball, turned into rounded square with single rotating light around perimeter that started clockwise then reversed rotation.;2014-01-20 19:15:00;5-7 minutes;Rising fireball, turned into rounded square with single rotating light around perimeter that started clockwise then reversed rotation. Big fireball approx. 200-300 ft overhead, looked like hot air balloon rising slow but mostly fire.   Gradually changed to solid, rounded square shape w/single light rotating clockwise, then counter clockwise around perimeter of craft.   Rose slowly then accelerated quickly from SW to NE leaving faint heat like con trail.   Definitely not a balloon, model rocket or any aircraft I'm aware exists!  There was no sound.;26.9366063291139;-80.1253594936709
