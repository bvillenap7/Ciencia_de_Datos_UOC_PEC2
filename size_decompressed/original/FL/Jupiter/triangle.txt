We noticed a large completely black triangle blocking out the stars, moving VERY SLOW. Nothing but black. We watched it move - ever so slowly - for several minutes. It then, while we were staring at it, completely disappeared. Vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  In 2001, the Perseid Meteor Shower occurred on the night of August 12.  We have amended the date above.  PD));26.9366063291139;-80.1253594936709

It was a bright sunny, not a cloud in the sky, windy day in South Florida and I was doing my daily jog by the beach in the afternoon.   While heading back jogging south along the beach I looked up into the sky and noticed a strange silver object reflecting sunlight.  At first I figured it was a plane, but then the more I watched it the more intrigued I became and I had to stop and look closer.  It wasn't on the normal flight path that all the other planes come in at towards the PBI Airport and it was flying particularly slow.  The craft was also much higher in altitude than any of the planes and was heading directly west, then it suddenly vanished.  Afterwards I kept walking and a minute later I looked back in that direction only to see the craft again almost in the same location but now was heading directly south and picking up speed then vanished again. I then started walking at slow pace while still staring where the craft disappeared and between a minute or two minutes later it appeared again suddenly, a little further south of where I originally saw it the first two times and was moving very slowly west again and then quickly vanished once more.  Each time I saw the object it remained within sight for approximately five to ten seconds before vanishing.  And was it was difficult trying to see the shape of it as the light was reflecting off of it so strongly and it was at such a high altitude in the sky, but from what I could see it would have been in a more triangular shape. Twenty minutes after the sighting I saw three other regular airline planes heading on the normal flight path to the PBI Airport within five to ten minutes of each other, this helped me solidify what I saw with the craft and helped me make a better comparison as to how high the craft was in comparison to the planes.  I noticed however after all the descending planes going to the PBI Airport there was a fourth plane flying at a much higher altitude (not as high as the craft was) that was not descending but was flying west, and I wondered if it was following the craft or not.;26.9366063291139;-80.1253594936709

There where light blue lights at the ends and it drifted swiftly through the sky with no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
