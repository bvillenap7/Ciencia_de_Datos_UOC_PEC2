TIME LOSS extremly fast light traveling north;1994-06-15 14:00:00;8 hours;TIME LOSS extremly fast light traveling north It was around 2:00 pm my cousin and I decided to take a trip to tampa to meet some friends for the weekend we where traveling on the beeline highway heading west toward okeechobee we where just west of jupiter when my cousin pointed out the drivers side window and asked me if I could see what he was pointing at  I couldn't see it untill it passed over the car heading north. It was moving fast faster then any plane I have ever seen. We where amazed but just continued on our trip we arrived in Tampa at 10pm which had to be wrong because it takes 4 hours at the most which meant it should have been 6pm. We did not stop anywhere but for gas once. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Single small white light;2005-10-13 04:30:00;10 seconds;Looked up and noticed the sky was exceptionally clear.  As I was admiring the view I observed a single small white light directly over head traveling north to south at what appeared to be an extremely high altitude and moving fast.  It had the same appearence of the stars but moving.  Observed for approx. 10 seconds before I lost it in the horizon.

A light that looked like a star but moved erractically left to right and in a circular pattern.;2006-05-28 21:30:00;one hour;A light that looked like a star but moved erractically left to right and in a circular pattern. We saw a light above the ocean. Initially, we thought it was a star, however it  was moving erraticallly.  It would be still for awhile then it would move to the left or right and make circle patterns.  Eratic movements best describes it but it never got closer.  Planes came and went and they looked totally different.  It appeared to sparkle but would change hue from white to red.;26.9366063291139;-80.1253594936709

It looked like a bright light high in the sky.  Then it stoped hovered breifly, then to our amazment more lights came off of it and circled it.  It being the larger brighter light.  The smaller lights circling the larger one then came back to it and became one light again.which grew dim then bright then shot across the sky like nothing any of us had seen.then it came to a complete stop again.  And the smaller lights then came out again and circled the bright light.  This shooting across and stopping happend atleast four times.  And every stop was followed with the circling lights.  My neighbor who also witnessed and who is a retired army vet who served for twenty five years, was baffled and speachless.   I should have reported the incident sooner.  But I remember it like yesterday .  Thank you for your time.;26.9366063291139;-80.1253594936709
Groups of glowing orange objects moving randomly from east to west over Jupiter Inlet area at approximately 10:00 pm Oct 11, 2013.;2013-10-11 22:00:00;15 minutes;Groups of glowing orange objects moving randomly from east to west over Jupiter Inlet area at approximately 10:00 pm Oct 11, 2013. Observed what appeared to be large orange fireflies drifting from the southeast to northwest.  Came in a couple of groups or clusters moving randomly across the sky.  Did not appear to be very high in the sky. Pretty bizarre... Never seen anything remotely like it.  I can't provide any more detail although anyone with binoculars could have seen pretty clearly--wondering if anyone else had seen.  With the boat traffic and proximity to the Jupiter Inlet and Juno pier I would think fisherman would have seen.  Sky was clear...;26.9366063291139;-80.1253594936709
2 orange/yellow round lights traveling slowly one after the other from east to west until disappearing into the clouds.;2013-10-19 22:30:00;5 minutes;2 orange/yellow round lights traveling slowly one after the other from east to west until disappearing into the clouds Sighting was of an orange/yellow round light,glowing but steady - not flashing. It was fairly large- maybe the size of a streetlight seen from a block away.   It was moving at what seemed like a low altitude, from east/southeast to west/northwest, very slowly ascending (getting smaller) until it either flashed out or disappeared into the clouds.  There was no sound.   The duration was several minutes- long enough to go inside and get binoculars and still watch it upon return.   When it disappreared, a second one appreared from the same direction on the same trajectory at the same height and speed.;26.9366063291139;-80.1253594936709

Then I saw it move again this time to the left a little farther than where I originally saw it.  The object was also flashing slowly when it started to move.;26.9366063291139;-80.1253594936709
