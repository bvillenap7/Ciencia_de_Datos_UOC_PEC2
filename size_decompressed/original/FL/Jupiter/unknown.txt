A set of blinking lights simply turned around- not in the way an Airplane or Helicopter makes a u-turn.;2013-11-30 20:00:00;5-8 minutes;A set of blinking lights simply turned around- not in the way an Airplane or Helicopter makes a u-turn. While traveling on I-95 S., passing through Jupiter, FL.  There were a pair of blinking lights in the black sky heading N.  It would've passed for an airplane except when it turned the opposite direction, the lights (both)just turned no U-turn...just turned around and there was no sound being emitted from craft/object.

Saw something traveling south to north, leaving a trail of fire/sparks in a straight line.;2017-04-25 23:00:00;2-3 minutes;Walking dog aproximately 11PM, looked up towards west and saw something traveling south to north leaving a trail of fire/sparks in a straight line, not getting higher, or lower.  There was no noise.  I had my phone and fumbled for a minute to try to find camera, and realized that the thing was moving so fast, and so I watched it continue north towards the Jupiter inlet, and at that time the fire/sparks ended.   The thing was above the tree line from my view, but not high in the sky. I could not see  a shape, and there was no noise.  There were no headlights or flashing lights, like a plane, or helicopter would have made and there was no noise.   I would venture a guess that it was about 1/2 mile to one mile west of my location;26.9366063291139;-80.1253594936709
