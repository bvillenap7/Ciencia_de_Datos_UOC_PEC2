I gazed up at the sky and noticed what I thought to be a star. I realized it was too bright and it was moving. It seemed to be coming toward me (going east).  I then stopped to observe it because of its strong single light and the fact it seemed it was moving rather fast.  I live along the coast of Florida and it’s not so unusual to see planes, both private and commercial as we are within around 20 miles from an international airport. I have also seen many helicopters, even at night assisting in police searches. I believed this was something I hadn’t seen before.  I listened carefully, as I can usually hear the aircraft, but could not hear anything.  The sky was very clear, I compared the object to a star and it was similar, but too big, too bright and distinctly moving eastward. Within 15 or 20 seconds, this bright moving light abruptly became an oval shaped white light with a dark center facing downward and it slowed down, practically hovering. At this time it had been at least a minute and I ran to the front door and called my wife to see it. She concurred it was nothing we had ever seen before and we should call the police.  Instead I knocked on a neighbor’s door and asked him to come quickly.  He happens to be an avid fan of flying and sometimes attends the air force demonstrations. He as well concurred and together the three of us watched this object move laterally, slower than I had first observed. Now it was traveling south.  For about 30 seconds more it continued, the turned sharply west, moving away from us and just as the oval light had seemingly been switched on, it switched off.  Then it started moving at the original speed I had observed and we lost sight of it into the horizon, as if it went very far west.;26.9366063291139;-80.1253594936709
We saw a questionable object in the sky?;2010-10-31 19:30:00;3 mins;We saw a questionable object in the sky? On October 31, 2010 at approx. 7:30pm my husband and I and a neighbor saw a bright object in the sky.  It was facing west, it had an oval shape and appeared to be hollow in the middle and donut shaped. It was illuminated.  It clearly was not a plane or a helicopter, and not a shooting star.  It hovered back and forth and then traveled south at a slow speed, then continued to make a sharp turn west and then the lights went out.  It also had rays of light beamning down from the left and right side.;26.9366063291139;-80.1253594936709
