Daytona Beach UFO Triangle shaped  red/orange SW-NE.;2014-07-30 23:15:00;4 minutes;Daytona Beach UFO Triangle shaped  red/orange SW-NE. Object had three red/orange lights making the object appear to be a triangle shaped  moving steadily from southwest to north east outwards to the ocean.   At one point the first ufo either turned off “lights” or disappeared from sight and then re-appeared a second or two later on the same heading.  We lost sight of it as it went behind trees.   The second ufo appeared from no where with about the same heading but not in the exact path as the first one.   We heard no sounds, but from the altitude they were at, we should have heard something as there were actual small aircraft that we could hear in an area farther and in a different direction than the ones being reported.

Lasted 3 seconds Woke up exactly at 2:40, I woke my boyfriend up so we could get some water.  At 2:44, we both heard a low and fast flying piece of machinery fly east to west.  It started and was gone in 2-3 seconds.  We we're both shocked at the noise.  We saw no lights from the road.  Just darkness.   Do UFOs make noise?  We've never heard anything like it.   Wi-Fi in house has been down since event.  Animals were alert as well.;29.1384229219142;-81.0277987405558
