Orange ball in the sky with flashing strobe lights.;2015-03-12 22:45:00;2 minutes;Orange ball in the sky with flashing strobe lights. Looked up at the sky and saw a round orange ball traveling toward me just to the immediate south of my house, and to the immediate west of the Halifax River.   As the object got closer to me, 4 strobe lights appeared to flash approximately every 3 seconds.   As I exited the screen room, an orange tail appeared behind the object and it turned due east toward the river and ascended quickly into the sky until it disappeared.;29.1384229219142;-81.0277987405558
