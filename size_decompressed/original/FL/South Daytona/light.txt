The lights appeared at about 90 degrees above the horizon as I was riding along in the car with my Mother we both saw the object simultaneously they did not seem to move much if at all more of a hover all 8-9 objects were twice the size of stars and the lights all went out at the same time after about 45 seconds to 1 minute.
