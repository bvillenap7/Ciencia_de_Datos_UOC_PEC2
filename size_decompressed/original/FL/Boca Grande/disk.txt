Football field size saucer with blinking white lights, made no sound as it traveled across the sky near Boca Grande, FL;1998-12-18 22:00:00;5 minutes;Football field size saucer with blinking white lights, made no sound as it traveled across the sky near Boca Grande, FL My fiance and I were driving on the main road out to Boca Grande, FL at about 10:00 pm. We were the only car on the road at the time. We both noticed a weird object in the sky in front of us, it was huge, kind of like a big craft (saucer type shape). There were white blinking lights, they were unevenly spaced on the craft. We both exclaimed, Pull over, which we did. We got out and looked up at the saucer, but it was not making any sound at all. It must have been the size of a football field, but not a sound. It moved rather slowly over the trees and disappeared from our view. It was hard to tell exactly what shape it was or exactly how large it was, but it was definitely nothing we could explain. There are no airports or military areas anywhere near Boca Grande. We knew we had seen a UFO. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));26.7585;-82.2608
