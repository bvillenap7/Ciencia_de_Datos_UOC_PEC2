The most weirdest thing I have ever saw with my own eyes in my life!;2009-02-20 12:00:00;1-2 min;The most weirdest thing I have ever saw with my own eyes in my life! Hello.  My name is ((name deleted)) and I really am not sure if I am doing this correctly, but I would like to share a sighting that my husband and I saw today. I am a resident of High Springs, Florida.   While I was driving this afternoon around noon, my husband and I were driving down 441 (thats the name of the road) we were heading to Gainesville to run errands and in the corner of my eye I saw this shiny object in the sky.  I asked my husband what that was and he was like I'm not sure, it may be an airplane, I said no Edward if a plane was down that low it would be bigger than that and it wouldn't be that shiny.  It wasn't a bird nor a place.  This object was like a frisby and it was shiny, may have been silver or white in color, it was at a stand still for about a min or so.  I had to pull over to see if I could get a better look at it, and by the time I pulled over it was gone.  There was no resiadue, smoke or any sort of trial behind it.  I believe what my husband and I saw was indeed a UFO of some sort. I am not one of those people that just go looking for these sort of things, but I know what I saw and it was nothing normal about it.  It was the strangest thing I've ever saw in my life!  I'm geting goosebumps and teary eyed just writing this to you.  Also, the sky was crystal clear, no clouds or anything.  Broad daylight and it was just plain as day!  Amazing! WOW! If you need to contact me you may do so.  Here is my information:  ((personal information deleted));29.8378;-82.6129000000001
