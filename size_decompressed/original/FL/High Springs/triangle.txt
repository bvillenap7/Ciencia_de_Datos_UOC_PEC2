About 12 pm me and a friend were outside talking when a craft about 50 to 70 yards long and 30 yards wide at the widest point, hovard over us about 200ft off of the ground. It had only one light on the very front of it the light was shaped like a circle and was very bright but produced no light on the ground. It moved right over us at about 70mph then circled and came back by before shooting off at a incredable rate of speed.;29.8378;-82.6129000000001
