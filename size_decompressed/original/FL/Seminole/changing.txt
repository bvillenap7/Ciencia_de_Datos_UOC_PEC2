Pear shape fiery orb with black entities ascending and descending from nearby building.;2013-12-17 20:30:00;9+ minutes;Pear shape fiery orb with black entities ascending and descending from nearby building. On 12/17/13 I was on my way home from work approximately 8:40 p.m. Across from the veterans Hospital in Bay Pines Florida I witnessed a large Pear shaped fireball.  Its altitude was approximately 1,000ft high and due west.  I pulled over to the gas station mounted my phone in a still mount and began capturing video in HD.  During which time I noticed other smaller objects coming up and joining or twirling around said fireball.  To the naked eye you could see only a asprin sized amber colored ball and tiny spots of light coming from the ground to the object.  After reviewing frame by frame I noticed a common feature I have seen in other videos other residents and I have captured.  The Object is actually a circle of  smoke or a shock wave when zoomed in on with a Galaxy Note 3 HD video camera.  I have seen black shadow figures on the beach twice and orbs coming out of the gulf nightly since October 27th.  I mention this only because while reviewing frame by frame I c! aptured several black entities that have an electric bolt connection from the object in the air to a building below and to the south.  These black entities are on what appears to be a porch structure of the building and appear to be ascending and descending from the object. I called the hotline and spoke with a gentleman who told me that there was no way I have seen 50 UFOs since October 27th! Local residents and I find that very disheartening since we have seen them every night since October 27th.  We have called the Pinellas County sheriff's Department twice Only to have the sheriff's take pictures with a full spectrum camera and then leave without reassuring residence we are safe or giving any type of comment whatsoever.  This is not a joke I don't appreciate the way my phone call to nuforc was handled. Here is your report and a couple of media clips of said event. I hope you take it seriously reconsider your stance so we can move forward for a resolution to put a large number of our towns minds at ease!   Five years ago my wife and I witnessed 2 orbs come from the intercoastal waterway and launch at a 45 degree angle into space, I have been an avid Skywatcher ever since.  I am 13 hours short from receiving my single engine private pilots license and live near 5 airports and an air force base.  I am very familiar with local private/commercial aircraft routes, leapfrog routes & landing routes.  This is not commercial or private aircraft, we do see many secret military aircraft come from and return to MacDill Air Force Base.  What we're seeing is beyond known aircraft beyond the T3RB that we witness dailY!;27.850827342048;-82.787462636165

It appeared to be four small round balls stuck together.  They each had a separate color, orange, green, red and blue.  They were moving counter clockwise. I stumbled for my phone to get this on tape while screaming for my boyfriend to call my sister a few streets away, as the video starts you will notice all of the other lights turn red and it takes off too fast to be anything that could fly, it returns rapidly with now white lights, it shoots more toward Indian Shores beach, it shoots back over Seminole and then gone.  It appeared to be heading east/south east. I own a Kyocera and they are very bad at night camera, but I did get a video of it.;27.850827342048;-82.787462636165
