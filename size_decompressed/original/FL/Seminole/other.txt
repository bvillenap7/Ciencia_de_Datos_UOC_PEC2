It didn't look like a migration, they looked scared.  After I pulled out my phone camera and started filming, as the crows were above us, me and my friend blacked out and started puking out of nowhere for no reason.  It was the worst puke i have ever had. i stopped puking before he did, and i was able to look at him, and he was hysterical, he was claiming that something was in his head a worm like thing he could feel it.  He said his throat felt like something was shoved down it.  We were the only ones on the trail at that very moment,  We were very scared, because there was no reason for this to be happening.  It was like something took control over our bodies.  I have a feeling this was the work of an extra-dimensional alien of some sort, I just cant exp! lain why or how.  Those crows were a cover for something. I just know it.;27.850827342048;-82.787462636165
