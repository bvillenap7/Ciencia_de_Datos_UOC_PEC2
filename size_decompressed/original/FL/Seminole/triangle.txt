Then I had a feeling that I was not alone. I turned around to go back inside, and I noticed a black triangle hovering over the tree line beside my house. It was very hard to see because it blended well with night sky. I walk out of the front door of my house to let the dog outside. I was staring at this star that seemed to pulsate. Then I had a feeling of not being alone. I turned to walk back inside my house when I noticed a Black triangle hovering over the tree line right beside my house. I watched it almost feeling like I couldnt move. It then began to move across the sky. It was very low maybe 200 Ft in the air. It had no lights and made absolutly no sound. It also moved very slow. I was thinking I have to get my wife out here to see this, but I couldn't move. I could only watch it moving across the sky. It blended very well with the night sky, and I don't think anyone would notice it if they weren't looking up. It turned around a giant tree and then was gone. I then ran inside my house to get my wife and when we returned outside it was still gone. I stayed awake all that night, very scared.;27.850827342048;-82.787462636165
2 triangles flying low in formation;2009-04-18 21:00:00;1 minute;2 triangles flying low in formation I was driving home from work getting close to home at or a bit before 9PM.  The sky was dark enough to be officially night time.  As I was headed West and came around a bend in the road I noticed 2 objects that I first thought were planes before I realized how low they were, 500' max, how large they were, and how slow they appeared to be going.  The 2 objects appeared as 3 points of light whose positions remained static relative to one another.  One had 2 lights that appeared to pulsate at different rates, on quicker than the other.  The other objects lights were all solid.  I stopped and rolled down the windows, but could hear no sound from the objects.  Both flew South-East, more south than east, and remained in formation for the whole time observed.  This path took them over my home and across our Lake towards my parents home, whom I spoke with this morning and discovered that they both were also witnesses.
