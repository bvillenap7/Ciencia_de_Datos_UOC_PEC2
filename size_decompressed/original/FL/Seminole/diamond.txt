A white 'diamond-shaped 'Star' erratically moving in the night-sky above Seminole/Largo, FL.;2015-06-03 21:30:00;30+ minutes;A white 'diamond-shaped 'Star' erratically moving in the night-sky above Seminole/Largo, FL At approximately 9:30+-, I was outside with my dogs. I looked up into the night sky, like anyone would, and saw a single very-bright 'Star' above with no other stars near it. I suddenly noticed movement of the 'Star' an erratic 'twisting' resembling saw-teeth and loops resembling the start of tying a knot. I stood and watched the 'Star' for about 30+- minutes and the 'Star' continued these movements, sometimes stopping and then starting again. I then called The National UFO Reporting Center, and tried to act on their suggestions - Using the compass on my phone, I was facing SE at approx. 135*, held it steady, and several times the 'Star' would change position south or east by 2 to 4 degrees - I attempted to get a video with my phone, but to no avail - I watched the 'Star' with glasses, readers, naked eye the movement did not change with any of them -  The 'Star' movement would 'light up' cloud formations as they passed, and then with another movement, the 'Star' would 'light up' the same cloud formation again, (the shapes of the cloud formations referred to was quite obvious) -  Several times I saw the 'Star' trailing an orange or faint-white 'exhaust trail' - I came back outside about 10:30 and, in a clear sky, the 'Star' is gone.;27.850827342048;-82.787462636165
