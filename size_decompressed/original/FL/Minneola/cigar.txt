The strangest thing I have ever seen.;1977-03-20 11:00:00;10 mins;The strangest thing I have ever seen. As a child with clear skys and wide awake. Around 11 am over my brothers school ((deleted--witness #1)), ((witness #2)), ((witness #3)), ((witness #4)), ((witness #5)), and I witnessed a cigar shaped object flying back and forth accrossed the sky north to south at great speed. The object had no writing or sysmbols on it. It was silver in color metalic if you would. When it stopped dead in the air for a few seconds (20 to 30) without any sound at all. Out of the distance we could all hear the sound of almost thunder like rumbling. I could a few seconds later see to what looked to be fighter jet screaming toward the object. We all looked with great wonder at what was happening. Then as the jets got closer the object seemed to be taunting the jets by reamaning still until they were within a 1/4 mile. then it took of so fast it was gone and out of sight before the jets were even over it location where it stood still. Heading off in the north west the jet flew over and seemed almost standing still after seeing what we had seen. I have never told but a hand full of people of this and just wanted to share this with you there. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));28.6;-81.7344
