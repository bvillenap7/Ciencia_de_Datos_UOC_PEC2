I was walking back to my car after attending the pinapple festival and my friend got a call on her cell phone.  Her friend told her to look up at Mars, it was near the moon. (by this time the moon/mars had set I think)  So, we look up at what we think might be Mars, it looks like a big bright star / planet in the sky. it had bright green / blue look to it.  So we look up, thinking that we are looking at Mars which was nice, but otherwise unremarkable.   Then the light which we think is Mars just takes off!  At first I think, did I just see a shooting star?  But there was no trail, not debris, no charged particles in the atmosphere. ' The light seemed to follow the curvature of the earth as we watched it exit over the horizon to the west. The event took about 15 to 20 seconds from the time we saw it until it left. ((NUFORC Note:  Mars should be visible until sun-up.  PD));27.2367837837838;-80.2269270270271
