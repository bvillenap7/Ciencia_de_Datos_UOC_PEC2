Two round, soundless lights flying from the ocean to the west.;2008-10-30 21:35:00;10 seconds;Two round, soundless lights flying from the ocean to the west. I was sitting on the patio facing east and saw two fast moving white/yellow round objects moving east to west just over the St. Lucie River inlet between Stuart and Jensen Beach.  I stood up to get a clear view before they moved out of sight.  The slower one dipped down and out of my line of sight.  They were flying as low as a news helicopter, but there was no sound.;27.2367837837838;-80.2269270270271

Red/orange sphere flew for about 3 mins. 3 seperate times then disappeared. captured whole thing on video.;2013-01-26 21:00:00;10 minutes;Red/orange sphere flew for about 3 mins. 3 seperate times then disappeared. captured whole thing on video. Hello. I took this video footage Saturday night of a UFO.  I had no idea what it was and still don't. It appeared 3 different times. I was able to capture 2 of them on good video.  I don't know what to do with them or how to handle it but I know this will go national news. It amazing video. It was a crystal clear night out and I noticed this red/orangeish glowing sphere. It flew the same pattern all 3 times. It started off close to the horizon and came towards me. I see planes and helicopters fly over all the time and you can always see a silouette and blinking lights and also hear them.  This was no plane or helicopter.  First of all, there was no silouette, no flashing lights and no sound. Plus, when it flew over, all the dogs in my nieghborhood started barking. It was totally round and moved in a specific way.  Then everytime, it flew basically the same pattern, hovered for a minute, then flew straight up and then disappeared.  All 3 times!  It was totally clear! too.  I have 2 excellent videos of this event and I know people are going to want to see this.  People are bugging me already to show it to them.  I haven't shown this to anybody yet and I was wondering if you were interested in working something out.;27.2367837837838;-80.2269270270271
