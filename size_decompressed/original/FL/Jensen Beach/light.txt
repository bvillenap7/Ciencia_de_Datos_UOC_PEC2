We were outside getting ready to grill and we saw approximately eight red lights in a v-shaped formation hovering in the sky.  The lights were equally spaced apart and there was no sound or movement.  One by one, each light faded until they were all gone.;27.2367837837838;-80.2269270270271
Three red dots in triangle formation;2011-12-31 22:00:00;15 seconds;Three red dots in triangle formation Me and my boyfriend were outside our house watching the fireworks when we saw three red dots in the sky in a triangle formation.  The dots kind of flickered from red to a white-ish color. Then after a few seconds two of them disappeared and the other one stayed present for a few more seconds then disappeared as well.  These lights weren’t blinking so we knew it wasn’t an aircraft, and it was very far away you could tell it was out in space.;27.2367837837838;-80.2269270270271

White bright light.  ((NUFORC Note:  Satellite re-entry??  PD))((anonymous report));2017-11-24 19:16:00;30 seconds;White bright light. It was a very bright light & very high up.  At the same time an airplane passed below that was also high but not as high as this was.  It was travel from the west heading East toward the ocean at a good steady speed. When all of a sudden it darted South and upward out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Satellite re-entry??  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
