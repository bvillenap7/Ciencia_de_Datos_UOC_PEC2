Round hovering ball of light (craft), no noise disappears after 3 minutes.;2017-08-15 21:30:00;3 minutes;Round hovering ball of light (craft) no noise, disappears after 3 minutes Around 9:30pm, I was leaving work with a coworker and standing outside, facing toward south west, not extremely high was a round craft which looked as it was lit from within a white/blueish color with a fog/haze around it,  There was an airplane which was flying much higher and it was obvious it was a plane, we heard it and all.   This was different.  It didn't appear to be flying but hovering over the area, we saw it for about 3 full minutes and then it disappeared right infringement of our eyes.   There was no sound or anything, it was also not a drone (our immediate thought at first) it was a large white round craft.;27.2367837837838;-80.2269270270271
