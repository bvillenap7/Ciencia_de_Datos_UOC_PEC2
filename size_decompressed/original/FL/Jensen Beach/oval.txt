I was outside at night when i seen a plane or meteor that was on fire. After staring and focusing on it, I realized i was looking at a UFO. It was shooting through the air when it stopped and hovered there. It was oval shaped. It then shot from side to side and in a 90 degreees motion in about 2 seconds coving 10's-100's miles. It was white colored and solid light. It then lit up even brighter and starting dimming. It shot across the sky. When an airplane was coming in the same direction, the object dimmed to no lights and vanished. I had a feeling either the plane scared it away or it had a feeling i we were watching it. I am still stoked to this day of this sighting.;27.2367837837838;-80.2269270270271
