Oval mass flashes red, green, white, then yellow in western sky;2008-07-31 00:00:00;over 40 mins;Oval mass flashes red, green, white, then yellow in western sky As we were getting ready to go to bed, about 11:30, or so. my companion happened to glance out of the bedroom window on the west side of our apartment.  He noticed a bright orb flashing green, red and white light.  He called to me and we watched it together.  It moved up, down and sideways.  It made quick sharp moves in a zig zag motion.  We went outside to look without having to look through the unremovable window screen.  It appeared even brighter when outside.  It began to move away and slightly fade.  Then, it became brighter again.  It is now 12:56 am and it is still there.  It is now changing from bright red to green to yellow, along with white.  It is brightly flickering.  It is on the move again, however, still in the same area.  The time is now 1:02am.  It is moving in an erratic pattern.  At 1:06 it vanished.;27.2367837837838;-80.2269270270271
