When I got off work i seen a formation of lights almost like 6 aircrafts lined up.  It was around 10:45 pm, January 25,2001.  I woke my sister up to notify her of the strange object, but when she came out it was gone.  She weent back inside and soon as she went back to bed, it came again. I begin pursuing the UFO in the woods to try and get a better look, i ended up at my neighbors house, they were sleeping so i didn't bother to disturb them.  The object was huge and silent and it was very bright.  it was in some sort of formation.  I had never seen it before but on unsolved mysteries.  Im sure that it was not a airforece craft.;30.5518;-81.8181
