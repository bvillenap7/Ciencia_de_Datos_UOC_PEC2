Quick moving ,very high;2003-08-15 16:00:00;1 second;Quick moving, very high I was walking down the sidewalk heading into downtown St. Petersburg. I looked up at a jet which was very high, heading SSW. The bay was to my right. I saw a craft very much higher, traverse the skydome , aboue a third of the sky was witnessed by me. The appearance and motion of the loftier craft was very reminiscent of shots from the shuttle of anomalous lights in the lower atmosphere. There seemed to be a pulse effect. It was moving so quickly that the speed must have been way beyond anything which our air forces have, anything I am aware of anyway. It was a pure luck deal. And if I had not been interested in such occurances, I certainly would never have noticed it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness describes himself as someone who is quite familiar with photography and complex operations.  We suspect he is a very good witness.   PD));27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294

I saw a floating fire ball object that stopped and hovered for a few minutes then shot off in the air, took a clear picture;2011-12-14 21:00:00;walking into home;I saw a floating fire ball object that stopped and hovered for a few minutes then shot off in the air, took a clear picture I was getting out of my car very slowly to walk into the house,I stopped and looked up to the sky.  I come from new york and have recently moved down to Florida I am amazed on seeing a clear sky full of stars, accept this night there was a over cast and very few many stars out.   As I looked up i saw a bright ball of fire floating up and to left, I originally thought it was a flare or one of those lanterns that you can light and they fly away.  Until it stopped and was just hovering the clous was behind it and it was bright yellow and orange like fire, I grabbed my cell phone and took a picture of it and as soon as i took a picture it started to move slow, so I took one more shot and it shot into the sky and it was gone.  I have seen planes and helicopters my whole life. I Never seen anything do what it did that night.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
Two metallic objects with bright orange tails like comets streaked across the sky;2015-12-19 17:45:00;20+ minutes;Two metallic objects with bright orange tails like comets streaked across the sky While walking home from an art show my girlfriend and I saw a silver metallic object that seemed to blink in and out of view flying across the sky.  It had a bright orange tail like that of a comet that never changed its length trailing behind it like some sort of propulsion.   Shortly after the first object began passing from view a 2nd object of the exact same appearance came into view following the flight path of the 1st object.   There are several airports in the area and planes are a very common sight in the skies around here but in the 5 years I have lived here I have never once seen anything quite like these two objects.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
