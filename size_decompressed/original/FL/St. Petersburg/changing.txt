While walking down the street something appeared in my peripheral vision.  Something was glowing to my right and this illumination was about 30 feet in the air.  As soon as my vision settled on the clump of mass, and my vision is ultra clear and good at distance viewing, the glowing orange yellow fire transformed into a ball object about basketball sized.  This ultra fast change appeared to be through a small explosion.  There was no shockwave or noise.  All of this happened in approximately 1.5 seconds.  100% quick rings then traveled across the front of the house.  This is what that ball changed in to.  It seemed the rings emerged simultaneously as the ball emerged and exploded from the growing clump of mass.  The rings were 3 or more feet in size and they kept their shape as they flashed and strobed.  They went from the street to the roof area of the house in what appeared to be a tiny sliver of time.  I was still able to track these parts through time.  These ring forms then combined into a single perfectly circular disk about 4 feet across.  This object was reveled to me in its unobstructed entirety.  I had a full frontal view of this disk.  It was stationary at the roof area of the house and perfectly circular.  It's coloration was off-white.  The object was not empty.  I saw shadows within.  They were about 2 feet long and narrow.  The sides of these shadowy objects were wavy.  There was not a flicker of movement as this disk levitated in front of me.  I gazed at it for approximately 2 seconds.  It then left my field of vision on a vanish.  It did not fade away or streak into the sky under some discernable propulsive power.  This single series of unique events occurred in the sequence I report.  The specific moments and incidents occurred at that time and place.  The events that happened will be remembered.  For the remainder of my life I will have a blast of total remote recall.  It will be remembered vividly.  On that morning something alien fully entered my consciousness.  Something unc! anny and mysterious inserted itself into my consciousness. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and he seemed quite sincere.  We received a large-scale map from the witness, which indicates where the object was sighted at a corner on 35th Avenue.  PD));27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
Strange changing object with different color lights and moving slowly, left to right, however staying in same location;2008-01-12 11:00:00;3 hours;Strange changing object with different color lights and moving slowly, left to right, however staying in same location For a period of 2-21/2 hours we watched this thing hover slowing moving from left to right, up and down.  It had a large glowing thing at the top when it was oblong, however it would change shapes and colors.  It was also there on 1/13/2008, the next day.  However, it was not there on Monday 1/14/2008.  Just hovered and moved slowly.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
Round shaped craft with 4 lights spotted over water at Fort De Soto Campground morphed shape into military grade looking plane.;2017-08-09 00:20:00;1-3 minutes;Round shaped craft with 4 lights spotted over water at Fort De Soto Campground morphed shape into military grade looking plane. My friend and I were camping at Fort De Soto.  As we were sitting outside by the campfire, a strange mist started to fall (not quite rain, but definitely could be felt on the skin), we found it strange because there was not a cloud above us.   As we were looking towards the sky to try and find where this mist was coming from we noticed what initially looked to be a plane in the sky that had a strange flight pattern heading towards us.  It was too far away to see much so we thought that maybe it was a plane in distress.  We decided to run past the trees into a field to get a better unobstructed view of it. At this point it was probably two football fields distance away from us and about as high as a helicopter is when they are searching for people on the ground (it was quite low).  A few things became apparent as this was happening…  1.  Both my friend and I got goosebumps all over our bodies (including our cheeks) and the hairs on our bodies stood up at the exact same time.  2.  It was now close enough to see the shape and what jumped out at us first was that it was round in the front with a cigar shaped tail (definitely unlike any plane we'd ever seen before-it had no wings!)  3.  It had absolutely no sound coming from it other than a low hum, and  4.  It was blacker in color than the night sky. It had 4 round white lights around the front which quickly morphed into 1 bright center light and then morphed back into 4 individual lights, again.   It then made a sharp U-turn towards our left, went into some trees for about 5 seconds to where we couldn't see it, and came back out and over us again heading in the opposite direction, only now in an entirely different shape!  It was now in the shape of a 4 engine military looking plane (completely different from its original shape).   It proceeded to head in the opposite direction away from us and into the trees where we could no longer get a visual on it.  About 30 seconds later the mist was completely gone.  The whole incident probably only took about 2-3 minutes.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
