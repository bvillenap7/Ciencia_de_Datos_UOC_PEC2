UFO seen in St. Pete, Fl;1985-06-01 14:30:00;minutes;UFO seen in St. Pete, Fl This all happened back in 1985/86 time frame during summer months.  My girl friend and myself was driving East bound on 38th Ave N. in St.Petersburg, FL, just east of 275. The black object was just hovering above a home on the north side of the street.  As you may or may not know, MacDill Airforce Base is located just east of St Pete, across Tampa Bay.  This object was not from MacDill!  I could make a clay relica that would give a more realistic shape.  After moving back to the area, I recently contacted my ex-girl friend, and we both still think about it and talk to others about the experience.
