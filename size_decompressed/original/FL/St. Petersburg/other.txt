Bluish object hovering,then gone.;1991-06-13 20:00:00;5-10 seconds;Summary:  Bluish object hovering,then gone. On the aforementioned night, my mother, my brother and I were taking a walk around our neighborhood.  We were almost home, and as I was looking up at the sky I noticed an intensly lit object.  It was small, because it was at a pretty high altitude.  It looked like two balls attached to each other by a rod (i.e. O-O)  It moved around erraticly with apparently random course.  Then, it streaked off to the south at a speed faster than any airplane would ever be able to reach.  Then it was gone.  I didn't say anything to my mom, but in later years I have mentioned it to my brother.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
A seeming military aircraft in the air that does not move and is NOT a helicopter.;2011-05-08 12:00:00;90 seconds+;A seeming military aircraft in the air that does not move and is NOT a helicopter. This sighting occurred on a clear day and on the surface the object did not appear to be a UFO.  It appeared to be a military aircraft (not a helicopter),- but it was not moving... at all. It's elevation was low enough to be descending to land.  I understand that only a rare marine aircraft can do that for a maximum of 90 seconds and then only when the wind is considerable.  There was no wind. This sighting, my first, was noteworthy mainly because the craft look like a photograph of an airplane in the sky.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
Bright blue very fast boomerang shaped light sighted over St. Petersburg, FL;2011-12-15 00:30:00;3 seconds;Bright blue very fast boomerang shaped light sighted over St. Petersburg, FL I was in my backyard letting my dog out. It was pretty quiet out. I just happened to look up in the sky and I saw a boomerang shaped bright blue/silvery light streak across the sky very fast.  Before it left my field of vision it abruptly disappeared and was no longer visible.  It made no noise.  I think it was pretty close because I am nearsighted although it did appear pretty small from where I stood.  The whole event only lasted a few seconds but it was definitely there.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
While walking my dog , I saw a star like object move and disappeared .;2014-02-04 19:30:00;3 minutes;While walking my dog , I saw a star like object move and disappeared . FEBUARY 4 , 2014 , TUESDAY AROUND 7:30 PM.  I was walking my dog around 7:30 pm , glanced over towards the west and  a star caught my eye . What was different it was moving.  I was using the telephone pole and powers lines as a eye guide . When it flew wwn it gradually went up and down , not up and down fast , like it was in a turbulence or somewhat . Then it starting to fade to nothing or maybe the direction that it was going could have been heading north . There was no flashing red light , no sound and after it disappear a smaller plane was coming up with a flashing red light like it going to the area where it disappeared . North of me there is airport and to the east three airports , all within 10 to 30 mins driving .  While this star was moving there were planes flyng northeast , east and south with flashing red lights . Since I was walking my dog I couldn't get my smartphone out in time to take a video or pictures . The star moved and disappeared around 3 mins . To the best of my knowledge this looked like a star . Some nights you can see falling stars but they moved differently , but no this was a star like object in our air space .;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
Crescent shaped UFO grace the sky and head towards the moon on St. Pete Beach.;2014-10-05 02:45:00;~10 seconds;Crescent shaped UFO grace the sky and head towards the moon on St. Pete Beach Walking along the beach after my sweet 16 birthday party, it was around 2:45 - 3:00 in the morning.  I was showing my friends my favorite star cluster, the Pleiades.  Upon explaining why I like them so much, one of my four friends with me pointed at the sky and said, Whoa, what is that?  We all looked quickly.   My best friend and I saw what we can only describe as a fast moving object in the shape of a half circle, with a little dip in the middle, flying towards the moon on the horizon.  It was relatively far away, as if it was just gracing ((sic.  Grazing)) our atmosphere, but it was still pretty big.   It was the color of the sky, which was black since it was nighttime, except a few shades lighter so, like a blueish-grey.   It was moving fast, but slow in the same time just very smoothly.  It headed towards the moon, until finally it faded out.   My sister, and friend that pointed out the UFO, say they saw something with red lights that kind of looked like an airplane.  However, they were under the influence of drugs that night, where as my best friend and I were not.   After seeing the UFO, I got a very happy and bubbly feeling in my chest.  It was amazing!  I will never forget that night.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294

Object with two lights moving erratically after green fireball dissipated.;2017-02-06 21:00:00;3-4 minutes;Object with two lights moving erratically after green fireball dissipated. This report is not about the green fireball I saw but what I saw afterward. 2/6/17 I was walking my dog and something made me look up.  I saw a large green fireball which then disappeared.  I think I heard a very slight sound, sort of a crackling which may be why I looked up.  The sound made me think it was a flare, but I know that was not a flare.  Also, I believe I saw some red dots over to one side of the fireball. When the fireball was gone I continued to watch the sky because I didnâ€™t know what may happen next.  Then I saw two tiny dots traveling together like headlights.  But these were so far away there was no glare to them.  It was moving in the same little cloud area that the fireball was in.  This vehicle (?) was moving up, down, sideways, left & right and finally down on a right angle then it got covered by the little cloud.  I stood and watched to see if it would come from behind the cloud and eventually it did but got covered again. Anyone seeing this would agree that this vehicle was searching for something.  It moved at a  slow pace and in erratic directions. FYI it was a cool clear evening, although there were white clouds here & there visibility of  the stars  and cloudless part of the sky were beautifully clear.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
There were three dots in a straight line slowly moving for a while then boom vanish!;2020-04-30 23:49:00;7 minutes;There were three dots in a straight line slowly moving for a while then boom vanish! I was up late and playing GTA V and scrolling facebook at the same time. While scrolling I saw a post saying, did you see that in the sky just now? So I went outside and I looked each way I could but didn't see anything. I moved to the road to get a clearer view and I noticed the stars, and I noticed the North Star, so I turn and I noticed other bright lights. It was 3 lights in a line, the were moving very slow and then they sped up and vanished.  I didn't think much of it and my partner and I went to sleep not long after.  The next morning I woke up and went about my normal day but then I scrolled through facebook again and noticed other people talking about it on live videos and posts . I started looking online to see if there were any real reports and there were none but this website popped up so I decided to contribute what just happened.  I am in St. Petersburg Florida and this was around 11:49pm to 12:30 somewhere in there.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
