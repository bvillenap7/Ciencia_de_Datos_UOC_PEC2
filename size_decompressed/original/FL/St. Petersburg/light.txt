Nightmare of UFO attack preceds actual UFO sightings by 24 hours, coincidence?;1978-08-27 03:00:00;20 minutes;Nightmare of UFO attack preceds actual UFO sightings by 24 hours, coincidence? I recently obtained my first computer and have spent the last couple of months learning how to use it.  I have also recently discoverd coasttocoast on am radio and have been listing to it nearly every night.  Some of the stories we hear on it have brought back a flood of memories to my wife and I.   I have two stories which occurred about 24 hours apart.  I don't know if they are somehow related or just coincidence.  I think it's important to relay that I am a G.I. Brat who was raised on Air Force Bases throughout the US as well as Germany and England.   Shortly after high school I joined the Air Force where I was trained as an Air Traffic Controller.  After leaving the service, my girl friend (now my wife of 26 years) and I took a trip from Ohio to Florida.  While in route to Florida we stopped to spend the night in my van.  During the wee morning hours of Aug 26, 1978, I recall having the scariest most vivid nightmare of my entire life.  I woke up screaming at the top of my lungs, scaring my girlfriend of two weeks to death.  For years I could recall in vivid detail the majority of the nightmare.   But now, two and a half decades later, I can only remember bits and pieces.  I can recall running and hiding in the ruins of city buildings, dodging ray like beams which were fired from numerous disc shaped craft hovering over the city.  I don't remember seeing any movies prior to this dream that might have led to it, but since the dream, I've seen many war of the world type movies that always bring back little flashes of my nightmare.   My wife says I screamed for a long time after my dream, and even after I stopped, it took me quite a while to completely wake up and overcome the dream induced fear that took quite a few minutes to shake.  I remained shaken all the next day as we drove the rest of the way to Florida.   The first thing we wanted to do was see the beach.  So, at about 3 AM on Aug 27, 1978, we were laying on our backs in the sand on St. Pete Beach.  It was a beautiful totally clear night and we noted that the stars never looked so bright in Ohio.  A bright star caught my attention as it seemed to get brighter and bigger over a couple of minutes period.  We were trying to decide rather it was actually an airplane or if our eyes were just tricking us for starring so long.  It seemed to be at least five times larger than any other star in the sky, then it started.  It seemed like a normal size star had emerged from the larger one, then another.  At this point they had our undivided attention.  The smaller ones darted back and forth in erratic fashion for several minutes then darted off faster than any aircraft that I have ever seen before or since.  We talked about what we had just seen when several more darted out of what we were now calling the mother ship, and in like fashion darted around occasional disappearing as though they had gone back inside, zipping off into the distance etc.  As best we can remember there were between 6 to 8 lights that we watched come and go in no particular combinations.  Sometimes only one at a time sometimes groups of mixed numbers.  We watched in amazement for twenty minutes or more.  We can't recall rather or not any or all of the little lights had retuned to the big one, because what happend next kind of made what we had been watching insignificant.  The largest light hovering over Tampa Bay was obviously getting bigger and bigger and seemed to be comming in our direction.  What once looked like the largest star in the sky soon became the size of a dime at arms length, then a quarter.  As it grew larger it turned to a bright reddish orange.  By this time we were on our feet and my girlfriend was tugging on my arm trying to get me to leave.  It was at about this point that the quarter size light which seemed to be miles out to sea accelerated so quickly that in a matter of a couple of seconds it was directly overhead and appeared larger than the sun in the sky.  The beach lit up as though it was high noon as it soared over us.  At this point I had no choice but to run as my girlfriend was already heading for the van.  We did'nt have far to run, but by the time we got in the van, the light had disappeared inland over St Pete.  We argued over rather or not to leave for less than a minute, then we could see the reddish orange ball returning in our direction very rapidly.  As one of us was now screaming bloody murder and jumping up and down, I thru it into drive and sped away.  There is absoluteley no doubt in our minds that we saw an extremeley large space craft which sent out a half dozen or so scout ships to explore the area over Tampa Bay and the city of St Pete Fl.  What we are unsure of is rather or not the nightmare the night before and the actual sightings are somehow connected.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294

I looked up in the sky (higher than many of the clouds) and saw a bright light that was flashing green and red. We went inside and got binoculars in order to get a closer look.  It appeared to have 2 green lights on the bottom, one green light on the top and a red light circling around in the middle. We watched it in one spot for about one hour when it started to fade away and within 2-3 minutes it just disappeared. We have no idea what we saw.  Definitely was not a plane or helicopter because it didn't move for 1 hour.  Not a tower because it was over the Gulf of Mexico and I don't think it was a satellite, because it was flashing distinct red and green lights and I do not believe satellites look like that in the sky. Did anyone happen to see this recently as well?;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
3 BRIGHT  STAR/LIGHT Object of Varying Colors Seen Over Pinellas Beaches /Tampa Bay, Florida;2007-09-09 20:10:00;45-60 minutes;3 BRIGHT  STAR/LIGHT Object of Varying Colors Seen Over Pinellas Beaches /Tampa Bay, Florida Sunday 9th September 2007 8:10 pm St.Petersburg,Florida 33705   At about 8:10 pm I had noticed for the 3rd night in a week a bright star/light  like object in the sky over the Gulf Beaches (St.Petersburg,Madeira, Treasure Island ) area. The object appeared to be a bright star/light and would change colors from red, white and greenish blue. This was a very fast color change that took place. If you had blinked you would have almost missed it .  The object had appreard to sit idle for sometime in the sky as if were waiting for direction . While sitting idle hoovering in the western sky over the gulf of mexico, it would dim and then just about fade out completely and then become super brilliant in color , always maintaining a star/light like shape or visual appearance to the naked eye. Its movements were not what one would think an airplane could do almost zig zagged at times and seemed to disperse a very faint light like flare or a spark if you will , sent out in any direction.  After a few minutes I telephoned a friend who had witnessed the same type of star/light like object a week prior to what I was observing at the moment and had for the past 3 nights . I asked her to describe what her and her daughter had seen in the skys over Clearwater the week prior because I was watching an object that was very similiar in nature to what they had witnessed. (Clearwater is About 30 minutes from St.Petersburg.)  She described that same light pattern , Star/light like appearance of the object and the same idle and cruising pattern as I had observed and the movements of the object, we talked for almost ten minutes about the object as they searched the sky south west of their home for what  was being  described to them .  The object began to pick up speed and was out of my eye range in seconds (blocked by a ten story building) as it headed east north east over towards Tampa Bay .  Just then I spotted a second Star/light like object with the same pattern of lights, movement and flight path as the first. This object appeared out of no where just like the first had .  My friends couldnt see much due to the Clouds over their area. I wished them a good night and would keep them posted as to what was observed at night . I ended the call and researched on the pc about any sightings in this area or across the state of florida this month or the month prior . Your site had come up on the search and here is my post.  I observed a 3rd object just as typing this post was nearing an end . The object my friend had witnessed was reported to be in the AM some time around 4:30 am - 5:30 am .  The objects that were witnessed by myself appeared between 8:00pm - 9:00pm .  Hopefully others have seen these objects and will have similiar accounts to tell . Best Wishes, Spotted in St.Petersburg;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294

Starnge light appears in Tampa Bay for 5-10 minutes then disappears.  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star, or Venus??  PD));2010-06-11 20:10:00;apprx. 5-10 min;Starnge light appears in Tampa Bay for 5-10 minutes then disappears. As my family and I were out fishing on the pier we were waiting to see the sun go down.  My son noticed a plane flying high in the sky, but I noticed something much higher.  At first my husband said it was a star, but I said no it was way to low to be a star.  I watched it for about 5 minutes and it just seemed to stay in one spot.  It was very bright and almost seemed to twinkle different colors.  We all looked at it for awhile.  Then one of my kids saw a dolphin in the water. When we looked back up after a couple of minutes the object was gone. My husband and I are both school teachers and our children are 13 & 15.  We have never seen anything like this before.  At one point we said possibly a satellite, but the ones we have spotted in the past were moving.  We enjoy looking at the stars and have seen a meteor shower but we do not actively look for things out of the ordinary.  I would like to know if there is anyone else who may have seen this as well.

One photo of gold V shaped object, like a boomerang with bright light surrond I was at the Sweet Bay Supermarket on 10-15-2011, when everyone in the store noticed the sky turned purple so quickly.  Many of us ran out of the stores to get pictures of this amazing sky phenomenon.  I grabbed my cell phone and started just taking pictures.   Many people were pointing up at something in the sky.  I thought it was just for the colors, they were totally unusual.  Today 1-17-2011, I went to work to show everyone the pictures I took.   Then you can imagine how shocked I was when there were many more objects in the sky that night.  My cell phone picked up 2 separate sets of 3 v shaped lights.  The 3rd picture was even more defined then the first two. It shows a gold V shaped image surrouned by light.   We emailed to my bosses computer to get a closer look.  We all gasped OMG!  I am sending you these images as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
10-12 rapidly moving orange lights, low to the ground and silent.;2013-03-06 19:50:00;10 minutes;10-12 rapidly moving orange lights, low to the ground and silent. Hello,  This is Vicky from St. Petersburg,  I talked just recently with you on the phone. I  looked into determining the wind direction in St. Pete. The winds are in fact blowing from NNW.   However, I believe I reported the direction incorrectly in my original report as NE to SW.  After looking more carefully at a map I realized that the objects were coming from the NNW so it is possible they are lanterns.  I will call the FAA tomorrow to see if I can get wind speed data. I apologize for my mistake, but like many women I'm a bit direction-ally challenged.  Thanks so much, ((name deleted));27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294

Sitting on porch, looking at sky, and saw what I thought was a bright star to the left of Venus and slightly above it.  I sit on porch all the time and never seen it before then no more than five seconds after turning my head slightly I saw the light pulsate out of the corner of my eye and when I turned my head to look it was gone.   I stood up to get better look and could not find the light anywhere.  I could still see Venus, but I didn't see the light return or show up in another spot.  It really puzzled me and I stayed outside for another 20 minutes and it never returned.   What could it of been?;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294

Strange Object Drifts Across Early Morning Sky;2020-08-11 05:30:00;5 minutes;Strange Object Drifts Across Early Morning Sky I was feeling insomnia early this morning and decided to go out for a smoke.  I looked up at the sky as I often do and wondered to myself what that big bright star is in the sky. Facing East I could see the moon to my right (ESE) high in the night sky obscured by clouds as thunder and lightning played behind me (WSW).  I remember focusing on the large star to the East when I saw movement to the left (ENE) of my perception of the moon. I would say it was high and very distant.  It passed in front of the moon and continued in the South Easterly direction until it seemed almost to travel too far away from me, relative to my position on the ground, because it faded as though a car has driven too far away and you cannot spot it any longer. It moved very slowly and had no blinking lights. Its course was very steady, not like a flying bug or insect. It was barely a pinprick in size but was clearly visible due to sparse cloud cover and the brilliance of the moonlight. ! I knew it was not a plane or helicopter and assumed it was perhaps a satellite or the International Space Station. I watched reference videos of the ISS flybys to see if what I saw was different and I can only say that the difference to me appears to be the size of the light (The ISS appears to have been bigger light, bigger in the sense of its overall circumference, then what I witnessed) and that the object fell away from the planet. It did not disappear over the horizon. I cannot be certain if the object was in motion or not before my initial observance.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
Bright Red/Orange pulsating orb above the tree line.;2020-11-26 22:00:00;3 minutes;Traveling in a car, three adults saw a bright red/orange pulsating orb above the tree line. 10 minutes later, while traveling back home we decided to take the same route to see if the orb was still there. We were in shock to find that the orb was in the same place just hovering still with no sound. I asked my husband to pull over so I could get out of the car to get a better look. As I got out of my car the orb glided over to my direction. The orb was now directly above my head. The pulsating light was beautiful and extremely bright. After hovering over my head, just above the tree line, the orb lifted up high into the sky with speed and then started to slowly glide down the road.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
