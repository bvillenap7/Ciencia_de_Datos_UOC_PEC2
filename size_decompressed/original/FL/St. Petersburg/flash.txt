Quick white flashing streak that turned greenish and fully disappeared into the tree line.;2019-04-22 01:11:00;10 seconds;Quick white flashing streak that turned greenish and fully disappeared into the tree line. We were driving south on I-275 when my friend and I saw the supposed UFO.  We knew it could not be an airplane or shooting star because it was far too low in the sky.  It was in the middle of the sky going into the tree line.  It started as a whitish flash, almost like a shooting star, that went across the highway and then turned into a greenish bluish flash then fully disappearing.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
White bright quick light;2021-03-27 02:00:00;~2 seconds;White bright quick light We went to the beach to have a late night drink around 1am, in St. Petersburg, Florida. There were 4 of us sitting on a blanket and talking for about an hour. My sister, cousin and I were looking at the hotels down the strip of the beach. All of a sudden, we saw a white, bright, round looking shape, that quickly appeared. It looked like it shot up in the sky because you could see a slight tail from the light follow it. It was very bright and a significant size for something in the sky.  It moved horizontally and darted back into the distance, all within a second or two. I  would say it disappeared for a millisecond and reappeared really far away as it moved.. the bright light was dimmer and smaller because of the distance, but you could still see how intense it was.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
