Encounter with disked shape UFO on campus of Florida Presbyterian College with 30 others;1970-03-10 00:00:00;less than hour;Encounter with disked shape UFO on campus of Florida Presbyterian College with 30 others   This happened on the campus of Eckerd College (then called Florida Presbyterian College) in St. Petersburg, Florida. Don't remember the exact date, sometime in 1970, I believe in the spring.  There were about 30 of us watching a movie, The African Queen in the Student Union in the middle of campus. The movie was over around midnight, and we all walked out of the building. There, hovering approximately 20 feet above the ground in the open area near the Student Union, was a disk shaped, grey metallic craft. It was not small, I'm guessing approx. 50 feet wide. It had red lights in a band around the middle of the craft. It was completely silent, and was not moving.  I had the feeling that time stopped, we all stopped moving, stood where we were, as if frozen in time. No one said a word. I don't know how much time past. The next thing I remember is that the craft lifted straight up, made a perpendicular movement, then straight up again, and was gone. Its speed was faster than one could even imagine. No acceleration time, it was at a standstill, then gone.  No one said a word, we all just walked back to our dorm rooms on campus. This was very out of character, because this was a very radical 60's type college, with a very verbal student body! I was walking back to my dorm with a friend, and were walking very slowly, as if walking through mud. I said to her, Maybe we should tell someone and she said No, don't bother. When I got to my dorm, I called the TV station (left a message) and the police (who didn't believe me).  That was it. No one ever spoke about it. I forgot about it almost immediately. Then I started remembering it in detail around 20 years later. This was the only time in my life I saw a UFO.  If any of the 30 people who shared this experience with me that night in 1970 on the campus of Florida Presbyterian College also remembers this event, please report it on this site.

Rare sighting of ufo formation shadow on the ground.;1977-07-12 14:00:00;2 minutes;Rare sighting of ufo formation shadow on the ground. I was 14 years old at the time, and was playing in a vacant lot across from my parents house. I was picking up rocks to hit with an old baseball bat, when I suddenly notice a shadow move right between my legs, heading north. It was the shadow of 6 perfect, unattached circles, moving at about walking pace. From my perspective, each circle on the ground was about the size of an over-sized dinner plate. This was a perfectly sunny and cloudless day, but when I looked up toward the sky to see the cause of the shadow, there was nothing. It was quite amazing to me, I remember, that I couldn't see what was causing the shadow, despite it's large dimensions. Any other craft casting a shadow that large would have been easily spotted in the sky. I followed the shadow for about 20 yards until the yard ran out and thich hedges obstructed me. My first immediate reaction was to run inside to tell my parents (since my father had a sighting in 1962, of a green cigar in the night sky over Treasure Island, FL), so I knew that he would ubderstand. My first impression was that I thought that these craft had to be cloaked in some way, maybe by turning the bottoms of the craft to match the clear blue sky.

saucer shaped craft that hovered before shooting up into  space.;2000-10-03 02:15:00;15 mins;saucer shaped craft that hovered before shooting up into  space. It was spinning at about 30 to 45 seconds per turn. A red light would go around at  the afore mentioned time. It was located at N NE of the location I spotted and moved west very quickly but only short distances and hovered for about 20 mins. before shooting upward at a very high speed. Abright light shone down from   tthe craft for about 15-20 seconds. I could plainly see it was shaped like a disk and that it rotated constantly. ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports from this area.

disk slowly moving laterally  and then hovering with white light.;2001-06-10 07:00:00;5 minutes;disk slowly moving laterally  and then hovering with white light. I was driving home with my brother as passenger on 4th st.N heading south when my attention was drawn to look to my left through the driverside window to see a gold disk-shaped object above the treeline which appeared to be pacing us at about 40 mph. I turned to my brother to tell him to look at it.  He saw it by looking up through the sunroof so it must have moved up higher. I turned right off 4th st. and stopped to observe it for about 4 minutes which it was now stationary and about 45 degrees up with a white light omitting off it. We left for home leaving it behind and the next morning I went back to the same spot at the same time just to view the sky to see if there is anything that I could have mistaken it for. No stars, nothing.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
noted a disc shaped object 40-50 ft in diameter flying towards macdill AFB at liw and at very high speeds.;2007-01-01 15:00:00;2 minutes;noted a disc shaped object 40-50 ft in diameter flying towards macdill AFB at liw and at very high speeds. I went to my garbage can, where i hear a strange electrical hum...somewhat like the sound of a bicycle chain rattle on top of that.  The object was above me, it was a disc with lights around the edges, though it also appeared to have red and green lamps like a normal aircraft.  it moved at almost a jog, 10-15 miles per hour.  it continued away from me ..then slowly banked towards Tampa, home of centcom. It then accelerated to a very high speed, and was instantly gone. the object flew slower then any modern aircraft. any known. It accelerated in a way that is impossible for a normal aircraft.i have noted that it resembles an x-47b with a rounder shape...and is also similar in size. the recent pics of an x-47 being moved, under a cover , with wings removed... was a very similar shape.
