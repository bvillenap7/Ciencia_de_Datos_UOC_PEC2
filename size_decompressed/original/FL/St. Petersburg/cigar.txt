something strange in the sky;1999-09-07 05:10:00;15-30sec;something strange in the sky At approximately 5:10 a.m. on Tuesday Sept.7,I was working in St. Petersburg, Fl.  I looked out of the dock door between the trailer and the top of the door. I saw something I did not recognize.  I told my co-worker to look at that.  He asked me what I was looking at.  We both moved one door south and looked out.  Traveling from north to south was an object that I only could describe as a glass cigar tube with smoke in it and three equally spaced blue lights.  It was not foggy that night.  The moon was clearly visible.  We watched this for approx. 20-30 seconds.  There was no sound at all.  We are 1/2 mile from St. Pete/Clearwater airport where the Coast Guard fly C1-30's out of.  When they come in, it rattles our building.  There was no sound.  I first saw it when I was facing west.  It traveled south approx. 70-80 degrees and disappeared.  I then went to the east side of the dock and went out on the apron to see if I could see it.  I saw nothing.  I could not tell altitude or size or speed.  We were listening to 970WFLA.  Approx. 20 minutes after we saw this, the station said they were swamped with call of lights in the sky.  I do not know exactly what I saw, but I know that the news explanation that night of a Russian rocket booster traveling at 17,000 mph did NOT satisfy my curiosity.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294

I followed it and it went to my home and just sat hovering over my house and it didn't make a sound it moved very strange it could move as slow and fast as it wanted,it turned by just pivoting around standing still.I felt like it was showing  watching   me that it knew I was watching it and it was watching me.It turned and I was trying to follow but it just bolted,it was gone,  Two days later it was over a plublic bus station hovering just watching,which is not that far from my home.I remember both of the days I seen the ufo were cloudy.  I never told anyone because they might think I was crazy.It had big lights all the way around it and almost got the feeling it knew more about me than I knew about it.

It just looks like it doesn`t belong there.;2008-12-17 00:00:00;3 frames;It just looks like it doesn`t belong there. As I was viewing the (weather bug) on my computor, I moused over to Live Camera from Environmental Science Academy Crystal River, Florida   Please view the first few daylight shots from live camera and notice the object in 3 of the frames.   It sure looks like a cigar shaped object to me.  I do not know the elapsed time between shots, but it seems the object is moving pretty slow for being airborn.  It doesn`t appear to be a helocopter on my screen.  Please let me know what you think.  ((e-address deleted));27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
