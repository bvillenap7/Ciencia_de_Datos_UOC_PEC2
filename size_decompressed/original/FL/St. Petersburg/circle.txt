Circular object flying overhead;2003-11-16 19:30:00;one hour;Circular object flying overhead I was walking my dog, who always has her nose to the ground in her search for scents. My dog has never bothered to look at birds flying around her. I thought nothing of it when she looked up at the sky. Then she proceeded to sniff the ground and, again stopped suddenly to look upwards. This time I also looked up. I saw a huge round object flying above the treetops. It had lights on the outer edges that were going around. It was not solid but looked like a slide projection on the clouds. Except this projection travelled south over our roof and disappeared. i went inside and told my wife. This time we left the dog inside and went outside. There it was again! The phenomenon was witneessed by another apartment resident doing her laundry.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
Grey circle gliding in the sky;2005-05-27 21:26:00;1-2 minutes;Grey circle gliding in the sky At 9:26 pm I was heading to my car to take my grandfather home.  I looked up into the sky to look at the Big Dipper and after looking at it for a few seconds I noticed a grey circle floating in the sky. It was the size of a pencil's eraser.  Anyway, it was gliding across the sky in a perfect straight line, no wiggling at all, very steady, and at a constant speed.  I would also say that it was stayed at a continuous height because it didn't get smaller or larger while it moved.  There was also no sound at all. It was completely silent.  So I tried to show it to my grandfather but his eyesight isn't that great.  Then I banged on my brother's window to get him to come outside and bring me my binoculars.  He came out but he was impatient and didn't see anything.  By this time it was going behind my roof so I decided to move in between my house and my next door neighbor's house to continue to watch it.  Unfortunately, I lost it. I knew that it was NOT a bird because I've seen birds at night before. And it was definitely NOT a plane because there were no lights whatsoever. I really wish I had had my binoculars!;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
2 parallel sets of Circular chasing style lights hovering, then landing near Park Street in Pinellas County, Florida;2007-03-26 23:40:00;5 minutes;2 parallel sets of Circular chasing style lights hovering, then landing near Park Street in Pinellas County, Florida 03/26/2007 St Petersburg, FL, Approx: 11:40 pm  While sitting in our backyard, facing east towards Park Street in St Petersburg, my husband noticed 3 bright chasing style lights shooting rapidly from side to side and then hovering over what would seem to be Park Street and 63rd Avenue in St Petersburg.  As the object got closer, we noticed 2 sets of these lights, one right on top of the other (kind of like the chaser lights you would use at Christmas time, only larger).  It probably sat in the sky for about 15 seconds, and then started to descend straight down.  There seemed to be an aura coming from underneath the object, but it wasnâ€™t very bright.  There were no sounds coming from the craft at all.  Shortly after it disappeared behind the trees, (maybe 10 minutes or so later) we both noticed a small airplane flying through the same area and then seconds after that, 2-3 helicopters, possibly from the National Coast Guard (they were red & white), were flying around the same area. We also noticed that no commercial flights flew into Tampa International Airport for at least 45 minutes to an hour after we saw the object.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294

Two, reddish orange balls appeared in the northern sky over St. Petersburg,  FL.;2014-07-04 22:30:00;5 minutes;Two, reddish orange balls appeared in the northern sky over St. Petersburg,  FL. My family was setting off fireworks.  At around 10:30pm two reddish/orange spheres appeared in the northern sky.   My husband and I noticed the glowing balls above the treeline.  They were moving at a slow pace, almost seemed to hover moving from west to east.  They appeared hazy. At first I thought thet were fireworks, but they hung there for a couple of minutes then moved slowly to the east, just above the treeline.  After about five minutes, they just disappear.  We (my husband and I) did not say anything to each other. Aproximately a half hour later my husband said to me, What about those glowing balls?   At the time, I had no idea anyone else had noticed them.  So when he said that, I felt varified.  We started to tell each other what we had witnessed.  We saw the same thing. I noticed that others, in Florida, as well as neighboring states, had  witnessed the same sightings.   The same reddish/orange glowing hazy balls in the night sky.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
