What is it? This siteing has been on my mind for almost 10 years and I would really would like to know what happened to us that summer night.   We (my xwife and I) were awakened at 4:20 in the morning my a electric sound almost like standing next to a loud generator, not the engine part but the humming sound.  We both sat up on the bed at turned around and looked outout bedroom window and we saw a orange sphere about 9 feet to 10 feet across. It looked like the sun but through a filter so you could see the makeup of the light , sorta like the sun when shown on t.v.  It hovered just 2 feet off the ground and we watched it for a solid 20 minutes until it lifted up and slowley floated around trees and over our busy (not then) 4 lane road and watched as it floated up and over the homes across the street and after 40 minutes it looked like a orange spec next to the other stars.  My wife turned to me and said   what the h%&# did you bring home with you?  The reason for that comment was because 2 days before 130 miles North at my hunting property I witnessed a black triangle that was just above my head ( no witness on this one)  I heard it ( sounded like air being drawn through a hose)  and it shot off -  I had five and half hours of missing time.   Since then I have had two other close encounters, one very involved the same week and one years later,.  Someone out there in the Government  knows whats going on and I am tired of waiting for them to come clean,  I'm getting fustrated trying to find out the truth.  What a bunch of liars they are saying they don't know anything when I know for a fact we are being visited, we have the right!  The strange thing was, was;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
Translucent red globe dances with the clouds over St. Petersburg, FL.;2000-08-14 18:45:00;10 minutes;Translucent red globe dances with the clouds over St. Petersburg, FL. I was watching the sunset from my dock.  A storm system was quickly moving in from the west to the south.  Because I had been watching the sunset, I was wearing sunglasses.  They are non-reflective, but they amplify anything that is red.  As I watched the progress of the storm, I saw a translucent red sphere appear to streak from south to west disappearing behind a cloud.  I thought it was a simple reflection off the lenses, so I removed them and looked again.  I saw the globe drop out from behind one cloud, travel straight down, and take cover behind another cloud.  This behavior continued for about ten minutes, until the storm moved closer to me and I was forced to go inside.  I live near several airports, and a military base, but this was unlike anything I have seen before.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
starlike objects with very distinct flashing, colored lights.;2005-11-24 22:30:00;+1 hour;starlike objects with very distinct flashing, colored lights. Saw with naked eye two starlike (in size and shape) objects in E / SE sky with very bright flashing red, blue, white, and green lights. Sky brilliant and clear. They were about as far apart as the whole constellation of Orion and were located about 15 degrees below Orion.These objects did not move at all. Watched for an hour.They were there the following night. Waiting for clear night when we can look to see if they are still there. Are these satellites or something the government has up there? We looked with binoculars and the flashing is VERY DISTINCT. Not a natural sky object. Definitely man (?) made.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
Orange lights moving over St Petersburg, FL;2011-11-12 19:20:00;5 minutes;Orange lights moving over St Petersburg, FL Orange lights flying from east to west.  From our vantage point we saw the lights fly over MacDill Airforce Base continuing over Coffee Pot Bayou and then completely vanish.  These objects flew directly overhead and were completely silent -  They came in sets of two and three.  They moved in straight lines and appeared to be circular.  The color was a very distinct orange. There was no tail.  Whatever these were they made absolutely no noise, traveled very fast, and then would simply disappear in an instant.  They came in 4 sets of waves.   We know other's must have witnessed these objects as well as it occoured early in the night.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
Orange Reddish sphere heading west in the sky rapidly and disappeared into a small dot.;2013-05-26 21:30:00;2-3 minutes;Orange Reddish sphere heading west in the sky rapidly and disappeared into a small dot. My friend and I were outside on our front porch and happened to look over towards the eastern sky.  An orange/red ball like light was approaching heading west.  We stepped off the porch into the yard to get a better look and noticed a flare like light around the object. There was no noise emanating from it engine, propeller or otherwise.  It seemed to be moving at a pace more quickly than a plane but the duration lasted longer than that of a shooting star or comet. As it made its approach over our heads heading west, it slowed a bit and the flare seem to pulsate somewhat.  It continued its path west and began to diminish in size and instantly disappeared into the western sky.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294

The ball of light had no blinking lights, which immediately raised a red flag in my mind.  It slowly flickered out and then disappeared behind the clouds.  Once it disappeared, another rose from the west and followed almost the exact same trajectory.  This one disappearing in a section of the clear sky.  I called my family outside to show them as one by one they came out of the west only to disappear.  This happened a total of seven times before it stopped;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
Round UFO may be related to flashing star-like ufo that reacted to laser pointer.;2017-02-19 11:00:00;<1 second;Round UFO may be related to flashing star-like ufo that reacted to laser pointer. I was looking up. I saw a star floating slowly by high in the sky.  Later, a shooting star in the same area. I will often times take a phone picture of the sky on an active night hoping to catch something random.  On this night I did. I did not see it at the time of snapping the phone. Later when I looked at the photo I saw the ball shaped object. Its the view from my driveway, so I know there are no street lights or any thing else with similar look.  The next night i was looking up and saw another star-like light.  But this one's light turned-off right as I focused in on it.  I shined my laser in its direction, the light came back on.  This went on over 20 times, back and forth with no regular pattern of on/off, of duration when light was on, even the brightness varied.  It was moving very slow, took 10-15 minutes to cross about 60 degrees of the overhead sky.  I see moving stars and on/off stars at least once per week, sometimes daily.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294

Orange/red spheres in a triangle and then moving over St. Petersburg, FL;2017-04-02 01:10:00;5-7 minutes;Orange/red spheres in a triangle and then moving over St. Petersburg, FL First two, then a third sphere of orange light appears and they slowly form a large triangle low in the sky.  They then fade out after about 2 minutes, and 3 spheres appear again.   They then begin moving NW to SE for a short distance.  A Fourth sphere appears in front of the three and after about 1-2 minutes the first 3 fall into a straight, equally spaced line.  They all slowly move and follow the first orb for a short distance, which then begins to move straight up at the same slow, steady speed.   The first then fades out in clear sky. The others follow exactly the same path and disappear up into the sky also.  It was a clear night with visibility 8+ miles.  There was no sound, no strobe lights or red/green or white navigation lights, just glowing orange balls, with red towards the rear.  They were quite bright and easily visible.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294

Shooting sphere.;2017-08-13 10:00:00;3 seconds;Shooting sphere Saw streak that quickly slowed down to reveal perfect sphere.  Slowing also changed colour from white orange streak to orange red sphere.  Thought it might drop from sky, but disappeared behind tree line.   Object was low and close and travelled at improbable trajectory (perfectly horizontal)  - 45 degrees off the ground and seemingly close mile or less away.  Object was clear, outline was crisp.   So in summary, thought I was seeing a horizontal shooting star that slowed down to reveal sphere - completely silent.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294

Thought it might be a star until it actually moved very fast a short distance.  Took my cell phone camera and zoomed in as much as possible, could see the flashing spinning red, green, blue, red and white lights.  Another person was with me and also took cell phone video.  Went back the next early a.m. and did not see it.  Will look again in the morning. ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??  PD));27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
White orb pulse at nanosonic speed.;2017-11-09 19:30:00;3 seconds;White orb pulse at nanosonic speed. I see these every few days because I watch the planes flying by as I sit outside.  This was a bright globe that appeared miles above the planes of which I saw 3 to 4 planes around 10 to 20k ft.  This globe appeared miles above them with a bright flash then like a whip shot across from west to east making no sound then disappeared.  The shear speed was faster than anything we could’ve produced.  No rockets no 3D image nothing could’ve replicated this speed.  White orb shooting as if a short pulse on its way through dimensions.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
