Transparent lens moving across the sky in St. Petersburg, FL;2013-04-02 21:05:00;30 seconds;Transparent lens moving across the sky in St. Petersburg, FL I was walking around outside of my house, talking on the phone, and I noticed 3 planes flying around.  The sky was pretty clear, and while paying attention to one particular plane to the east, I noticed a relatively large transparent spherical object moving slowly through the sky to the north west of the plane.  Thinking it was just something in my eye, I began to look away, and noticed it hadn't moved with my line of vision.  I proceeded to rub my eyes, look back, look away, and am thoroughly convinced it was not anything in my eye.  The stars behind the object appeared blurry, almost as if I was looking through a lens of some sort.  As the object proceeded, the stars that were behind it were perfectly clear.  This procession across the sky continued for about 30 seconds, before it disappeared from sight.  Turning my attention back to the planes in the area, I noticed that all three planes (while maintaining different headings) were all relatively equidista! nt from where the object had disappeared. I am a software architect by profession, with a background in physics and mathematics.  I have never experienced something quite like this, and just wanted to make sure it got documented in case anyone else saw it as well.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
Red orange orb had while glow around it moving east to west no sound moving fast.;2013-05-26 21:30:00;1:30;Red orange orb had while glow around it moving east to west no sound moving fast. Red orange orb with bright white around the outside moving fast.  Not on a regular flight path of the airports here.  No sound as it approached our area.  Smooth flight path but did change direction.  But not like a plane would.  Coming from the the Tampa Bay area moving towards the West in the Gulf of Mexico.   Once it got over our home it slowed and hovered a few seconds then moved west again.  There was no wind at the time and when it moved off.  It had a smooth like glide and then it just went off in the distance.  It seemed to me at least 5000 feet in the air.  Then it was gone into the sky.   There was another person that saw the same thing I did and we watched it for at least 1:30.  He is a Server and I am retired. I have grown up and lived near a major airport most of my life as well as him.  I have worked in Television News and I know what a plane sounds like.  I also notice the takeoffs and landing patterns of the airports and air bases in the area.  He is male and 41 yo.  I am male 5 yo.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
We saw 2 large UFOs 'docking' in the sky at a 30 degree angle for a long time.;2014-10-05 00:00:00;10+ minutes;We saw 2 large UFOs 'docking' in the sky at a 30 degree angle for a long time. Driving home through downtown St. Petersburg, Fl. Sunday night, we spotted an oval ship, UFO high in the sky NW of the area.  It most probably was over the Gulf of Mexico, near Maderia Beach or Treasure Island.   It just hung in the sky, about 10,000 feet or more up, was a beautiful pinkish color, slanted on a 30 degree angle.   After our car moved slowly up the street going west, we spotted another UFO near it.  Same way.  It was not exhaust, nor a cloud or a weather balloon.   Husband got it on video.  If it were closer to the ground, it would be quite large, perhaps 3-4 miles large, estimating.  They remained stationery and seemed like they were just docked there for the night.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
