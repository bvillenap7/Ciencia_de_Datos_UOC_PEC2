Large, dark, diamond-shaped object hovering;2008-09-28 21:00:00;10-15mins;Large, dark, diamond-shaped object hovering My parents described the following situation to me and wanted to know more, so I thought this would be a start. My parents were vacationing in St. Pete, Florida on Sept. 28th, 2008, and were driving on US-19 at around 9 P.M. when they noticed the clear outline of a large, dark, diamond-shaped object that seemed to be hovering three-fourths of a mile to the side of the roadway. The diamond-shaped outline could be observed as it blotted out the stars and all other light from behind it, and even more noticeable: a row of brightly-lit windows stretched down the length of the object. They described the object as large as a house, but probably even larger, due to its distance from them. My parents had slowed down considerably to observe the object, and they described the object as “hovering”, because not only did it appear to be totally motionless in relation to their speed, but it also appeared totally motionless in relation to other low-altitude planes and aircraft, which were moving normally even while the object receded behind them as they drove on. They also described the object as being well above the horizon and high in the sky, not apart of or constituting any kind of ground structure, such as a building or power lines. My parents actually turned around at the next available opportunity, some five or ten minutes later, and drove past the area where they had seen the object, but could not find any trace of it instead, they did observe three helicopters flying in unison and passing in the direction they had seen the object. Traffic was somewhat heavy at this time, and my parents were wondering if anyone else had observed this object and had reported in.  You can contact me via email, or via phone for further questions or to speak with my parents directly.  Thanks a lot.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
