I am ex-USAF. This was no conventional craft, triangular, darted in all directions.;2007-12-20 18:15:00;3:00 Hours;I am ex-USAF.  This was no conventional craft, triangular, darted in all directions. First, this was not a significant sighting as sightings go, though it was my first, but I'm submitting because my report may help corroborate reports of others.  We first spotted the craft at 18:15 EST.  It was dark here in Florida.  I noted the time because as soon as my wife said we have a UFO we checked the time.  The craft appeared WSW of my home and at a very high angle, almost overhead.  I would place the craft almost due west of Saint Petersburg proper.   There was heavy periodic cloud cover with some moonlight. The size of the craft to the naked eye appeared to be just larger than a star so it was very high.   However, we had low power binoculars, and night scope. When viewed through these two aids it was clear it was a triangle and had lights.  There's no doubt this was a craft as it was clearly intelligently guided.  It would dart to the right, left, back and forth at amazing speeds and do a strange wobbling motion in concentric circles.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294

Triangular, delta shaped craft with about 6 light.;2014-03-27 08:30:00;5 minutes;triangular, delta shaped craft with about 6 light I just know we were leaving the condo to go eat at crabby bills or crabby jacks. We were headed what i believe was north.  The beach woas on our right or east side.  We sat at the red light when my husband and his cousin noticed a space craft very low to the ground...maybe 10 stories high.  It hovered over homes or condos that wouldve been close to the beach. It sat moving motionless in the sky.  It did not move for 5 minutes. It had no moise comi.g from it.  It was large, triangular shaped i think.  It had lights 5 0r 6 in a triangle shape which is why i think it was a triangle shaped craft.  It was dark out, but lots of city lights enough to see and know it was not an airplane and not a helicopter.  Im a teA her, i know what those look like.  Mother use to work for delta so i know what planes look like. This wasnt a plane.  As we drove i tried to get a picture bbut couldnt act fast enough.  By the time we got to the restaurant, beside the ocean..ocean view, it was gone or we could no longer see it.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294

Triangle shaped objects that hover and move fast.;2016-04-28 23:45:00;4 minutes;Triangle shaped objects that hover and move fast. I was coming home from work on 62nd Ave and 275 overpass, when I noticed a triangular object hovering above some apartments.  I turned in the look at it as it was silent, I thought is was a helicopter but when I got near the parking lot it turned to the right and started to move slowly.  At which point, a second object that looked similar joined it and they started to move off towards the airport.   The sound that came out of them was like a very heavy rumble sound of rocket engines.  It had 5 to 6 bright white lights and no other color lights. One minute it was they were there then they were gone.   I was in the military and never seen anything like what I just saw.

I continued driving and soon caught up to the craft amazed how quick I caught up an airplane.  As I pasted it, I immediately could tell it was not a commercial airplane.  It was dark and more of a triangular shape with, I believe, five lights underneath.   The nose of the craft was facing south and it was just hovering over the trees off the right of the interstate near a neighborhood.  I could not tell if it made any noise due to my radio. I was left feeling shocked.  I thought maybe it could have been a military plane since I was about 50 minutes away from MacDill AFB.  But what raised questions is 1) being so close to the craft, why could not hear it over the radio, 2) what would the air force be doing flying so low through a residential area?   I was not able to pull over or turn around due to the fact I was on the interstate.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
