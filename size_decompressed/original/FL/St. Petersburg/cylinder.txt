Black high speed object, rod?;2013-08-08 16:00:00;1 second;Black high speed object, rod? I saw an interesting cloud, irrelevant to the sighting.  The cloud was interesting enough that me and a friend were looking at it and talking about it for 30.  My point is, I was studying the sky.  I decided to take a picture of the cloud.  I took two photos just i case one was blurry.  I looked at the pictures a day later and noticed something that I did not notice at the time of the photo.  It appears to be a fast moving black object.  I know that it was not a bird or a plane because I would have seen it in the time preceding and following the photos.   The clouds in the sky were completely dark except the one little tip that must have been high enough to catch the sun light.  It appears that this object is high enough to catch these sun rays also, but it remains black.   Of the two photos the object was captured in the first photo, second photo was taken about 10 seconds later.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
I looked up at the sky and saw what looked like one of those cigar shaped objects I have heard about.;2015-03-04 15:00:00;5 minutes;I was sitting in my backyard and looked up at the sky and saw what looked like one of those cigar shaped objects I have heard about except it was the color of the clouds  But it was moving slowly across the sky away from the clouds about the same speed or slower than a small plane.   It took a few minutes for it to move out of my eye sight.  I know I have never seen anything like it.  I know it was not a cloud.;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
Disappearing white cylinder over South Florida sky!;2015-05-25 11:00:00;2 minutes;Dissapearing White Cylinder over South Florida sky! I was riding back from Tampa to Ft. Myers (not sure the exact location) in the back seat of my friends car on the passenger side looking into the western sky I believe, when I spotted what I thought to be a plane.   I started to examine it more closely and realized it did not have wings or a rutter, looked like a white cylinder.  This seemed weird to me so I pointed it out to my friend (who was also sitting on the passenger side of his girlfriends’ vehicle, front seat.)  He says, “Yeah, I don’t know, it looks like a floating white cylinder.   Almost immediately after he said this, the object disappeared in front of our eyes, leaving us both in awe.  We then said at the same time, “That thing just disappeared, what the hell?”   Has anyone else seen any other cylinders or cigar shaped objects in the air over Tampa, St. Petersburg, Sarasota area?;27.7873969405429;-82.6844108139294
