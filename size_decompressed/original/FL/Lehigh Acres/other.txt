Strange Object or Meteorite and Unusual Aircraft Activity;2005-04-13 00:30:00;25 seconds;Strange Object or Meteorite and Unusual Aircraft Activity I was standing in my driveway when I looked up to see a airplane that did not appear to be on a normal flight path and did not sound like a standard airplane that flies in and out of any of the local airports.   Not thinking much of it at first, I spotted a dark orange, possibly red set of lights running almost perpendicular to the airplane.  It started out looking like a meteorite but then began to flash in a pulsing fashion as it moved to the north.  In the time that I observed it, it actually seemed to go out completely a few times allowing a non-illuminated object to be seen, barely visible but still there.  Finally it disappeared just as the plane that I was originally watching changed course in its direction. Both the plane and the object were unusual.  The plane because it did not follow the normal flight path of the commercial airliners that move in and out of the local internation airport and it appeared to be higher than normal for the distance that it was away from the airport.  The object itself would normally have been considered a standard large meteorite except for the fact that I've never seen one fall to the north in this area and I've never seen one glow and pulse like this.

Aliens on satilite T.V.?;2006-10-05 10:30:00;15 SECONDS;Aliens on satilite T.V.? This sighting was not in the air nor was it a ufo.  It was a sighting of aliens on my t.v..  my wife and myself seen it.  We have satilite t.v.. the t.v. went out and we got a snowy picture for about 15 seconds.  There were two Aliens that looked like they were working on something because they looked to have tools in thier hands.  Then we got back our regular t.v. show and it happened again.  The same two Aliens at a table with tools. It lasted about 10-15 seconds again.  But this time they looked up and it seemed like they knew they were on t.v. or something because the picture cut out fast.  I looked at every channel I have and there was nothing even close to what we seen. Is it posible that they are useing our own satilites to communicate?  It was very strange to say the lest. But we did see it. The Aliens looked just like they say.  Big heads, big eyes, small mouth, no ears that we could see.  They wore something that covered them like a doctors smock.  Please tell me if someone else has seen this too.  Thank you for your time.  This is not a joke.  This is true, so please let us know. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  We do not know whether this is intended as a serious report.  PD));26.6091991935484;-81.6728677419355
Green orb over lehigh;2007-12-18 00:30:00;10 seconds;Green orb over lehigh   My wife and I were on our way home wed. the 18th at about 12:30ish a.m. when something caught my eye in the sky.  I was about to tell my wife to look when she says do u see that?   It started as a tiny green orb stationary in the night sky and proceeded to get bigger and brighter and grew in intensity.  It took off like a rocket to the west with a super long super flurecent green trail behind the super flurecent green orb.  And as fast as it appeared it and it's trail disapeared.  The night sky was clear that night with the moon being crecent and bright.  This is the second time i've seen this.  The first time was about 20 years ago when i was a child on a vac trip to orlando going down S.R.31.;26.6091991935484;-81.6728677419355
5 objects in close formation, but in no particular order;2008-11-28 15:00:00;10 min;5 objects in close formation, but in no particular order November 28, 2008 approx 3pm  I was talking to a friend outside on the phone, and took notice of 5 objects high in the sky, north of where i was at.  The sky was perfectly clear, except for the very beginnings of a small wispy cloud. The objects were in no clear formation, but close together in the sky. (an area smaller than the palm of your hand, perhaps two inches square) They looked metallic to me, as they seemed to shimmer. They were about the size of a pencil (softly dulled) point at this time.  They looked to either be white, or red. There was one that was definitely red. While trying to keep track of them, it looked like something was swinging from below them, kinda back and forth. I thought maybe paratroopers, but i dont see how i would be able to see some one that small that high in the sky?  Two of the objects seemed to stay in the same spot. I was looking through wires going across my yard, and they stayed in that same position for approx a min. I got up to look for a better vantage point, trying to see if maybe moving to a different area if i could see them clearer  I lost track of two, couldn't see them any more. Three of them looked like they were in triangular formation, equal lateral. I watched two of them for a period of time, they remained close to each other and finally were too small for me to see in the bright sky.  I sat back down and caught sight of two of them again, just sitting there in the sky. I would say the total time of my watching them was approx 5-10 minutes.  Again, they drifted, till they were too small for me to see.  About 20 min later, I took notice of a silver tubular object that crossed the sky from west to east. I continued to watch this object watching for wings or something to show it was a plane. Again, nothing was visible. I looked away for a sec, and back up, and it was gone.  It had been above my house, and then it was gone. There was nothing blocking my view of the sky, and it wasnt that high up that i wouldn't have been able to see it anym! ore.  Th is item looked to be the size of a plane, silver. Clearly visible. I watched this item for about 10sec total. I am not sure what these items were. The first five is what really grabbed my attention, this second item was just odd.  I am 37, single mom with a college degree.  I have spotted odd things in the sky before and reported them. I am a believer in UFOs, but am still skeptical of them as until I see one that is beyond a shadow of doubt of alien origin, personally.  My son was also watching the 5 objects with me.;26.6091991935484;-81.6728677419355
