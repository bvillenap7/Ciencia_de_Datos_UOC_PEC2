Heard a plane takeoff and as usual they come over our home on the way to Atlanta.I watched the plane come over the house out my window and as it passed looking at tail section a white streak of light left the ground moving SW TO N.NE Object crossed in front of airliner which veered to the left as if startled .This object was moving at a tremendous speed and left a trail behind.This only took seconds.First believed to be a meteor but immediately realized that they dont come from ground And go up at a 45 degree angle .Was as if a missle had been shot at the aircraft, but no sound other than the jet.I heard no air to ground transmission over my scanner of the sighting.Aircraft was approx 1/2 mile from my home.Trail from object was long as comparison to the aircraft about 5 times the length.Never seen anything like this.I live approx 8 miles from the airport.Please do not use my name or email address, but you may contact me or email me.Iwonder if any one else saw this??..;26.6091991935484;-81.6728677419355
Large Blue Flash with radio outage.;2002-09-15 01:30:00;5 Seconds;Large Blue Flash with radio outage. I was in the north western part of Lehigh not far from where Gunnery merges with Buckingham Road.  I was in the car with my girlfriend when we both say a very large flash of blue light in the East-Northeastern part of the horizon.  The light appeared to be ground based and only lasted for about a second at full brightness.  The part that I find odd about this flash (to make me not think it was just someone with fireworks) is that at the exact moment the flash started, the radio in my car went out and stayed out until the flash had faded (about 5 seconds total from beginning of the flash to the return of the radio signal).;26.6091991935484;-81.6728677419355
