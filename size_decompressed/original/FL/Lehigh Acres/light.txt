We have amended the date here, assuming the witness entered the incorrect date.  PD));26.6091991935484;-81.6728677419355
saw odd lights outside my house at 4:00 in the morning.;2004-07-14 04:00:00;2 hours;saw odd lights outside my house at 4:00 in the morning. it was around 4:00 am and i was awoken from sleep.My room has a hurricane shutter down so i didnt see the light till i got into my tv romm so i dont know what woke me up.I went out to the tv romm wich is a room that has 3 glass walls.i was watching television and i noticed 5 lights  in a straight line there was one big light in the middle two medium lights and on the outside there where to smaller lights.All the lights where white except the right end light.The line was from left to right i thought it was a neighbors light but it was way to bright and it kept getting closer. after a half an hour it faded and went away then the lights turned back on then it made a 90 degree rotation and was facing up and down. at this point i ran in my room and put shoes on and ran outside.It was still getting closer and it was at least 7 times brighter than the moon.Then as soon as i could see a lighter blue one the horizon it started to go away and right before the sun came up it completley dissapered.;26.6091991935484;-81.6728677419355

3 UFO's sighted that look like stars in the sky. Impossible flight maneuvers...cloaking capabilities.;2011-08-06 05:00:00;4 - 8 minutes;3 UFO's sighted that look like stars in the sky.  Impossible flight maneuvers...cloaking capabilities. I was standing in my driveway around 5 a.m. I happened to look up into the sky and i saw what looked exactly like any of the other stars but it was moving. I kept watching it and thought maybe it was a satellite or something because it seemed to be on a pretty steady path.   But then it started angling downward....it continued on a downward path for about 20 seconds.  I became really confused about what it could be when it appeared to move sideways and then flickered once and I couldn't see it anymore.  So I just stood there for a while, and I saw another one. I ran inside and woke up my wife and said there was a UFO outside.  She got up quicly and we both ran outside to see it.  I spotted it right away when we got back outside and this is what happened......it continued moving across the sky much like the other one did and it also decended....but not like the other one....it decended at a rate that I don't think could be possible for anything.  On the human body..! .the negative G's would be intense at best.  I have never seen anything drop that fast and neither has my wife. It then literally disappeared before both of our eyes and we actually looked at each other at the sime time and said...It just disappeared!   My wife stayed outside with me for about 5 minutes while we continued to scan the sky....she went back inside to have a shower to get ready for work and I stayed out in the driveway.  That's when I saw another one. I ran back inside to get her but she said she couldn't come because she was in the shower.   I ran back outside and couldn't find it again.  After this happened...I did some UFO footage research.  What my wife and I saw is an exact match to what some people are posting.   I was skeptical before about UFO's but not any more....I know what I saw and nothing can do what we saw.;26.6091991935484;-81.6728677419355

Traveling Down Columbus Street in lehigh acres at 10:21pm.;2017-09-18 22:21:00;~2 minutes;Traveling Down Columbus Street in lehigh acres at 10:21pm. Notice three strobe like lights in sky,it seems to be a bit higher than the tree line, maybe a bit higher.  They seemed to go past us like a helicopter or something of the like.  Notice the light is still visible as if it slowed to our pace.  We decided to follow in our vehicle.  After following for about a minute, we stopped the truck and noticed it was still the same distance from us as a few moments before.  It seemed to stop as we stopped.  A car turned down the street and then it just vanished.  We have 2 videos one of which shows an orange light a second above our vehicle.  We had also observed a strange animal on the road a few minutes before this all happened.  Sort of like a monkey, it was on all fours, and stood up and ran on 2 legs. however there is a monkey farm not too far from that location.;26.6091991935484;-81.6728677419355
