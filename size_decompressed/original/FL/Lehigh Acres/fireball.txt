Over the course of a half hour, just after celebrating the new year, my family and I were shocked to see an orange fireball floating high above my neighborhood.  After viewing it for a short period of time (2 minutes or less), the orb flew off.  We thought this was weird, but possibly connected to the fireworks going on around us. We then were even more surprised when it appeared that there was another orange fireball-like orb floating in a similar spot.  Over the course of a half hour, we saw over 20 of these orbs slowly float above our street, speed up, and disappear into the sky.  The orbs were simply a ball of fire, and were extremely bright and high up in the sky.;26.6091991935484;-81.6728677419355
