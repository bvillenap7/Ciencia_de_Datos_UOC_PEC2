Watched what looked to be a cylinder shaped object, highly reflective, silver head westward across the sky, had an extremely long bright white tail stretching out behind it.. I would say about a foot length behind a pencil point or smaller sized object.  It flew very high and very fast.  It could possibly be a jet? Couldn't hear any noise, above the many birds in my yard.  The tail seemed to evaporate in a shimmer behind it. Not like a contrail that lingers.   Thought it could be the space shuttle, but after checking the website it wasn't due to take off till 2:45pm today.   Could be nothing more than a jet?  I would love to know one way or another.   Please contact me at my email address if it can be explained or otherwise. Thank you.;26.6091991935484;-81.6728677419355
