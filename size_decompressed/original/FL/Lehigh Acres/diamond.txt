Sighting of four redish orange diamond shaped objects in SW Florida sky heading North East;2013-03-16 23:00:00;10 minutes;Sighting of four redish orange diamond shaped objects in SW Florida sky heading North East I was walking through my front yard looked up at the western sky at the cresent moon and saw 3 strange lights traveling slowly east just below the moon.  As they climbed higher (I thought they could have been firework), they stopped then one by one disappeared.  After the first one disappeared I yelled to my husband to come look.  He came and was amazed too.  I had to make sure I was seeing this right.  He saw them, then a fourth showed up and one by one they stopped, slowly disappated, then disappeared until they were all gone.  I've never seen anything like this.  They were shaped like diamonds with four fire red colored corner dots.;26.6091991935484;-81.6728677419355
