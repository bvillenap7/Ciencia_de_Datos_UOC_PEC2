Question over what i saw.;2005-12-27 23:00:00;15 sec;Question over what i saw. I have a question pertaining to what i saw.  I saw a triangular (equilateral) craft.. White circle lights each corner, red and blue flashing lights on the rear edge (singular lights one of each) and i believe it was a flashing red (?) light towards the front(?) or maybe center(?)  Honestly dont remember.  I question if this was a known aircraft or if it was it possibly a  UFO? I dont want to be somone who each time they see lights in the sky they are crying UFO!!! I know there have been a lot of reports of triangular craft. I made a report of seeing a orb last month (Nov 26th?), so seeing this, this month has me skeptical.  Yes, i heard noise from it  Sounded like it could have been a normal craft, though it wasnt as loud as i would expect. But again, i do not pay a great deal of attention to planes etc in my area.It was Approx the size of my thumb nail, give or take. I am not sure what direction it was heading?  I would appreciate it if somone would contact me, and let me know if this could have been, or if it is just a regular airplane common to the US. I really dont want to be another crack pot enthusiast. I believe very seriouly in the UFO phenonema, just not sure  what the Govt has flying thru the skys, or where the aviation technology has led to.  I am sorry that I am not giving better info, i was mentally tearing apart what i was seeing in comparison to what others have reported.  I would appreciate further contact thru my email, and if necessary i can provide further info.  Thank you.;26.6091991935484;-81.6728677419355
