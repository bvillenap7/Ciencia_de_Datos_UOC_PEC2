UFO sightings 2 days in a row in Lehigh Acres, Florida.;2011-08-07 05:00:00;10 minutes;UFO sightings 2 days in a row in Lehigh Acres, Florida My wife and I have seen unidentified flying objects in the sky for the past 2 early mornings in a row....around 5 A.M. All I can say is they look like stars that move...they fly in irregular patterns and they are able to disappear into mid air.  The sky was clear except for a big cloud this morning. The cloud would flash about every 6 - 8 minutes.  After the cloud flashed once....we saw something flash about 2 miles away. We saw one of these star looking flying things fly right into the cloud that was flashing.  It's like...the flash looked like lightning in a cloud....but it didn't behave like lightning in a cloud.  The duration of the light flashes were identical rather than varied as you might expect in natural lightning flashes. Once again this morning,  I awoke my wife and she saw them too and in fact pointed out at least three of them.  We saw one go across the sky...stop...and then it went from 0 miles per hour to at least 2 or 3000 miles per hour instantly.  It left a streak behind it that disappeared instantly...meaning the streak did not hang in the sky....it sort of looked like what a fa! lling star looks like....but this was an object we were watching....it stopped and then took of at lightning speed....also...there was no trajectory as you might see with a falling star. It was completely parallel with the ground.  This morning we determined that they also fly at seemingly different heights, they can drop from high altitudes to low ones quicker than anything I have ever seen.  They have a hover type quality in the appearance of their flight. We saw one go directly into the cloud with the constant source light....it would flash about every 6 - 8 minutes.  Once again, it sort of had the colour of lightning...but each flash happened at roughly the same time distance apart and the flashes had the same duration.  There is no doubt that there are unknown flying objects above Lehigh Acres, Florida right now.  My wife and I have seen them 2 days in a row and nothing on earth can fly the way they can.  There are wierd flying stars in Lehigh Acres, Florida.   Come see for yourself at 5 a.m.;26.6091991935484;-81.6728677419355
Alien being seen running on foot on the ground.;2014-03-27 23:30:00;30 seconds;Alien being seen running on foot on the ground. I was outside smoking a cigarette, heard a noise over by our fire pit, I looked, it was really dark, saw something about 3 feet tall, no fur, longer nose/snout, on hind legs, with front legs hunched over like it was bent over, it stopped looked at me and ran like hell through the yard, between two houses, turned and ran down the street, it was quiet outside, I heard its feet, sounded like hooves on the pavement, this thing was fast, scared me to death, I went inside shaking and told my family.  My dogs went crazy barking, with fur standing on end, trying to get outside to chase it. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the mother of the source of the report, who assured us that she felt her son was reporting the incident honestly.  She reported that the witness was shaking badly, following the sighting of the event.  PD));26.6091991935484;-81.6728677419355
