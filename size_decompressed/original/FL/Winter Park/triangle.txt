My boyfriend and I saw an excessively bright yellow triangular craft pass by our bedroom window at a low altitude.  Approximately the size of a 747 with no navigation lights. There was a low hum as it went by and was too close and too low to be an airplane.  It disappeared past where we could see for about two minutes, then returned from the opposite side as though it had circled us.  It was much closer now and the light lit up part of our room.  It flashed a bright white light a couple times and we could see that there were three lights on the back of the craft and only one on the front.  We weren't sure where the flashing white light was coming from.  The low hum was there again and it was moving very slowly in a smooth path.  I traveled out of view again and did not return.  We did not see where it eventually went to but airplanes went by 15 minutes later and confirmed that the craft was both too low and too close to be one, as well as looking nothing like them.;28.5978278879829;-81.3069643329397
