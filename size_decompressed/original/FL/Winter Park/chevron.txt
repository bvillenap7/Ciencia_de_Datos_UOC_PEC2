I was at work,looking up at the sky,facing west.I noticed movement in the sky to my right and observed the following.There were 5 lights in a delta formation,the point of the delta started down,then came up as if performing a loop maneuver.The delta was maneuvering radically in this fashion,but seemingly in one small part of the sky.The lights were faint,giving the impression of being at high altitude.The lights were also moving very fast.At one point during a loop maneuver,the light at the bottom right of the delta,broke off and began maneuvering independently,while the main body continued to move.The 5th light at one point seemed to almost execute a figure 8.Then the 5th light rejoined the main body,the point of the delta came up and then disappeared allowing me to only see the lights at the bottom of the delta.The lights then faded out quickly,as if it were flying away from my view.I observed this in the northwest horizon at approx. the 10 O'clock position.The entire event lasted between 20 and 30 seconds.;28.5978278879829;-81.3069643329397
V-shape object blended so well with night sky.;2015-10-20 21:00:00;10 seconds;V-shape object blended so well with night sky. Was talking on the phone outside and looking up at the sky.  Saw a plane and then turned my eye towards the south and saw something floating fast, but gently moving south in a V formation with very dim oval disc like lights equal distance apart from each other.  It blended in rather seamlessly with the night sky almost stealth looking.  Very strange, made no noise as it floated above my apartment until I could not see it past the roof.  I live near the airport but this didn't have the standard blinking lights or anything.;28.5978278879829;-81.3069643329397
