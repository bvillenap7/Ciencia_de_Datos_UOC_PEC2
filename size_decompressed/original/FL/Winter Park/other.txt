2 Sets of 3 Amber Lights In Triangle Formation Over Winter Park, FL.;2014-02-14 19:00:00;10 minutes;2 Sets of 3 Amber Lights In Triangle Formation Over Winter Park, FL One set amber lights soaring up from a what seemed only a few hundred feet off the ground and bearing Eastbound from the West of Winter Park, Florida.  They were bright orange but seemd to dim to an amber color as they approached closer to us, no easily identifiable strobe lights or green or red lights were seen on them they flew quietly in a triangle formation at first but gradually broke that formation to fly in a straight diagonal line distancing themselves apart from each other significantly, all within the span of approximately 5 minutes until each one, one by one, faded away.   Within seconds of their vanishing another set of lights, three bright orange objects, very muck alike to the ones we had been watching appeared approximately from the same general direction the first set had traveled from.  Again, they soared from a few hundred feet off the ground and flew and triangle formation as well though this set did not break up to form a straight diagonal line.   They lingered in the sky for approximately 5 minutes as well.   Other aircraft were flying around over us, a planes and at least a couple of helicopters--those we could easily identify by their strobes, green and red lights, and other like characteristics.;28.5978278879829;-81.3069643329397
