Then, another light flashed right next to it and the were burning at the same time. The two lights were very close together. Then the right one would flash off and then the left one would flash and then the right would flash after.  The flashing alternated for 30 minutes sometimes seeing both and other times just seeing one of them. There was no pattern I could notice except when the two flashed together they seemed to get very bright. Towards the end of the 30 minutes, the right light looked kind of redish purple and the left light looked yellow-green. The flash kinda looked like a lightning flash because I saw a little trace of light streak. It was not a plane or star. I wantched it for 30 minutes doing this.;28.5978278879829;-81.3069643329397
