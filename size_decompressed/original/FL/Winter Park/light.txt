Irregularly pulsing red lights shooting across the sky, coming to a complete stop, then ascending upwards into the atmosphere.;2014-02-21 19:45:00;40 minute;irregularly pulsing red lights shooting across the sky, coming to a complete stop, then ascending upwards into the atmosphere. The witnesses included myself, a neighbor and his son.  My neighbor had already been witnessing the event for fifteen minutes when I joined them.  We observed several red lights, moving unusually fast from the Southeast direction at a diagonal towards the Northwest. For an estimated 40 minutes total, they kept coming, 60 seconds to 3 minutes apart, following the same diagonal trajectory initially in pairs, then one after another. Immediately, we noticed that this was not any aircraft, airplane or helicopter, as the red light was disembodied, and pulsing/ flickering irregularly (like a candle) as opposed to uniform regular flashing as with a helicopter.  The red lights also seemed to have a red halo.  They also seemed to be close enough (at helicopter height) that we should have been able to make out the body had it been a man-made aircraft. The movement was unusual: it would zoom from the horizon in a quick burst, then stop and remain stationary for a minute or two, before shooting straight up into the atmosphere and disappearing at an incredible speed.  Sometimes, after coming to a stop, they would slowly turn in meandering half circles, before shooting up. At one point, one of these red lights shot up close to passing airplane (we live close enough to the airport to see several passing planes at various heights) and we were able to observe that it began below the plane and shot up above it as it made its ascent at tremendous speed. I personally observed a total of 6, with my neighbor claiming to have witnessed 11 total.;28.5978278879829;-81.3069643329397
