Winter Park, Fl, 11 Red orbs seen in southern sky starting around 7:30pm for 40 mins.;2014-02-21 19:30:00;40 minutes;Winter Park, Fl 11 Red orbs seen in southern sky starting around 7:30pm for 40mins. Friday 02/21/2014 7:20pm. Winter Park, FL Size of the orbs were relative to a golf ball about 15ft away. The color was a solid bright mid-range red with slight halo. Total time of witness approximately 40 minutes total. I was sitting on my patio looking south over my neighbor’s apartment and noticed above the tree line 2 red orbs.  I thought it may be planets until they disappeared.  I walked east down the sidewalk to see if it was the clouds when I noticed the 2 orbs again are now in line with the community pool about 100ft west.  In turn, the objects now seemed further yet the solid intensity of the orbs were still full.   I ran and got my son out of the house and explained what I saw and were, we waited watching the area of interest.  Within a few minutes we saw from the southeast appear an orb and begin to move in a north west direction behind it was another following the same path.  They seemed to remain within a close distance and at the same point began to go in a westward direction.  They sort of slowed down almost to stop when a 3rd orb appeared from the exact same southeast location.  The 2 first orbs moved slightly westward and came to a stop then seemed to ascend directly out towards the atmosphere until they disappeared.  A few minutes later a neighbor was walking and asked what we were doing then saw for herself the orb appearing from the southeast.  We moved closer to the pool area to avoid street lights and watch as an additional 6 in total passed through the same path. I did try to find the weather direction for that time but the best I could do is:  &#61607	Point Forecast: Point Forecast: Winter Park FL 28.6°N 81.35°W (Elev. 92 ft) &#61607	Last Update: 8:55 pm EST Feb 21, 2014 &#61607	Forecast Valid: 10pm EST Feb 21, 2014-6pm EST Feb 28, 2014 Source: http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=Winter+Park&state=FL&site=MLB&textField1=28.5959&textField2=-81.3437&e=0#.UwgJeDiPKUk;28.5978278879829;-81.3069643329397
