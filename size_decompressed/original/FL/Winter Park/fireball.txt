Glowing light coming from between trees.;1976-07-15 10:00:00;20 minutes;A friend and I were walking to the back of Place 436 apts.which at that time were bordered by woods.  At about 10 pm we noticed a glowing light coming from between the trees so we started walking toward the edge of the woods for a closer look.  We assumed that the woods had caught fire again as they had the previous year, but then we saw a 30 to 40 ft dia fireball hover out of the trees and hang there just above the tree line.  It stay there for what seemed like 5 minutes, it was very bright, flames seemed to lap all around it like a burning tennis ball, then slowly decended back into the trees,it remained out of sight for at least 3-4 min then hovered back up again. It stayed there for another 5 min or so then slowly started rising until it looked like a star. We ran back to my apt to tell my sisters who were having a sleep over but no one beleived us. I was only 11 at the time but It's still just as vivid today. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that this may be a hoaxed report, but we are not certain.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));28.5978278879829;-81.3069643329397
Large green fireball seen through clouds falling diagonally for 3 seconds and terminating in a flash of white light.;1998-12-28 19:45:00;3 seconds;Large green fireball seen through clouds falling diagonally for 3 seconds and terminating in a flash of white light. I am not a trained observer, but I am an amature astronomer. I have seen many shooting stars, and this didn't look anything like a shooting star. This is the second green fireball I have seen falling. The last was in the first week of Nov. 98 and that sighting lasted for only a second. That fireball was clearly visible about 30 degrees above the horizon and large enough to see it's head and tail destinctively. Interestingly the tail flared out and was wider farther from the head of the fireball and much thiner near the head. However the last green fireball which I saw on the Dec. 28, 1998 could not be made out clearly because of a dark rainy sky. But I could see a large glowing green light falling in or just behind the clouds above and in front of me as I drove west on 50 outside of Orlando. The fireball *seemed* to have fallen well into the lower parts of the atmosphere when it terminated. Unfortuneatly I have no way of estimating how quickly it was moving or how far away it really was. It just seemed close. Compared to a shooting star it moved very slowly. And seemed to just be falling. After about 3 seconds it terminated with a brilliant flash which lit up the clouds in a white light. Though the fireball itself was green.;28.5978278879829;-81.3069643329397
A rising or nearing bright yellow glowing rectangle stopped to create a fireball shape, dropped glitter-like substance, and disappeared;2012-01-19 19:40:00;5 Min.;A rising or nearing bright yellow glowing rectangle stopped to create a fireball shape, dropped glitter-like substance, and disappeared Upon arriving at a local restaurant, me and three other friends got out of our car to see a bright yellow glowing rectangular shape either coming towards us or ascending.  This was to the north at a 65-degree angle.   This had captured the attention of around 15-20 people soliciting/socializing outside the restaurant.   After 10 seconds, it stopped and formed a very bright fireball.  It was about four times as big as the North Star, which was conveniently next to it.  It remained this shape and then began to periodically drop or shed a glitter-like substance from it.  After glowing profusely, it began to flicker and then disappear.  After it disappeared, it was not seen again.  The overall condition of the night was clear skies and low 60's.;28.5978278879829;-81.3069643329397
3 large bright orange/yellow fireball lights flying through nights' sky vanish.;2012-01-30 22:06:00;15-20 seconds;3 large bright orange/yellow fireball lights flying through nights' sky vanish. At approximately 22:05, a co-worker and myself noticed 3 very bright orange fireball shaped lights in the sky as we were leaving work. They were brighter and larger than any plane we had ever seen before. Suddenly after watching for a few seconds, the 3d light disappeared out of the sky. The remaining 2 large bright lights moved south across the sky together. They kept a distance between them, when suddenly the second (ufo) accelorated faster than I have ever seen a plane. It looked as if it were going to hit the first object, then stopped suddenly right underneath the first. The both paused for about 5 seconds, sitting still in the nights' sky. Then one become very bright, then very dim. The other followed the same pattern. Then they flickered their lights, and vanished completely!! We waited for minutes, but saw no return?;28.5978278879829;-81.3069643329397
Fireball ufo flies south to north and stops.;2012-12-16 22:30:00;5 to 10 minutes;fireball ufo flyes south to north and stops It was about 1030 at night and me and my fiancé drove to her parents house to drop off her sister, who is in town for xmas.  As we were leaving the house carrying stuff to the car we got about 25 feet away from the door and something caught my eye.  I looked up saying “what is that”  and me and ((woman's name deleted)), my fiancé, saw what looked like a fireball colored light in the sky.  I watched it and realized that there was no trail that something burning up in our atmosphere would have.  Just an orange and yellow light.  It took maybe two seconds to travel from the southern horizon to  right in front of us.   Once it was directly in front of us it was about 7x the size of a star as apposed to the 4x it was over the southern horizon.  It had a tilt resembling the tilt a helicopter would have flying forward but had no flashing lights and was not white green or red.  And almost look like the side of a saucer.   As I ran back to get her sister, which took about five seconds ((name deleted)) put the stuff by the car and walked out to the street to watch the light.   When I came back and stood with her in the street the light had moved it was now over the northern horizon and shrinking in size.  Total it took the light 10 to 20 seconds to go from horizon to horizon.  The object then began to brighten and disappear almost pulsating from nothing to a bright light for about 5 minutes and then stopped and nothing was to be seen.   Honestly I can say that not only was I excited to see a ufo, my first sighting in my life, but I had an uneasy feeling the whole time I was watching it almost like the feeling of a frightened cornered animal.;28.5978278879829;-81.3069643329397
