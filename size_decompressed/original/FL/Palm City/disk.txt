Orange disc flying past moon.;2014-04-02 20:55:00;3 minutes;Orange disc flying past moon. Tonight's sighting was of a different object than previously seen, this one was orange glowing disc shape with a dome on top just like you would picture a space ship from a movie.   It was flying ne ascending past the moon,  I saw a distinct shape and called my husband and my mother to come see by the time they got out to see it the shape was indeterminate but the orange glow was still flying. The fact that I keep seeing these things has me looking for them even more.  When will the government decide to admit that they exist and are here, my friends may think I'm nuts and ridicule me but I'm not afraid to admit that I have seen these ufo, and keep telling people to keep their eyes open at night because they are here and have a reason for being so numerous. I'm a 50 year old woman of sane mind believe it or not.;27.1605;-80.2925
