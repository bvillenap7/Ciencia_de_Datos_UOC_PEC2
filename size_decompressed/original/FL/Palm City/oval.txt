Orange glowing orb traveling over central Martin County, Florida.;2014-02-15 23:20:00;15 seconds;Orange glowing orb traveling over central Martin County, Florida. Observed orange fuzzy object flying from west to east at about 1500 feet.  There was no associated noise or any flashing indicator lights like I see on aircraft at night in the area.  Object was easily traveling at 500mpg or greater as I have been to many airshows and this was as fast as any fighter jet that I have seen.   Object didn't have any tail to indicate that it was a meteor and the ISS was over the Pacific at the time.   This was not Venus or any other celestial body.;27.1605;-80.2925
