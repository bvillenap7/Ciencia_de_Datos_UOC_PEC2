Rapid darting object over Cape Canaveral.  ((anonymous report));2018-04-06 03:30:00;20 minutes;Rapid darting object over Cape Canaveral I was talking with a friend on the phone, when I noticed red lights (a set of two) floating in the air north of us.  It appeared to be distance from us, around Cape Canaveral distance. The lights hovered, then quickly darted towards the east.  The object stopped abruptly, then moved back towards the West with small scallop like motion a couple of times.  It then stopped  again, and slowly lowered downward.  At my line of sight, it dropped below tree line briefly, then seconds later shot up high into the sky again, abruptly stopping, then moving westward at a rapid speed, to then stop again make a small loop, and then move eastward again at a rapid speed.  The movements were too fast and the stops to abrupt compared to a helicopter.  The blink of either green or blue lights were apparent at a couple of the the maneuvers.  The object dipped below the tree line again.  It came above the tree line once agin and darted at a skyward diagonal heading eastward, stopped, hovered, then headed west again at a rapid speed.  Eventually the object lowered straight down below tree line and out of sight.  During the encounter there was no sound, such as with helicopters or airplanes.

Star that wasn't a star.;2019-05-20 03:00:00;2 minutes;Star that wasn't a star. Every morning between 1:00 am and 4:00 AM I go outside in my back yard with my two Rat Terriers to let them water the lawn.  On this particular morning, I was looking up at the southern sky and noticed what I thought was a rather bright looking star, but as I stared at it, I realized that it was very slowly drifting to the south.  After observing it for about one to two minutes tops, the light just simply shut off and this drifting star went completely dark as if someone shut off a light switch.  The sky in my area was cloudless on that particular morning at approximately 3:00 am.  Not sure what it was, but I am sure that it wasn't swamp gas.;27.9895309062745;-80.6504959721146
