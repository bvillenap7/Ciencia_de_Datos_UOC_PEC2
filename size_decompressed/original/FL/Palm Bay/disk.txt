The Moon, Jupiter and a UFO in Florida’s night sky.;2019-05-21 05:30:00;10 minutes;The Moon, Jupiter and a UFO in Florida’s night sky. My dogs woke me at early this morning to go outside (barking).  I let them out and stood by the open door waiting for them sleepily.  I gazed up at the bright beautiful moon and noticed Jupiter lower and toward what would be my right,  but then (also lower and what would be my right) there was another bright object.  This object I wondered if was a planet surely would be big news of such an alignment.  So I watched the sky for a bit and noticed it blinking different colors and moving in strange ways.  Up and down (from my vantage point) and side to side and sometimes a little ways up then side ways, down then jumping back to original location.  Kind of all over the place within a (what seemed from my distance) to be a relatively small area.  It was very high up and close to Jupiter.  I did not feel fear, but wonderment.   I grabbed my cheap little cell phone to try capturing it on video (mostly to probe to myself I wasn’t imaging things.   It was a long vid o! f me trying to focus mostly but I did indeed capture it for a few seconds.  On a side note:  I know the tall whites exist (not saying they have anything to do with this sighting), BUT I have seen one.  I saw it shift from it’s original tall lanky graceful body (walking) to a teenage girl (walking with another teenage girl).  The feeling I got was that this being was there to assist her in some way.  It projected a peaceful and caring spirit (if you will).  This happened about four years ago in San Diego, CA.   Now I know for sure UFOs exist.;27.9895309062745;-80.6504959721146
