Cigar shaped object and numerous small globe objects.;2009-04-24 00:12:00;continuing;Cigar shaped object and numerous small globe objects A large object in the eastern sky is hovering and swaying back and forth in the night sky.  Meanwhile numerous very bright white globes are flying up to it or near it and then they fall back.  It's like a cat and mouse game.  I am going to go back outside ... 15 minutes later, this activity is continuing.  Back here writing it is now 12:50 AM and it is still going on.   All this time I have been watching this battle or interaction with these lights.  For awhile there were two large cigar shaped objects in the sky with all this dogfight action from tiny white globe objects or ships.  Sometimes the white globes seem to emanate out and spiral from the cigar shaped objects.  This sighting may last for hours.  I am reporting this here but I am not reporting this to local police or anyone.;27.9895309062745;-80.6504959721146
