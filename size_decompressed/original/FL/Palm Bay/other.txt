Bright Orange Light Slowly Flying Over Palm Bay Florida;2013-05-24 20:45:00;5-10 minutes;Bright Orange Light Slowly Flying Over Palm Bay Florida last night about 8:26 There was a Delta rocket launch from KSC in northern Brevard county. KSCis anout 40 miles to the north of us.   About 35 minutes after the launch, my daughter called to tell me she and two friends were watching a orange fire ball slowly flying to the east of them heading south.  She was about 4 miles north of us at the time.   My husband and I went out and watched the sky about 1 minute later we saw an orange ball of light, it looked fairly large from where we stood coming toward us from the east, heading west.  It was completely silent and I did notice a tiny white light in the back of it.  The object slowly started heading south and eventually disappeared.   My husband the  ever the sceptic even mentioned how odd the thing was.  I have seen plenty of fire balls here and they usually speed through the sky. .this kind of took it time.;27.9895309062745;-80.6504959721146
