Sonic boom, followed by zoom sounds.;2017-10-04 22:43:00;30 seconds;Sonic Boom folllwed by zoom sounds A weird noise that shook the house like a distant sonic boom and then three zoom noises that you normally never hear, like something you would hear In a space movie almost like laser sounding and the sky got bright for a slight moment like 10 seconds.   Then, a few minutes later, a few helicopters flew after it.  My dog also has been crying nonstop before and after it and looking at doors like someone is coming, but I donâ€™t see anyone or anything.;27.9895309062745;-80.6504959721146
