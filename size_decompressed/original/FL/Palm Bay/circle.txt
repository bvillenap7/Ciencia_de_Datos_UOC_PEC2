At first thought shooting star, until it took off across sky and stopped on other side of horizon and hovered.;2020-05-24 00:45:00;1-2 minutes;At first thought shooting star, until it took off across sky and stopped on other side of horizon and hovered. This is going to sound so weird, and perhaps I should not say this here, but, here goes...  We just saw a UFO. This is NOT the first time we have seen something odd at night and this time, it was obvious. How does one go about reporting sightings? I googled and was sent to an astronomy club (via Nasa website). I thought this thing, at first, was a falling star, until it hovered for a moment and then sped off across our night sky and then hovered again on the other side of my horizon.  NO, it was not a satellite, it was too low. NO, it was not a plane, I know what they look like and NO, it was not a shooting star. This thing went from one part of my horizon to another in less than 4 seconds.. It was fast, but, hovered and it showed up out of the blue. That's why I originally thought of a falling star.  What we saw was NOT normally something you see in the sky. This is the 2nd time Carrie and I have witnessed something odd in the sky. The first time was in Hawaii (2018 and that was 3 stationary objects that flashed)... at first we thought that was morse code and that was about 1-2 AM Hawaii time on July 25?  I have to check that date if someone would like to verify with me.  I  did not know there was a place to report, otherwise we would have reported sooner.;27.9895309062745;-80.6504959721146
