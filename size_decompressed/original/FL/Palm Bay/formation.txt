Lights over Brevard County.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly advertising lights??  PD));2017-10-05 21:40:00;10 minutes;Lights over Brevard County Driving north on turnpike, notice multiple bright white lights in the sky, east of the turnpike, fairly low.  With cell towers and planes in sight as well, I noticed something odd.  There were about 3-4 steady, bright white lights and they seemed to be moving around each other in some formation. There were no other indicator lights and they also seemed to be hovering steadily in the same vicinity around each other. I watched this through the tree line for close to 10 minutes, maybe less.   Stopped at a rest stop and once we started again, they were gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly advertising lights??  PD));27.9895309062745;-80.6504959721146
2 three light objects hovering.  ((anonymous report));2018-11-08 21:00:00;20 minutes;2 three light objects hovering. From north to South above Rt 1.  Two crafts barely moving, three lights across.  Craft above 1/2 mile apart.  Same path.  Went directly over our car about the height of a small plane would fly.  We saw what looked like a military plane or small plane with typical flashing blue and red light come up next to the leading UFO.  Circled around the area then left.

A formation of 50 star like lights moving off the coast of Melbourne;2019-03-14 21:00:00;10 minutes;A formation of  50 star like lights moving off the coast of Melbourne From Palm Bay looking ESE  Over the ocean (perhaps 50 miles out) at 20* up I saw what appeared to be a heavy concentration of stars.  They were all the same size similar to stars of a blue and white color.  The stars pattern was that of a rhombus.  The heaviest concentration were centralized creating a single glow.   WhenIi grabbed my binoculars and viewed the formation they were all blue and white star objects.  At the center was a perfect chandelier pattern with loosely scattered stars to the left and right sides of the chandelier within the overall rhombus.  I was shocked to see the brightest central area of the rhombus was a heavy grouping of the lights in a perfect chandelier shape.  As the minutes passed the formation of outter loose lights were moving into the central chandelier or the entire object was rotating making the outter lights appear to be moving inward.  The formation gradually grew dimmer and more dim as it appeared to be moving out further in an ESE direction until it was no longer visible.  2 others in the area were also watching this occur. My initial explanation before the binoculars was re-entering glowing hot space debri.  My second thought sometime of explosion in the air.  A 3rd would be a massive amount of aircraft chaff glittering, glowing and hovering in the air.  With the binoculars the only logical explanation I can come up with is drones flying in a formation shape out to sea. Nothing else I can think of makes sense. There has to be other people that saw this from the beach, it was huge bigger and brighter in size than the Pleiades or 7 sisters constellation.  The sky had no clouds and half moon.;27.9895309062745;-80.6504959721146
