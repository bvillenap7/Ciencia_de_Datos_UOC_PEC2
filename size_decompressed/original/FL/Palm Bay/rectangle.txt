Object seen hovering above bed.;2001-07-21 03:00:00;4mins;Object seen hovering above bed. My wife and I were in bed sleeping, I came to out of a dead sleep feeling like something or someone was watching me. as I looked around the room I didn't see anything until I looked up and over to the right of the bed. At first I thought I was dreaming or seeing things. As I started to get up to get a better look all I could do was move my head I could not move my body in any way. as I looked and saw that I was not dreaming it stopped and paused for only a few seconds and changed colors from a solid to more of a transparent silver gray color and slowly left the room and went through the wall. once it was gone I felt that i could move my legs and arms.but at the time of this I felt at peace and in no harm. My wife was laying on her back and I was on my side with my arm over her body. my wife is in her 7th month of pregnancy. I feel that this thing was not here to harm us in any way but here to scan us or maybe just my wife. I think that at the time I woke up it had just finished what it was here to do, or that it was getting ready to start and I disturbed it in some way. The shape of it was rectangler about 3inches thick by 2feet in length with a small dome like eye on the bottom of it's belly. It was rounded but yet squared at the corners.;27.9895309062745;-80.6504959721146

Looked like this * * * Three horizontal lights orange/yellow in color.  Stationery east of SE Palm Bay.   About 5 minutes later an addition single light joined it.   Tried to get a picture with my phone, but I was driving, so didn't get a good one.  Tried to drive closer to the location, but trees were blocking my view.   Once I got past the trees, it was gone.   I am a 58 yr old mother of 4.;27.9895309062745;-80.6504959721146
