Many orange orbs fly overhead and out to the ocean.;2012-03-03 21:50:00;5 minutes;many orange orbs fly overhead and out to the ocean. 21:50 Friday Feb 3, 2012- Driving north on  HWY US1  I saw 8 or 9  yellow/orange orbs in the night sky.  At first I thought they were sodium /low intensity lights, like street lights.  But I noticed they were moving across the sky. I looked to my left and saw many more coming.  They were silently moving from east to west very smoothly.  The werenâ€™t in any type of formation- a few here, one here, another couple here and so on.  They flew over head at approximately 1500-ft ( just a guess)  traveling at  maybe 100mph.  They were slow enough I could find them in my cameras view finder and track them. They flew over the Indian river and then out to sea.  They were strung out in a trail that took maybe 4-5 minutes to all pass by. There were 3 or 4 people across the street that saw this too. I have small video clips, they show color and shape but dont come close to representing the experience.;27.9895309062745;-80.6504959721146
