Holograhic cigar shape appears headed east toward coast and then dissapears in an instant.;2009-07-25 10:15:00;5 sec;Holograhic cigar shape appears headed east toward coast and then dissapears in an instant. My daughter and I were driving southbound toward Palm Bay,Florida.  We both had our eyes caught by an object in the sky.  It was between the shape of a twisted envelope and a cigar and caught our attention because it was sparkling like diamonds, or a silver holograph,  then it just disappeared, and we both looked at each other and said “What the h*** was that?”  It was too high in the sky to go below the horizon, and the sun was too high in the sky and at the wrong angle for it to be the sun reflecting off of it.  The object was moving east toward the coast.  Maybe lasted 5-10 seconds.  We were joking afterwards that some one had just gotten in trouble for  hitting the uncloaking button,  because it appeared and then disappeared so quickly.  We are aged 24 and 49.  We’ve watched aircraft take off and land, space launches,  meteor showers,  and other phenomena but never seen anything like this before.

The sighting was brief because it disappeared behind some trees.  Told my wife to turn around, but it was too late. Object was quite large, bright yellow on top and bright red on  the bottom. Distance from me was about 1/2 mile. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));27.9895309062745;-80.6504959721146

Large, bright orange fireball in Palm Bay, FL.;2016-05-05 21:00:00;2 minutes;Large, bright orange fireball in Palm Bay, FL. Bright orange fireball.  Oval  shape.  Appeared to be traveling SW.  Traveled slowly through the sky.  It looked quite large compared to any aircraft or bright stars.   There wasn't a long tail on it.  There was no visible trail on the dark sky.   At one point it turned to the east and got smaller, as it traveled away.   Too many trees blocked my vision to the east.;27.9895309062745;-80.6504959721146
