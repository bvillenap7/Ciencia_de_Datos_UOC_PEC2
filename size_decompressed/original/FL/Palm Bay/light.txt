I was on my way home from work at approx. 9:45pm. I was talking with my co worker over the phone.  Just as I was crossing the top of the I-95 overpass on Palm Bay Rd., I looked over and saw two green lights in perfect alignment with each other, motionless in the sky over a section of woods off to the east of I-95.  The objects did not appear to be moving and were about 200-300 feet off the ground.  I immediatly asked my co worker if she was seeing the same thing.  She replied with a no.  I then turned down Hollywood Blvd, where the object was,  It then quickly darted over I-95 and then stopped over the highway and then again slowly began to move west.  At this point my co worker who was still on the phone with me now began to see one of the green lights above Emerson Drive, which is west of I-95 and 3 miles west of where I was. The other green light was not in sight for about 1 minute and then my co worker began to see the second light as well.   I lost sight of the object and then my worker said the object was out of her sight as well after about 2 minutes.;27.9895309062745;-80.6504959721146
There were two slow flashing lights, red in color. They were north of my location, strobing in sync with each other.;2015-07-04 21:35:00;90 seconds;There were two slow flashing lights, red in color.  They were north of my location, strobing in sync with each other.  Although they seemed to be separate objects.   I believed they may be helicopters in the distance.  Until I saw a third and finally fourth come into view.  Seemingly from nowhere.  All four objects hovered in formation, and seemed to be slowly moving from west to east in the sky.  The initial two lights flashes began to dull out gradually with each flash until just never reoccuring.  The fourth light stopped flashing abruptly, and the third light had worked it's way to where the first two lights disappeared.  The third light remained there for about 20 sec.  Until slowly dimming away as well.  I thought at first these may have been helicopters but the glow of the lights was different than that of a helicopter and the pulse and intensity was something I had not seen before.;27.9895309062745;-80.6504959721146

15 plus lights traveling in perfect straight line. Appeared as bright as a star.;2020-04-30 21:00:00;5 minutes;15 plus lights traveling in perfect straight line. Appeared as bright as a star. I originally looked toward the southwest sky to observe the Moon.  I then saw a string of lights moving West to East.  The lights were only as bright as a medium star, no blinking. The lights were in a perfect straight line one behind the other, approximately 15 to 20 of them.  There may have been more prior to my noticing them.  When the light would get to left of my center they would faid out of sight.  From my distance they appear to be an inch apart but I'm sure they were miles apart.  The very last light had another light slightly behind and out of line with all the others.;27.9895309062745;-80.6504959721146
