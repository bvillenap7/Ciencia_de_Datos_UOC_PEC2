Four gold fireballs moving across the sky in a line over Highlands County, FL;2007-01-22 20:30:00;4 secs;Four gold fireballs moving across the sky in a line over Highlands County, FL I saw 4 gold fireballs go straight across the sky.  Not upwards like a firework would be.  It was one fireball, then a little further over, another, then another further over and then the last one.  There was a slight trail between each fireball.  It all disappeared after that. I was just laying on the couch and for some reason I saw a light through the doorwall and I think that's what made me sit up and look outside.;27.4802063063063;-81.4482207207207
Line of fireballs in sky over Sebring, Florida (central florida) 9 PM EST 8/7/12;2012-08-07 21:07:00;45-90 seconds;line of fireballs in sky over Sebring, Florida (central florida) 9 PM EST 8/7/12 Walking the dog tonight around downtown Sebring, Florida area.  Looked up and saw a line of seven fireballs in a perfect row, all flames (not sure the distance from the ground but definitely high enough to be on the level of air traffic) glowing at similar heights and looked suspended and in a parallel line.  The furthest flame went out and then each subsequent flame went out one by one.  A new perfectly formed line of six or seven flames appeared and then went out in the same way as before, this time what appeared to be a plane (blue-green twinkling light) flew from the direction of the fireballs/flames.  Not sure what to make of it, I was amazed and in awe and was sad that no one else on the street was around to see it too.  I hope someone else in Sebring saw it tonight, it was beautiful!  Nonetheless, I will be doing further investigation as two of my initial thoughts were : Kennedy Space Center's Rockets and the current impending Meteor showers.;27.4802063063063;-81.4482207207207
