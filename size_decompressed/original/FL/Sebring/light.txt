2 yellow stationary lights floating above Lake Jackson in Sebring, FL multiply in diagonal formations.;2000-02-07 19:35:00;30 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  We have received a number of reports of yellow nocturnal lights in this area of Florida.  We presume that they are flares, or some type of ordnance, used at the Avon Park Firing Range.  We are uncertain, however.)) 2 yellow stationary lights floating above Lake Jackson in Sebring, FL multiply in diagonal formations. Driving northbound on US 27, my husband and I saw a bright yellow light glowing above Lake Jackson. Suddenly another light appeared next to it and one of the lights began to fade. Seeing that no tower or plane sound could be seen or heard. We stopped and parked to study the lights. The lights were between 5-10 thousand feet above lake surface, on a clear night sky. One of the lights faded and suddenly reappeared and multiplied into 5 separate lights in a diagonal formation. The second light did the thing minutes later, upward and then downward diagonal formations. Both lights dimmed and reappeared at different points above the lake. We saw a small streak of light shoot out of one of the glowing lights to the ground. We took pictures but they did not come out. A helicopter passed by the lake while the lights were stationary and must have seen them.;27.4802063063063;-81.4482207207207
Light hangs mid-air then dashes across entire horizon before dissapearing;2005-12-14 00:00:00;Under a minute;Light hangs mid-air then dashes across entire horizon before dissapearing Was working on a concrete pool, when I spotted a amber light far east. It was not moving at first, just hanging in the sky. After staring at it for about 30 seconds it started moving erracticly (not a straight line) then shot across the entire sky in about 5 seconds. The moon was not visible that night. And there were very few clouds. Besides the object, it was a black dark night sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
