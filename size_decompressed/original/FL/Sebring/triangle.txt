Red and White Lights Over Sebring;2019-12-09 21:00:00;40 minutes;Red and White Lights Over Sebring I am a licensed pilot, of over 50 years, and the 2nd witness had a lot of experience in aviation matters. We noticed a triangular shape in the sky on the Westerly side of US 27 in Sebring. There appeared normal aircraft flying higher than the UFO. I would have stimated the altitude of the UFO to be no more than 2,000 foot or lower. The UFO was too low to be a bright star and stationary for over an hour, so could not have been an aircraft, helicopteror or drone. The brightness of the lights, precluded being a balloon tethered inflatable, as a lot of power would be needed to give off the brightness of these three lights that were in close proximity together. After an hour clouds began to cover the lights, which indicates that the object was in the lower atmosphere. There was no noise, it was absolutely stationary in one position for over an hour in time. It was too dark to take a phooto, If anyone else saw this please indicate so.;27.4802063063063;-81.4482207207207
