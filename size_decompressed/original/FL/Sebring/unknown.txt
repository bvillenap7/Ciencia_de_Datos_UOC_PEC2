Moving light in night sky, not airplane or sattelite for sure;2014-12-13 06:40:00;4;Moving light in night sky, not airplane or sattelite for sure I looked up at the stars because they were supposed to be a meteor shower tonight.  I saw two stars moving apart.  One was a star the other was not as I looked at it I thought it was just an airplane, but then as I was watching it I thought differently.  It started moving erratic speeding up, slowing down, moving to the left then moving to the right but heading in the same direction, north.  Was very far away, so I couldn't tell the shape.  The color of the light was white very similar to a star,  It was below the trees after about three minutes. I know what I saw and it was not an airplane or a satellite.;27.4802063063063;-81.4482207207207
