Huge Glowing Orange Triangle turned into 5 Bright White Dots connected by lighter White lines seen by my husband and I in Sebring, Flor;2016-05-06 01:00:00;5 minutes;Huge Glowing Orange Triangle turned into 5 Bright White Dots connected by lighter White lines seen by my husband and I in Sebring, Flor On May 6, 2016, at approximately 1:00 AM, my husband and I were sitting at a table in our driveway.  I stood up to look around at all of the beautiful stars on this clear night.  My husband was sitting facing the Northeastern sky.  As I was looking around at all of the beautiful stars I looked to the Northeast and there it was!  My husband and I saw it at the same time.  It was a huge glowing orange triangle object coming up over the tree line. We both said, “What is that!” I took off to get my phone 15 ft. away and I heard my husband say, “It disappeared.”  I said, “It figures when I want to take a picture.”  Then all of a sudden it reappeared but it had changed its shape and color.  Now it looked like a giant star that I see in the sky every night but it was moving slowly.  It was now white and appeared to have 5 bright white dots connected with lighter white lines.  I followed it for about 30 seconds as it moved slowly across the sky.  Then it hovered in the distance for another 30 seconds as I shined my phone light towards it and then it disappeared.  Very strange indeed.;27.4802063063063;-81.4482207207207
