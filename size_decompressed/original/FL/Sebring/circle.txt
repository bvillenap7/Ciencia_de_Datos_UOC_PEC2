Bright white light appeared in clear blue sky for about 30 seconds around 9 A.M.;2004-12-27 09:05:00;30 seconds;Bright white light appeared in clear blue sky for about 30 seconds around 9 A.M. I was driving my car in the parking lot at Sebring Square, leaving McDonald's restaurant. I saw a bright white light in the southern sky at about 40-45 degrees above the horizon. The sky was not cloudy. The light looked as if the sun's light was being reflected off a metal object. Had it been night time, I would have thought it was the planet Venus, because that's what it looked like. I only saw it for about 30 seconds. About 3-4 minutes later, I parked the car in the Fairmount Cinema Square parking lot, got out of the car and looked for the object. I could not see anything in the sky.;27.4802063063063;-81.4482207207207
