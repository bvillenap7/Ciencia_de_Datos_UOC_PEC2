There were 2 smaller saucer shaped craft hovering silently on shore guarding it.   When we would try to take pictures, it would back into the bushes and turn down its lights.   The saucer craft kept an eye on us even flying across the lake to check on us if we got to loud and then return to position.;29.0396404795492;-81.2941899153764
