I saw a blood red light in the sky moving to the north west.;2001-02-16 20:50:00;10 minutes;I saw a blood red light in the sky moving to the north west. I have had some trouble with some raccoon's killing my hens. I went out with a hand gun hoping to shoot one when I saw what looked like a blood red star in the north west. I went back in the house to get my rifle because it has a very good 20 X scope. I had my wife come out to see it.  In the scope at full power it still looked like a blood red star. I watched it for a few min and it took on a slight greenish color at the top but stayed mostly blood red. It moved side to side just a bit and got smaller. I was left with the impression that it was moving away to the north west. It reminded me of the way the space shuttle looks when they have a night launch and it is moving away and all you can see is the engine burning as it fades away in the distance. My wife thought it looked like a kite moving side to side. I told her that it could not be a kite because there is no wind.  We watched it till it got so small it was getting hard to see it. My wife is in the insurance business and I do some precious metal investing. We have lived here for about 16 years. My e-mail is the best way to contact me.;29.0396404795492;-81.2941899153764
there was A-line of lights moving a cross the sky. They were moving North to South.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-30 21:20:00;5 minutes;I went outside look straight up in the sky and there was A-line of lights moving a cross the sky.  They were moving North to South In a straight line they would appear About a quarter off the horizon North and disappeared about a quarter off the horizon South.  Some were only a single light but some had a light next to it just behind it trailing.  They were also solid lights no flashing lights seen.  I have a friend that lives about a 100 miles away from me and he went outside and looked up in the sky and saw the same thing.  I couldn't get any video because it was too dark but I do have 4 pictures.;29.0396404795492;-81.2941899153764
