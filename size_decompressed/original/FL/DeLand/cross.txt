I noticed an intense orange circular glow up in the Northern sky.  It was brighter than a star or planet.  I said, ((male name deleted)), look at that intense beautiful light.   The light seemed to dim a bit and start to move in our direction.  Then it veered toward the South East.  As it cruised along, the lights began to change.  The once solid light now looked like the lights on a plane or multiple lights.  The color was still orange but dimmer and smaller.  I almost thought it could be a drone.  I didn’t hear any noise from engines.   We watched as it flew away and disappeared into the distance.  What I neglected to say was that as I observed it I was shooting pictures on my cell phone camera.  I couldn’t really see the UFO through my lens so I just pointed into its direction and took my best shot.   I was astonished when I looked at the pictures I had captured.  It wasn’t at all what I thought I would see.  One craft or meteor or space junk or satellite or UFO whatever it is was appeared almost rock like with sharp rectangular shapes that crossed like wings.  The other object was an oval or almost skeletal in shape.   Another shot of a similar bright white rock with glowing orange shading was similar in shape to a VW bug.  They were flying in tandem.  You can also see the moon in some of my pictures.  To me it has the appearance of an old satellite but I can’t explain the meteor.  Please let me know your thoughts.   Thank you, ((female name deleted));29.0396404795492;-81.2941899153764
