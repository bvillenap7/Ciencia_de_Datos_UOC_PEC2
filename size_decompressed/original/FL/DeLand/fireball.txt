9 rockets out of North Florida?;2021-06-02 20:30:00;1 hr;9 rockets out of North Florida? Was working the evening shift at our water treatment plant when i looked out the window and saw two orange lights traveling from east to west out of the north, ascending slightly. No strobes, sound or exhaust trail were observed. Just an orange flame similar to a rockets exhaust. Too fast given the distance, even for a fighter jet. As the first of the two started to fade, a third was observed ascending from the horizon at the north following the same trajectory. About 1.5 minutes elapsed from the initial sighting to the third sighting. When the third faded another two appeared ascending from the horizon maybe a minute after the first three. Lost track of time soon after, though i have time stamps on the videos. A few moments three more were observed over the course of what felt like  eight or so minites as each one took a good 1 to 1.5 minutes of flight before they faded completely. Five or so uneventful minutes went by and my coworker and i thought it was over. We then went inside. Approx 15 min later saw a ninth at the late state of the previous 8s point of travel. They appeared to be flying out of Jacksonville. But am confused by the westward travel. Away from the ocean over populated areas. The Altoona bombing range was too far south and to the west to have been a factor. There were airliners in the area but probably too far from the sightings.;29.0396404795492;-81.2941899153764
