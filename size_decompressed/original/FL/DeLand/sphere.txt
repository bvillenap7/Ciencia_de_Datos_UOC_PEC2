My best guess is November 7th, 2018. It was early in the evening, but dark due to the previously mentioned time change.  I'm again, guessing but I think it was probably about 1930 hrs. I left my house to take my dog for his evening walk and as I turned westbound onto my street, I saw what I thought looked like a Chinese lantern.  I watched it briefly until it disappeared behind a canopy of oak trees which lined the street.  Moments later, I saw it reappear from behind the trees and a few seconds later a second one, then a third one. I would describe these lights as spheres with an orange/yellow color.  The three looked identical and moved laterally or parallel to the ground not appearing to gain or lose altitude.  I now realize that the first light I saw was the last one to disappear behind the trees just before they all reappeared.  They were all equidistant to each other, and if an imaginary line were drawn connecting them, the end result would be a triangle.  I don't know if these were three separate spheres, or if they were three lights on a single larger possibly triangular shaped conveyance.   The spheres were last seen moving toward the west of my location towards the town of DeLeon Springs, Florida. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
