We went outside to see the neighbors' fireworks only to notice a strange orange ball/orb slowly move over our home and my wife, daughter and myself proceeded to watch the object move at a decent pace over the trees, then crossed the road until out of sight.   We thought nothing of it til we saw another take the same path, there was no wind or breeze.  Then another object popped up and took a similar path again.  By the sixth object we realize something crazy was going on, then the seventh one all with 2-3 minutes apart.  The eighth and final object acted different, instead of just moving along as the others did, at first sight it quickly popped up above the trees and stayed idle for a good 10-15 seconds, before cruising a little quicker along the same path as the others.
