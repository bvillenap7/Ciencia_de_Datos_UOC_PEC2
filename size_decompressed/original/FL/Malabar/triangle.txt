Boomerang shaped with stroblights rotating 3 or 4 city blocks large At nightfall I pulled out a new powerful spotlight to try out. My wife was present at the time.The night sky was cloudy with low foggy clouds.We were in a large clearing mayby 100yds.from pine trees. My light lit up those canapes vere well so i decided to try it on the clouds.  After flashing it in all directions for about 5 minuntes I put it down.within 10sec. I saw what first appeared to be a formation of hillocopters comming out of the northwest at approxmately 15mph. Then I noticed the strobe lights were not opperating seperatly but rotating around a very large Boomerang shaped wing.It appeared to be just above the tree tops, It was huge apx.3 or4 city blocks.The lights rotated apx. 20 times as It drifted above us and passed toward the southwest. it seemed someone was answering my light signals. I was frosen in amazement and was trying to absorb everything that was happing. Then as Quick as it appeared it disappeared into the clouds. Then another strange event happened  my wife had dissapeared also, now That I will tell you scarred me. I looked for her for apx. 5 min. before I found her.She said she had hidden from me but it was out of charecter for her and why or how could she ignore what was happing.  She is fine.
