Orange reddish orbs in the Orlando/Windermere area.;2014-08-05 04:00:00;1 minute;Orange reddish orbs in the Orlando/Windermere area. Pulling into my neighborhood on my way home from work.  Saw a giant orange, reddish orb in the sky towards the northwest.  It appeared to be traveling towards me.   I immediately pulled over to the side of the road and got out.  Watched it for the next minute as it grew larger, then suddenly seemed to change direction.   The orb elongated into a narrow strip of light (as though it were speeding away and leaving a trail) and within a few seconds it was a pinpoint very high in the sky, and then I could no longer see it.   Very exciting and curious to witness!;28.4985999999999;-81.5352999999997
