Large, very Low, very slow flying triangular object with a light a each point.;2013-11-20 18:25:00;30 seconds;Large, very Low, very slow flying triangular object with a light a each point. Driving southwest at approx. 6:25pm, I noticed two lights 300 feet or so above the tree line.  I watched them for several seconds trying to figure out what it was I was seeing.   I then pointed them out to my husband and he had no idea.  We continued to drive and then noticed the third light, as we were catching up to it. It was dark in color, dull, trianglular with a light at each point. Flying very low and very slow.  We were driving about 15mph. I poked my head out of the window to see more clearly and did so, also noticing that the craft made no sound.  It was quite large. Sun was down, and it was cloudy/overcast. At first we thought it was a plane flying under the clouds until we realized it wasn't moving much at all and then saw the third light, outlining the shape.  All we can say it was very strange.   This morning I looked up to see what Orange County drones looked like, still trying to figure out what is was.  No comparison.;28.4985999999999;-81.5352999999997
