Fast ball of light.;2016-01-01 23:00:00;3-4 seconds;Fast ball of light. While going on a night walk with my friend I noticed something from the corner of my eye, as I turned to look at it I noticed it was hovering next to one of the apartment buildings in my neighborhood. It was hovering next to the second floor window, on the side of the building, and as I looked at it directly it immediately moved to the right, now at what is essentially the 3 floor level but only further away. Then it moved again back to the left and was now hovering near the gutter on the roof of the building before making a curve like motion back behind the rooftop and out of sight, maneuvering in a matter of 3-4 seconds before disappearing entirely. Each time the object moved with such speed it would appear as a blur when moving. It zigged and zagged at incredible speeds, it would move, come to a full stop suddenly. Now when I say suddenly I mean unlike anything I've seem before. My friend who comes from Haiti said that he has indeed seen these objects bef! ore, and it was his belief that it was a spirit or something supernatural. I come from ohio, born and raised in the USA and I don't believe it was a spirit or ghost, simply because of how it maneuvered and stopped. The object was blue, spherical in shape and about 2-3 feet in diameter. The 'ball' was very bright like a small star, however I noticed that not the building next to it, or the tree, or the grass below was illuminated what so ever by this object despite it being very bright when looked at directly.;28.4985999999999;-81.5352999999997
