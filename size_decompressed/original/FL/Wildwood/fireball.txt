Stationary silent orange glowing object that faded away to look like a star in less than 2 minutes.;2014-08-05 04:00:00;<2 minutes;Stationary silent orange glowing object that faded away to look like a star in less than 2 minutes. 40 years of part time sky watching stars space station meteor shower had never seen  a UFO.   Taking garbage out around 4 am I notice a bright orange light to the low east where Venus has been appearing about 6 am. seems stationary I try and rationalize well is there a utility light in that direction no there isn't.   All of the sudden it is fading and in less than 2 minutes it looks like a fading star.  I have watched the space station take 6 minutes across the sky and end up trailing off like a star.  Guess there is a first time for everything.  In going to your sight I see others have seen familiar sights.   Silent bright orange no idea how far away it was.;28.8446000000002;-82.0375999999998
