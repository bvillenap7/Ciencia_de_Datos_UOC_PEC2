Green, oval shaped, flash of light, no sound;2008-01-25 23:00:00;2 sec;Green, oval shaped, flash of light, no sound At 11pm last night, while talking to girlfriend on my cell, i looked up behind the treeline behind the sleep inn, off of interstate 301, i saw a flash of green light, in the shape of an oval, dart across the sky at, what appeared to about a 70 degree downward angle.  I called it in to the local police because i thought something crashed, i never heard a thing, and i honestly thought we were being bombed or something.  I have never been more afraid in my entire life.;28.8446000000002;-82.0375999999998
