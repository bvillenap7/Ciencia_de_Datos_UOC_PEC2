Recordied for 3 minutes. On June 4, 2019, at 5:00AM, a few degrees left of due North, I saw a bright flash at about 45 degrees elevation.  At first it looked like an Iridium flare, but it was followed 4 seconds later by a brighter, possibly -4 flash only a few degrees to the right and at the 2:30 position of the first flash.  The flash period for both objects was 14 seconds. Both objects moved slowly on a West to East track and changed position relative to each other slightly between flashes.  Also during this time the brightness of the right hand object went from just a bit brighter than the ISS to brighter than Venus, but in a Mylar gold color. I was able to record three minutes worth of video with my Apple 6s.;27.9297;-80.5226
