I filed a report on this sighting earlier.  I had reported that the object resembled a very large Mylar solar sail.  Since then, I had time to review my 3 minutes of video with some software that allows me to slow down the frame rate.  I am filing an image Iâ€™ve been able to copy from a screenshot that shows a monochrome cube shaped object in a large checked pattern.  I observed this object for 3 minutes as it appeared to rotate and flash extremely brightly randomly.  The period between flashes were as short as 3 seconds and as long as 20 seconds.  I counted sixteen flashes with two periods repeating themselves 4.11 seconds, 14.82 seconds.;27.9297;-80.5226
