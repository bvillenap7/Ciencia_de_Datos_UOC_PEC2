Mysterious Lights Over Gulf;2007-08-20 21:45:00;est. 10 minutes;Mysterious Lights Over Gulf Saw several sets of usually colored lights in a perfect row.  They looked about the same as Mars does on a clear night, but much larger.  They would disappear and reappear in the same place over the course of 10 minutes.  I tried to video, but one camera malfunctioned, and when I went to get another, they were gone.  We alerted neighbors, but the appearances stopped. I was raised on AF bases and later joined myself, and have never witnessed anything like this.  Very very strange.
