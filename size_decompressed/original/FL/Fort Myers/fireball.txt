They were at the same altitude and were moving at a high rate of speed together. The spheres of bright light were traveling parallel to the ground at approx. 30 degrees above the horizen. At 55 seconds one of the spheres seemed to disintegrate into a puff of mist. 5 seconds later the second one disintegrated as well in the same manner.

Bright fireball seen over Naples area of SW Florida.;2010-01-11 01:40:00;15 seconds;Bright fireball seen over Naples area of SW Florida. Very bright light seen traveling from East to West from Southwest Florida International Airport, in the south (Naples area). The leading edge was very large and bright with a tail extending from the back. From the size of the object I don't believe it would have been possible for it not to hit somewhere (It couldn't have burned up completely.).;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
A fireball that looked like a bird that faded out.;2012-12-10 20:00:00;3:00;A fireball that looked like a bird that faded out.  I noticed this red fireball thing in the sky moving very slowly.  I ran inside to go get my little brother and mother.  Together we watched it disappear out of no where.  We have no explanation for this incident.  It looked like a bird on fire.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
8-10 fireballs floating through the air in a strange formation moving North.;2012-12-28 23:00:00;2 minutes;8-10 fireballs floating through the air in a strange formation moving North. I was pulling into the Wal-Mart parking lot off of 6 Mile Cypress and to the west I noticed a group of orange orb/fireball looking spheres floating silently through the sky moving North.   There was about 8-10 (didn't think to count them.  They were in a sort of constellation like formation.   Over about two minutes they started to disappear until I couldn't see any of them anymore.   This was witnessed by my mother and sister as well.   I tried to have my mother take a picture with her phone but the parking lot lights were too bright for the phone to capture what we were seeing in the sky.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198

On the form I chose fireball as my description but it was more like orange lights almost looked like stars or meteors.  But definitely not meteors because they were not falling down but moving across the sky slowly and completely quietly.   They were also flying in V-formation and the 5 or 6 lights were definitely all fkying together in a timing sequence. I thought I was video recording with my cellphone but never hit record button. I asked a guard at the gated community where I was about it and he said another guard witnessed it too but I never spoke to the other witness.  The 5 or 6 irange lights eventually flew out off in the distance out of my sight in thuer V-shape formation. I hope otgers in my area witnessed this too and reoirt it cuz I jniw what I saw was strange and definitely not airplanes unless it was mikitary secret technoligy cuz they were complete silenth my cellphone buta! pparently due to my anxiousness Ineverhitrecird but;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198

It's like they were watching the fire work they remain about 45 minutes, appearing and disappearing. ((December 31 2012, 15 orange and white lights did appear on my front home crossing  above my Lake, they were closer so i took pictures.)) This time they balls of fire were highest. I really would love to have an answer for that. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date above, to reflect a sighting on the night of July 4th.  PD));26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
