This disk made no noise and traveled east to west along palmbeach blvd.  We were on oritz when we first  saw it moving  about forty feet  high very slowly, me and my uncle rode a bicycle to tice st.  And could see it moving toward   down town over the residential houses.  Looking down the side streets where there was better lighting from businesses.  we could tell it was a saucer.  At the end of tice we turned on newyork st. to glennwood av. and continued seeing the lights rotate one at time in a circler pattern. Right before we approached the road the McDonalds is on a tree blocked my sight ,then it just disappear from sight. I've never ! seen anything like it. again.  Growingup in 70's, I never would have imagined there would be shows and websites to make a report of this incident.  This really happen and I hope other people who live in e. Ft. Myers in 1974 will remember seeing this disk shaped craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
A silver disk with a bulge on one face, maybe 30 feet across, reflected sunlight and bobbed around at 3-5000 feet.;2004-01-04 14:30:00;1 minute;((NUFORC Note:  We regard the person who submitted this report to be exceptionally capable, and we suspect he is an excellent observer and reporter of fact.  He has served as an expert witness in courts of law, and he has an exceptionally strong technical background.  We believe this report is quite reliable in the information it presents.  PD)) A silver disk with a bulge on one face, maybe 30 feet across, reflected sunlight and bobbed around at 3-5000 feet. We saw an airborne silvery disk-shaped object, maybe about 30 feet across, highly reflective, at about several thousand feet in the sky (just below some clouds in a clear blue sky, 80 degrees F., easterly breeze, I believe)  It appeared almost the size of the full moon to our relative view.  It was very clear, razor sharp in our view.  When it turned sideways it was very thin, and as it turned, it's bottom surface appeared shaded, and it's highly reflective upper surface showed a wide, low bulge nearly filling the diameter.  It was definitely a disk, and definitely nearly flat on it's upper and lower surfaces.  It was seen above McGregor and Summerlin Avenues, Fort Myers Florida, at about 2:30 PM, and we watched it for about a minute.  It behaved like a balloon, drifting and turning, climbing and dipping, bobbing weightlessly, in a more or less easterly direction, for several hundred feet problably, and did not appear to be under control or doing anything.  It was big.  It was absolutely a disk.  Our view of it was very clear, and it was definitely hardware, not a cloud, etc.  It was not a round weather balloon or a party balloon.  I was not alone. I did not notice any other motorists watching it, and traffic moved on, and we lost our view of it.  Nearby air fields are: Paige Field, and SW Florida International Airport. This occurred in or near the landing path for some of the air traffic. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness on approximately six occasions, and we consider him to be an exceptionally well-qualified witness.  He is a trained observer, and has served as an expert witness in courts of law.  He has made an attempt to locate other witnesses to the event, but has not been successful, to date.  PD)) UPGRADE TO PRIOR FORT MYERS FLORIDA REPORT - Peter D., Please see e-mail of today The object appeared to be of rigid construction, and did not flex or otherwise deform as it gyrated through pitch, roll, yaw, etc..  There was no visible weather balloon radiosonde package or parachute attached. It did not rise up to a higher altitude or disappear from sight.  A subsequent lightly conducted search of internet sites selling professional weather balloons, and large advertising balloons (national and international) and other possibly related items, found nothing similar, so far.  Actually, it appeared during this lightly conducted search that weather balloons might not even come in hard silver, or at least I have not yet found any.  Weather balloons Do come with telemetry packages and parachutes which are strund below the balloon on longish cable. This object has none visible.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198

Silver Disk Sighting   Near Fot Myers Florida Airport.;2008-01-26 14:50:00;40 seconds;Silver Disk Sighting   Near Fot Myers Florida Airport. On 26 January 2008 at approximately 14:45 PM I was on my pool deck when I looked to the north and saw a silvery object.  I thought it was a plane at first going west to east.  Then it changed direction and started coming toward me in a southerly direction.  I did not see any banking as plane or jet would do.  This surprised me.  I watched as it approached to see if it might be a helicopter.  As it approached, I could see that it was taking on a disk shape with  a bubble on top.  I do not know what distance I was from it as I had no  reference point for size other than trees.  There were no clouds near it although it was a partially  cloudy day.  I started to go in and get my wife but as I was watching it vanished.  Just winked out.  I am sorry I could not get a camera or video of the object.
