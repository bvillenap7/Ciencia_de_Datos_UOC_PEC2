white ball of light overhead....;1997-06-15 22:00:00;5 seconds;white ball of light overhead.... I've never seen a UFO and still not sure if I have...but thought I'd report only thing that might qualify. I was taking a walk at night... as I frequently do... it was a clear night..warm...and I noticed a ball of light...best way i can describe it.. it was like a bright volleyball of white light....it seemed only about 200 feet or so above...not high up like a plane....and it didn't seem large...like anyone could be inside it. it was right above me for about 3-4 seconds...and then it just took off...going west over the gulf of Mexico.  But what shocked me was the speed !!!  it was like those movies with warp speed....  it was completely gone within a split second !!  I've never seen anything like it..... and I haven't seen anything since that one time. The ball of light was also soundless...completely quiet.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
High altitude silver object visable 15 min hoovering slow sw trajectery early eve.;2006-05-03 18:35:00;15 min;High altitude silver object visable 15 min hoovering slow sw trajectery early eve. The object was a silver ball that appeared to be of metalic substance as it reflected the sunlight as an aircraft would. The object first appeared as a faint star-like object over our condo's clubhouse in the east. It was very high altitude as I had jet aircraft as well as the moon in the sky at the same time to use as a guage as to its height. I estimate the object to have been at ten to fifteen miles high. I had to strain to keep the object in my field of vision as I was in the swimming pool and I normally wear glasses. I observed the object approxmately fifteen minutes and during this time of observation the ufo moved only very perceptbly about a 45 degree trijectory from due east, from where it appeared,to south southwest when I was no longer to perceive it with the naked eye at about 18:50 hours. I had originally thought it could be a satelite of some sort but it didn't have a satelite or a weather balloons flight charcteristics at all. The observer served in the U.S.Navy and the U.S.Coast Guard as a radarman and have had much experience observing all types of aircraft as well as weather balloons it was not either. I feel it was a fairly large contact to have stayed visable for the length of time it did at that height. Two other people nearby asked what I saw But did not come to see what I was looking at. IN my opinion it was a definite unknown. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he seemed to us to be quite credible, and quite sincere.  We suspect he is an excellent witness.  PD));26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
Metalic object of sphereical shape exactly like the object I reported on 4/3/06 in the east 18:30 estimated 60 to 100,000 feet    60deg;2006-05-06 18:00:00;15 min;Metalic object of sphereical shape exactly like the object I reported on 4/3/06 in the east 18:30 estimated 60 to 100,000 feet    60deg The object I saw early this evening at 18:00 was a metalic ball exatctly like the object I had reported on 4/3/06 about one hour earlier. Visablity was clear to about twenty miles and the object was about 60 degrees on the horizion at an estimated altitude of sixty to one hundred  thousand feet. It was in the southeast and drifted slowly easterly when I was no longer able to track it. It appeared to be of metalic structure as it reflected the sunlight like an aircraft but had what I perceived to be a dark shadow to it when it was closest to me at between five and seven miles away. I was out to dinner with my wife in a viewing position about five miles north of where I had reported the object seen on wensday eve. I had went out to the car for something an I looked up and there it was. I exccitedly went back in for my wife and tried desperately to point it out to her but It was already fading away to the east and she was not able to view it. As a side note I almost feel like it knew I'd be looking for it again I don't know if this is common in these situations are not.  There were jet aircraft in the area during the sighting all of which were in the approach or departure pattern to the southwest Florida international airport.

large red shere in Fort Myers, Florida;2006-05-10 04:47:00;one minute;large red shere in Fort Myers, Florida I was walking to work and I looked to the horizon and saw what I thought was the sun or the moon but it had a reddish color to it.  As I rounded a bend, the object seemed to drift left.  When I got around the bend the object was gone.  I am 43 years old and I do believe in ufos but I have never seen one.  Is there any way for the moon to be reflected in the sky?  It couldn't have been the actual moon because it disappeared.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
Orange fireball flying slow at low altitude over Fort Myers, Florida, on New Year's Eve.;2012-12-31 21:10:00;3 minutes;Orange fireball flying slow at low altitude over Fort Myers, Florida, on New Year's Eve. I was headed south on Cleveland Ave. (US 41).  I had just turned left onto Cleveland Ave. off of South Road when I saw a bright ball of orange light flying towards me.    It appeared to be at about 500 feet and moving at about the speed of a small aircraft in the approach pattern, that is about 120 MPH.   The threshold of Runway 05 at Page Field is just a hundred yards or so northeast of the intersection of South Road and Cleveland Ave.  My first thought was that this object was a small plane on fire trying to make the runway, although its current position and direction of travel would have made Runway 31 a better choice for an emergency landing, especially since there was no wind.      As I watched this orange light, I realized that it was not an aircraft.  There were no navigation lights, no landing light, and no anti-collision strobe.  It made absolutely no sound.  It was certainly close enough that I should have been able to discern wings, fuselage, and tai! l, had there been any, but it seemed to have no physical structure to it.   It was simply a ball of orange fire.   I could see variations in intensity on its surface and small flames shooting out from it in all directions, and at times I thought I could see some white smoke trailing from it, but very little.  It did not leave a trail.  The fireball was moving in a straight line, from southeast to northwest, and holding altitude.  I turned right off of Cleveland Ave and into a darkened parking lot on Maple Drive and got out of my car for a better look.    This part of town is well lit by orange street lights and single story buildings, but this is a commercial area and almost every store was closed.   There are no high structures in this part of town because of the airport.  There were no pedestrians around, but there was still considerable vehicle traffic on Cleveland Ave.  The weather was clear and warm, and there were no clouds.   I still had a good view of the fireball as it! passed overhead just a little to the south of my position and! continu ed flying to the northwest, making no changes in altitude, speed or direction of travel.  When I first saw it over Cleveland Ave., it appeared to be about the size of the full moon in the sky, but the moon had not yet come up.   There were no aircraft nearby, and so I had nothing to compare it to for an accurate estimate of its size.   It continued on its course, getting steadily smaller as it became more distant from me.  I watched it until it became nothing more than a pinpoint of bright orange light in the distance.  I estimate that it did not fade from my view until it was well past the Caloosahatchee River and over North Fort Myers, or perhaps even out over the Gulf of Mexico.   I do not know if anyone else saw it or not.   Page Field is a very active general aviation airport, lighted all night, with a control tower.  I don’t know if the Page Field control tower is manned all night, but if it is the air traffic controller must have also seen this fireball.    Also, the control tower at Southwest Florida International Airport should have seen it as it passed a short distance south of their Runway 06, but given the FAA attitude towards reporting any unidentified airborne anomalies, I doubt that anyone in either tower would have said anything.   Given the heavy use of fireworks by the local population in this area to celebrate holidays, it could have been mistaken for an aerial fireworks display, if someone were to take only a quick glance and not watch it for a while.   I am a pilot, and can with certainty state that it was definitely not a firework, nor was it a flare, balloon, meteor, comet or any type of known manmade aircraft with which I am familiar.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
7-12 red lights moving in the sky;2015-08-15 21:16:00;5 minutes;7-12 red lights moving in the sky Received a call from my daughter who went to the mailbox and saw in the western sky over Cape Coral, Florida, a series of 7-12 red pulsating spheres that had movement to them.  Some hovered and some moved in various directions.   I ran downstairs and saw them on my own along with my wife and two neighbors.  We were all left amazed and confused as to what they were.   After about 2-4 minutes they began fading away, getting smaller, and disappearing.  I tied taking a picture from my iPhone but due to light pollution it was washed out in the image.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
UFO sighting during eclipse.;2017-08-21 17:45:00;3 mins;UFO sighting during eclipse. My kids and I were watching the eclipse.  Taking photos and looking through proper glasses.  We made a joke about a ufo that kept showing up in the sky.  Moved fast from side to side and up and down.   I took about 35 pictures and the object we saw is in each photo it also is in many different spots.  The photos themselves were taken from the same area.  Facing the same direction.  Meanwhile, my 4 dogs where barking and howling much differently then they normally would;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198

At first, I thought that is a very slow moving plane (airport near to the East), but then it stopped moving and had a slight dip or wobble reflecting sun off a rim.  I thought, helicopter, ultralight or balloon?  But it stopped and was motionless.  I pulled my phone out to zoom and take a photo but the object disappeared?  I searched the clear blue sky but couldn't  find it.   About 20 minutes later, there was a high flying jet contrails above this location.  I wished I was faster to get a photo.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
8 spheres lights moving south west Florida.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-30 21:14:00;5 minutes;8 spheres lights moving south west Florida My husband’s mother called us to go out side.  She had witnessed it first.  We went out front looking North West we saw about 8 light spheres all lined up in a row.  We live right by southwest Florida international airport.  These were not planes. They did not blink and weren’t traveling where planes usually do.  As they moved the first one disappeared.  Then as everyone got to the same spot they also disappeared.  They were moving fairly slow south east.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
