Curly que white con trail with sideways V grey trail in front. Very high and fast silver craft.;2009-08-17 06:40:00;5 minutes;Curly que white con trail with sideways V grey trail in front. Very high and fast silver craft. Not a normal con trail. Almost looked like pluse tech. Straight con trail then a loop or curl like a pigs tail. Eastern sky. Several loops spread out. Heard nothing, sun was just coming up and highlighted white trail. White con trail ended and then sort of a grey sideways V shaped trail and in front of that a spec of silver which was the craft. The craft was either very high or very small. The morning sky was very clear and the sun was just coming up and reflected off the bottom of whatever it was, then it just disappeared. Could of been one of ours. I have only seen that type of con trail in UFO stories.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198

Yellowish/orange objects seen over Ft. Myers;2012-04-04 20:16:00;2 minutes;Yellowish/orange objects seen over Ft. Myers We were driving down the street of the condo development we are renting in and noticed two unidentifiable lights in the sky and stopped our car.  They got closer and closer.  There was no sound.  When they were farther away they had a kind of elongated shape, were close together and moved very slowly.  As they moved on, they got further apart and we went from seeing them then instantly they were gone.  Did not see a trace of them disappearing, they were just gone.  There were 3 people on bicycles that stopped and commented “what was that?” Backgrounds of 2 observers, one 65 years old, retired from the DOT Sign Shop and one 65 year old retired from HospiceCare.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
Bright Green Flash of Light over SW Florida July 14th, 2013 at 11:30PM.;2013-07-14 23:40:00;5 seconds;Bright Green Flash of Light over SW Florida July 14th, 2013 at 11:30PM    Did anyone see a giant bright green flash of light over SW Florida last night, July 14th, 2013 around 11:30PM?   My Wife and I were driving Southbound on I-75 and to the SSW the entire sky all of a sudden light up the entire Southern Hemisphere with a giant green blast of light that lasted for about five seconds.  Aside from a man I saw once with artificial legs and real feet, it was the freakiest thing I'd ever see!  It was not lightening, it was not a meteor, there was no sound or sonic boom, just a huge pulse of greenish blue light that turned night into day for as far as our eyes could see for about five  seconds. UFO exploding in our atmosphere?   Dark Lightening?  Terrestrial Gamma Ray Flashes?  Remember the movie Men in Black where they flashed that green light in peoples eyes to make them forget what they just saw?  Maybe HAARP made a larger version?  Say Cheese  :-) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
