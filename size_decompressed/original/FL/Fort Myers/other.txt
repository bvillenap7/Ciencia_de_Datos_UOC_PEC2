Large bright U shaped (horseshoe/double tongue fork) looking object falling from the sky.;2014-02-05 17:55:00;5 minutes;Large bright U shaped (horseshoe/double tongue fork) looking object falling from the sky I saw something very bright and white.  At first I thought it was an airplane leaving fuel trail reflecting the sun but it was much larger than any plane I had seen before and much brighter.  Usually a plane will leave a lasting fuel trail but the tails streaming stayed very close to the head of the object.  I thought it might be a meteor.  I watched it go down behind the buildings until I could not see it any longer.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
My daughter and I saw a non regular color and shaped object in the sky that went at an angle not known then dropped them dp;2018-01-01 01:00:00;15 seconds;My daughter and I saw a non regular color and shaped object in the sky that went at an angle not known then dropped them dp My daughter and I saw a Christmas ornament shaped object that was gold/bronze color.  When I asked her to get my phone to record it, I saw it change from a round so to speak object to an upside down bell shape.   We marveled over the fact that it looked completely different in color than what we normally see in the air.  My daughter has been so scared that she is still saying it was just a fire work after 45 minutes.  She has stopped shaking, but yet is scared to death.  Wondering if it is going to attack us.  She states she saw it go up in the sky then drop and disappear.  I saw the same thing.   Neither of us wanted to call 911 because we did not want to make a huge commotion about this as she is, so freaked out this is the only way I can express what happened.  Even now as I ask her what she saw she is still stating it was a firework.  Which we both know was not the case.  It took place at zip code 33908.  Call me at 317-((# deleted)).  Name is ((first name deleted)).  I have left messages elsewhere in the mufon community.  Thank you.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
Fast moving light seen in early morning sky of Fort myers, Florida.;2021-04-26 06:21:00;~2 minutes;Fast moving light seen in early morning sky of Fort myers, Florida. Morning of April 26, 2021, ~06:21-06:23  We were watching the setting moon of fantastic colour, reported to be the first super moon of the year. From this westernly direction we had been looking in, a fast moving light appeared.  We don't know the elevation or exact speed. It resembled closely what a satellite might look like if it was more relatively fixed in position.  It moved in an easternly direction, towards the the sun that had yet to rise.  At fist we thought it a plane, but it could not be any commercial or recreational aircraft judging by how fast it appeared to move. We did not hear or feel the sound barrier breaking. We considered the object possibly to be of military or Space X origin, but we, cannot say for certain.  The object soon disappeared within a minute or two. We were unprepared to do calculations of any sort.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
