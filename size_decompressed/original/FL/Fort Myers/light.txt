3 lights with a very large flame trail traveling west to east;1998-12-15 23:30:00;5 seconds;3 lights with a very large flame trail traveling west to east We first saw the object to the south of us traveling from west to east. At first we thought it was over twards the airport but a later call from a friend in Naples stated it was south of him. It had at least 3 light balls inside what looked like a flame envelope with a flame tail. It to me had the look of a space craft entering the atmosphere. total time it was in visual range was 5-8 seconds. All witnesses are profesional security officers, including the owner.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
A non-blinking light passing the moon...then just gone.;2000-03-09 19:15:00;less than one minute;A non-blinking light passing the moon...then just gone. At 7:15pm on 3/9/00, went out to walk doggie and look for the Jupiter, Saturn, Mars planet configuration.  When I looked up at the moon to get my bearings, I saw a tiny dot of light moving from my right to left ... at arms length the dot was about an inch from the moon...if a straight line was drawn to the left and touching the lowest part of the moon.  The light seemed to move the same as the curvature of the moon around the bottom.  When the light curved in an up direction..from my perspective... it just disappeared.  There was no flashing, no colors, just a steady movement.  From the time I spotted the light until it was gone took five seconds..counting one thousand one, one thousand two etc.  I immediately went inside and wrote down what I had observed.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198

Three white lights in triangular form hovering over lake in Fort myers Florida;2008-01-24 06:30:00;10 minutes;Three white lights in triangular form hovering over lake in Fort myers Florida At about 6:30 am, with the sky still pitch dark, a friend of mine and I spotted a large bright light hover at a fast speed  across the lake we were sitting by. The light quickly disappeared, and then came back shining even brighter with two, albeit much dimmer lights above it,  altogether forming a triangle of three white lights. It was incredibly foggy out and almost impossible to see anything clearly 20 feet ahead of you, so it could not be determined if the lights were on the body of a ship or craft. The lights stayed in our vision hovering over the water for almost ten minutes, at a time appearing to move closer to us. The reflection of the lights could be seen in the water, so it was apparently very close to the lake. The lights began to slowly fade, and then came back bright for an instant. Immediately afterwards right by the white lights two smaller bright red lights flashed, out of no where, disappeared, and then everything was gone. Also the whole incident was completely silent and no noise from the craft or anywhere else for that matter could be heard.  It may also be important to note that before the sighting, the friend I was with and I both watched on YouTube the ABC News report of a man called “Prophet Yahweh” who demonstrated or at least seemed to demonstrate the ability to summon UFOs. I know how this may sound but whether the clip was a complete hoax or not, the two of us went outside by the lake for the sole reason of wanting to spot a UFO, we did all the kind of believing and makeshift praying we could and after about 45 minutes and having somewhat given up, witnessed what was previously described.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
Light split into four and one sped acros the sky;2008-12-01 21:40:00;5 minutes;Light split into four and one sped acros the sky I am writing this to document an incident that an associate witnessed  a few minutes ago. I did not see it myself. I will ask him to write down what he saw in the morning. I have listened to you on the Rense Program for many years reporting and interviewing witnesses. I do know what you are looking for. The observation was made on Cypress Lake Drive, and the object was in in the South sky. I would say the incident took place  due west of SWR airport, on but above what is the approach pattern to the airport and at that point where the flight path crosses the river. I would almost say it took place over Fort Myers Beach. Briefly he aid that there was a big light, in time the light split into four lights and one darted to the NE at great speed. I will follow up in the morning. ((ADDENDUM OF REPORT BY WITNESS)) Modification of earlier report Correction to earlier report.  I asked my associate for more detail.  It turns out that I misunderstood his earlier statement.  The event began just south of my house and in the clouds, so not high at all.  The object was very large.  I asked about the thumb nail test and he said much larger than the thumb, rather huge by comparison.  It was blue. there were no lights on the object.  It disgorged four other lights.  These lights he said then dived at one another and almost seemed to play.  The large object circled and passed over the house.  The location now moves to the intersection of Cypress Lake Drive and the river.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
two bright lights which faded slowly to disappear;2010-10-21 20:45:00;30 sec;two bright lights which faded slowly to disappear Two bright lights appeared near Jupiter that were about the same size as Jupiter.  They moved slowly toward the southeast and then became dim and eventually faded away completely.  It would be impossible for them to be satellites because they were to bright.   They were seen by a 52 yr old MD and his wife.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
Bright flashing light moving in a no repetitive and non linear pattern;2010-11-09 21:00:00;15 Min;Bright flashing light moving in a no repetitive and non linear pattern I was sitting outside with a friend and we noticed a light flash in the sky at about 170 degrees up from the southern horizon and about 10 to 15 degrees to the east. The light would flash with a single pulse every 5 to 8 seconds. We noticed the light was moving from one position to another between flashes or sometimes staying stationary for 5 or 6 Flashes and then moving in a non repetitive manner 5 to 15 degrees of arc east and west or NE, E , W, But never in the same spot after it moved and not in a regular direction. The light pulses were quite bright when observed in the original position and when it moved to the east and then back close to the original position. It then moved to the east and the light was less bright and appeared to be pointing in another direction to the east and on several pulses appeared almost as a ray. It then moved back west again close to the original position and then disappeared.  We could not gauge the height other than much higher than any of the aircraft in the area. If I had to guess I would say something in excess of 100,000 ft.  We also tried viewing it through a pair of 10 power binoculars but it did not give any more detail. One of the moves covered about 20 degrees in about 5 seconds or less. It was very rapid.  There was no sound.

Five lights in a V-shape flew over our heads.;2019-02-07 21:41:00;19 seconds;Five lights in a V shape flew over our heads. My husband and I were sitting in our driveway, plane watching, and 5 lights in a v shape flew over us, I'm estimating 8-10 thousand feet in the air.  The lights were blurry in focus and not as bright as a plane.  They were also flying faster in speed than an airplane.  We use the plane finder app to spot planes and they did not show up on the app and that’s also how I’m estimating height from seeing planes fly over at that height.  The lights made no sound as they flew over.  There was a fed ex plane in the vicinity of the formation based on my plane finder.   My husband and I both tried to video the event but it did not show up in the video.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
