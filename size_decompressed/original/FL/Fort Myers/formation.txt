Strange formation of lights in western sky over Fort Myers, FL.;2012-12-31 23:10:00;3-5 minutes;Strange formation of lights in western sky over Fort Myers, FL. In late afternoon, before dark, I noticed an unusual orangish-red light moving towards me in the Western sky.  I watched it for a few minutes and then went into my house.  I thought it strange because of its color.  Later that same night, December 31, 2012, at around 11:10 PM, I went outside to sit on my lanai.  I looked up and saw approximately 5 to 7 orangish-red, ball shaped lights moving across the sky in a strange formation.  It took approximately 3 minutes for the formation to disappear behind a large cloud bank.   I could not determine if the formation was a single large object with multiple lights or multiple objects.  My impression was that it was both.    When I first saw the formation, I immediately went into the house to get my camera.  I was able to capture video footage of the lights as well as a second video of another, single, light that appeared moments after the formation was lost to the clouds.   This second single light followed the same flight path as the formation, also disappearing into the same cloud bank.      Both the formation and the second single light moved steadily in a north-westerly direction.  They all appeared to have controlled flight - though it seemed more like gliding.    I did not see anything emerge from the clouds, perhaps because the bank was very large.  I could not see a glow or reflection through the clouds.  They made no sound I could hear.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
Boomerang-shaped black craft with lights over Fort Myers, Fl.;2014-10-17 21:01:00;12 seconds;Boomerang shaped black craft with lights over Fort Myers, Fl. My 12 yr old son and I were looking up in the sky using google star maps to look at constellations on our lainai at approx. 9p - the object was a curved boomerang shape with lots of white lights with red outer glow on the underside of it,  you could discern the harder outlined edge of the object behind the lights.   It was about helicopter height in the sky and below the regular flight paths of the RSW flights and glided silently North to South across the Gateway neighborhood. SR82 and Griffen Drive.  It was so quiet if we hadn't been looking up to star gaze we would not even have seen it at all.  It just vanished abruptly after 12 seconds or so.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
2 bright white lights, side by side.;2016-10-31 06:35:00;20-30 seconds;2 bright white lights, side by side. It was 6:35 A.M. and I noticed 2 bright lights in the northwestern sky, it was still dark.  If they were stars, I had never noticed them before in the morning sky.   I watched them for approximately 20 – 30 seconds.  They were side by side and very bright white, they never moved.  It was like they were on a dimmer switch, they then both faded to nothing.  I figured they were covered by clouds.   I watched for another 15–20 minutes, nothing reappeared.  I also realized that there were NO clouds in the sky.   They were NOT aircraft and there was no sound.   That’s it.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
