Saw object initially thought it was a plane.  But in comparison to blinking cell phone tower & amongst all other stars, this object was bright flashing moving colors & was static not moving.  It was far away & as bright as any star in sky.   I stared at it the whole 5 minutes.  I thought to take a photo, but didn't.  Then object moved & vanished all silent.  I stood in shock realizing what I saw.   Tonite I saw something with my eyes that was nothing like I ever saw in my life!!!!

Bright red object seen hovering over Ft. Myers, Florida.;2021-02-27 22:45:00;5 minutes;Bright red object seen hovering over Ft. Myers, Florida. At about 22:45 hours last night I went out on my lanai (screened in porch).  I have a great view to the south.  I saw this object just above my horizon, and it was less than one mile away from me.  It was a very bright red light or perhaps several lights stacked vertically (but on one object).  It was stationary.  I took video and several pictures but they were through my screen so the quality is not the best.  This object remained in place for 5 minutes.  I went inside briefly, then came back out to my porch but it was gone at this point.  If I were to place this object onto a map it would have been at the intersection of McGregor Blvd and Cypress Lake Dr.  My back round....I am a retired airline pilot and space enthusiast, having started building model airplanes when I was just six years old.  Safe to say I am familiar with everything that flys.  This object was too large to be a plane, and far too bright (no aircraft has the power to generate this much light).  It is also not a light on any kind of antenna.  It made no sound and remained stationary the whole time it was in view.  I have never seen anything like this during an entire lifetime spent in aviation.  This was not an aircraft maneuvering for RSW or Page Field.  It was also not one of the mosquito spraying aircraft that operate quite low.  To me this flying object is not identified.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
