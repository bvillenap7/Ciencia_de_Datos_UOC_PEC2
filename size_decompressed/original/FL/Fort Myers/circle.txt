Just like the round ride at walt disney world in epcot in florida.  It was about 3 times the size of a basketball.  It was gold in colour with no lights or numbers or letters.  It just sat 500 feet up in the sky, not moving.   We stood there for 1 hour watching and had to get back to work.  We looked and glanced up for another hour or so and, finaly it left.  I did not see it leave or how it left.  Never made a noise, stood perfectly still. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Disappearing light over Fort Myers;2008-04-25 21:11:00;1 minute;Disappearing light over Fort Myers My neighbor and I were talking out back and I looked up and saw a small white light moving very slowly across the sky, I told my neighbor to look at it. He noticed that there were no blinking lights on this object like a regular aircraft. The night is crystal clear and other planes lights were as clear as day. After watching it for about 1 minute it slowly faded away to nothing. Like I said before there were no clouds in the sky, and there were other aircraft in the sky in and around the same area, and were completely visible. Not quite sure what it was but I have never seen anything like it before.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
4-5 circle objects in sky.;2014-12-20 18:30:00;3 minutes;4-5 circle objects in sky. Looked in sky and I see a four or five perfect circles in South Fort Myers, FL by college parkway.  They were moving around where Cessnas fly (plane) if not a little lower.  There were around 3 circles grouped together and one then another behind that one maybe a mile apart from where I was standing.   I focused on the last one and there was a solid red light on the end of the circle.  They were not solid white however appeared to be a clear white color with the outlines seen.   There was an airplane taking flying in the sky with different lights and the objects were not phased by the plane.  As I watched them, there was no sound what so ever.

Large Circular Donut-Shaped UFO in Ft Myers Sky.;2018-11-07 19:00:00;5 minutes;Large Circular Donut-Shaped UFO in Ft Myers Sky. I saw a large circular donut-shaped UFO in the sky.  It appeared to have a white light going in a circular pattern around the object.  As I was staring at the UFO, I noticed a plane fly underneath it.  This gave me a better realization of how large this UFO craft really was. Which made the airplane seem a small fraction of the size of the UFO.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
((HOAX??))  It passed overhead moving from N to S at about 2000 ft on a slight angel.  ((anonymous report));2019-05-17 11:00:00;3 seconds;It passed over head moving from north to south at about 2000 ft on a slight angel as the usual planes come in for a landing at rsw.  It was 15 times the size of the usual planes.  But it had no actual surface.  it was a cloud like glow with a very defined perimeter.it defiantly was iluminated from a powered source.  Im relating the speed of the craft to multables of the usual planes that fly over head daily .  actualy every 15 min to land.  So they move at about 180 mph this moved so fast.  I cant explain of compare it to a plane.  2 maybe 3 seconds it was in space.  Ok thats it.  Unbelievable. ((NUFORC Note:  Original date was flawed.  Possible hoax??
