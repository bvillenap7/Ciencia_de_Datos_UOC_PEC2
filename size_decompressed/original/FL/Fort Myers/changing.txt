9/15/12, 4:00 Two round pulsating lights, changing colors, and shape seen over Ft Myers, Florida in south eastern sky. ((Planets?? PD));2012-09-15 04:00:00;20 minutes;9/15/12, 4:00 Two round pulsating lights, changing colors, and shape seen over Ft Myers, Florida in south eastern sky. At approximately 4:00AM on the morning of 9/15/12, I went to my porch to smoke, looked up in the south eastern sky, and saw two very bright pulsating round lights, distiguishable from the  surrounding stars.  They were very close, almost touching, turning red, blue, white with flashes or pulses. They were stationary. They did not seem to move. I woke my boyfriend.  He saw and was also surprised. It almost seemed like the two lights merged, creating a cylinder shape. This had my eyes squinching, trying to make out the changing shapes.  After 20 minutes of watching this, the lights faded out and were gone, like someone just shut off a light switch. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness was observing planets, but cannot be certain.

Recurring sighting in WSW sky, NOT Venus.;2013-10-08 19:14:00;60 minutes;Recurring sighting in WSW sky, NOT Venus This object has appeared on multiple nights, always between 7:15 PM and 8:30 PM, always in the WSW sky, and remains visible for approximately one hour.  It does not deviate in altitude. It changes between two forms, seemingly as it slowly rotates.  It is either a triple light or a single orb, always white, and changes in intensity.  I have watched it through binoculars and when it disappears, it quickly dims and just goes out.  It does not set. It does not fly away.   First the outer lights begin to dim, followed quickly by the center light until it is no longer visible.  I have never seen it reappear the same night.  There have been three adult witnesses to this and we all agree on the description.  First, we believed it to be Spica, then Venus.  But planets do not dim away nor do they have three distinct lights.  We first observed this in September and filed a report here at that time.  I have contacted our local control tower as we are a few miles from an airport, but they could offer no explanation.  After so many subsequent sightings I have decided to file an updated/new report for tonight's sighting.  Tonight's pictures are the best representation I have been able to capture, to date.  All three witnesses are responsible, non-drinking adults who would really love to know what it is that keeps appearing in our sky!;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
