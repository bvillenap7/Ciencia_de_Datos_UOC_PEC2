Pulsating light in western Florida sky.;2015-10-06 20:15:00;1 hour;Pulsating light in western Florida sky. Looking to the western sky about 90 degrees up, we were watching an object pulsating red,gree,white and other colors in a pattern.  When looking at it through binoculars we could see the colors coming from the sides.  To the left of us it appeared a smaller object was doing the same, in between 2 stars.  I am from NY and I don't get to see the night sky much so not sure what it is.  These were the only 2 objects doing this, the stars were twinkling but not pulsating colors.  Any ideas?  It was there the previous night and it is still there as I type.  A star?;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
