It seemed to be moving faster than an airplane at first, it slowed, stopped, and reversed direction and hovered.  Then disappeared so quickly it seemed to vanish.   Moments later a second one came floating from the same direction across the sky until it reached virtually the same location and then vanished as well.  It's path was more direct without stops and starts.
