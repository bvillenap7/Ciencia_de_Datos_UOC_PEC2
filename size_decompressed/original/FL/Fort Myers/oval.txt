It literally glistened in the darkening sky.  The object was huge, about the size of a baseball at arms length.  It appeared to be at least ten thousand feet altitude at 45 degrees.  It was not the moon, as the full moon was visable during the sighting.  The object followed the I-75 corrider through Fort Myers on the west coast of Florida.  I was west of the object looking east.  It became visable to me over the southeast portion of town and then it moved slowly north for about one minute.  I tried to reason this sighting as possibly a blimp.  But then it disapeared completely and reappeared roughly 5 miles north in less than 10 seconds.  It continued moving north slowly about four more minutes and faded in the distance behind cloud cover.  It appeared to be headed towards the Sarasota and Tampa area.  This object had to be sighted by many other people.  It looked like a well lit condominium building flying through the sky.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198

I had Bushnell 7X50 quick focus  binocular beside my chair which I always have there for the various birds we have in SW Florida and the not infrequent high flying plane. I had just been watching a very high flying jet traveling from NW to SE  and was looking at its con trail and I noticed a very shinny object at about 10-20 degrees north of vertical. It appeared to be very high and traveling very fast. By the time I picked up my binoculars and focused, it was directly over head. It was very reflective and appeared to be hazy or opaque around the edges. I would say it was a combination diamond, oval shape of a bright silver color. Within 4-6 seconds from vertical it had reached approximatly 45 degrees due south and abruptly disapeared. There was no con trail, there was no sound, the 7X50 binoculars did little to increase the size and the speed the object was traveling was very fast. I have observed many planes and satelites and this did not fit either catagory, nor was it swamp gas or a weather balloon.;26.5736153992395;-81.839426996198
