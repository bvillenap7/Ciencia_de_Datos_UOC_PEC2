My father and I were working that evening loading the harvest. This was less than 1/2 mile from my middle school right as night was approaching. We had farmed the property for sometime yet we saw a bright light up by the property owners house. The owner had a small air strip next to his property where his son would fly planes. I asked my father had the owner installed a new street light because over the trees about 600 ft away his house was really more well lit than I remember. We took our time and was heading home as usual when we noticed his property was extremely well illuminated as we were leaving. I looked up in the sky and saw what I took to be the moon but it was clearly not the moon it was a perfect sphere of light on a cloudless night. I could see what I took to be a UFO. It made no sounds and didn't seem to move. I looked at it long and hard to check and see if it had any crevices or imperfections, there were none I could see.  I wanted to make sure! I was seeing it so I ask my father did he know what the object was and did he see it.  He said he saw it and didn't know what it was. We didn't stop and headed home. I was bothered and terrified I had never seen a UFO before and haven't seen anything like it since.  I have been telling this story ever since. I feel liberated after officially telling this story after so long.  We were alone us two that night harvesting in a field about 20 acres or so big. I can't say it was a craft but I can tell you I felt like we were bieng watched. I got the same chills writing this story I got all those years ago. This is the first time I have written about this experience.;29.3983;-82.1098
