Brilliant Blue and Red Triangular object in the sky;2016-11-08 23:11:00;8 minutes;Brilliant Blue and Red Triangular object in the sky At 23:11 couldn't sleep, feeling antsy so I thought I would open blinds to let moonlight in. In the southeastern sky was a triangular shaped object with brilliant blue lights.  The lights would change from blue, to red to blue and red.  It was a very cloudy night and I wanted to go outside, but I was afraid it would disappear.  I tried to telepathically communicate with it, but it cloaked itself and I could still see dark gray edges.  It had not left, but I turned to look at the clock, and when I looked back it was gone.  23:19.;28.3299;-82.2849999999999
