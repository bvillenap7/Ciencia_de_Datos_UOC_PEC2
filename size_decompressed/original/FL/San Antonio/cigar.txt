At approximately 7:15pm EST on January 22th, 2017, San Antonio, Fl.   I looked out my front window at the oncoming storm and saw a strange object come out of the darkness above and travel directly across the sky extremely fast and disappear into the darkness (like a portal opened and closed on both ends of its journey).  This wasn't falling from the sky and wasn't on fire nor did it have a tail like a meteor typically would.  I don’t think it was a shooting star or lightning.   The object was a thin cigar shape and a bright white or a silver white glowing light and moved in a seemingly straight horizontal path.   It happened so quickly I did not have a chance to photograph it.  Because of the fast speed it traveled I don’t believe it was a plane, I have no idea what it was and wondered if anyone else saw it.;28.3299;-82.2849999999999
