Two objects flying together, with strange lights;2017-10-26 21:00:00;5 minutes;Two objects flying together, with strange lights We were at the Halloween horror theme park, Scream-a-geddon, waiting in line for the hayride.  I looked up into the trees, and saw two “airplanes” flying close to each other, side by side.  It was an odd way to be flying so close, so I took notice. I told my husband to look how close they were, and as he watched, they moved from. Ext to each other to over top of each other.  They were silent, and not helicopters. As me and my husband watched, trying to figure them out, we noticed the lighting was way different than airplanes.  It wasn’t blinking, it was flashing consstantky, with colors.  Like red, yellow, white, red, yellow, white... in a cir Jose formation, not a blinking red light, like a plane.  They slowed down once they moved in the vertical formation, and disappeared behind the trees.  I can’t stop thinking about them, they were silent, ave;28.3299;-82.2849999999999
