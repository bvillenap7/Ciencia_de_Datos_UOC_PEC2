three diamond shaped constatnt lights in asymetrical steday formation flying from north to south horizons;2006-11-08 21:00:00;2 minutes;three diamond shaped constatnt lights in asymetrical steday formation flying from north to south horizons At approximately 9:pm, i was standing outside my home in hollywood florida.  i looked up into the northern sky, and immediately saw three diamond shaped constatnt lights that appeared to be very high in the sky.  they actually appeared to be of the same light magnitude as the stars in the sky.  two of the lights were positioned very close to eachother, while the third light was offset to the west of the two.  all three lights were moving at the same, very rapid speed, and were perfectly in line with eachother.  the lights were moving steadily from the north to the south, and were visible all the way to the horizion be fore they disapeared from sight in the due south sky.  i had called to my wife to come and see these lights, she came out when the lights were directly overhead, and watched with me til they disapeared at the southern horizon.  the lights were constant and never blinked.  they appeared to be quite high in the sky, in fact they had the same altitude appearance of when i have seen the international space station fly overhead.  from the time i 1st noticed the lights, they were about 45 degrees above the northern horizion, til the time they disapeared at the southern horizion, approximately 2 minutes had elapsed.  three diamond shaped constatnt lights flying in a a-symetrical formation from the north horizion to the south horizon.  very strange indeed;26.0057865671641;-80.2425845771145
