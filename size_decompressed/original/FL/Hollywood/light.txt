Four of them in a square (two vertically on top of two others) and then one floating below. They did not seem to be moving fast but they seem to move out of the square formation and were moving east slowly.  They really looked like Chinese lanterns but I have never seen anyone release one of those off of our coast before.  The thing that was so odd was how vivid their orange glowing characteristics were when compared to an airplane that was nearby.  There is also an international airport within a couple miles, however, these orbs were not any plane that we have ever seen before.  Anyhow, eventually we drove beyond a tree line where we could not see them anymore but they got really small as the seemed to be heading east.  Wondering if anyone in the area saw this as well and have a clue as to what it could be? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

A bright red light, 2015 a year I wont forget.;2015-01-01 04:15:00;20 minutes;A bright red light,2015 a year i wont forget. It's a new year and I'm already seeing things right before my eyes.   Me and my boyfriend were talking outside when he looks up in the sky and sees a red, bright, circular light in the sky.  The way it was moving was strange and it kept flickering as proceeding further up.  It was definitely not an airplane,without a doubt.  I guess even others take a holiday vacation to Florida!&#128561 ...HAPPY New lightyears, I guess.;26.0057865671641;-80.2425845771145
