Orange Orbs in Broward County Florida.;1994-04-04 17:00:00;2 hrs;Orange Orbs in Broward County Florida. I was sitting in a chair facing east talking to my former brother-in-law out side of his parents house in the driveway.  I first saw 3 round orange orbs above the tree line heading south.  They were equal distance apart from each other and if you put both arms foward and made them into a circle that about how big they were from my point of view.  They made no noise and all traveled at the same speed. The only way to explain the speed is as I saw the orbs and I said to my former brother-in-law look and pointed with my finger by the time he turned around they were out of our view.  I saw a few more and my former brother-in-law still did not see them and thought I was screwing around.  I ran inside and got the phone.  I called the FT. Lauderdale airtraffic control tower.  I told them that this was not a prank call and they could call the police and I explained what I had saw and he told me their was nothing on radar.  I sat outside for a few more hours this time with a camera but they were to fast to focus on.  I counted a total of 11 with in 2 hours all going south, all flying the same pattern.  I believe this was in 1994 but I can't be sure.  I have told some people but I think they thought I was making it up.  I know what I saw, I know your thinking why did I not write sooner.  I have no answer to you except that I want people to know now what I saw then.  I have another incident to share with you but I will wait to see how this one goes.  KEEP LOOKING UP!

Huge round craft sparkling fluorecent in yellow & orange emitting electrical flames out of the bottom;2012-10-19 23:00:00;4 seconds;Huge round craft sparkling fluorecent in yellow & orange emitting electrical flames out of the bottom It was on clear night on October 19th, 2012 at 11pm when I was outside in Hollywood Florida. I happened to look at the northern sky when suddenly this huge beautiful round craft appeared just about 500 yards infront of me, maybe 300 yards of the ground the size of a football field, maybe 3 stories high. It was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen !!!  It was huge, round, with perfect straight outlines.  The whole craft lit up as bright as the sun in many fluorescent colors, mainly bright yellow and orange. It stood perfectly still in the air, about 300 yards of the ground and discharged large electrical flames out of the bottom, all the way around the craft. The flames were the same color of the ship and looked like a form of zig zack about 40-50 feet deep coming to a perfect point on the bottom.  Oh my God!  That thing was the most beautiful thing someone could ever imagine ! I could see the whole thing clear, no blurr...it  appeared to be hollow in the center, like a big ring, but because of the night, it could have been just a dark center. I never seen it fly up, it just suddenly appeared and made this spectacular light show, standing still in the air, for about one second, then the lights went out and after a blink of an ! eye, about 1/10 of a second, it dropped about 50 yards straight down and stood still and lit up again doing its light show, like yellow and orange colors going vertical around the  craft...the top half turning one way, the bottom half turning the other way, like against each other and at the same time discharging these long pointy electrical flames towards the bottom all the way around. It made no noise, it was totally silent. Then all lights went out again and for the 3rd time, after 1/10 of a second it appeared again another 50 yards deeper then before and lit up again . I am not talking about a craft with lights, I am talking about the whole ship looked like one big sparkling light, but yet with clear sharp outlines and perfect pointy flames shooting out of the bottom. The whole spectacle lasted only about 4 seconds and after the lights went out the 3rd time, it was gone. I never seen it fly up nor fly away.  Basically it just dropped out of the sky 3 times 50! yards and stopped in between as fast as your eye would blink!   After i t was all over, I could not believe what I saw for days, weeks and months...but I know what I saw was the most beautiful space ship ever and so close to me.  I had no camera, and even if I would have had one, there would have been not enough time to snap a picture.  Too bad, but I can make a drawing on request.;26.0057865671641;-80.2425845771145
Solid blue-green circular light remained stationary over Hollywood, Florida's sky for several minutes;2014-05-04 23:30:00;>15 minutes;Solid blue-green circular light remained stationary over Hollywood, Florida's sky for several minutes I was walking home from work near midnight when I noticed it.  It was a solid blue-green color that remained stationary in the sky for several minutes.  It couldn't have been a plane and after 10 minutes of watching it, it descended downward and then remained in position for a while longer.  I went home and don't know what happened with it.;26.0057865671641;-80.2425845771145

It had four lights side by side and there were beams of light coming off of it.   It didn't move, it was fixed, so it changed position in the sky as time went on.;26.0057865671641;-80.2425845771145
Bright white circle, high speed travel and large rapid U-turns.  ((anonymous report));2016-09-26 07:30:00;30 seconds;Bright white circle, high speed travel and large rapid U-turns. On front porch having my coffee and a smoke, my son came out to leave for work.  I looked up and saw a bright white light.  Thought it was a star or a planet.  Then it started moving.  When it made a large and very rapid U-turn, I knew it was not a plane.  I was saying oh my goodness - repeatedly.   My son came to me and he saw the object traveling at high speed and making additional large rapid U-turns. I ran inside to get my camera.  When I returned, he said it turned from a bright white to red and then disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Five white dots seen by four over Hollywood Beach, FL;2020-03-24 07:30:00;1 hour;Five white dots seen by four over Hollywood Beach, FL This morning from 0730 to 0810 there were five white circular discs hovering over Van Buren Street and the Broadwalk at Hollywood Beach at the Broadwalk.  They were very high and there were four of us watching them.  Their movement was very slow.  They were not affected by the wind which blew at about 15 mph from the east the Atlantic Ocean. I am a photographer and using my 300mm lens got several photos of them.  The four of us wonder if they were either white weather balloons, drones or UFO’s. A policeman passed by on the Broadwalk and I mentioned it to him, without looking he said they were drones.  I’m not sure if he made a report of it or if he notified his superiors. We left after about an hour and the objects were still there.;26.0057865671641;-80.2425845771145
