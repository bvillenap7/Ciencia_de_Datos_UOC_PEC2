A silent, slow moving oval craft followed my four diamond shaped objects.;1981-06-10 23:00:00;30 seconds;A silent, slow moving oval craft followed my four diamond shaped objects. I was 13 years old in 1981. On a clear, dark night in June, my friend, who was 12 and I were spending the night in my treehouse. We had decided to go for a walk in the field behind my house. We looked up into the sky and to the North, we saw a yellow-orange colored oval (laying sideways) shaped UFO that was slowly crossing the sky from the East to the West. Four white diamond shaped objects appeared from the tail end of the oval and followed it in a straight line. I remember turning to my friend and asking him if he was seeing what I was seeing. He said that he was and that we weren't dreaming.  We watched it for about 25 seconds, then while they were traveling, the last diamond object emitted a bright red light and then shot quicky back and downwards in a arc away from the others. The other three then continued moving West in a straight line for a few seconds, then took off at a high rate of speed in different directions.  Following this, the oval object paused for 3 or 4 seconds then shot into the sky at a 45 degree angle at a high rate of speed. We watched it until it went out of site.
