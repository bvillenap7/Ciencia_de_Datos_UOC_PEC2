Lights did not pulse and were extremely large but did not cast a beam onto the clouds it was as if it was a glow and not a bulb light.   Lights suddenly turned bright red in an instant.  Object about minute  later came to an abrupt halt.  The object made zero sounds and was very close by.   When we pointed at it and made a comment about it not even moving a tiny bit on a very windy night it dropped very quickly straight down almost like an elevator with zero hesitation dropping out of sight.   We ran to the street to get a better look and the object shot straight up into the sky and out of site. Never seen anything like it before.;26.0057865671641;-80.2425845771145
