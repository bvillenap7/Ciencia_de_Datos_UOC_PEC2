7 spheres sighted  in broad daylight,3 in triangle shape formation.hollywood,fl.;2002-01-20 15:30:00;10-15 minutes;7 spheres sighted  in broad daylight,3 in triangle shape formation.hollywood,fl. I was at a friends house in hollywood Fl.,on jan.20,2002.It was between 2:15 and 2:30 in the afternoon.The moon was out and it was a clear blue cloudless sky.I was walking back to the house after getting something out of my car when I glanced at the moon.Just as I was turning away from the moon,I caught a glint of what looked like  sunlight on metal.I stopped to see what it was and saw 1 spherical shaped object hovering in the sky.As iI watched that for a few seconds,another object exactly like the first 1 appeared seemingly out of nowhere.After a few more seconds ,a 3rd,4th,5th,6th and 7th object appeared.Three of the objects moved into a triangle shaped formation,while the other 4 hovered on either side of the formation.These spheres appeared to be out over the water in relation to my location.They would have been from the view from ((number deleted)) and johnston street area to be in the east over the hollwood beach ocean area.They looked to be a good distance up in the sky,I estimate between 15-20 miles up at least.There where 2 other witness's that I called out to.They both saw several objects but could not tell what they were either.One witness is a charter boat captain,and guess that they were out at least 30-40 miles over the water and about 20 miles up.The other witness works as in retail sales in a major chain store.These are both reliable people .The spheres looked exactly like the pstring of pearl ufo's seen in mexico and in utah,and in washington back in the 50's.If anyone else had a similar sighting at or about that time,or,with the same objects,I would like very much to hear about it.;26.0057865671641;-80.2425845771145

Then,in a mater of less than 15 seconds,there were 7 orb shaped bright white objects floating in the sky.I watched as 3 of them formed a triangle,while the other 4 took up formation on either side of the triangle,2 on each side. The objects were about the size of a BB when held at arms length.As I looked at the objects,I noticed that 1 of the orbs actually looked to be 3 maybe 4 orbs either right next to each other,or were actually attached. There is the possibility of there being at least 10 orbs.The sighting lasted for 15+ minutes.  The objects were definately out over the atlantic ocean,directly off of Hollywood beach.Ive been trying for the last few years to see if anyone else saw these objects.I find it hard to beleive that nobody else did.

Bright circular light moves towards the Atlantic Ocean and disappears at an incredible speed.;2008-11-17 18:40:00;2 minutes;Bright circular light moves towards the Atlantic Ocean and disappears at an incredible speed. We saw a bright light in the sky, above either Jupiter or Venus (both were very bright in the sky).  Its brightness was more than Jupiter, but less than Venus.  It was moving northeastwards towards the Atlantic.  At first we thought it was an airplane, but the brightness remained constant even after it passed over us.  Also, it was constant and not blinking, so we did not think it could have been an airplane.  It was way too bright to be an airplane, regardless.  So this circular, very bright light is moving towards the Atlantic, and in the span of 5 seconds it goes from very bright to dim to disappeared.  We think it accelerated very quickly and took off outta here. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));26.0057865671641;-80.2425845771145
