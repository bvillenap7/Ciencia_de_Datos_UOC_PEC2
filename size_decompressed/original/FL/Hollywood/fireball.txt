It was moving at a slower pace than nearby aircraft and looked like the fire was pulsating. It also seemed to slow down then speed up.  After about 3 minutes, the fire extinguished and the ball disappeared.  I don't know what it was but I looked up other reports of this sort of thing and came across this website.;26.0057865671641;-80.2425845771145

I looked over at the passenger seat where I was trying to keep a flower arrangement steady and when I looked forward again, I notice in the upper left quadrant of my vision, a light suspended  across from and above the hospital (which is 8 stories tall) and at first I thought it might be a sodium lamp suspended from a crane atop a building.  Then it occurred to me that there were no other tall buildings in the area. I pulled to the side of the street in someone's driveway so I could let the traffic go around me while I observed the light.  I thought about using my Blackberry to photograph the light, but the Blackberry has terrible low light capabilities.  The light was now to my left and above, at about a 70 degree angle. I was trying to gage its motion to determine what t! he rate of speed might be.  Fort Lauderdale Airport is not far from this location and I thought this might be an aircraft.  However, the light was mor or less drifting and the speed would not have been enough to produce lift for even the smallest aircraft. Upon further observation the light was actually more like a torch, flame colored but fairly steady in intensity.  It did not flicker but the light had the quality of a flame.  I observed the light for about 2 minutes before it rose into the cloud cover and faded.  I immediately called 911 and informed them that I had seen a flame in the sky and they took my contact information.;26.0057865671641;-80.2425845771145
Misterious ball of fire and smoke over Hollywood FL on 12-25-2012 @ 13:33;2012-12-25 13:33:00;2 minutes;Misterious ball of fire and smoke over Hollywood FL on 12-25-2012 @ 13:33 While traveling east on Taft St. at the traffic light of Taft and 441 in the eastern sky we saw a ball of fire slowly descending in an angle like if it was trying to get the perfect angle for landing. The ball of fire was golden with heavy black smoke.  I drove east on Taft thinking it can be a small aircraft accident but found nothing.  Checked Sheridan and Stirling road with no luck.  No signs of a fire on any house. Nothing was reported on the news.;26.0057865671641;-80.2425845771145
