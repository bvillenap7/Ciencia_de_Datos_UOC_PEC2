I went to let the dog out and looked up into the sky to see a burning object flying across the sky moving from west to east.   I ran into the house to get my son, who came out to witness it.  It appeared to move faster than a plane and not as fast a falling star.   It was a glowing flame that was orangish in color.   I saw it for a total of 45 seconds and my son saw it for 15 seconds.  The glowing flame just disappeared and seemed to burn out. ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));29.2887936599419;-81.0847980787677
