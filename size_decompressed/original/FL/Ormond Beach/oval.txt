A comet-like object with a vapor trail behind it hovering above trees;2003-09-25 10:30:00;approx. 3 mins;A comet-like object with a vapor trail behind it hovering above trees There was only one object, it looked like a comet, it was circular like a 3D circle with a small vapor trail following about 1-2 feet behind it. It was just hovering there, not moving. I noticed that there was no wind whatsoever, but trees directly under the thing were swaying. I quickly moved myself to the end of the line so I could see it longer. It was still hovering, and the line started moving. We were in the cafeteria for approx. 5 minutes to get our lunches, and we were heading back to the classroom. I was telling all of my friends, but they couldn't see anything. I looked myself and saw that whatever it was, it was gone. There was no sound or any feeling of static electrictity, and the lights in the lights in the classrooms were still working. It was  just usual Florida weather (sunny, warm, LOTS of humidity). It was a nice day with no rain or anything all day. I also noticed that you had a sighting in Plant City, FL. I was wondering if there was any connections...;29.2887936599419;-81.0847980787677
