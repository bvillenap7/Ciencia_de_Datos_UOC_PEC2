Large triangular object floating slowly through Ormond Beach, Florida.;2011-07-17 23:00:00;4 Minutes;Large triangular object floating slowly through Ormond Beach, Florida. I was making my way North on Nova Road when I saw a large triangular shaped object in the sky with lights on it.  I believe the colors of the lights were mixed blue (or white) and red.   It started near the church and seemed to follow me as I made a right on to Granada Avenue.  I tried to use my phone to call some one but instead of ringing or making a busy tone it sounded like waves of white noise.  I went back and waited to see if it would appear again, but it didn't.   When I got back home I google'd the object, and then google'd the city.  And I found out some one had seen the same thing fourteen years ago and reported it in the same area. Here is the link to the other one, I thought I should post my sighting just to verify that there has been more than one sighting of the same type object in this area. http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/044/S44222.html   Also, there are red blinking radio towers near the location I described, these lights are not what I saw, it was a completely different object, large and cruising through the air, not close and not far away.;29.2887936599419;-81.0847980787677
V-Shaped cloudy object with 6 lights.;2014-03-19 21:00:00;15 minutes;V-Shaped cloudy object with 6 lights. Saw lights in a v-shape formation move across the sky silently.  Seemed almost cloudy around it.  Could see through it, like it was a boomerang shape instead of a full triangle.  V shape was narrow compared to the stealth bomber.  Witnessed by two people.  After losing sight and still looking at the stars for a while, I saw it, or a second, come back around.  This time I counted 6 lights, 3 on each side.;29.2887936599419;-81.0847980787677
