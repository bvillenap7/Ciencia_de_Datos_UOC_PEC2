Looking at a relatively clear Northwest evening sky (some scattered light haze) I observed what I surmised to be a slow moving aircraft turn on it's very bright white landing lights on an apparent approach to Daytonna Airport which was a few miles to the South of my location near the intersection of Florida SR 40 and SR A1A in Ormond Beach. After observing the aircraft for about 15 seconds I saw two small round dull red lights, many hundreds of yards apart, appeared over the airplane at 45 degrees above the horizon. The two red lights moved perfectly in unison, first moving away from each other, then almost converging and finally travelling at their original spacing before disappearing near tree top level to the West. The two red lights had a unique deep dull red hue which did not change in color or intensity. The lights movements through the sky approximated the shape of an hour glass. No noise was heard from the lights. The two red lights were visible for 10 seconds. After the red lights disappeared the landing lights from the plane (helicopter?) switched off and the aircraft disappeared into the evening sky.;29.2887936599419;-81.0847980787677
red lights that moved over ocean.  they appeared and disappeared at regular intevals and appear to jump down beach;2010-10-19 21:00:00;10 minutes;red lights that moved over ocean.  they appeared and disappeared at regular intevals and appear to jump down beach On first night (10-18), saw 1 very bright red light over ocean above the horizon.  It slowly faded in and out and then repeated approx 45 sec later.  This happened 4 times and then light completely disappeared.   On 10-19, saw one very bright red light that bounced bac and forth for approx 2-3 minutes.  Then moved down beach approx 10 miles and showed as 2 distinct red leghts that blinked of on on for another 1-3 minutes.  The lights then moved another 10 miles down beach and blinked on and off.  This continued in approx 2-3 minute intervals up beach until disappeared out of site.   Was not a plane because there were palne light around that were completely different from way these were blinking.   Also plane lights do not just diappear for 30-60 seonds at a time and move together.;29.2887936599419;-81.0847980787677
Multiple sightings.;2014-07-16 05:00:00;35 minutes;Multiple sightings During the middle of June, my roommate and I had witnessed a rather bright star over Ormond beach on beach side.  We live on the intercostal and work nights so often like to hang out and talk on the balcony after work anywhere between 2-5 am.   On one night we witnessed this really bright star which then grew into a thin crescent shape.  Assuming we were crazy and seeing the moon behind clouds, we searched to finde the moon which we then realized at the time was behind us.  At this point the bright light turned crescent went back to a bright light with a tail as if the crescent got cut in half,  (at this time I called my boyfriend in hysterics trying to explain the sighting but he doesn't believe) soon after it then fade to just a star then disappeared into thin air.  It didn't appear for the rest of the night.   Later on in the week, it appeared again, this time a little more south and didn't change into a crescent shape, but did grow a tail of light like a shooting star.  Then the tail of light slowly faded, but the light grew bigger as if it was closer then ended up fading out and disappearing.  We witnessed it two more times the last time being tonight the 16th.  Tonight my boyfriend was present to assure I wasn't crazy!  Tonight I seen it first as a bright colorful flashing star, which my boyfriend always claimed as satilites in the sky.  But this flashing light soon turned into a bright white light and then it ends up turning into a crescent shape and then back to a bright star then disappeared.  All the sightings last about 30 mins but randomly in the early AM, sometimes higher sometimes just a over beachside Ormond.   Thanks to the last sighting my bf believes me finally!  Lol It drives me crazy to not be able to explain these sights at all!  I have video of the light going from dark to bright.;29.2887936599419;-81.0847980787677
Lightning flash, followed by floating bright light seen in Ormond Beach, FL, early Easter morning.;2015-04-05 02:30:00;30 minutes;Lightning flash followed, by floating bright light seen in Ormond Beach, Florida early Easter morning. I was visiting my cousin at her condo in Ormond Beach.  Her place is on the ground floor directly across the street from the ocean.  There were no stars in the sky.  I saw what appeared to be a lightning flash in the distance.   Then in the same space I saw a very bright light.  I thought it was too bright for a star and it seemed to be moving towards me.  I tried to film, but all I had was my cell phone and I am not good at using the video.  Anyway I did not get any pictures, just a black screen.   I watched for around 30 minutes and actually felt quite nervous.  Suddenly two guys came up the stairs off the beach and startled me.  I closed the shutter and went to bed.;29.2887936599419;-81.0847980787677

We were on U.S. 1 when she first sighted a green, firework-like light hovering in the sky's distance. 2 seconds later, she witnessed it shoot up. About 15 minutes later, we had gone northbound on the I-95, and I caught a quick glimpse of a dim light (dim due to distance) shoot from above my windshield, and head north. When I arrived to work, 3 hours into my shift, I check my phone and an article was posted, WITH video, about a North Carolina man on a Ferry with multiple witnesses who caught footage of 5+ lights above the ocean.;29.2887936599419;-81.0847980787677
