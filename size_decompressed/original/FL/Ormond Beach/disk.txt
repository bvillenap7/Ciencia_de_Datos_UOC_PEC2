Observed 5 white disks in a wedge formation, color white traveling south at approximately 400 knots.  I estimate their altitude at about 8,000 feet.   What causes me to report this is they were in a controlled air space.   I am a retired Army officer and have never observed such craft.;29.2887936599419;-81.0847980787677
