Series of 6 orange red silent unknown objects.;2013-03-11 22:45:00;6-7 minutes;series of 6 orange red silent unknown objects My boyfriend was sitting outside smoking on the screened porch,he called out to me to come and explained to me that he saw a series of planes (4) that he thought were on fire as he saw an orange glow,very bright on each one. `I thought he was losing it until i saw it for myself.I saw 2, so thats a total of six,they glowed a bright orange red,as if on fire,funny thing is they flew like a jet or helicopter,but there was absolutely no engine sound.  They were heading North from the South,in a single file line, no more than 1,000 feet out.  Which is directly on the coastline,and appeared to be no more than 1,000 ft in the air.It was Bike Week so we will be surprised if nobody else saw anything.  They flew in line like birds do,a few minutes apart,say 1-3mins.apart,headed North towards Jacksonville,FL.  I watched the last one until it left my field of vision,knowing that it flew a direct shoreline course to at least 20 miles North of my condo, at least past Flagler Beach, FL.;29.2887936599419;-81.0847980787677
I observed something very strange on evening of June 10, 2016.;2016-06-10 21:12:00;3 minutes;I observed something very strange on evening of June 10, 2016, at approximately 9:10pm EST.   I was outside in my side yard looking West when from my left (South) I observed what appeared to be a fireball entering from high in the South.  It traveled North North West.  It was approximately 3 times brighter than Jupiter (which was up) and very bright white yellow orange and had a slight tail pointing South.   I instantly thought fireball, but the object was slowing down, so I instantly thought this object was space junk.   This object was dropping what appeared to be hot material that was same color as the object.  The object continued to slow down and dripped the strange material two times on its trajectory before the object slowed to a complete static stop.  I was baffled to say the least.   As the object remained stationary, it dripped the bright material momentarily.  The flight time from when I saw the object to when it came to a complete static stop was approximately 10 seconds - which is far too long of a time for any fireball or space junk, which I've witnessed countless times.  I observed this object stationary for approximately 2 minutes in absolute amazement.   I had my iPhone in my hand and shot one still photo of the object prior to it coming to a complete stop and I shot video as well.  All you can see is a small dot due to iPhone camera not suited for shooting in dark.  It also showed up on the video.   While observing the object stationary for approximately 2 minutes I decided to take a chance a run in the house a grab a real camera, which only took about 2 minutes to retrieve, when I went back outside it was gone and I have no idea what happened to it.   I've been a dedicated amateur astronomer for over 40 years and I know the sky well. Also visible were commercial jetliners in the sky in the same general area of the sky.  This was neither a fireball or space junk - they don't slow down and come to a complete stop in the sk! y as this object did.  It was not the Moon, which was up and in a different part of the sky. It was not Jupiter, which was up and in a different part of the sky.  It was not Mars, which was up and in a different part of the sky.  It was not a satellite.  It was not the ISS.   I'm hoping that others observed this object and will make reports.;29.2887936599419;-81.0847980787677

There are several park benches;2019-05-21 22:25:00;15 minutes;My husband and i live right next to the Halifax River and approximately a mile from the Granada Bridge.  There are several park benches along a pathway beside the river across from our house, and we walked over there this evening to have a break and to enjoy the evening in the night skies.  And looking toward what would be the end of the Granada bridge going into A1A at the beach, we noticed three round lights they were spread pretty far apart from each other, and although all three lights are lit at one time, when one light would go off another one would come on, and then another one would go off and another one would come on.  It was just real slow and silent.  And it was in one position for a little while and then it went off completely, and then it was in a different position in another location just probably several feet from that one, and it was not running in a straight line.  And then it turn completely off for a bit, and then it showed back up again completely in another location & the lights kept doing that same thing.  And then they all went off again. And we didn't see it again after that.  And we walked back over to the house.  Not sure what we saw, but it was definitely not an airplane, because he was moving in an erratic pattern.  And it made no noise as it hovered what seemed like just you know maybe a mile above the building line.;29.2887936599419;-81.0847980787677
