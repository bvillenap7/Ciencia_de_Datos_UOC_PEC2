Fire ball over ormond beach fl;2012-10-07 21:00:00;30 seconds;fire ball over ormond beach fl My husband and I had just eaten a seafood dinner on our last night of our mini vacation. We decided to take a stroll on the beach before going up to the room for the night.  We were standing out by the pool of our hotel watching the ocean.  There was a mild breeze and we had just looked at the phone clock it was 9:02 pm.  I pointed to my husband at a strange orange light ball in the sky. It was moving south to north in a slow straight pattern.  It looked like a fireball and lit the sky up.  It made no sound.We watched it move horizontally for 30 seconds and then it just disappear.;29.2887936599419;-81.0847980787677
Fireball object in Ormond beach;2013-01-01 00:37:00;2 minutes;Fireball object in Ormond beach I was walking the dog and watching the fireworks towards the beach.  Then I saw the red fireball light moving upward. I thought it was another firework so I waited for it to go off.  It didn't, it just kept going up.  Then I thought to myself well maybe it's a missile or rocket from the space center but no it couldn't be. It is way to far north and it was out in the water.  So I ran in the house to get my wife so she could see it.  Came back out and it was still there but had leveled off.  It just kept moving away from the shore until it just disappeared.

Orange glowing object racing though the sky.;2018-12-31 21:41:00;20 seconds;Orange glowing object racing though the sky. After leaving a local restaurant my wife and I saw a orange glowing object that speed across the sky.  No noise and it was probable 1,000 feet up in the air.  I operate a drone and I know what a drone would look like in the sky.  At first we though it was a Chinese lantern, but it was much larger than that.;29.2887936599419;-81.0847980787677
