These lights would disappear and reappear in the same general area at one point we saw four separate objects light up then go off.  We sit out there all the time and many airplanes fly over on a regular basis so we know they were not planes.  I have know logical explanation for these lights.  I wonder if anybody else saw these lights?;29.2887936599419;-81.0847980787677
