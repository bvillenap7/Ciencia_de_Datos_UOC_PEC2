The object was black in clor and remained perfectly still in the sky.  There was no movement what-so-ever, not even wind movement.   When the sun came up completely, the object then appeared to have a faint orange circular glow around it that was not visible prior, or in the picture I took.   I was unable to observe it for longer than an hour.  However it was still there when I left my house.   When I returned home in the afternoon, it was not longer there.;29.2887936599419;-81.0847980787677
