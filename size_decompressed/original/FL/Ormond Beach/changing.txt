My wife and I witnessed beach and sky activities as follows:  Orange, red fire structured presence on the beach, winked gone reappeared high in the sky three times (clock referal) 10.00... 2:00   3:00.  Facing due east.   All winked gone in 12 seconds.   My wife witnessed the third sky site, proceeding south.   Likely unrelated, our building lost one third power today at 1:30 PM. ((name and e-address of witness deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  He stated that he did not believe that the objects could possibly have been so-called Chinese lanterns.  PD));29.2887936599419;-81.0847980787677
