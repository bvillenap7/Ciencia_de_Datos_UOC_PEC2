I looked up in the sky and noticed a boomerang-shaped metallic object flying low, it made no noise as it moved.  There were no lights but I could still tell it had a metallic aura.  The object was flying back and forth then left to right.  It held its position for a few seconds after about 10 seconds into watching it.  All of a sudden it started flying at a really fast rate of speed.  I could no longer see it within 5 seconds.;28.5836000000007;-81.5323999999976
