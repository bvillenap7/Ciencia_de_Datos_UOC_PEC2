Orangish red glow streaking across the sky at low altittude, high speeds.;2015-07-25 00:25:00;1 second;Orangish red glow streaking across the sky at low altittude, high speeds. 2 times this week, I have seen an orangish red glow speed through the sky.  First time was 07/22/15 at about 0300, was seen in the northern sky over Ocoee, FL.  Lasted less than a second, appeared what seemed to be about 500ft up streaked west to east in the blink of an eye the disappeared.  Seen again in southern sky, same starting view point.  Appeared over the turnpike in Ocoee and streaked east to west, extremely fast.  Over a miles distance across the sky then diappeared.  Hard to tell the shape because it was moving so fast.  Both seemed to be at the same altittude.  And lasted less than 2 seconds;28.5836000000007;-81.5323999999976
