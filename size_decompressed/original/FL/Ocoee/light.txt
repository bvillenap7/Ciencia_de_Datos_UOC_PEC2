Glowed orange and green with 2 second intervals I was at an intersection and while sitting at the red light i looked over the tree line to see and very large light.  About the size if you were to hold a penny up to the sky.  But it wasn't moving, it sat there and flashed Orange and Green with about an 2 second interval.  Did this for about 10 seconds before it shrank into the size of a normal star glowing blue and suddenly disappeared...this would make my 6th sighting;28.5836000000007;-81.5323999999976
3 orange-ish red lights hovering for five minutes.;2017-07-07 21:21:00;5 minutes;3 orangeish red lights hovering for five minutes. Sitting on porch.  At 21:21 I was already looking at night sky with no disturbance, out of nowhere, three orangeish red lights appeared automatically they were not far nor close. They didn't come from above or below.  They stayed.  Hovering east to west.  One faded, then two faded and the third stayed a full minute longer before fading.   At first sight, I jumped up and the other two people followed and stood behind me, I have video and film.;28.5836000000007;-81.5323999999976
Bright light that disappeared.;2018-04-06 20:34:00;15 seconds;Bright light that disappeared My fianc√© and I were sitting in our backyard, watching the stars, and he saw a very bright light moving quickly through the sky a distance away.  I looked and saw it, too, and a few seconds later, the light became dimmer, and then a few seconds after that, it completely disappeared.   We kept watching in the direction it was previously headed, but saw nothing.;28.5836000000007;-81.5323999999976
