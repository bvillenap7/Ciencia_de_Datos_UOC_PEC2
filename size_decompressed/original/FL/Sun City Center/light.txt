Twice, sighted stationary bright star in the blue day time sky;2003-01-09 16:40:00;5 Seconds;Twice, sighted stationary bright star in the blue day time sky Bright Star in the day time sky. 16:40  I spotted what appeared to be a bright star like object about 55 degrees above the southern horizon, against a blue sky. The object was stationary, best described as star like.  I watched it intensely for 5 seconds, there was no indication of movement. Altitude of the object I estimate at 35,000 to 40,000 feet. I was in the passenger seat of a vehicle driven by my wife and didn't make any comments to her as she drove. I lost sight of the object in some trees near the side of the road. As my view became unobstructed, I could no longer locate the object. I then mentioned what I had seen. 09:40 The next day on our daily walk I glanced up to the same segment of the sky to see another star like object of the same size and altitude. And in the same approximate location of the previous afternoon. I called my wife's attention to the stationary object and she saw it for 2 of the 3 seconds I was aware of it before it was obscured by clouds.;27.7152;-82.3513
