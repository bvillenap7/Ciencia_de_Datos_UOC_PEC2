Pulsating Cluster of Lights.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have been observing a twinkling star.  PD));2015-10-31 02:00:00;On going;Pulsating Cluster of Lights At first sight, we thought it was a jet plane because it seemed to be flashing red, white, and blue.  But after watching for about an hour (and I've seen it other nights before, always thought it was an active plane route, didn't think much of it). However, tonight, I saw it was relatively still and flashing more colors (blue, red, green, yellow, white), SO I got out binoculars and I can only describe it as a cluster of multi- colored lightning almost.  But the colored strands seemed to move and make different shapes. It almost resembled a flower at one point.  So weird.   I found some similar pictures on Google and people were calling it a UFO.  Also, found another post in Florida of someone experiencing what sounds like the same thing.  Interesting. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the witness may have been observing a twinkling star.
