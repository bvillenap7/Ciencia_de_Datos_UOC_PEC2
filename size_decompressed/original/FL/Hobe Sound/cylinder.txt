There was plenty of daylight.  The object was east of us coming toward us on a diagonal from the north east and then turned south paralleling the coast over the Atlantic Ocean.  It had NO wings or tail and not markings.  It had a blunted point on the southern end and a circular back end.  There was no combustion of any kind, noise or condensation trail. It moved out of sight in less than 20 seconds heading due south towards Miami.;27.0784733333333;-80.1537133333334
