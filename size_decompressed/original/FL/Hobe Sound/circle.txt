Very fast circular object with lights flashing in a circular pattern, it made no noise and was very low.;1999-08-15 21:00:00;10 secs;Very fast circular object with lights flashing in a circular pattern, it made no noise and was very low. Hello, I have been keeping this bottled up for many years but I now want to let it out.  In 1999 I lived in Hobe Sound Florida. One night I was taking my garbage out and as I walked out my door I looked up and saw an amazing site. A huge object was very low in the sky, moving east to west, at a tremendous speed but making no noise. There were many different colored lights all around it flashing in a circular pattern. I ran around my building to keep site of it and it was going so fast I could hardly see it within about 10 seconds. I have never seen anything move so fast but what really freaked me out was the fact there was no noise. I just saw the video on Yahoo about the UFO sightings in Stephenville, TX and the deer hunter made the statement about the object being fast and not making a sound.  I just wanted to get this off my chest. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));27.0784733333333;-80.1537133333334
Two White Star-like Shapes;2010-02-08 09:50:00;15 min.;Two White Star-like Shapes I woke up this morning and went down stairs for a cup of coffee and a cigarette.  When I went outside, I heard an airplane flying over head, and looked up to see it.  I then noticed a white balloon behind it.  This balloon did not keep up with the airplane, and moved SW very slowly. I then noticed it was heading for another white balloon in its path.  I went into my house to get my dad's pair of binoculars and went back outside.  I located them again, and when I looked through the binoculars I noticed a red/orange round shape between them.  I then realized that the two white balloons were actually reflecting the sunlight, and thought they looked more like stars. My mom came out on the porch and I pointed them out to her.  She had to go to work and that was at 10:05 am.  I had been watching them for fifteen minutes now, but after I said goodbye I looked back up and the one that was heading towards the other was now moving in the oppisite direction.  I followed it for a minute and then looked up at it without the binoculars and could not see it.  When I looked through the binoculars it was gone. I kept watching the sky, but the clouds rolled in and there was no chance of seeing it again.  I now there was a shuttle launch early this morning and that it was delivering a piece of the space station.  I was not going to think twice about it until I saw them move away from each other, and thought that was very strange.  I went to the NASA website to see the launch, and found that the red/orange object couldn't be the tank, because that falls off ten minutes in to the flight.  This took place six hours later..;27.0784733333333;-80.1537133333334
Orange obj. with fiery trail flying fast, in a straight line, S, along FL coastline, over Hobe Sound.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile.  PD));2013-01-30 20:49:00;<1 minute;Orange object with fiery trail flying fast, in a straight line, south, along FL coastline, over Hobe Sound, Jupiter Island area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness submits second report, reporting that the sighting had been caused by a missile launch out of Cape Canaveral.  PD)) Unidentified Object Over Stuart/Hobe Sound, Florida  While driving north on US Hwy 1 in Hobe Sound, Florida (just south of Stuart)on January 30th, 2013 - at approximately 8:49pm - a fast-moving, bright orange object caught my eye, to the east, over Jupiter Island. At first, I thought it was a plane, but noticed it looked too large to be airplane lights, and that it had a fiery / flaming orange trail. It was flying south, parallel to the coastline. My next thought was that it was possibly something that had been launched from Cape Canaveral, as we can occasionally see night-launches from our area. I had just driven from Jupiter/Tequesta, and had noticed a bright light (also in the east) possibly from a helicopter or airplane, about 8 miles south of where I saw the above-mentioned object. The reason I mention this, is because what initially caught my eye was the great speed of the orange flaming trail in relation to the light seen over the Jupiter/Tequesta area, less than 10 minutes prior. The sky was clear, with no clouds. I pulled over in a church parking lot (east side of US Hwy 1) to get a better look, and immediately dialed my husband from my cell phone. (8:50pm) I told him to look to the southeast. I asked if he could see it from our home in Stuart, just a few miles north and slightly west of where I had pulled over. He could not. He is a pilot, and thought I might have been seeing a jet-engine flaring. I did not think so, due to the fact it was moving so fast, and also, so straight. (Horizontally) After about 20-30 seconds, the trail was no longer visible, but I could still see a light (just a circular light)traveling straight and to the south, but much faster than it had been moving while the trail was visible. At this point I assumed it might be a meteorite or satellite, but thought it unlikely due to it's speed and how it did not lose altitude. The entire viewing lasted less than a minute. I watched the evening news at 11pm, thinking I would see a report of something unusual. Since I did not, I decided to research news online. Upon finding nothing, I chose to contact your agency via your telephone hotline, where I was advised to put it into writing,in my own words.;27.0784733333333;-80.1537133333334
UFO over Hobe Sound identified as NASA launch.;2013-01-30 20:49:00;<1 minute;UFO over Hobe Sound identified as NASA launch Re: Report I submitted detailing an unidentified object over Hobe Sound, FL on January 30th. I submitted a report early this morning (approx. 2 am), after witnessing an object with a glowing trail last night around 8:49pm. Just a few moments ago, I learned that it was actually a NASA launch from Cape Canaveral. While I'm sorry to have wasted your time, I am pleased that my first instincts were correct. Living near Cape Canaveral for so many years, I have witnessed many, many launches of satellites, rockets, and Space Shuttles. Thank you for your time and for providing a place to report such sightings.;27.0784733333333;-80.1537133333334
