No cars behind me or oncoming. I was going 60 mph and as I was driving I noticed in my rearview mirror the street lamp went out. Then it came back on. As I passed the next street light it also went off and came back on in about two or three seconds. Then out of the corner of my left eye I saw a green sphere going in a slight arc pattern above the tree line. It illuminated the top of the trees just slightly. As soon as it passed me to where I could see it through my windshield it just blinked out like a light bulb. I was listening to music and it just started to distort and my dashboard lights dimmed then went bright and my car stopped running. I was going 60 mph and I put it into neutral and coasted around a long curve in the road, with no lights power steering or brakes. As I got through the corner I slowly hit the brakes and pulled off the shoulder. I was  confused and shocked a bit I took a picture of my dashboard to send to my dad but I had no cell service. I turned the ignition off and pulled out the key and re started my car. As I got back to my neighborhood I re-sent the picture. My dad asked me what the picture was about and thats when I told him what happened and he wanted me to document this.;27.0784733333333;-80.1537133333334
