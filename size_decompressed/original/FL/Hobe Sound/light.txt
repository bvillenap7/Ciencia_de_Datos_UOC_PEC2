On the night of Christmas eve 11:59 pm 1 min till Christmas so me and my girlfriend went to her grandmas back porch to go sit outside and smoke, when we went out there we were sitting and eventually looking at the sky I saw a light twinkling like, it was bright shining light bigger then any star in the sky and it would flash on and off constantly, thats how i noticed it for at least 45 mins we were out there, and two or three times for a sec it would kind of just disappear maybe because clouds were blocking but then it would be right back.  After looking at it for so long it hurt my eyes but I saw like this force field of rainbow light emit like a force field around it for like 3 or 4 seconds then disappear but like in perfect shape around the light blue colored purple idk again it could of been my eyes playing tricks but the flashing of the bright light was clear to see.   But i asked around an people said the north star is bright.  IT DOESN'T BLINK LIKE A CHRISTMAS LIGHT DOES IT?;27.0784733333333;-80.1537133333334
