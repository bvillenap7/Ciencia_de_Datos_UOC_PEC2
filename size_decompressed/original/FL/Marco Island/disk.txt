7 rounds balls of light hovering in the sky.((NUFORC Note:  We believe they are reflections of ceiling lights.  PD))((anonymous report);2018-06-28 20:00:00;unknown;7 rounds balls of light hoovering in the sky I was on a dinner boat cruise on June 28th, 2018, on Marco Island in Florida.  I was actually just taking a picture of the storm clouds and noticed a couple weeks later these bright lighted disk shaped objects.  I enlarged the photo I took and was amazed at the 7 UFO's that were captured.  There is also a string of lights double row just below where the UFO's were flying.   The best way to show you is to forward my pictures and would be thrilled to submit to the address below. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe they are reflections of ceiling lights.
