White light (s) spiraling back and forth across the Gulf of Mexico.;2014-10-28 22:33:00;1 hour;white light (s) spiraling back and forth across the Gulf of Mexico I thought I saw a shooting star or lightning.

The light, which were flashes and illuminated by very light clouds (why I thought it was lightning) was darting and spiraling across vast distances appearing and reappearing. From the North to the West then back North East I haven't seen activity like this before. It seemed playful and carefree (?).;25.9334;-81.6895
