Boomerang shaped craft totally silent and at a high rate of speed.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from ex-military pilot.  PD));2010-09-21 23:00:00;7 seconds;Boomerang shaped craft totally silent and at a high rate of speed. While sitting on a patio overlooking the Gulf of Mexico looking up at the night sky, I noticed  the stars were being displaced from my right.  I could see the outline of a Boomerang shaped craft traveling at a high speed displacing the stars as it moved.  I could see that the shape was exactly like a Boomerang.  I could not tell what altitude it was at.  It made no sound at all but the bottom of it looked as if it had a heat signature of wavy lines on the underside.   I am an ex military fighter pilot, airline pilot and currently flying for a state agency.  There is no doubt in my mind what I saw was not any type of aircraft belonging to our military or civilian agency. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
