Hovering and disappearing lights over Marco Island;2013-08-23 23:45:00;10 minutes;Hovering and disappearing lights over Marco Island I saw two lights standing still close together in the sky above the ocean in marco island, florida.  A red circle and a yellow circle pretty close to each other.   As I turned around to tell the people that were with me and when I look back the red light was gone and the the yellow light started moving. I ran closer to the beach to get a closer look and once i got there they were gone!  While the lights were hovering in the sky the fire alarms on the hotel next door went off.  Not sure why but it caused police and fire rescue teams to arrive.;25.9334;-81.6895
