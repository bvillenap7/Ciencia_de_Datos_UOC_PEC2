Flying along coast. Flying slow.  They were spaced out.  Some were higher and some were lower.  Saw from grocery store parking lot.  Others in parking lot were taking pictures and a few people had pulled their cars over to look.  Maybe military but seemed to high to be helicopters and too slow for planes.  Not sure.  Wanted to see if anyone else had reported it.;25.9334;-81.6895
