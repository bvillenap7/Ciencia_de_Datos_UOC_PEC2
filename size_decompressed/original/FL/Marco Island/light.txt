I looked as though it were looking/following someth Myself and 2 friends were sitting on the balcony facing NW while noticing a light that hovered above the Gulf of Mexico and was changing colors.  ever so slightly in the gradation.  Turning white then blue then red then green. Pulsating. Thought maybe it was a boat except it was bouncing slightly then went backwards then forwards. Slowly. Boats don't have these lights, it was almost plasma like the way it changed. A white orb flashed once.  Like a signal...  The light that varied in color came from NW and continued South for about a half hour. Almost like it was looking down on something. Maybe following something. Since June 2014 I have witnessed several events that prompted my contacting you. I'm in such awe with knowing that what I am seeing isn't familiar I finally deem it worthy.;25.9334;-81.6895
