It was a grey colored single engined plane flying in the direction of Marco Airport from the sea side.   My attention was caught two objects in the sky behind the plane.  They were much higher up and over the sea to the north west of Marco (probably off the coast near Naples or Fort Myers).   They looked at first as if they were parachutes moving down towards the surface.  I realized that they could not be because they were too far out to sea and were very high up.  One appeared to be gray/black ant the other was a very bright light.  At first I thought the bright one was just the sun glinting off something.  I must have taken my eye off the for a second because then I saw both objects take off in a vertical direction out over the gulf at a high speed.  They were traveling in roughly a north west direction.  They appeared to stay the same distance apart with the black one a li! ttle lower and behind the bright one.  I watched them for several minutes as they disappeared into the distance.  It seemed like the light was unnaturally bright.
