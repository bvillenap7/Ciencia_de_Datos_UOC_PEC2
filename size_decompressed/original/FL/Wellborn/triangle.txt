I saw a light in the sky brighter than venus approaching my position from the south.  The sky was clear, light breeze temp 74 degrees.  The craft was moving very slowly to the north and passed directly overhead.  I estimate its size as large and at about 20K feet.  As it passed overhead I could make out the triangular shape. there were small lights at each point and a large bright light in the center.  There was no sound and no contrail and no strobe light. Passing overhead it changed course to the east.  Again no sound. I lost sight of it over Lake City.  I checked flightaware for air traffic and nothing was within miles of my position.  I had a strong flashlight with me (1500 luniins)  And attempted to signal it there was no response.  DAMN second time in three years.;30.182;-82.8445
