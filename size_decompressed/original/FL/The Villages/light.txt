unusual vision;2007-07-15 11:45:00;10 minutes;unusual vision I always go out on my lani before bed.  I like to watch the planes coming into a nearby airport and I watch the landing lights go on. I noticed an unusual looking plane, I thought, with just lights on the wingtips, no blinding lights or anything else.  It was moving along somewhat like a glider.  As it got closer a tree was blocking my vision so I stood up to watch when it passed the tree into my view again. At that point it slowly came down and towards me.  It stopped right in front of my lani screen.  I walked a few steps closer and it moved back a few feet.  It was a dark night and I could see nothing but the two lights on each side, at that point about 4 feet apart.  No beams at all, something like a two flashlights and the batteries getting low. I stepped back and it again moved up to the lanai screen. At that point, I was frightened, went into my house and closed the sliding glass doors and blinds.  Nothing further happened and please send me some feedback. What did I see?;28.9306421052631;-81.9854368421053
Definite ufo sighting, repeatable/observable.;2011-12-25 23:50:00;For the past week, happen;Definite ufo sighting, repeatable/observable. For the past week ufo's have been flying directly over my home. My friend and I thought they were stars at first, but then theyv started moving erratically. They move in one direction then back and the opposite direction and sometimes make a spiraling motion on the horizontal axis. They are there when night falls and they are there all night long.  Two nights ago I, my friend and his mother were observing the ufo's when I noticed a light blink on on the horizon. Upon closer inspection we saw that it was a small clam-shell shaped silver craft that we assumed to be an unmanned drone of some type.  These craft have the ability to maintain a spatial position within the atmosphere (hover) they can move front to back, side to side, in zig-zags, in short they appear to have total and complete control over spatial movement within our atmosphere.  We do not have the resources ourselves to properly investigate this phenomenon but we would love to know what these craft are and encourage others to observe the night sky for stars that appear to be wiggling or moving in short straight lines and document everything you can.  In the meantime we will seek HD cameras and telescopes to investigate this phenomenon and we will share what we find.;28.9306421052631;-81.9854368421053
Red lights-Villages, FL;2014-04-06 23:00:00;3-5 minutes;Red lights-Villages, FL Looking down the hill toward N/W of Villages, there were around 15 red lights being launched into the sky - it reminded us of fireworks being launched.  But these red lights stayed still, moved a little, then went straight up behind cloud cover.   Strange pattern, after they were launched, they stayed still then moved up into the clouds.   All 15 lights followed the same pattern - and there was no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));28.9306421052631;-81.9854368421053
3 orange lights.;2014-06-19 10:00:00;3 minutes;3 orange lights. seemed like they were launched into the Western sky.   First one, with glowing orange lights (no sound) it moved a little to the right then started to move straight up into the sky.   Then the second one appeared, then the third.   They were all moving very slowly - straight up.   Then they disappeared one by one in the order they appeared.   I'm not sure if there are any US bases located here in mid-florida.   This is actually the second time I've seen this.  The first time was in April 2014 and there were about 20 lights, all behaving the same way.

Happened to look up at stars, and saw 6 small, light yellow lights, in 2 formations of 3 lights each moving across sky at a low altitude.  All were moving the same speed without any noise to be heard.  Heading in Eastern direction.  They disappeared one at a time.   Two nights later the TV news showed the same light's, formation, and speed traveling by a rocket at Cape Canaveral.  No one knew what they were?
