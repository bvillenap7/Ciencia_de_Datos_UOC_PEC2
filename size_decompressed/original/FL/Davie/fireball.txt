Two bright star like objects;2008-12-02 19:15:00;2 minutes;My husband, two children and I were driving West on 595 on December 2nd at 7:15 when we saw two bright star like objects in the sky ahead of us.  I was paying attention to the sky at that moment because I was admiring Venus and another planet.  My husband and I noticed as the objects got closer to us that the lights were definitely not an airplane or helicopter. The lights were apart but moved together and then after they passed us became perpendicular to one another.  I watched them until we got off the 136th street exit and then they were out of sight.;26.0654;-80.2339
Three dark orange or reddish colored objects flying in a triangular pattern over Davie;2009-01-03 21:25:00;less than a minute;Three dark orange or reddish colored objects flying in a triangular pattern over Davie I was traveling North down 136th avenue passing Western High School with my girlfriend and 2 friends when we noticed three dark orange or reddish colored objects flying in a triangular pattern above what I believe would have been the front portion of Shenandoah. I turned down Appalachian trail and noted that the objects were not still standing but were moving in a South West direction towards Weston, FL.  At first the objects looked to be a one object with a light in each corner of the triangle, but suddenly they began to move irregularly and one jetted away, this left two. I viewed this event for under a minute and viewed the last two until they were no longer visable over the houses, they were moving at a fast but steady pace due Southwest. These lights were contained they didnt emit any stream or glare but were very deep in color and bright at the same time.;26.0654;-80.2339
Saw four round yellow/amber fire balls in the western sky in Davie Florida.;2012-12-09 20:00:00;10-15 minutes;saw four round yellow/amber fire balls in the western sky in Davie Florida. On the evening of Sunday 12/09/2012 myself and a friend were taking a walk at approximately the 20:00 hour.  In the western sky traveling from south to north we noticed 3 yellow amber round lights in the sky, at a height that was a little higher than where a helicopter flies.  They were spread apart at a distance of approximately 300 yards.   A little later during our walk we noticed another one by itself.  We were able to capture it on video and have photos as well. Came across a similar sighting on the internet that took place the same night in San Francisco,  http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2012/12/10/unexplained-light-formation-spotted-above-sf-mission/. Please let me know if you need any additional info or would like to see a picture or the video.;26.0654;-80.2339

As it passed overhead, there was no sound at all.  It looked like a butterfly shape, flickering brightly with an orange light, that only showed as a spot of light on my cameras.   As it passed overhead, another appeared from the same location.  They continued moving northeast, traveling from the direction of Key West toward Bermuda.  We saw five, then a gap, then 8 or 9 more appeared, one by one, flying the same general path, although not exactly.   We saw one go by as an airplane from Ft Lauderdale airport passed overhead.   As a retired military pilot and current commercial pilot, I have not seen anything like this in 37 years of flying.;26.0654;-80.2339
Unidentified multiple fireball crafts that were too close for comfort.;2014-02-28 20:24:00;4;Unidentified multiple fireball crafts that were too close for comfort. Walking around our block and noticed 3 aircrafts initially.  They looked bright red orange and were pretty big.  They were not airplanes or helicopters.   At first they were stationary then they started to move in a trianular pattern.  Behind it to the right there were several more.  They appeared very close.   I panicked and ran to get into my house with my toddler.  My husband watched them and said they went straight up and faded out.   Does anyone know if this is a US Military Project?  It is too scary to think otherwise.   I thought I could handle extraterrestrial contact but apparently I cannot.  I was too scared and was immediately panicked about the safety of my children.;26.0654;-80.2339
Suspicious reds lights in the sky.;2014-08-21 22:15:00;5 minutes;Suspicious reds lights in the sky It was Thursday August 21, 2014, and I had just started watching the ten o'clock news when my daughter came into my room and told me to look out the window.  I asked her, What is it?'.   She raised her voice at me and told me to quickly run to the window.  Concerned by her actions I looked out the window.  I saw about 5 to six redish lights flying by in a coordinated arched sequence.   At first I thought they might be airplanes or helicopters because we live close to Ft. Lauderdale airport but then they broke their flight pattern and flew around in a way that airplanes nor helicopters could.   All of a sudden they flashed and then their lights turned off and they disappeared except for one.  The one left behind hovered in a slow circular motion then slowly went down by a nearby highway (I-595) behind the trees.   I was a bit alarmed that it came down.  I contacted a few neighbors to see if anyone else saw the same but they didn't.  As all this happened, there wer! e other planes in the area, someone else has to have seen this.  Either a pilot, passenger or even drivers on the nearby highway must have seen something.  I needed to report it in case someone else did see the lights in the sky.  It happened between 10 and 10:30pm in Davie, Florida.;26.0654;-80.2339
