Saw lights in sky moving east very fast, did not match planes near by;2007-08-27 21:40:00;60 sec;Saw lights in sky moving east very fast, did not match planes near by On August 27th, 2007 I was taking out the trash and looked up towards the full moon. I looked south east of the moon and thought I saw a shooting star.  It flew up over the hight of the moon around 9:45 pm with a white trail behind it, not unlike when a plane is very high and you see that white trail,  but it was much shorter.  I could only see flicking colored lights in the front of the trail.  It shot over the moon and was traveling north east more east towards the beach. It flew very high in the sky but you could see the colored lights then it disapeared.  I watched other planes in the area for the next 1/2 hour and the lights were different and the regular planes moved much slower then the thing I observed  The whole thing lasted less then 60 seconds.  It really freaked me out.  Did anyone else see what I saw in Broward County, Florida;26.0654;-80.2339
Lights over Davie Florida;2008-08-04 22:55:00;5 minutes;Lights over Davie Florida I was driving home at around 10:55 pm and I saw 7-10 amber colored lights in the sky over in the Flamingo Rd and 595 area. They were in a diagonal line and I thought they were way too low to be airplanes, and nothing was blinking either.  They seemed to be hovering in place.  I drove home to get my family and we went back out there, but by the time we got back (10 minutes), they was nothing there.  Over the next week, I talked to 2 more people that saw the same thing on the same night.;26.0654;-80.2339
Fireball in the sky that dissipated after a few minutes.;2013-10-28 22:00:00;5 minutes;Fireball in the sky that dissipated after a few minutes I saw a fireball in the sky last night while out with my boyfriend (so he saw it too)  It was quite clearly not a plane, or anything even closely resembling a plane.  It acted as though it was literally on fire... and after 5 minutes, it dissipated slowly, as though it were dimming.   There was no notable sound, although, it was quite a distance away from us anyway.;26.0654;-80.2339
Quiet craft, very fast, large vertical shadow, 4:00 in march around Davie, FL.;2014-03-19 16:00:00;1 minute;Quiet craft, very fast, large vertical shadow, 4:00 in march around Davie Fl I was walking my dog after school around 4:00 p.m and a few of my neighbors were outside.   As I came close to my house my dog sat down and I noticed that the sound around me vacuumed, it felt like my ears were popping.   My dog looked up into the sky and then I saw a large vertical shadow go across my street quickly, there was silence the whole time.  When I looked up I didn't see much except for the clouds being pulled in the same direction as the shadow.   The sounds returned to normal after the shadow made its way up the street.  The date is approximate, I don't remember exactly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));26.0654;-80.2339
Brilliant light coming and going, and loud, increasing, engine noise stops suddenly!  ((anonymous report));2017-07-08 03:11:00;5 seconds;Brilliant light coming and going and loud  increasing engine noise stops Suddenly! Our dogs were uncomfortable and excited while we were sleeping.  I woke up because of the barking. When I head the back yard I heard a noise like an aircraft engine that increased like acceleration and simultaneously saw a brite white light moving in the back of the building. The engine noise got louder and all of a sudden it stops!  My daughter could see the light coming thru her bedroom illuminating the whole room in an angle of less than 45 degrees. The light and the noise were moving  in direction WEST-EAST. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of the report elects to remain anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));26.0654;-80.2339
