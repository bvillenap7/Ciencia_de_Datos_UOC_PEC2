The object was a bright flash of blue green light.  After the initial flash, the light intensity increased so that the immediate area of the sky was filled with the blue green color.  The duration was short (1 second), but the intensity was so great that the interior of my car was filled with the blue green color.  The flash was observed while I was driving on Flamingo road, somewhat near the Florida everglades, at 22:43.  The object appeared to my West, and was probably over the Florida everglades.  I am an 18 year old student at the University of Florida.  I am studying microbiology to become a medical doctor.  I have never before witnessed a UFO.;26.0654;-80.2339
