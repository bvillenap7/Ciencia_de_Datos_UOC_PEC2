Ultra-Bright White Blimp like Object.  ((anonymous report));2016-12-15 20:00:00;5 minutes;Ultra-Bright White Blimp like Object REPORT UFO Sighting Davie, FL 12/15/2016 20:00  I first spotted the light in the northern sky.  Location of the full moon was in the northern sky as well.  The moon was at about 45DEG.  It was difficult to see at first because it was directly behind, but a little above a streetlight. I would say the object was approximately 15DEG above the horizon.   The object was moving westward slowly, effortlessly, and quietly.  It was blimp like in movement and shape. I lost vision of it behind a large tree.  The object then looped to the south and was directly in front of me at 26 5’ 40.66N 80 15’32.45W  At this point the object was almost stationary.  It was ultra-bright white.  So bright my eyes had a hard time focusing.  However, I did notice that there was a square to rectangular shaped area on the bottom that was black.  Hand drawn picture will be sent to email referenced on website.  In addition, the object was equal to the horizon and less than 1/4 (.25) miles from my observation location east of coordinates. Object began an accelerate movement to the SSW where it crossed a major commercial airline flight path.  I believe an inbound commercial airliner made an abrupt turn and deceleration. I searched the internet for pictures of blimp at night, and the object had no resemblance of the pictures I viewed.  I thought if it was a blimp heading south it would be going to Perry Airport.  I got in my vehicle and drove in that direction.  I spotted the object again, in the distance.  I drove all the way to Perry Airport, but did not see the object in the area.
