At first I thought there must be traffic at the nearby airport but then noticed that some of the lights were close together. Some were clustered and some were apart.  They were travelling slowly towards the south.   The lights were orange and they were circular.  They were low enough that I could recognize that they were not planes or helicopters but too high to make out exactly what it was. ((ADDENDUM FROM ORIGINAL WITNESS)) Hi I called and made an online report yesterday about 20 orange lights.   I am being told that these may have actually been lanterns from a memorial service being held.

100 orange orbs traveling slowly and silently southbound, then fading out in Davie, Florida 12-1-11 18:10 Hrs.;2011-12-01 18:10:00;10 minutes;100 orange orbs traveling slowly and silently southbound, then fading out in Davie, Florida 12-1-11 18:10 Hrs. I was pulling into my apartment complex and noticed a few orange orbs traveling south over the complex.  My wife and I parked, got out of the vehicle and walked out to the west end of the complex where we could get a better view of the sky.  We saw a trail of orange orbs (approximately 100) slowly and silently traveling south from the area of Interstate 595.   When each one reached the area approximately one mile south of I-595 their light would just fade out. There wasn't a cloud in the sky. They appeared to be at the altitude of a low flying plane or helicopter.  This area is west of the FLL airport.  I did not observe any other aircraft in their immediate vicinity, or any law enforcement presence on the ground.

One on my Many Federal jobs is to monitor ATC approach control for FLL.  This is at 120.7 MHZ (AM).  In case a plane crashes or something. So (of course), at 9: 10 PM, a fleet of a dozen or more Orange UFO's decided to fly into their IFR landing approach pattern for runway 9-L!   The pilots and the tower were going nuts ! Um, the UFO's were at about 3,000 feet at 350 knots.  Headed northwest. About 2 miles away.;26.0654;-80.2339

It appeared to be traveling in a straight line, but then stopped moving, and changed direction.  It stopped several times, and moved erratically. I also saw some flashing white lights, but mostly a steady red light. I watched it change direction several times, before it switched from mostly North to South, and traveled rapidly towards Miami, where I lost sight of it.;26.0654;-80.2339
