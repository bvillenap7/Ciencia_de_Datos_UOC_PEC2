I looked straight up and saw 2 bright white lights which seemed to be connected by a thin white line (a dumbbell shape) moving steadily in a straight line for several seconds over me and then vanished, just disappeared instantly.  Object made no sound.;26.0654;-80.2339
Silent, translucent Y shaped object just above tree level, steady course with slow climb, approx 10mph;2010-05-04 22:30:00;10 minutes;Silent, translucent Y shaped object just above tree level, steady course with slow climb, approx 10mph Was jogging on the road, warehouse district where my business is located.  Clear skies, no rain, miminal wind if any (slight wind from the East just slightly moving tree-tops along road that were maybe 50 feet high)   Object at first thought was a plastic bag floating along at just above tree level (50-60 feet AGL).   I hold commercial rotorcraft rating. Estimate size at around 5-6 feet long with individual legs of the Y tubular structure approximately 5 inches in diameter.   Width of two Y appendages approximately 4-5 inches diameter with the legs approximately 2/3rds the length of the base leg. Bag like object was Y shaped, tubular and transluscent.  No form of light emitted, no actual color other than translucent like plastic bag. Realized was not plastic bag because course of movement was steady, no wavering.  Object crossed in front of my running path, then yawed 180 degrees as if to face me from the original side facing me as it crossed from my right to my left. Attempted to follow the object but it slowly began to climb and to move slightly faster, probably around 10 mph.  I could not catch it running as fast as possible and I run 8 plus miles several times weekly. Object remained on steady course of 270, westbound and climbed slowly.  I ran out of running room after around 200 yards.  The object continued to climb and move Westward until it was out of sight. Object was dead silent.  Was definitely NOT plastic bag as shape was maintained and absolutely NO wavering in it course and no floppy movement of it appendages as you would expect a plastic bag floating along to do.

It was low and seem even low for a blimp.  Didn't think much because it is on plane descent into airport.  But my 4 kids started to notice so I kept trying to determine what it was.  Googled image of blimps at night and nothing.  There was no noises and it was no movement one place.  The area has countless blimps/planes etc.  This was just different.  I pulled in to Publix parking, only to find it wasn't there.  In a matter of turning right into parking lot than right into parking space and it was gone.;26.0654;-80.2339
