UFOS OVER DAVIE FLA.;2009-01-02 21:22:00;5 min;UFOS OVER DAVIE FLA. I was watching the Utah bowl game, when my daughter called and asked me too look out back in the sky and see what the lights were, it was five lights moving westward, three of them in a perfect line and two a little distance behind them, both separated, no noise what so ever, a lot of people had to see them from the 595 highway, what is surprising is this is the same flight pattern area that commercial plans use to  U turn thru to head back to FTL airport, I would think it would be imposable for the flight tower NOT to see them, I did take pictures with my cell phone, they were very close. I did ask a few police stations by phone if they had heard anything, they had no calls or any reports, I'm sure glad other people have reported it, nobody believes us.

South West Broward FL Orange Redish Lights Flyby on 8/28/2010 20:45;2010-08-28 20:45:00;15 Minutes;South West Broward FL Orange Redish Lights Flyby on 8/28/2010 20:45 I live near the flight path of where airplanes approach to land at Ft. Lauderdale international airport.  On a clear night if I look west I can see an aircraft approaching maybe out 30 miles or more.  As the aircraft proceeds to land I can see it all the way until about it reaches the airport approximately 15 miles east.  On ordinary nights I see several dozen planes go through.  I've lived at this location for the last 10 years and I know the types of lights airplanes have.  Typically they have bright almost white lights for landing, and typically a blue, read or white flashing lights.   On this August night, it was about 830 PM and I just got home from work.  I live near I-75 and the Griffen Road exit in Broward county FL.  The conditions were partly cloudy with a very distant thunderstorm South East of my location approximately 25 or more miles in the area of North Miami Beach. I was on the phone when I noticed two bright light orange redish lights flying! sided by side approximately 10 miles south of my location.  The were flying at what appeared to be low speeds and in the midst of low level clouds.   The lights appeared to be bigger than what you would expect from lights shinning on an airplane at that distance.  They flew for maybe 1 minute heading west and then turned together toward the south. The light was directional for one of the objects and was not for the other.  In other words, as one of the objects turned south, its light turned with it.  The other object seemed to turn the light after it had turned south. They repeated the same flyby another 3 times.  The lights seemed to dim and then brighten as they flew by.  When the lights turned south there were no flashing strobe lights to indicate it was an airplane. My parents witnessed the lights from their car just south of my location less than a quarter mile away. I confirmed they saw and object with orange redish lights and they thought it was an airplane at first! , but my dad noticed there were no recognizable lights that a ! typical airplane would carry.  Still can't explain what it was, but would love to know if anyone else in the South West Broward area saw lights at the same time I did.;26.0654;-80.2339

Seven flying lights turned south and climbed into clouds.;2014-02-08 19:50:00;3 minutes;Seven flying lights turned south and climbed into clouds. Seven flying lights appeared to be over Davie/I595 coming from west.  Flying slightly above FLL approach path. Slowly turned south between Hiatus Road and Nob Hill Road then began ascent. Eventually disappearred into clouds as they each ascended. Some lingered longer than others. Never made a sound. No red or green lights.  Light was orangish. Sortly after a normal aircraft was seen on FLL approach and difference in color, shape, and behavior was very obvious.  Aircraft engines were heard when the obvious aircraft came into sight.  Never a sound when it was only the seven lights!  Have iPhone video, but through screening.  Too shocked to think to go outside of screening.;26.0654;-80.2339
Amber lights over I-75...definitely not an aircraft on approach.;2014-03-15 23:00:00;60 seconds;Amber lights over I-75...definitely not an aircraft on approach. My wife and I were returning home from dinner after briefly stopping at the gas station down the block from my home at approximately 11pm EST.  After leaving the gas station, as we were crossing the overpass that runs over I-75 (State Road 84 between Weston Road and 148th Ave.)  I looked to the right and in the sky I saw 5 (or 6 not sure now) orange/amber colored lights floating in the air.  They weren't low enough to make out a definite shape. I've always been a star gazer so I'm very familiar with the skies around my home.  I live on the approach path to Fort Lauderdale International Airport and I've been travelling on airplanes for work for the last 15 years.  I can confidently say I know what airplanes look like on approach and the light configurations you'll see from the ground. What struck me about this sighting were a few things... 1.	  They were not moving towards the airport.  When I first spotted them they seemed to be stationary, but as I changed direction on the road on my way home I realized they were actually moving towards the north.  My original perspective was north of them, so they appeared to not be moving for the few moments I was at that perspective. 2.	  They were only one color, orange/amber.  I have 16/20 vision and I didn't see any other colors.  I can always see the red flashing lights on airplanes whether on approach or very high in the sky. 3.	These objects were definitely within our atmosphere.  I could see stars behind them and they appeared, as usual, far away.  These appeared to be no more than 10,000 feet in the air. 4.	I assumed they weren't military craft because they weren't flying in formation.  There was a lack of night time lights, like commercial craft, and there was a definite lack of a jet engine sound. All of the objects were basically in a straight line from the northern perspective.  I've attempted to create a diagram below using numbers 1-5 to represent each object from left to right.  In case the diagram doesn't copy well.  Objects 1, 2 and 5 were basically in a straight line, although 5 seemed to be a degree or two  higher than 1 and 2.  Object 3 was directly below 2, and object 4 was slightly lower than 2 and 5 (think Orion's belt). -1-                                                    -2-                                                                                                  -5- 								-4-   			              -3-	   When my perspective changed to a westerly direction, they were all moving to the north (right).  Please remember I was the passenger in a moving vehicle on a S curve.  So my westerly perspective changed to a curving southern direction after about 5 seconds of moving west.  It was obviously difficult to properly assess the speed of all objects simultaneously due to their distance from each other.  I was concentrating mostly on objects 1-3, since object 5 was already almost out of site to the north.  Objects 4 and 5 appeared to be moving at the same speed.  Object 2 was accelerating faster than 4 and 5, 3 was barely moving and 1 was moving slowly or had just started to accelerate.  I would say object 2 was moving the fastest, but it's really difficult to compare it anything.  Was it moving faster than a plane at that altitude?  I can't say because there was no point of reference but the stars and one other plane on approach to FLL. And because of the plane I can definitely say it wasn't a commercial plane.  The color of the objects appeared to be the same color as HID street lamps.  That orange glow you get from High Pressure Sodium bulbs. If this sighting sounds like something worth investigating I would be willing to draw a diagram.  The event is clear in mind and I doubt will diminish for quite some time.  It was definitely out of the ordinary and unexplainable from my experiences to-date.;26.0654;-80.2339
Orange glow - 'twinkling occasionally';2014-12-25 21:15:00;5 minutes;Orange glow - 'twinkling occasionally' 5 orange moving lights separated by same distance moving southwest crossing into west flight plan for planes landing at Fort Lauderdale.   One light was near a plane preparing to land but the proximity of height was unknown as well as the height of the plane.  The landing plane appeared to circle further out towards the south while landing east.   No noise emanating from the lights.  Twinkling coming from light.   Moving below clouds.

Backyard UFO Fleet night sky sighting!  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-30 09:17:00;3 minutes;Backyard UFO Fleet night sky sighting! Ok so tonight It is half moon with clear sky and many visible stars there was a straight line of about 100 starlike lights moving  They were in a straight line they looked like regular white stars just moving in a line within the same distance of each other ... not like a shooting star or a comet it looked like airplanes moving.  we were in our backyard which faces west and the lights were coming from the north toward the west but up to the sky toward the moon if that makes sense  U can tell they were very far up because they were tiny from where we were and as soon as they were within the moons moonlight range each one one by one disappeared.... just like that  There were about 100 just flying upward evenly spaced and in the same straight in sync line and disappearing one at a time ... and in the middle of it there was one of the stars coupled with another one as if a double-fleet.  Then at the end when the group of stars or ufos were finishing the final about 5-8 were just riding without having any synchronization or they were just going at their own pace.  This lasted for three minutes.;26.0654;-80.2339
