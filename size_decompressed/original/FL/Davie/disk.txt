Lauderdale-saucer shape-light on top pulsing- 5/24/06 The object which appeared to be saucer shaped with a bright light on top and a darkness underneath was situated a few thousand feet above the earth stationary. The light on top obliterated the true shape of the craft wnw from the town of Davie. It appeared top be watching the fireworks and left before they ended. I noticed the craft when I looked outside to see the fireworks and wondered what it was. I had never seen a craft in the air that was stationary for so long It was about 15 degrees north of where the airliners come in for a landing to Ft. Lauderdale airport. I checked every half hour or so to see it sitting in the air at exactly the same place. When the fireworks slowed down, I looked and it was gone. I did not see it leave.;26.0654;-80.2339
Amber Disk Sighted near Ft. Lauderdale International Airport.;2014-03-01 21:10:00;4 minutes;Amber Disk Sighted near Ft. Lauderdale International Airport I witnessed a reddish/amber object approaching from the NE. It was about 7,000 feet in altitude and moving at about 200 knots.  It was about 30 feet in diameter. Near the approach path to runway 9 Left, it dimmed its illumination and went dark. I got my 7 X 50 mm binoculars real quick and noticed he object was still there!  It was somewhat reflective of the ambient city lights below. Just at due east of my balcony location, it jogged around very quickly in the sky for about 10 seconds.  Only moving about 4 diameters in distance relative to its size.  Yes, the stars were steady.   The object was moving during this time. Then it proceeded to continue on its flight path towards the SW.;26.0654;-80.2339
