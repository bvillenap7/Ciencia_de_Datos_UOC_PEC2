Week before last, I was driving through Northern Florida, to Pensacola, on I10. I see this weird metallic object just sitting in the sky. The more I watched it, I realized it didn't have wings. And it wasn't moving. At all. The thing was literally just sitting in the air. I was telling my mom, over the phone, this was the freakiest thing I've ever seen, and trying to explain how it looked when it suddenly started moving. It didn't accelerate fast like most ufo videos show, but instead just kind of putt-putted across the sky. I couldn't watch it the entire time because I was driving on the interstate. I took my eyes off of it for a couple seconds but when I looked back, it was gone. I can only describe this thing as looking completely metallic, with a sort of oblong body and honestly I'd most closely relate it to a train car. I know that sounds stupid but that's the closest similarity I can think of. The area I was driving from does see regular activity regarding military helicopter fly-overs - it's a pretty secluded small town. But this was not a helicopter, there were no propellers. No anything, it was just sitting there, perfectly still like it was painted onto the sky.;30.7411;-86.7186
