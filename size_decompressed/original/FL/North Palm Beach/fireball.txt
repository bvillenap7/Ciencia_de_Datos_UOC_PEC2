My wife called me to the back yard to look at orange-red ball shaped bright lights moving south bound.;2012-11-21 21:15:00;10 minutes;Wednesday 11/21/12  9:15 pm my wife called me to the back yard to look at orange-red  ball shaped bright lights moving south bound over the atlantic coast line. They appeared to be at an altitude  of 3000 to 5000 feet (a guess based on my experience as a private pilot) moving at a speed of 200 to 400 mph.  my first thought was a rocket from the cape, but the direction was wrong and shape was round.  The first group of two linear arranged, the next group of 3 approx 4 min. later were in a staggered vertical alignment, at a higher altitude.  Approx. 2 min. later a single fireball passed.  No idea what I witnessed.;26.8286;-80.0587
2 large fireballs traveling SE to NW.;2013-12-22 21:05:00;2 minutes;2 large fireballs traveling SE to NW Two fireballs traveling from SE to NW-second fireball approx 30-45 seconds behind first fireball.  Appeared to be following close to exact path as first fireball.   Watched first one and then second one travel NW until they faded from sight.   While traveling, they both appeared to be flaming in and out in intensity.   Thought it might be something with recent ISS problems and spacewalk.;26.8286;-80.0587
4 fireballs over night sky!;2020-08-29 19:46:00;2 minutes;4 fireballs over night sky! We saw 4 fire type balls in the air right after sunset. I looked at my friend and said, “Do you see that?” We tried to videotape it but they were moving around too much.  We were south of the fireballs and they were in the north east corner of the sky. They were like fire balls that were changing shape as well as changing to different tones of the fireball as they moved up and down and side to side very quickly.  One would disappear and then come back in another area and then come back with the other fireballs. They clearly were not drones!  All I can say is that they looked like fire balls that moved around sharply and randomly and we could tell they were all working together.;26.8286;-80.0587
