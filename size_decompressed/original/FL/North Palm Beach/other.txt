I got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and a bright light was shining from the sky into my eighth floor apartment.  The light was so different from anything I have ever seen that I went onto our balcony and using binoculars observed it.  I then woke up my husband and each of us noticed that there were two strange lights in the sky, one very big and a smaller one to the right.  My husband called the police and the officer viewed the lights from our balcony.  He told me to write to you. All of us thought it was very unusual.  The officer left and I continued watching with wonder.  The next evening, I got up around the same time and saw the lights again.  This time I took photos.
