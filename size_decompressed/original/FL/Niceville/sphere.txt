Orange sphere traveling north west from the Gulf of Mexico, just above the horizon silent, level flight path.;2017-08-05 21:10:00;3 minutes;Orange sphere traveling north west from the Gulf of Mexico just above the horizon silent, level flight path I was outside on the phone with my father, and I turned towards my house. I noticed the object, an orange sphere, moving north east from the Gulf of Mexico, just above tree top height from my location.  There was no sound.  There were no anti-collision lights visible as would appear on man made aircraft.   I was to the left of the object, and the light was a steady brightness as it traveled.  It was too slow and to be a shooting star, and left no visible trail as an object entering the atmosphere would do. Now, the area around here is Eglin AFB Reservation, and I've seen helicopters, MV-22 Ospreys, C-130s, and various commercial aircraft at various times at night, and this wasn't any of those.  It wasn't a parachute flare, as it was moving horizontally, and maintained a level flight path. My background is military.  Former Marine, worked on AV-8B Harriers for a decade.  I'm very familiar with how aircraft look at night, and what they sound like at various distances.;30.515;-86.4843999999999
