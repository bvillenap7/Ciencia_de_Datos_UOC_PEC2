Diamond shaped object over Niceville Marina in Florida....;2011-05-22 14:00:00;2-3 minutes;Diamond shaped object over Niceville Marina in Florida.... I am so wigging out as I type this.  I have this on Camera...the craft was not visible to anyone with the naked eye.  It only showed up on my IPhone. I will be trying to contact the Media to get these pics out on TV. This happened yesterday in Niceville, Florida, while dining with a group of friends at a Marina....NOBODY saw or noticed any sound.   Again, it showed up CLEAR AS DAY in TWO pics taken 1 to 2 minutes apart in different angles!!! ((NUFORC Note:  This report originally was posted for a sighting location in Niceville, Delaware.  Upon further consideration, we realize that the location must be in Okaloosa County, Florida, and we have changed the state to that state.  PD));30.515;-86.4843999999999
