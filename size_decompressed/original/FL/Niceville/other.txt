Was chunky shaped much like a witch on a broomstick almost.  There were smaller black dots circled above that I thought were birds, but they chased and then attached to the large object.  Only saw this for a few seconds and then lost sight as I drove through shaded areas of the street.  Never saw again.  Looked for days in local papers and online to see if any other reports. nothing.
