Line of 60+ lights traveling in perfect formation across sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-12-14 06:00:00;10 minutes+;Line of 60+ lights traveling in perfect formation across sky I went out Saturday morning around 6:00 AM to see if there were any more meteors as it was too cloudy on Friday night to see them. I was looking straight up in the sky and noticed a line of lights lined up in a straight line and at a perfect distance apart. They were traveling from the NW to the SE. I ran in and told my Husband that he had to come and see what is in the sky. He looked up and stated,”Where?” I am pointing, there! He finally sees the line of lights too. There was an airplane traveling under them because you could see the plane’s flashing lights. The lights were too far up for my IPhone to capture the video. The line of lights kept moving across the sky then a second set of lights started just West of the first line, then just like the fist line, all in perfect formation. They were all one size. They didn’t twinkle like a star or have any type of beaming or flashing lights or halos. Simply put, they were the light. If you look up at a furthest ! star that is still easily visible to the naked eye then this is about the distance that it was from Earth. I counted at least 60+ and there where at least 8-9, maybe more that you could see all at the same time. Approximately around 6:10 AM there was a last one in line and I watched it until it disappeared.;27.3657;-82.1882999999999
