Round ball of light turns and heads out to sea. Indian Rocks Beach, FL.;2013-09-20 22:00:00;10 seconds;Round ball of light turns and heads out to sea. Indian Rocks Beach, FL I was sitting on the beach facing west and saw a ufo. It was a bright round white light with yellow and red mixed in. It had no navigational lights on it. It was about the size of a small 2 person airplane. It was a little less than a half mile away, made no sound and seemed to appear out of nowhere.  It was about 550 feet high and was flying toward me turned and in a couple of seconds flew out to sea ascending and was gone.  I saw the lights all dim and then could barely make out the shape as it flew away at an alarming rate.;27.8896;-82.8409
