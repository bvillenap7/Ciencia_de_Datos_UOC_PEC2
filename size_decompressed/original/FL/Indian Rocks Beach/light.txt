One (myself) and a neighbor laying on a picnic table, just staring at the stars directly adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico noticed a, what appeared to be another larger star, far out towards the horizon, started zig zagging through the star constellations, until it stopped directly above us, held that spot for a moment, then abruptly went off the side of the night sky at a 45 degree angle in less than 1 second!!!  The whole event was no longer than 6-8 seconds!!  I KNOW THEY ARE OUT THERE !!!;27.8896;-82.8409

Indian Rocks Beach FL - Amazing light in the sky over the ocean flies abnormally and disappears into thin air!;2014-06-25 00:50:00;2:00;Indian Rocks Beach FL - Amazing light in the sky over the ocean flies abnormally and disappears into thin air! I was sitting on the beach it was after midnight.  I go to the beach at night a lot. I saw a white and yellow light looking west out over the ocean maybe a half mile out.  It was clear over the water the object was soundless and 300 ft in air flew towards me and then south then it quickly changed directions and zig zagged rapidly.  Then it flew slowly towards the north at about 20 mph then cut in towards the shore.  When it was over the first condo on the beach I thought to it, why are you not cloked they will see you?  I swear right after I thought that it disappeared into thin air.  There was no solid red or green lights on the object.;27.8896;-82.8409
Two flashing lights seen over Indian Rocks Beach, Florida.;2015-08-19 20:50:00;~ 1 minute;Two flashing lights seen over Indian Rocks Beach, Florida. I was outside my house sitting on the porch at night, when I noticed a red-and-white flashing light flying from left to right in the sky.  At first I thought it was an airplane with the landing lights on (hence the flashing red and white lights), but then I noticed that the pauses in between the flashes were unusually long, and there was no illumination of the object in between the flashes (this was different then all of the other aircraft I have seen before).  After realizing this, I turned on my iPod Touch to try to take a video of the object. My sighting of the first object lasted for about 45 seconds  Interestingly, several seconds after the first object was blocked by the palm tree, I spotted a second object traveling in the opposite direction, with the same flashing light and approximate size as the first object. The second object traveled from right to left, for about 30 seconds, until it appeared to slow down slightly, decrease in altitude for a few seconds, and then disappear (most likely behind a cloud). Including the time in between my observation of the two objects, the entire sighting lasted about 1 minute and 30 seconds.  I would like to note that while there were other aircraft in the vicinity of the UFOs, I was not able to estimate how far away they were (as I did not know how far away the UFOs were, or how big the UFOs were).  Note for investigator: Look in the accompanying e-mails for screenshots from the video, as well as the original video.;27.8896;-82.8409

Too high for a drone and longer than a drone would last. Seen hovering over the gulf in spurts and then eventually took off in a quick motion.;27.8896;-82.8409
