Very low-flying cylinder craft w/ mostly green (less red) lights that trailed behind it,;2017-04-25 23:53:00;20;Very low-flying cylinder craft w/ mostly green (less red) lights that trailed behind it, Plant City My cat (who is deaf btw) started staring off into the sky with ears up which is the only reason it made me look...it was very low flying, silent, almost shaped like a very narrow rectangle but there was no definite start/end to the structure I could see because it was night and there were lights on it that were more defined at the front but hazey towards the rear… green lights on the front, red and white on the back…  not little dot lights, very large and bright.  It moved almost gracefully from the moment I saw it, until it was blocked from view by a tree and no longer visible on a perfectly straight line, no altitude changes (maybe 35 mph??)....  it almost didn't look real because it was so close and bright.  How it was able to move without any sounds has my head spinning bc it was large and closer to me than any helicopter would ever be capable of flying… I don't know how large they make drones, but it would amaze me if someone in this small town had the ability and finances to acquire something like that...this is something I've never seen before.  I'm still in shock.;28.0181153225808;-82.1351120967747
