It was a wonderful birthday present. I was taking my kids to school, on the morning of 10-20-94, as we crossed some railroad tracks, I looked up in the sky to the north and saw a small silver saucer shaped object, I said to my children look up there and pointed to the saucer, at this point we were amazed. I turned north at the next street which was across the tracks, tried to follow it and then it disappears into thin air.;28.0181153225808;-82.1351120967747

The;2003-10-15 11:00:00;2 minutes;On my way out to the shed in our back yard to put a tool up, I wittnessed over the Oak tree tops behind our shed a saucer hovering. The trees are fully grown and stand maybe 50' height and the sauser was hovering maybe just a few feet above them.  I only saw it because of the moon light.  It had no lights.  It was maybe about 30' in diameter.  It made no noise.  I staired at it for a few moments trying to get a grip on the moment.  I called my wife to hurry out side and see this.  She was in the kitchen by the back door and came out saying What?. I pointed up and she looked up and said Oh my God.  She walked up next to me and stood there for a moment and staired at it with me.  She said Is that what I think it is?.  I responded Ya.  Then after a moment, It started to rise up, more like it was drifting up in the air like a ballon that a kid let go of at the fair.  Then when it got to the point were we had to squint our eyes to see it, it darted off at an incredible speed.  Like o MPH to hundreds of MPH in a second.  It stired my curiousity and my wifes religion.;28.0181153225808;-82.1351120967747
