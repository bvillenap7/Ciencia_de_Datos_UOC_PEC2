Orange Gliding Objects in the Night Sky;2012-08-13 21:30:00;5 minutes;Orange Gliding Objects in the Night Sky It was a clear night, and I noticed in a southern range that there were four bright orange lights in the sky, spaced evenly apart, but not in a straight line. At first I thought they were lights atop electrical towers.  But as I drove closer, I noticed they were not attached to anything. I pulled the car over because I wanted to observe the lights for awhile.  They were traveling slowly, almost gliding, in a west to east direction.   Each one was a brightly colored orange light they sparkled and were quite pretty. I looked to the west and saw that others were coming into my view. This was good because as the others traveled towards the night clouds, they disappeared.  The &quotshow&quot lasted about five minutes and then they had all disappeared. I called my friend who lived on my street, and as I was close to my neighborhood, she was able to see them as well.  She also told me that she had seen them a couple of months ago but never mentioned it. After doing a brief search on the Internet,  I saw that these same objects have been sighted all over the country in the past few months, and there were reports from the UK as well.;28.0181153225808;-82.1351120967747
Bright orange circular object with red lights around it;2013-10-26 19:30:00;1 minute;Bright orange circular object with red lights around it My son and I saw a low-flying, completely silent object from a distance and watched as it passed right over us.  I thought it had to be a helicopter but it was absolutely silent and close.  It was a bright orange circle with red lights around it...very bright and not like anything I've ever seen before.  I used ((a bad word)) in front of my kid if that tells you my level of disbelief.;28.0181153225808;-82.1351120967747
