unknown object fell from clear sky.;2006-05-15 07:30:00;sudden;unknown object fell from clear sky. I was on the way to work, from Lakeland to Tampa, FL.   Traveling west bound on I-4.  While passing through the area of Plant City, I heard a loud thump on the top of my car.  Similar to the sound of a body hitting the roof.  I thought it was a large bird.   I immediately looked in my rear view mirror.  There was nothing falling off the top of my car.  I pulled over and stopped.  There is a large dent covering over 1/3 of the roof.  No sign of feathers or blood.  I had not gone under a bridge or overpass.  No plane visible above.  Clear sky.  No distinct clouds.  I am only sending you this information in case it has happened to some one else, as well.  Do not wish to be contacted.;28.0181153225808;-82.1351120967747
The black object  flew at a  constant speed, high altitude, in an uncommon & constantly changing flight path then vanished instantly.;2008-04-22 15:26:00;approx. 2 min;The black object  flew at a  constant speed, high altitude, in an uncommon & constantly changing flight path then vanished instantly. Today I witnessed a flying object that I definitely could not identify, it was unlike anything I had ever seen before. I am a 24 year old man, healthy, with perfect eyesight, and no history of mental illness of any type. I am not prone to exaggerations or having an overactive imagination. I served in the U.S. Army a few years back, and I do not drink or do any type of drugs, nor do I take any kind of medication. What follows is a detailed description of the object I saw this afternoon while sitting by the pool with my fiance. She did not see the object because her view was obstructed by some small shade trees surrounding the pool, also her eyesight is not that great, and by the time I told her what I was seeing, the object was seconds away from disappearing from sight. The object seemed to be flying at an extremely high altitude, making it appear extremely small and making it very difficult to discern it's actual shape and size. From my position on the ground it was like watching a tiny sugar ant! It appeared to be dark in color, probably black. The object appeared to be opaque, and it did not seem to reflect the sunlight or emanate any light of its own either. It moved in and out of the few clouds that were in the sky mostly at a constant speed, although it did seem to speed up somewhat as it left from view. The really odd thing is that it did not disappear from sight into the clouds, but rather just seemed to become invisible into a clear blue sky. There was very little cloud cover at the time, but I did see what appeared to be a very faint trail of vapor or exhaust trailing behind it. It flew in a very odd flight path that I've never seen with airplanes, helicopters or birds. First it seemed to make a circular pattern, then a figure eight, followed by a straight line from left to right, and then back from right to left, it again made one or two circles, one more figure eight, and another circle, before simply disappearing into a cloudless patch of blue sky. Another thing that struck me as odd, and this my fiance did witness first hand too, is that there were several large black birds that flew above us just a short while before the object first came into view. They were flying towards us, in the opposite direction of where I saw the object. At first several of them were flying pretty high up, but they were still very clearly recognizable as birds. This is why I know for certain that the object I saw afterwards could not have been a bird, for one thing it was flying at an altitude that was much higher than any of the birds, who at one point were flying about as high as any birds I've ever seen before, although later they flew above us again but at a much lower altitude. Also the flight path & speed of the object was so completely different from  birds or any known ai! rcraft, at least in my experience.;28.0181153225808;-82.1351120967747
