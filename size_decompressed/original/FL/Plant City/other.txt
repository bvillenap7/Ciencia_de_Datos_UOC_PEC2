At Approximately 12:00 PM Thursday March 5, 2009 I was looking into the upper skies slightly toward the north.  I spotted a white colored object, as I peered through my Arnette polarized sunglasses.  The object was between the 10 and 2 oâ€™clock position. The object appeared to be about the size of a bright planet at night.  The shape was similar to a large jet.  The object was moving in an easterly direction at a relatively low rate of speed.  The object turned to the northeast and appeared to be ascending when it quickly disappeared.  There was no contrail and no sound from where I stood.  The elapsed time was approximately ten seconds.;28.0181153225808;-82.1351120967747

Heard very very fast militiary type aircraft approaching from west to east and then the sound traveled verticle.  Nothing visible.;2013-05-31 13:00:00;15 seconds;Heard very very fast militiary type aircraft approaching from west to east and then the sound traveled vertical.  There was no visisble craft.  The noise sounded like a militiary jet doing manuevers at an airshow,but once again no visible craft. The sound was measured with my arms sticking straight out east and west (63 inches) and it would have taken the craft 3 seconds of travel time to cover the distance.
