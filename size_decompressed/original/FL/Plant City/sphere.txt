Friend and I found in his front yard about 9:30 Thursday night 22 of Feb., tonight.;2018-02-22 21:30:00;still on;Friend and I found in his front yard about 9:30 Thursday night, 22 of Feb., tonight. A light was glowing in the field in front of his house out in the country.  He went to it and picked it up and it was a clear plastic like object about the size of a marble, with bright light emitting from what looked to be the top.  It was in a white paper bag about 2in. X 2in., like a coffee filter type material.   We cut the bag and dumped it on his kitchen counter and the light dimmed and went out very quickly.  What to do with it we don't know.  Right now its in his flower pot outside.  I have snap shots and videos of it. I don't believe its what you would call a U.F.O., but would like help to find out what it is.  Thanks.
