Fireball-like craft seen flickering in the sky.;2012-12-21 06:45:00;4 minutes;Fireball-like craft seen flickering in the sky. I was heading back for my house after dropping my husband off at work, and an object in the sky caught my eye.  It looked like something flaming coming down to earth, but when I kept observing, it did not come down, but rather hover and shift positions.   After a few minutes it flickered and then disappeared in thin air.  At first I was scared it was an asteroid or something of the like.   I have never seen anything like that in my life.  I wish I would have had some way to record it but I was driving with 3 children in the car so I had to drive safely.;28.0181153225808;-82.1351120967747
