While walking westerly at 9:05 PM EDT on Saunders Street between Franklin and Burton Streets in Plant City Florida, I saw a phosphourescent green orb shaped object about the size of Venus move on a very straight and rapid trajectory from the southeast to northwest 15 degrees above the northeast horizon.  There was no sound, and the object appeared to have no tail.   Weather was clear and cool. Moon was in the western sky 45 degrees above horizon.  Venus to its immediate north, Orion to its south.   Several high flying (25,000-40,000 feet high) commercial airliners before and after sighting, but not during.;28.0181153225808;-82.1351120967747
UFO Recovery Witnessed in Florida??;2000-09-15 20:30:00;3 minutes;UFO Recovery Witnessed in Florida?? My husband and I were headed North on Hwy 39, just outside of Plant City, FL, at about 8:30 pm.   Suddenly there was a bright flash of light which drew our attention to the sky where we saw an orange-yellow oval object which appeared to be on fire racing across the sky.  It's fire tail disapated and the object continued to glow that orange-yellow color. We have seen many such objects but this one appeared to be in distress.  It just didn't look right.  Fearing that it would crash we headed East on the nearest side road.  The object was on the North side of this road, but its path took it across the road as it was headed in an East/SouthEast direction.  We estimated where this object would fall or intended to land, and raced East down Hwy. 60, to the city of Mulberry, about 12 miles away.  We saw nothing else that night, but what we saw the next day will make me wonder just what we saw for the rest of my life.  Just outside the city of Mulberry, we saw police and military personnel manning the perimiters of an abandoned phosphate mine and trainyard(across from IMC Rainbow Phosphate Co.)   There were over 20 marked police vehicles(state and local), atleast the same number of unmarked police/federal vehicles, and four canvas covered military cargo trucks.  There were over 60 soldiers in fatigues holding M-16's securing the area.  I know a woman who lives in that area, and on her way home that day she was turned away and asked to take another route home due to an enraged man with a gun that was threating to take his own life, and the life of his daughter.  None of these activities were reported on any of the local news channels.  I am convinced that what we witnessed was a UFO crash recovery. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
