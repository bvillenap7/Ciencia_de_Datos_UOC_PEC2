So while we were watching all this I see what I thought was a star blink like 3 or 4 times really bright then it started moving not fast like a shooting star but almost like it was cruising with very smooth motion, no way it could be a plane,  Then my girlfriend pointed out 2 other stars began moving as well all in different directions.  We watched one of them go from north to south for about 10mins before it was out of site. Very very strange and interesting enough we went out 2 weeks ago to Melbourne Beach and and saw like 5 of these but I never reported it but now that we have seen this twice I am very concerned.;28.6987;-80.8699999999999
