3 unidentified craft/yellow lights/totally silent/observed 3 minutes/ flying  SSW 19:17 hrs  towards Orlando;2008-01-23 19:17:00;3 minutes;3 unidentified craft/yellow lights/totally silent/observed 3 minutes/ flying  SSW 19:17 hrs  towards Orlando I am retired from the Canadian Air Force and am familiar with aircraft shapes and sounds. At 1917 hours on 23 January 2008 I observed what I thought was an aircraft light heading south at approx 180 degrees.  As this light got closer I realized that it was a yellow light and there were no flashing red, green or strobe lights visible.  Upon further observation as this object got closer I realized that this object was flying in a vertical position with yellow lights down the center and on vertical arms on both sides of the main body. The object changed directions slightly to the South West onto a heading of approx 210 degrees heading towards Orlando. Further to viewing this craft I observed that there was absolutely NO sound emitting from it.  This craft disappeared into the South West without appearing to speed up. Approximately a minute or so later I observed two more similar craft coming from the North.  These two craft followed the same flight path and were traveling at the same altitude and speed as the first one that I reported.  The only difference was that the second craft was not lit up near as much as the first one.  The third craft was lit up more than the second one but not as much as the first one. I have been observing commercial aircraft on a regular basis here in Florida and they fly overhead and continue south to Miami or Fort Lauderdale.  The three unidentified craft I observed last evening turned to the South West which was not the normal flight pattern for commercial aircraft. In conclusion I cannot name what I saw, but I can say, the three objects I observed were NOT AIRCRAFT (jet, prop. Or helicopter);28.6987;-80.8699999999999
lighted object(s) moved from north to south, southwest while in a vertical position;2008-01-23 19:17:00;2 minutes;lighted object(s) moved from north to south, southwest while in a vertical position January 23, 2008@7:17 p.m. EST I viewed a lighted object from the North coming  south. The object was flying vertical and its body was lit up solid yellowish with best as I can describe objects on either side (wing-like) they were also lit up but not solid it appeared to be individual lights outlining the entire wing structure.  The object did not have any other coloured lights or flashing lights.  The object continued south then changed direction to south west.  It disappeared or it was not visible from the back.  This abject did not have any sound whatsoever as it was a quiet peaceful night here.  Within a minute or so I observed two more of these objects flying in the same direction (one was flying before the other and the first one was not as bright as the original the third one was a little brighter than the second) they also followed what appeared to be the same path as the original object again no sound.  What I found extremely interesting is they were all vertical.  We are on a flight path of several jet planes and small prop planes none of which use this particular path I observed with these three objects;28.6987;-80.8699999999999
