Lights moving in the sky;2009-12-06 20:45:00;2 min;Lights moving in the sky I saw what at first appeared to be a planet (as it was not twinkling) near the top right side of Orions belt to the east on a clear night. There was no engine noise like from a plane and the object appeared stationary for about 1 minute. Then I noticed 4 dim red/orange lights in a backwards 7 type formation with the white planet out in front of the tip of the backwards seven. The red/orange lights slowly flashed or pulsated several times while remaining in formation. They were located slightly below and to the right of the planet. I quickly snapped a photo with a camera phone and continued to watch. Then noticed the white planetdrift slowly down and to the left side of Orions belt. About 45 sec from top star in belt to middle star. Tried to get another photo to show the change in position in relation to Orions belt. Red/ orange lights were no longer visible so I ran to turn off the lights nearby to try to get a better look and take another photo. The plane! t then moved quicker and further down and to the left. In about 20 seconds it went from the middle star to below and to the left of the bottom star in the belt. Then it appeard to flash red/orange and disappeared.
