West to East was a straight line of what appeared to be air craft of some sort.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-30 21:35:00;5 Minutes;My wife was taking the garbage down around 9:20 p.m., she ran back to tell me to come outside quickly. Up in the sky moving West to East was a straight line of what appeared to be air craft of some sort. Each craft had only one single bright white with the exception of two that I saw. Those two craft had 2 lights on them in a straight line from West to East in the direction of the flight path. The last two craft were side by side bringing up the rear and they all disappeared shortly after passing overhead at or near 10 oâ€™clock in the sky. There was no sound and no flashing indicator lights like you would see on commercial aircraft. The speed seemed to be much much faster then that of a commercial air line also. The parade of light were spaced equally in a straight line and lasted for almost 5 minutes with what we guess was 30-50 air craft. In the final few minutes our neighbor came out and witnessed the objects as well. We did try to capture a photo but they! did not come out.;28.5976;-81.6813
