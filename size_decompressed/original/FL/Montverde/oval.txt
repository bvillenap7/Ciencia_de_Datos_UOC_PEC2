We were crossing 7th street, between CHAPS and the General Store. What we saw was not exactly oval, but larger at the top. It was a bright yellow/gold object hovering about 100 feet up. It made a faint eep sound which is what attracted our attention.  I have to tell you it was something to see!  It moved off after a minute or so, slowly at first but then very fast. My wife quite ((deleted)). It blurred right before it sped off. It seemed lit from within.;28.5976;-81.6813
Object in sky over Clermont, FL;2003-03-20 22:30:00;I stayed out there for 30;Object in sky over Clermont, FL I am a dorm parent at a boarding school.  I had just gotten the girls down to bed and went outside to smoke a cig.  Looked up and had to look again, this light was stationary and had blinking lights on it.  Looked like red/orange, blue and white.  I went and got 2 of my students to make sure I wasn't seeing things.  They saw the same thing I did.  I got my camera, mount it on the trypod and took a few shots.  I have not gotten them developed yet. I'm not sure how clear they are.  I took several shots with different time lapses.  The craft only moved slightly everyonce in a while, but kept blinking the whole time.  I unfortunately had to go into bed.  I saw the object over Clermont,FL, I was on the 3rd story of the dorm and could see the night sky clearly.  (I will ge the images developed very soon) !!!!;28.5976;-81.6813
