I was alarmed because lightning that far away is not that bright.  I saw a rectangle shape that looked like a missile launching (that is the only way I could describe it because it was so big and bright)   I stopped my car in the middle of the road and looked backwards. The light was in the middle of the sky through the lighting it was so bright and it started getting bigger and I saw it shrinking (I thought it was coming toward me)   So I quickly drove home as fast as I could.  When I got home the lighting was still going on for 45 minutes.  My thoughts are is the lighting was a cover up for its showing.  I've also seen a blue orb this past week come from the trees in the woods across the road in front of me.   I didn't think all of this was real I was trying to come up with excuses but after this Huge appearance I know its real.;28.5976;-81.6813
