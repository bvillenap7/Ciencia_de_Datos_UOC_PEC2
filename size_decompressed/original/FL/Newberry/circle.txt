Unidentified star-like object moved back and forth, then flashed on and off several times above treeline.  ((anonymous report));2019-05-22 22:05:00;4 minutes;Unidentified star like object moved back and forth, then flashed on and off several times above treeline. One multicolored circular (almost star like) unidentified object visible above treeline. Looked almost as if many different colored lights were very close together.  Looked to be very far away.  We thought it was a star or planet in view but then the lights turned on and off several times followed by a slight side to side, hovering movement.  It was not similar at all to an airplane, which we see a lot of here.  The movement was slow but obvious.   There are a lot of cow fields in this area and plenty of trees, but not too many people.
