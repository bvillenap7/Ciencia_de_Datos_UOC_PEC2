The object looked to be about 20 or 25 feet in length and 10 feet thick on the front end and tappering in the rear. The sighting took place on my friends rual property outside of Newberry FL to the west. The craft headed north and as it moved further from us it started arching east and looked to be headed over the town. When it got close to town it speed up and zipped out of site within a matter of seconds. The object looked to be lighted internally. It made no sound and at the close distance we saw it we should have heard at least something if it was plane.;29.6609;-82.585
