There were 3 objects in the sky that were spaced apart and they were all changing colors and shape.  They were not drones because they were in the sky for at least 30 minutes, maybe longer.  It was a clear night so my mom and I could see them very well, we could see a lot of stars.  I know they werenâ€™t stars because the changing colors and shape.
