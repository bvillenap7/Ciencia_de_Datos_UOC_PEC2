Strange Lights over Bartow, FL;2007-11-17 18:30:00;3-4 Min.;Strange Lights over Bartow, FL While driving east on State Road 60, just as we were approaching the city of Bartow, my wife and I observed a bright light directly in front of us. I cannot say what the distance was from our location. As we watched the bright light, it began to descend and suddenly sepparated into 2 separate lights.  At first I thought that it was a firework of some sort but quickly realized that it was much too high in the sky. Almost immediately after the 2 descending lights were no longer visible, we spotted another light slowly growing brighter and brighter. About 10 seconds later there was another light and then another and then another. We saw a total of 6 lights maximum at one time. Then it seemd as if they were taking turns turning their lights on and off because we saw 6 of them, then 4, then 2, then 3 etc, etc. until finally approx after 3 or 4 minutes total, there was nothing.;27.8957;-81.8118000000001
A white orb of light moving South/Southwest to North/Northeast at 20:30 hours. ((NUFORC Note:  Intl. Space Station.  PD));2017-03-27 20:30:00;~30 seconds;A white orb of light moving South/Southwest to North/Northeast at 20:30 hours. I was outside smoking a cigarette and looked up.  A white light was moving through the sky.  I did not see any flashing lights as you would see on an aircraft.  It was also not a satellite it was to low and much to big.  Also not a weather balloon it was moving South/Southwest to North/Northeast and the wind direction is East to West tonight.  It moved at a fairly good speed but I would say a little quicker than an airplane.  As it moved across the sky, I have an uninterrupted view, in the Northerly sky a plane came into view from the East and flew North.  This took about the same time to fly through the smaller quadrant of sky as the light took to get all the way from South/Southwest to North/Northeast.  The light was below the higher clouds as it passed over me but disappeared into the lower level clouds in the North/Northeast.  It was shaped like on orb of light however every now and again it appeared to have three points of light coming off of it in the shape of a peace sign without the bottom middle leg of the sign.  That may have been refraction I'm not sure.   I am a Science Teacher and have seen satellites in various different states and in Newfoundland.  I have been a part of groups that went out during meteor showers.  And I am familiar with aircraft my Grandfather was a Maintenance Supervisor for American Airlines and I have seen many different aircraft lights at night.  Just not sure what I saw I could not identify it.;27.8957;-81.8118000000001
