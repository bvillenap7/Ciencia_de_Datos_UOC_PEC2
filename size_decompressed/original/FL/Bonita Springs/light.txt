Bright white objects in night sky seen in SW Florida;2003-07-06 21:00:00;1-5 minutes;Bright white objects in night sky seen in SW Florida While watching tv, I turned my head towards my husband and a bright white light caught my eye.  The curtains were open to the kitchen window, since I really wanted to see for sure what my husband and neighbor had seen on the fourth while outside watching the neighborhood fireworks.  The city display had exploded out on Lover's Key shortly before.   It was much brighter than the moon and had no craters, which I look at through my telescope.  It moved slowly from north to the south.  Seemed to be a football shape. I made a picture of what I remember, but have no way to post it, a watercolor painting.  I almost always have something to say, but didn't even say anything to him til after.   A couple weeks later saw 2 of same further away in SW sky, at first thought they were strange stars which looked out of place, I was going to check them with my star chart, until I realized they backed off out of sight, like they caught me looking at them. I felt they came because of the Lover's Key incident, and keep an eye on things.;26.3701848484849;-81.7513020202021
Several orange colored lights in west sky of Bonita Springs, there 1 moment and gone the next;2013-12-07 18:45:00;10-15 seconds;several orange colored lights in west sky of Bonita Springs, there 1 moment and gone the next Today, 12-7-13 in Bonita Springs,FL at approximately 6:45pm I saw what looked to be like orange colored lights in the sky to the west.  I saw 10 to 15 lights that normally I would have taken them to be stars but given the color of the sky at the time, and the fact that they were an unusual color and standing out so much I don't think they could have been stars.  They were positioned much closer to the horizon and given the color of the sky behind them they couldn't have been stars.  I looked higher up and located a normal star and it was much whiter in color.  I drove my car up further on the road I was on, I looked for them again and they were all gone, I couldn't locate 1 of them.  If they were stars I would have been able to see them again.;26.3701848484849;-81.7513020202021
