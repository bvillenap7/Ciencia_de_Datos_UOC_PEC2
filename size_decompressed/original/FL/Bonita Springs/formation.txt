I saw two white lights in formation one ahead of the other surrounded by red sphere's of transparent light.   They were moving straight across the sky at around 20 degrees as fast as a shooting star but without a trail, then they flew out of distance   Airplanes, comets, or satelites are out of the question as I have observed these before.;26.3701848484849;-81.7513020202021
