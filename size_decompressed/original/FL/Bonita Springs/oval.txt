A friend & myself, observed an oval shaped orange & white glow move across his house.  It was approximately 1,000 to possibly 1,500 miles up.   Came from the East, heading in a straight line West.  It was silent, did not stop, but kept a straight path west, towards the Gulf of Mexico.  It was oval shaped, glowed in orange, & had a sliver of white light.  No lights were detected on this craft, such as an airplane or helicopter.    I researched my sighting description online, & found exact images of what my friend & I saw from many others in many countries, termed as Japanese lanterns.;26.3701848484849;-81.7513020202021
