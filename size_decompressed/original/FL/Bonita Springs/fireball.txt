Orange ball of light moving horizontally through the sky towards the Gulf of Mexico.;2012-01-01 00:05:00;3 minutes;Orange ball of light moving horizontally through the sky towards the Gulf of Mexico. It was New Years Eve 2011.  My friends and I were outside watching the fireworks go off in my neighborhood.  While watching for fireworks we all noticed this orange ball of light that was moving horizontally across the sky.  There were no blinking lights or spotlights I am positive it was not an airplane or helicopter. I am not sure what it was that we saw.  It stayed at the same height going straight across the sky horizontally for about 3 minutes.   We knew it wasn't a firework because it didn't have a tail and it also wasn't going up it was moving to West.   After the 3 minutes it disappeared as it was too far away to see.  It was the weirdest thing.;26.3701848484849;-81.7513020202021
