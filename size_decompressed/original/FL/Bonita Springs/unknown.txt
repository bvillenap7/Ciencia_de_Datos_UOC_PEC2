I retired from the Air Force and am familiar with normal flight patterns.  As the cloud dissapated the lights disappeared. I made a short video with my digital camera and will e mail it to you;26.3701848484849;-81.7513020202021
Just prior to sunrise, I was awakened by bright lights.;2015-10-31 06:15:00;5 minutes;My bedroom window faces the backyard, which is full of wild aloe, trees, bushes, NO houses, NO roads.   Just prior to sunrise, I was awakened by bright lights.  At first I thought it was a car driving by, but then wondered what car, there's no road or house outside of my window.   So then I thought it may have been a flashlight?  Was there someone outside of my window?   About a minute later I saw three circular white lights in line with each other and a single on beneath flashing through my bedroom window's curtain this was definitely not a flashlight.    I was too frightened to look out the window.  The lights didn't return once the sun rose. Found this website and previous posts lead me to believe what I saw.  Did anyone else see these? This is the second occurrence.;26.3701848484849;-81.7513020202021
Fast moving object with lights in Southern sky over Naples, Florida traveling West to East...;2016-04-23 22:27:00;3 seconds;Fast moving object with lights in Southern sky over Naples, Florida traveling West to East... While looking to the South, I witnessed a very fast moving object which had at least 2 visible lights on it, moving from West to East above the tree tops, but far enough away to suspect it was off at a distance of miles.  It traveled faster than any human occupied object, and turned to the South before speeding off quickly even faster.  It made no noise, nor did noise arrive after it passed.;26.3701848484849;-81.7513020202021
