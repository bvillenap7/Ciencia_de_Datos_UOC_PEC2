I WAS WALKING MY DOG WHEN I LOOKED UP OVER THE SOUTHEAST SIDE OF MY HOME WHEN I SAW THIS OBJECT EMMITING THESE COLORED LIGHTS FROM IT AND I SAID WHAT THE HELL IS IT. I WENT IN AND GOT MY BINOCULARS AND I WENT BACK OUT TO GET A REALLY GOOD LOOK AND OH MY GOD THERE IT WAS. I HEN CALLED MY FRIEN AND TOLD HER TO GET RIGHT OVER HERE TO BE WITH ME. IT BEGAN TO GO FURTHER OVER THE GULF SO WE GOT IN THE CAR AND WENT TO THE BEACH AND THERE WE WATCHED IT FOR A FEW MINUTES WHEN WE SAW 1 MORE THEN 2 MORE AND THEN 1 MORE . 2 WERE TO THE RIGHT AND 2 WERE TO THE LEFT. THE 2 TO THE LEFT LOOKED AS IF THEY WERE AN INCH APART THRU MY LENSES. THE BIG ONE HAD A LIGHT COME FROM IT S IF IT WERE A SEARCH BEAM THEN IT WENT FURTHER OUT OVER THE GULF. THEN THE 2 TO THE RIGHT FOLLOWED THE BIG ONE UNTIL IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT. THE 2 ON THE LEFT GOT FURTHER AWAY UNTIL IT LOOKED AS IF THEY WERE ONE.

White circle of multiple lights in Bonita Springs, FL;2007-05-15 22:15:00;30-45 minutes;White circle of multiple lights in Bonita Springs, FL At about 10:00pm to 10:15pm eastern daylight time, I sited a circle of lights, black in the center, at about Northwest from I-75 and Bonita Beach Road in Bonita Springs Florida.  I attempted to take pictures but the pictures appeared as a mottled solid circle.  Much of the mottling was due to the high ISO 800 setting that was required to shoot the pictures.  The object would seem to be over water.  The lights dimmed as though obscured by clouds.  They would then increase with intensity.  The object remained in the same position for some time, maybe Â½ hour or more.;26.3701848484849;-81.7513020202021
