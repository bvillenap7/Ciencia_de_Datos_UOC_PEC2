((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star??  PD)) I was putting my son to bed and was drawn to the window by a bright light. When I looked outside it was a big ball of light changing colors and flashing. Brighter than any normal lights.  I grabbed my camera and began taking photos for more than one hour. I quit while it was still there thinking I must be crazy and thought I would go out in the morning and see some sort of pole with a light on it, or other rational explanation. But there was nothing. Many photos came out just blank and others are extraordinary.  I ended up with about 50 that show the formation of different shapes, splitting apart and coming back together, and in the photos it appears to be farther away and sometime closer. But to  my naked eye it never moved, only pulsated. I shot video as well but that only captured a flashing light and a hint of changing shapes and colors. I have seen similiar footage of that online. It is the still photos that really captured actual images and shapes. I h! ad to suppress my flash as when I used that I just got a blank screen, so the photos show the lights with a black background as it was dark. I'm not sure who to have look at my photos as I believe no one has ever captured what I did. Video doesn't capture it.  I still have the photos on my camera and cell phone camera to prove I did not alter the images in any way. Any suggestions of who is an expert to have look at them?;26.3701848484849;-81.7513020202021
