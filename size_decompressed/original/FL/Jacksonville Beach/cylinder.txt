Orange, lantern-like, glowing, fast fireball that made no sound.;2016-03-09 19:00:00;30 seconds;orange lantern-like glowing fast fireball that made no sound. Looked like a lantern kite, hovered up from what seemed to be beach area and headed north by northwest.  However, its speed was someone like a fast helicopter...no noise, seemed to have a flame/flickering light source underneath it...so not like a tail of a fireball streak.   Once it was at cruising altitude, it stayed parallel with ground and increased speed gradually till it was finally so far away the light became to dim to make out.  Was not a plane or helicopter, and too close to earth and straight/steady to be some sort of falling debris. ((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT)) It's 100% true.  I was playing with my son in the front yard and we were pointing up to the stars when we saw it.  I always scoffed at reports like this and said, Why wouldn't they have a picture if it was real.  Then of course, it happens to me, and not only did I not have my phone to take a picture...honestly I didn't even think about it.  I was too busy staring at it, following it down the road, and if anything...looking around to see if my neighbors were out....but to no avail.  I'll be out in the front yard again tonight, with phone in hand.  Sorry for the lack of documentation, but I swear it's true. ((END ADDENDUM));30.2801;-81.4164999999999
