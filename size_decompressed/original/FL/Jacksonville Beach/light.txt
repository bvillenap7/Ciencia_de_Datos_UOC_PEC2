Unidentified lights over Jacksonville Beach;2009-04-07 23:20:00;60 seconds;Unidentified lights over Jacksonville Beach My wife and I checked in to the Quality Inn Suites on Jacksonville Beach, Florida on Tuesday, April 7th 2009 for a few days of R&R.  At 11:20 pm that night I walked out onto our 6th floor balcony, overlooking the ocean, to join my wife.  It was an absolutely clear night and only a night away from a completely full moon.    I had only been out there a few moments when I noticed some unusual running lights off to my left.  They were clumped together instead of the normal wingtips and tail and were flashing different colors continuously.  I’m an Air Force veteran and I’ve seen more than my share of a wide variety of aircraft.   I asked my wife if she saw the same thing I did and she said yes and asked me if I knew what it was.  I couldn’t determine how far away the object was but since I wasn’t looking up to see it from the sixth floor I’d say it was less than 1000 feet up and was tracking along in a straight & level flight path.  I grabbed up the binoculars I’d brought with me for the trip and after a few moments locating it in the binoculars (it’s harder than you’d think) I was just getting focused in and they lights just “blinked out”.   I pulled down the binoculars thinking I’d somehow just lost it in the binoculars but it was completely gone.  There was no trace of it anywhere.  I can’t say I saw a flying saucer.  I can say, without a doubt, my wife and I saw an Unidentified Flying Object that was there one moment and gone the next.;30.2801;-81.4164999999999

4 orange lights following each other in the sky and fading out.;2013-03-29 21:00:00;5 minutes;4 orange lights following each other in the sky and fading out At 9:15 PM I walked outside to get something out of my vehicle when I saw what I thought was a shooting star. I noticed that it was a bright orange glowing light that was lasting much too long to be a shooting star.   After watching it for 30 seconds or so, I started recording it with my cell phone.  I video taped it traveling from the south east towards the north west. After video taping it for 2 minutes or so, the orange light began to blink and faded out. Immediately following it fading out, another one appeared over the tree line at the same exact spot the previous one started. 3 more orange lights followed in the same exact line.   While traveling in the same direction, the lights appeared to be swaying or moving in a faint zig-zag line.  In other words, they appeared to not be traveling in an exact straight line.   The lights were brighter than stars but not brighter than the moon.   Airplanes were flying during the same time frame and this showed us there was a! clear difference in the airplanes and the orange glowing lights,;30.2801;-81.4164999999999
