This object seemed to maintain its position due East and was flashing.  This rate of flash seemed to follow an erratic pattern in terms of time.  I observed this object for about 10 minutes and it seemed to vanish behind the lowest layer of clouds and reappeared during this 10 min. duration and then again vanished with no return. The remarkable aspects of this object were that it seemed to maintain its position and the major characteristic was that it was mostly made up of light which was visible in the afternoon sunlight.  In other words, this object hovered too long for it to be an airplane and too high to be a helicopter and noticed its light emissions in the bright sunlight.  When I turned away 180 degrees for a brief moment (for about 45 seconds after 5 minutes into my observation) and then turned back 180 degrees and looked back at the approximate direction of this object, it was visible in the exact spot of my last view. I am unsure of the altitude of this object because I do not know the size. My opinion is that this object was quite large and that it was much higher in altitude than say an airplane flying at about 15,000 skipping in and out of the view against the lower layer of clouds.  I am unsure of the color and shape of this object but I can describe it by stating that it resembled a drop of mercury. There were other bathers present however, I am unaware if these bathers noticed this anomaly.  There was a seagull flying in the distance and I did not remember seeing any planes in the air.  I also noticed a ship heading South about 5 to 10 miles due East of my viewpoint.;30.2801;-81.4164999999999
