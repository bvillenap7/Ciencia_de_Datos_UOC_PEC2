Walked outside around 10:15pm on 06/22/2015 and looked south (in Jacksonville, Fl) in the sky and saw an object hovering in the sky with green, white, and red flashing lights.  Not in any pattern.   After about 15 minutes of watching the object hover, it then started to descend, in a straight, smooth manner towards the ground.   After 5 minutes of it not in view, the same exact object, flew back into view, going right back to the spot it was in before.   Another 15 minutes had passed of me observing while it hovered,and it began to move downward, descending then abruptly stopping.  Then it darted to the left and finally descended out of view.   It was unlike anything I've ever seen!;30.2801;-81.4164999999999

I was too far away to say anything more than the light appeared circular.   I took video and picture but not much detail can be seen.   A small airplane flew by a few minutes later and it had some alternative g lights on its bottom, but it was not the same craft.   Someone else posted it could've been a lantern, but I think not because of the color changing.  If anything a drone with lights...or something else.;30.2801;-81.4164999999999
