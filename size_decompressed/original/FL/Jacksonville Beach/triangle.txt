Star gazing turns to UFO gazing;2002-09-14 00:30:00;30 seconds;Star gazing turns to UFO gazing It was a friday or saturday night, one of the first cool nights we have had here in florida.  My wife and I were out star gazing as we always do when weather permits.  There had been a lot of overcast the past few weekends enabling us to enjoy our hobby.  This evening was a little cloudy but not bad so we were not going to miss it!  We set up as quick as we could and started gazing.  As I said it was cloudy so when the clouds were over head we would take a break, sit and have some coffee, smoke, whatever.  During one of are little breaks my brother-in-law came by to talk, so he sat outside with us.  Later around 0030 or 0100 it happend something we never thought would, as I looked to the sky to check the cloud cover I seen a pitch black Triangle moving very slowly across the sky.  I pointed to the sky and asked donnie to look up when he did he couldn't believe it.  I yelled to my wife who was getting coffee when I told her to look up she did and droped the cups.  I hurried to get the camera pointed and snaped some shots.  It was heading SSE very slowly and did not make a sound the entire time,  It was very close to the ground as well I say that because the clouds helped to define it's shape, because it was below the clouds.  When I started snaping pictures It changed direction from SSE to ENE and was gone just like that.  We saw no lights at all from the second we first seen it till it changed direction and left.  We sat outside the rest of the night hoping for it's return but have never seen it  or anything like it since.;30.2801;-81.4164999999999
Huge triangle of lights gliding smoothly southeast with no sound.;2005-09-28 02:38:00;15 minutes;Huge triangle of lights gliding smoothly southeast with no sound. I'm just a normal person who likes to nightly look for shooting stars when the weather permits. I first saw a line of orange glowing lights that appeared and glided southeast and disappeared within 30 seconds.  My mouth was hanging open, I've never seen anything like this.  Within the next five minutes a huge triangle of lights glided so smoothly, and with no noise what so ever, in the same direction. It was huge in size.  By then I was hyperventalating.  After it just disappeared, the clouds rolled in and I was unable to view anything else.  I am stunned and excited.  I've only told my daughter, I don't think anyone else would believe me;30.2801;-81.4164999999999

I immediately looked up and saw something either solid black or something of no mass at all.  What I did see was 3 lights, like very bright stars, in the formation of a triangle flying towards the ocean(east).  I live 3 blocks off the ocean right in the center of jacksonville beach, near the outdoor amphitheater.  The triangle object, or 3 lights in perfect formation slowly glided away from us heading east over the ocean.  The ocean-spray atmosphere made it harder to see the the object as it flew away, but it was definitely something very bright and very large with intelligence controlling it's motion and direction.  I'd say it was about 1,000 to 2,000 feet off the ground(about helicopter flying altitude maybe) and it was huge, probably hundreds of feet between each point of the triangle.  Oh and there was no sound at all.;30.2801;-81.4164999999999
