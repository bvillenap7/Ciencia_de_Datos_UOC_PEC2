We were on the balcony and something flew very close to the hotel, about 20 to 30 yards from where we sat on the 8th floor. We could easily have thrown a rock and hit it if we werent stunned by seeing it. It seemed oddly shaped like a rectangle but wobbly and it made the same noise a helicopter makes and it had a bright red glow coming from it which made the whole side of the hotel red. We didnt know what it was but an hour later we noticed lots of activity up the beach by naval station mayport, spotlights and the whole base lite up like a christmas tree. We then drove as close to mayport in neptune beach as possible and sat watching for hours all the activity out in the water. There was several helicopters with search lights skimming over the water, there were at least 12 total helicopters, 7 were skimming over the water about about 2 to 3 miles out, they would pass each other and come back and there were at least 5 helicopters we could see up the beach and up in the sky above the beach. We left after a few hours because we thought MPs would come out from the dunes and arrest us but as we left the electric boxes on the poles were all buzzing very loudly, we have been to the beach here before and the electric boxes didnt buzz like that normally. We went back to the hotel and in the morning there were still 4 or 5 helicopters skimming the water and at least 2 we could see flying about the beach. We checked the news and all the places online for any searches or rescues but nothing was reported.;30.2801;-81.4164999999999
Flying rectangle with an irregular flight pattern with green lights.;2006-06-20 10:30:00;30 seconds;Flying rectangle with an irregular flight pattern with green lights. Me, my brother, and my cousin were all in pool late night at my cousins house in Jacksonville and we were visiting from Michigan. It was a typical Florida evening but then i look up and see a flying rectangle with such an odd flight pattern it would fly vertically then go horizontally and then back vertically and back to horizontal perfectly. It had glowing green lights surrounding the UFO and we all saw it and all recall the moment. I've never really talked about it to anyone besides each other.;30.2801;-81.4164999999999

Almost 2 minutes after sitting there, my boyfriend shout look, a shooting star.  I look to the south west region of the sky and we both realize that it was in fact not a shooting star.  What we were observing was a ufo. It was a blue rectangular object with a domed top.  The object itself may not have been blue, but the aura around it had a blue hue. It seemed to be moving very quickly, as it was oby in the sky for 5-7 seconds, but crossed the majority of our sky, leaving no trail. In the moments after the object disappeared we heard a low rumble coming from the direction of the object that last 20 to 39 seconds.  We have observed approximately 7 to 10 planes in the sky since the sighting that seem to be cross hatching the sky, perhaps searching for traces of the object, or the object itself.;30.2801;-81.4164999999999
