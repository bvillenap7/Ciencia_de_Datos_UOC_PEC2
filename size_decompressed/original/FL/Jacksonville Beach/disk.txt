We were standing on the beach and noticed a very bright flashing light over the ocean, it was unlike any other flying craft that we were accustomed to.  There were other faint lights surrounding the object.  There were multiple smaller, colorful lights flashing that made it clear that the object was a disc.  A beam went down into the water for seconds at a time.  It appeared to hover over the ocean for 15 minutes without even moving at all, it was perfectly still.  Then, all of a sudden it flew away fairly quickly.;30.2801;-81.4164999999999
