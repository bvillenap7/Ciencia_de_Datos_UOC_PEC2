Sunny South West Florida;2011-03-12 17:45:00;10 min.;Sunny South West Florida While sitting in my driveway I saw an unusual lighted saucer type object. It went straight up into the unknown.  It was bright, fast, and silent.  I was able to take 3 pictures for even though it was fast it was far away and I had time to take a shot.;26.93742;-82.3257381818182
