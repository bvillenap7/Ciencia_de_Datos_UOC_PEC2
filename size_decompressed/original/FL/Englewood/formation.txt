They appeared not to be moving fast at all if at all.  They were white.  Then we notice close to the three objects  4 objects appeared.  As I asked her could they be skydivers but they were to low and I would say they were more of a aircraft.  As sheâ€™s looked back she could not find them and appeared to be gone.;26.93742;-82.3257381818182
