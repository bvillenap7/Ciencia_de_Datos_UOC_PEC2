fast moving object;2004-03-02 21:30:00;25 seconds;fast moving object On March 3, 2004 at 9:30PM, I saw an object flying much higher than normal aircraft toward the moon.  It was directly overhead and was heading toward the moon at a very high rate of speed.  It came from the west and was heading east.  There was some high, thin cloud cover but moon and some stars were visible.  As it neared the moon, it banked a turn toward the northwest quite rapidly.  There were some planes visible from where I was sitting, but the object appeared to be out of our atmosphere--suggesting that the object might have been quite large in reality.  It left no trail or tail and did not act as though it was a satellite or shooting star nor did it act like any aircraft I've ever seen!  To bank a turn as this object did and traveling at a high rate of speed only leads me to one thing...it had to be a UFO!  A few seconds after banking the turn, it shot away.  There's nothing I know of that can travel like that and cover so much sky in only about 25 seconds!  I have been a sky watcher for a number of years and I have never seen anything like this before.  I have observed other crafts and twice I've had cases of missing time.  But this sighting proves to be the most fascinating one yet! ((FOLLOW-UP REPORT FROM SAME WITNESS)) Too much distance covered in such a short time On the sepcified time and date, I witnessed an object flying at a very high rate of speed.  I was outside having a cigarette and was admiring the night sky as I often do.  I've been a sky-watcher for a number of years since my first sighting in Aug. 1991.  There were some very high, thin clouds and some airplanes visible at the time.  The object appeared from the west and moving toward the east in the direction of the moon.  After about 15 seconds, it was quite near the moon.  Then it banked a turn and moved toward the northwest.  The object appeared as though it was out of our atmosphere.  It appeared to be as high as some of the stars.  After banking toward the northwest, it slowed down considerably and then shot away after about 10 seconds.  It left no trail and there was no visible tail.  It did not appear to have the characteristics of a satellite or any known aircraft that I've ever seen!!  I have been watching the heavens since my first sighting in 1991 when my car was approached by a solid white orb and I was left with 1.5 hours of missing time...as was the passenger in my vehicle that night.  To have seen something flying that high and appearing only slightly larger than any of the other stars that were visible through the coud cover, it suggests that the object may have been quite large.  It did not twinkle like other stars and to have covered such a large area of the skies, I am inclined to believe that this was a UFO.  I am wondering if anyone in the area saw the same thing I did?

An object passed quickly through the sky with 6 circles of luminescence with absolutely no sound as it passed overhead.;2004-09-03 22:20:00;20 seconds;An object passed quickly through the sky with 6 circles of luminescence with absolutely no sound as it passed overhead. I brought my spouse outside to view the Milky Way and as we were looking up I noticed a craft passing overhead and was very excited and pointed it out to my husband.  He did not see it much in the manner as if you try and point out a shooting star to someone.   It passes so quickly. That is what happened with this object.  I saw it and pointed very excitedly but he did not see it.  I watched it pass over and saw its shape.  I knew it was not a plane or a helicopter or a satellite or anything else I am familiar with seeing.  It was definately a UFO and I am 100% certain I had an alien encounter of the second kind.  I was so certain, I also quickly sketched its shape so as not to forget.  I am very excited to ascertain if others in my area were out and viewed the same thing as I am very certain of what I saw.
