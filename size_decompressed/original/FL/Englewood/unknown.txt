2 lights moving across the sky too close to land, too fast, and in silence;2008-09-08 00:30:00;10 seconds;2 lights moving across the sky too close to land, too fast, and in silence I was outside with my girlfriend looking up at the stars. It was such a clear night sky, no clouds at all, we were just laying out in the driveway looking up. All of a sudden we see 2 lights, the brightness compared to lights on a plane, that were moving across the sky, but we heard no noise and could not make out a shape. These lights were traveling in sync with each other and I could not figure out what it was. The lights didn't flash so I don't think it was a plane, and it was completely silent, but seemed much closer than any planes should be flying. It went across the sky faster than any 'normal' plane would have. This is the first time I have ever seen anything like it. We both jumped up off the driveway and ran down the street a little to follow the lights but it went behind a tree and then just seemed to disappear. I am a 21 year old nursing student and I will be going into the United States Army as a health care specialist.  The other observer, my girlfriend, is a 17 year old high school student.  We told one of our friends that came by later that night and they thought we were joking. I have no idea what this was, but it made me think enough to write a report and hope that maybe someone else saw what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.

Two redish/orange glowing objects in the sky in Englewood, FL;2013-04-28 21:30:00;10 seconds;Two redish/orange glowing objects in the sky in Englewood, FL My wife and I were in the car on Manasota Key when we looked to the East and noticed two redish/orange glowing objects in the sky.  I could not quite tell, but there appeared to be some odd non-aviation related flashing lights as well.  There were two objects that moved slowly to the north and maybe slightly to the east.  I grew up around aviation and the slow, low movement was not that of an airplane or even that of a recognizable helicopter.  Before I realized it, they were gone.  Cloud cover was several miles to the southeast and would not have factored in their disappearance.  After checking current flights in the air, I determined they were not licensed aircraft with flight plans.  This was an event that I could not explain.;26.93742;-82.3257381818182
