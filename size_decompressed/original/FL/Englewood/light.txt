It was mabey a half a mile off the coast of manasota key, there were two red lights mabey 10 meters from eachother, moving very very slowly. the lights were very bright. Bright enough to be seen thru peripheral vision.  From the time that I first saw it to the time I lost it was about 4 and a half minutes.  It was while I was driving home, and by the time I got home and used binaculars it was gone.;26.93742;-82.3257381818182
bright stars, moving erratically, over the Gulf of Mexico;2002-08-24 01:00:00;2 months;bright stars, moving erratically, over the Gulf of Mexico I have been watching what looks like a very bright star, with a dimmer one beside it.  Both move continuously, up, down, right, left, backwards, etc,  but remaining in the same general area.  Tonight they are very high, must crane my neck, but on other times they have been lower, or in another area in the night sky.  The most unusual activity I have seen was one night when they lowered dramatically and dimmed, as a plane went overhead.  This always above the Gulf of Mexico, I watch from the shoreline, in the wee hours.  I do not know about weather equipment, satellites, etc.  It is just very interesting, and would like to know what it is.;26.93742;-82.3257381818182
A large bright light moved swiftly across the ocean after sunset suddenly stopped and didn't move any more.;2003-11-07 18:30:00;30 minutes;A large bright light moved swiftly across the ocean after sunset suddenly stopped and didn't move any more. My wife and I were fishing on Manasota Key in the Gulf of Mexico near Englewood Florida. We had been fishing most of the afternoon while waiting for the sunset. This was day 6 of a three week vacation. We had been to the beach for the sunset about every evening. It was just after the sun had gone below the ocean. The sky was clear. My wife pointed and said can you see that bright light? It's moving. I looked to the southwest in the direction she was pointing and immediately saw a light at an elevation of about 30 deg above the ocean horizion. It looked like the landing light of a large airplane. It was as large or larger than Mars was at it's closest this summer. The light was white, steady, and unblinking. It moved from the south toward the north parallel with the horizon. It looked like it could be a fast moving airplane. We watched it for about 10 to 15 seconds. It came to a complete stop without slowing, it just stopped almost due west of us (about 260 deg). We watched it for another 20 minutes and it did not move anymore. We talked about how far it had moved as we watched it. If you held up a yard stick (3 ft) in the middle at arms length, it traveled about the length of the measure in only 10 or so seconds. We looked around the clear sky and could see other lights from planes moving both high and low. All were blinking and all were closer to us than the light and moving much slower in comparison to the speed of the light. We watched two aircraft pass between us and the light in the approach to SouthWest Regional Airport at Ft. Myers. We have taken that flight several times ourselves. It was impossible to tell how big or how far the object was except it was far beyond the normal path of the aircraft and much bigger than the lights of the commerical airliners we were looking at. We finally left after half an hour and it was still there. The following Monday (11/10/03) we went back to the beach at sunset to see if the light was still there. During the same time period on the 10th, no ! light was present. We went again on the 11th (Tuesday, 11 November 2003) and after sun set, suddenly the light appeared in about the same location we saw it in on Friday after it had stopped but just a little more to the south of west (about 250 deg). We had watched the sun set and had a sense of time of setting objects. A while after the sun had set, it was completely dark, the object began to slowly sink toward the horizon until it went out of sight below the ocean level. It did not sink as fast as the sun did. The ocean horizon at a standing elevation is about 12 miles away. We did not see the light any more. It could have been in space for all we could tell. It looked like a big bright flood light. I have followed UFO reports for some years. Except for an incident in 1954 when I saw 5 silver disk the size of a new dime, at arms length, in a V formation, go over in Kentucky, I have never seen anything I could not identify. I read several other people have seen very large bright lights recently. Perhaps something similar. My wife and I are both college grad professional people.;26.93742;-82.3257381818182
Lights over Englewood Florida;2008-11-21 19:40:00;two mins;Lights over Englewood Florida At 5:40 am I took my dog out for a walk, as I turned north west I seen this very bright light, I stood there not believing what I was looking at for about 20 seconds.  I then ran inside to find a camera,cause my camera/video recorder broke last month,I was inside for about 15 seconds,after finding no camera I ran back outside.As I walked out the front door I seen the light right over my house at about 5-6000 feet,I watched it another 10-15 seconds when the light went out,and I ran in the house.This light was way to bright to be a plane or space station,this is my very first time ever seeing anything,I could not explain.I dont know how the light went from looking about 60 miles to the north west to being right over head in under 30 seconds.I dont know if anyone else seen them,I would think so,they were so bright.  thanks  also it was very clear out;26.93742;-82.3257381818182
Star like objects that change direction flash light,and speed up,and slow down.Almost every night.;2009-05-07 09:20:00;9:20-9:35;Star like objects that change direction flash light,and speed up,and slow down.Almost every night. We have been seeing these lights flying across the sky for months now. The first night me and a friend seen 10,the next week 7.  So we called a writer for our local paper that does UFO stories and invited him to come out, and watch with us.  On April 28th he came to my house in Englewood Florida on the Gulf of Mexico,and seen two UFOs. We always check NASA's j tracker,and space station tracker to make sure their not anything we know of. Tonight I went out,and seen two then seen a bright one and called my dad out,and he seen it to,it seemed to pick up speed and slow down. Then my dad went in and my brother came out,and we seen another one. They are all star like but change direction speed,one flash brighter after we shined our spot light on it,and some even move back and forth while going in straight line.

Bright colored lights of 1 object hovering in one position over Gulf of Mexico from FL.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star, possibly Sirius.  PD));2011-09-27 21:30:00;2 hours;Bright colored lights of 1 object hovering in one position over Gulf of Mexico from FL Observed bright light NW over Gulf of Mexico.  Thought it might be a bright star, but noticed flashing red, blue, white lights.  Thought it could be an airplane, but it did not move.  Then thought it could be a helicopter, but it stayed in one area without changing for almost 1 hour that we observed.  Used binoculars to see if we could detect a shape, but only could make out a close net cluster of lights flashing.  Last check, it was still hovering over the Gulf.

Lights appeared to be duplicating toward the east there was also a similer light further off to the west.  All lights appeared to fade off with in a matter of 30-60 seconds.  Noticed two more lights appear as I continued northbound past the intersection of of SR 776 and Spinnaker.  Lights were not typical lights seen in this area from passing aircraft headed to Punta Gorda or Fort Myers airports.

Bright orange lights in the sky over Englewood Florida;2011-11-03 20:05:00;6 minutes;Bright orange lights in the sky over Englewood Florida I Walked outside 11/3/11 a little after 8pm and noticed bright orange glowing lights in the sky. When I first walked outside there were 6 bright orange lights in a straight line which vanished about 30 seconds later.  Then I saw about 5 more bright orange lights appear one at a time in different areas of the sky.  They light up then vanished after about 30 seconds each time. These definatley were not planes.;26.93742;-82.3257381818182
Slowly flashing white light in space or possibly low earth orbit.;2012-10-16 03:00:00;15 minutes;Slowly flashing white light in space or possibly low earth orbit. I stepped out onto my front deck to smoke at right around 3:00 Am.  We live on the Gulf of Mexico in a beachfront home so there is less light making the stars seem to stand out more than other cities I've lived in, so when I smoke at night I always stare straight up at the stars.  Almost right away,  I noticed a bright, white light flash one time out of the corner of my eye. I tried to focus without blinking on the area that the flash seemed to originate from and waited.  Finally after what seemed like an eternity, I saw it again!  Only this time, I was looking right at it when it flashed.  The light was so far up, that it appeared to be a star.  It appeared to be stationery at first, and was located near the Southwest corner of the constellation Orion.  After the second flash, I pulled up the stop watch application on my smartphone and began to time the spacing between flashes.  To the best of my ability, I timed it to exactly 7 seconds between flashes. I went inside quickly to ask my Fiancee if she would get out of bed and come outside to look at this light.  Luckily, she wasn't mad at me for waking her because we had seen the same sort of light last winter in the same exact location in the sky.  The only difference is the last time, the light flashed twice and was gone. The skies were completely clear, on both occasions, and the light  was so far away, the only way I can think to describe it is by comparing it to a star, that only shines for a half second every 7 seconds. The only thing that makes this worth reporting, is the incredible altitude at which it appeared to be coming from. I truly believe this object was in either low earth orbit, or in space. After watching the object and timing the frequency of the flashing for some time, I began to realize that it was actually moving, just very, very slow. After around 15 minutes, the object had moved a little less than the distance between the star furthest to the right of Orion's belt, and the center star in Orion's belt. Although it was actually located off of the Southwest corner of Orion, the distance between the stars in Orion's belt was the closest point of reference in determining the distance of travel. And given the very short distance the object travelled over a 15 minute period, this to me, has to be something other than an aircraft because I have never in my entire life seen an aircraft even half that high, and never have I seen an airplane that could fly that slow. The other thing that made me report this sighting, is the very slow, 7 second interval at which the light was flashing.  All the aircraft I have seen have marker lights and a strobe light. Whatever this was not only had no marker lights, but you could hardly consider this light a strobe purely because the period between flashes was so long, and the strangest fact of all, the fact that after about 15 minutes, it simply vanished and did not reappear.  And since the sky was perfectly clear and I could see every star and planet in the sky, the object could not have been obscured by a cloud.   I hope someone can look into this and check weather radar, air traffic radar, and find out if it could have been a satellite of some kind, or possibly even some military drone or experimental aircraft.;26.93742;-82.3257381818182
Bright green light appears, moves slowly for 2-4sec, and thrusts itself into the distance disappearing.;2013-03-21 22:15:00;~5 seconds;Bright green light appears, moves slowly for 2-4sec, and thrusts itself into the distance disappearing. I was Riding my bike home from work tonight, it was about 10:15pm (22:15-24hr) and the sky was clear.  My neighborhood isn't lit very well so the only lights around were my bicycle headlight and the moonlight.  To my right about as low as a plane beginning to land and brighter than any star in the area, a bright green light appeared. It moved with no smoke trail about as fast as a regular passenger aircraft for about 2-4 seconds, then appeared to have thrust trails for less than a second and disappeared into the distance.  The speed was beyond anything I have ever seen or heard of, my headphones were in and playing full blast so there is no sound to report.  There seem to be other reports of a hovering green light in the area around the same time but from my research so far none of the sightings have seemed to be as brief as this one was. I hope whatever it is will show up again soon. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));26.93742;-82.3257381818182
One round ball of fire - gliding through the sky at Manasota Key, FL;2015-02-04 18:35:00;30 seconds;one round ball of fire - gliding through the sky at Manasota Key, FL At approx. 6:35pm, Wed, Feb 4, I was walking the dog at the beach on Manasota Key.  (about 1/8 mile north of the Charlotte County line in Sarasota County).  I looked toward the south and saw a bright orange ball of “fire.”  The color looked as if an airplane was on fire, gliding slowly in the sky from south to north.   It took a slight turn to the east and descended slightly, then turned back to the west and kept it’s slow, gliding motion to the north.  As it traveled north up the beach the orange fireball got smaller, until, eventually, it went dark. When I first noticed the ball, it was about the size of a quarter (if the quarter were right in front of my eyes) and stayed that size for about 20 seconds.  The last 10 seconds it gradually became smaller, but the brightness stayed the same, until it was the size of the tip of a sharp pencil, and then went dark. It was very eery.  No sound whatsoever. I am a 60 year old female - retired business owner - well traveled.;26.93742;-82.3257381818182
