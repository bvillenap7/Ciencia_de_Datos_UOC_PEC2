I was heading into the house and then seen another moving in the same direction. I had my friend come out to see and, as the first it slowly disappeared. We went back inside and I looked out the window and noticed 2 more going in the same direction, so we watched them slowly disappear. after going back inside again, peeked out and seen 1 more all going the same direction and fading away as if they went out to space..

We were having dinner in Englewood, when my wife said what is that?  I turned and looked and saw a fireball.;2016-04-09 21:00:00;3 minutes;We were having dinner at a wine bistro restruant in englewood fl when my wife said what is that?  I turned and looked and saw a fireball moving from east to west.  We were dinning outside on a very clear night. You could see the flames in this fireball as it moved across the sky.  Many people watched this fireball until it disappeared.  Then came another fireball in the same path as the first one.  it was hard to tell how high or how fast it was moving.  But I would say it was under 3000 ft. It seemed to pick up speed as we watched it silently fade away!  I'm sure it wasn't a plane, helicopter, shooting star, or weather balloon .;26.93742;-82.3257381818182
