6 amber circles traveling horizontally, following each other in a straight line, then disappeared;2011-11-03 18:50:00;20 sec;6 amber circles traveling horizontally, following each other in a straight line, then disappeared I saw 6 amber-colored circles, not flashing, traveling from west to east in the southern sky, just above the horizon.  They looked to be following each other.  Shortly after I noticed them, they just disappeared.  Then, 2 more came up from the horizon, heading straight up, got just above the tree line, and then disappeared.;26.93742;-82.3257381818182
Round bright orange solid ligh & no sound.;2013-07-07 23:00:00;2 minutes;Round bright orange solid ligh & no sound It was about 11:00 pm & I was drive home from picking up my grandson from work when I got out the car, I saw a bright round orange light in the southeastern sky heading west & it did not make a sound & was not blinking but solid & almost came over my house & it sped up very fast because the light became very dim quickly & disappeared way up past the stars within seconds.  The total time approximately maybe 2 minutes, at the most. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));26.93742;-82.3257381818182
