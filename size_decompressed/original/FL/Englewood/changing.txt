I saw it when I was driving my friend home and he actually saw it first and then pointed it out to me.  we were driving straight towards it and it was very high in the sky.  it was almost a doughnut shape but after we saw it,  it begin to almost disappear but from top to bottom and slowly. it was almost a kinda bright orange similar to a streetlight but much larger and not as bright.  I could also see the stars and there were no clouds in that direction which was SE according to my car compass.  it took as much space in the sky as if you held a quarter about a foot from your face.;26.93742;-82.3257381818182
