Low fying and flashing with no noise.;2013-07-28 23:00:00;1 minute;Low fying and flashing with no noise. Low flying. Flashing green and red with solid white light. The craft was moving in an odd manor which got our attention.  The the craft moved towards us and flew right past us very close and low to the ground. It was silent. I asked my neighbor who pulled up at the time it was over head what he thought it was and his guess was mosquito helicopter. I thought it was a helicopter too until I realized it was so close and making no noise.  The craft then came to a stand still in the tree line and went straight down within a few hundred feet of our home. we went out front to try and spot it again but there was nothing. I have blurry video of the craft on a cell phone but the video does not do this craft justice.  It was quite close and the phone would not focus.
