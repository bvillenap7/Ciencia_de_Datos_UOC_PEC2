Bright Metallic Sphere Flies Over Florida Prison;2002-07-25 09:20:00;1minute sev sec;Bright Metallic Sphere Flies Over Florida Prison I was incarcerated at Polk Correctional Inst for 3yrs.   In the summer of 2002 July 25th 2002, at 9:20a.m., I was standing with two friends at the corner of our library near O.I.C's office.   While talking to a (witness) out the corner of my eye something flashed and caught my attention.  The object at first, I assumed may be an airliner catching the morning sun was coming in fast from the southern sky.  As it got closer I could very well tell it was no aircraft that I've ever seen.   I started pointing at it and asking him to look at it to.  At that point the other witness was interested in what I was pointing at and looked to.  It appeared to be a perfectly shaped sphere: Blue in color, but like shiny metal at the same time. The object made no sound and went from horizon to horizon in seconds making no noise.  At the speed it was going you would think that even a sonic boom or something would have been heard.  We talked about it all day that day. The Sat, July 27th, 2002, in the afternoon my friend that witnessed it with me brought me a news clip from the ledger stating that 2 Jets chased mystery object over Washington on Friday July 26th 2002 describing what we'd seen to the T.  It freaked me out something serious.   Believe it or not, I still have the news clip as to never forget what I saw that early morning.;28.1987;-81.8083
Blue sphere of light flashes on 1-4 and zoomed down.;2013-11-28 01:50:00;10 seconds;Blue sphere of light flashes on 1-4 and zoomed down We were driving on 1-4 on the way to Tampa, then saw the whole sky flash blue then a blue sphere of light zoomed down.  It was very fast and as we kept driving the next electric billboard was broken-- kind of like the static on a tv screen.;28.1987;-81.8083
