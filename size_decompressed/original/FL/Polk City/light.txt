As it got closer to my location I could tell that it was at an altitude consistent with a commercial airliner or possibly at a higher altitude. I waited to see the blinking strobe lights that jets have but I did not have that. The light was very bright and as it was passing overhead and continuing in a Northeast direction the bright light remained the same as it passed well beyond me and then all of a sudden I saw a flash and it went to total darkness. There was not a cloud in the sky and I live out in the country with very little artificial light interference as I can see the Milky Way very well. I believe whatever this UFO was either cloaked itself or accelerated so fast that it disappeared in an instant. I have seen several questionable objects in the sky here over the past 23 years I have lived here. This event really moved me and I continued to scan the sky for ! almost 30 minutes hoping it would return. I am a firm believer that extraterrestrials have been visiting us since ancient history and are still visiting us. I wish someone else in this area witnessed what I did and possibly reported to someone;28.1987;-81.8083
