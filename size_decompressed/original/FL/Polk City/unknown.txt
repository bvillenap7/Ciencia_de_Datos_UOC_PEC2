Starting on September 28, 2012, my Husaband and I spotted a very bright, very colored object in the sky due West of our house.  We sit on our front porch at night and it really caught our eye.  We kept watching it and after about an hour, it started moving further West, at a very slow speed.  We watched it until we could no longer see it. Today is October 1st, and I now see 4, possibly 5 of them.  They seem to appear right around 8:00 p.m, the first one leaves at about 9:10 p.m. and the others seem to slowly move West about 30 minutes later.  They are a beautiful sight through binoculars, wish we had a telescope to get a better look.  They are here as I type.  I really encourage you to check this out.  Our house faces WEST and we are in central Florida.  The different objects are aligned pretty far from each other, but in the same coordinates!!!;28.1987;-81.8083
