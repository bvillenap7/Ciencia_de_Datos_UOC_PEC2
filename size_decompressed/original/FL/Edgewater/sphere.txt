Fire from the sky;2005-09-16 19:20:00;30 seconds;Fire from the sky A ball of fire was reported and made the news. I have seen this ball of fire several times over the years. Usually appears during a hurricane of after a shuttle launch. On this one, the ball of fire was slowly falling from the sky. About the same speed as the space shuttle launches. Three lights fell with if then stopped while the ball of fire hit the ocean. The ball of fire was falling too slow to be a typical metorite. Plan on getting this on video.
