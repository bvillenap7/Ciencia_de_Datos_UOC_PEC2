Orange Glowing ball traveling silently approximately 1500 feet along interstate.;2014-07-04 22:00:00;1:30;Orange Glowing ball traveling silently approximately 1500 feet along interstate. While viewing neighborhood fireworks my wife and I observed a Glowing Orange ball of light heading towards our location.  As there was a lull in the fireworks ,We had noticed the absence of noise from the ball.   Coincidently a Cessna had taken off from our local airport nearer to us than the object but was oblivious to the glowing object.  It was apparent that the ball was further from us than the plane and the ball was making a sweeping turn to the north following Interstate 95.   We continued to observe the object as it faded out of view due to tall trees and low clouds obscuring our view. My wife captured the object on her IPhone and our narrative.;28.9790376947045;-80.9105588785043
