V-shaped aircraft, looked like a bird, in Edgewater Florida;2001-11-09 20:24:00;1 minute;V-shaped aircraft, looked like a bird, in Edgewater Florida I was outside aligning my satellite dish moving it, when i looked up, and right above me i seen a something wierd, at first I thought it was a flock of birds flying lit up but that is impossible cause its dark out, the lights moved closer to each other and moved away making a V-shape,like a big bird flapping it's wings, this is the first time i've ever seen anything like this. It did not make a sound either. The thing that freaked me out the most was that there were 3 planes i heard right after i seen the craft. I dont even belive in ufo's but im not sure now. if anyone else seen this, it was in Edgewater Florda at 8:20 pm on 11/09/01.. please email me at ((address deleted)) or if u ever seen a craft like this, or know if its a new aircraft let me know.;28.9790376947045;-80.9105588785043
