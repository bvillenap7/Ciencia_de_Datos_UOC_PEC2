Six adults in our fifties, three men, three women, all saw a glowing orange cigar shaped object moving steadily in a straight line, parallel to the ground, from south to north.   We were standing on my west facing, second story level lanai.  It was level with us, around 100 yards away, 10 to 20 feet long and 5 to 10 feet tall/wide.   It was totally silent, and suddenly blinked out/disappeared as it was approaching the north edge of our sight line.;26.8334;-82.2624
