I walked out from under the overhang of my trailer to look. It seemed to be following something because of the way it was flying. it would go to one spot, stand still for a minute, and then go to another spot. I noticed that it had to be following something flying in that way. I figured that it was chasing a car, but I happen to look up and across in the opposite direction of the helicopter. That is when I saw long cigar shape white or light-colored things flying in the sky. At first, I thought maybe it's Birds. then, I thought of drones but they had to have been huge because they were very high in the sky. They made no noiser. That is when they floated from one side of the Horizon across the sky the other side of the Horizon and just disappeared over the tops of the trees. I was watching while they were in a straight line at first. Then two went instead of one right in front of the other two, but perfect! ly  spaced, flew in front of the other two  but were offset exactly from the other two. Flying across the sky, they then started going one in front of the other in a diagonal line and they were in perfect format and perfectly in sync with each other. That is when I thought to myself I'm going to report this.and That's when the helicopter followed them in the same direction. Then, It was over. I heard the helicopter for about 20 minutes longer, I did not see neither the UFOs or the Helicopter.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
