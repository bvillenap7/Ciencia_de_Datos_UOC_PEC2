Dimmed orange lights in formation of a half circle--six lights in semi-circle with one light in center of semi-circle;1998-09-13 23:10:00;6 seconds;Dimmed orange lights in formation of a half circle--six lights in semi-circle with one light in center of semi-circle The craft moved much too fast for known aircraft. It shimmered as it moved from north to south towards Sarasota. There was no sound. The stars appeared to be beyond the shape. I lost sight of it as trees obscurred the horizon. I happened to be gazing up at the night sky when it passed by.  This is my first sighting of any unknown craft.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
Sighting of seven flying star looking objects during Leonid Metor Shower;2002-11-19 05:30:00;1:30 HOURS;Sighting of seven flying star looking objects during Leonid Metor Shower My daughter and I had gotten up to watch and file the metor shower this morning for her sicence project we were facing North East of the Sarasota-Bradenton International airport in Sarasota Florida--which we live about 1 mile north of the airport.  In the process of watching the sky my daughter thought she saw a star move across the sky.  She asked me to look and to my surprise I also saw what appeared to be a star moving across the sky.  It was not a shooting star because it did not seem to be falling but moving in a horizontal direction over the sky.  As we were watching this happen we saw another object, that also looked like a star moving towards the first object.  We continued watching and proceeded to notice several of these star looking objects moving all around.  They appeared to stay in pairs except for one that stayed seperate from the others.  As we watched them move we saw them come to abrupt stops in mid-flight and seem to be suspended in air.  They would make right angle turns and also appeared to be doing 360 circles within there air space.  They were not spinning in one spot but literally doing a full circle in the area and would go from that motion into either a 90 degree turn or shoot straight across the sky.  They almost appeared to be dancing across the sky but always within what seemed to be their area of space and in pairs except for the lone star.  It was simply amazing.  My daughter and I woke my husband up and he too came out and saw the phenomena.  My husband was in the Marines for several years and I know that there is nothing yet that can make such amazing movements and seem to suspend in air after a immediate stop in mid-movement.  These object did not fly down or come even remotely close for us to see them as anything more than waht appeared as stars that moved. My family has never in our life seen anything that we would even say has come close to a UFO so we are not used to this, admittedly we were a little freaked out yet completely amazaed and unafriad. I have always beleived that it is very arrogant to have the frame of mind that in all the vast spanse of space the earth is the only place where life of any form can be found so I do think that what I saw is for real and not something from this planet.  I just feel priviliged that I now have a personal experience with this type of phenomena.  I can only hope that we were able to catch it on video--I am only worried that they were so far up in the atmosphere that it will not show up.  I will be checking tonight when I get home from work.

3 objects that were very odd in color and moved quickly and then hovered at times.  Bright flashes of light as each disappeared.;2003-11-15 17:30:00;3-5 minutes;3 objects that were very odd in color and moved quickly and then hovered at times.  Bright flashes of light as each disappeared. At approximately 1730, while I was driving on SR64, my daughter (15) asked me what that was in the sky?  I looked up and saw an offwhite type of object that appeared to be slim. It was pretty far up.  The object was moving when I saw it and then stopped in mid air.  My daughter then pointed out another object and my other daughter also saw one for a total of 3.  I have no idea what they were, but I've never seen an object move that fast and then stop and come to a hover.  A moment later, there was a bright flash and the object that I originally saw was gone followed by two more flashes in sequence and the other two objects were gone.  My daughters immediately felt as if the flash was some type of communication between the objects as they happened in sequence. ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the year of the sighting is 2003, and we have amended the date above.  PD));27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308

My mom and I were looking at the moon and seeing where the planets were. These two things just showed up that are misty grey sorta and looked like racing or speeding together towards us at first and then they crisscrossed back anf forth. They were silent and there was no sound around them there was a brown sorta color or haze around them. They hung out near the baseball park for a minute and they took off and my mom saw them and called me over and they went down to the left together doing the same thing. they crisscross once in a while and then were right near each other going really really really fast. There were no lights on either one of them. They were moving up and down, right in front of us. Last i saw them they were heading down towards Sarasota when i went to get my brother and my grandmother. ((NUFORC Note:  Son's report of same sighting.  Please see illustration from witnesses on the NUFORC homepage.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Second report from son.

My mom and I saw 2 things that were grey in a brown haze. They were going really fast and moved up and down faster then a plane was going. They came under the moon near the Bay at Pamls Sola. No sound coming from them it was very quiet outside. They were going over the baseball park and the park lights were shining bright and they stopped near the park for a few seconds and flew over again in fron t of us and then went to Sarasota and I went it to get my brothe r and grandmother.They always were together except sometimes one woould fly out away from the other one and get sucked back near the other one like magnets pulling metal but sometimes it had resistence.

bright orange dancing lights over bradenton;2008-07-05 00:00:00;approx.15 min;bright orange dancing lights over bradenton Approx.12am on July 5 my family members neighbors and myself noticed 2 bright orange objects in the north western skies over bradenton florida. As we were watching the objects.two more appeared from the west.The objects were a bright orange in color. They would move from side to side and up and down. After observing the objects thur binocolus it appeared that the objects were crescent shaped. All together we saw 12 objects all being of the same color and same crescent shaped. When the objects left they went straight up and the majority went toward the west and at least two of them went toward the south. The only way that I know how to describe the objects were like they were dancing in the sky. But when they left they left in a hurry... We were unable to get any pictures of them for some reason they would not show up in the camera. I know that this sounds strange but this is what me my family and my neighbors saw. Thank you for your time..Oh yes the back ground was dark;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
Dim object going north to south, not lighted, no lights or sound.;2008-09-22 00:10:00;10 seconds;Dim object going north to south, not lighted, no lights or sound. Note: This will amend my first report. I said 50 degrees, it should be 150 degrees. Slightly after midnight, Sept, 22. I saw a whitish shape emerge from the skyglow to the north, simular to the artist rendering in graphic-1. It was the size of a silver dollar at arms length. My first thought was, that's a very big bird!. In a matter of seconds it was overhead and I realized it wasn't flapping or moving as a bird would, just a steady movement to the south. Graphic-2 depicts what it looked liked overhead. When it was overhead it was much dimmer and had no lights or sound whatsoever. There was some kind of disturbance or disturbed air in a short wake to the rear. It took 10 seconds to go from the skyglow to the north and disappearing in the skyglow to the south, about 50 degrees. I realized that if this was a bird at low level it would have passed to the east at just above roof top level, assuming 500 to 1000 foot altitude. This would be 30 to 60 mph, and with no flapping movement - not a bird. If it was a plane high enough so as not to be heard then it was flying without lights and would have been MASSIVE in size.  Simply, I'm stumped!;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
Two bright lights racing across the clear blue sky;2010-02-18 12:39:00;5 minutes;Two bright lights racing across the clear blue sky Two bright white dots racing across the sky from west to east. It was a clear blue sky day, a cold front had just passed through the day before. I observed two bright dots and raised my Nikon D300 to photograph it. I had just finished shooting my late Uncle and his roadster car outside and glanced up to see the dots racing across the sky. The lens I had on the camera was not a telephoto, so the focal length was not ideal, and I did not have time to change lenses. I just shot the picture and looked at it later on the computer. I will email jpeg photo to your email address below.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
Bradenton,FL 3 reddish dots in the eastern sky;2010-12-12 02:30:00;10 mins;Bradenton,FL 3 reddish dots in the eastern sky This event happened earlier this morning and please let me convey that I have a degree in aviaton tecnology, and I  am an ameteur astonomer so I hope it lends some credibility to this statement. I exited my house at about 0230 on december 12,2010 looking east, and I saw three reddish/orange dots in the eastern  sky.  The position of these dots would form the corners of a triangle with the two corners on the bottom.   I  proceeded to start yelling for anyone that could help verify, but no one responded at this time.  While yelling the  bottom right dot started to move toward the upper right dot while the left dot remainded stationary.   The two dots  them came close together then the whole formation seemed to head east, and that is when I finally ran inside and  summonded my friend Brent who came to see the end of the first event pluse the second event also. Brent and I together witnessed the lights disappear in the east in the formation specified...this ends the first  event. Following the first event, Brent and I discussed the options and possibilites of what we has just witnessed for a  little while before he decided to retire inside while I still watched the early morning sky.   After about 30 minutes  lights once again graced the eastern sky....i summoned Brent and he summoned Kathey who would be the third witness  to tonights events.   The second event consisted of about seven objects in the eastern sky positioned side by  side  each other, slightly above the horizen with 2 of the objects on the right being very close to each other. I believe  this was object number 3and4 from the right.   Once again the objects seemed to slowly disappear in the eastern sky  after several minutes.  This was witnessed by myself, brent, and kathy. I am finishing this statement now at 04:24aM on 12/12/2010.  I just came back from checking aagin with no sign of the objects in question.  Venus has risen in the eastern sky, but from where I spotted the objects they would have been to the left/north of venus.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
Unexplained Sighting Over BRADENTON, FL *January 14th, 2016  7:20 a.m *;2016-01-14 07:20:00;2-3 minutes;Unexplained Sighting Over BRADENTON, FL *January 14th, 2016  7:20 a.m * I was driving from Clearwater to Cape Coral for business, early on the morning of January 14th, 2016, and headed southbound on Interstate 75.  It was a particularly clear sky that morning, I recall, as I had been on the road before the sun had even begun to rise.    About 10 minutes after getting over the Sunshine Skyway, I kept thinking I noticed something out of the corner of my eye, to the SW of my present position.  Because the Tampa airport is so close, MacDill AFB, and many private air fields, I normally wouldn't think twice about anything in the sky but it seemed unusual.   The road took a slight bend, and the treeline disappeared, allowing for a much more clear view towards where I was noticing something.  I then saw what I would have to assume was 2 lights?  It was too far from me to decipher much, and I was going 70 mph, but it seemed stationary.  Considering that perhaps my rate of travel was off-setting the stationary appearance of the object, I moved into the right lane so I could slow down to see it more clearly.  The object moved in a pattern that formed a small vertical circle, but did so very quickly.  Judging by the distance, it was atypical for anything I have seen to date.   It did this several more times, while intermittently flashing light(s) so bright, it seemed difficult to tell if it was so bright that it appeared blue, or was alternating more than one light with various hues.   It then moved about 25 degrees to the south in what seemed like the blink of an eye, before vanishing so fast that it left a silver hazy streak behind.  The streak disappeared within a second or so, but as a first time observer of an object such as this, all I could do was close my mouth.   I have never experienced anything remotely close to this, nor have I been aware of any manned/unmanned craft capable of such precise movement, at such a high rate of speed.   I am more than happy to come forward, answering any further questions with regard to the subject.   Thank you for your time and attention towards this matter.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
One multicolored floating sparkplug gave birth to 6 soft white, un flapping birds in a half moon line sped across the early morning sky;2016-09-20 05:15:00;10 minutes;One multicolored floating sparkplug gave birth to 6 soft white, un flapping birds in a half moon line sped across the early morning sky This morning around 5:15 I was sitting outside on our backyard patio. It was a clear night sky littered with many stars.  As I shifted my weight on the patio chair, a large shape could be seen to the northeast. It flashed red and green and appeared to have the shape of a spark plug.  At first I thought it might be a helicopter hovering. But there was no movement in any direction nor did it make a sound or appear at a low enough altitude. I watched it for the better part of 10 minutes when suddenly there appeared six soft white shapes that ballooned outwards from the original flashing lights.  This new creation reminded me of a flock of birds falling into a half moon shape rather than the traditional V.  The speed at which these six new un flapping, soft white/grey birds moved in perfect synchronicity  was astounding!  I couldn't take my eyes off them!  They moved quickly across the sky in a perfect line until they were out of sight.  And when I returned my gaze to the original craft, it was gone. Originally I hoped to find a report on this same anomaly.  I guess there aren't many sky watchers at that hour of the morning.  I'm still pinching myself over this sighting.  I was almost hoping these birds were a new breed of night flyers who don't need to flap their wings while covering vast distances at break neck speed.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
I was walking my dog about 1am on August 1, 2017 in my complex.;2017-08-01 01:00:00;<20 seconds;I was walking my dog about 1am on August 1, 2017 in my complex. I noticed some nifty looking clouds that were brighter then others so I got my smartphone out to record them. Approximately 37 seconds into recording the sky, this bright blue blob that resembled a doughnut shape appeared out of thin air, above me to the left, of where I was shooting. It flashed several bright colors ranging from light blue to indigo as it wobbled across the sky blinking in and out sight untill it instantly vanished out of the atmosphere. I went through the recording many times in slow motion and took screen shots from my phone of this thing. I can attach the video clip of this and/or pictures I extracted from the video. It was strange because I continued recording (atleast I thought) but the video abruptly shut off like 10 seconds after it first appeared. It was almost 2 years ago but I remember clearly it was small, but extremely bright.  It looked like a light blue ball of plasma with a dark blue center in the middle (like a doughnut);27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
