One white/red light hovering over Bradenton, FL. - posted 1/7/14.;2014-01-01 01:45:00;10 mins.;1/1/14 - 1:45 - Bradenton, FL - Egg shape - duration 10 minutes -  one white/red light hovering over Bradenton, FL. - posted 1/7/14. When I returned home at 1:40am from watch service at church, I saw this light between trees in my back yard.  The light was shaped like an egg.  The object  flashed like a strobe light.  The top 2/3 of the shape flashed white while the bottom was flashing red.  The two colors flashed together.  The object hovered.  I observed it for about 10 minutes.  When I turned my head to call someone to see the light in the sky, it was gone.  At that time I went inside very quickly and talked about what was seen.  I posted my sighting on Face Book to see if anyone saw the light in my area.  Someone wrote that others in Bradenton, FL.  Saw lights in the sky. When I saw this object in the dark sky,  I had a strange feeling go through my body.  I knew there weren't any lights in our area and it had to be a UFO.  I do not know how long it was hovering in the sky.  Wow!  I never thought that I would see something that could not be explained. I am a female teacher.
