Bright white light. Not plane, planet or star;2002-07-31 06:20:00;1 minute;Bright white light. Not plane, planet or star On the way to work this morning with my husband I noticed a very bright light just below the moon.  The light was stationary and we were traveling east at about 30mph.  At first I thought that it was a star or planet, but it was just too large and very bright. I also thought that perhaps it was a plane, there is an airport about 5 miles from where we were, but it was too high to be in the flight pattern,on an inbound, or just after takeoff. There where no beacon lights so I honestly didn't believe it to be a plane,  I looked at it for moment and thought to look and see if the sun was coming up and possibly causing some sorta reflection.  The sun was still low in the horizon.  This took took perhaps a split second, when I looked back at the moon again the light was gone.  My husband pulled over to the side of the road to see if it had traveled over the top of the jeep we were riding in.  It was gone.  If it was  a plane, there is no way that it could of landed that quickly from such a high altitude.  I have looked around the internet to try to find an explaination to this, but the closest that I can come up with is the star Sirius, but from what I can tell, it is not near the moon at this time.  I have never seen a ufo (not saying this was one)and am not a person that sits around looking for them.  I just thought that this was just a very strange occurance. Any thoughts?;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
Fast moving light changing directions immediately;2007-01-14 23:00:00;30 seconds;Fast moving light changing directions immediately At around 11:00 PM EST, my brother and I saw a light in the Southern Sky (Bradenton, Florida) as we were walking to his car.   It was a light that was moving at an extremely fast speed and changing directions immediately--it was taking 90 degree turns immediately, stop, then continue making incredible sharp turns---it made no noise.   We were quite shocked by all this, and I only wish I had enough time to take a video of it all--the unidentiifed object disapeared heading WEST towards the beaches (Gulf of Mexico);27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
Two star like lights, one moving towards the other,  dissappears,now that I look again, the other one is gone too.;2007-06-25 21:30:00;10-20 seconds;Two star like lights, one moving towards the other,  dissappears,now that I look again, the other one is gone too. The object looked like it was a star because it looked exactly like the bright star it was sitting next to.  It was nightime and no clouds and I thought to myself that I can't remember ever seeing them to stars like that together.  So I looked back up and it was moving way too fast to be any jet or plane.  It was moving toward the star.  At the time I though it was just a plane but realized it was moving too fast so I looked back up and it was gone.  From the time I seen it to the time it dissappeared was about ten seconds.  I'v seen meteors fly by before but this was slow but too fast to be a jet.  I thought a satalite was falling.  But now that I think about it I don't see the star that it was flying towards either.  I think the star dissappeared too.  Let me go outside and check if I can see the star that it was flying towards.  No, I don't.  This is wierd.   I seriously think that if that wasn't a meteor that it had to of been a u.f.o.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
Early morning sighting of 3 triangular shaped lights. One changed position. Together moving quickly southeast;2009-09-23 06:15:00;about 1 minute;Early morning sighting of 3 triangular shaped lights. One changed position. Together moving quickly southeast At approximately 06:15, while outside with the dog, I observed a dim to moderately bright yellowish light approaching from the north. As we live near an airport I at first thought it to be a plane. As it got closer it became a triangle shape of 3 lights. The lights were spaced too far apart to be any type of aircraft. When it was almost overhead it turned sharply to the East. I could then see that the 3 lights were slightly oval in shape, brighter in the center, dimming with a slight haze to the outside. As it (they) continued east the light in the right rear quickly moved to the left past the left light then back into position leading me to believe it was not a single object with three lights but three objects. The group then turned southeast and slowly faded. These were traveling faster than an aircraft would appear to be but much slower than a meteor. There was absolutely no sound. The sky was clear, no clouds, and no fog. I had a perfectly clear view. Th! e altitude was difficult to ascertain due to the size of the objects with nothing to compare but possibly 30-50k feet is likely.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308

Once I arrived home I saw the same lights blinking slowly then faster heading west then turning S.E at the same altitude.  Lights went approximately 5 miles SW near I-75 in Bradenton and has been hovering with lights flashing.  There was no sound and I have enough aircraft knowledge to know this wasn’t an aircraft, or helicopter.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
