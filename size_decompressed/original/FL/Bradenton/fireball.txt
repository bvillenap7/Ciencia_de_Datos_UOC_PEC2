a most spectacular sighting over central florida;1999-11-22 23:30:00;2-3 min;a most spectacular sighting over central florida while heading s/e/ in the north side of bradenton. a brilliant orange ball with a tail was seen. the sky was crystal clear and a full moon was visable to the north. the ball was 1/2 the size of the full moon.  it had a tail that was the length of your hand closed.  it was headed up at a 45 degree angle and to the south east.  it changed to a dark red and immediately reversed direction to the north on a horizontal plane. the tail was now angled 45 degree's back to the s/e and down.  there was a bright white flash and the color of the ball changed to blue.  there was now a white cone around the ball oposite the direction of travel.  it appeared to have dropped components ( shields?) the tail had dissapeared at this point.  it again changed directions and headed away and up from it's last direction.  it got smaller and started to flash rapidly between blue to white .  it then flashed, doubled it's size and white lazer lights appeared from the sides.  it then dissapeared from sight behind the trees. the sighting took two to three minutes to play out.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
Waiting for the lunar eclipse at Bishop planetarium,I noticed it in the sky due east and didn`'t realize it wasn't a plane at first.;2000-01-20 21:30:00;app. 1 min.;Waiting for the lunar eclipse at Bishop planetarium, I noticed it in the sky due east and I didn't realize it wasn't a plane at first. On the night of the lunar eclipse, a friend and I went to the Bishop planetarium to observe it.  They had set up many lg. and sm. telescopes to see the event.  All of them were trained either on Saturn, Jupiter or the moon.   The night was chilly and very breezy and they had set up an area apart from the 'scopes with tables and chairs and partial cover to sit out of the wind.  My friend and I had been sitting there for a few min., I was facing east, she west.    Approx. 9:30 p.m., I was looking at the east sky and noticed a red light thru the branches of a palm tree on the edge of the property.  At first I thought it was a tower light.  Then I noticed it was moving and thought perhaps it was a plane.   When it cleared the top of the tree I noticed it had a tail behind it and at that point remarked to my friend, Look at that.   She turned and exclaimed, What the hell is that?!  This was echoed by the other three people sitting near us, a mother and her two teenage sons.   The five of us watched this red ball of light for approx. a minute.  It seemed to be heading southwest.  After that the tail disappeared and it turned dullish white and seemed to change its direction to a much more West.  Then suddenly it was gone, but only for a few seconds.  It came back in the same spot it had been and continued on for a few more seconds then disappeared.   After talking about it for a couple of minutes between us, I walked over to the group by the 'scopes and asked random people if any of them had seen it.  No one had.  They had all been looking at the moon or planets.   I find this really ironic because had someone with one of the smaller 'scopes seen they could have gotten a real good look at it.   Also the local television crews were there covering the eclipse.  THE OBJECT:  It looked approx. (proportion in sky) to be about 1 and 1/2 cent, with a tail about the same length.  It was reddish/orange in color then dull white.   It never glowed like a distress flare and definitly wasn't one.  Also it traveled over land not water.  It also was not a meteorite.  I have watched the last 3 showers and others before that it didn't even vaguely resemble one.   The entire event only lasted a couple of minutes, 1 of the min.  I didn't know what I was looking at, the other min. with the five of us observing and still not knowing.    MY FRIEND AND I:  She is a retired plastics molding machine operator and I am a registered LPÑ in good standing.   PETER, I talked to you last night 2-17 about 3am.  Here’s the promised report.  I spoke to my friend and she will probably send a report of her own in the next day or two.   You can reference it by the name FLORIDA SIGHTING. For the next questions:  The object glowed about the same as a dim star.  It had a tail but did not leave any kind of trail.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308

I then turned to the east  and looked at the sky to see a red object with a tail across the sky suddenly lost the tail,turned white,blinked and disappeared.There were about60-75 other people there but only the 5 of us saw it. one object with a tail was seen by 5 people, myself, my friend,and 3 other people in the eastern sky moving quickly,dropped the tail turned white blinked twice and disapppeared.Whatis ironic is that we were at Bishop PLanitarium for the luner eclipse with a news crew and all and they were just looking at a different area of the sky. My friend got up after seeing this to talk to people but I just knew the other people were too involved in looking at the planets and did not see the object we saw zooming across the sky.My friend is a nurse and I am a retired machinist.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308

4 Orange/red balls of light flying through the sky;2009-01-01 01:10:00;1 minute;4 Orange/red balls of light flying through the sky Just after midnight we were outside by the fire ready to come inside to watch a movie just after celebrating the new year.  As we were picking up, we saw a bright orange/red ball that we thought was a New Years firework, but it didn't die out.  They came in a cluster of 2.  We watched all 4 balls go across the sky..still waiting to see them die out, but they disappeared behind the trees.  There was no sound and they went at a steady pace.  The most eerie thing we've ever seen.  We all looked at each other and said..we are all seeing this..right?  I took pics with my cell phone, but they just looked like stars.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
3-6 a.m.,  was a red-orange-sunlike round sphere go by, then up, then into field. I was scared to go in field?;2012-10-27 15:00:00;5-7 seconds;3-6am,  was a red-orange-sunlike round sphere go by, then up, then into field. I was scared to go in field? Everyone kind of just dismissed that I saw this redish orange fireball in the sky early saturday morning. I am not sure on the exact time, it was still dark out.  It was around 3am-6am, not sure-I did not write down anything about what I saw that morning?  I am sure someone people don't believe what we saw! I actually had a hard time processing it myself. Saturday I hardly remembered seeing it? Then I looked up in the sky and I could see it again run through my head!  I got online and realized more like myself have seen the same thing, Thank God-I am not alone! Makes you want to find more people that saw it too. Here is my sighting... I was outside on the back porch looking right in the direction of it!!! I witnessed it do something really strange! It was just going right through a couple of tree's. I immediately stood up and jumped on a chair to see it over the fence. Once standing I saw it going in a straight line, it had to be flying low because I could see it sitting down. I watched it go through the tree's then it made a very sharp turn up and back down-Almost like a 90 degree angle, then back down to the ground, field.  Then I did not see it anymore. My family thinks I saw a GOSH DARN-SHOOTING STAR, I can for certain tell you,  IT WAS NOT A FALLING STAR!!!!!!!!  Falling stars go down, and they’re white, blue, and do not defy gravity-this redish orange ball one did!!!   I ONLY SAW 1 fireball not 3 like most people. I STOOD ON A CHAIR AND I BELIEVE I SAW IT LAND.!!!! I have not gone out into the field to look if anything was their? I don't know why? I think I am still having a hard time believing wh! at I saw! I am scared to go look? I can't believe that I am writing to a ufo site? Never thought that would be me!!! I can tell you this much I have never seen anything like that in the sky, EVER IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308

No sound and no other lights were noted.  A minute or two later a third orb was seen.  After that a fourth was seen.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308

Brite orange fireball high above Brandenton, Florida.;2014-08-13 21:35:00;3 minutes;Bright orange fireball high above Brandenton, Florida. I took my dog out to the front lawn around 9:30 p.m.  At this moment, I could hear a commercial airliner flying above.  The airliner traveled from East to West at a high altitude. It was at this moment when a bright orange fireball in the sky caught my attention.  The fireball appeared as a oversized star and I assumed it could be a possible satellite in orbit.    The object traveled from West to East.  It moved slightly faster than a commercial airliner.  The object appeared as a orange fireball in the Western sky.    As it flew direct overhead, the light faded away.  Although there was no light or glow to the object, I could see the object continue in the sky to the far East.   Now the object appears to be larger with no lights.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308

They were just passing to the south of my home. There was no noise and they flew at a diagonal pattern from each other. So either one was somewhat lower than the other or one was a little further back from the other. They stayed at same constant slow speed never drifting in distance from each other.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
Small fireball  traveling over house in a wooded area.;2019-08-25 23:17:00;1 minutes;Small fireball  traveling over house in a wooded area. I was out on my pool lanai, looking up at sky, talking with my brother on my phone, when I noticed an object in the sky that was just still, it was like a vertical rod and just stayed above the pine tree line.  I kept my eye on it and just dismissed it as some refection, although I knew that was not possible.  I then noticed after about 6 minutes it just disappeared.  A few minutes later, what looked like a fireball traveled across the top of my lanai screen I could not believe my eyes I told my brother what I was seeing was unreal and could not be possible.   It looked like a miniature meteorite or shooting star, but they don’t travel horizontal across the top of a high pool cage screen.  It wobbled a bit and traveled on a steady course and disappeared out of my line of vision.  It did not have a trail behind it but looked like the back of a rocket, no noise at all. Very strange and unsettling.  I would say it looked like a “flame” around a ball.   We live on 10 acres.   It was very unsettling.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
