6 black objects, no sound, no lights, high rate of speed, flying in formation at 3:00 am;2002-06-01 03:00:00;2 min;6 black objects, no sound, no lights, high rate of speed, flying in formation at 3:00 am It was a while ago, approximately April or July 2002.  I believe it was a Saturday night.  I was at my job site at 3:00 in the morning taking pictures with my telescope.  When out of the southern sky, I observed 5 / 6 black objects flying directly overhead and then disappearing into the northern sky.  Two of the objects were flying erratically: moving side to side.  They had no lights and there was no sound.  They were flying in a formation of some sort.  Each object had what appeared be bent wings.  I wondered if it could be birds even though I could not see any wing movement, but Iâ€™ve never recalled a time when birds flock together at night and flew in formation.  They seem to be about 500 feet up.  The sighting time length was approximately 90 seconds as I watched them fly over my head.  Sorry, no pictures.  Did anyone else see it?
