2 fast-moving lights which spun around each other, then separated and rejoined;2010-06-01 23:00:00;5-10 seconds;2 fast-moving lights which spun around each other, then separated and rejoined A friend and I were sitting on the tailgate of my truck in her driveway at about 11:00 pm on or around June 1st, 2010. We were watching a police helicopter fly circles over the neighborhood.  As the helicopter was approaching us, we saw two fast-moving lights cross in front of the helicopter's path, moving from our right to our left. The lights were about as bright as an average star, and were positioned closely beside each other, like the wingtip lights of an aircraft. They were solid, unblinking, steadily-moving lights. There was no sound coming from them, at least none that could be heard over the approaching helicopter, although the lights appeared to be much closer to us than it was.  We continued to watch them move rapidly across the sky. I was thinking perhaps they were the wingtip lights of a glider or something, they didn't look like anything I'd seen before. When the lights were directly above us, they spun around each other once quickly, like the wingtips of an airplane doing a barrel roll.  Then they did something I'll never forget: The two lights appeared to unlock from each other, increasing the distance between them briefly, then they rejoined and appeared to lock together again. Immediately following this maneuver, they made a sharp upward turn and disappeared from sight. The total time elapsed between our first sighting until the upward turn was less than 10 seconds.  I have no idea what we saw that night, but I'm confident that it was no ordinary aircraft. It was hard to judge the altitude of the lights, but I'm pretty sure they were low enough that we should have heard some engine noise, even over the helicopter, as it was still far away from us. The only way I can explain the lights expanding and coming back together is if they were on the wingtips of a variable-wing aircraft like an F-14 Tomcat... However if this were so, I'm sure we would've heard the engines, and I just can't see any conventional plane being able to move as sharply and precisely as these lights did.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
Saw it Again to the West this time.Large Colorful Pulsating Light.;2011-12-24 05:00:00;30 min;Saw it Again to the West this time.Large Colorful Pulsating Light Posted a report about a Dec 23rd sighting of a pulsating color changing light in the sky east of I75 in Manatee county. Well I saw it again this morning, this time in the Western sky over the gulf of mexico. Same object but much, much farther away. This time I was able to view it through binoculars for appx 30 minutes. Actually got my wife out of bed and made her watch it with me. I am a little freaked out as to what the heck this was. This time with the aid of 16x32 power and also 7x50 power bino's I was able too observe many, much smaller points of light dance all around the larger object. The large object again pulsated and changed from red to blue to green to yellow. It Appeared to remain stationary for the 1st 20 minutes of observation as the smaller red and blue points of light danced all around the large object. Had too be at least 10 to 12 of them but they were so fast and erratic in their movement that it was hard to confirm an exact count. After ap! px 20 minutes the small points of light just merged into the Large object and it slowly began to drift up and to the south. From my location/angle it appeared to rise in the sky about a foot and drift to the south about 4 feet. Then it just dissappeared like someone turned off a light. No flash, No nothing, just there one second gone the next. So now my wife and I are both freaked out a little and as we take our dogs for their morning walk as I proceed to tell her about my Dec 23rd sighting that occured the previous morning. Same object without the little light's dancing and much, much closer/larger. When we got home from walking the dogs I went back outside to see if anything had returned to the area in the sky we saw the object. Saw nothing at first but then I thought I might be seeing some twinkling lights around the same general area in the sky. Looked through the Bino's and saw 2 Military jets flying all around the area flying larger and larger circles. The scale of th! e jets were that of the small dancing light making the scale o! f the la rger object HUGE!!! This went on for appx 25mins then they headed out over the Gulf of Mexico out of site. Just like yesterday someone else had too see this. Any body looking to the west towards the Gukl around the same time could not have possibly missed these lights. They were very distinct and Bright. 0331exmc ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
Large Pulsating Colorful Light over Eastern Manatee County;2011-12-24 06:30:00;5 min;Large Pulsating Colorful Light over Eastern Manatee County I was on my way to work traveling East on rt64 around 6:30 am Dec 23rd.  As I drove under Interstate 75 I noticed a very large Brite shimmering light to the east, slightly southeast.  As I approached my turn on Lena rd I realized this object was changing colors rapidly from red to blue to green to yellow and pulsating.  It was hovering like a helicopter but much too large.  I drive a jeep and had the top off so had a very good view of this object.  I turned onto Lena rd and pulled off the west side to observe the object.  It stopped pulsating and began to change from one solid color to the next. It was silent and appeared to expand in size as I watched it for appx 3 minutes.  A fog bank came off the dairy farm and put a stop to my view of this object.  I started my jeep back up and began to head south on Lena rd hoping to get past the fog to view object again,  When The sky lit up with a white flash. Object was gone when I waa in a spot where I would be able to see i! t again.  Anyone (100's of cars/people)traveling on I75 or East on rt64 had too see this.  It was HUGE!!! I told no one of this. 0331exmc ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
