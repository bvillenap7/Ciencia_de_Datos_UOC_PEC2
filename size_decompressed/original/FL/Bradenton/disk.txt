2 rapid moving almond shaped discs initially heading east from the Gulf of Mexico and sharply turning south.;2004-03-26 19:50:00;3 - 4 mins.;2 rapid moving almond shaped discs initially heading east from the Gulf of Mexico and sharply turning south. At approximately 19:50 PM this evening while trying to find the 5 planet alignment near the moon, my 13 year old son and I noticed 2 saucer like shapes rapidly heading towards us (we face Palma Sola Bay/West).  They were appearing to be racing one another but side by side, sometimes crossing each others paths.   They were quite large, no blinking lights, no sound at all, greyish in color.  When they were positioned just under the moon, they turned sharply and headed south. It looked like they briefly slowed down over the baseball park lights (which were on) and then rapidly headed southbound remaining next to one another but on occassion crossing paths.   When they were side by side, they were in identical formation and going at the same speeds.  Once or twice when they crossed it seemed they got out of synch but quickly went side by side again.   We watched them head south bound until we could not see them any longer from our balcony.  The sky was quite clear, some small, light clouds, temp. approx 73 with light breeze coming off of the bay.   The shape of the crafts were somewhat almond-shaped, with some type of haze surrounding them, moving very, very rapidly.  There were some distant planes in the sky but none of which were moving at any rate close to what these two crafts were going. ((CORRESPONDENCE WITH WITNESS)) Dear Mrs. ((name deleted)), Thank you very much for your telephone call, and for the excellent report!  We just received your son's report, as well. We will post your reports in the very near future.  If you find any other witnesses in your area, please let us know, and please encourage them to submit their reports to our site, as well. What was the apparent size of the two objects, relative to the size of the moon, or the planets, in the night sky, please?  How big did they appear to be? Thanks, again, for sharing the reports with our Center! Cordially, Peter Davenport ((RESPONSE)) Dear Mr. Davenport,   I will be working on witnesses tomorrow morning and will let you know if I find anything else out.     As for the size of the objects you'd have to know this info: ((name deleted--son)) and I were facing due-west, as looking out onto Palma Sola Bay from our balcony on the second floor.    I had a small map of the planet alignment that I was holding up and trying to relate Jupiter and Saturn to the left of the Moon.  ((Son)) first saw the objects and yelled for me to put the paper down.     They approached directly towards us but underneath the moon and were definitely closer to us than the planets and stars/Moon.  I would say that they were rather large, much larger than a plane that's for sure but in width especially.  I would venture a guess that they were maybe around an altitude of approx. 40 thousand feet or so, HOWEVER they seemed to pull back and forth quite a bit so maybe at some times were as low as 20 thousand feet and slightly higher than 40k ft.   They darted up and down and horizontally directly in front of us for less than a minute and then darted over towards the baseball park, where they didn't go directly over, but went more towards the north side of the park and seemed to almost stop for another half a minute or so.  Almost as if they hovered and then sharply flew north for a moment and then took a serious turn and headed south VERY quickly.   An interesting note was the fact that one of these objects seemed more stable than the other.  One was always crossing the other and seemed to want to stray but was pulled in next to the more stable object. I would also state that they were definitely following the coastline as they headed south.        As I had mentioned, I have been reading up and found something very uncanny regarding our sighting here, to someone in Scotland.  I've copied and pasted the reference....it's almost identical!  (Source http://www.rense.com/general6/discsspotted.htm) ((#2)) I do now believe that the objects may have been as low as 10 -15k feet at points last night.  I did observe some airplanes landing and based on recent flights that I have taken, I would have to say that they were probably at this level at a couple of points.   Hope this helps you.  ((name deleted)) ((#3)) Would it help if I drew you a picture of the objects and the paths they took? I can scan it over to you tomorrow if you would like.  ((#4)) You're very welcome.....   I've been reading on your site re: the many sightings here in Florida as well as in the local vacinity in which we live.  Up until last night, I had no idea what was going on down here! I'm amazed.   I use to tease my ex-husband about his sky watching and filming.  I will never, ever do that again!  I have tried to make a rational explanation for what we saw and just cannot do it. Nothing makes sense with this (I'm sure you've heard this before though).   I was really interested in the one report from a few years back of someone seeing crafts embodied in their own haze: THIS IS WHAT WE SAW LAST NIGHT!  No extra lights the objects seemed to glow greyish from within and emit a brownish haze that encompassed each.   Anyhow, I won't take up your time here.......I'll scan over the picture(s) tomorrow morning for you.   Have a good evening Mr. Davenport. ((#5)) Dear Mr. Davenport,   Attached is my drawing of what we had seen last night.  If you have any problems w/this, please let me know as so I may clarify.  Hopefully you will get a better understanding of our view from the balcony.   Thanks again, ((NUFORC Note:  Please see illustration from witness on the NUFORC homepage.
