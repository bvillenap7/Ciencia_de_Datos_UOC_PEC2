a yellow flying object hovering lowly without sounds.;2006-09-06 18:15:00;unknown object;a yellow flying object hovering lowly without sounds. After thunderstormy weather, the storm was clearing up. The evening sun appeared. Good visibility distance. Some of low pressure clouds present. Mostly, in west coast (coastal beach) having a lot of huge low pressure clouds with possible thunderstorms. On my way to attend the workshop meeting to a specific place. I parked my vehicle. I saw a motorist and lady passenager stopping their vehicle on middle of street road.  They looked up and tried to take a few pictures of their cellphones. Puzzled. I looked up. My gasp, the yellow sphere-like object about 20 yards away from I stand holding a large drink of iced unsweetened tea at my vehicle parking on a parking space. It was hovering about 10 mph from the west coast to east coast  from 14th street. I called several friends to witness it before it went disappeared. No one had a camera.  The motorist with lady passenager tried to follow it but could not do to go due into congested heavily traffic on northbound.  It went disappeared in northern-eastern area after 5 minutes.  I saw with my own eyes. No ordinary thing as a remotely drone or spy object or weather balloon.  It came from west coast (beach) to east coast (inland) I assumed within 20 - 30 miles distance radius. I drew an art picture of yellow object that might have an electromagnetic supposed to hover with approx 10 mph speed. It may have a hidden windowshield.  It moved slowly clockwise and counterclockwise without sounds like a navigating system to see me standing to look up at flying unknown object in the air about 20 yards away from the ground.  The object was similiar as almost size as ordinary car-suv vehicle . I know no one manufactures a flying strange object but a possible futuristic with advanced technological system? Anyone from Manatee who did witnessed taking same pictures of any cellphone's built-in camera on Sept. 6, 2006 Wednesday evening 18:15pm?  If no one reports this, keep this classified confidentiality, please. Thank you.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
palma sola bay southern sky...portal? or skyway too the universe...i cant stop thinking that after what i saw.;2007-07-07 21:30:00;1 minute;palma sola bay southern sky...portal? or skyway too the universe...i cant stop thinking that after what i saw. my friends took me out to the causeway to go shrimping, the tide was still to high, so we prepared the area and baited the water. we were all startled to hear fire works. good ones, off of someones dock.as they finished, my buddy said he had seen a flash (in the north west sky) he said he thought it was a meteor. so all three of us proceeded to look for more, remembering the massive shower several years back we all then saw another, bright fierce and swift( in the south east sky) about 30 seconds later in the same exact spot, we ALL spotted a small object(buddy said at first it was a satellite) it was moving south( comming from north east traveling south west but still in our south east view) if that made sense) i almost believed him, then i saw it swerve twice then stop then exit site near the brightest star in the southern sky. we ALL  saw it swerve twice , as if avoiding something in its path stop then left our vision .;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
Bright object appears on Northern exposure, Bradenton, Florida;2011-09-09 20:50:00;five minutes;Bright object appears on Northern exposure, Bradenton, Florida Bright object assended into view on Northern exposure of house.  Object appeared to be self-illuminating, able to hover and made erratic movements until quickly receeding to the Northeast, as an airplane appeared from that general direction (North/ North-east).  While hovering, object made no perceivable sound.  The object's movement's appeared erractic regarding flight course despite this, its rapid movement in different directions appeared intelligent/ proactive, rather than reactive or a natural phenomenon.  The other witness stated that the object appeared spherical in shape, I could not recognize a constant shape to the object, which in my perception only appeared to be in constant fluctuation, regarding both shape and movement.  Airplanes and helicoptors frequent this airspace and are easily recognisable, this was neither.  Vague cell phone video taken, hardly discernable light present for mere seconds.  If submitting this low grade video is helpf! ul we will provide to investigator upon request.  Please contact via e-mail.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
Bright star look alike but not high enough and has a behaviour of its own...more then one every night and into the morning, then gone.;2015-09-01 21:00:00;ongoing;bright star look alike but not high enough and has a behaviour of its own...more then one every night and into the morning, then gone. These pose as stars but way to big and bright and watch them closely and they move and their lights go crazy also way to low to be a star and it happens now every night..  It tries to pose as the north star, but you will know its not.  They are not affraid of being seen anymore.

7 orange spheres flying in formation.;2019-05-19 21:10:00;10 minutes;7 orange spheres flying in formation. Looking in the eastern sky,I saw a single orange/yellow sphere of light traveling north to south.  Initially I thought it was a rocket launch as I have seen some in the past,same color,same trajectory.  This remained visible longer than usual and it seemed to turn to the east.   About a minute later I saw two more in formation at a considerable distance apart taking the same path.  About 15 seconds later I saw two more in formation and a third seem to come out of nowhere,again at distance apart and about 15 seconds later a final single one came from the same origin, path and speed.   Please note, there was no sound whatsoever, but there was small aircraft (2) in the air at that time flying east and southeast that I know they couldn't help but seeing what I witnessed.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
