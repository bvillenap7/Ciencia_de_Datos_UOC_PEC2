almost stationary circular light w/ circling arm w/ illuminated tip;2001-06-16 20:35:00;15 minutes;almost stationary circular light w/ circling arm w/ illuminated tip My family and I were at the beach when I spotted a bright star straight up and slightly behind me. With my binoculars, i observed what looked like an off center bright ring of light. Thinking it was just a star that i couldnt focus on, I waited for a few minutes. Then I noticed it had slowly changed its position from southeast to northwest.Looking up once more as it was getting darker, I noticed a small straight arm with a tiny light at its end appearing to be circling the center light. Often this arm would stop at an eleven oclock position and become shorter by at least half of its original length. By this time , the kids were cold and wanted to go home. As we were walking to the van, Ikept glancing at this light. Right before I reached the van I looked up, and the light grew slightly. At that moment ,it vanished. Is it possible this could have been some sort of satellite?;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308

These were not fireworks nor planes of which  I have seen many  -   they were things I had never  seen before --;2011-07-04 22:00:00;5mins;these were not fireworks nor planes of which  I have seen many  -   they were things I had never  seen before -- On the 4th of July, after seeing a few fireworks in the sky at 10:00pm,  I looked to the eastern sky and saw a bright  orange oval shaped object that was glowing  was yellow inside - looked  like a catâ€™s  eye - it seem to float across the sky with  no sound and  no blinking lights -- just a glow -  it gradually climbed  higher and higher headed west til it was out of sight.   In about 1 minute, another one  came and flowed  the same  path and then a few minutes later , another one  came following  the exact  same path  as the two before.   Then I saw a plane behind them - it had blinking color lights and a noise and  I  am sure was headed  for nearby  airport - I  was not sure if it was following the  objects or not --  I know was not fireworks - they were over  and fireworks make a noise and fireworks dissipate into the sky  they do not float and follow the exact path - the lights usually go in many  different directions - these 3 objects I saw were all the  same color , same size and followed the  same path  - More may have come by,  but I grew a little  afraid  not knowing what they may do or if they knew I was taking pictures , so I went inside --   When searching the web, I learned many  people saw the same thing I saw some saying  3  orange to red color  - glowing ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

As I was driving. I looked over into a field and saw a light beam jump from horizon level into the sky. It stopped quickly before the clouds and pulsating off white beam lights making it look like its glowing.   When I realized what I saw, tree tops got in my view for less than 5 seconds.  Then when I got in the clear it was gone! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
