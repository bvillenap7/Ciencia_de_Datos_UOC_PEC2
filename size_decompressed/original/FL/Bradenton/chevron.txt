Chevron over Bradenton;2020-03-30 02:00:00;3 seconds;Chevron over Bradenton 3/30/2020  Early Monday morning at 2:30 AM, 3/30/2020, I woke up and I decided to step outside to let the cat out.  As I stood in the back yard, facing south towards Sarasota, I saw a flying craft that was shaped like a boomerang.  The front edge was visible, lit up sort of like headlights on the front of a car. It was completely silent, I could hear crickets and the neighbor's air conditioner. It was flying north and passed almost directly over my head, and moving fast towards Tampa.  At the speed it was moving it would have crossed the entire Tampa Bay in moments.  I lost sight of it because there are some big trees around the house which blocked the view.  My best guess: it was maybe about as big as a passenger jet, but flying low, maybe only as high up as what a Cessna airplane might normally fly.  And it was come and gone in 3 seconds.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
V shaped ufo flew over my house, completely silent.;2020-11-15 09:00:00;1 minute;V shaped ufo flew over my house, completely silent. I was standing outside my home facing north when I looked up at the night sky. I then noticed something floating toward me and I thought it was a funny looking drone. Once it came closer, I realized it wasn't a drone as it flew with no sound and flew steady fast. It was V shaped and had small white lights under it. I could see the ufo itself, but it was blended in with the night. I froze and stood and watched it fly over the house heading southeast. I was the only witness. Completely silent.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
