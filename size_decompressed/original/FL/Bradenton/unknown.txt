I was walking to my car after leaving the methadone clinic that I subscribe to at about 6:30am, I was reading a newspaper when something caught my right eye.  I dont know how to gauge how high it was flying but if you were to hold a penny up at arms length thats how big it was. Maybe 10 to 15 thousand feet high.  It was still dark outside from the waning night which helped me to see its orange light that it was emitting.  The lights on it were static and I could not tell how many lights it had because of how fast it was travelling.  I had taken an astronomy class last summer so I know that it was not a meteor.  It was so quiet but so fast.  There was no smoke or sound I caught it in my right eye almost all the way to the right of the sky and in about 4-5 seconds it had travelled all the way to the left and disapeared from my sight.  I had asked myself about 15 times if I was really seeing this and I know that what ever it was I was not seeing things.  I do! nt expect anyone to believe me, so many people have cried wolf who can you believe? Also I go to the methadone clinic and do not have other witnesses so I know I will not be taken seriously but I just want someone with some insight to tell me if everything that I described is true then I might have the answer that most other people are dieing to know.;27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308
