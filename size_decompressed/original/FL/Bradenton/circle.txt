A round orange lite.;2001-12-23 22:30:00;2 minuts;A round orange lite. The night befor my birthday I was out with my friend, I was looking at the stars and saw an orange lite in the corner of my eye, I looked over and saw it go strait across  above the trees. I turned to show my friend and looked back over, it was still moving,it was faster than an airplain but slower than a shooting star, About a minut later it disappeared, like the lights turned off and never saw it again. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness implies a date in 2001, but we are not certain.  We have amended the date here.  One of two reports by same witness.  We are surprised that the witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate, given that it allegedly occurred the day before his birthday.  PD));27.4593038497645;-82.5254990610308

Low flying orange fire like ball;2012-06-14 22:30:00;2 minutes;Low flying orange fire like ball Looked up and saw an orange/red ball flying rather low. Lower than airplanes I see around here, or at least appeared low.  It looked like fire. Not really blinking, but sizzling would maybe describe it best. It was moving fast like if were an airplane, but would've had to be a low flying airplane.  I was at one side of the barn Znd yelled to my Freind at the other end for her to look up.  She said&quotthat's weird, what is that&quot.  I ran to her end to watch it, but it appeared to be smaller and s little more faint. Like it wasobing up or fading out. It looked like a flame about to die.  There was not one sound coming from the sky, nothing. It just disappeared. I watched airplanes fly Around after that, a which looked Md sounded like airplanes, even with them being much further away and much higher, I could hear them.  This orange light was moving west, towards the gulf. It looked like a flame from a hot air balloon ( the best thing I can think to describe it).  My Freind said it was much to fast for that. Did anyone see this?  I've never reported nor seen anything like this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

He called me in from the house and we were looking up South west of our home and we saw these orange orbs going across sky from south to North in a straight line maybe half mile between each following, and then they would dissapear above us like going into the atmosphere and we couldn't see anymore and just then there would be 5 or 6 more then would do the same we thought oh this is finished and then from the south we would see another line of them. we have never seen anything like this before, what were they? we listened to hear if we there was a motor or any noise and we heard nothing.
