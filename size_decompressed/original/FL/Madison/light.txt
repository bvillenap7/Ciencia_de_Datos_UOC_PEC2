Strange light in the sky just before dawn.   ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch from Cape Canaveral.  PD));2015-11-13 06:00:00;5 minutes;Strange light in the sky just before dawn While getting my morning coffee I notice a weird light in the night sky.  It was mostly round with an aura, its near dawn, but the light is clearly not the sun (still hasn't risen yet)  I'm not sure what it was, no sound like a plane or helicopter, but very bright, conspicuous and haze around the light.  I went outside and continued to try to make sense of what I was seeing.  I watched the object until it dipped below the treeline.  It moved in a mostly straight line motion (no weird turns or anything) but moved much slower than a typical aircraft flying at altitutde.;30.4788;-83.4055
