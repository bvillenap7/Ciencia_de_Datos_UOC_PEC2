Orange fireball silenty gliding through the air over my neighborhood/house.;2012-11-22 21:00:00;5-7 minutes;Orange fireball silenty gliding through the air over my neighborhood/house My mother and I witnessed an orange fireball silently gliding over my neighborhood and directly over my house on Thanksgiving night after returning home from my grandmother's house.  I was able to partially capture part of the sighting on my camera phone. However, the quality isn't that great due to the fact it was night time, but I have it nonetheless. It was a cool night. No clouds whatsoever were in the sky no fog, haze or other atmospheric conditions. The time was approximately 2100 hrs., and total duration of the sighting lasted around five to seven minutes. It was traveling from the north-northeast to south-southwest direction.  The object itself was a bright orange fireball-like “sphere.”   I first noticed the object as we were pulling into the driveway of our house. There was only one object and it was completely silent.  Elevation of the object was hard to determine but it was VERY low.  If I had to hazard a guess I would estimate it to only be several hundred feet in the air. It glided at a consistent speed neither speeding up or slowing down on its course. There was a smooth, constant, almost coasting type of quality to its speed. I was anxious to report it to someone, but I had no idea who.  I was listening to Coast to Coast tonight (12/08/12) and one of the news segment guests mentioned ufocenter.com and how there have been a lot of these same sightings of “fireballs” last month.  I jumped on the computer and visited your site and composed this report now.  I'm just glad to finally have some place to report what I saw.  I also checked out some previous reports and noticed another sighting here in Winter Haven describing a fireball as well. Please feel free to contact me personally if you need more info or have any other questions, as I will more than happy to answer them.;28.0246320566199;-81.7376520399683
Fireball that dropped something with flashing lights.;2013-08-07 11:00:00;10 minutes;Fireball that dropped something with flashing lights. Thought a possible firework. Seemed to be shooting diaganolly into the air with a jet stream behind it.  The fireball coming from the object seemed to intensify then lighten.  It seemed to stop and hover then come closer towards us very fast then seemed to have dropped something with two glowing white lights that just kept falling and then disappeared.  The fireball object then slowly moved further away into the clouds until it was out of sight.  Then out of nowhere a very bright white cloud appeared that seemed to have a glow about it.  This was at night all the other clouds in the sky are dark and not very visible.;28.0246320566199;-81.7376520399683
