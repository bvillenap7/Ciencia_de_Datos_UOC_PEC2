strange skies over Winter Haven;2005-06-14 15:15:00;5+ minutes;strange skies over Winter Haven While in the drive-thru lane at a bank, my 13-year-old son spotted something unusual in the sky.  What we saw were 3 oval-shaped objects, of uniform size and description.  These ovals were somewhat bright.  They would appear in a bowed line, then disappear only to reappear in a triangular formation.  They would then disappear and reappear again in a line but slightly dancing in a snake-like manner.  This cycle continued for 5 or more minutes, with no set pattern as to how they would appear.  However, the patterns that the object or objects made appeared to be equal and precise.  In addition, while they were visible, the tube device that carries the transaction from the driver to the teller seemed to not be working as we had a difficult time getting the machine to work until they were gone.  This was witnessed by me, a 37-year-old mother of two, my two children, both boys ages 13 and 8, and my son's 14-year-old friend.  My 30-year-old sister-in-law was in the front seat next to me, but she was unable to see this object.  We are not sure why as it stayed within the same basic area (disappearing and reappearing within the same general area and the area wasn't very large.  The rest of us were able to view the show for 5+minutes.  This was at 3:15 in the afternoon and the skies were otherwise clear;28.0246320566199;-81.7376520399683

Also in the same area yesterday at 5:40am I also sighted one while I was out fishing that was so close and bright that if i looked anywere near that object it would blurr my vision, i was the only on that saw it , but i managed to snag a pic of it on my cell phone,though it showed up looking further away and not as bright but in real life it was so close that i stared to freak out a little which is very weird because i do not do that easily.;28.0246320566199;-81.7376520399683
