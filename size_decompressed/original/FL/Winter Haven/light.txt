Lights in the sky.;2004-05-11 23:00:00;1 hour to present;Lights in the sky. We saw UFOs to Southeast while standing on a dock on Lake Eloise in Winter Haven Fl. The distance could not be determined. They were lights appearing for minutes at a time, sometimes in couples, sometimes alone, then disappering. We saw as many as 6 lit at one time, and up to 14 total in diffent spots in the sky. They moved gradually, but never more than an inch from our perspective. The event is still ongoing, but we are no longer viewing them. The lights varied from low on the horizon to very high. They could not have been balloons, planes, gliders, fireworks, flares, meteors, or helicopters.;28.0246320566199;-81.7376520399683

These were not shooting stars they were entering the earths atmosphere buring bright red like the space shuttle when leaving the earths atmosphere. It lasted for at least two minutes entering the atmosphere.  After seeing the objects enter the atmosphere, four bright stationary lights appeared. There were four lights that turned on and off taking turns. They each lit up three or four times each and then stoped. This was no small airplane light or helecopter spot light. The lights were five times bigger and brighter than any typical aircraft light.;28.0246320566199;-81.7376520399683
Strange blinking light moving in random spots in Winter Haven Florida.;2008-05-01 20:00:00;15 sec;Strange blinking light moving in random spots in Winter Haven Florida. My sister and a friend of ours was in the back yard stargazing when they saw a light blink. It moved to another spot and blinked again a few seconds later, and kept doing that, jumping around in random spots within a small area and blinking every few seconds, then it stopped. I didnâ€™t get to see it by the time our friend came and told me, it had already disappeared.  The only thing I experienced was a very strange change in frequency as I was walking through my house, hearing a very high pitched squeal or whine that seemed to feel as if it were in my head as well. When I went back to the same spot where I felt and heard it, it was gone. This happened right before the sighting.;28.0246320566199;-81.7376520399683
Light blue ball of light in Winter Haven;2008-05-11 01:45:00;2 sec;Light blue ball of light in Winter Haven I was driving home when I noticed a light, I looked up and saw a bright blue ball of light flying through the sky.  It didn't have a tail or anything like meteorite would, it was just this blue orb, going really fast, then it faded off.  I'm surprised I even noticed it because it was traveling so fast, it was just the light that got my attention, I think it was coming up from behind me, and traveling South.  The only thing I could think of was meteorite, but I've never seen a light blue colored meteorite with no tail before.  What is strange is that I saw a blue ball of light earlier that week traveling really fast, low on the horizon, in a linear direction like a jet, but faster.  I thought it was strange, but didn't think anything of it until I saw the same thing again, only alot closer.  There was a van on the road with me that night, and right after the sighting, I saw them turning around, so I'm not sure if they saw it too or not.;28.0246320566199;-81.7376520399683
