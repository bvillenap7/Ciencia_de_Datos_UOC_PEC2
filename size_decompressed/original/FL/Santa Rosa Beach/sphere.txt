White  lights evenly spaced on wheel and spokes. I saw three spherical objects appearing as the size of a dime from my perspective.  I used my binoculars to confirm the spheres were not an optical illusion.  One north at about a 60 degree angle and two north northeast, one at about a 55 degree angle, a third below it at about a 40 degree angle.   They seemed stationery (hovering?)  I noticed 6 spokes.  They looked like wheels with sparkling white lights on the wheels and spokes evenly spaced.  The spokes seemed to protrude beyond the wheel.  I think I saw flashes of blue from time to time.   Two major air force bases in the community make the possibility they are drones a distinct possibility. I did not bother to look long as they were not moving. I am an 82 year old bird watcher and not prone to hysteria.  I hold a masters degree in the humanities (theatre and philosophy).
