I photographed both East & West observations while my clients changed their children's clothes.  The men from the session and myself all stared in confusion wondering what would cause a 'cloud' to form in such a straight line... it was very bizarre and NOT natural. I took a few photographs to document this strange observation to review after my photo shoot was over with. Once I was able to get the images back in the office and pull them up on the computer, it appears that it was not the 'pink cloud' that was questionable, but the blue shape that cuts into the dusty pink sky.  It looks like a 'wing' of some sort (from an aircraft - but much too large to be anything our military has or told us about), it even squares off with 90* corners before it stretches back across the sky.  This 'UFO' was so big I was not able to capture an image of it in a single photograph. (NOTE: No manipulation or enhancements have been done to these images.)   Image # 5598 shows myself facing northeast to capture the image.  Where the blue 'formation' squares off appears to be somewhere over Rose Mary Beach, FL (Approximately 20 minutes from where I was.)  The second image was shot facing northwest IMG_5599 - there is no way to tell where this formation ends, due to the cloud cover on the horizon line.  (However, it appears to go well into Destin, Fl.);30.3658999999999;-86.2457999999999
