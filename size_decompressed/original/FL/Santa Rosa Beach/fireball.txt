While closing down my rooftop bar, I looked up to notice a bright light in the sky off to the NW that I've never noticed before. Initially I thought it was a helicopter or low flying plane but it was one single light.  I work with aviation as a aircraft technician also so I knew this wasn't normal.   I got  concerned when I noticed it was not moving at all nor was there a trail of sound  for the distance it was away, if it were a plane etc. there would be sound of engine or propellers.   About 20 seconds later a second light appeared parallel to the first.  They remained in the sky for well over 5 minutes.   Another employee with me also witnessed it and neither of us could make sense of it.  I thoughtt maybe a tower had gotten put up recently that I has not seen but the first orb began to slowly rise upward until it was adjacent to the second.    They then burned out at  the exact same time  like someone let gas out of a lantern slowly.  I saw no sign of them afterwards.;30.3658999999999;-86.2457999999999
