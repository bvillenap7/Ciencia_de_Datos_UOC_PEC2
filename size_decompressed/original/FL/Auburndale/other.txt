I was driving West on SR/CR 92 and looking at the jets in the sky off in the distance with the contrails behind them contrasting with the bright golden/pink remaining skylight from the sunset. It was an extremely clear evening and cool out. As I watched the jets, a closer and brighter object caught the corner of my eye as it moved in place.  I'd say it was approximately 1000 feet up and tumbled in place. I say tumbled because the object appeared pare shaped only if you took a knife and cut the very top of the pair off giving it a flat top. The bottom half of the object was an extremely bright reddish orange glow. I only saw this glow as its (what I call) bottom end being the wider end of this object, came into view with its stationary position in the sky tumbling.  I pulled the car over and watched this object as it tumbled. When the wider more bright part of the object left my view, the object seemed to almost disappear except for a faint visual of the object in its position until its wider brighter part rotated into view.  This object wasn't traveling left or right or toward or away, as I said, it was stationary in the sky as it tumbled. The body of the object appeared very dark in color or black from my point of view. And if I held a dime up an arms length in toward the sky, it would just have barely covered the object from my point of view.  The object finally vanished with a single flashbulb effect and absolutely NO sound the entire time.;28.0699;-81.8107000000013
