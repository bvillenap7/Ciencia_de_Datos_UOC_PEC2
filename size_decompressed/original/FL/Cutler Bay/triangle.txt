As I was working gravdyard shift one night and got out of the company vehicle at a normal time and gazed up at the stars as I usualy do.  And when I look back I saw a black triangular object, it made no noise at all and it was camouflaged as a part of space but it was not consistant with the night sky behind it.  It moved slowly over a building, I quickly tried to follow it but it was lost over the building. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
