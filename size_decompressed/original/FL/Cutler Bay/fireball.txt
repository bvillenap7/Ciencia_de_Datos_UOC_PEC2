It was still dark when I looked up at 90 degrees and saw 3 fire balls with tails, at a very high altitude, traveling side by side in a southern direction. About 30 seconds later it looked as if the 2 outside objects converged with the center object. They kept heading south and at about a 45 degree angle to the horizon the ball split into 5 smaller objects.  They remained side by side for the most part.  These 5 objects then appeared to slow down to almost a complete stop before slowly disappearing from my line of sight.  They were an unknown considerable distance from my location during the entire event. I monitored the news through out the day but there was no mention of the event.  I also contacted a local news station they had not been aware of any reports or sightings.;25.5333;-80.3973
