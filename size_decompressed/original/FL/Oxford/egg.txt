My husband was sitting to the side a little behind a tree and only seen half of the incident. Myself on the other hand seen the whole episode front and center. We live in the country and the skies are wide open and you have a very good view of the complete sky. I seen this object move across the sky, it was only about 100 feet in the air, it was very low, it was extremely fast also, but my view was very good for the length of this object.  It moved across the sky from one side of the trees to the other where I lost sight. We figured if it did not land or crash then it probably only would have taken this object to reach daytona in just a few minutes.  Description: Oval or egg shaped lighted object, a solid object, not translucent. No light tail or anything following it or chasing it. No blinking lights like on airplanes. There was an ever so slight haze but not much. And moved at such a fast speed yet so close to the ground, still long enough in the sky to get a good look to see, there is no way this was a shooting star nor any airplane.;28.9089;-82.0633
