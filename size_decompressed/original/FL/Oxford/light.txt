These lights ascended from the South East of our location.  They did not appear to be commercial aircraft.  They could have been missiles or Jets that were scrambling.  There was no sound so it is possible that hess were very far away.  They would come up in pairs and there would be as many four in the sky at once.;28.9089;-82.0633
