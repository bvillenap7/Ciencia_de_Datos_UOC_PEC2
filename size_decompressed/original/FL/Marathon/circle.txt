Two cluster of lights stationary in sky 45 degrees off horizon;2009-01-20 05:00:00;5 minutes;Two cluster of lights stationary in sky 45 degrees off horizon January 20, 2009  Marathon, Florida   About 5:00 AM EST   I observed two close packed clusters of lights (no observable space between the lights) from my window looking northward on the gulf side of Marathon in the Florida Keys that remained stationary in the sky about 45 degrees off the horizon.   I watched them long enough to be sure they were not aircraft or satellites.  The one on the west from my vantage point was slightly higher than the one toward the east.  They were about 10 degrees apart.  The right hand cluster blinked very slowly approximately every two to three seconds it would disappear for two to three seconds.  At one point a very bright and fast ball of light shot down all the way to the horizon from the left hand cluster.   Having seen many shooting stars I knew that I was not observing one.   During the five minutes I observed this happened only once. The two groups of lights remained in the same position in the sky during my entire observation.

Bright object with 5M trail & underwater garage spotted  2.5M SW of Jolly Rogers campsite Marathon, Fla;2014-10-05 00:00:00;Unknown;Bright object with 5M trail & underwater garage spotted 2.5M SW of Jolly Rogers campsite Marathon, Fla. ((NUFORC Note:  We see nothing noteworthy in the photos.  PD)) On Sunday 10-5-2014, I was researching some of the area in the Florida Keys using Google Earth.  Last year when I did this I did not see what I saw this time. Approximately 2.6 miles southwest of the shore of the Jolly Roger’s RV camp, Marathon Florida, I spotted a bright dot in the Gulf of Florida (appears to be underwater).  The spot had a tail that appears to be about 1.5 miles long at first glance.  After closer inspection it appears that the bright dot came from a garage type object under the Gulf and traveled about 5 miles.  May have gone further, but Google Earth plotted area for just a short period. Further investigation of the bright object was difficult as Google Earth pixilates as I zoom in, however, I was able to estimate the size of the bright object.  It was the about 160 feet wide by 180 feet long with a path signature about 150 feet wide. The underwater garage appears to be a crescent shape about 160 feet wide at the opening –almost the exact width of the object. The coordinates of the object on my Google Earth are:  24.47.16.28N  80.58.55.35W  The coordinates of the Garage on my Google Earth are: 24.48.58.70N  80.54.39.00W      Image from Google Earth 20-5-2014;24.7259;-81.0375
