I was sitting out back behind my house, laying down and looking up at the sky while I was talking to a friend on my cell phone.  I saw 4 shapes that looked like mini carots with a faint orange glow flying across the sky from the north heading south.  As I watched them zoom across the sky, they weaved in and out of each other at very fast speeds while they were zipping across the sky.  It seemed much too fast and manuverable to be any ordinary aircraft.  They continued to weave across the sky for the few seconds I saw them until they disappeared to the south sky.  I have never seen anything close to this in my life.;24.7259;-81.0375
