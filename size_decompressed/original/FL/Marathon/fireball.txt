We watched this light travel very slowly for several minutes then become stationary for 2 to 3 minutes, then appear to move away from us and disappear.   Reappeared 10 minutes later southeast of us and moved slowly to the south, appearing to be much closer at first.   Remained stationary once again for about the same duration and proceeded to move away again and disappear. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  We do not understand why, given that the report was submitted one day after the alleged sighting.  PD));24.7259;-81.0375
