My friend and his wife saw it when i pointed it out. we were traveling about 45mph and the craft seemed to be going a little faster. it was out over the gulf a little bit. it was just after dark but its silouette could be clearly seen. we tried to get ahead of it and get to the gulf and get a better look at it but we were not fast enough. when we got to the  restaurant a few minutes later we were talking about it and my friend(retired air force) said that is something you will probably never see again in your life. when i made a shape in the air with my fingers my friends wife's  eyes lighted up in recognition. my friend said to say nothing because nobody would believe you.;24.7259;-81.0375
