I was on the 8th floor of the hotel and was looking out threw a glass window from a hotel room. I noticed a fast moving spheric metalic object that was streeking threw the ski. It was moving quickly at first, and then slowed down. It was pretty big and couldn't distinghuish it from any other aircraft I've seen before. It was not a balloon, it did not fly erraticly like balloons do. It flew in a vetical, controled speed, and at the same altitude. It never floated higher as balloons do. Weird!!! How the hell does one make a round metal ball fly?!?!?;28.2977674371179;-81.4296515295697
