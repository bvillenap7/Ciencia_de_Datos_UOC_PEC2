four bright amber lights in a row moving from east to southwest;1998-03-26 21:45:00;5 minutes (approx);four bright amber lights in a row moving from east to southwest four large bright amber colored lights in a row. One light lower than the other three. No noise. All moving from east to southwest slowly seemed to be fairly low altitude. Observed from the corner of route 192 and route 535 in Kissimmee, Florida. Arrived at another observation location accomanied by 11 other observers who corroborate the observation as we all saw the lights disappear over the horizon at that time.;28.2977674371179;-81.4296515295697
Bright Orange light, moved towards us and then to the right on the same horizontal axis, then faded and finally disapered.;2003-12-21 03:05:00;2 Minutes;Bright Orange light, moved towards us and then to the right on the same horizontal axis, then faded and finally disapered. At first we thought it was a helicopter, then an airplane.  It was a bright Orange light, hard to look at as it blured a great deal.  Left a small trail behind it.  Started off with a bright light, then moved to the right of the sky keeping on the same horizontal line, then slowly came to a stop, hovering over one point.  Then started to fade until a slight dim, which it stayed at for about thirty seconds, then vanished.  Throughout the entire period, the object never made a single sound.  I am just curious as to what exactly it is, because to be quite honest, it was the wierdest thing I have ever seen!;28.2977674371179;-81.4296515295697

Strange light in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));2004-10-17 21:20:00;about 2 seconds;Strange light in the sky I was looking up at the stars while at a stoplight in traffic, and I saw a small green light zoom across the sky, then it suddenly disappeared. The light was very far away, so I saw no details of the craft or anything, just a light. Sorry for the bad description.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));28.2977674371179;-81.4296515295697
Blue light in the shape of a cross captured by my camera.;2005-02-19 22:45:00;30 min.;Blue light in the shape of a cross captured by my camera. I was taking landscape pictures that night from the backyard next to a lake.  I was using a digital camera Canon 10D, with the best resolution. I  took a picture of the branches of a tree with the moon as the background.   In that moment I didn't see anything, but after I saw the picture in my screen I noticed the blue light with a similar shape of a cross.  After that I continued taking pictures of the same zone and I could take 10 pictures with this same light in different positions.  There were other 15 pictures taken in between the other 10  that didn't show this light.  I have the original compact flash with the original pictures.  I am attaching 3 pictures.   Please contact me if you require other information. I do not know what is this.  Could you reply to me what was captured in these images.;28.2977674371179;-81.4296515295697
High altitude, long lasting contrails and two bright white lights over Central Florida;2007-08-04 06:20:00;90 min;High altitude, long lasting contrails and two bright white lights over Central Florida On August 04, 2007, at 0620 I opened the garage door to pull my car out to leave for work.  It was a clear sky sun was coming up when I looked straight up and noticed a lot of contrails.  There were 360 degree turns, 180s, 90s just all over, but pretty much confined to being over central Florida, Orlando area. As I followed the trails I pretty much guessed it was probably fighter aircraft out of MacDill AFB, Tampa.  I thought maybe an early morning skirmish. I drove my car out of the garage and continued on to work. I stopped at a large intersection approximately 3mi. to the north of my house and happened to glance up at the contrails.  Two bright white stars were right in the middle of all the trails.  I thought those are awfully bright stars till I looked at the rest of the sky – NO STARS.  The sun was rising (0630) and washed out the rest of the stars but these two. They were absolutely still, no movement at all. Light changed and I continued on to work.  (I didn’t even notice the head-on collision that just took place before the light changed). I was stopped by another traffic light approximately 3 miles farther north.  I looked up again.  One of the lights had moved a little farther away, but remaining relatively motionless. The light changed and I kept watching as I drove. The light that had moved slightly off began to go straight up, faded and disappeared. The second light remained for approximately 5 minutes more and then did the same, began to go straight up, faded and disappeared. Within two minutes after the last one disappeared a jet airliner went directly underneath where the two lights were.  The jet was leaving a contrail, but was only 1 to 2 miles behind and it was disappearing. The contrails these objects left lasted for the best part of an hour and a half.  These objects were at a much higher altitude than the jet liner as well.  I also found out later that morning the Mars probe was launched from Cape Canaveral around 0530.  Some guy tried to tell me it was the trail from the rocket as it went up.  I have lived in Central Florida for over 50 years and watched way too many rocket launches to know it was not the rocket trail that drifted over.  The launch pad is a good 60 miles away.  I have never seen anything like this before, but it sure was interesting.;28.2977674371179;-81.4296515295697
Unidentified orange ball of light observed ascending from ground into sky, lost sight of object in clouds.;2009-11-23 01:50:00;15 seconds;Unidentified orange ball of light observed ascending from ground into sky, lost sight of object in clouds. I had just gotten off of work and was driving home when I observed a bright orange ball go from ground level and into the clouds.  The object was bright enough to light up the clouds around it, and at first glance I thought it was the moon.  The object did not appear to have a shape that I could see but the light was bright enough to have a kind of flare effect.   As I watched the ball of light ascend into the clouds I lost track of it.  There weren't many clouds in the sky that morning I could see stars clearly.  The object did not appear to alter its course in any way and I assumed it was a rocket launch from the nearby Kennedy Space Center.   When I arrived home I could find no reference of any launches and when I turned on the NASA channel they were not covering any launches.   I was facing east on Osceola Parkway and the object appeared east-north-east of my position.  I think it has to be a rocket launch of some sort from KSC, but cannot find any informat! ion regarding this.  Further, I have witnessed two launches from the NASA causeway and viewed several launches from the Orlando area.  All previous launches left vapor trails, this did not.;28.2977674371179;-81.4296515295697
Six orange globes grouped in three South of Kissimmee, FL.;2015-06-08 21:30:00;30 minutes;Six orange globes grouped in three South of Kissimmee, FL. I was sitting on my back porch around 9:30 and noticed 3 orange orbs glowing from the South.  I figured it was a plane since I live close to the Orlando airport but when I looked again about 10 min later there were 6 orange globes grouped in 3.  The 3 on the right formed a triangle, 2 in the back and 1 in front.  The 3 on the left were in a straight horizontal line. I then went inside to tell my parents to come outside to see it but when we came back out the 3 orbs in a straight line were gone.  We stared at the remaining orbs for about 5 minutes and then one by one they started blinking and then disappeared. We sat outside trying to explain what we just saw and then my dad pointed out that they were back. We went to the roof to get a better view.  This time they looked further away and there were only 2 of them, it lasted less than 5 minutes and they were gone again.  I managed to take a picture of the 6 that I saw but since it was dark and I took it from my phone it’s a little blurry.  When I went on the roof my mom handed me her camera and I was able to record it.;28.2977674371179;-81.4296515295697
Two of us saw bright green and red flashing lights above the treetops. The left light was blinking green. ((anonymous report));2019-04-17 20:15:00;2 minutes;On the above date and time, two of us saw bright green and red flashing lights above the treetops.  The left light was blinking green while the other two were green.  The lights turned all red and started blinking faster.  The lights then about a hundred feet and hovered.  These lights were roughly 500 feet away from us.   Before we could get our cell phones, the lights went out or disappeared.  We're on vacation from Maryland, but we will not be returning to Florida...EVER. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
