It blew me away because I saw these same lights in Kissimmee florida and I was not the only one.  My ex girlfriend and her whole family along with all the neighbors in the apartment complex all saw it. I even called the police.  These lights were hovering in the sky and more and more of them kept appearing and they didnt come from earth up they came from the sky and they were just like floating there and they didnt leave for a while they were just k in nd of hovering and moving around then in the blink of an eye they all started shooting very fast up into the sky disappearing 1 by 1.  The crazy thing was it was the exact same year 2012 that the Tennessee lights were sighted.  I was in the cobblestone apartment complex in Kissimmee fl when this event happened and can even take you to the exact spot.    do not remember the date of! the incident it was a long time ago but I do remember it happened at night.  There were many more then 6 witnesses but the 6 I listed is who I was with at the time.;28.2977674371179;-81.4296515295697
Seen 7 orange/red fireballs in central Florida on New Years;2015-01-01 00:00:00;7-8 minutes;Seen 7 orange/red fireballs in central Florida on New Years Looking up at the night sky in central Florida, my wife and I saw 7 orange fireballs in the sky at roughly 15000-20000 ft. altitude.  There was 1 at first and we thought an airplane had an engine on fire, until the other 6 in a group form came in behind what I'm gonna call the lead fireball.   They were headed south/southwest.  Could see the orange/red flame for quite a while until it faded from site.   I don't know what these things were, I'm wondering if I should be concerned?  Seems people are seeing these fireballs all over the US. does anyone know what these are for sure.  It's NOT a helicopter, airplane, or from the military.   We live about 20 min. from OIA and can hear those jet engines pretty clear, these fireballs were silent, no noise of any kind.;28.2977674371179;-81.4296515295697

Fireball falling from the sky of Kissimmee.;2017-11-18 18:00:00;15 minutes;Fireball falling from the sky of Kissimmee. Around 6pm, me and my cousin saw something weird “falling from the sky”.  We couldn’t realize what was, and then, he called my brother.  It looked like a big fireball falling.   We joked by saying that looked like a comet, but then, it started to turn completely.  And the smoke that was following the fireball just stopped and the impression of “a fireball falling” changed into a “light Flying “. I recorded and photographed.;28.2977674371179;-81.4296515295697
Bright orange light moving in sky.  ((anonymous report));2019-03-15 20:30:00;30 seconds;bright orange light moving in sky It was a bright orange fireball in the sky, which at first I believed to be a meteor. It moved diagonally across the sky, starting lower in the middle to the left.  Then, after a few seconds it was moving diagonally, slowly, like a plane.  Except it was EXTREMELY bright and orange, and I went inside for two seconds and then turned around, and it was in the middle of the sky, much higher.  Then, I watched it, and it stayed in the same spot, not moving left, right, diagonally, anything.  Then it just dimmed in less than half a second and was gone completely right in its spot.
