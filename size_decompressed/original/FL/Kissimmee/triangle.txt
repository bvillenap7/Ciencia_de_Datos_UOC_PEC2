Silver, Triangular Craft with White Lights Seen over Kissimmee, Florida October 16, 2009;2009-10-16 00:00:00;30 min;Silver, Triangular Craft with White Lights Seen over Kissimmee, Florida, October 16, 2009 October 16, 2009, Kissimmee, Florida, I saw a silver, triangular shaped craft flying very low over the top of the Radisson Resort Hotel in Kissimmee, Florida, some time after 11pm.  I saw no wings or flashing lights as a regular plane would have.  It may have been about the size of a helicopter judging from the distance it was from me.  It was not a large craft. It had white lights at each corner.  It appeared to be perfectly flat on each side like a triangular box.  I saw it at an angle.  I also saw a darker silver line down one side like you would see if that part extended out farther than the rest of that side.  It made no sound that I could hear.  I was at the pool. I only saw it for a moment and then it went out of sight once it passed the top of the building.  It was not moving quickly but I just happened to look up just as it was passing over the building. Later, I saw far up in the sky, two strings of white lights.  One moved very slowly off in one direction and the other moved very slowly in the opposite direction for a while and then stopped and stayed there for a long time.  I eventually went back to swimming and did not watch anymore ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));28.2977674371179;-81.4296515295697

We saw a Orange triangle shaped flying towards us then flew  off.  ((NUFORC Note:  Cape Canaveral missile launch.  PD));2013-01-30 20:50:00;3-5 minutes;We saw a Orange triangle shaped flying towards us then flew  off. At approximately 8:45 to 8:50. 7 friends and I were outside in the backyard when one of us noticed a bright orange starlike object flying almost towards us. It was very bright and we knew it was not a plane because it didn't have green and red flashing lights which most planes have and we knew it was not a star because it wasn't the same color as any star we have seen before.  The shape of the object was almost like a triangle standing up flying high and bright in the sky.  It also stopped in midair and turned around the opposite direction of where we were standing.  Then, the orange light shut off for about 2 seconds and turned on and moved away from us very fast.  We knew it was traveling very fast because it almost dispersed into thin air like a star that's very far away.  No matter what,we knew it wasn't a star or a plane but a UFO.  Another thing we noticed was that it made no noise whatsoever .;28.2977674371179;-81.4296515295697
