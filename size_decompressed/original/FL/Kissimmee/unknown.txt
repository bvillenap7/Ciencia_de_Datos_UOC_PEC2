The missile apparently was launched to the northeast, so it was visible along the eastern shoreline of the U. S..  PD));28.2977674371179;-81.4296515295697
Bright Orange light seen in Orlando sky.;2012-07-04 23:30:00;3 minutes;Bright Orange light seen in Orlando sky. Approx 11:30 pm I saw a bright flickering orange light ascending into the sky, I am aware it is Independence day but this was no firework.  It seemed large and bright orange and shrank as it ascended, distance unknown.   I watched until I could not see any longer.  My first guess was a rocket launch, but it was not in the direction of the Kennedy space center, it was from more central inland.   I still think it was a rocket launch to space, but could not locate any information on the internet.;28.2977674371179;-81.4296515295697

Fire looking object moving at a rapid pace, then just vanished.;2015-04-03 21:08:00;2 minutes;Fire looking object moving at a rapid pace, then just vanished. 1 Fire looking object, no sound. It was moving at a rapid pace in one direction. Was not a balloon.  After moving toward the Orlando International Airport, it suddenly vanished.  We have lived 5 miles south of the airport for 28 years.  We have been married 32 years.  We are in our 50's.  A normal couple with adult kids and a nephew who is Secret Service to the Vice President.  We are not nuts.   This past week we have seen one of these objects 2 times.  We have seen the fire balloons in the past as well, so we do know the difference, this was not one of them.  There was no drifting, it was in a strait line at a rapid pace, and suddenly was gone, not at the horizon, but gone midair.  There was no wind, and no clouds or weather issues.;28.2977674371179;-81.4296515295697
