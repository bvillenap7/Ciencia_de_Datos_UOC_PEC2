My wife, my 2 sons & myself were on vacation staying at a hotel on highway 192 in Kissimmee Florida. We had just gotten back from Disney in the hotel parking lot. My wife & kids were out of the car, I was gathering up our stuff. My wife suddenly yelled look up what's that in the sky? I walked over to where she was standing and saw 3 lights in a triangle formation moving rapidly overhead. Suddenly they began making rapid, intricate manuvers. They converged, separated, then one quickly orbited another. It all happened too quickly to remember precisely, about 30 seconds in all. While they were making these seemingly impossible manuvers they also continued their forward motion until we couldn't see them anymore. They made no sound. The 4 of us were stunned and we had an eerie feeling I can't explain. My wife said when she first saw them they were lower (or larger). She thought they were planes that were going to crash. The way she describes them they seem about the size of a 1 inch finger space held at arms length. By the time my sons and I looked they were about a quarter that size. So they appeared to be moving away as well. We seem to differ a little on the color. I & one son thought they were silver grey. My wife & my other son thought they were slighty yellow then became silvery. The sky overhead was pretty clear. There was some haze lower down that began to obscure them at the end.
