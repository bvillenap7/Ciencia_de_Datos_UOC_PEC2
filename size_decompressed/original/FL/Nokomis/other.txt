It was 12:00 a.m. when my grandma sighted the object in the sky.  She was sitting outside smoking a cigarette when she looked up into the sky and noticed an unusual object.  Shortly afterwards she told me to come outside with her for a second opinion.  I went outside and also looked at the object.  Sure enough it was nothing I had seen since I have lived here.  I have however seen objects in the past.  I ran inside to grab the camera.  Once back outside I began recording the object.  I have about one hour of recorded tape of the object doing different things such as changing shape.  I have atleast four different shots of the object, one from my pool cage, another from outside, and two from inside the house.  The object did in fact move because it was first spotted in the East, then three hours later it is in the West. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the reports describes Mars.  PD));27.1389;-82.4548

I got up and noticed a bright light in the sky, I thought it was a plane on fire I called my brother and his girlfriend out to see it but it was moving to slow to be a plane.  The object changed directions and went up into the sky.   We took a picture of the light.;27.1389;-82.4548
