I noticed what looked like a fast moving satellite until I saw pairs coming behind it. They were spaced apart and kept coming. I have no other explanation of what I saw. Definitely no blinking of lights just a constant pattern of 1 out front followed by the pairs that followed.  They came from sout west to a north east direction. Absolutely incredible. I watched them as the last one left my vision;27.1389;-82.4548
