My daughter and I saw an object that appeared to be smooth sailing in the air about ten stories above, and to the west of our auto.  It was shaped like a square (8ft) that was dull grey in color.   It was 3:30 in the afternoon on Sat. the 14th of March.It was traveling about 45 miles an hour, headed north, just like us.  It either got larger, or closer as we began to see red, uneven coloring on the front of it, as if we were viewing a large TV screen.   We thought it was some sort of lettering, but not legible as it was blurry, not the object, but the face of it. We could see no depth to the object.   We followed it for about 1 mile and turned toward it, heading toward the bay so we could see it over the open water, but it disappeared by the time we got to the bay, about four blocks west.   We were in Nokomis Fl, on highway 41, the South Tamiami Trail, by Oscar Shearer State Park when our sighting took place. We reported it to the Sarasota 911 line. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with these witnesses, and they seemed to us to be quite serious-minded.  We have no explanation for the incident and sighting.  PD));27.1389;-82.4548
