Bright sphere over Green Cove Springs.;2014-11-29 20:30:00;2 minutes;bright sphere over Green Cove Springs At approximately 8:30 pm, I was tending  the remnants of a small fire in my firepit.  The sky was clear and many stars were visible.   As I looked the the south, over the roof of a nearby house, I saw a brightly lit sphere.  It was motionless.  Since there are many ai4craft in the area, I at first thought it was the landing lights of an aircraft.  There was no sound at all and the sphere remained motionless for approx 1 min.  It then shot straight downward at an incredible rate of speed.  I lost sight of it.  It was definitely not a helicopter,  piston or jet aircraft, nor was it a meteor.;30.0012454545454;-81.7633393939394
