Lights in the sky one thousand times stronger than any airplane or helicopter search light.;2014-08-24 22:00:00;1 minute;Lights in the sky one thousand times stronger than any airplane or helicopter search light. I went out of the house to smoke a cigaret and look up to the sky and saw what I believe to be a meteor  coming down because  it look like a ball of fire but I saw no smoke trail.  I got scare thinking I was going to hit my house.when it got closer, may be one half mile or less from where I was it stop and stay still.  I hear no sound at all.   Now I realize  it was lights under some object maybe thirty feet in diameter.  It stay still for about thirty seconds them it shot out two small red lights that fade out almost immediately.  The light on the big object dim and then descended alway from my direction going southwest of Tamarac.   I lost sight cause it went lower than the houses in front of me.  I stay outside for a while looking in the direction it had gone.  All I could see far away was some lights as if lighting of a storm far away.;26.2128;-80.248
Extremely bright orange ball of light quickly ascending into sky, leaving a slight trail as it rose.;2016-05-06 01:30:00;2 minutes;Extremely bright orange ball of light quickly ascending into sky, leaving a slight trail as it rose.  Continued ascending for about 120 seconds, growing dimmer as it rose to about 40,000 ft (best guess based on other aircraft in vicinity.)  Did not disappear completely until travelling behind extremely thick cloud cover.  Made a very quiet humming sound;26.2128;-80.248
