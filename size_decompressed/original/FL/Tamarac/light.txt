My son and I were in my yard when we saw a light traveling at a very high rate of speed, stream across the sky.;2010-04-02 20:25:00;60 seconds;My son and I were in our yard laying on our backs, and looking at the stars.  All of a sudden my son said, What is that!?   What we saw was not like anything I have ever seen.  Perhaps it was a satellite, but I have never seen anything move this fast across the sky, other than a meteorite, and this lasted way too long to be a meteorite.  It looked like one bright light. The brightness about the same as a bright star and it appeared to be extremely high.  It was moving from WSW to ENE in an absolutely straight line and it took less than sixty seconds to cover the whole sky.  We watched it until it was lost in the horizon.
