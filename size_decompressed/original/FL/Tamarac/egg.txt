It was a clear night, 2AM and on my way to my parents home.;1988-06-01 02:00:00;5 seconds;It was a clear night, 2AM and on my way to my parents home. I was traveling West on Commercial Blvd.  Turned North, onto, one block East of the Sawgrass Parkway. (Can't think of the name of that Rd.) As far as I could see, I spotted a tiny dot of bright light as far as my eyes could see to the North.  Before I cold take a breath, the UFO skimmed along the top of the tree lined Road.  It made NO sound what so ever. My heart jumped, and I jammed my breaks on.  It seemed to travel in a perfectly straight line over the tree tops.  I could ot determine how high the object was.  When I turned around after stopping, It was absolutely gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1988 is approximate.  PD));26.2128;-80.248
