Spherical or slightly ovoid, stationary object observed, 5 minute time-frame 1/25/2012;2012-01-25 06:45:00;5 minutes;Spherical or slightly ovoid, stationary object observed, 5 minute time-frame 1/25/2012 I was walking one of my dogs, at approximately 6:45am, I walk them at about this time each morning. I am an avid “sky-watcher”, and enjoy watching the sunrise/cloud formations.  This particular morning, I’d stopped to wait for the dog to finish sniffing about, and stared up and toward the S-SE sky. Very light, cirrus clouds, mostly clear sky, sun just rising, illuminating clouds.  I noticed an object, appeared to be round, or very slightly ovoid, high in sky.  I waited for it to move, thinking it was either a plane, or a satellite. It did not move, at all, in any direction. This area is about 10-12 miles from Ft. Laud. Int’l Airport, and I see jets, helicopters, cargo planes, etc., all the time….we’re also close to the Executive Airport, private planes.  The sunlight reflected off of it, and it appeared to be metallic, silvery, shiny. I stared at it for a good five minutes, and then had to leave for my home, across street.   About a minute later, arriving at the! house, I peeked up again, and it was no longer visible. Oddly, I forgot about the entire incident, and went on MUFON the following day, as a friend up in VA had had a sighting, and I wanted to see if there’d been another reports made, in her area.  I was surprised to see that another local resident, in Coral Springs, about 5 miles north of me, had reported basically what I’d seen.  I reported to MUFON, that morning, the 26th, as well.;26.2128;-80.248
