Lights than formed triangle shape oblect flying overhead;2004-11-04 20:30:00;15 sec;Lights than formed triangle shape oblect flying overhead At about 8:30 Pm My sister and I were outside in our drive way when she asked me if I saw something in the sky, she was wondering if she was seeing things. I looked up and I saw an object flying northbound. It was a set of circles that formed an open end triangle much like a  >  sign. This object was flying not as high as commercial jet but not as low as private small aircraft. The reason I know this is because shortly after the sighting I saw a commercial jet flying northwest of our location and about one minute later we saw a small private plane traveling east of us. This object was really moving much faster than both of these aircraft. The circular lights that made this formation were not like regular lights, there were no center of brightness the whole circle was evenly lit. There was no sound coming from the object it seemed to just be gliding across the sky. I wondered if it was maybe a balloon but then little before it disappeared the formation of these lit circles changed, they seemed to form an almost circular shape. At the high speed of travel the object changed direction several times, very fluently and smooth- unlike an airplane the angles of change were not like an aircraft at that speed. I told some friendâ€™s but- I don't tell people anymore. They just don't believe.;25.987825;-80.25879375
