I just saw a neon green flashing diamond in the sky I live in Miami so they often have light shows but this one was singular and disappeared after a couple of seconds anyone who looks up at the night sky had to see, but it is what it is, it was moving fast and I was waiting for it to come down but it disappeared I'm not going to tell anyone because I didn't see where it came from but I will repeat this anyone at that time that was looking in the night sky saw it.
