U F O  caught on home surveillance camera...UNBELEIVABLE!;2009-01-12 06:23:00;5 minutes;U F O  caught on home surveillance camera...UNBELEIVABLE! I was looking at TV and the computer then I saw a volleyball size light start to dance around on the screen...up down changing to beach ball size and baseball size but not like blowing up a balloon more like morphing into a larger size and then decrease in size like the air was let out.. it was on camera in and out of the shot for 5 minutes. I have the footage it never changed colors.but it did do some maneuvering I did not see it when it first started but it caught my attention. After looking at the replay,it just materialized from nothing, although it appeared as a light ...a flashlight will not make my motion cameras record.and every time this craft came into the picture the indicator came up to alert me something was on the screen;25.987825;-80.25879375
10 red orbs moving ne then changing to nw while gaining altitude.;2013-10-19 11:00:00;10 minutes;10 red orbs moving ne then changing to nw while gaining altitude At 11 pm i was in the back yard of a cousins house at a party the backyard is facing west in the everglades/us27 high way area (this house is the last house on the miramar city limit) then i notice 2 orange red orbs coming from behind the tree line orbs must have been 1 mile or so away they grew in brightness and the red color of the light became more pronounced as they were moving in a north easterly direction gaining a slight bit of altitude then heading north west with a steeper altitude climb until they faded away in the distance 4 more groups of light followed the same flight direction as the last group had started it north west climb a jet coming from the southeast heading north west maintained its flight path as it was heading towards the last group of orbs which were still very bright and eventually climbed at a slight hurried pace. it was fun to watch and wonder i can tell you that much.
