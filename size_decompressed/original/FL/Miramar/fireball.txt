Orange probe like lights.;2019-06-25 03:30:00;3 minutes;Orange probe like lights My friends and I were getting in the car to go grab some midnight drinks.  I happened to look in the sky and seen four orange lights.  I was so in awe of what I saw, that all I could say was whaaat on earth do you guys see that?!? We couldn't quite understand what on earth it could be.  They appeared to be orange circle probes. 3 were aligned together not moving.  The fourth one broke away from the three and looked almost like a fire ball with an orange auro around it then disappeared.  The three stayed for another two minutes then disappeared!!  As we drove and spoke about it, two more appeared but were falling down almost like meteorites.  Had we not seen the previous ones that were stationary, we would've just thought they were meteorites or debri burning through the atmosphere!;25.987825;-80.25879375
