This craft did nothing unusual, no sharp turns, no fantastic speed, flying east to west.  There was only one craft.  The craft was triangle shape with bright lights.  This picture was taken on a clear day in July of '02 after it caught our attention during a family gathering.  Could you please let me know what it is. Thank You;42.6628;-84.0726
