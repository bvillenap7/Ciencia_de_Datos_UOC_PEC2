After approx. 3 seconds it was out of sight. It was a vividly bright green object with a goldish color tail moving at a very fast speed. The object traveled 4 to 5 degrees in a downward direction at a 45 degree angle until it went out of sight approx. at 4 to 5 degrees above the horizon. I am very familiar with aircraft off all types and I am an amateur astronomer with 20 years of experience of celectial events. This was not a shooting star or meteorite. I am a professional driver and I have worked nights for the last 4 years. I have seen one other fire ball of this type approx. 4 or 5 months ago over western Michigan.;42.6628;-84.0726
