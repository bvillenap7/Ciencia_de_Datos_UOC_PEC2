PD));2008-09-17 22:30:00;approx. 25 minutes;Object giving off bright red, white, gold and green lights. Stayed in place for 30 mins and disapeared. While I could not deduce an exact shape of the object, it proceeded to stay in place and there were flashing red, white and green lights. I first thought it was a plane, however, the lights were far brighter and concentrated than that of a plane. Also, the object(s) stayed in the same place for over 25 minutes. I noticed it outside my bedroom window around 10:30 pm and went out on my deck to look at it further. The object(s) appeared to hang much lower than the stars. It disapeared around 11:00pm.
