The object was a single bright round white light.  The object had no bliking lights like an aircraft would.  The object/light was too big to be a light from from an aircraft.  There was no noise, the object was close enough to be heard if it was an aircraft. The object was not moving very fast.  The object had speed, but not like a shooting star, satelite or a meteor. The object made some short zig zag movements that were too fast to be made by a normal aircraft.;43.1152298107257;-85.5138285488949
