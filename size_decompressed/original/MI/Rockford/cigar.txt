It was about 60’ long as compared to the small plane that crossed under it. I went to reach and bend down to lift up Captain’s seat and get camera, (5 sec.), on my pontoon boat, then I looked up to find it in the camera’s sights, and it had disappeared. Sky was clear, except for a few very high thin with several light lines of these high clouds, moving from the Southwest to Northeast. I kept looking for it for about 15 minutes no where’s to be seen. It had it’s mirrored, shiny, aluminum bright body, opposite the Sun, which was also about 80 degrees, up in sky. The plane came from a local personal airport on 11 Mile about one mile away, they landed after what it seemed as if they were going underneath the object, the plane was about 400-500' up. I have other 2 UFO sighting's here in Summer 2008, one silver & round in clear daylight, along with 3 other witnesses on board another pontoon, and 2nd sighting in Summer 2008, was a large round red light approx. at 11:30 pm at night, with just a few light see-through clouds. The red light was larger then plane lights, and it stayed steady until just fadding away or disappearing. The red UFO was approx. 300-500' up in air, about 15 degree up, and about 1/4 - 1/2 mile to N. Northeast of N.E. edge of Little Myers Lake, their were 2 children and 2 teenagers on pontoon boat fishing with me at night. No images of these 3 sightings were taken. I now carry a camera on my pontoon or other pontoons from now on. I will use your hotline number the next time, as I wasn't aware of your web site this time around.;43.1152298107257;-85.5138285488949
