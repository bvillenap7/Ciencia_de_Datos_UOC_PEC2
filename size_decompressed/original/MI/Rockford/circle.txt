To the East a round shape suddenly appeared with a constant strobing effect.  This strobing had definite red and possibly yellow with blue but not as eminite as the red.  It headed Westward in the sky hovering for seconds before it would backup and angle downward and again Westward.  It continued this pattern several times before it hovered for a time and suddenly disappeared.;43.1152298107257;-85.5138285488949

It was 2 years ago. But i remember it like it was yesterday.  I was outside in the field behind my house when I saw lights in the sky.  I looked up, and I saw 2 objects with lights on them.  The lights were blinking around the middle of the craft.  At first, I thought that what I was seeing was just airplanes.  But then as they got closer into view, I monticed that the objects I was seeing was definetly NOT planes.  They were circular in shape and they produced no noise at all.  I stared at the objects for the whole time they were in flight.  Until I saw them land in the woods that are about 1 or 2 hundred yards behind my house.  The way they landed was something I've not really seen.  They were flying forwards, until they got over the woods.  Then they stopped in mid air, and floated directly downward.  When they were flying, they were right next to each other the whole time.  The objects were i think silverish in color.  That sighting was pretty cool. Because I have never seen anything like it!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));43.1152298107257;-85.5138285488949
