Hello, my name is ((name deleted)) and I have seen at least 2 UFO sightings.   I lived around Rockford, Michigan about 7 1/2 years and have just recently moved to Maryland with my dad.   Well my first sighting was way back then around halloween in the year 1997 or 1998.  That night there were a lot of stars out in the sky with no clouds or anything.  I've been looking up the sky a lot and all of the sudden I see this big bright white light shining and then and make in incredible loud noise and zoomed westward from where I was.  It had all bunch of colors when the white light zoomed off in the sky, just like a rainbow.   I was shocked and could not believe how I saw something that cool in my life.   After that night I asked my mom and step-dad if they saw the white light zooming in the sky.  They said they only heard a loud screeching and so did my friends.  My friends said that they think it was a bunch of kids lighting up fireworks, but how could fireworks just zoom in the middle of the sky with a bunch of colors?   That was one of the best nights I've ever had. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  One of two sightings submitted by witness.
