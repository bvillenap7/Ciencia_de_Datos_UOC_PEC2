Fireball falling from the sky;2005-10-05 22:00:00;10-15 seconds;Fireball falling from the sky I saw a shooting star moving from the east, and it was heading west towards Lake Michigan.  It however, I was shocked to see it so suddenly that it was a fireball dropping right next to me, aprox. 10 ft. away from me.  It was about the size of a baseball (reddish-orange) fireball when I saw it perhaps 10 feet taller than my garage roof (ranch) and the fireball was dropping behind the garage (where I was on a deck) and it was dropping about 4 ft. from the back wall.   As the fireball was dropping past me, the fireball made a phisst and it blew up about the size of a childs soccer ball about 5 ft. from the ground, and when it pssst about 8-10 inches above the ground it just disappeared.  I didn't see or hear it hit the ground, however, I did see some small wisps of black smoke, very small, and disappeared.  However, about a min. later, the smell was pretty bad, very acidric smelling.   A couple hours later I went outside on my deck to sit where I had seen that shooting star, and although I didn't smell it anymore, but, it was so quick, I got very hit hard with nausea, and I had to go in to throw up.  At the time though, it's odd that I didn't even think that my nausea could have been caused by that smell, but, possible.  I thought I should mention this especially since for some reason I just wasn't connecting those events together, perhaps nothing, but then perhaps they were connected.  I was hit so hard with the nausea just the moment I sat down, and I was fine afterwards.   I still remember that smell, it was nothing I really recognized, however, maybe a slight plastic smell, but, not enough to call it burned plastic.
