very many extraordinary lights over bostwick lake for the past week every night  ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));2009-11-04 16:30:00;days and still going on;very many extraordinary lights over bostwick lake for the past week every night, definantly not from this earth ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD)) The first sighting happen in grand rapids and appeared as 5 bright orange dots, they were moving as one object but it was to dark to see any structure, they were very close to the ground floating right above a really tall building about 100 feet, the size of the object was huge the lights  spread about 150-200 ft apart. we went back to see these lights about 15 minutes later and they were gone.on nov. 7 i sat on my porch and looked into the night sky over my lake(bostwick lake) wondering what was out there cause i seen those strange lights about a week before, when all of a sudden i notice this bright flashing light in the sky, it was very big, at first i just thought it was a plane then i noticed the lights were in a straight line, there was light all different colors( green orange and red) they would flash one after another in a straight line but very fast, soon i notice another one moving into my view over the lake, it passed the other light very  fast and was very very close to the other one. the lights where very strange when they would move they would kind of flicker to another position around where it was but the strangest part was that it would flicker and end up behind it its original path,i noticed more and more light as i watched the sky, dont have an exact number but there were at least 15 separate moving objects in the sky over the lake, there was another light that flashed very rapidly it almost looked electric but there was only one and it was very different than the other lights,i also seen planes flying right next to and around all of these lights. after watching this for about an hour i see 3 lights emerging from the darkness in the sky they were very bright and orange, there was three of them and they made the shape of a triangle, the triangle was massive again you could almost see a structure but it just look a different shade of black between the lights, as i watched it i noticed the light moving away from! each other,but i as i watched i noticed the object was only c! oming cl oser it stayed in one position  not moving for about an hour, i went inside for about 15 minutes and went back out and it was gone, as i was watching some of these light i seen shooting stars or what looked like them pass right by the lights and that happen about 3 times in 5 minutes, another light i was watching was moving at a very fast speed and i seen what looked like a red shooting star shoot straight downward but it was very close, u could see the flames on it.i seen many objects and i have to say it almost traumatized me, iv never seen anything like it and there were so many. i have seen these lights every night since, they do not come around during the day only night around 6 or 7 until morning, just last night i watched a light which was the exact same 3 lights in a line  flashing object and it was very low to the ground, maybe only 100 foot or less it was a little in the distance but enough to see a structure,it was almost circular shape but with a tail that hung d! own behind it. the object moved back and forth from left to right and about a 100 foot area all night. any person watching bostwick lake skies will see these objects they light up the sky with the amount of them, it is  very strange and they are not planes i can promise you i have a video of  one of the lights also.;43.1152298107257;-85.5138285488949
Bright light that moved in a very unusual &quotflight&quot pattern;2021-01-14 05:45:00;Hour/s;Bright light that moved in a very unusual &quotflight&quot pattern Saw what at first appeared to be a shooting star. Then the light which appeared to be the brightest, began unusual movements such as loops, concentric circles.  It remained in a confined area.  No sound. Unable to record any image.  The light was bright enough to still be seen at 6:50;43.1152298107257;-85.5138285488949
Large bright white light traveling towards ground over West Michigan 7 June 2021 22:30;2021-06-07 22:30:00;3 seconds;Large bright white light traveling towards ground over West Michigan 7 June 2021 22:30 On a night walk, my wife and I spotted a large bright circular white light traveling straight down and considering the distance and size, it may have been anywhere from Rockford MI  to Lake Michigan.  My thought was space debris, but not sure.  The object was about the diameter of my pinky finger (about 3/4 inch).;43.1152298107257;-85.5138285488949
