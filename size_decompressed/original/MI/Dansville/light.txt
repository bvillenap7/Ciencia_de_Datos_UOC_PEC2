Triple lights in the sky.;2020-09-03 20:00:00;10 seconds;Triple lights in the sky. Driving from Dansville Michigan to Mason Michigan.  I was with my wife and child.  Saw two UFO's in the sky.  Each had triple lights in a straight line with a haze around them.  Moved around and then disappeared.  I initially thought this was a drone.  But two of them in tandem with triple lights is very unlikely.  Right at sunset wife and I both saw it.;42.5527;-84.2923
