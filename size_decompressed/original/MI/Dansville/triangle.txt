It had three lights in the shape of a triangle and the lights would occasionally blink.  We figured it was just some kid with a drone (even though it was late at night).  But then a few more showed up.  Still, at about four drones we figured it was just some people joking around. The only buildings that would be in the range of a small drone were the school, the fire department, an auto repair shop and a few houses.  There didn't appear to be anyone walking around either. And, we couldn't hear any sound coming from these drones. When we started to get creeped out is when we counted 50 of these things.  They were coming from all directions and just circling us.  They remained stationary in the sky probably about 30 feet above our heads.  We couldn't make out any details other than the lights. More drones continued coming seemingly at random over the next hour. That's when we finally decided to leave.;42.5527;-84.2923
