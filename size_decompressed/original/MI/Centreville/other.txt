Maybe you can tell me what I actually saw.  I was pulling out of the parking lot of the college I attend and saw a sparkler type light. The best way to describe the way it moved is like a child with a Fourth of July white light sparkler moving it in their hand while walking around. That is how the light moved Monday night (9-19-05, 9:00 pm). When I first saw the light I thought, “That is not an airplane light.” The light was not moving straight and slow or straight and fast  or hovering, it was jagged, jerking movement, at a medium pace speed. It went over the college parking lot and headed toward the town. A few times it looked as though the light had stopped and then comeback like it was losing power.  I followed it to the end of the college drive and turned the opposite way, thinking no one will believe me anyway if I tell them about it.  I wondered if it was a meteorological device or some sort of radio-controlled camera. I could not justify those descriptions because the light was so bright and it literally was a giant sparkler.;41.9212;-85.4991
