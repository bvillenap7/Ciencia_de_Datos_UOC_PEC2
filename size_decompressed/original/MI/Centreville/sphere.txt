Before it completed an arc, just before the horizon to the north,  it appeared to straighen it's course and move in a northwest direction, thus moving out of it's arc movement.   The lake is approximatly one quarter mile wide from north to south so this object was moving quite slow, slower than planes we have observed and there was no sound.  Five adults witnessed this and it also appeard to have a orange glow around the red sphere. The writer of this, first spotted it and observed a similar light on the same lake about in 1965.;41.9212;-85.4991
