Orange fireball shot over lake in Lewiston Michigan;2020-08-11 22:03:00;30 seconds;Orange fireball shot over lake in Lewiston Michigan On August 11th 2020, the Perseids were shooting over the sky. My family and I were staying on a lake with virtually no light pollution so every night we would go out and watch the meteors. On this night, at around 10pm, I was looking over the lake when I saw an orange (what can only be described as a fireball) shooting over the sky, but it went over slowly.  It wasn't a meteor because of how slow it went over the lake. It took around 30 seconds to be out of eyesight.  My brother, mother, and father all saw this ufo, and we have no idea what they are.;44.8544;-84.2923
