I was looking out our bedroom window watching the sky and saw this object through the haze. It was crystal clear last night, that's why I really noticed this haze.  It was oval shaped with white lights that would get very bright and then get very dim, like a very slow pulsing light.  What really got me was all the other little lights flying around it.  I asked my husband to look at it and he couldn't figure out what it was either.  It was stationery and all these other little lights were buzzing around it.  It reminded both of us of moths flying around a light bulb.  There was no set pattern to their flight and it looked like some of them flew into this thing.  We watched it for about 45 minutes and it didn't do anything else so we went to sleep as we have to get up early and it was almost 12:45 a.m.  I got up a few hours later and looked to see if it was still there, and it was gone.  No haze, no lights, nothing.  I guess what really made us notice this thing was because of the haze that surrounded it..  There was no other haze around and neither one of us had ever seen anything that looked like that.  Sure would like to know what it was.  If I see it again I will definitely try and get a picture of it with my digital camera.;44.8544;-84.2923
