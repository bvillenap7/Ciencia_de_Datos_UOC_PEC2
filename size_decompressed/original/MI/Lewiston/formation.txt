32 Satellites?  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-07 18:15:00;5+ minutes;32 Satellites? Last night in northern Michigan it was a clear sky and I happened to look up at the moon, thatâ€™s when I noticed an extremely bright white light flashing with no sound, slowly moving across the sky to the northeast.  As I continued to watch the light, I noticed what appeared to be a satellite heading southeast.  Directly behind the first object, in single file, precisely spaced, followed a total of 32 objects.  Again, there was no sound, I assumed they were satellites.  Concerning, yet interesting.;44.8544;-84.2923
