Power interrruption, glinting in the blue sky and several odd photographs taken of round, metallic object.(s);2007-08-11 15:05:00;five minutes;Power interrruption, glinting in the blue sky and several odd photographs taken of round, metallic object.(s) At approx. 3pm EST the power flickered in my Clarklake, MI (Jackson County) home.   After a moment of thinking what possibly could've made my power momentary interruption, I instinctfully, without prior thought, grabbed my camera and went outdoors to photograph the daturas in my garden.  I am a semi-professional designer and amateur photographer and have been recently posting photos in a Flickr.com account.    As I began to set up my SLR-type Sony Cybershot DSC-H5, I saw a flash in the NW skies, toward Jackson, MI (it is now about five minutes after the power flicker).   I set the camera to auto and 'burst' two series of five photographs.   Immediately I viewed them through the camera's 3-inch lighted view screen and saw one image with a definite black dot infront of a small cloud.   At that point I went indoors and downloaded the images onto my computer and found that there were at least two objects, one definitely metallic and disc-shaped, flitting about the skies.;42.123;-84.3533
