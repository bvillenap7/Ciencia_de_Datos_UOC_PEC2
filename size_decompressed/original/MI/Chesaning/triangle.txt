Purple plasma light and triangular craft;2020-03-15 21:05:00;30 minutes;Purple plasma light and triangular craft At approximately 9:05 PM on March 15, 2020 my son was in my backyard with his dog.  He saw a strange white light flying high in the night sky.  He decided to record it with his phone.  While following the white light he began to notice a purple plasma type light forming in the northeastern sky.  The white light flew into the purple light.  The purple light quickly disappeared. He came into the house and told my husband and I about his experience.  He showed us the video.  We asked him to take us outside and show us where he saw the purple light.  When looking into the sky we saw what seemed to be dozens of small white lights traveling from the west to the east.  They were not like the train of lights you would see with Starlink.  They were kind of scattered and far apart.  Some skipped across the sky while others were smooth and steady all heading in the direction where the purple light had been.  We watched the lights for about 10 to 15 minutes.  They were ! gone.  Confused and in awe of what we had all seen, we kept staring into the sky.  After 10 minutes or more we saw a massive triangular shaped craft coming from the east.  It flew as high as a jumbo jet but was almost translucent, but not.  It's hard to explain.  We are trying to reason what we saw, but just can't;43.1837;-84.1151
