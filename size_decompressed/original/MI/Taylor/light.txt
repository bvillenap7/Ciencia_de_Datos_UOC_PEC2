7-1-12 Orange lights spotted over Taylor,Mi  near Metro Airport;2012-07-01 22:30:00;45 seconds;7-1-12 Orange lights spotted over Taylor,Mi  near Metro Airport I was in my backyard watching firework's on all sides of me.(Near Metro Airport over Taylor,Mi) I looked up to the West and saw 2 orange light's heading East (toward's me).  The lights were traveling low and slow, no sound was heard at all.    I hurried inside, to get my wife, I felt like I needed somebody to tell me that what I was seeing was real!   When I came back outside I was the first one there, just in time to see the (balls of light) go behind a large cottonwood tree!   So my wife nor any of my 3 daughters,that followed me outside,saw anything.  My wife may think I'm crazy, but I know I saw something unexplainable.  I watched that tree for 1- 1-1/2 and never saw the lights re-emerge!  They just disappeared.  What the heck?  Just wondering if anybody else out there witnessed the same thing?  I know I am not crazy.;42.2316;-83.2659
