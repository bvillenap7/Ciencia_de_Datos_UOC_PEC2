She and her cousin were sitting on the front porch, this was around midnight.   My neighbor came running in the house yelling for me to hurry come outside, there's a UFO!   I ran outside and looked in the direction they were pointing, and sure enough, there was an object hovering in the sky.   I could not really make out the shape of the object but, it appeared to have a string or bar of white lights on it.  The lights were not flashing or anything.  It was just hovering there, no noise or anything.   Then it slowly began to move behind the trees and we lost sight of it. Just after it went out of sight, a commercial airplane flew by moving a lot quicker than the object we just witnessed.  So, we are positive it was not a plane.;42.2316;-83.2659
