I went out to watch fireworks about 10:30 PM I saw an orange red object slowly coming from the north.  I wondered what kind of plane it was because I had never saw a plane like that.  When it got over me it went strait up and out of sight in a few seconds. I went in and told my wife that I thought I had just seen a UFO? I went back out and two more were coming from the same spot,  I called my wife to come out but by the time she got there they were gone.   As she started back in, a fourth one was coming from the same area and she also watched it disappear.;42.2316;-83.2659

The object stayed almost motionless for about ten minutes, while I talked to a co-worker on the phone.  I had a telephone pole as a point of reference to tell it wasn’t moving.  I got off the phone and viewed it through binoculars in which it looked metallic.  It was moving southwest and the wind was blowing around 20mph to the east.  I saw an aircraft pass it rapidly from north to south that didn’t look like a commercial airliner.  That was odd because airport traffic was moving east and west because of the wind direction.  I viewed the object for about for about 30 min till it moved out of sight. I think what ever flew by it was checking it out because it flew right between air traffic from metro airport.  I took photo and video with my phone of it but you cannot see much detail in the object.;42.2316;-83.2659
