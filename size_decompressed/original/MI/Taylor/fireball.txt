Red fiery object witnessed by 3 adults.;2012-01-06 09:15:00;2min;Red fiery object witnessed by 3 adults. My dad, brother, and I were outside in his driveway sitting by a fire when we saw a fiery object coming from the west.  At first we thought it was an airplane on fire because he lives close to an airport.  Then we thought it was debris from space but we didnt see any debris.  It was silent as it flew over.  The object came out of the clouds, flew directly over our heads and went back into the clouds.  My brother tried to take a picture with his phone but it didn't come out.  It flew at exactly 79 degrees east because we looked at the compass on his phone headed towards Canada.  We haven't called the airport yet to see if they saw something on radar.  It is something we can't explain.;42.2316;-83.2659
green streak across sky.;2012-06-14 21:30:00;3seconds;green streak across sky. Driving on Phelham/Allen Road it was almost fully dark and kind of cloudy. I was going North when I looked up to the right slightly and I saw what looked like a green light or fireball shape streak down at an angle and disappear. I thought maybe it was fire works so I continued looking around to see if there was more but I saw none, the light reminded me of a shooting star, seemed to have a tail light when it disappeared, fireworks do not just disappear like that, was a weird experience for me.
