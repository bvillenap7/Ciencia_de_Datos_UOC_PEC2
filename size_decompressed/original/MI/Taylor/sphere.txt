As I walked toward the building, some very bright lights caught my attention, because the October sky was already dark at around 6:30pm.   I looked up and saw these objects that looked like the size of basketballs, almost burning but not burning out.  A combination of about 6 to 8 possibly all like floating close together. They had trails behind them, they were almost golden like but, extremely bright and they made a sizzeling type noise. They floated by rather quickly.  There were people that had walked to their cars so they had there backs to this scene, I turned to try to say something to them, but I didn't want to take my eyes off the objects, they were so beautiful.  I'm surprised that the brightness didn't get their attention.   A man and woman farther down the mall were  walking to their car.  I saw the man look up and see these objects too.  They floated East and disappeared quickly. The whole time period was only about 20 seconds or so. I'm sorry to report this so late, but when I went to look for a website, I couldn't find one, or maybe I just wasn't too familiar with looking for sites on the web. I will never forget what I saw.  I don't know if this info is even relevant any longer, since it happened years ago. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));42.2316;-83.2659
