Symbols on bottom in Michigan;1978-06-30 21:00:00;5 mins.;Symbols on bottom in Michigan Craft was low enough to see symbols on it, like Egypt writing and engraved.  Craft had a low humming sound and was as big as two houses.  Craft was like metal golden color but not shiny.  Whole neighborhood was outside watching.   Spotlight was moving around on the houses.  Multi-colored pulsing lights between bottom edge and fullsize windows around whole curcumference of the craft.   Felt no heat and craft was directly above my house and me.  Presence of Airforce arriving and observing the craft must have caused the craft to leave and the Airforce tried to follow.   Craft left what seemed like instanly without sound or heat.   My friend who was staying the night went home terrified. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));42.2316;-83.2659
