A low-flying triangular aircraft.;2011-07-21 22:10:00;5 mins.;A low-flying triangular aircraft. While traveling S in Allegan County (between Byron Center and Dorr) my girlfriend and I noticed an object with 3 yellow/white lights flying SE. The lights were positioned as such: one light on the left extremity, one directly in the center, and one on the right extremity.  I use the word extremity because the object had no wings the object was basically a triangle.  The object disappeared momentarily behind the tree-line when it came back into sight, the lights on either extremity had been replaced by the standard red and green aviation colored lights.  When the object first appeared we approximate its angle of elevation to be 40 degrees.  The object made no aerial maneuvers, stayed its course traveling SE the entire time we viewed it.   We watched the object for less than 5 minutes, until it flew out of our range of vision.   The prevailing winds at the time were moving SW at approx. 8 mph.;42.8003;-85.7093000000002
