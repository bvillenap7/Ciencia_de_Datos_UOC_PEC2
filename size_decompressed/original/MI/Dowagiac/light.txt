3 lights at the leading edge of an approaching storm;2008-06-08 15:00:00;2 minutes;3 lights at the leading edge of an approaching storm 08June2008 approx 15:00  Just after  the sirens for a tornado warning, 3 white lights were seen by my husband and myself , at the leading edge of the storm.  The 3 lights were clumped together and then split with 1 leading and 2 following. They vanished into the approaching storm. They were moving north to south, just West of Dowagiac.  We watched them for about 2 minutes.  It may have been birds with light glinting off of them, but at that point there was no sunshine.;41.9943;-86.1158999999999
