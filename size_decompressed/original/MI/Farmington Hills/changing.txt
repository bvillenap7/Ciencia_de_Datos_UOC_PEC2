A silent flying/ hovering dark object that changed shape and lacked lights or color.;2000-06-17 21:40:00;10 minutes plus;A silent flying/ hovering dark object that changed shape and lacked lights or color. We were playing catch outside and my son looked up and said a UFO.  We watched it slowly approach us and when neither of us could identify it I sent him in to get my binoculors.  Even with the binoculors we could not make out what it was.  It seemed to change shape.  It hovered in one spot for a few minutes and then seem to make a small circle and then hover again.  It then was not there.  We thought that it may have been a flock of geese but it was too large and solid.  We also thought it may have been a parasailor/sailors but we could not identife any people plus it stayed in one spot or went up.  A Plane went by but not in the direction of the object.;42.5062929733717;-83.4067130917175
