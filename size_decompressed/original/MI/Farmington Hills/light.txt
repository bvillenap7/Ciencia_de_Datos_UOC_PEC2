I witnessed what appeared to be at very high altitude, short chemtrails with some sort of craft in front of them.  The chemtrails appeared to be very short and perfectly straight.  The chemtrails were scattered and were positioned and different angles and altitudes.  The color of these chemtrails were an orange and white and the closest one seemed to emit heat.  The number of them increased from 7 to about 13 then up to 20.  Then they disappeared suddenly and without a trace from 20 to 13 to 7 and down to one.  The last one disappeared instantly.  I could not make out what shape the craft in front of the lights were.  They were without movement and the chemtrails never increased or decreased in size.
