Series of red lights moving in a wave-like line.;2011-01-01 00:00:00;appx. 15 mins;Series of red lights moving in a wave-like line. Shortly after midnight I saw a ‘string’ of red lights forming an undulating wave-like line in the sky.  The lights moved slowly and I thought they were planes but they were too close together to be planes and did not move in a straight line.  The lights moved from south to west and appeared in the lower half of the eastern horizon. My husband came over and watched as well and we could not figure out what it could possibly be.  I called the police station in the morning to see if they had had any calls.  They did not report any other calls and did not offer any explanations as to the source of the lights.;42.5062929733717;-83.4067130917175
