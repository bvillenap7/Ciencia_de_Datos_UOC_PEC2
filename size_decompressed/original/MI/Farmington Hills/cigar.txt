Metallic cigar shaped at one end, rectangle at the other end. Hovering, no sound.;2013-09-27 08:30:00;5 seconds;Metallic cigar shaped at one end, rectangle at the other end. Hovering, no sound. Driving south on Orchard Lake Rd. approaching 12 mile rd. Saw a metallic object hovering about approximately 100 yards in the sky, sort of cigar shaped at one end, the other end was more like a rectangle.  Looked like a big metallic heating/cooling duct, with segmented pieces.  Approx 40-50 feet long, 10-15 feet high.  No sound.  No lights.  No jet propulsion, or helicopter blades I could see. It was just hovering.  I wasn't the only one that saw it.  It stopped traffic and I looked at the guy stopped next to me and we shrugged at each other.  I looked back, and it was gone.
