5 am and noticed an obj. that resembles a star but was very much bigger and brighter than star.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet?  PD));2011-12-01 05:00:00;until daylight;Got up early this morning at almost 5 am and noticed an object that resembles a star but was very much bigger and brighter than the stars that were in the sky.  It had constant flickering light and was lower than the stars in the sky.  I didnt have to focus on it it so much to tell that it was moving.  It moved up and down and it a circular motion at times in one spot, and at times a little over to the side. by almost daylight it had moved so much that it was much further away than where it was when I first saw it like heading towards Center Rd.   There was also another one like that but it was smaller and adjacent to the other.  It was moving as well. I had seen things like this before and now it seems others are starting to say theyve seen similar things too.  Am starting to see it more often now.  Power in the whole area was out for some strange reason. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet?
