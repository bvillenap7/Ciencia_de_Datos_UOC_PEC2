Unknown ball of light that has smaller ball of light going around it for two nights straight!;2011-10-07 22:00:00;2 nights;Unknown ball of light that has smaller ball of light going around it for two nights straight! On the night of October 7, 2011, at 10:00 p.m. I went outside and I was looking at the stars,  then I noticed a ball of light with a smaller ball of light in the sky,  I had my dad, mom, and girlfriend come outside and look at it,  after that it split into about 6 different balls of light, then regrouped as one big light and a smaller ball of light. It stayed in the same spot until 1:30a.m.  Then between 2:30 and 3:00 it had moved to a higher spot in the sky.   Then on the night of October 8, 2011 went outside at 9:00 and it was in the sky at a lower point then the night before.  It still has a smaller ball of light going around it then behind it.  It seems to be like a team of two.  It also moves, but keeping the smaller ball of light going around and behind it.;42.9860611111111;-83.6443333333334
