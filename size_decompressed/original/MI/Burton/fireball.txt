Fireball flies in the sky;2008-07-05 22:45:00;15 minutes;Fireball flies in the sky At about 10:45pm on Saturday July 5th at the corner of Atherton and Center roads we saw a ball of fire with a glow around it about 100 to 200 yards above us not moving. It then slowly drifted east then shifted quickly southwest. It stopped for a minute then quickly rose up into the atmosphere until it looked like a bright star. It then started moving North until it disappeared as it approached the Big Dipper.;42.9860611111111;-83.6443333333334
Orange Fire Ball;2011-07-06 22:00:00;5 minuets;Orange Fire Ball July 6th, 2011, me and my daughter were headed home from Wal-Mart,  when we pulled into our driveway  my 11 year old daughter asked me what the orange light in the sky was.  I looked up, but in a different direction and only seen an airplane.  Then she proceeded to tell me, no mom, look this way!  I turned and never have I seen an object like this before.  It was orange and compared to the other airplanes in the sky it would have been 10 times bigger than an average airplane.   First I thought it may be a weather balloon like always assumed, but when it went up and down and backwards then out of sight I was in shock!   Never in my life have I seen something like this.  And we live in the city, where I thought nothing happens here.  Boy was I wrong!   Thatâ€™s what we have seen and I hope that if anyone in my area has seen the same sighting please let me know!   Thank you!;42.9860611111111;-83.6443333333334
