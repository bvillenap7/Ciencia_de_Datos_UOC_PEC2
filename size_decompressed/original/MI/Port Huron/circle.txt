They moved at a speed that seemed just under the speed of a plane.  It was clear with slight cloud coverage.From what I could tell, both saucers were white but off white and enough to see them clearly in the sky.;42.9882086956521;-82.4459891304347
Small circular/disk shaped object w/ red and green flashing lights.;2019-03-29 22:00:00;5 minutes;small circular/disk shaped object w/ red and green flashing lights Around 9:30-10:00 p.M. i heard what i thought was a helicopter or airplane very close to my home..  i looked out a window and was confused and frightened by what appeared to be a very small ufo flying in a fairly straight line right over a tree in my backyard..  the red and green lights pulsating around it is what caught my attention or i probably would've missed it..  i stared at it for a few seconds trying to figure out if i was looking at a drone because it really was small..  i'd say it appeared to be about the size of a kite(?), but no more than 3 ft in diameter.  but then i got a very uneasy and panicky type feeling and moved away from the window.  i then felt the need to protect my son so i sat near him(he is 9 and was sleeping).  i don't know why i was so frightened because it was much smaller than i imagined a ufo be and also because (although i never actually saw it) i think the helicopter was a distraction.;42.9882086956521;-82.4459891304347
