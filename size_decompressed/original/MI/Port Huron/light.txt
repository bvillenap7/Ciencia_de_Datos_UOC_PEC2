I also notice another very bright object slightly to the north of the Planet Jupiter same apparent magnitude and wondered which planet could it be?  As I watched the other bright object I noticed that it was now moving to the north. I thought maybe it might be the international space station and seemed to be moving at the same apparent speed as when I had seem International Space station fly over the Port Huron area earlier this year. As I watched the Bright moving object I noticed that it appeared to be fading as it moved as though it was moving upwards as well as moving northward.  It was at this time I ran back inside to get my 10x50 binoculars to get a better look at this object. My binoculars were just inside the doorway sitting on my lap table and by thee time I got back outside the bright object was nowhere insight. I thought maybe that maybe clouds might have been obscuring my view and causing this apparent movement, but I noticed I was still seeing the backgrounds stars and the once bright object was now completely out of sight. As a FAA licensed Commercial Pilot and backyard Astronomer I know the night skies and most man-made objects flying in them. This was a most unusual brief sighting of something unknown to me!;42.9882086956521;-82.4459891304347
3 white lights hovering then slowly diminished one by one.;2014-07-04 22:30:00;5 minutes;3 white lights hovering then slowly diminished one by one. Was taking the trash out and we looked north and saw 3 white lights that were much larger than a star or planet, when we first noticed them they were in somewhat if a triangular formation just hovering in the same area but you could tell there was very slow movement, moving in a random pattern.  There was no blinking like an aircraft and obviously not shooting stars since they were just hovering.  Then as we watched one by one the lights slowly diminished until they were gone.  I've been checking the news to see if there were any other reports but I haven't seen anything yet.  But I noticed here several people saw strange lights the same night.;42.9882086956521;-82.4459891304347

I thought it might of been something on the lens of the cam. But it then moved a bit. It lasted all night till morning i have the tape if interested. Also note the next day i went into the yard to see where it was. And it was right where a tree use to be in our yard. Once in the circle in our yard i felt confused and disoriented and then felt a pressure in my nose and felt the urge to build a totum poll with alien symbols on it.;42.9882086956521;-82.4459891304347
