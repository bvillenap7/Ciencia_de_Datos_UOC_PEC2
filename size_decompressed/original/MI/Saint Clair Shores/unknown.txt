Apprx. one minute to traverse the sky. On Saturday evening 8/7/2010 at 2135 hours, my friend and were seated on an outdoor patio in the Detroit area and witnessed an object of indeterminate shape rising from the SW or SSW treeline. The object was a very bright orange-yellow and I at first thought it might have been an aircraft with its landing lights on.  Its magnitude was far brighter than Sirius.  It is difficult to gauge the size of the object but I would estimate it as subtending half the angle as does a light plane at very high altitude. From our vantage point, looking in a NNW direction, the object was at about 45 degrees from the horizon. We heard no sound, saw no trail and watched it trace an arc for about one minute before it dipped below the trees in the NE or NNE. It appeared to have maintained the same level of brightness throughout its trajectory, ruling out any landing lights.   At the time I speculated that it could have been a space vehicle during re-entry.  The object seemed far to! o bright to have been reflecting sunlight and the time was 50 minutes past sunset. I called Selfridge ANG base and spoke with a colonel in the Air Museum but he could provide no information they had no reports of a sighting. I checked the Space Shuttle schedule and ruled out that possibility.  I then contacted our local TV stations and had the same result.  I spoke with our TV weatherman, who seemed very interested but he also had no reports of any such phenomenon.  He checked on the wind direction for the time of the object's transit but the high altitude winds were in a direction almost opposite that which would account for a weather balloon as an explanation.;42.4903463414634;-82.8970121951219
Starfighters;2019-11-06 01:30:00;0.5 second;Starfighters I was once again out walking.  Geometry was never my strong suit.  I will say I saw an object very far away while walking west whiz diagonally from northeast position in my view to southwest position.  This happened extremely fast and the object would've been traveling at a speed that I could only refer to as warp speed.  The object was very far away so I have no idea of any shape.  This was NOT a meteor or something.  he object was in a still position according to my view before this occurred.  Once again, it happened so fast. It appeared it would crash based on trajectory but I have no idea.  Due to my late-night walking I tend to see things all the time.  Lots going on up there.  I have no doubts.;42.4903463414634;-82.8970121951219
