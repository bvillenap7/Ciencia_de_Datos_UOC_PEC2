Stationary triangle banked in front of us then glided away;2007-04-19 21:20:00;1 minute;Stationary triangle banked in front of us then glided away It was a nice clear night on the east side of Detroit, the moon was waxing in the west.  I had just picked up my friend from his house, and as we turned a corner looking ESE we simultaneously said Whoa!.   Nearly stationary in front of us at about 1,000 feet over Lake St. Clair was a formation of lights.  There were 5 of them in a line at about a 45 degree angle, as if an airliner was banking in front of us with an array of lights on it's wings.  The center light was the brightest.   We followed the same direction and watched as the craft banked north and it's bottom faced us.  What we both saw was a triangle of yellow lights with a white flashing light at it's rear.   As it headed north, light after light went out until there were two blue lights at it's tips and then it disappeared past the trees faster than we could keep up with it.   I spend a lot of time looking at the sky.  We have a couple major airports in our area as well as a National Guard Base.  I have seen a lot of lights from all kinds of aircraft, and this was the first time I've looked up and questioned anything I have ever seen before.  My friend was in as much surprise as myself.   It defied all logic of modern aircraft that I have witnessed.  It was as large as a 747, yet behaved like a slow helicopter with no sound.   I would love to know if anyone else in the area saw anything similar.;42.4903463414634;-82.8970121951219
Unlit, dark triangle shape craft moved very quickly across horizon at moderate altitude in a westerly heading.;2008-08-24 22:00:00;10 SECONDS;Unlit, dark triangle shape craft moved very quickly across horizon at moderate altitude in a westerly heading. I was standing outside on my cell phone.  I saw a dark triangle-shaped craft flying from east to west.  It was isosceles in shape, with a very acute front angle.  The craft was dark, unlit, and silent.  I saw no propulsion flames and only a slight thermal glow to its leading edge.  Still it crossed my visible horizon in under 10 seconds.  The craft appeared not overly large, on par with a small commercial jet and was flying at a relatively low altitude,  maybe 15,000 feet.  At about 2/3 of the way across my horizon, it slid over rapidly to its port side, maybe twice the width of the craft, but continued on its same course.
