Bright green/red LED type light moving very fast and performing unusual manuevers with multiple witnesses.;2013-12-28 20:30:00;5-10 minutes;Bright green/red LED type light moving very fast and performing unusual manuevers with multiple witnesses My son, his neighbor, his niece, his brother-in-law and myself were on the front porch of brother-in-law's house.  A bright light resembling an LED, somewhat shimmering red and green but not flashing or blinking, came from behind us overhead. It moved in a very direct line, quickly, from southwest to northeast.  I would guess an altitude of 1-3 miles.  At a point about 5 miles from us, it came to an abrupt stop.  It then made several squarish maneuvers in a small area and then stopped again.  Each time it stopped it was for about 30 seconds. It then proceeded south, quickly again, and came to a stop again.  It performed the same moves as mentioned.  It then dropped straight down until it was out of sight because of homes nearby.  I would estimate that it dropped in the area over Lake St Clair. The weather was very clear and dark and cold.  No cloud cover.  There were several aircraft also visible.  This made the comparison very stark.  It seemed to all of us that this object was not at all similar to any standard aircraft, including helicopters. I am a retired construction company owner from NC. My son is head of facilities maintenance at Coleman Young Itn'l Airport.  The neighbor works for GM and the brother-in-law is a route salesman.  The niece is about 13 yrs old. to the best of my knowledge everyone there has a reasonable education. Nobody was drunk or on drugs. During the episode we also called out several others (4-5 more people) that were visiting inside.  All adults.  They also watched but only for a minute or so.;42.4903463414634;-82.8970121951219

It was not a aircraft .  This area is on the approach to Detroit s airport and close to Sefrage Air Base, but the object was much too low, also aircraft do not use blue only white green and red.;42.4903463414634;-82.8970121951219
