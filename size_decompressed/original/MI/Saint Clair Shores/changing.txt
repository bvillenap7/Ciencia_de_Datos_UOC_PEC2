Only visible when skies are clear at night  It started around 4/10/15 and the date is currently 4/22/15.   Bright white light, slowly rotating and hovering, disguises itself as a star or plane sometimes.  Usually is in the same spot but will disappear and reappear in the same spot or will move locations.  I see it outside of my friend's house and from my house and we live 15 minutes away.   On 4/18/15, me and my two friends witnessed it and managed to get a photograph of it.  In the photo it did not look the same as it did to our eyes.  There appears to be three lights in a triangle shape.  Two of the lights are blue and one is yellow.;42.4903463414634;-82.8970121951219
