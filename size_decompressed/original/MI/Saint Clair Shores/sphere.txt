Observed a spherical object fly from south to north. Shere color was either black or dark grey, and appeared to rotate. It also appeared that it emitted some type of light or reflected the morning light. Object appeared to be 1 to 2 miles away and travelling a little faster than normal aircraft. I was working the night shift at an area marina as night security. The night was nice with no weather to report that night or morning. The skies were clear and it was a beautiful sunrise. I was standing on the easternmost part of the marina (a large beach type of area strewn with large and small pieces of broken concrete). I looked up to the west, north west and observed what appeared to be a rather large sphere shaped object travelling from south to the north, maybe northeast about 1 to 2 miles away. It was possibly black or dark grey in color and possibly rotating. I say possibly rotating because as it flew on there was some type of either light or streak on it that appeared to rotate around the object end over end. The object was travelling somewhat faster than any aircraft in the area that morning. There was a small private plane that was approximately 5 to 10 miles away to the south travelling west, at what speed I do not know. I looked back to the object and noticed there were no smoke or vapor trails which would have been noticeable in the morning sky. I looked around the sky to see if I could see any type of military aircraft following or attempting to intercept, since Selfridge Air National Guard Base is approximately 5 to 7 miles north of the marina I was at. I saw nothing else in the sky. When I looked back to the object, it had disappeared. I contacted the CoastGaurd about 2 minutes later when I returned to the Gatehouse and asked if they had recieved any type of reports of unusual things in the air and they replied NO. After this I did not attempt any other reporting for fear of being completely criticized and also possibly losing my job which, at that time, I could not afford to do.;42.4903463414634;-82.8970121951219
