As I looked up,I saw a metallic disc shaped craft,hovering roughly 90ft.up.The craft had 2 windows & a oval shaped structure on the bottom which had an array of light which appeared to be rotating.Almost Immediately as I looked up at It,I saw two humanoid like beings staring downward at me.The beings had larger heads than humans,they wore robed clothing,and were about five to six tall.  The background or interior of the craft was Illuminated In a bright yellowish light.I'd estimate the craft was about 35 to 40 ft.in length & 15 to 20 ft.wide.The object just hovered emitting a deep hum-like sound.The exterior of the craft was metallic In nature having a dull luster,somewhat shiny though.  About 30 to 45 seconds Into the sighting a third being appeared in front of the shipswindow,now there were three beings glaring downward at me.Then about ten seconds later one being,with it's hand gave something small to the other one.As I watched,all three aliens were staring downward at me,which caused some concern,I was thinking something bad was going to happen.My next move was to quickly run into my house & I told my mother about the sighting,which to no avail she didn't believe me.

I looked to my left and seen a hooving silver object with a few different colored lights hooving stationary in the sky about 200-300ft in the air that made no sound at all, i was in shock by what i was seeing and didnt say anything to my friend laying next to me. I watched it about 3-5 minutes and it did a slow semi spiral turn and shot off to the right or southwest towards lake st clair several hundred mph. After it was gone my friend said did you just see that we sat outside and thought about what we seen and ran inside scared to death. I remember it clear as day and my friend has too all these years. It was NOT anything ive ever seen before and never would of noticed it had i not looked up. It made no sound whatsoever, was shaped like movie flying saucers, it was mindblowing and noone has ever believed me but my w! itness friend who seen it to.;42.4903463414634;-82.8970121951219
