I watched a orange ball of light that was flickering travel in a straight line from horizon to horizon and almost directly over head as it passed my location.  It was lower than the cloud that was directly over head also. It is hard to guess at the size and speed with nothing to compare it to but I think it was twice or maybe three times the size of a jumbo jet and it was moving very fast.  I decided as I saw it coming to not try to use my phone cam or run to get a cam, I decided to observe the best I could and it passed so close that I got a really good look at it.  The flickering of the orange light seemed to appear as a distortion of some kind, not fire, and I could see a structure inside. I could not see the structure well but I very well saw straight lines of a structure, a few straight lines parallel to each other.  It was perfectly round as it appeared round coming towards me, above me, and leaving me. I can only guess, but I think the flickering is a time or space distortion and perhaps that is its propulsion system. It made absolutely no noise at all.
