One was heading west, the other heading east toward Lake St. Clair.  This was over St. Clair Shores / Grosse Point Woods, MI.  They were very shiny, white, and appeared to have a dark non-reflective band around the middle.  We saw the one slowly turn southbound, then head west again.  The other remained heading east.  Definitely cylindrical with no wings and super reflective. Even at 8pm, it was still very bright and sunny.  They made no sound and left no trails of any kind.  We watched them for what felt  like 3 to 5 minutes until they were out of sight.  Within minutes of seeing these two things, an orange coast guard helicopter circled over the area, coincidentally or not.  We just assumed they are some kind of experimental craft or drones as we are in close proximity to Selfridge ANGB.  I found this YouTube video taken by someone else, somewhere else, of EXACTLY what we saw up in the sky.  EXACTLY the same thing, except we saw TWO. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXJTgmWM000  Wondering what these are, I thought I'd share.  Cheers.
