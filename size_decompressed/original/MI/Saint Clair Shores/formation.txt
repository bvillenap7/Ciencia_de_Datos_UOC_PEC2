I saw roundish, very bright balls of light with tails.  They were flying all in a row and there were about 10-15 of them.  All of a sudden outside our window about 100 feet away, going west to east was a bright light that got my attention.  When I immediately looked out I saw almost out of nowhere were these balls of light with tails flying totally in a straight line.  I've never seen anything like it.  I proceded to call the St. Clair Shores police dept. to ask if anyone else had seen what I saw.  They said they didn't have any other reports.  I then called my mom, two girlfriends(that I didn't get ahold of) and my fiance and described what I saw.  I was then informed about the metior showers but it didn't look like that to me.  It was going west to east horizontally in a line, not vertically.  My mom then heard the program on the radio and called me to tell me other people saw exactly what I saw and they were describing it on the radio.  I live in Southeast lower Michigan and someone said at 19:04 someone reported it in Northern Michigan. I also called our local T.V. station to report what I saw after hearing the radio broadcast.;42.4903463414634;-82.8970121951219

I was able to catch another glimpse of it through a break in the clouds. The formation did not change. The string of lights were heading East over Blossom Heath Park.;42.4903463414634;-82.8970121951219
