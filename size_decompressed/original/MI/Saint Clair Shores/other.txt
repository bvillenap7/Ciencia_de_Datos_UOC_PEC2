Bright Flash of Light in Night Sky.;2015-09-14 22:25:00;2 seconds;Bright Flash of Light in Night Sky I have been observing a single super bright flash of light lasting one to two seconds from my patio in the NW sky for most of the month of September.  I have observed it on about a dozen occasions, generally within the same sky space with some slight deviations of placement.  Because I have seen it regularly, I am unsure if it is flashing continually throughout the night. I have attempted communication via responding flashes of light utilizing a 1,000,000 candlepower portable hand held light.  No response. I attempted to locate it with 10X50 Binoculars and have seen nothing in the area where the flash occurred. I theorize it is possible but unlikely that it is Google or Government Satellite taking high resolution photographs of detailed portions of smaller incremental areas of Earth but cannot understand why at night or the need for a flash.
