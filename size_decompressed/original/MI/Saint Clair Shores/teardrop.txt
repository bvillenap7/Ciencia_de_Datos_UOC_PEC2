Another One Drops On Us! And another one drops....and another one.....;2019-08-15 01:28:00;2-3 seconds;Another One Drops On Us!  And another one drops....and another one..... I was walking north on a street in Saint Clair Shores and stopped on the sidewalk for a reason I will not identify.  I was looking up at some trees.  Suddenly, an orb of white color or circle dropped nearly straight down.  I would estimate at about 250-260 degrees. The object then went unnoticed or disappeared.  It would have still been in my site but went dark.  There were 2 clouds above where it dropped from in my vision.  They went dark on an angle of me looking at the top of a telephone pole about 30 yards ahead of me.  I can not estimate the altitude before the drop. This is my 3rd sighting (just in this area) and I've lived in the area for a short time (exact time not to be given).  Selfridge Air Force Base is about a ten minute drive from here and is North as well. I have reported sightings in the past.  I think since I'm nocturnal (and outside at night) I run into these more often than most people.  This object did not drop at the speed I've seen others drop in my opinion.  Fast but not as fast.  Either that, or I'm speeding up. That's about it.  I saw one over Lake St. Clair a few months back dropping in a similar manner.  I didn't report that one.;42.4903463414634;-82.8970121951219
