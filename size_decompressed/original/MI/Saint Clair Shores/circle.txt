Two low flying UFOs;2010-04-04 01:00:00;15 sec;two low flying UFOs At one o’clock in the morning on Easter two or three years ago, in Saint Clair Shores Michigan, while sneaking a cigarette behind my garage and letting my dog go bathroom.  I was standing facing south looking up at the stars on a cloudless night and I witnessed two flying saucers flying east to west in typical wingman formation. I was unable to tell how large they were because I had nothing to judge them against.  However, if I had to guess I’d say 75 feet in diameter and maybe 200 feet above the ground.  If I had to guess speed I’d say 75mph. I watched them until they disappeared into the western horizon.  The most unique thing about them was 1st they certainly silverfish metallic and very similar to the typical flying saucers portrayed in the 1950’s science fiction movies. 2nd they both had pulsating lights around the bottom part, but the one in the forward position on the north side had a reddish light and the craft itself certainly had a wobble as it flew, the other craft on the southern side with maybe a crafts distance between them had a pulsating bluish light and no wobble.  After watching them as long as I could, I called my wife’s phone, she was asleep in the house to tell her what I had seen, the phone call had  a lot of static that since then I have been unable to duplicate when standing in the same area.  The craft made no noise and flew in a straight path making no course corrections.;42.4903463414634;-82.8970121951219
Lights Spinning Slowly for a moment then zoomed north.;2020-06-29 22:30:00;5-6 seconds;Lights Spinning Slowly for a moment then zoomed north. I was laying on my swing on the porch, and suddenly I noticed 4 bright, Squarish lights spinning in a circle very slowly for about one turn.  Suddenly it shot north towards New Baltimore area, and had a white trail left that I couldn't see reappear anywhere on the horizon.  It showed up almonst around 90 degrees from where I was sitting, and the streak when it left probably went about 10 degrees before disappearing.  Couldn't really tell a size on it, if I held my hand up, it was about the size of my pinky finger nail, which would put the distance between where helicopters fly and airplanes fly. There was only the one, and I didn't see what else it could be. I do live near Selfridge Airport, and by a Lake coast, so we do see lots of planes and helicopters. But this was like nothing I've seen before.  I've never been opposed to thinking something else exists, but I also never went looking for answers until I saw that. It was not any light like a meteor, it was not like a shooting star, it wasn't like a satellite going by since it was way too big.  I just couldn't tell what it was.;42.4903463414634;-82.8970121951219
