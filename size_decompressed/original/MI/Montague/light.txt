Bizzare orangle lights in night sky.;2012-08-18 22:30:00;10 minutes;Bizzare orangle lights in night sky. I saw three orange lights in the sky over lake Michigan performing maneuvers not possible by regular aircraft.  This is also not the first time I have seen them. I saw them in early july and then again about a week ago on Mackinac island. Each time my mom has been there to witness them with me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
