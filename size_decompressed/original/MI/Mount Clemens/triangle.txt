Triangular shaped light in the sky with a fourth orb following behind.;2013-11-04 19:00:00;10 minutes;triangular shaped light in the sky with a fourth orb following behind Driving home the other night my fiance and I looked up in the sky only to see a triangular shaped craftof some sort.  The table consisted of 3 separate bright orange/yellow lights spherical in shape.  There was also a fourth craft moving behind it.  This fourth craft appear to attach itself to the triangular shape and from there the bottomed right craft slowly peeled.off and the lights disappeared.  It didn't appear to be an airplane because there were no flashing lights indicating so.   We have also witnessed this occurance while driving near Armada, MI.  We he no explanation for what these lights could possibly be.  The lights either completely vanish only to leave the fourth orb of light by itself for approximately a minute and then that too vanishes, or they all completely disappear together.   On a side note, both my fiance and I are hunters.  And since seeing there lights we have not seen any wildlife. Including birds and squirrels.;42.5956;-82.8772
