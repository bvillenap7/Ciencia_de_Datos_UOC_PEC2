Orange orbs in triangle shape in night sky.   ((anonymous report));2017-04-22 23:00:00;2 minutes;Orange orbs in triangle shape in night sky Was on the back deck having a smoke, when I look up in the sky, I see orange orbs in the shape of a triangle  with two more sets of orbs at the large end triangle.  Kind of like a manta ray, just above the tree line.   I heard no noise coming from it, the sky was clear, and it just hovered there.   I went back inside and got my cell phone to take a picture.  When I had my cell phone up to take the picture, the lights shimmered and it was gone before I could take a picture.
