Large saucer shape with rotating red  lights..hovering slowly over treetops..no sound;1976-04-19 21:15:00;1-2 minutes;Large saucer shape with rotating red  lights..hovering slowly over treetops..no sound My friend had been walking and  watching this UFO float over the houses and trees slowly.  I ran out to the street and asked what he was doing?  He replied, watching that.  I was amazed at two things.  1)  My friend wasn't at all excited.  2)  How big this thing was moving slow with no noise.   We watched for a minute or so till we could no longer see it.  The UFO was only a  couple hundred feet away and just over the treetops and houses.  Looked like a red disc with red lights rotating.  I ran to get someone else but it was gone.   We called the police right away and then heard the police helicopter fly over the house very fast.   This sighting was documented in two articles by the Lansing State Journal where other eye witnesses, including patrolmen on the ground and the Lansing police helicopter unit, which followed it till it disappeared at a high rate of speed behind our State Capital.;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291

I was driving my vehicle up a ramp westbound when something caught my eye to the south-south-east.  It was too large to be a meteorite and though it moved slower than one it moved much faster than an airplane.  It then dropped below sight.  It was a white ball of light.;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291
I saw a UFO in the early morning.;2006-03-09 06:15:00;10 seconds;I saw a UFO in the early morning. I woke up to my dog whining to go outside at about 6:12 A.M. I let him out of my front door and I looked up and did a double take. I saw a disk-like shaped object flying in the sky. It had many light on the underside,about ten. Two of them were red and the other lights were white. The object was very metallic looking. I know it wasn't an airplane because it was too low to the ground and too large. Also none of the lights were blinking. I saw it flying to the south. I froze and stared at it as it dissapeared into the clouds. I am convinced that it was a UFO.;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291
Disk-shaped UFO with blinking red and white lights in the sky over Lansing, MI.;2020-04-16 21:11:00;1 hour;Disk-shaped UFO with blinking red and white lights in the sky over Lansing, MI. At first I thought it was just a plane, but then I realized there's no airport in the direction it was going toward it was flying toward the ground on the Southside of Lansing, MI. It had no wings and made no noise. It was shaped like a disk and had two white lights and one red light. It was moving at a very fast pace. I tried to take a picture but was unsuccessful because of how fast it was moving. About an hour later, the other witness and I both felt vibrations coming from our house. Our dog started barking at the door so I went to check outside again and the UFO was in the sky again heading towards Holt,MI. I tried to take a video but it wouldn't show up on my camera at all.;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291
