extremely high altitude, medium bright light emitting faint, glittery orange streaks in all directions;1970-07-11 20:30:00;30 minutes;extremely high altitude, medium bright light emitting faint, glittery orange streaks in all directions I’ve always been reluctant to outright accept the existence of extraterrestrial aerial craft, or UFOs.  Even after seeing something a little strange when I was a kid that I’ve never really been able to explain.   I think I was about 14 or 15 (it was a long time ago, maybe 1970 or 71).  It was mid-Summer in my home town, Lansing, Michigan, and my best friend and I were playing softball with some other kids at the neighborhood school ground.  When it started getting too dark for softball, we walked back to our street.  When we got to my house, the stars had just begun to come out.  I went in the house and grabbed a couple sodas and went back outside.   We both laid back on the grass of the front lawn next to the driveway, looking up into the sky.  At the same time, we both saw a stationary point of light that was a blue-green color.  It wasn’t overly bright, but it was larger than any star I had ever seen, so it was distinctly noticeable, yet it seemed to be way, way up there amongst all the other stars.  I would estimate (from memory) that a bee-bee held between the thumb and index finger at arm’s length would represent the visually perceived size of the object from the ground.  Anyhow, we watched it for maybe fifteen minutes.  During that time, it wasn’t doing much, other than pulsating slightly (twinkling).  Then, we started seeing faint orange glittery streaks of light shooting from it.   I remember saying something like, Woah!  Check that out! and my friend said, Yeah, man, I’m seein’ it too!  They were shooting out from the object in all directions, and each streak ended in a tiny white sparkle, except for some of them that seemed to be actually impacting smaller stars surrounding the object, as if it was shooting some sort of weapon at them.  To a couple of imaginative teenage boys, this was pretty exciting stuff.  But even then, I remember thinking, maybe it’s a satellite, or some other man-made spacecraft, and the streaks shooting from it are booster jets being used to man! euver the object or reposition its orbit.  If only I had a telescope.  The streaks were like fireworks right after they’re launched, when you can just make out a faint spark trail as they shoot through the sky before they explode.  In fact, the scene was kind of like a miniature version of the finale of a major fireworks display where they shoot off a whole mess of fireworks all at once.  This stellar battle lasted for another fifteen minutes or so, and then the thing simply blinked out.  Just like that.  It was gone.  We told everybody we knew about what we had seen, and I’m not sure who believed us and who didn’t.  Like I said at the beginning of this accounting, I’m a little skeptical about things like this.  I’ve always figured that what we saw probably has some perfectly normal, down-to-earth explanation. (Not that I have any clue what that might be.) (???)  Anybody else ever seen anything similar?

Black cloud like objects with one or more white lights moving within and between the black areas.;2010-07-28 23:00:00;10 minutes +;Black cloud like objects with one or more white lights moving within and between the black areas. These sightings actually began about six weeks ago.  I have observed what would appear to be black clouds moving at will across the sky.  Some will contain lights which move within the clouds and in the last couple of days, the lights have actually been moving from cloud to cloud.   Last week for the first time, the lights were orginally white within the black area, but then in one particular cloud, they started flashing red.   Again, tonight I witnessed the lights, several in one black cloud, change from white to red.  Not all of them changed colors.   These clouds are located in the southern sky from my vantage point and will move both horizontally and vertically at will.  There does not seem to be any particular pattern to them.   I have seen them almost every night and have tried to figure out if there was a pattern that could be explained, but it just does not seem possible that someone on the ground could be creating this activity since sometimes, several of the black lit clouds are moving in different directions at the same time, again with no pattern.;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291
Three people in a car saw two lights moving at will and vary in brightness then fly away very fast.;2010-08-26 20:40:00;3:00;Three people in a car saw two lights moving at will and vary in brightness then fly away very fast. This sighting took place in Lansing, MI on August 26th,  2010. There were three of us in a car heading west on Saginaw Hwy. Person 1 is sitting in the passenger seat, person 2 is driving, and person 3 is sitting in the middle back seat. It was around 8:40PM, the Sun  was just under the horizon almost centered with the road no stars were visible yet. Person 1 noticed a light that was approx. 60-80 degrees vertical, and 100-120 degrees horizontal (90 degrees being centered with the road) which was really high in the sky and could be easily confused as a Star/Planet. At first it was thought to be Mars because of the reddish orange tint. Person 1 announced that there was a light in the sky when he noticed it was to close to be a star/planet, the other two started looking for it. Person 2 located the light, then the two noticed that the light was moving slowly flying in different directions at will and slowing down and resuming speed.  They also witnessed it dim ! until not visible, then fade back in, then faded back out.  Person 3 noticed the light fade back in while simultaneously the other two noticed another light higher and brighter than the original and getting brighter, thinking it was the original. At this point the three thought they were looking at the same light, person 1 and 2 kept saying, “ It’s getting brighter!”  Person 3 noticed that he was looking at a different light because the one he was looking at was getting dimmer then disappeared then reappeared then he noticed they were looking higher up in the sky and had to lean forward to see the other light which was really bright. Then person 3 yelled, “oh! There’s two of them!” Person 1 noticed the original light, it took person 2 a little longer to find it because he was driving. We watched the lights move around, and vary in brightness then the brighter 2nd light started to head south, the other light soon followed they accelerated way  faster than we had seen them trav! el previously, and as they flew they faded out. The 1st dimmer! light w as out of sight first. We were unsure if the lights were produced from inside or reflections of the sun. This all happened within a few minutes. We kept looking in the sky for the lights but never saw them.;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291
Orange orbs over downtown Lansing - Dec. 6 2011;2011-12-06 19:00:00;2-3 minutes;Orange orbs over downtown Lansing - Dec. 6 2011 I was driving north on Cedar Street, from Mt. Hope Ave to Interstate 496.  Heading due north, I saw a group of floating orange orbs.  It was the night prior to Pearl Harbor so my first thought was this was some kind of memorial with sky lanterns, except that the orbs seemed to be somewhat brighter than what would be generated by a sky lantern at night. I turned onto eastbound Interstate 496 and did not see any more of the orbs. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291

Fleet of orange lights crosses the night sky;2012-06-08 23:30:00;2 minutes;Fleet of orange lights crosses the night sky I was driving east down a main road when I looked to the north and saw a strangely colored (what I thought) was a star.  It had an orange glow and was the brightest object in the sky.  It seemed stationary, and so I was very perplexed at this object.   I turned onto the next side street, and immediately realized the object was moving east.  I exited my vehicle and watched as it crossed the sky when suddenly two more lights just like it entered my plane of view.  They were moving at similar speeds and in the same direction.  These lights were followed by more a set of three, one more behind it.  If these were crafts, this was a fleet. I took a video of the sighting on my phone, but the quality is very poor (watch at  http://youtu.be/DjsEt_M3S90).  Each object only appears as a speck of white light, and not the intense orange glow they actually had.   In total I would say there was anywhere between 10-20 objects crossing my line of sight over a couple minutes.

Bright light, intense heat noise over Lansing, MI.;2015-03-20 04:00:00;2 minutes;Bright light, intense heat noise over Lansing MI At approximately 0400 03/20/15, I felt my house shake.  At first I thought we were having an earthquake.   Following the shaking, sounds similar to video games appeared and this in turn was subsequently followed by a white, bright light and intense heat.  The light went through my bedroom window (which has super thick curtains in it) and I felt like it was burning me, similar to how one would feel when sunburned.  This sensation lasted maybe 3 minutes after whatever flew by my window had passed.   I also felt like g-forces were being pulled down on me as it went overhead.;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291

Then shortly thereafter, I heard what sounded like video game noises and this huge bright light shown through my bedroom window (despite there being dark curtains).   After the bright light, there was this intense heat emitted and I literally felt like I was being burned.   The entire episode lasted maybe 2 minutes, at the most, but it was the strangest thing.;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291
Two whitish, yellow lights were following each other with no noise.;2015-05-05 10:45:00;1 minute;Two whitish, yellow lights were following each other with no noise. Two ufos were following each other heading from the west to the east.  They were whitish yellow lights, the shape could not be determined but the lights were somewhat circular.  The first UFO was leading, moving left to right with the second one following (not perfectly) what the first one was doing.   They were probably about 2,000-4,000 feet high (definitely lower than the clouds, which were altocumulus clouds, I think and lower than planes).  There was no noise.   At first I thought it was two birds following each other with the sun reflecting off of them but it was too late for the sun to be a factor and they were traveling way too fast.  Also, it was too late for birds.  At the time I was in my back yard with a clear view of the sky. Weird.;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291
