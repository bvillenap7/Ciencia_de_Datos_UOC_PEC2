Bright orange, teardrop-shaped objects at low altitude moving in a straight line.;2007-07-04 22:30:00;1 minute;Bright orange, teardrop-shaped objects at low altitude moving in a straight line. We saw bright orange (like flame, not lights) teardrop-shaped objects moving roughly east in a straight line. On this evening we saw two of them approximately five minutes apart. The evening was still, but we could hear no noise coming from them. They resembled hot air balloons on fire except they were traveling much too fast, at about the speed and altitude of a private plane. Also, the intensity of the light did not diminish as though something was actually on fire in the sky. They were far too slow to be meteorites. Fireworks were going on about two miles west, or perhaps just finishing. These objects looked too large to be flaming debris.  Five days prior several of us saw three of these objects over about an hour's time. Sky/weather conditions and description were as above, except no fireworks were going on.;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291

Another man pulled up in his truck in middle of drive sat on his tailgate.  Then a Bright White streak kinda resembled a shooting star with a tear drop at front of White streak all connected inside the teardrop was a burgundy light and the the other half was white light and also the streak was bright white . It was strange because it was headed west eye lever from dock like paralell.  I couldn't believe my eyes and yelled did you see that?  Of course he said he did and he made a wish.  I have seen several strange things in the night sky this year..  This one was the best so far.;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291
