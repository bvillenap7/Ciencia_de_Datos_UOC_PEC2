Red orbs over Lansing Michigan;2007-09-01 21:40:00;3 Minutes;Red orbs over Lansing Michigan Approximately 9:40pm on Saturday, August 1, 2007, I was traveling northbound on Aurelius Road in the vicinity of 84 Lumber when I spotted a round, red light to the east above Cottonwoods Campground.  I pulled into the 7-11 on the corner of  Aurelius & Jolly, got out of my car, and called to the attendant and customer in 7-11 to come outside and look at the sky. What I saw were 3 round, red objects about 50 feet apart traveling silently to the north in the area bordering Jolly Road to the south, Aurelius Road to the west and Dunckel Road to the east. The objects seemed to keep the same spacing between them, traveled in silence, and were not just merely floating. I would estimate their speed at 20-30 mph. The only description I can think of would be that they looked like red, Chinese globes that one might see in a Chinese restaurant or Chinese ornaments. There was the appearance of flickering light at the bottom of each object that I thought could have been a flame. As we watched, the flickering in the southernmost object disappeared, leaving only two objects that I could see. Those two objects continued north toward Lansing and disappeared from view.;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291
Seven or eight red orange lights moving slowly making no sound.  ((NUFORC Note:  Other reports of this event are pending.  PD));2011-10-24 22:30:00;30sec. - 1 min;Seven or eight red orange lights moving slowly making no sound. First off I would like to say that I am colorblind, so Iâ€™m not so sure about the color but I would have to say that they where an orangeish-red. Anyway, I am an overnight janitor that works all over Lansing throughout the night going from account to account. At about 10:20 pm I had pulled up to an account  roughly on the corner of Fairview and Grand River. I had backed my truck up so that I was facing north as I always do when  I received a phone call from my boss.	 	 The conversation went on for about ten minutes (about 10:30pm now) I noticed the first object out of the corner of my eye. It was an aspirin-sized reddish light that was moving quite slow coming from the north-west just over the top view on the two storied building to my left moving vary steadily to the east. After about five seconds two or three exact same size and shape objects faded into view just in front of the first one, followed by another small grouping. All moving at the EXACT same speed and never breaking there formation witch was nothing really impressive. At this time I interrupted my boss and was begging him to go outside and look to the north. He was at a location just southeast about a quarter mile from my location. The objects, seven or eight total, never making a noise started to fade out one by one after traveling half way across the sky. By the time that the last one made it to the far right (north-east) of me, my boss finally made it outside and at least confirmed the sighting of the last one left. He confirmed the location and the color, but said that it was flickering before it diapered, and overall was not impressed. I on the other hand saw the whole thing and can say that not one of the objects ever blinked or flickered even once. The whole incident lasted somewhere between thirty and sixty seconds, and the objects moved slow and very steady. In fact I can remember thinking that they may be helicopters, But once again, no sound at all, no blinking lights, and why would they fade in and out?  I have very little knowledge of aircraft, spatial differences, speeds and heights of normal objects in the sky , But I can safely say that They where NOT Meteors. They did not move nearly fast enough or leave tracers or tails. I have seen my share of them. I also know that the direction that the objects came from was in the area of the Lansing international airport. So hopefully that will help in finding some answers. I also drew a picture of the formation shortly after seeing the event, but I can't upload it because I don't have a scanner.;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291
Flying formation of flashing aircrafts.;2016-10-23 21:00:00;2 minutes;Flying formation of flashing aircrafts. Sitting outside last night and looked in the sky and seen 3 objects that looked like upside down V's.  They had a reddish orange glow and flew in formation with one leading.   After a few seconds of trying to figure out what they were they disappeared.  Just like that they were gone then another set appeared.  These ones flew slowly across the sky then started blinking.  I'm not sure what I saw but I do know I have never seen anything like it before.;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291
