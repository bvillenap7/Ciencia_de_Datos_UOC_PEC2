Observed hundreds of clear orbs in the sky appearing to be looking at me.;1995-04-30 23:30:00;15 minutes;Observed hundreds of clear orbs in the sky appearing to be looking at me. I am 38 years old now and have been troubled for years over what I experienced at the age of 19.  My boyfriend and I parked at a rest area off at I-75 in Lansing, Michigan.  We stopped there to make out, talk, etc.   After being there for about 5 minutes, we suddenly noticed hundreds of iridescent free flying circular clear orbs that came closer and closer to our car.  They seemed to be observing us.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  They came as close as only 10 to 20 feet away from the car.  At that time, I became very afraid and we left the rest area.  As we drove off, we could see them flying back up into the sky as we got back on I-75.   This has been driving me crazy for years now, as I am a very logical and scientific person.  I haven't told very many people of this event because I know most people won't believe me, but still after all these years I think about it at least once a week.  I am glad to finally share my extremely bizarre event that ha! ppened to me.   To this day, I can't find anything on the internet that can relate to my happenings.  Over the years, I have wondered if this could have been a paranormal event rather than an alien experience.  If anyone out there had this happen, please let me know.  I feel so alone with this and will take it to my grave wondering.  I just want to know what this was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Seen something that was not a helicopter or a plane , too low, too silent, no sound, the damn thing hovered.  Planes don't do that.;1999-10-13 22:00:00;10 minutes;Seen something that was not a helicopter or a plane , too low, too silent, no sound, the damn thing hovered.  Planes don't do that. Coming home in a west direction seen like headlights flickering back and forth, turned into apt. complex followed going east and then lost it for a second seen it again hovering above entrance to the apt. complex, somehow it went from east to west in a matter of seconds, hovered for 30 seconds.  Then took off and went southwest very quickly, mind you ther is no sound at all, seemed to disappear in to like a fog because the clouds lit up for a split second and it was gone.  red lights white lights and a square light.  very bizarre.;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291

Sighting North East of Lansing! 9:05 (sic.  p.m.)  Step out side to take off to the store,  I had looked up at the sky scratched my head. Stumped, as I could not identify port and starboard indicators.  These 17 objects appeared from these SouthEast headed Northwest.  Not in proper flying uniform as you'd see military helicopters and or jets.  Unusually low flying.  These objects are all in same shape color, these objects were flying in a set destination headed some where unkown;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291

Starting recording at 9:51pm.  Saw a white circular object moving fast across the sky.  Looked like it was going in a straight line.  Did not see any blinking lights. Have eleven seconds video.  Thinking it might be from the Launch today, but have no idea.  Thank you;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291
