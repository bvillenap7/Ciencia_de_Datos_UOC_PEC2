Something burning up in the morning sky?;2000-10-20 07:50:00;5 minutes;Something burning up in the morning sky? I was walking to work in the morning. I walk about 6 blocks east.  I am looking into the sun as it is rising, very orange and pleasant to look at.  In the sky about 40 degrees or so above the horizon I see an contrail.  It caught my interest because of all the chemtrails, but this was very high, like a real contrail.  I thought it was a jet out of selfride air national guard base most likely.  The contrail wasnt very long, but the object glowed orange like the sun.  I figured the jet was shiney and reflecting the rising sun, but then it disappeared along witht he contrail.  I then noticed a second contrail like the first but south a bit from the first.  It was doing the same thing, then glowed the same and disappeared.  This was likely something entering the atmosphere, like meteorites or perhaps it was a couple jets.  It seemed odd for them to just disappear along with the contrail, and the contrail seemed short if it was a meteorite burning up.  I thought I would post this and see if anyone else saw it or knows what it was.	 ((NUFORC Note:  Report seems to us to be reminiscent of normal contrail activity.

4 bright lights and 2 blinking red, dead silent and flying west VERY low very close to Lake Lansing from Wood St.;2008-06-10 02:30:00;10 seconds;4 bright lights and 2 blinking red, dead silent and flying west VERY low very close to Lake Lansing from Wood St. This was hidden by a hill that is 40 feet at its highest point, that is when I lost sight of it. I did not get a chance to see its shape, just the four big bright white lights.  Again, this made NO SOUND AT ALL.  I did not get to see the shape of it.  I was looking North, object traveling West. Entirely too low to make the airport if it was hidden by a hill of that size.;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291
I do not have a lot of information because I was in a hurry, but I saw a blackish cloud really high in the sky in downtown Lansing. At;2011-11-28 13:55:00;Unknown;I do not have a lot of information because I was in a hurry, but I saw a blackish cloud really high in the sky in downtown Lansing.  At first I thought it was a helicopter dumping something in the air, but as I stopped for a second to look, it wasn't moving.  The black cloud-like shape remained there. Unable to stop much longer I kept moving and looking back.  As I drove out of the parking ramp and looked back to see if it was still there, it had disappeared.

I seen it just under the big dipper.  The U.F.O was like, don't know how to explain it, other then it was bright for like 3 seconds, then you couldn't see it any more, until it lit up again.  It did this across the sky for a long time.  I had to go into the house so that's all i seen it do!!!  I know that this is not normal to an every day plain or any thing I've ever seen.  Personally, I'm scared!!!;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291
Two low-flying/hovering crafts.  Hovering at low altitude as we approached.  Took off flying. ((anonymous report));2016-10-29 00:00:00;22:30;Two low flying/ hovering crafts.  Hovering at low altitude as we aproached.  Took off flying as we drive under them. One continued east, while the other hovered right above US 127 S. as we drove over the Clark Rd. overpass. Drove pursuing the other end that headed East, we turned south on Chandler Rd., and again saw it hovering.  Again, as we aproached, it took off.  This time headed West.   These were not drones.  They were large and low. Flashed similar to what a plane would, with the exception of one very bright, yellow colored light that turned on and off intermittently.

On April 9th at 7:05 AM I left from my home in Grand Ledge for work In Lansing, MI, by the Lansing Capitol Airport.;2019-04-09 07:10:00;10 minutes;On April 9th, at 7:05 AM I left from my home in Grand Ledge for work In Lansing, MI, by the Lansing Capitol Airport.  Driving East on M-43 past M-100, past Nixon Road, and at just past Upton Road I noticed an odd rectangular shaped cloud at 10 to 11 oâ€™clock.  The cloud stood out because the rest of the clouds heading East where at the horizon and they all had a gray to purple color, time about 7:10AM.  The clouds did not block the sun since it was rising in the East. I thought the cloud was an airliner getting ready to land at the Lansing Capitol Airport because I thought the sun light was reflecting off the plane.  As I continued to the stop light at N. Market Place Blvd, I decided that it was not a plane, but I thought how odd this cloud was, rectangular shaped but the edges and corners were not sharp rather cloud like and white in color.  There was quite a contrast between the rectangular cloud and the clouds around the horizon.  The sky above the horizon was clear except for the white rectangular cloud.  The time was 7:16AM. I drove on and got on 96 West and did not notice the rectangular cloud at all.  I exited on Grand River Avenue heading East to where I work near the airport.  I drove past the Marathon pumping station and noticed the rectangular cloud again.  As I looked at while driving, I noticed that the cloud evaporated from the inside out.  I thought this was a very odd phenomenon.  I have never seen a cloud evaporate from the inside out before in my life.  The time was 7:20AM. No other airplanes were in the air.  Is this a normal aerial phenomenon?;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291

Aprox 2:45am, bright light materialized in sky and with immense speed shot in what looked to be a south western direction before disappearing into another flash(almost like a bubble around the light mass, opened then closed), distance looked to be upper atmospheric or further.;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291
