We were cresting a hill when I saw a strange bright orange/yellow glittering ball of light overhead just above the pine trees, high in the sky.  It was very bright, as bright as a planet I would say.  Certainly not as bright as an airplane might be.  The strange light moved away at a steady slow rate and we lost it.  We walked for minute more and then suddenly we saw it again!   It was coming back in the opposite direction!  We were so stunned by this we stopped to look at it and we definitely though this light was odd. It was glittering, bright orange and sometimes reddish in tint.  We just stood there and watched it move silently, and slowly.  It's flight was somewhat wobbly, even though it moved in a straight trajectory.  After about a minute it became very dim, only a pinprick of light and then it vanished completely.  Whatever it was, my sister was overjoyed she'd seen a ufo but I on the other hand was pretty shaken up.  I've never seen anything like that before!;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291
