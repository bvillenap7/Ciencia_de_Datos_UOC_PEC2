object had sections like a large tootsie roll only more squared, no lights or noise,lit by city lights moved smoothly in straight line ;1980-11-10 20:00:00;15 secs;object had sections like a large tootsie roll only more squared, no lights or noise,lit by city lights moved smoothly in straight line overhead.got a good look but could'nt explain what made it fly.I.m normal blue collar family man I like to look at the sky, I see things ,this is one . I was in the southern to middle part of town  waiting outside of a friends house for my wife as we were leaving  and just looking at the sky when I notice a dark object lit by the city lights float by for about 15 seconds before it disappeared in  the dark. I t was retangular and had distinct sections best described as the sections of a large tootsie roll or less like but similar to a train. It had no wings or lights. It silenty and smoothly when by almost overhead west of where I was. I would estimate the size by the amount of light to the duration to be larger than a train  box car. I'm no whacko and i saw it clearly & am happy to finnally have a chance to report it, thank you.;42.7221806547621;-84.5725973214291
long object over Lansing, MI;2003-07-31 13:20:00;15 seconds;long object over Lansing, MI traveling eastbound on Saginaw , I was west of downtown Lansing about 1.5 miles or so.  I saw something traveling southbound over the trees and I would estimate that it was just east of downtown lansing.  I looked very long and short like a rectangle but could have been any shape as I was viewing it from the side.  Lansing has an airport here and I see small and large commercial planes but this had no features like they do, just rectangular with a sort of structure to it, like a triangular framework like steel beams or something. It looked like it was on a downward angle but going away from the airport and it traveled very flat and quickly for its size.  The 747's that I see seem to float along and this was moving probably 4 or 5 times faster than that.  It appeared closer to the ground than commercial aircraft too.  I was driving my car and couldnt get much more than that, I didnt want to cause an accident.  It disappeared behind the treeline and the GM plant there.  Perhaps I could go there and take a picture and then illustrate where it was in the sky and how long it was. I guess thats about it for what I can say about it. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness at some length, and we found him to be quite eloquent, sincere, and seemingly quite credible.  We would welcome reports from other witnesses.
