As my roomate and I were sitting outside smoking on the fron porch which faces south, our dog sasha, a dashound, started barking and looking to the south east.   As I looked to see what she was barking at I seen a disk floating above the martin drag way race track.  It was several hundred feet in the air making it visible above the trees that are in our line of site to the race track.  It made no noise and had colored lights going around it.   Then it simply vanished, making no sound at all.;42.5342;-85.6456
