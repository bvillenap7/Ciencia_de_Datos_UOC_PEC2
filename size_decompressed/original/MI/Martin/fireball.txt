Got up to use my bathroom and looked out my window as I used bathroom, and I seen to the north a large orange sphere floating across the sky from west to east. It had no blinking lights and was large and was about a few miles away and a mile high.  I would say it was the size of a house.  It made no noise as I opened my window to listen.;42.5342;-85.6456
