grey oval in the sky in the daytime in Michigan;2003-11-01 11:04:00;15 seconds;grey oval in the sky in the daytime in Michigan I was traveling west bound on Interstate 96 just west of Grand Rapids Michigan. It was a very cloudy day. I saw this medium grey object through my windshield. It was moving right to left (north to south) and It looked like something descending through the clouds. As I watched it move across my windshield I was waiting for it to break out of the clouds but it never did. I believe it was traveling away from me and not descending. It moved very fast from right to left and then it made a sharp turn to the right and then back to the left agiain then disappeared behind some trees on the horizon. It seemed to kind of change axis when it made its turns. I would estimate it was probably 3 miles or so away when I lost sight of it. It was medium grey or a dark silver color and was about a half an inch long as it appeared through my windshield. At the speed it was traveling, and the abrupt zig-zag pattern it took, there is no way this could have been any kind of airplane. It was skimming through the clouds and did'nt appear to be very high up in them. This was my first UFO sighting.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
I watched it in clear view and it suddenly dissapeared.;2005-10-04 21:40:00;10 seconds;At 9:40 PM I was walking the dog on a clear warm night.   I noticed almost straight up towards the north a white oval shape as bright as the North Star but the size of Mars moving from south to north.  It was moving about as fast as a single engine plane away from me and seemed to be at a high altitude. There was no sound. ] I watched it in clear view and it suddenly dissapeared.  There were no blinking tail or wing lights, and since it was moving away from I know the brightness of the light was not any kind of head wing lights.  I watched cover about 15% of the sky.  The sighting lasted about a total of 10 seconds.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Light - Oval;2011-09-21 23:30:00;< 2 sec's;Light - Oval Around 11:30 PM last night I was gazing out the south facing window. All of a sudden, something (a UFO) flew West to East at great speed, in my summation I'd say over 500 MPH. I have very large double Windows.  At least 3 feet wide, maybe a little larger. I have seen planes and Aero-Med fly by the window before, when they do I can track them for several seconds as they pass by. Also I can hear them. This thing traversed the span of my window in less than 2 seconds. There was a Blue Light on the top a Red one below and there was a diminished White light in the middle (in a sort of Oval shape). It made absolutely NO SOUND. I got up to look out the window to see if I could make out where it was going and it was gone.  No, it didn't fly over the house or anywhere in the direction of the hospital, it was on a straight line East like toward ADA. And, again, It Made No Sound.

A beautiful night, clear skies and a wonderful light show.  I hope to see more in the future;2013-08-17 22:08:00;12 minutes;A beautiful night, clear skies and a wonderful light show.  I hope to see more in the future I was at work Friday night and I happened to see a red orb in the sky, it stayed in one spot for 30 sec it blinked out for 1 sec, then appeared in a spot (a little to the east).   It stayed in the spot for 30 sec then went to another spot.   5 min later I noticed 3 red orbs in a diagonal row, it looked like orions belt.  Within 2 min the orbs were gone. The place where they appeared are over an airport (the Gerald R. Ford airport). The orbs were red in color and they appeared to blink out then appear in other spots within seconds.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Five to seven yellow/orange round objects appearing to hover in the sky.;2014-05-22 05:20:00;15 minutes;Five to seven yellow/orange round objects appearing to hover in the sky. At approximately the elevation a helicopter or small aircraft would travel, I observed five to seven smallish orange/yellow round objects appearing to hover west of the location I was in.  I was riding a bike doing laps so I observed these objects numerous times as I would come around again.   These objects did not flash or appear to be moving however on two occasions (laps) I observed one of the objects move towards another in the group then back to its starting location.   After approximately 15 minutes I observed them appearing to move towards the west as they grew fainter and before I made the curve in my lap I could see they were gone.  I continued for another 30 minutes and they did not appear again. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
White smoke leaving a flying object, in which the object then disappears.;2014-07-16 21:00:00;7 minutes;White smoke leaving a flying object, in which the object then disappears. It is July 16, 2014, 9:25 pm, the reason I know what time it was because my father and law stated to my sister in-laws that he timed them out of the yard chore that had been done at 9:25 pm July 16, 2014. During this initial conversation, I looked up into the sky saw a plane coming from the south and the plane was clear enough for me to have stated sitting in front of the wing and the rear of the wing a few times in my life.   While looking up at the air plane, reminiscing about old times, I noticed a oval shaped faintly lit orange object in the sky heading west moving about the same speed as the airplane I spoke of earlier.  I watched this object about the size of a head of a 5/32 drill bit down to a 1/8 drill bit, then all of sudden I seen about 3/4 of an inch of white smoke behind the 1/8 inch drill bit size object disappeared.  (Shapes and sizes are my point of view of the flying object from where I was standing in Grand Rapids, Michigan, while looking up into a clear blue sky the plane was about an 1 inch long in the sky. )  Keep in mind the plane was heading northeast, and the object was heading west.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Egg-shaped light shot from clouds to ground.;2018-02-28 20:00:00;Instant;Egg shaped light shot from clouds to ground. I saw a large oval or egg shape that streaked from the clouds toward the ground.  It was very fast.  The oval was very bright white and had an orange halo around it.  I wouldn't have seen it if I hadn't been looking in that direction.  There was no sound.
