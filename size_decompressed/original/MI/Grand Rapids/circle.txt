Two on each side and one from both ends! After a few more seconds it turned from being a bright light with beams to a solid red color and grew small very fast and then it was gone. I have never been a big believer in UFO's but this was something really odd to us (enough for me to report it)I am a male 52 years old.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Uniform circular pattern of lights moving very fast across the sky several thousand feet high.;2009-08-02 22:00:00;2 seconds;Uniform circular pattern of lights moving very fast across the sky several thousand feet high. My son and I were camping in the back yard in a tent. It was after dusk but not very dark yet. I saw a pattern of lights move across the sky from high up left to a downward direction to the lower right. The object was a circular pattern of about 5 bright yellow lights with one light in the center. It was not very high in the sky, about 2,000 feet. It was about the size of a dime from 20 feet away. It moved very fast. It may have changed direction but I am not certain. I first thought it was a shooting star but the uniform pattern of lights is not consistent with that.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174

ISS type object traveling west to east apexing at 90 degrees. Brighter and faster than the ISS sightings I have seen before.;2017-06-25 22:50:00;2 minutes;ISS type object traveling west to east apexing at 90 degrees.  Brighter and faster than the ISS sightings I have seen before. I was outside having a cigarette and watching the skies as I always do.  I noticed a fast moving craft in the western sky moving towards me and it went directly over my head, pretty much 90 degrees,toward the east.  It came and went in about 2 mins.  Although traveling what I thought was faster than the ISS, I initially thought it to be the ISS.   I then went inside to check ISS and other satellite fly-bys, and could not find any scheduled until a Chinese satellite at 23:00.  What I saw was very bright and very fast.  On first sight I called my wife out to see it.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174

Red Circular Object Seen over Grand Rapids.;2019-09-07 05:45:00;2 minutes;Red Circular Object Seen over Grand Rapids. I was walking my dog this morning (heading northbound on Fairview Avenue).  We stopped in front of Lookout Park in order for my dog to((walk)) when I happened to look up into the sky and notice a bright red circle come into view from the west, heading east. It was approximately pea-sized at arms length and was traveling slowly.  And as it neared the midway point of my view, a bright flash of white light occurred just above it.  (Strangely, the flash of light was slow as well.  It wasn't like turning on and off a light and took a good two seconds to finish.)  After the flash of light, the red circular object proceeded on its way to the east and disappeared out of view.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
