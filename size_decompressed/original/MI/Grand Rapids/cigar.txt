((CORRESPONDENCE FROM WITNESS)) peter, i ment to say the cigar shaped object was at 2:30 in the morning.so no it was not an aeroplane because the whole thing was lit up from the inside out.no contrails because it was dark,however the tail end of the craft looked like a crushed  and somewhat tappered end.the nose was bigger at the top leading end ,like an uneven nose of a craft,like an upside down jets nose.it was glowing like yellow amber on fire.moving terribly slow.not as a blimp shape,like two frisbees put together to resemble a saucer.somewhat cigar shaped.it left no trail at all.iv'e never seen anything ever like it,im 31 yrs. old.most interesting to me is the triangle sets of lights i told you about twice.seen by me northwest of int 96 and us 131 in grand rapids,that was it for me.it flew right over head,low,quiet,strange and awe inspiring indeed.my friend and his wife saw a ufo change colors,fly off at sharp angles and such around 1995 in kent county,five miles south of sparta near the kent/ottowa countie lines.his wife cried and said to get on the quadrunner and get the heck out of there and never breathe a word!but we believe!thank you peter.please respond back if you will.i heard about you on coast,keep at it!!

I was at a traffic light waiting for it to change when I saw a white cigar shaped craft high above the clouds heading in an easterly direction.  I expressly looked for any type of wings to determine if it was a plane, but there wasn't any.  I drove my vehicle over to the nearest gas station and got out.  The object I observed was now heading south and vanished behind some cloud cover.  There were no trails of smoke or sound from the craft.  I was really suprised nobody else saw this.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174

It seemed to move very slowly and left no smoke trail behind it.  I also seemed to be moving sideways.  Then it suddenly picked up speed and disappeared in a flash.  I have never seen anything like this before and I have no background having anything to do with UFOs.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
