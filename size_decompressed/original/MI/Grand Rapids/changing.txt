Seen a color changing, light fading ball and then transformed into a cigar then back to a ball. it was hovering above the area of st.mary's hospital.  My girlfriend was the first to witness the ufo thinking it was a star.  Until we started seeing it move in every direction. There's no way a plane wouldve stayed in our sight that long.  There's no way a helicopter would have hovered that long or probably be allowed to over the hospital air space.  It was not a drone because it had very bright color changing lights.  It was not ball lightning because at most that lasts less than 30 seconds, and this went on for 45 minutes.  At some points, we thought we seen some lights fly off of it.
