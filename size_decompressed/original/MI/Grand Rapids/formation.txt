I saw a double V formation of faint green triangular craft.;1999-03-12 21:00:00;30 seconds;I saw a double V formation of faint green triangular craft. This event happened over three years ago. I recall all the details of the event except the exact date it occured. I was sitting on my porch looking south when I noticed a formation of about 40-50 marks flying in a double V formation. In other words, it looked like a flying(W). The objects were triangular and emmited a faint green hue. Several objects broke formation and moved north for a split second then returned. This was not a flock of birds due to the rate of return of the seperated objects. The entire formation was headed west at about 5000+mph est. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
