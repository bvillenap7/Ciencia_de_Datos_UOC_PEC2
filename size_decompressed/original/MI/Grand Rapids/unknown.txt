3 objects one flared up. GR MI;2009-05-02 22:00:00;30-40 minutes;3 objects one flared up. GR MI Myself, my girlfriend, sister in law, and her friend, were standing in our back yard chattin. I was lookin skyward wen i saw a object comparable with the stars. It was headin N-NE. Since it moved so fast i said look at that, everyon looked and found the object, we chatted bout satellites for a few seconds, when the whole thing flared up. It was so bright that it looked like it grew bout ten sizes larger for 3-5 seconds, then it went back to the normal tone. It never varied its heading this whole time. We could see it for prolly another three to four minutes before it covered the other half of our horizon an went outve view. As you could expect everyone was excited an watching the sky. Prolly 5 minutes later someone pointed out two more objects flyin close together from the east. We watched one object turn from headin NW (mostly west) along with the other an switch to N-NE. It seemed to follow the first object we seen, there direction mostly N by a lil NE. They both followed the restve of there headings true  till they crossed the horizons an disapeared. One that switched seemed to increase speed an dissapeared a few minutes faster then the one headed NW. Both outve site in round 5 minutes.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Quick Flash of Light in the Sky.;2014-08-14 20:00:00;1 second;Quick Flash of Light in the Sky. At 19:30 to 20:00, my partner and I went outdoors to smoke.  After the session, at about 20:00, we began to marvel at the stars' beauty that night, and lay back on the driveway to enjoy the night sky.  Near Orion's belt, for no more than a second, we both see a flash of white/blue light similar to a camera flash.   We observe for 10 more minutes as to find any more, and see 2 yellow/orange lights (non blinking) accompanied by a red light at the center.   At first we believe it to be a plane, but can not confirm due to a lack of noise and the apparent low altitude.  After this we go inside.   No pictures were taken due to the quickness of the event.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174

The lights appeared to be on the same horizontal line and flew directly above my house in a west to east direction disappearing into the clouds. The sighting of the lights occurred at 12.48am Sunday morning.   I can't seen to get my computer to accept military time notation.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Unusual craft flying and wobbling fast, and a big red trapezoid-like light.;2015-01-07 19:15:00;13-20 seconds;Unusual craft flying and wobbling fast, and a big red trapezoid-like light. I was taking my dog outside to go to the bathroom, and was watching the night sky.   Seconds after I looked up, I saw this large craft hovering across the sky very quickly.  It wobbled slightly, and had red and white lights.  One of the red ones was large and had a sort of trapezoid shape.   Within seconds, the craft traveled from the east side of the sky to the west, and lowered itself very quicky.   Because there were homes and trees in the way, it vanished from my sight.  Seconds later, a plane flew over.   I do not know if the plane had anything thing to do with the ufo.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Orange ball of light -- possibly triangle shaped -- high in altitude, changes course, two witnesses.;2016-10-22 12:46:00;5 minutes +;Orange ball of light -- possibly triangle shaped -- high in altitude, changes course, two witnesses. At my residence, I noticed an orang-ish -- what appeared to be triangle shaped, but couldn't tell for certain because of how high it was -- ball of light track at very high altitude, it was above an airliner (looking up the flight history, I believe it was ETD150, 777 from Chicago to Abu Dhabi).  This organ-ish ball was tracking north to south at a moderate clip -- there was no con-trail observed.  When I went to grab a witness the anomalous object was overhead, still tracking north to south.  Several minutes later, with the witness in hand, we observed that the object was now way off to the east and was tracking to the southwest.   It made quite a course correction in a short amount of time!   Eventually the object got too far out of range for us to see.  Neither the witness, nor myself have seen anything like it before.  It could not have been a satellite because of the course change -- maybe it was a weather balloon.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Very strange slow motion mechanic noise that lasted about 30 seconds.;2017-06-26 22:20:00;30 seconds;Very strange slow motion mechanic noise that lasted about 30 seconds. Did not see anything but heard a super creepy mechanic noise/echo for about 30 seconds, before it faded away.  We have the windows open, could hear the noise over the TV.  We turned off the TV and listened to it before it faded away.  Did NOT sound like a plane or helicopter.  Very slow motion mechanic sound.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
