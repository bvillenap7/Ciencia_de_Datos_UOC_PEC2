Dark, Black Triangle Craft;1978-07-10 21:00:00;5 Minutes;Dark, Black Triangle Craft It was a clear night, a friend and I were standing in my backyard when I looked up into the sky and saw a large floating dark triangle moving slowly across the sky from west to east.  Object made no sound and no lights were present.  We could make out the shape as it blotted out the stars behind it.  We both just stood there and watched in disbelief as it floated off and was obscured by trees.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Triangle Flotation;1995-04-28 09:30:00;5 mns;Triangle Floatation While standing on the corner of Market and Goodrich waiting for the bus, I began looking around in all directions.  Looking towards the downtown area, in the Northeast sky, I saw an object the had a triangle shape border with an amber light in the lower right corner. The body was transparent.   It slowly drifted eastward in the sky a little more than the pace of a hot air balloon.  It then stopped and began turning counter-clockwise and then disappeared.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174

In the middle of some highway, there was just some big craft hovering us real slowly out of nowhere, it was no airplane.;1999-04-10 20:00:00;30 minutes;In the middle of some highway, there was just some big craft hovering us real slowly out of nowhere, it was no airplane. My second sighting was in 1999 when my dad was visiting me at Grand Rapids for spring break.   We rented a hotel at the courtyard or something called like that.  It was by a restraunt called Bob's.  So we were driving around the city and went on a highway to go somewhere.   There was a lot of traffic that night, and all of the sudden, out of nowhere, we see these bright lights hovering our car and the others.   I looked up in the window and saw a craft shaped like a triangular with 3 bright lights underneath in the middle.  It was hovering over us and kept on going west, but it lasted about 30 minutes and just dissapered in the sky.   The whole thing was black and had no tails like all the other airplanes do.  So that was another good night for me and my dad. ((NUFORC Note:  One of two sightings from same source.  Other report is for October 31, 1996, in;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Triangle in sky hovered for several minutes, moved overhead and flew away within seconds;2008-12-02 21:00:00;3 minutes;Triangle in sky hovered for several minutes, moved overhead and flew away within seconds Was driving home on a residential street in a suburban neighborhood. My 16-year old daughter was in the car with me. She noticed a bright light in the sky ahead of us and asked if it was the North Star. I looked for a few moments, then told her that no star was that bright. I then racked my brain to see if any planets were visible this time of year. The light was approximately 250-300 feet above ground. As we neared closer, we could see that rather than one bright light, it was actually two white lights and two red lights that were blinking intermittently. I said to her, Must be an airplane. As we neared even closer, I wondered out loud to her, But airplanes don't hover. The lights were remaining still in one spot directly in front of us. We could see, too, as we neared, that the lights were lower than first appeared, or perhaps had moved closer to the ground. The lights were not moving at all, other than blinking. It seemed odd and also apparent to me, that at my snail pace of 30mph, I was actually catching up with whatever it was. I told my daughter that we would find out what it was in a few seconds, because we're going to pass right under it. The object was still hovering in one spot. What happened next is unimaginable and outlandish. We passed under the object, which took 2-3 seconds at my drive of 30mph.  As we passed underneath, we could see that the object was triangular with round corners, the body was metallic, and corner of the triangle had a brightly colored light.  One light was green.  One light was red. I believe, but can't be positive, that the third light was white.  Directly connecting the large corner lights were smaller red and white lights that blinked in a row. The front of the triangle (the longer side) had an amazing glow from it, as if from interior lights.  We passed under in absolute shock. As we passed it, we both turned to each other and shouted. That was a UFO! My daughter said. I quickly pulled into a side street and turned my car around, in an attempt to catch back up to the object.  By the time I had pulled in, backed up and turned around the object was almost gone from sight. It was now moving at a ridiculous speed away from us.  I sped up, but within seconds the lights were completely gone from sight. Had my daughter not been in the car with me and witnessed what I had seen, I would have thought I had lost my mind.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Silent triangle craft flies in straight line east to west quicly.;2009-02-08 12:15:00;20 seconds;Silent triangle craft flies in straight line east to west quicly. Today I was taking Christmas lights down out of my oak tree in my yard when out of nowhere I noticed a triangle craft moving quickly though the sky.  Looking up at it, it was silver/white in color and silent.   I am not sure how high it could have been, only that I figure to measure about 1 half inch in width across  the sky.  It moved in a very straight line from east to west.  By the time I could get my wife to see what I was seeing, it was already gone.  	The thing that makes this so unusual to me is the fact it made no noise.  If it was high enough to be  inaudible to the human hear I figure I would have seen a contrail from its engine or engines.  However there was none.  Also, this object was triangular and resembled nothing like an ordinary airplane I am very used to seeing in the skies flying over the mid-west region.

Bright non-blinking lights in a v shape that suddenly dropped from the sky;2011-08-30 03:15:00;15 minutes;Bright non-blinking lights in a v shape that suddenly dropped from the sky I was very suspicious of those who claimed ufo sightings before I experienced this tonight. What my fiance and I saw I still cannot get a full grasp on. What we saw seemed to be rounded with a group of three bright, non-blinking lights in a v shape at the view we had.  It was moving very fast for about 10 minutes and stayed steadily in front of us as we were driving down M-6.  After about a span of watching the craft trying to figure out what kind of airplane it was I pointed it out to my fiance. He was just as confused as I was.  After I had been watching it for about 10 minutes we seemed to be getting closer to it so I assume that it had slowed down.  At the point in which we were almost horizontal from it, it suddenly dropped from the sky. I don't know if it suddenly landed being that it was not that far off the ground to begin with or just went invisible.  That is what I am entirely confused about. My fiance thinks that it was a ufo and to us it most definitely was because it was unidentifiable to anything we had ever seen.  I, myself believe that it might possibly have been a military aircraft being that the stealth fighter jets are coming out this year.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174

Triangular craft with three dim orange lights.;2014-05-05 22:45:00;3-5 seconds;Triangular craft with three dim orange lights. 	Shortly after 10:45 pm I was walking down the sidewalk in front of my house and looked up to admire the brightness of mars.  While looking at the sky I saw what fist appeared to be a single cloud in an otherwise clear night sky. 	I noticed that the object was moving too fast to be a cloud and had a distinctive triangle shape with rounded corners. It appeared to be about 300 feet off the ground and flew directly over me.  When it was directly overhead I could see three semi-spheres on the bottom that were emitting a very dull orange light.  As it flew farther away I lost sight of it when it flew over a street light.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Day lift, bright bar became triangle, then faded away.;2014-05-21 17:00:00;7 seconds;Day lift, bright bar became triangle, then faded away. I was driving PM commute northbound 131, stopped for slow traffic north of 28th St. Looked out driver's window and saw a horizontal, stationary bar of light at 10:00-position, tipped to north, and in tipping became an elongated triangle or wedge-shape, very bright. clear sky & sun behind me off to left.   Traffic was then nudging forward, I looked again at the triangle and it slowly faded then disappeared.  Never changed position.   Size was about thumb-nail at arms length.  Object was flat triangle and had no depth or details.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Four white triangular objects with green lights underneath, closely followed by a smaller, circular, white object, looked like a star.;2015-06-23 01:00:00;30 seconds;Four white triangular objects with green lights underneath, closely followed by a smaller, circular, white object, looked like a star. At first I thought they were birds but then I saw each one of them had a green light underneath.  They were 4 white objects flying at low speed  in a formation like a plane wing, not 2 wings but one.  At times, they broke the formation to touch between them, but always kept  moving ahead. What impressed me more was a round, circular, smaller and not too shiny object fliying right behind them, pretty much similar to a star. In the past couple of months I've seen  other objects a couple of times, circular and like orange color.  First one alone and later like 4 more flying in wing formation,  What I guessed was they might be drones or something, but what I saw last night is definitely out of this world.  I don't know why I don't hear more people talking obout this sights, they seem to be common around here.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
3 bright white lights in the shape of a triangle - same distance and same size - then formed a straight line and moved east.;2015-11-04 03:35:00;30 seconds;3 bright white lights in the shape of a triangle - same distance and same size - then formed a straight line and moved east. It was 3:35 am on 11-4-2015 - I walked outside to let my dogs out.  Looking East, I’ve noticed that lately I can see Jupiter, Mars & Venus to left of the moon in an “L” shape.  I didn’t see the planets this night, they would have been above my house and out of sight at the time I was outside (I can usually see them about 5:30 – 6:00 am).   I saw 3 bright white round lights in the shape of a triangle, but larger than a normal star all the same size and brightness...  There was no solidity to it, just the 3 lights formed into a perfect triangle, no noise.   I usually stand inside waiting for the dogs but this time I walked outside to get a better look, rubbed my eyes, thinking that I just woke up, or that I was seeing stars in a constellation that I didn’t recognize, etc…    I stared at the lights for about 10 seconds, then the 2 lower lights of the triangle came around each side to form a straight line with the middle light and they slowly started moving East and up getting farther and farther away but maintaining equal distance between each other, until I could no longer see them, for about another 20 seconds.  I watched them just disappear… almost like you’d see a satellite in the sky, but these 3 stayed together.    I tried to “de-bunk” what I saw by looking at the placement of the planets and stars at this particular time that night and there was nothing that would have been in my view at that particular time that would have formed this triangle, let alone the movement.   The feeling I had was something other than looking at the stars too, I knew immediately that it wasn’t something ordinary, that it wasn’t a plane or 3 satellites…   It was cold outside and I had no slippers or socks on and was in my pajamas, I never go outside while waiting for my dogs to come in, not even in the summer, I wouldn’t have walked outside if I didn’t think this was something worthwhile to look at…;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
