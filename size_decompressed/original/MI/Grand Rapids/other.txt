Sonic boom?;2002-05-14 00:00:00;seconds;Sonic boom? On Monday night, early Tuesday morning between the hours of midnight and 1 AM, I was in bed at my window geting some air. I heard and explosion, assuming it was thunder, but different. It was immediatly followed by a jet sound. It was curious enough to go outside and take a look. The jet was far gone, but I noticed that the sky was partly cloudy, and no thunder the rest of the night. Sonic booms are very rare here. The boom sound radiated from the west, as well as the sound of the jets retreat, towards Holland/Grand Haven area.(25 miles away).;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174

Multiple orange lights;2013-04-22 23:00:00;1-1.5 hours;Multiple orange lights Orange glowing lights, first just 6 hovering, then they moved into a line and went out of sight. Around 5 minutes later another wave of around flew by,silently. Witness 1 saw them first, when witnesses 2 and 3 came out they did not appear.  Then they appeared with more frequency and numbers.  They seemed to swoop in, (going from East to West)in arcs or vees, and glide overhead, disappearing from sight just a little behind us. The largest wave was over 40, they came in strong waves 5 times, and smaller waves at least 9 times. The intervals lengthened to roughly 9 minutes between sightings, they seemed to be flying higher, except for the last sighting. It was 2 lights, they were first spotted directly over head, where they hovered for a moment, then flew lower and out over the street then headed Southwest and disappeared. They had wings, but no other features were distinguishable other then the orange light.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174

At first they appeared to be stars but I very quickly realized they weren't as they were very low and were moving swiftly... As I continued to drive south, they continued moving east moving out of my sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

White ball of light;2014-06-29 04:00:00;<1 minute;White ball of light 4 Stars in a square formation with a large white circular object that was much bigger than a planet.  The circular object seemed to move south, then it changed direction.  It apparently started to stop and then started to gain altitude.  It quickly receded from view. It would be important to note that the stars are noted for refrence.  This object moved faster than any sattelite and was very abrupt in direction changes.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Multiple craft seem to witness black meteor approach over Grand Rapids, MI.;2016-05-23 23:05:00;20 minutes;Multiple craft seem to witness black meteor approach over Grand Rapids, MI. Event started with two white starlike/satellite-like craft traversing the sky from North to South and parking in the sky above SE Grand Rapids area.  Then two multi-colored light, triangular vehicles moved from West to East and parked it in the Eastern Sky, estimating 10-20 miles east of GR at around 2,000ft alt.   Then a black meteor looking thing traversed the sky from the North, where the two satellites came from, to the South (near over the GRRFord airport) and the black object vanished on the Southern Horizon (I've got buildings around so I can't see the real Horizon).   A few seconds after the black object traversed the sky, a triangle of stars in the Southern sky, which I had previously not noticed except that they were there for at least 15 minutes while I was talking on the phone to my fiancee, suddenly moved in unison as if they were falling out of the sky down and to the left (as if in the direction of the black object's trajectory terminus).   I opened the porch door to tell my night nurse to come see the UFOs and she came out and saw another star fall out of the sky toward the same spot.  She freaked out and ran back inside afraid. I watched for awhile to see if anymore activity, but only saw a few of the blinkies (stars that blink on and off and move around a little - which I usually only see in thunderclouds).  The parked stars vanished while I was watching the triangle drop.   Whole thing seemed like either a greeting party or an interference party for whatever that black thing was.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Large manta-ray shaped UFO frozen on a 45 degree angle with 7 large white pyramid patterned circles on the bottom of the aircraft;2018-07-11 02:30:00;3 minutes;Large Manta-Ray shaped UFO frozen on a 45 degree angle with 7 large white pyramid patterned circles on the bottom of the aircraft It was around 2:00 AM- 2:30 AM on July 11, 2018 in Grand Rapids, we were driving home from a get together in the Rockford area, we got lost and took a common road home called 52nd Street and as we were driving in the countryside, I look to my right in the passenger seat and I see about 100 feet to 150 feet away from me a large Manta-Ray shaped object frozen in the air on a 45 degree slant, the front of the object was white colored and had a ring surrounding the aircraft that had a green light circling through the ring, I began to naturally freak out as we drive past this large aircraft.  As we continued driving, the bottom of the aircraft was exposed with these bright white lights formed in this symmetrical pyramid pattern with about 7 large lights, instantly I tried to debunk the situation using the laws of physics but the object appeared frozen in time over this grassy area, an by that time I knew that this object is way too technologically advanced to be developed by the government, it was like it was using a Anti-Gravity mechanism that allowed to sit perfectly frozen in mid air on this 45 degree slant,  I thought I was possibly hallucinating the whole situation but after calming down and rubbing my eyes and reopening them, the object was still in the same perfect 45 degree slant in midair, I wouldn’t be reporting this if I didn’t see this object so close, I’ve seen videos and documentaries about these sightings but there was never one photo or video showing a object this close to human activity.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
