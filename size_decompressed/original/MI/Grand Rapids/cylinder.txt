Cylinder or Cigar over Grand Rapids;2006-06-04 12:00:00;3 minues;Cylinder or Cigar over Grand Rapids I was taking a walk downtown when I happened to look up and to the west noticed a silver cylinder in the sky traveling about 5 or 10 miles per hour.  At first I thought it was a plane, because it was made out of shiny metal and seemed rather large and only about a few hundred feet away from me.  I didn't see any wings on it and I didn't hear any sound.  At arms length it was approximately 3 inches in length.  There were some cumulus clouds in the sky, so when it passed behind the clouds instead of in front of them, I was shocked.  It was enormous!  Possibly 400 to 500 feet in length.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
