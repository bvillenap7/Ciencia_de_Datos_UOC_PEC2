I know what I saw....I don't care if you don't believe me....;1977-09-01 20:00:00;3 minutes;I know what I saw....I don't care if you don't believe me.... At dusk, and daylight was waining, I sat at my bedroom window on the second floor of our townhome complex.  I noticed a white light coming over the visual horizon and heading in my direction.  It took approximately 1 or 2 minutes for the craft to come into closer view and stopped over our complex.  It was shaped like a top and had spot lights around the entire circumference of the craft.  The lights were like spot-lights and fanned the ground.  It sounded like a turbine engine and rumbled the building.  My brother was next to me but not at the window.  He heard the sound, but when prompted to come look, he refused and waiting to long before attempting to look and missed it.  I went down to my mom and told her what I seen.  She said she heard it but it was a jet.  She didn't believe me and neither did my brother. The following morning, I discussed the event with a neighbor friend who also verified him and his parents seen the same thing.  Humoring me, my mom called the airforce and asked if anyone else had reported anything.  They said no. Granted, I was young and only in 3rd grade.  But as a boy, I know what a jet looks like.  I know what a helicopter looks like.  This vehicle had no wings and no props. and yet it sounded like a jet.  Besides the only jet that could hover that we were aware of was the harrier.
