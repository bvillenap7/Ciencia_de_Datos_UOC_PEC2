Spherical craft the size of a car with a bright red light hovered over the apartment building across from the Holiday Inn;2004-10-06 22:50:00;1 minute;Spherical craft the size of a car with a bright red light hovered over the apartment building across from the Holiday Inn I was standing on the balcony of the fifth floor of a hotel. A sphere with a glowing, bright, red light hovered over a tall, 13-story apartment building across the street from me. I saw at least 50 people on the ground pointing at it. The craft, which was very small - about the size of a car, hovered for about 30 seconds over the apartment building and slowly moved towards me overhead while it was ascending. The hotel is the Holiday Inn in Grand Rapids.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
A bright spherical object with windows around the middle of the craft.  It just hovered silently for 30 minutes.;2009-04-13 07:30:00;40 minutes;A bright spherical object with windows around the middle of the craft.  It just hovered silently for 30 minutes. I came home after visiting with my parents and doing some grocery shopping.  When I turned into the street where I lived, I saw something bright in the sky that was just hovering.  At first, I thought it was a helicopter. Then, I realized that it wasn’t making any noise, and it was much brighter than a helicopter. I have lived on an army base that had a helicopter unit so I knew what helicopters looked like in the night sky. I had noticed that there was a row of windows about the center of the sphere.  I did go into my home to put away my groceries, but something compelled me to go back outside.  I stared at the object for at least 30 minutes. There was no movement.  It just hovered. After awhile, I started to feel frightened and I had a strange feeling of being watched. I decided to get my digital camera, and despite my fear decided to go back outside. I went back outside to take pictures, but the craft was gone.  It was a white bright light, but it is was obvious that it was a sphere.  You could see the outline of the sphere.  I will never forget it for as long as I live.  I was never so scared in my life!;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Red orbs over grand rapids;2013-07-15 21:00:00;5-10 minutes;Red orbs over grand rapids A friend and I were outside our house smoking a cigarette. Neither of us are into ufo lore. A bright red light, looked spherical from our view, flew silently over top of us.  Hard to say how high up but it was a ways, maybe a few miles.  It was moving pretty fast, disappeared over horizon.  A few minutes later we spotted the same or another one, same exact shape.  This one was at a bit lower altitude than the first.  It stopped and stayed in one place for a while and then got back up to speed.  It disappeared over the horizon.   Later that night, my other room mate got home and we smoked a cigarette.  Like clockwork, as I told him about what I saw earlier another one appeared, this one much closer than the others.  Much lower altitude.  This one didn't have any light emitting from it though. Looked like a black ball.  By this time it was getting dark so we couldn't make out any details on it.  It eventually disappeared into the horizon too.

5-6 orbs in the form of a line in 4 and 2 behind it with gaps in between. Yellow/orange colored over antenna in the city;2016-02-21 20:45:00;4 minutes;5-6 orbs in the form of a line in 4 and 2 behind it with gaps in between.  Yellow/orange colored over antenna in the city 5-6 sphere orbs floating over a cellular antenna as we were driving threw the city on the express way.  When passenger noticed the yellow/orange orbs floating, I glanced and witness them floating.  I would describe it as looking at Christmas lights in the form of 3-4 in a line and 2 behind them in a line with a gap between them.   After looking away then glancing back it disappeared as we drove in a direction out of sight.  We turned around to see if we saw it in the sky and it wasn't visable.  It was pretty noticeable and I am really hoping there are other witnesses to this sighting.  I've seen this once before over two years ago in the same city.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Metallic sphere sitting motionless with sudden disappearance.;2016-09-28 03:00:00;15 seconds;Metallic sphere sitting motionless with sudden disappearance. Was driving north on a road running parallel to the Grand River and noticed a metallic looking sphere in the sky.  Seemed to reflect light from all around, only there were dark clouds and only partly sunny.  The sun was more to the west, but it still seemed to reflect light from the east, or possibly emitting it it’s self.  It did not move, and was also windy so I ruled out a balloon.   I was about to pull over to the side and get my phone out to try and get some video or picture, but when I drove under some trees and came back out into an open area (lost sight of it for about 1–2 seconds) it was gone.  There was nothing in the sky for as far as I could see.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
