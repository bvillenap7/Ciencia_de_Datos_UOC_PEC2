A green fireball with a long tail moving rapidly and turning the landscape green;1998-10-29 03:30:00;1 minute;A green fireball with a long tail moving rapidly and turning the landscape green My 34-year-old brother, and Air Force vet, was driving home at 3:30AM from work, North on US 131, when all around the area appeared to turn green.  He saw a green glowing object like a fireball with a long tail moving rapidly west to east across the sky.  In less than a minute it disappeared behind a small cloud but never reappeared.  Please see the report for 11/2 also.  He said it was like a comet, but too bright and too low to the ground. There was no sound.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Blue-green fireball appears, lighting the ground all around.  Long tail has a small white light on it;1998-11-02 03:45:00;1 minute;Blue-green fireball appears, lighting the ground all around.  Long tail has a small white light on it My brother, and Air Force vet, is once again travelling north on US 131 when he sees the fireball similar to the one seen on 10/29 except more blue in color with a small white light on the tail.  Again it's moving rapidly, lighting the ground all around it's blue-green color, and again it disappeared suddenly.  After a couple days he discusses this information with my son who admits to seeing it on 11/1 at 1:30AM.  Since that time we have not spoken much of the incidents.  Being skeptics at heart, it's difficult to adjust to a change in perceptions and beliefs.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Michigan Fireball  500 Lights On Object0: Yes;2002-08-10 11:15:00;30 min;Michigan Fireball  500 Lights On Object0: Yes I was driving to my aunts house, it was a saturday morning about 11:15am. Clear blue skys with few thin hazy clouds, when I finally arrived to the hous and park the car on the driveway for some reason (maybe because of the awsome weather rare in west michigan) i looked slighly up  and there it was, a small burnt orange ball in the blue sky it was stationary, I imediatlly called my aunt to come out and see the thing and with her came out my uncle and cousin, we all streared with disbelieve, the object did moved a bit side to side but that was only perceivable when looked at for seconds straights. It is very hard to come up with a approximate size or distance since the sky was so nice, but for one second I thought it might be a hot air balloon  so I asked my aunt  if she had binoculars or something like it, she went inside and handed me a set of bird watching monocular ( it looks like only one side of a binoculars. It took me a while to sight the object with the monocular but finaly I did and TADA! it was not a baloon, The best description of the object is a big red sphere with three smaller orange smi-spheres toghether, one thing that was very interesting was that we were able to see  some sort of vapor around it (like when the asfalt is very hot) The object started moving slowly  north, almost like drifting, then it stop completly and started moving south east this time a bit faster and longer to the point that we almost losted in between houses but all of the sudden the thin just rocketted  north west to the oposite side, the speed was not super super fast but but it was faster than anything that I have ever seen flying including fighter planes specially considering how hight it was. just a second after the thing blasted across the sky what it look like a business lear jet cross the sky with the same trajectory almost as if it was fallowing IT.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Intense fiery, orange light that appeared to move slowly towards us in the night sky, changed course, then disappeared;2009-08-15 22:05:00;2 minutes;Intense fiery, orange light that appeared to move slowly towards us in the night sky, changed course, then disappeared At first I thought it was a satellite, then I thought it was a meteor.  The altitude and the speed were too consistent to be either.  It should have gone over our heads in the direction it appeared to be heading, but then it turned and went around us.  It was a bright fiery orange light that gave off a very soft humming noise.  It was visible for what felt like two minutes before it faded away and disappeared. After the light in the sky vanished, I saw what looked like lightning in the distance around all of the trees on the lake.   As we were coming in to dock the boat, I looked around the lake one last time and saw some flashing lights on the ground and they were orange also.  It was like fire that flashed 5 times, and then disappeared and moved to another spot then flashed again and disappeared.   It was amazingly terrifying!

I saw four flying object that looked liked fire all moving quickly across the sky with no sound or noise that you would expect from a plane.   They were heading from West to East at the same speed and after several minutes they appeared to get smaller as if gaining altitude and then they disappeared one at a time.  The first two disappeared withing 5 seconds of one another and then about 30 seconds later the third vanished followed by the fourth only 10 seconds after that.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
