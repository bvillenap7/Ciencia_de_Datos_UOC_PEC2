We saw two red dots of apparent unearthly origin.;1996-08-15 02:30:00;20 minutes;Summary : We saw two red dots of apparent unearthly origin. A friend and myself saw a small dot that was very hard to notice at first in the sky directly above us.  We were star gazing.  It was very high and it was red.  It wasnt a satelite or any conventional aircraft.  It would slow down and speed up and most oddly it would make turns of which i have never seen at the speed in which it appeared to be traveling.   After 20 minutes or so it disappeared over the treeline and the 10 minutes later it returned with a second object, also moving about oddly.  They both dashed about for a few minutes, going in triangle shaped motions, then eventually disappeared again, for good this time.   I have told many peopel this story and i was referred to this page by one of them, so there is my story.  I still dont know if it was a ufo, but thats what I believe it was.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174

Small distant white light floating about the east side of Grand Rapids during the night.  Flashing green and red lights, not much movem;1997-08-12 01:00:00;1 hr 20 mins;Summary : Small distant white light floating about the east side of Grand Rapids during the night.  Flashing green and red lights, not much movement, but aparently a UFO because it was gone less than an hour later.  Had small movements, but kept generally steady and remained in the same location for over a half hour. The object was a white light with green and red flashing lights.  The white light appered to blink on and off, or just different brightness.  Well I was sitting at a local school at about midnight when I looked up and noticed the flashing lights.  When I began to study it more, I noticed that it was not a plane because it wasn't moving.  I thought that I saw it moving up and down swiflty but not more than just a little, so maybe my eyes were just shifting.  Then I thought that it was just a star blinking.  So I called the police department, and they told me serveral other people had reported the same incident.  Well, I wasn't sure then.  I got a friend and showed him, he didn't believe that it was a UFO, he said it was just a star.  So I gave it up, I mean who would believe that I saw a UFO anyways.  So I went on AOL for a while, and I went back out to check it at 2:30 am, and it was gone.  No trace of the object anywhere.  How many stars can disappear like that.  So I came ! here to report it as soon as I was convinced. As far as I know, there was only one object.  I only saw one that is.  And it really didn't have any shape.  I mean it did look like it was very far away.  A coulpe of things, there was another star on the west horizon, which the police thought I was seeing, and it wasn't it.  And there was a meteior shower tonight, but It wasn't that either.  So people might try to say I'm seeing things, but I know what I saw. I'm an 18 year old male, fresh out of high school.  I'll be attending college in the fall.  I've always belived in UFO's, in fact I think that they aren't friendly.  They might be nice, but why would they be so secret in learning about us.  I'm not mentally retarded, in fact I graduated the third highest GPA in my class.  I was not drunk nor high on anything.  My friends will prove that to you that I'm not into that junk.  Well, I've said enough, believe if you want to.  But be prepared whent he truth comes out, I think you'll be shocked.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174

Erratic bright pinpoint of light fading to red before disappearing;1999-11-16 18:25:00;7-10 seconds;Erratic bright pinpoint of light fading to red before disappearing Last night, 11/16/99, at about 6:25pm EST, I observed a white light about the same color and size of  the planet Jupiter and perhaps a bit brighter. The light traveled in a southwest to north east direction across an arc of the sky roughly equal to the apparent distance between the tip of my thumb and the tip of my outstretched forefinger at arms length. The light seemed to follow  a slightly meandering path, though that might have been an optical illusion (I&#8217ve noticed that the eye is often fooled when trying to follow the path of blinking lights, like a distant airplane, at night. While this light was not blinking, the same effect might have been occurring here.)The light started out bright white and gradually faded to a tiny dull red point before disappearing completely. In total the object was in view for 7-10 seconds. In my opinion it was moving too slow for a typical meteor. It also lacked the characteristic streak of a meteor. This light was a distinct pinprick of light throughout the observation. It actually resembled a satellite, but the fading effect and the apparent erratic course was unlike any satellite I&#8217ve ever seen. Thinking it was an airplane, I made a conscious effort to discern strobes. There were none. I am 42 years old, work in marketing at a major national corporation, and have no bad habits that affect my powers of observation. I am an experienced outdoorsman with a better than average familiarity with aerial and astronomical phenomena.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Lights were not stars;2002-11-15 22:10:00;???;Lights were not stars The night sky was clear.  I noticed out of eastern window of my apartment that there were two lights in the sky at about 45 degrees that were blinking which resembled stars-yet they were moving ever so slightly.  They were rather high in the sky, so I chalked them up to being stars (the twinkling thus being caused by atmospheric disturbances), and went about my business.  20 minutes later, I returned to the window and they were no longer there...;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Group of Lights Flying in Exact Formation;2005-08-19 21:50:00;10-12 seconds;Group of Lights Flying in Exact Formation I was looking out my window enjoying the warm night air, when I happened to look up and noticed several round lights roughly 1000 feet up traveling in pyramid formation, heading from the northwest to the southeast.   They slowed and stopped almost directly over the house.  Suddenly, I noticed 1 small light hurrying to catch up with the group.  It joined the cluster then the whole group moved in exact unison toward the southeast hurriedly.   Even though I have had numerous experiences with UFOs and the like, I have never seen anything so graceful and co-ordinated.  Each craft was exactly spaced from one another but that being so, they acted as ONE craft.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Pulsing light over Grand Rapids;2007-06-20 01:30:00;10 minutes;Pulsing light over Grand Rapids I couldn't sleep, so I went outside to watch some stars.  I wasn't out there long before I noticed a light slipping down from the sky in the North East quandrant.  It suddenly stopped amidst the background of stars and began to pulse a white light.  It remained stationary there for several minutes before moving on, very slowly, to the north...  I was told that the International Space Station crossed over West Michigan that same night, but does the space station have the capability to stop on a dime?  Pulse white light?  Change direction?;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
Pulsing lights;2007-06-28 02:30:00;10 seconds;Pulsing lights I couldn't sleep, so I went out into the backyard to stargaze.   After about 45 minutes, I noticed a slowly pulsing light directly overhead moving North.    A second later, I saw another one following right behind it.  They would pulse every 3 seconds, then fade out.   At arms length, they were roughly 7 inches apart from one another.   It was similar to the craft that I saw earlier this month.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174

It passed behind some trees, stopped, dimmed, then changed direction and began heading south, (right towards me).  I watched it as it slowly drifted over my head.  Every 3 seconds it would glow white-hot, then fade out.  At arms length, it was about the size of a pea.  This isn't the first time I've seen this craft.

At first, I thought it was a plane (since we have an airport in the general vicinity),  but after a second or two, I realized that it had no blinking lights on the wings. I then listened for a sound... There was none.  The speed at which it was moving was also in question: it was slow and methodical...about 5-10mph at best.  As it climbed overhead, it began to fade, until there was nothing left to be seen… ((NUFORC Note:  We assume that the source implies a nighttime sighting.

After this, being totally amazed by what we saw two more bright lights the same color e going in the same direction came zooming by doing the same thing and after about a minute after that one more zoomed by going in the same direction. A week later during the 4th of July, we were watching the fire works at the same time of night and saw the same thing but this time there was only two and it seemed that people were trying to set off fire works to blow them off close to them.

The responding sheriff deputy and I possibly saw the ufo at 90k feet leaving Earth. On the horizon, in the south west, was a bright light looking like Venus or a star.  This ufo was approaching at about 30 mph.  About 1-2 miles out.  About 3 football fields up from the ground or a 1,000 feet up from the ground.  It almost collided with an outbound jet traveling from the south east and going north west at about the same height.  Paths of the jet and ufo crossed, just about overhead, about a 1/4 mile to the north by northwest.  The jet can be heard in the video I took.   The ufo would not show up on my smart phone screen as a videoed.  Only the blink, blink of the jet showed up on my phone screen as I recorded.   The ufo was recorded when I aimed the camera eye at the peak of a 30 foot building with a mercury light on the side of the building.  The mercury light is the size of a beach ball and is seen in the lower left of the video.  The mercury light is about 3 feet down from the peak.

It was coming from the south very slowly and as it approached overhead it came to a full stop and dimmed out of sight.   Then I noticed another object of the same description slowly following in its path.  As soon as that object reached the position of the first one, they “greeted” each other with a simultaneous bright red flash then moved in unison slowly to the north - dimming and brightening as one unit until they were out of sight.

Light was a little less than the apparent brightness of Venus, traveling at a high altitude about forty degrees above the horizon. The sky was still light enough that no stars were yet visible, though the crescent moon was clearly apparent in the southwest sky.  Had time to grab my binoculars from my car. Through the binoculars, the light appeared to be a single steady point of light with no colored navigation lights or strobing.  The light traveled in a straight line, moving at a steady speed from the southeast toward the northeast. It was visible for at least 90 seconds before fading in the distance. I thought it might have been the ISS, but checking with tracking apps showed the ISS wasn't due to be visible in my location in the NORTHWEST sky until several hours later.;42.9561763702802;-85.6434235079174
