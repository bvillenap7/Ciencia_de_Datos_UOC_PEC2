Sitting in my livingroom last night, observed through the window (southern exposure) an object traveling at high speed from North to South overheard. Object appeared like a Meteor, Green/White in color, leaving a trail of bright light behind.  Passed quickly through my field of vision.  Quite large in size, Nickle size at arms lenght, appeared NOT to be an airplane or other man made object due to speed and size.;43.2674;-83.7877
