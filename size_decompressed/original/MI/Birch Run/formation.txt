Seen from my livingroom window, looking south, appeared to be 30 degrees above the horizon, moving from West to East.  A line of 4 or 5 glowing objects in a train formation, white in color. Sitting in my livingroom, listening to VHF radio scanner, heard a fellow tell whoever he was talking to that he had just seen a huge comet or something moving across the sky.  I looked out the window, and from my seated position on my sofa could see a streak of fire/light contining four or five very large fireballs, moving across the sky towards the eastern horizon.  I rose from my chair and moved to the window to see just a faint view of them above the neighbors house, lost to the Eastern horizon.  I commented to my wife of what I had seen, but I don't think she had an opportunity to see them.  I was reminded of the string of pearls photos that I had seen of the asteroid that struck Jupiter a few years ago.  It reminded me very much of that.  I perceived it to be a huge falling star, several individual objects, very, very bright in color, almost white, moving at a very high rate of speed across my field of view.;43.2674;-83.7877
