small ball of light expanded sudeenly (about 10 times its original diameter, shrunk & disappeared;1999-08-10 22:30:00;30 seconds;small ball of light expanded sudeenly (about 10 times its original diameter, shrunk & disappeared My girlfriend & I were out in a field looking for Perseid activity. It was a moonless night, although there's a lot of light pollution here. As we are near Detroit Metro airport, there is a lot of air traffic. We were looking in the northeast. A ball of white light approached from the north. At first we thought nothing of it, figured it was a plane. As it approached the 10 o'clock position above us it suddenly swelled to about 10X its previous diameter. It remained at this expanded size for about 10 seconds, then started to diminish. As it approached the 11 o'clock position (almost directly overhead) it disappeared). The whole time its speed was not extraordinary. What set it apart was a lack of marker lights (no green or red flashers) & there was no sound. We see a lot of plane traffic & this was totally anomalous. It also left a trail, but was moving too slowly to be a meteor from the Perseids. Thought I'd pass it along in case there were other reports of this occurance. It gave us both goose-flesh & jitters for quite a while.;42.3191636363637;-83.3771090909091
Object came falling from sky, then lit up, and hovered fast back and forth.  Then went into cloud and disappeared.;2015-01-28 05:08:00;45 seconds;Object came falling from sky, then lit up, and hovered fast back and forth.  Then went into cloud and disappeared. I was sitting looking out ny back door when I seen an object falling from the sky.   It then lit up while falling into a really bright blueish white light.   It continued to hover and fly fairly low to the ground and made movements I have never seen an aircraft do.   It then went back and forth up and down for about 30 seconds.   Then went up into a cloud light went off.  Then it flashed in the cloud, then never seen again.  It was the most thrilling thing I have ever seen in my life.;42.3191636363637;-83.3771090909091
We saw a light, whitish blue, flying just below cloud level, moving slow.

It was not pulsating or flickering...no sound.   The object was moving at the same speed of a passenger plane slowing to prepare for landing.  The object was moving southeast at a steady speed, then straightened to due east, then turned northeast.  No sound and even flew near a passenger plane...possibly under the planes path.  We just saw the same thing tonight as we waited to watch the International SpacebStation fly over at 9:00pm.   So, within 21 hours, we saw two orb UFOs and the ISS.  Great day.  My location has been a bit of a hot spot for UFO sightings.   Many people in our zip code area has seen tbe same things.;42.3191636363637;-83.3771090909091
Hundreds of constant lights traveling at a constant speed.  ((Spacelink satellites??));2019-12-26 22:30:00;30 minutes;Hundreds of constant lights traveling at a constant speed. Hundreds of lights traveling same speed in the same direction, not flashing lights. Extremely high in the sky.  Traveling opposite of the cloud and wind direction.  Typically in formation of triangles or grids of 3-5 crafts.  This has been going on for over 30 min.  There were other commercial airplanes flying in the opposite direction.  These lights were scattered over many miles in all directions, not just a straight line.;42.3191636363637;-83.3771090909091
UFO Sighting: Westland, Mi.   ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-03 22:03:00;15 minutes;UFO Sighting: Westland, Mi.  At 22:02 I stepped outside to my back patio for some fresh air. At 22:03 I noticed what appeared to be the ISS moving from the west to a east northeast path. A few seconds later, I noticed another light from the same direction following the first light. So now I know it is not the ISS.  I make a phone call to a friend at 10:04pm, no answer. I yell inside the house for my family to come and witness what I am seeing. More keep coming, in a single line path. My two sons come out on to the patio and they help me spot each one as they fly from the west. At 22:13 I called another friend, he lives 3 miles south of me. He did see the last 4 objects.  We counted 25 of these lights. They looked like the ISS flying over, orange light, similar speed as the ISS, and no sound. I'm just not sure if these objects were inside the atmosphere or not. It looked like they were entering the atmosphere from the west and leaving it in the east northeast sky.  For the record, the ISS, or no other satellites, were scheduled to fly over at this time.  I tried recoding a video. The objects would not show up on my phone.  There was a very bright white 3/4 moon just a few degrees south of the line if direction these objects were moving.;42.3191636363637;-83.3771090909091
