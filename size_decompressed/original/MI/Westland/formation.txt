Nine multoclored flashing objects in formation, flying over my house.;2016-06-11 21:40:00;10 minutes;Nine multoclored flashing objects in formation, flying over my house. My wife called me outside when she saw a flashing light in the sky overhead.  It was heading north to south.  Appeared near the clouds.  Multicolored...red, orange, yellow.  They almost looked like planes at that distance.  Yet smaller.  But no noise as a jet.  Not a sound.  One after another.  Just guessing... 2 miles apart.  Exact same path.   After the eighth one, the ninth came from a slight different pattern.  More from northeast but heading in the same direction as the others.  No commercial planes ever fly that close together.  Just as the last one was gone south, a commercial plane flew over our house.  We are close to the DTW airport.  It was loud, flashing lights like all craft of its nature.  And then a second.   My question is can you ask a pilot landing here if they saw the same lights?  I know they had to at least seen one or two.  We did not video record it because it happened so quick and certainly didn't expect to see that many.;42.3191636363637;-83.3771090909091
