Possible Metro Detroit U.F.O.;2010-10-31 01:23:00;5 seconds;Possible Metro Detroit U.F.O. I was standing on my porch at 123 am halloween night 2010 looking to the east for sattelites and started to see something straight above me so I looked up and saw a half of a v formation,   There were 5 dimly lit orangeish shapes that made the right side of a  v heading east very fast.  It wasnt a bird or geese formation and it was completely silent and was alot faster than any plane or wildlife formation I have ever seen.   I look to the sky every night because I go outside to smoke and this event has really made me a believer in other life forms!;42.3191636363637;-83.3771090909091
Thirty-two noiseless orange lit triangles flying through the night sky.;2012-09-29 09:10:00;7 minutes;Thirty-two noiseless orange lit triangles flying through the night sky. A series of orange lit triangles came from over behind a some trees  moving from north east to south west in a random group.  One, then two, then another one, like a sloppy aircraft carrier take off formation, at an altitude of approximatly 2000 feet and slowly rising  with no noise.  I watched these objects move through the sky for approximatly seven minutes till they were out of my vision.  The sky was clear at that time along with the moon and stars.   An excutive jet had come by 3 minutes previous to the sighting.   I am a 57 yr old man previously employeed by Ford Motor Company as a service engineer.;42.3191636363637;-83.3771090909091
