Early 1970's, object going around the sun.;1970-10-15 10:00:00;20 seconds;Early 1970's, object going around the sun. Until now, I didn't feel a need to share.  I kept on trying to act as if I didn't see what I saw.  I believe the year was 1970.  I was in line to go into my elementary school.  I glanced up, and my friend was with me, dont remember who she was, but I'm sure she has this same memory, wherever she is today.  I saw something black, going around the sun several times.  This was the middle of the day mind you.  I was not seeing things, I know I saw something, and it was very real to me.  I don't know what this means, but maybe, someone saw something similar around that time?  One never knows.  Thank you for giving me a place to say this.  It's been 32 years!

Orange light;2009-07-25 00:48:00;20-30 seconds;Strange orange light flickers while moving north, appeared to be below the clouds, level flight, not too fast but faster than departing or arriving aircraft to DTW. watched it travel through a 40 degree arc until it went out of sight beyond the trees.;42.3191636363637;-83.3771090909091
Three red glowing objects;2013-06-02 23:30:00;10 minutes;At around 11 30 p.m. three red glowing objects came from the north and were going south. They came a few minuits apart and followed the same basic path.  The first one, which I have included a still image of. was lower than the other two. The clouds were quite low that night and it was below them.  Id say under 200 feet.  The objects moved steadly and made no sound. I have also included video of one of the other objects, this one was higher up than the first one.  This video needs freeze frame zoom analysis.  It is hard to film these objects because of their glow, the camera cannot focus on them.  But the still image I have is quite clear.  I don't know what this thing is but it went right over my head;42.3191636363637;-83.3771090909091
Light in sky for 3+ hours.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a twinkling star, maybe Sirius.  PD));2014-12-28 21:00:00;3+ hours;Light in sky for 3+ hours. The lights I seen where a ray of colors.  Looking out my window looking south sky.  To give a area I was by the Westland Mall.  It stayed in that area and did not move for 3+ hours clear sky.   Planes had not been in the area in truth it seemed air craft where not heading in the area toward Metro Airport.  I was in my house watching a movie and for the whole movie which is 3 + hours long.   IT was there.  I could not stay awake anymore and went to bed hoping to hear reports when a day or two past of no report I had to report.
