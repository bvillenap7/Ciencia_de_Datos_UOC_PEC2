3 large orange balls of light in motion formed a triangle then disappeared in the distance.;2010-06-13 23:30:00;>5 Minutes;3 large orange balls of light in motion formed a triangle then disappeared in the distance. I had been sitting in my girlfriends’ car in the street across the street from my house for about thirty minutes when we decided to go inside real fast then leave to a friend’s house.  My girlfriend beat me outside by a few minutes when I walked out she was standing on the sidewalk at the end of the driveway.  I walked down the driveway towards her when I noticed a plane pass by that was low to the ground and I had commented how it looked cool in the night sky. As I looked back down at my girlfriend she was pointing up in the sky just slightly to the left from where I seen the airplane and said, What’s that?  I looked and it was jaw dropping.  There were 3 circular orange balls of light in a straight line and the one farthest to the right seemed to fly in a circle around the middle one.  It was jaw dropping because the lights where brighter than any star in the sky and they were fairly large.  The only thing I could think of to do was run inside and yell for my brother to come out side and see this.  As I came back outside with my brother the lights had formed into a large triangle and he told me to run inside and grab the camera. When I came back outside the lights where still there but one seemed to dim then disappear, then another, then the last one was gone.  I do not believe it was a flare or anything like that because when it disappeared you could see them move off into the distance and not burn out.;42.3191636363637;-83.3771090909091

First spotted one at 10:30 pm, circular,lights around,top lights big,looking like glowing eyes, with a longer strait ship following behind.  It sat mid air,no sound for 25 min before slowly moving foward. It spun on it's axis occasionally.  At 4 am I went out to smoke, seen 3 craft, put on shoes and walked 6 blocks to 711, counted over 30 at various points in sky.  Some close,some way up,it was a clear night,also some smaller oval shaped craft, I could look right up and see, clarity in sky was perfect.  Next day,bout 7 pm, I seen one behind some cloud cover.  That evening,circular craft, but counted like 12 to 15. Last night seen about 5 ,but they were further off, only one closer to the point could be seen clearly.  The 4am walk,I called pd, airport PD,news, border patrol,.  I showed a Westland PD officer, he and several others said it was a plane,but it never moved and finally turned showing circular shape. No one knew what it was.;42.3191636363637;-83.3771090909091
