Approx 50-75 feet above us, 30-40 ft diameter, metal, saucer shaped UFO, colored lights all around, 2 bright white lights.;1978-04-19 23:00:00;2 minutes;Approx 50-75 feet above us, 30-40 ft diameter, metal, saucer shaped UFO, colored lights all around, 2 bright white lights. Approx 50-75 feet above us, 30-40 ft diameter, metal, saucer shaped UFO, colored lights all around, 2 bright white beams of light, one pointing on the ground, the other straight ahead. Slowly flew over the middle of street in front of our house going from west to east during a blizzard. As it got to the end of the street, the down light came up to face straight ahead like a pair of headlights. My son was outside shoveling the driveway and saw it first. He cannot remember how long he stood outside watching the UFO before I came out. A series of musical notes that I heard drew me to the window and ultimately out to the porch. There was no radio or TV on in the house to produce the notes I heard. We then watched it for a couple of minutes in complete silence until it disappeared in the poor visibility of the falling snow.
