As I was smoking, it seemed to be moving left and right, but I thought it was just me moving. So I went down the stairs on my porch and the object began to move downwords towards the trees. I could see that it was bright red with a circling red light underneath it. It was also moving left and right, which really freaked me out. It was approximatly 3-4 miles away. As it was moving up and down, left and right, it finally went below the tree line. I have always kinda believed in UFOs, but used to think a lot of the stories were made up, and the people were just wierdos. But last night was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. It sent chills up and down my spine, I got tears in my eyes, and I was shaking. I promise all of you, this was a UFO.;45.2644;-85.2245

I was walking across the road headed towards my car when, I heard a loud military chopper flying low over our small town.  I looked up to see what it was doing and noticed 3 orange orbs floating in front of it at the same altitude.  Looked like they were being escorted west, towards Lake Michigan.;45.2644;-85.2245
