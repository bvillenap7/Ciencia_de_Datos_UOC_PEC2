4 Orange Lights Observed In The Sky;2009-09-18 21:30:00;5 minutes;4 Orange Lights Observed In The Sky I took our dog outside to go to the bathroom, and I noticed four big round orange lights in the sky.  They were bright orange and very solid.  I went in the house and called my wife.  She came outside and saw the same thing.  The light moved around in very deliberate motions(dialoganly, up and down, left to right).  The movement was very precise as if moving into formations.  We observed the light for probably about four minutes total.  Then, one at a time, the lights went out. I don't really know how to judge an approximate distance as to how far away the lights were, but they were obviously much closer than the stars appeared, but also seemed to be quite high in the sky.  I have seen many helicopters, planes, shooting stars, etc, but this was much different.  This was something very strange that I have never seen before.  About 15 minutes after the lights went out, I did observe what appeared to be some sort of conventional aircraft in the sky.  I can not say if this was in any way related to what saw.  If there are any question or further details need, please feel free to contact me.  I would also be very interested to know if there were any other similar obsevations made on this date.;45.2644;-85.2245
Charlevoix;2011-07-17 21:30:00;4-6 mins;Charlevoix around 9:30-ish I was washing my car then i turned around and i saw bright red circles in the sky    i watched it for about a minute and i thought it was just some new fireworks or something then i went in and told my parents and they watched with me and my father told us that he saw the same thing the night before right in the same area  then the lights kind of died out and we watched it go away so we started to think and thought it was UFOs because we did some research and there was another report in Michigan that they claimed to see UFOs;45.2644;-85.2245
