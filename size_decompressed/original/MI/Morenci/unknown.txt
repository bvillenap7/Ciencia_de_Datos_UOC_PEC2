2 white lights heading from souther Michigan to Ohio traveling one behind the other at a high rate of speed. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS.  PD));2007-06-19 22:30:00;15 - 20 sec;((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??  PD)) two white lights heading from souther Michigan to Ohio traveling one behind the other at a high rate of speed 	On the night  of June 19 2007 at 22:30, I was taking pictures of the moon and various planets.    We (myself and my dad) started the night at about 21:30.  After about an hour  after at 22:30 my dad left to let the dog in.  No sooner then he got inside that two lights appeared one right behind the other.  I ran in told him to come back out and take a look.  	Once we both were back outside we watched them as they traveled the sky.  My dad ran back in to try and get a camera since the one I was using with the telescope would not pick them up without the help of the telescope.  Them moved to quickly to make it back in time.  	Just as fast as the had appeared they disappeared.  With my dad being in the Air force and myself in Army aviation, we both feel that they were not planes and any other known aircraft.  The stayed the same distance apart from each other and gave off no sounds of an engine.  The both had just a single bright white light and moved at a high rate of speed faster then a plane would be moving.  They were only there for about 15 sec longer then a shooting star would last and also had no tail.  They were heading to the East, if I had to I could shoot an azimuth.  	Just to help my case and so you do not think I am just playing around, I am a college student in biology and earth  & space science. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??  PD));41.732;-84.2234
