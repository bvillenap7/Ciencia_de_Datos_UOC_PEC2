UFO with one orange light followed by 2 red lights;2007-03-25 22:45:00;12 seconds;UFO with one orange light followed by 2 red lights An object in the sky was flying at low altitude at approximately 10:45 PM on 3/25/07. The object had no features of a plane and looked like nothing I have seen before. The object had a bright orange light in the front of it and two medium lit red lights on the back. The object seemed to take a triangle shape on the dark sky. The object seemed to be coming closer and then disappeared within about 10 seconds.;42.2022;-83.1992
