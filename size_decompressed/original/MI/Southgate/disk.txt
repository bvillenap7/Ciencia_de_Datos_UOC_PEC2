Round aircraft, high in sky, had depth or height to it, square windows that spun fast with lights round and round - 100's witnesses;1977-03-27 10:00:00;10 minutes;Round aircraft, high in sky, had depth or height to it, square windows that spun fast with lights round and round - 100's witnesses When I was about 11 years old, my family and I were driving home one evening and up in the sky was a very large, round, metallic looking aircraft.  It had to be really big because it was extremely high in the sky, yet you could still see it in wonderful detail, such as its lit-up windowsp windows.  Although round, the object also had depth to it.  A certain height to it.  Around and around there were rotating lights or windows. The lights or windows that lit up were square in shape, and they rotated and spun super fast, flashing many colors.  It hovered and spun for several minutes and then it flew off in a flash and simply disappeared.  The UFO was silent.  No sound. I did not feel afraid of this craft, but I did of the triangular one I also just reported tonight on your website.  My father, however, felt very afraid.  I will never forget what it looked like because it was unlike anything I have ever seen or expect to see again in my lifetime.  It made headlines in the local Mellus or Mellis Newspaper because hundreds of other people saw and reported it.
