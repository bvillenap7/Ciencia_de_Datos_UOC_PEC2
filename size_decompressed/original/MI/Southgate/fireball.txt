Green-blue fireball  appears over Detroit Metro Area;2000-10-15 01:35:00;8 seconds;Green-blue fireball  appears over Detroit Metro Area I left the house to walk around the block to get a soda at the Dunkin Dougnuts. I was half way down the block, and I saw a round fireball appear just out of nowhere in the skyline. It was greenish- blue and had a tail. It scared me because it was much bigger than any shooting star I've seen. My gut feeling was that if this thing hit,it would cause some damage. It appeared to have just burned out in the sky. The conditions here in the Metro Area,are partly cloudly. This object was behind the cloudcover,but it was so bright,it clearly showed through.;42.2022;-83.1992
