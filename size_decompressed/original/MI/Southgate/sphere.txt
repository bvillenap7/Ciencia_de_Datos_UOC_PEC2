It was traveling south to north, was very fast, and didn't make a sound.  It was about as high as a jet airliner is when it is on approach to land (500ft?).  I am sure it was a UFO because I saw the same type of craft 2-3 days before the incident.  At that time the craft was a farther distance from me, flying from south to north and more east of me towards Wyandotte and the Detroit River.;42.2022;-83.1992
