Looking at Southern Sky was paying attention to moon, when I noticed a red round looking object, at first I thought it was a balloon but after looking closer I noticed moving fast and too big for balloon. It went from west to east quietly then within 4 minute another one passed in almost same exact line of first one. They were very bright red and round as a ball .;42.2022;-83.1992
