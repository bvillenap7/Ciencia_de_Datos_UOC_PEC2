Craft with whight, blue, and red lights seen in the sky;2003-07-01 23:50:00;5 minutes;Craft with whight, blue, and red lights seen in the sky My sister and I were headed west on M59 just north of the town.  We saw an object hovering over the Golden Triangle apartment complex.  It seemed long, and on the bottome of the craft there were 2 lights.  In what we guessed was the front, was a steady blue light, and on the other end there was a steady red light.  Above the bottom lights, there were whight flashing lights.  We turned onto Byron Road, and the craft, or whatever it was, was still visible.  However, when we turned down another road, and into the apartments, it was gone, in a matter of seconds, it disappeared.  We rolled down the windows, but couldn't hear anything.  We drove around a few more minutes, hoping to see it again, but it was gone.  There was a very clear sky that night, and the stars were very visible. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
