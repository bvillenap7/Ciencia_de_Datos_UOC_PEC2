SAUCER SHAPED OBJECT WITH HUMAN LIKE FIGURE INSIDE HOVERS OVER  PROPERTY;1999-11-01 21:30:00;10 TO 20 MIN.;SAUCER SHAPED OBJECT WITH HUMAN LIKE FIGURE INSIDE HOVERS OVER  PROPERTY I WAS LIVING IN HEAVILY WOODED AREA, SITTING IN MY KITCHEN, AT A COUNTER FACING A WINDOW, READING. LIGHT OFF TO MY LEFT KEPT CATCHING MY ATTENTION, I GLANCED UP QUICKLY AND THOUGHT IT WAS REFLECTION OF DINING ROOM LIGHT. I WAS ENGROSSED IN BOOK, BUT LIGHT KEPT BOTHERING ME. WHEN IGLANCED UP MINUTES LATER I REALIZED THE LIGHT WAS NOT TURNED ON. I LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AND REALIZED THERE WAS SOME SORT OF CRAFT HOVERING ABOVE THE TREES JUST PAST THE FENCED IN AREA OF MY YARD. WE LIVED JUST 1 MILE SOUTH OF THE CITY AND THE SKY LINE WAS LIT FROM THE CITY LIGHTS SO I COULD MAKE OUT HTE SHAPE OF THE CRAFT. IT WAS A VERY SLEEK SAUCER SHAPE SEEMINGLY EVEN TOP AND BOTTOM. THERE WERE LARGE WINDOWS SEPARATED EVERY EIGHT TO TEN FEET BY POSTS. THE INTERIOR WAS LIT BY A VERY BRILLIANT LIGHT THAT DID NOT SHINE OUT OF THE VEHICAL ONTO SURROUNDING TREES WICH WAS ODD. STANDING IN THE VEHICAL WAS WHAT SEEMED TO BE A MALE FIGURE , HUMAN IN SHAPE, LEANING ON A LEDGE WITH HIS HANDS ON IT, LOOKING AT OUR HOUSE. WHEN I CAME TO THE WINDOW AND HE SAW ME LOOKING AT HIM HE DID NOT MOVE AND JUST CONTINUED LOOKING AT ME. I WAS FACINATED. BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT FROM THE CITY BEHIND IT I COULD SEE THE CRAFT JUST FLOATING AND GENTLY ROCKING AS IF A BOAT ON WATER. I STARTED SCREAMING TO MY HUSBAND, WHO WAS ON 2THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE IN OUR BEDROOM, TI HURRY AND COME SEE THIS. JUST THEN THE CRAFT GENTLY TILTED SO THAT I COULD SEETHE BOTTOM AND STARTED TO MOVE SLOWLY TO THE EAST. BY THE TIME MY HUSBAND GOT TO THE WINDOW IT WAS ABOUT 50 FEET OFF THE GROUND AND 50 FEET AWAY AND ALL YOU COULD SEE WERE THE RED AND WHITE BLINKING LIGHTS ON THE BOTTOM. HE TRIED TO TELL ME IT WAS PROBABLY A HELICOPTER BUT I EXPLAINED TO HIM THERE WAS NO SOUND SO IT COULD NOT BEEN A HELICOPTER BECAUSE THE NOISE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY LOUD THAT CLOSE TO THE HOUSE. A FEW MONTHS BEFORE THIS THE CITY HAD TO REPLACE A LARGE TRANSFORMER THAT WAS IN THE AREA THE CRAFT WAS IN . A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS INCIDENT I NOTICED CITY TRUCKS IN MY PROPERTY CHANGING TH! E TRANSFORMER AGAIN. I HAD NOT CALLED THEM THIS TIME. THE FIRST TIME IT WAS CHANGED I HAD NOTICED THE TRANSFORMER HUMMING AND CALLED THE CITY AND THEY CAME OUT NAD REPLACED IT. THE CRAFT HAD BEEN OUTSIDE MY HOUSE FAR SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 10 AND 20 MINUTES. 1 OR TWO DAYS LATER WAS A MAJOR METEOR SHOWER AND I WAS OUTSIDE WATCHING IT WHEN A LOW FLYING GREEN BALL OF LIGHT PASSED OVER THE TOP OF MY HOUSE GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE METEOR SHOWER.
