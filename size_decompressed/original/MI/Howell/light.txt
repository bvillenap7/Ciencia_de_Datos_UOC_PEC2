This Morning, Thanksgiving, Nov 22nd, while driving to work from Highland MI to East Lansing MI and passing through Howell.  I observed the following. A bright object the size of a star, moving rather slowly across the sky.  At first I assumed this object to be a satellite as I have seen them before moving at about the same speed.  It was brighter than those I have seen before.  I was thinking perhaps the space station or some other more reflective larger object in outerspace.  This object appeared to be at least 10-20 miles up and probably a lot more and outside of our atmosphere...  Traveling in a straight line from low North to a higher South projectory.  This was in the Western Sky.  Nothing seemed strange about it though, until about a minute later, and keeping my eye on it and driving, it changed Directions.  All of the sudden (and a few holy ****'s) later this object is going directly backwards from its original course.  I know this is not normal.  I am a well informed astronomer and also pretty well versed in physics.  This is Not normal at all and I know nothing of any technology here on earth that could duplicate this fact.  it traveled about the length of 4-6 moons in the opposite direction and while looking for a place to pull over and observe this object was no longer visible. it disappeared but I did not see the disappearance.;42.6272845528455;-83.9230000000001
