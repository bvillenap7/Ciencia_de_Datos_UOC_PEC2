On a night now known as sightings night (March 15,1995) I had gotten out of my car with my parents with me. I had had looked in the sky to find constellations when all the sudden came a triangular ship with 3 blue lights one on each corner. It was so close I could see the texture on the bottom of the UFO. At first I thought it was a plane then I got a better look and it was NOT an airplane then I said LOOK LOOK! My mom looked up and saw it. My dad is blind so my mom told him what we saw. He ran inside and called my uncle and told him what happened. The UFO hovered over the local high school a quarter mile away. Then flew away about 15 minutes later. I later learned that night was called sightings  night and many other people saw UFO's and triangular UFO's like we saw.;42.6272845528455;-83.9230000000001
