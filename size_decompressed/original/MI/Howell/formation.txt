A long line of white lights moving from W to E, absolutely static and rigid, no blinking or sparks, no movement in relation to the othe;1999-11-16 19:05:00;20-30 seconds;A long line of white lights moving from W to E, absolutely static and rigid, no blinking or sparks, no movement in relation to the other lights, no noise. I saw a line of white lights move from W-SW to E-NE, but generally from W to E.  The lights never blinked, burned out, left sparks or changed position relative to each other.  They were spaced roughly evenly apart, with some a little higher or lower than the centerline of the formation. The length was equivalent to a grapefruit held at arm's length. The sky was clear with no stars and a half moon.  The unusual thing about this was that the formation was absolutely rigid from horizon to horizon.  I've seen meteors before, and this did not look like that.  It could have been a solid object.  The altitude could have been 5,000 ft. or 50,000 ft., it was hard to tell.  I was looking about 45-60 deg. up from the south horizon as the formation moved W to E. There were two other planes far away, but none near or chasing the lights.;42.6272845528455;-83.9230000000001
Weird formation towards Lansing Michigan seen from Howell.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-12-22 19:20:00;10 minutes;Weird formation towards Lansing Michigan seen from Howell Lights in semi-linear formation in western sky towards Lansing. Dimmed then brigtened and started moving higher in the sky.  One of them went upwards then backwards and down. They gradually faded out from view about 60 degrees above the horizon. They started at about 35 degrees above the horizon. They did not make noise, there was air traffic visible in the opposite side of the sky towards Detroit and Flint. These were not aircraft, we know the difference from living near an air force base when I was a child. My mother could see better than I could because she has far sharper vision than I (I'm normal, but she's got eagle eye vision). We left after they disappeared and although they didn't seem close the animals in our barn were visibly acting odd when we came in which was strange because the objects were not close, they looked like stars moving around in formation. We can't find anything in the sky constellation/planet wise that resembles it.;42.6272845528455;-83.9230000000001
