I was 1 mile west of where Latson Rd. crosses Clyde Rd. Suddenly, overhead and left of the road I noticed a bright white fireball trailing a line of blue and white sparks descend at a rapid pace.  It was traveling west to east, but was headed in a distinct downward trajectory--as opposed to the few others I've seen personally or on video that travel parallel to the horizon.  Its diameter was about the size of a pea held at arm's length.  It was much larger and brighter than what is seen during a meteor shower (i.e.,  falling stars).  As I said, I first noticed it through the top left of my windshield as it shot downward at what I guessed to be a 60 degree angle.  It descended below the horizon. I thought it might hit maybe 10 miles east of where I was, which would be northeast of the area around Hartland, MI, near the intersection of M-59 and US-23.  I have heard of reference made to it on radio stations that it was a satellite reflection.  No way! Coincidentally, this is the second such object I have seen from this exact location, which I also reported on this web site.  That sighting was a widely-reported trail of fireballs seen across the midwest about two years ago. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness intended to indicate a time of 1939 hrs. (EDT) for this sighting.  We will check.  We have amended the date here.  PD));42.6272845528455;-83.9230000000001

From the top of my windshield, I noticed a bright blue fireball streaking eastward trailing white sparks.  The length of the object and its tail was equivalent to the diameter of a golf ball held at arms length.  It appeared to be heading straight down.  The event lasted about two seconds.;42.6272845528455;-83.9230000000001
