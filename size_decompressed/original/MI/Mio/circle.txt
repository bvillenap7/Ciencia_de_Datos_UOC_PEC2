Huge, round, bright lights in the Northern Lower Michigan sky;2012-01-10 16:45:00;5-7 minutes;Huge, round, bright lights in the Northern Lower Michigan sky Around 6:45 I heard my husband yelling for me to come outside. When I got outside he pointed to the sky and I saw two huge bright lights horizontally next to eachother.  I was in shock and couldn't believe what I was seeing! The lights were big, round, very bright, and seemed to be move around eachother at one point. The light on the right went out, almost like someone turned of a light switch, and then the second light  went out. Immediately after the lights  disappeared i noticed a bunch of smaller blinking   lights surrounding the area where i had seen the lights. We live in a secluded area and are surrounded by federal land. There is a military training base about 35 minutes away. We have a lot of air traffic, military and non military, so I'm assuming we live in some kind of fly zone. This was not an airplane.  I have never seen anything like this in my life. It almost like whatever or whomever it was,  knew we were watching it and turned the lights off. This was either an UFO or had something to do with the military.;44.6648;-84.1394
