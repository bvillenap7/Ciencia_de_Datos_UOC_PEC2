Triangled shape UFO;2004-06-14 23:11:00;20 min.;Triangled shape UFO My friend and I were driving down the road and she had seen this huge redish pink light hanging in the sky when we turned the corner is when i spotted it.  When I said hey, look at that it disappeared. We started going faster down the road and we saw it again, it was flying over us in the sky and we could see under it.  There were three lights spaced evenly in a triangle formation. It just stayed in one spot in the sky, then took off really fast. We got home and the whole time home we were keeping an eye on it. It was zigzagging through the sky that it was dogging something. we ran inside and got the telescope, when we went back outside we started setting it up, the UFO was still there were we left it but higher in the sky and it was the same pink light that was there when we first saw it. The object started zigzagging again and in the distance of where it just left there were spurts of lights going off at a time. there was also a loud hmmmmm sound going off. There are farms around and the animals were making very weird sounds like they were in pain. We got scared and ran inside.;42.4552;-85.0467
