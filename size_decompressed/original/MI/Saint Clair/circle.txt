Satellite drone disguising as a star;2020-09-11 22:40:00;on going;Satellite drone disguising as a star Saw a moving star.  At first I thought it was a satellite, but then noticed an airplane flying west.  Realized it was flying too low to be a satellite, as it was flying below the airplane.  It was moving north to south.  It stopped moving all of a sudden, as if it had been spotted.  It moved left right up down, like a video game controller and then went straight up as if it were disguising itself as a star in the sky. If you were to look in the sky you wouldn't be able to tell the difference if it was a star far way in the sky.;42.8255;-82.5133
