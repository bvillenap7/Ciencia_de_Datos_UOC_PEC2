Triangular shaped light in SE sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of Venus.  PD));2017-01-14 18:00:00;On going;triangular shaped light in SE sky. With Orion on my left and facing south, it's in the South East sky and within the tree line.  I don't know if it's Venus or another celestial body.  It seems triangular shaped and a very white, bright light. Just sitting there and not moving other than seeming to turn.  But that could be atmospheric interference.  I wish I knew more about where things are in the sky. Edit:  This was in the South West sky, not SE  (Orion was on my left) and after 2 hours, it disappeared.  I went out to check on it and it was gone.  It wasn't high in the sky. It was at the tops of the trees.  I checked it about every 30 minutes.  It seemed to just sit there and turn.;42.8255;-82.5133
