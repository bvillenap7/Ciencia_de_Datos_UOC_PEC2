Two unusual Orange colored lights.;2013-08-17 22:15:00;2 minutes;Two unusual Orange colored lights Both my wife and I were returning from her High School reunion and were enroute back to St. Clair, MI.  We were traveling  east on St. Clair Highway about 6 miles west of our destination when I looked to the north briefly and spotted what I thought to be two (2) radio tower lights.  I realized that these were not tower lights,  but something quite odd.  I pulled off the busy highway to get a better look, but the passing traffic was distracting my observation.  The color was a definite orange and was brighter than any other sources such as background stars.;42.8255;-82.5133
