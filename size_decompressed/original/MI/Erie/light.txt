Hi I am a very SPACE enthused person, and star gaze alot at night. Tonight i was looking up at the sky for about 5 minutes, and I thought i saw a object that was a plane.  But the object of light sped up quick in a straight path, then made a 90 degree turn and shot off! From what i thought it was in beginning deftinly was not a plane, because what kind of plane can do that! I prolly stayed outside for another 10 mins looking and came in to report it. Glad i found you guys! ive been watching UFO tv shows for 3 weeks now and yours came across this same night! Glad i could contribute my sighting, if I see anymore I will report it. thanks;41.7819;-83.5003
Unknown lights in tandem disapeared and reapeared;2018-10-31 21:00:00;5 minutes;Unknown lights in tandem disapeared and reapeared driving down the road and saw two extremely bright lights very close to each other, lights then faded until they disappeared, about 30 to 45 seconds later the lights came back on and backwards dimmed would be the best word i could describe.  They dimmed from very very low brightness to extremely bright where they were radiating and reflecting light with streaks coming off of them it was brighter than anything I've ever seen before.  The lights then we're stationary and completely disappeared like they were turned off.  After the Lights disappeared 3 airplanes we're flying at a rapid speed and making maneuvers in a zigzag motion.   I've seen this motion before since I was in airforce for eight and a half years, all three aircraft were doing maneuvers in the shape of a Z. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the source of the report, and he seemed to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  PD));41.7819;-83.5003
