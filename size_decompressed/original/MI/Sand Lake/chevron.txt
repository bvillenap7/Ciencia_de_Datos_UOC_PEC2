A protestant female minister in her mid-fifties saw a boomerang shaped craft in the night sky west of US 131 highway on Wednesday January 29 around 8:30 p.m.  Alone, it hovered for maybe 10 minutes with lights so visible they were seen as separated and recessed in two rows, approximately 9 in all.  I ruled out a weatherball, a commercial aircraft or a surveilance plane because the President of the US was in town that day.  It was facing southeast.  Then either my road turned or it disappeared.  My outdoor temperature thermostat in my car was constantly fluctuating within 20 degrees as I drove that evening.  Usually it is only a 5 degree variance.
