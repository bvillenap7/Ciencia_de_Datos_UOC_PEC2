I adjusted my position away from tree line interference and then object went into a weaving/bobbing pattern in the SE. Again, this is at high speed and a larger light than I've ever seen in the sky. I re-adjusted my position again to confirm what I was seeing. After 3-4 minutes I lost the object to the horizon or possibly clouds. The weather was partly cloudy however the sky was clear in the area where I first noticed the object. Approximate time was 12:50 a.m. 9/19/2015.;43.2995;-85.5316
