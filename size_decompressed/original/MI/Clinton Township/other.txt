On 9/11/11 at around 9:15 pm I saw 7 to 10 orange/red objects moving from south to north in Clinton Twp. MI. Speed was that of slow moving helicopters. Altitude, 500 to 1500 ft.? Size? 8 to 10 stars. I was east bound on 16 mile rd at about Utica rd. when I first noticed them. Saw the first one as it moved out from behind the tree line on the south side of 16 mile. As I continued east more of them appeared. Perhaps as many as 7 by now. They were in a ragged line and as I drove on the front 4 took on a diamond like formation. By now I had gone several miles and chose to pull off on the shoulder to get a better look. I was now directly underneath them. I got out of my car for a better look. There was no sound or change in speed or direction. The entire line, still moving south to north slowly ascended at about a 45 degrees angle and eventually disappeared from view. I was surprised that I seemed to be the only one who pulled over to look. There was moderate traffic at the time and the seeming lack of interest by the other drivers was perplexing. Maybe, I thought, I had imagined the whole thing. At the next stoplight, much to my relief, I noticed the driver of the car next to me looking up in the sky in the direction of where I had seen these odd lights. He appeared to have the 'what the .... did I just see' look on his face. I asked my wife, who was in a separate car not far behind me if she had seen anything and she confirmed what I had seen. Selfridge ANG base is located north and east of where these lights were heading and they probably passed right over it. I am going to call the base today and see what they have to say. I havenâ€™t heard anything on the news nor did I find any thing on the internet about these object so I am wondering if anyone, other than my wife and I and the one other driver, saw them. Oh yeah, the entire event lasted maybe 5 minutes or so.;42.5962842105264;-82.9376157894739
