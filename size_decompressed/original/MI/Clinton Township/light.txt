observed light move across sky then fade out;2000-06-09 23:35:00;25-30 seconds;observed light move across sky then fade out Was outside with my dog and happened to look up and noticed a light in the sky ...it did not seem to move at first, then it moved slowly and seemed to get brighter as it moved.It moved approx 4-5 inches finger width at arms length and then it seemed to emit a kind of beam of light...like a searchlight or spotlight that kind of made a sweeping motion Then it just kind of faded out as it was still moving.I watched the same area for about another 5-6 minutes to see if i could see some kind of navigation lights or something to that effect...but i did not see anything else....it was just there and then it was gone. I was looking in a northeasterly direction...sky was very dark...no clouds in the sky....many stars visible...half moon was to my back At its brightest, object was approx as bright as the planet Venus, yellowish white in color...approx 30-40 degrees above the horizon... The strange part was that it just seemed to appear out of nowhere...i was looking in that general direction and noticed it sort of out of the corner of my eye.;42.5962842105264;-82.9376157894739
Bright light Seen in Clinton Township;2001-06-17 21:30:00;2 - 3 Minutes;Bright light Seen in Clinton Township I was on my way back from working on my boat, when i noticed what looked like a bright light in the sky. It hovered for about 2 minutes then it faded out. ((NUFORC Note:  Without more details about the sighting, we are unable to form an opinion as to what the individual witnessed.  Depending on the direction the witness was looking, the object may have been Mars, which may have been obstructed by light cloud.  That is only a possibility, however.

Bright orange globes hovering and maneuvering in Clinton Township Mi.;2010-07-29 22:40:00;3 minutes;Bright orange globes hovering and maneuvering in Clinton Township Mi. My partner and I were standing in the front of our house having a smoke after dinner.  We were facing the east side of our yard.  When we turned around to go back in the house, we were both immediately drawn to two large, globe-like lights that seemed to be glowing a bright orange.  We live near Selfridge Air Force Base and are very familiar with the aircraft that frequent this area, both at day and night, along with their lights.  These lights were nothing like we have ever seen. The two objects were positioned with one much higher than the other.  They were just hovering. This was for around 1:30 minutes.  The objects then moved very quickly and very near to each other.  The object that was originally lower than the other,  made a rapid clockwise circles, around the other object and the two seperated, both going in seperate directions at very high speeds and just dissappeared. We did not have a camera ready as we were both in awe of what we were seeing, and we both know what we saw was nothing like we had ever seen.;42.5962842105264;-82.9376157894739
Extremely slow traveling white light - 5,000 feet - not a sattelite or space station;2010-08-27 21:50:00;10 Minutes;Extremely slow traveling white light - 5,000 feet - not a sattelite or space station Actually these incidents take place between the nights of 8/27 - 8/30 2010 each night between 21:30 and 22:30.   White light traveling at about 5,000 feet moving East to West at an extremly low rate of speed. The object viewed from binoculars appeared to be a single white light (not brilliant) viewed from front, side and rear, no sound while passing and no engine.  On 8/27/2010 while viewing it at 21:30 hours from my backyard I estimate it was approximately 2 miles away and even with me. I saluted it without the binoculars and the light faded out.  I lifted the binoculars and witnessed the light reappearing approximately ten miles away (in approximately three seconds) and then went out again. On the 28th and 29th the object reappeared traveling in the same direction. My wife witnessed it with me on the 28th.  On the 28th and 29th the light did not wink out.  As it was traveling in the direction of Selfridge Air Force Base I suspect it to be a predator drone ! or blimp, stealth fighter or experimental military aircraft considering the radar that would have captured it from the base and the jets that were availabe to scramble. Surprisingly I see no other reports and unusual that on three consecutive nights it has appeared. Last night, the 29th the light appeared less bright and more amber in color. During each viewing several aircraft could be seen in and around the vacinity at varying altitudes. I will be viewing to see if it reappears for a fourth consecutive night.;42.5962842105264;-82.9376157894739
String of Orange lights acending the sky.;2013-06-08 22:00:00;20 minutes;String of Orange lights acending the sky. After hearing the Booms which at first sounded like a lot of fireworks or a police shootout, we went outside looking east to see a line of orange lights that were spaced about 100ft apart looked to be ascending from South east to north - north east.   We tracked them until they dimmed past the cloud line.  Still hearing booms 30 minutes later but are more singular and no lights.   Selfridge ANG is about 20 miles North East. We thought could be rockets or missiles.   Also heard helicopters flying by;42.5962842105264;-82.9376157894739
Tube shaped illuminated object in the sky at sunset.;2014-09-03 20:00:00;30 minutes;Tube shaped illuminated object in the sky at sunset. I live on the 7th floor of an apartment house with a balcony on the west side of the building. I watch the sunsets nightly, weather permitting. This particular night, the sunset filled the western sky with a brilliant orange, fading to the color of a blood orange. All of a sudden, I noticed what looked like a fluorescent light tube in the sky,in front of the sunset. It was perfectly vertical, appeared to be emitting it's own light and not moving, although the sunset was sinking below the horizon behind this tube. The tube remained illuminated in a white light. It remained stationary until the sunset was gone and at that point it began to fade until I could no longer see it. To get an idea of the size of the tube, I held my arm out at full length and it was the size of my little finger at arms length.;42.5962842105264;-82.9376157894739
AN EVENING THAT CHANGED MY LIFE.  ((Spacelink satellites));2020-03-07 19:00:00;2 minutes;AN EVENING THAT CHANGED MY LIFE. Whilst taking my dogs out, in the western sky a light appeared.  The light zoomed off towards the ordinal direction of the northeastern variety.  After traveling an interval of 5 ticks on a pocket watch, another light appeared at the spawning location of its brother.  The second took off with the same trajectory and speed as its older sibling.  In 5 seconds, the thrice light appeared, and speeded off in exact pursuit of the last.  This happened another 4 times, for a total of 7.   The lights following one another disappeared behind the cloud cover of a warm late winters eve.;42.5962842105264;-82.9376157894739
