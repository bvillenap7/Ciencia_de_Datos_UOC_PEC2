Orange glow crossed shaped object seen hovering;2008-03-08 21:25:00;10 minutes;Orange glow crossed shaped object seen hovering I was waiting in my house for my fiancé to pick me up when my mom ran back into the house from the backyard and yelled, “there is some weird object hovering over our house.  At that time we both walked out the front door and noticed the orange glow of a hovering craft in the SE sky.  The light did not flicker like a plan or helicopter.  From the glow you could see the shape of the craft that almost looked cross shaped.  The craft hovered in the same position for a few minutes and then disappeared into the sky in the SE direction. My mom then informed me the news from what she saw.  When she was in the backyard is when she saw the object appear from the horizon in the SW, soundless she thought this was odd. The craft lifted up she said and then accelerated to the East.  At that point the craft shot through the sky at an unimaginable rate she said, like firework speed, but from a distance.  When we both saw the object from the front yard she thought it was impossible that something could start and stop in mid flight. Again, I only saw the craft hovering, however this was not a star, helicopter, balloon, or airplane.  I have never seen anything like this and I am sure there has to be other reports. At least I would research the FAA logs to determine if a pilot saw the craft.;42.5962842105264;-82.9376157894739
