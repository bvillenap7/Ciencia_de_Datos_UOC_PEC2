For the last three Thursdays between 7 and 9 pm, my son and his neighbors have observed two UFOs in the sky.  They have bright orange lights which go from very bright to non-existent.  They make no sound and either hover in one spot or move across the sky, sometimes slowly and sometimes very fast. They are in the shape of a V from what he can tell. He called me November 8, 2012, about 7 PM, and said, They were back again.  This time I drove to his house and observed them myself and they what he claimed.  His neighbors also saw them. I took this picture and when I uploaded the photo to my computer they definitely appeared to have a V shape.;42.5962842105264;-82.9376157894739

As I approached the red light, I noticed 3 lights, each of them both red and white/clear, like a brake light and headlight (each), in a triangle formation stop over the traffic light/intersection and hover for a moment, and then head northwest (from south east to northwest direction).  It moved very slowly over the top of the trees. When I got home, I posted on facebook that I had seen something strange and asked if anyone else had.  One of the leaders from my church posted that her teenage daughter and friends had been at the intersection of 15 and Utica (southeast of where I saw it), and they saw a huge ball of fire fall from the sky, and then break into 3 separate lights like a UFO and move toward the direction of Metroparkway and Garfield.;42.5962842105264;-82.9376157894739
