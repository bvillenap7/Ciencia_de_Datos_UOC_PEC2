Red orbs.;2014-07-23 23:40:00;7 minutes;Red orbs First sighting was one glowing orb shining bright orange, dimming to red.   It disappeared in thin air, then another appeared.   Then after it, 2 more.   All moving across the sky.  They could not be mistaken for lanterns, as they appeared above the tree line, moved across the sky then disappearing.   Saw the same thing last year, but last time there were about 10.;42.5962842105264;-82.9376157894739
