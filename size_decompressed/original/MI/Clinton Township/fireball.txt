First we had seen just one large orange/red circle that looked as if it was on fire.  Trying to explain what we had seen we assumed it had to be a hot air balloon which would explain the fire.  After watching it for about 5 minutes a second and third one appeared to the west of it i think it would be.  I would also like to add that there were about 10 other people that were there trying to figure out what they were as well. We then decided to drive to a nearby school and ended up seeing 2 more of the fireballs.   We did not however see any fireworks so we went home.  Upon driving up to our house we noticed another one in the sky appearing to be flying north. These objects were going fairly quick to be a hot air balloon but were at a steady pace and height. There is no way it could have been a meteor.  They were definitely flying and not falling.  There was no noise or visible trails left by them. Neither me or my mother believe in aliens. However there has to be an explanation for what these are.;42.5962842105264;-82.9376157894739
Fireball lifted into the sky and dissipated into a cloud.;2010-10-11 23:20:00;15 seconds;Fireball lifted into the sky and dissipated into a cloud. While standing on my back patio I witnessed a quarter-sized, yellowish/orangish fireball levitating in the sky above the roofline of a house.  Having a background in military aviation it is to my best knowledge that the fireball seemed to be about 8-10 miles away.   After a matter of seconds the orb lifted into the sky and dissipated into a cloud.   I don't really believe in alien life forms, this was just an unexplained object unlike anything I have ever seen before.  Thank you.;42.5962842105264;-82.9376157894739

I stared at it, to make sure it wasn't another firework, or flying vehicle, but it never blinked or moved.  It flickered, like a star, but it was much bigger than any star or planet in the night sky.  It looked round, and orange, probably 10 times larger than any stars in the sky.  After about a minute and a half, it slowly faded out, and disappeared.;42.5962842105264;-82.9376157894739
