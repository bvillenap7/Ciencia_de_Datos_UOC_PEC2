Two ufo's near selfridge air national guard base;2012-09-03 21:30:00;2 minutes;two ufo's near selfridge air national guard base My wife and I were sitting on our porch around 9:30pm on 9/3/12.  We live near Selfridge Air National Guard Base and as I was looking up in that direction I noticed a constant bright red light. I am in the military and am very familiar with military aircraft.  As I watched the light, I noticed it moving in my direction (northwest) and slowly turned back east.  The closer the craft came to me, the duller the light became until it completely disapeared.   At this point I could make out the shape of the craft.  As the craft was almost over top of my wife and myself I could make out a disc shaped craft.  I watched this craft move across the sky for roughly a minute and a half until it disappeared. while watching this first craft I noticed a commercial jet flying east but the plane was far above the craft.   After the craft was gone I kept looking up towards the direction the craft came from and noticed a second bright red light.   watched this craft slowly head in the s! ame path as the first one doing everything the same down the to the dulling red light which disappeared at roughly the same point as the first craft.  At this point my wife said something and I looked at her and looked back up to where the light was and it was gone.  Neither craft made any noise.;42.5962842105264;-82.9376157894739
