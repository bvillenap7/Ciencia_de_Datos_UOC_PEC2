Circular shaped craft with flashing lights.;1980-09-16 23:00:00;20 min;Circular shaped craft with flashing lights I did not know they were sights to report this or I would have sooner.   I was leaving a friends house and just happen to look up in the sky.  I called my friends attention to it.  It was oval or like a flying saucer disk you see on TV.  It had different colored lights all the way around it.  As we were watching it, it was like it was motinless without sound.  It hovered with all the lights blinking around it in a circular pattern.  We just stood there and watched it.  It then turned up on its side like a Frizbee being thrown and took off.   I don't tell very many people about this because everyone laughs but I will never forget it.  I'm just not sure about the date it was so long ago.  I was reading one report that sounded alot like mine. ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.5962842105264;-82.9376157894739

It was hovering about 2-3 miles over my neighbor's house.  It stayed there for about 5 minutes and then we left because we didn't think anything of it because my friends and I were 8 years old.  It was grey and oval shaped. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.5962842105264;-82.9376157894739
Multple oval amber orange solid translucent objects appearing to be leaving Earth in the same pattern.;2011-10-14 19:45:00;45 minutes;Multple oval amber orange solid translucent objects appearing to be leaving Earth in the same pattern. I'm not sure when it started, but I got home at 7:45pm, saw them as soon as I got out of the car.  I can't believe more people haven't come forward to report it, it was like nothing I've ever seen.  I got out of the car, grabbed my clipboard and seen lights passing through the trees.  I went up stairs to our third floor apt. I got to be honest, it was kind of frightening.  I went in and called out to my wife to out on our balcony, she tried to tell me they were planes, I told her plane planes aren't orange amber, they have blinking lights, etc...  she went to the bedroom to look again, because she didn't want to be on the balcony cold.  I called 911 to report it, the operator said, maybe their the presidents planes (The President was in the Metro area that day, but he left at 4:00pm accord to Fox news I spoke with as well.) I told the operator how many I was looking at, and he said he hasn't heard anything.  When the 911 operator answered my call, he answ! ered, Clinton Township Police & 911, whats...  I recalled that, so I asked him if he was in Clinton twp., he said yes, so I told to look out the window to the south west, he claims he did, and seen nothing, I asked him how can he not see that, he hung up.  My wife, now with a warm view, could see it as well.  They were oval translucent orange amber color, solid.  When looking out over next buildings roof, and in the distant s.w. sky, there was a lot of them, they appeared to be coming up from the ground, then at a certain point leveled off from west to east, then went up on a 45 degree angle upwards to the southeast, and gone.  If you were to put my view of what I was seeing in a screen shot, there was a group of twenty to twenty five all together, with two here, and three or four to the right, and five or six to the up left of them, etc.  All in a group going in one direction, but not a conformed group, kind of a scatter pattern, but the group followed a pattern.  They'd! pop up, level, 45, and gone.  Then the next group scattered d! ifferent ly, but follow the same pattern.  I called news, nothing, called the selferidge air national guard base, as it is five minutes from me, couldn't get through, I did the next day, they claim nothing was on radar, and no reports.  I had no way to record, or take a picture then I do now!  I did try to take a pic with my phone, but nothing appeared range,I think. I then looked more up to see if I could see anything more, and I noticed way up to the south east, which would have put them in plain view of the base, by the way I seen four stationary ones just sitting there.  They were in a box pattern.  Then I noticed the top two seemed to be fading, and the two bottom slowly slide up, and two from departing group would now take the bottom two box spot.  After 15 minutes eight groups went by, of the big wave, you know the 20-25, started to decrease in size numerically to groups approx. 10, then 5, 4,3,2.  Then about 8:10pm to 8:30pm solo objects, on the same pattern of pop, level,! 45, & gone.  I got some of my neighbors attention, of the ones that were home, but they don't speak English.  I called everyone, and anyone, no one, nothing. By the way, the air base gave me a direct number if it ever occurs again.;42.5962842105264;-82.9376157894739
2 Crafts Spotted Over Macomb County, MI, in April, 2013.;2013-04-21 21:00:00;20 minutes;2 Crafts Spotted Over Macomb County, MI, in April, 2013 My son was looking outside to the south around 9-9:15pm, on a Sunday night and he spotted a relatively large orange orb that was blinking.  He called to me to come check it out and I did.  We went outside of my home and looked south (approximately 5-10 miles away from us) at this object.  This orb was orange ( about the size of an aspirin in a distance comparison) and also pulsating a faint white light while it stayed stationary about 10,000 to 15,000 feet in the sky.  It wasn't nearly as high as a passenger jet would fly, but higher than a helicopter or small airplane would fly.  It was definitely bigger than a helicopter or small plane. There was no sound at all from this craft and while it mainly stayed put, it would move towards the north, periodically.  As I watched this craft for approximately 3-4 mins, I noticed to the southwest of it was another orange orb that was pulsating.  No white light coming from it, but it was blinking and heading directly to the other craft.  It was smaller (about half or a quarter of the size of the 1st craft I saw) and as it came to the larger craft at a fast rate of speed, I thought it was going to crash right into the bigger craft.  It stopped abruptly and hovered near it, both crafts blinking and now the pattern of the light pulses changed.  Almost like they were communicating messages. After about 5 mins, the smaller craft moved more north of the stationary craft and then (almost in a reverse move) came back to the larger stationary craft.  Again, pulsating orange and white lights from the bigger craft and just orange pulsating lights from the 2nd smaller craft. Next thing I noticed was both crafts appeared to be heading north at a slow but steady speed.  All of a sudden, the smaller craft shot straight out to the west at a high rate of speed.  I could see it made a huge distance from the larger craft in just 3-5 seconds.  Nothing made on this planet could change directions that fast and then cover a huge distance.  Many, many miles of distance. I was able to see the smaller craft for awhile, as the entire west sky had no obstructions.  I watched as much of it as I could, periodically checking to see where the 1st larger craft was and shifted my vision back to the smaller craft (still heading due west).  It was only then the light faded out on the small craft, that I couldn't see it any longer and I immediately set my sights on the large craft.  It had moved to the north a bit more and wasn't going very fast.  Lights were still orange and white...still pulsating. Around 20 mins or so, I decided that I needed to head back indoors and that is the last time I saw this craft.  My son and I did not feel anything except for excitement and awe.  Only wished I had my camera working.  This isn't the first time I have experienced looking at an unidentified object near my area.;42.5962842105264;-82.9376157894739
