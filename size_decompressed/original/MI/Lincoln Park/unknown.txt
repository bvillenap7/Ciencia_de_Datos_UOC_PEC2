Sounded like huge jets flying by. Ran outside and saw nothing. There wasnâ€™t a cloud in the sky and you could see the stars. This happened several times. It sounded like it would fly over and shake the whole house and be gone. We live by the airport so we hear airplanes all the time and this sounded nothing like the usual airplane. Plus on a night with no clouds you can always see the lights from the planes flying by. Tonight there was nothing.
