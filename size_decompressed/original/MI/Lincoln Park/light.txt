Unusual rotating lights in the night sky.;2020-03-06 21:15:00;>3 hours;Unusual rotating lights in the night sky. We came back home around 21:15 and we observed unusual lights that were spinning around in the cloudy dark sky and seemed close to us, it moved on the right slowly with a constant spinning movement like a diamond shape and then moved on the top of our house.  We also heard some airplane further coming towards us after a few minutes.  About 1 hour later, the lights moved further back behind the house still rotating in the sky.  We also video taped it but itâ€™s a little hard to see on the video since it was dark.  We can still notice though.;42.2385;-83.1783
