3  round  lights in the sky;1976-08-15 22:00:00;5 minutes;3  round  lights in the sky I was waiting for a friend back in 76 in the Lincoln Park high school parking lot when I saw a bright amber light from the west getting closer and closer. It was a couple thousand feet in the air. Then 2 smaller red lights appeared. One from the north and the other from the north west heading toward the amber light. The red lights seemed to have landed on top of the amber light then suddenly the amber light spead off at an incrediable speed back towards the west. A couple days later it was reported in the local paper that others have seen it also. I have tried locating the article relating to this over the internet, but have not been able to.
