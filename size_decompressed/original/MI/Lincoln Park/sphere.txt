Moved at a higher rate of speed than a normal aircraft that are frequent in the area. It was a circular shaped, orange in color, but it was hard to determant what it was exacly. It had no blinking lights. There is no mistake about what we saw that night, an unidentified flying object in the night sky.;42.2385;-83.1783
