Black BIG fast moving & totaly silent.  Over South East MI.  Came from South headed north.  The front was rounded the back end was straight lines going to a point.  I tried to fill but just turned out black screen.  Took pics of what I thought was a dark trail it left behind but it was actually the clear sky from where it actually cut a line thru the clouds.  It was a totaly calm night.   I can't hardly believe I saw what I saw but as sure as I know the sun will rise tomorrow I freaking seen it!!!  And I'm sure the tower at Detroit metro airport.  HAD to see this thing.;42.2385;-83.1783
