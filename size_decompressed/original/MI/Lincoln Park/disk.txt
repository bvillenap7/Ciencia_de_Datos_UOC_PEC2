Flying saucer over Lincoln Park, Michigan.;2016-06-03 22:55:00;5-10 minutes;Flying saucer over Lincoln Park, Michigan. I was getting off the freeway on my way home from work, when I saw it in the sky.  It was definitely not a blimp or plane.   It was a metallic saucer that was spinning slowly and moving slowly across the sky.  It had three or four blinking lights that would change from red to green.  It was self illuminated and glowing, almost like the moon.  It was quite obviously a flying saucer.   I'll be honest I was very scared and freaked out a little as I have never seen anything like it before.  But I was very certain of what I was seeing.   When I got off the ramp, I followed it for several minutes and got myself a bit lost.  Eventually it flew over a residential area and I lost sight of it, amidst the houses and trees.   I drove around for about half an hour after that but could not find it again. ((NUFORC Note:  We are uncertain as to whether this is a serious report, or not.  PD));42.2385;-83.1783
