Then others were seen. Well, the best i can describe is what we saw was, at first, an orange sphere. It was quite large in the night sky and kind of blurry..and it seemed to occilate.  Then another orange sphere dropped down from it. Very odd. They just floated in the same position for maybe a minute. Then two more seemed to materialize just above the first two. Then two more seemed to fall out of the second group like the first group. they stayed stationary in the same place for maybe 2 or 3 more minutes. We then went back into the cabin.
