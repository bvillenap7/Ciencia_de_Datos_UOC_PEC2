It is a very clear night.  We are camping.   We are looking over the lake and four reddish-orange circles appear in an EXACT angle flying with equal distances apart.   They made no noise.   When each circle hit the EXACT same location, they disappeared.   There is a full moon and you can see other objects, but these literally disappeared once they hit a specific area.
