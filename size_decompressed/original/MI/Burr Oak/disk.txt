The two racers in Michigan.;2005-11-28 22:00:00;5 minutes;The two racers in Michigan. I was walking home at around 10 PM when I was looking for shooting stars. I turned and was looking for the moon when i saw a little flash. Then apeared two greenish blue objects going in circles making loud clicking noises. Then they started to race, i started to run. And then they stoped and flew right back towards the moon.;41.8478;-85.3386
