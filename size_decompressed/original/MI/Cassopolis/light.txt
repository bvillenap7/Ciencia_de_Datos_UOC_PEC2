Bright object with two lights hovering above tree line;2020-04-18 22:30:00;2 hours;Bright object with two lights hovering above tree line One red and one white light together above the tree line with a bright center larger than a star but smaller than the moon.  Every time I tried to take a picture the lights would go out and then come back on.  I even tried to take a video but it moved and the lights went out.  It just stayed there hovering for a very long time otherwise.  It seemed as if it was far away and at least the size of a plane.;41.8973;-85.9918
In-Line groupings of light streaming across night sky and dissapearing at specific point.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-26 22:14:00;30-40 seconds;In-Line groupings of light streaming across night sky and dissapearing at specific point. Saw points of light streaking across night sky, west to north (from Gemini to Hydra atea), in-line and in groups of three, but very close together, moving very fast and very high. These points of light (possible ships?) began to dissapear from front of grouping, like they were going behind sonething, until finally the last one dissapeared.;41.8973;-85.9918
