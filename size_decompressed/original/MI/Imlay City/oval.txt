White oval shaped bright light speeding moving forward then observed making sharp turns;2014-07-12 22:18:00;5 seconds;White oval shaped bright light speeding moving forward then observed making sharp turns On July 12, 2014, at approximately 10:18 pm, my husband and I were traveling east and southbound on Cedar Rd/ M53 Imlay City 48444 just past the Imlay City Police Station. My husband said to me to look up.  It was a bright shiny light like a helicopter but brighter and way, way faster.  It appeared to be following the road we were on. As we continued watching an Imlay City officer put on his lights.  We thought he had seen something and was informing the public.  But he was pulling someone over.  I am certain it is on his dash cam and we did report it to the police.   We called but couldn’t get the officer to call us back or look!  It did not appear to be anything either of us were familiar with such as helicopters or shooting stars.   It diverted sharply in the distance to the left and then continued back on its past headed east.  Also, there was absolutely no sound being emitted from the UFO&gt   My husband worked as a civilian in a tank plant and is also familiar with jets, etc.  This occurred so fast (in seconds) as we tried to catch up and keep our eyes on it, but couldn’t. The local news seemed disinterested so we reported it to you and I would like to put my sighting in writing.;43.0415;-83.074
