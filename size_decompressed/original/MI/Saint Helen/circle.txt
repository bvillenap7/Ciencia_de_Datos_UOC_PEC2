Everytime the craft went by stars the stars disappered for about 10-15 seconds. A red circle in the sky, very high up.  I knew this wasn't a plane because the craft didn't flash or blink.  It did not go strait across the sky, it kept on going back and forth and circleing around until it finally went across the sky and out of sight about 15 minutes after I spotted it.  When this object went passed stars the stars would disappear for about 10-15 seconds, this was the most mysterious event about the sighting.;44.3685000000002;-84.4291000000005
