sparks in the sky;2007-06-12 22:00:00;5-8 seconds;sparks in the sky Last night (June 12th 2007) I was standing outside of my door at the hotel.   I was smoking a cig. looking up at the sky in the northern direction.  I could see many stars in the sky when all of a sudden a star like light appeared out of nowhere.  At first I thought it was an airplane because it looked too low to be a star.  Then I noticed  how fast it was moving and thought to myself that it was moving awful fast for an air plane.  It was moving in an horizontal direction, I believe towards the west.  Then I thought it might me some sort of military jet because of its speed and camp Grayling only being about a 30min car ride or so.  Then all of a sudden the light started to produce trailers that looked like large sparks.  Then I thought I was going to see a plane crash and then the light just disappeared.  I saw no sign of it nor could I locate it in the sky.  The only explanation  I could come up with was maybe a comet but it would seem that if it were we would have know about it before hand.  Have no idea what it might have been and have never seen anything like it.;44.3685000000002;-84.4291000000005
