PD));2007-06-19 22:40:00;30-60 seconds;2 bright lights over Dearborn Heights, MI Ford and Beechdaly rd area There were two bright lights in the sky in a line. Started out from the west and moved east, passed over the front of our yard, looked to be a mile up. Made no sounds and moved slowly. As they moved to the east several miles the lights went from bright white, toned down as a dim brown color and then went completely out within a second or two. These lights did not blink! like a typical aricraft, nor made any sound trail. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??  PD));42.3146619047619;-83.276726984127

3 or 4 bright orange orbs low in the sky that disappeared behind some trees.;2015-09-26 23:20:00;3 minutes;3 or 4 bright orange orbs low in the sky that disappeared behind some trees. I just got home from a family function and went to look at the full moon. I saw 3 or 4 bright orange orbs in the sky traveling slowly to the north west. They were pretty close in proximity but not in formation and were diverging from each other slightly then returning. They appeared to be separate and distinct entities with very fluid motion.  They appeared to be low in the sky and I lost them behind some trees. I have seen stars, satellites, planes, auroras, etc and this is the first object I have seen like this. I don't know what they were but UFO is actually foremost in my mind.;42.3146619047619;-83.276726984127
