Pulsating object observed over Michigan.;2017-09-13 20:30:00;1 hour +;Pulsating object observed over Michigan. I was in my back yard in the city of Dearborn Heights, Michigan, and observed a pulsating object in the sky.   I quickly started filming the object with my 4k video camera on a tripod.  The object appeared stationary, yet changed shape and color.   I managed to capture video and still images which were captured from the video itself.   Other people also reported seeing this object on social media.   I am a retired police pilot with a commercial rating.  I have never seen an aircraft with these characteristics. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness via telephone, and viewed the video he forwarded to NUFORC.  We suspect that what he was observing was a twinkling star, and given that he was looking to the west, the most likely candidate, we believe, is the star called, Arcturus.
