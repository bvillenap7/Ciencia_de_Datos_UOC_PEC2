2 star like ufos over dearborn heights moving east to west. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.  PD));2009-09-08 21:15:00;4 mins;2 star like ufos over dearborn heights moving east to west, before turning northeast. Myself and my wife saw 2 lights that looked like bright stars coming over from the west and then made a turn north east. the 2nd light was around a mile behind the first but both made the same turn, both the same size. No sound from them. The 2 lights must have crossed over metro Detroit air space. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.  PD));42.3146619047619;-83.276726984127
Weird light in the sky near Dearborn Heights, Mi.;2010-04-15 00:05:00;aprox. 10 min.;Weird light in the sky near Dearborn Heights, Mi. My brother and I were outside to have a cigarette tonight. I was half in an half out the door and kept stairing at a light that at first I thought was a reflection from the glass.  I laughed and said look bro it looks like a UFO, he was standing all the way outside and said what the heck I stepped completely out and it deffinetly was not a reflection but a bright yellowish/white light going back and forth behind some trees.  We thought it maybe was a plane but planes dont move like that we walked out to the middle of the street to get a better look and it quickly vanished.  I dont know what the heck it could have been but it scared the crap out of both of us and if anyone knows maybe what it was and could fill us in that would be cool.
