Slow moving (neon light  tube) shaped object;2001-07-26 20:15:00;2-3min;Slow moving (neon light  tube) shaped object On 7-26-2001 at approximately 8:15P.M. I was standing in my backyard when I observed a glowing white object approaching from the west and traveling east.  I thought at first that it was a plane as I live near Metro Airport.  As the object got closer I could see that it was not a plane.  It reminded me of a long neon light tube and glowed in the same manner.  This was not reflected light.  It moved in a straight line from west to east at a slow steady pace.  There was no sound and it seemed to be at a much greater altitude than the planes that fly overhead.  By the time I ran into the house to get my camcorder it had disappeared from sight.  This object was midway between the horizon and overhead as I faced in a southerly direction.  Skies were clear blue and it was still daylight, a few whispy clouds.  I am no longer a skeptic.;42.3146619047619;-83.276726984127
