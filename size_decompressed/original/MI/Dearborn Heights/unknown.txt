Bright orange lights on craft over Dearborn Hts. MI;2009-07-04 21:30:00;30 seconds;Bright orange lights on craft over Dearborn Hts. MI Me, my husband, and my neighbors (two adults and two children) were watching another neighbor blow off fireworks at the baseball diamond in a nearby school. Far off in the distance, there were other fireworks. I noticed a bright orange color (the color of fire), seemed to be square in shape. At first I thought it was a firework, but it kept going higher and higher and did not explode nor did the color fade. My neighbor's son said what is that? and it was quickly overhead. It was cloudy and the object was very high in the sky, however I could make out a circle pattern on the bottom of the object. I could not tell the shape. When the object was overhead, it was no longer bright orange but seemed to be almost the color and texture of a cloud. The circle pattern on the bottom seemed a soft pinkish red color. It continued on its path and was out of eyesight within seconds.;42.3146619047619;-83.276726984127
MI ufo with red and black flashing lights.;2015-06-21 11:10:00;5 minutes;MI ufo with red and black flashing lights On 6/21/2015, at about 11:10pm, in the western sky, an entity slowly came into view from further west.  Only the lights were visible, which were 2 red, 1 green, and 2 neon purple (more like blacklights) lights all intermittently flashing, as it stopped just to the lower left of the moon.   You could hear no sound from it.   After about 3 or 4 minutes, it literally disappeared, as if it just turned all of its lights off at once.
