Two orange balls silently fly over Michigan from south to north.;2020-09-26 21:36:00;8 minutes;Two orange balls silently fly over Michigan from south to north. We saw 2 objects fly at different times from the south to the north making no sound.  First was at 9:36 pm.  2nd was at 9:44.  Both looked like orange balls.  The 2nd had a piece shoot off and disappear.  Seen by 4 adults and 2 children sitting around a campfire by our lake.  All sober.  I have video but it doesnâ€™t show up very well.;43.4587;-85.9672999999999
