I was on a bus when I looked out the window and saw a bright flashig circle in the sky. I told my brother to look at it and he was amazed. Then my two friends saw it and they too were amazed. It was flying back and forth over a wheat field. There were some clouds that night. It was a yellow white light. It was raining a little. It was very cold. ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.
