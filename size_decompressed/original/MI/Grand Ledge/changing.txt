very large unusual orange light and shape..dissapated very rapidly;2006-03-04 12:40:00;20-45 seconds;very large unusual orange light and shape..dissapated very rapidly I went outside to smoke about 12:40 a.m. this date. and saw a strange light in the sky to my w. nw.  a very big crescent shapped orange light. It lasted a very few seconds... maybe 30....I new at the speed it was moving I would not have time to get my wife to see it before it was gone.It seemed to have turned sideways as it went up than just dissappeard in to a pin point of light, I have no Idea the size of the source of light, as I heard or smelled nothing, just by looking at the clear sky around I could only assume it was huge.. I have to admit... after being a volunteer fireman for almost 18 years and being married to a cop for almost 20....there's not much I havent seen or heard....I have never seen this.;42.7502;-84.7388
