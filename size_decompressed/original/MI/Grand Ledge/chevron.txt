v shaped object over Grand Ledge, MI;2020-11-24 05:00:00;5 seconds;v shaped object over Grand Ledge, MI About 5am on 11/24/20 I saw a huge v shape object fly over I-96 in the Grand Ledge, MI area. It traveled slowly from west to east and had around 6-7 white lights and one red light on it.  The red light and one white light were blinking. Both the blinking lights were toward the center of the object. I heard nothing from the object but my loud truck probably would have kept me from hearing it anyway.  The object was skinny towards the tips of the v and fat at the center (or point). None of the other vehicles traveling around me seem to slow down or take notice. The bottom of the object was lit up due to the parking lot lights of the flying J truckstop and loves truckstop;42.7502;-84.7388
