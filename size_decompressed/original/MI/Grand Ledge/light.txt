light traveling at high speed North to South-West;2000-10-31 19:00:00;:20 -:30 sec.;light traveling at high speed North to South-West We observed a light traveling at high speed in the direction of North to South-West. It started higher in the sky and got closer to the horizon but went out of sight before it hit the horizon. We did not observe any sort of tail on it. At first we thought it might be an airplane but it moved to fast and it only had a single light on it. The light also traveled a pattern I don't think is consistant with airplane since it didn't describe an arc.;42.7502;-84.7388
