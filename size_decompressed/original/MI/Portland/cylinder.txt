But the North Start doesn't set in the west and I ws travelling west. Suspecting something strange I pulled over to the shoulder and got out my video camera (which I had in the car because I had taken my daughter on a field trip the Friday before).  When I first looked up at it with the camer it was a ball of light that was playing games with me.  when I firt starting filming it was constantly moving and shaking in and out of the camera view.  When I zoomed in on it it would move out of my camera sight...so I would have to go back to normal to have it come back into view.  After about 10 minutes it began to play with me....coming up close to my camera then dancing around and then going back high up into the sky.  Also, when traffic would come down the road it would stop playing with me and sit high up in the sky.  Every once in a while there were spurts of static on my camera outof no where.  I spent about 20 minutes filming (until my battery died - funny thing about it is when I began filming I had 43 minutes of battery life left).  The last thing it did was come extremely close to the camera so I could see it large and in person and then the camera died and it flew back into the sky.;42.8621;-84.9161
