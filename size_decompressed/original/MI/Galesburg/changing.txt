I viewed a 'fireball' change into an aircraft;2011-07-25 21:00:00;1 minute;I viewed a 'fireball' change into an aircraft Driving Westward, I noticed a stationary orange/amber fireball in a patch of sky WSW. Its angle of elevation was 55-60 degrees.  It remained there for about 10 seconds. In the next 5-10 seconds that followed, the object smoothly dropped very low to the ground, moved slightly NE (10-15 degrees N) and was now hovering directly above the road ahead. It dropped so low, I thought the object might land.  I estimate it's new angle of elevation was 15-20 degrees.  After dropping its altitude, I estimate the aircraft was hovering no higher than 100 yds. Gradually, during its descent, the object lost all of it's amber/orange glow and a small, triangular, flat black/primer colored aircraft became visible. The aircraft hovered above the road long enough for me to drive almost directly under it. I was extremely close to the aircraft, it was due South, and at one point was almost at my zenith. I had to maneuver my head out of the window to have a look. The aircraft didn't have registration lettering, wings, a tail, propellers, cylindrical shapes, or navigation lights. The aircraft was roughly shaped like a diamond, with a slightly elongated section facing West. There was a convex shape on the top of the craft, almost resembling a cock pit. The aircraft was virtually silent. I rolled down my window to have a listen and only heard the passing air. I viewed the aircraft at this distance for about 15-20 seconds before passing it by. I almost immediately looked back and looked in my rear view mirrors, but saw nothing. I reported this sighting to my local county sheriff's office as well as the FAA. It may be worth mentioning there's a military base about 15 miles away, in a neighboring town. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.2985;-85.4217
