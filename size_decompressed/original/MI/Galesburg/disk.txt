Huge circle of rectangular light beams shoot into the night sky on highway 94;1974-04-20 02:15:00;5 minutes;Huge circle of rectangular light beams shoot into the night sky on highway 94 Entering this report as it may have some bearing for researchers.  My three companions and I were traveling from Battle Creek to Galesburg at around 2:15 am on highyway 94.  The night was damp and foggy.  Ahead, we noticed bright beams of blue white light streaming into the sky in random, puslsating fashion, and an angle of about 60 degrees, right up from the ground.  The beams lit the cloud base, and from a distance, they created a wedge shape of beams.  As we got closer, these beams were observed to be very large, as large or larger than a searchlight beam.  They formed a circular pattern on the cloud base.  We slowed down and stopped the van opposite the lights on the berm of the highway.  We sat there for a minute, watching the rectanglar beams pulse upward in random patterns.  We figured there was a car lot or welding shop down there, as they came from below the highway and behind trees.  The number of them, however, and the late hour, convinced us that this could not be search lights.  The area they eminated from was about the size of a ranch home.  I decided to cross the freeway and take a look, and we all opened the doors and got out.  When I closed the door, the lights went out!  We stood there in total darkness for a second and then piled back into the van an got out of there in a hurry. The next day, remembering a mile marker that was close, we returned and found a pond below the trees where the lights had been.  A week later, a Cleveland Plain Dealer artist drew a sketch of a UFO she had seen hovering above her back yard.  She claimed it had thrown bright, blue white beams of light through rectangular windows around its edge.  Her drawing would have corresponded to what we saw that night.;42.2985;-85.4217
