At about 11:00 pm on july 3, 2010, my family and i were coming home from watching fireworks.  We live in the country and the sky was quite clear.   My dad noticed two bright objects above our vehicle and asked everyone else in the vehicle what they were.  I turned the vehicle around to try and get a better look.  At this time ( driving north)  the two lights took off  farther ahead of us and about 2 - 3 hundred yard up.   The two lights were reddish orange and flew through the sky at the same distance of each other.   After following the lights for about 5 - 10 minutes the first bright light completely stopped.  The second light caught up to the first one and they joined together.   The one light started flying east and higher in the sky.   After they joined and started moving, the light completely disappeared.  There were five adults who witnessed this in the vehicle.   The next day I talked to other people in area and others did see this too, but could not explain either.;43.236;-85.7351
