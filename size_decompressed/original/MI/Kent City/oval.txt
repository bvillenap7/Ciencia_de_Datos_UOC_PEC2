White, pulsating oval shaped unidentified craft.;2005-09-03 12:45:00;4 minutes;White, pulsating oval shaped unidentified craft. I am a former Airman from the United States Air Force, I am 27 years old, I live in Kent City, Michigan.  At 12:45 PM I was outside and I looked almost straight up and saw a white oval shaped unidentified craft moving from northeast to southwest. I saw it expand and contract slightly a few times. It was moving about as fast as a commercial airliner as far as I could tell, maybe a little faster. I could tell it was about as high as the clouds because it seemed to pass through a couple. There was no contrail, and no sound. Also from the istance that i estimated it to be from me, it must have been about the same length as a commercial airliner, maybe more, and also it looked maybe 30% to 50% wider. As I was watching it in clear view it suddenly dissapeared. I watched cover about 40% of the sky. The sighting lasted about a total of 4 minutes.;43.236;-85.7351
