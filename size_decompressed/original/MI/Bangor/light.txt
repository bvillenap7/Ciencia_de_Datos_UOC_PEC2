Single very bright pulsing light, like a very low star, hovering above tree lines appearing to be several miles S/SE.  ((Venus??));2020-03-18 00:00:00;Hours;Single very bright pulsing light, like a very low star, hovering above tree lines appearing to be several miles S/SE away from my home.  It was moving in a very tight location for over an hour, I observed this for over 40 minutes before going inside to cook.  When i went outside to see if the light was still hanging around it was no longer there.  There were no stars near this light and it is not the first time I have observed them in this area. February 3rd or 4th my girlfriend and I witnessed a lot of activity.  Lights circling unknown objects, lights dancing back and fourth, vertical then horizontal.  Direction seems meaningless to these lights.  I refer to them as dancing stars.  I have so far shown 2 family members to confirm these dancing lights.  I live on the country side.;42.3276;-86.1292
