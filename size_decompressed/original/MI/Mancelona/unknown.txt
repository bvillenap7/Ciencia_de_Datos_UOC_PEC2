Strange objects blinking red and white and moveing in weird directions.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling stars, we suspect.  PD));2012-08-29 00:00:00;most nights;Strange objects blinking red and white and moveing in weird directions. Ive noticed on clear nights when the stars are clearly visable a couple of what apear at first to be stars. At a closer look i can see objects in the sky blinking red and white. (a different number of object every night, always more than one.)  At first i thought they might be planes or mabey even hellocopters, but they move back and forth and all kinds of ways that are impossable for them to do. The past couple of nights there have been at least nine.  Some of them will get closer to the earth then get farther, they will move slowly then suddenly move faster changing speed.  They will apear to be going backwords then suddenly forwords, witch i am alost 100% sure human crafts can't do.  A couple of times i seen what apeared to be a shooting star.  I'm not to sure what these obects are but i do know that it is really weird and im suprised noone else has noticed them. but how many peaple really spend time looking in the night sky.  I am not giving my na! me or contact info due to the fact that i am a very untrusting person. I advise this be at least checked into!!
