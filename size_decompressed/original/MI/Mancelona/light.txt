My oldest daughter (17) noticed some &quotplanes flying&quot really fast. She then n My family and I were sitting around our bonfire. My oldest daughter (17) noticed some planes flying really fast. She then noted that the lights were flying too fast to be planes and they were not flashing or colored in any way. They looked exactly like stars, really far away and they flew very fast. The stars were flying equal distance apart. They all seemed to be coming from a southwest area, heading northeast. We live on the 45th parallel in Michigan so halfway between the equator and north pole. We saw at least 50 of these lights. At first they seemed to be moving all in a straight line coming from the same place. Then we noticed that there were other lines coming from different areas but all seemed to be headed towards the same destination. At one point we saw one that got brighter and dimmed instantly like a dimmer switch, as it was passing the north star. We recorded a video.;44.9118000000007;-85.0638000000014
