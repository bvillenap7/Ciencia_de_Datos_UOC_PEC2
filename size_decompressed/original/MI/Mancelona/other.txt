At 8:10 pm on November 15 2001 my husband and I saw a ufo.It was a bell shape. Cylinder top with saucer like bottom.It had three red lights on it in the shape of a triangle.It glowed a reddish with a little whitish light.It had some time of a grill around its middle.It moved very slowly to the left as it was faced towards us.There were two other normal aircraft following it.We saw it for about eight minutes before it went out of our sight behind the trees.We took 3 pictures but they didnt turn out very well.You can barely see its outline but you can see it if you look carefully.This is our first time we have seen anything out of the ordinary.;44.9118000000007;-85.0638000000014
