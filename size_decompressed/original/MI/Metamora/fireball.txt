Orange glowing orb around 3 minutes just above western horizon around 11:00 in the thumb area of Michigan.;2012-07-23 11:00:00;4 minutes;Orange glowing orb around 3 minutes just above western horizon around 11:00 in the thumb area of Michigan. We were on the deck facing west. We are up on a hill so we can see for miles. Suddenely just above the horizon we see a orange/red orb but not in a complete circle. My son thought it was an asteroid but it just stayed there changing from light color to bright colors and then fizzeled out. It was like a firework where it starts off not very clear and then it became very clear and then it slowing dissapeared.  This took about 3 minutes so we knew it was not a firework.  The next day around 10:00 a.m. I see what I believe to be a  military helicopter circleing around the area we seen the light. This was way off in the west so I could not make out the helicopter but it sounded like a military one with the heavy blade sound. We do not have military in our area.  So for now I'll just keep checking the net to see if anyone else saw what we say. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.9405;-83.2978
