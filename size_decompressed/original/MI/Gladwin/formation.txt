Line of three bright lights witnessed by 4.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD));2019-05-26 23:45:00;3 min;Line of three bright lights witnessed by 4 Straight line of three bright lights solid.  Almost seemed connected, if looking closely they all seemed connected by a thin white line.  Did not follow what seemed to be a natural orbit compared to the visible satellites the sky at the time.  The lights moved from the west to northeast at great speed.  The best way to compare this would be to say it looked like orions belt moving quickly across the sky. Experience recorded by cellular device but lights are not visible but audio reactions audible. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD));44.0325;-84.5005000000001
