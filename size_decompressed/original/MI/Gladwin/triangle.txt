My friend and had just stepped out in his driveway to look at what had suddenly become a beautiful, clear, starlit sky.   We had seen two satellites and three shooting stars and were scanning the sky to the west, when about 1/3rd of the way between the horizon and directly overhead, towards WSW, a bright white light suddenly appeared, grew in brightness and size while stationary over the course of 5-10 seconds, flared briefly and with a small trail behind it, began to speed off to the WNW, not extremely fast, but faster than an jet aircraft at that height would haveâ€¦  The trail lasted only a second or two, and it turned into a bright dot that faded as it headed away, we watched it for 20-30 seconds as it faded out.   Dogs across the street started barking at the same time and continued to do so for several minutes after the event.;44.0325;-84.5005000000001
