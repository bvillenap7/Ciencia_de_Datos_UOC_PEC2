Fireball flew overhead on the 4th of July;2010-07-04 21:30:00;10 secs;Fireball flew overhead on the 4th of July While sitting and waiting for the fireworks to start on the fourth of July, myself, my friend, and my 10 yr old son saw right above us, what looked like a fireball flying over us.  We all just sat there and looked at it and didn't think alot of it, because we just assumed it was some new firework thing that someone had.  It was pretty  high up, and traveled at a medium speed overhead.  I took pictures of it, but they just kind of look like a light to me.  I was very puzzled about it all night.;41.9266;-84.6237000000001
