Hovering/moving white or metallic ball in the sky;2010-10-12 16:00:00;1-2 minutes;Hovering/moving white or metallic ball in the sky I was coming out of the store and putting my son in his car seat, when something in the sky caught my eye due to it reflecting the sun.  I looked up in the South/East sky and saw something.  At first I assumed it was an airplane, but it was definitely not.  I appeared to be metallic color at times, and then at times it looked like it was white...like a little white solid ball in the sky.  It moved very slowly left and then seemed to stop, and then moved a little more.  I continued watching it for approximately 1-2 minutes. I had never taken a picture with my phone, so I looked down for a second to see how to do it, and looked back up, and it was gone.  I did not see it exit the area.   I looked and looked for it, but it was not there anymore.  I went home and told my friends what I'd seen and none of them believed me, of course.  Then today when I logged onto the computer, I saw something on Yahoo! entitled Manhatten UFO's, and watched the video of what was over New York the very next day, I KNEW that is exactly what I'd seen.   Only I saw only one of them...not many.  It looked exactly like the video that was taken on 10/13/10 in Manhatten.  I am absolutely sure that is what I saw.;41.9266;-84.6237000000001
