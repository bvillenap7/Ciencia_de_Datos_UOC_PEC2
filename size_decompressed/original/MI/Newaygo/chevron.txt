Large silent sighting in the woods of mid Michigan hovers and disappears.;1995-08-13 11:00:00;30-45 seconds;Large silent sighting in the woods of mid Michigan hovers and disappears. I apologize for the range of time and dates but this happened many years ago.  Sometime between late July and early September in 1995 in Newaygo, Mi.  I was sitting outside this store (next to the flea market building) on M-37 after using the pay phone something got my attention. As I looked SE or towards Grand Rapids, a large aircraft rose from the woods just set back of the store. It was gone as quick as it rose.  It made no noise and I stood there stunned and quickly turned to see if anyone else saw what I just saw.  No one!  I just told myself there must by a military base nearby but I just can't shake it's massive size and lack of sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));43.4178;-85.7601
