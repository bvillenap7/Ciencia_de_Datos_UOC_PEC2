Appeared to be 3 pulsating blue/green lights in a tight triangle. Object appreared to be stationary at first, but was actually moving in a swaying circular style random patterns. At one point the lights dimmed and disappeared and seemed to streak at an angle toward the ground (similar to a shooting star). Object reappeared just seconds later in the same area (all this at an estimated 2-3 mile range). My wife and I observed this for about 10 minutes. I came back out on a few occasions over the next hour or so and object was still there, althought in not the same spot. Also it appeared that possibly there were 2 more of these objects further off in the distance, but were too far away to to tell for sure. On a few occasions I heard what were jets in the distance, and also seen the blinking lights of a couple different airplaines in the immediate area. This object was in the area for so long that I totally expected to hear other reports (news/people) that they had seen the same thing. This however was spotted in a very rural area.;43.4178;-85.7601
