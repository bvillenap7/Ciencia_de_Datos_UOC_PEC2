I did not see a tail sticking up in the back of it. It was heading west, about the speed of an  airplane.  It entered a small white cloud, I was waiting to see it come out the other side of this cloud. It never did.  The cloud was around 6 times the length of the craft.  All blue sky around this cloud.  I kept watching, cause it seemed to vanish. Well, at that point I just stood out side waiting for it. Their is no way it could of made a turn behind it.  Then in a matter of two minutes that cloud fadded out.  I watched to see if anyother clouds would fade away.  Nope, just that one.  I wonder now if some kind of heat from the UFO (I dont know what it was) did that to the cloud.  This was a cloud you could not see through at the start.   You got me on what happend.  This took place in less then 5 minutes.   I just had to report this here.  Well, you tell me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
