I was loading the car to go to Grand Rapids to see my mother inlaw, when I opened the trunck I turned and happend to look in the sky because it was such a bright and sunny day. I saw in the sky two round disks white in color with smokelike clouds around it and flying very jerky movements. they were making 90 degrees turns like chaseing each other. When one of them turned, I saw the sun reflect off the disk. then just like that they were out of sight. All of this lasted for about 30-40 seconds. I am retired 62 year old Real estate Broker and live in a trailer park in Newaygo County, Michigan. I have seen something like this once before about two yrs earler. At that time it was bright and sunny and I was at a flea market and I seen this white ball crossing the sky ,ther was no sound and it was out of site in 10 seconds heading south to north. The flea market was in Six Lakes area. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the date of the alleged sighting was in the year 2003.  We have altered the date above to 2003.  PD));43.4178;-85.7601
