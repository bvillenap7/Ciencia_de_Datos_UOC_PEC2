Low to the ground (just over trees) flying black triangle with white lights around its sides.  No sound. ((anonymous report));2018-03-18 01:47:00;8 seconds;Low to the ground ( just over trees)  flying black triangle with white lights around it's sides. No sound. Moved like a fish in water. Just got home from a night of bowling (no drinking so totally sober), and as we were getting out of the van, I just so happened to look up at what I thought was a shooting star. When I realized the shooting star was much closer than I originally thought and was moving toward us I yelled to my son WHAT THE HECK IS THAT???.  He then looked up and and saw it.  We were so freaked out we continued to yell to each other WHAT THE HECK????? WHAT IS THAT!!!!..  it seemed to slow down as it got closer to us .. almost like it acknowledged that we had noticed it..  then within just a few short seconds, it took off like a fish in water type movement it was totally unnatural looking how it moved.  Was just over the tree line, it seemed and about the size of one of those big green signs you see on express way overpasses..   when it was directly over our heads we could make out the shape.. it was FLAT OUT a Triangle shaped object with a triangle shape white light around the outer edges..  it made NO sound at all..  Dead silent.  The stars and clear sky that night made it so that we could see the shape of it once it was directly over our heads with no problem.  Scared the crap out of us..  still trying to explain it away but just can't.  What the heck was it???????   I know what drones are and what they look and perform like... this was no drone in my opinion. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
