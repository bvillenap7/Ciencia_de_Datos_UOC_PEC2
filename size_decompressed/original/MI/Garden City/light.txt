Stars or lights apparently joining up in the sky.;1970-07-15 23:00:00;Few minutes;Stars or lights apparently joining up in the sky. I read something by Grant Cameron, and he suggests reporting and documenting all sightings.  I have often thought about this and now I would like to share it. I graduated from high school June 10 1970.  It was a few days later, or maybe a week or two, it's been a long time now.  We lived in Garden City Michigan.  We often slept outside, and we always had our sleeping bags ready to go. In our neighborhood in Garden City we all had big back yards, lots of trees, and it was really like sleeping in the woods.  It was a dry clear night, and we laid out in our sleeping bags.  We talked a lot and were both staring up at the stars, when we both noticed something unusual at a star right straight above us. The star or light would have other lights going up to it, and then leave it.  Its been a long time, but I believe we saw at least 4 stars or lights joining up with it, then departing.  I cant recall if the activity ceased, or if we just fell asleep.  I think I might have compared it to a gas station, or a drive in restaurant.  We both saw it at the same time and always wondered what it could have been. Now hearing all the declassified info about the spy satellites  (Hexagon) and others I wonder if this is what we both saw that night.

Saw a light, like a star, move slowly towards NNW, stopping and changing direction.;2016-04-02 21:45:00;15 minutes;Saw a light, like a star, move slowly towards NNW, stopping and changing direction. My friend and I were taking the dog outside, and we were talking about work.  I was looking upbat the stars, because it was so clear out (a few clouds but overall more stars than usual).  I saw a star move, and thought it was maybe a little plane, but it would move to the north-northwest, stop for a moment, change direction, stop and move again.  We watched the light for about 15 minutes before it blinked out.;42.3315;-83.3425
Slow moving star.;2016-07-27 05:30:00;20 seconds;Slow moving star appeared to be inside our atmosphere.  Heading south.  No blinking lights, no sound, too slow for earth aircraft.;42.3315;-83.3425

Synchronized flow, repetitive for at least 20 minutes high in the sky. Eventually disappearing into the atmosphere one by one in order.;42.3315;-83.3425
