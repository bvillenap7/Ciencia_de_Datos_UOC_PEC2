flashing lights saucer flying away;2006-12-18 07:22:00;2 minutes;flashing lights saucer flying away Last night me and my friend were walking home down merriman road and i look up and over to the left and i see flashes of light that looked like lightning flashes but there was no bolt or sound of thunder just flashes. I only saw the first one then like 30 seconds later i see another flash and the duration was longer this time my friend saw it too. We turn down my street walk for about another 30 seconds look up to the right and we see the object fly away.  Today at school i tell my friends at lunch and one of them said they saw the same thing and before i tell him when we saw it he says around 7:00.  Then I tell someone else later on that day about it and he told me some girl in his 4th hour was talking about it too but she said she saw green lights.;42.3315;-83.3425
