Update: UFO over Garden City (5829 Harrison Rd) in 1983 (Approx);1983-06-15 23:00:00;4 minutes;Update: UFO over Garden City (5829 Harrison Rd) in 1983 (Approx) UPDATE: I would like to be contacted by the other person who witnessed a UFO in Garden City in the early 1980s.  It sounds like we saw the same craft. I was the person who filed a report regarding a UFO sighting in Garden City on 6/15/1983. My original UFO report was filed  2003. I was reading through the report and noticed that another person posted a UFO sighting in the Early 1980s on this site as well. I would like for the person who witnessed the sighting in the early 1980s to contact me via email -----------((address deleted))  Also, I have included the exact address where the sighting occurred in 1983. The date of 1983 is only approximate and the sighting could have occurred in 1982, 1983 or 1984.  I believe that I was 8 years old when this occurred. The only other living person who witnessed the craft is my mother. She still remembers all of the details (Probably better than me.)  Sighting occurred at  ((number deleted)) Harrison St, Garden City, Mi. Year - Approx 1983  BTW, I do not believe that this craft was human made. The object took off and left area at a speed MUCH greater that a fighter jet traveling above the speed of sound. The craft did not emit any sound and there was no vapor trail. The only visible trail would have been the light tracer trails that it left when it flew out of sight in a blink of an eye. The same kind of tracer that you see when you spin a sparkler around during the fourth of July. I look forward to hearing from the person who also witnessed this craft. Also, a UFO investigator may contact me as well if needed. Thank You,  Roger ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.3315;-83.3425
2 orange circular objects near Detroit, Michigan.;2015-09-19 22:30:00;2 minutes;2 orange circular objects near Detroit, Michigan. Today, 9-19-2015, at about 22:30, driving home, I witnessed two orange circular objects flying in formation from west to east while driving west just southwest of my location.   I pulled my vehicle over and began to record video with my cell phone.  The two objects continued to travel east toward Detroit.   When I got out of my car before starting to record again the trailing object spead off at unthinkable speed then the second object disappeared 5 seconds later.   Neither light blinked allowing me to believe it was not an airplane.   Both lights where to far apart to be lights on wings but to close and level to be two separate airplanes and traveling to fast to be helicopters.;42.3315;-83.3425
