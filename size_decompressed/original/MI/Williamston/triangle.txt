Three stars making up an equilateral triangle move quickly and silently across the night sky before disappearing. ((anon. report));2016-04-10 23:00:00;2-3 seconds;Three stars making up an equilateral triangle move quickly and silently across the night sky before disappearing. I was lying on the roof of one of the buildings in my hometown with two of my close buddies after a night of hanging out.  The building was three stories high and we climbed up there to look at the stars and talk about guy stuff.  It was an unusually warm April night so we decided to stay out late and relax a little and enjoy the night. I was the only one who actually saw the craft, as I was the first one up on the roof and subsequently the first one to lie down and look up.  It was an extremely clear night and as I laid their waiting for my buddies to catch up I noticed three stars making out a perfect triangle.  At first I thought nothing of it as my eyes adjusted to the enormous amount of stars in front of me, but suddenly (and silently) all three stars making up the triangle began to move at an accelerated pace. My first reaction was “wow, that plane is flying really low.”  But I immediately realized it was making no sound and there was absolutely no way this was an airplane.  Within the span of no more than four second, the three starts making up the perfect equilateral triangle had moved from the eastern half of the night sky, directly over me, and then into the western half, vanishing simultaneously before ever reaching the western horizon. Over the span of four seconds, three stars, equidistant apart, moved across the entire night sky simultaneously before disappearing instantaneously into the night sky.  I have no idea what I witnessed, and weeks later I am still baffled by what I saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.6986;-84.2902
