I was taking my dog outside before bed and looked up in the sky and saw to large orange/red orbs moving very slowly across the sky.  I have very tall trees around house and they were not much higher than those .  They made no sound and for a moment I thought could they be fireworks but no they moved steadily across the sky from a westerly direction.  After a time the second one just disappeared --I thought maybe it had gone behind a cloud but it did not reappear.  The first one continued right above my house and appeared to hover and then seemed to turn or go off in a different direction. I watched until it became small and went outof sight.;42.6986;-84.2902
