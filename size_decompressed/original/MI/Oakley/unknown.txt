Two lights.;2014-04-27 23:00:00;2-3 minutes;I went outside because I seen two bright lights very low (just above the tree line).  I thought it was a low flying passenger jet getting ready to land or crash. It was moving very slow.  I was afraid that it was going to crash into the house.  The two lights were spread apart about the width of a passenger jet wing span.  There were no other visible lights on the aircraft.  When it was directly above me it sounded like a jet but it was very quiet (especially since it was so low).  My wife was in the bedroom and heard nothing.  I was on the phone explaining what I saw and to my niece and she said that she heard it.  When it was directly above me I looked up at the bottom.  It appeared to be whitish color with no markings. It was much wider than a underbelly of a plane.  My original thought was that it was some sort of military transport flying low to avoid radar.  Then I realized that there were no other light on it.  The two lights looked to be giant spot lights and they seemed to move as if it were searching for something.  I cannot explain what it was.  Once it went over the house I ran to the other side of the house to look out a window and it was nowhere to be seen.  I then rushed outside to look but it was gone.  Addendum:  The size of the aircraft approximately 20 moons across from light to light.  The size of the bottom appeared to be about three of my fist on my out stretched arm. It was moving south to north and made a slight oblique move to the west.  The sighting was just east of Oakley. The craft flew over the Shiawassee river towards me.  The time was between 22:10 hrs and 23:00 hrs.;43.1539;-84.2125
