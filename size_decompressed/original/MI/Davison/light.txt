It was flying in a straight line parallell to the triangles longest side.  We then saw another bright moving star heading south.  It flashed liked a camera then disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  The three objects flying in triangular formation may have been what are thought to be U. S. Navy NOSS satellites.;43.0351999999995;-83.5247999999994
A red blinking craft hovers across the road in Davison Michigan;2006-07-14 05:15:00;seconds;A red blinking craft hovers across the road in Davison Michigan My boyfriend and I were driving (westbound) down Davison Road shortly after 5am. Up ahead, an object hovered across the road in a diagonal fashion. Though I was tired I knew right away that it was NOT a car, as there were no crossroads where it came and went, just straight road. The object was slightly off the ground, and it was slowly rotating, displaying red blinking lights. It happened so quick I wondered if I was seeing things, but my boyfriend, who was wide awake and driving looked right back at me when i looked at him in awe. We both just knew it was nothing man made...when we passed the spot it had crossed, of course there was nothing to be seen there! We turned right at the next road (northbound)and low and behold all the way down at the end of the road we saw a blinking flash of red and then nothing. We are still in awe. I cannot believe that no one else saw this thing...Just now I read a report from MY SAME TOWN and that reporters statement sounds remarkably closs to what we saw!;43.0351999999995;-83.5247999999994
Lights spotted over Port Huron/Lapeer MI.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet, we suspect.  PD));2009-06-29 04:15:00;1 hr from first spotting;Lights spotted over Port Huron/Lapeer MI On the morning of June 29th at 4:15 am a very bright light was spotted from Davison, Mi to the east between 85 and 90 degrees and between 35 and 40 degrees in elevation. The light remained in this position until it disappeared at 5:15. Light consisted of multiple lights in 3 rows, with 10-12 lights in a row in a bar like shape. Lights varied between being on and off, in color, intensity. They varied from glowing to being beams of light extending 5 times the width of the object. The lights seemed to rotate at times and sit still at other times, and sometimes flash at random. A red beam was often seen shining from the bottom of the object. 6-10 audible tones were heard while the object was visible. Tones were heard about every 15 minutes and lasted only a few seconds. The object seemed to move slightly in reference to nearby stars every few minutes but still remained in nearly the same place. A low hum was maintained at all times during the sighting but this could possibly have been local road noise. ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet, we suspect.  PD));43.0351999999995;-83.5247999999994
