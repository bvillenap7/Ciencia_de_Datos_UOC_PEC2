A black circle appears on helmet cam footage.;2007-01-28 13:00:00;9:59;A black circle appears on helmet cam footage. January 28th, 2007, Davison, Mi.  I attended an Airsoft game with a new Oregon Scientific ATC-2000 helmet cam strapped to my helmet. It was unknowingly pointed in a slight upward direction.  During the game, I didn't see or hear anything out of the ordinary. It was a typical day of Airsofting for me. A good time, although a tad bit cold.  After about a six hour game, I proceeded to head home and watch the firefight footage I got during the day. As I began watching the roughly 20 minutes of video that I shot, I found myself slightly disappointed in the video as my cam was pointed a tad higher than I'd thought.  However, in one of the clips, a black circle had been filmed in the middle of the open sky. It couldn't have been anything on the lens as it moved off screen when I turned my head and reappeared as I turned back. It did this for several minutes in the video as well as changing size. At one point, it fades off screen only to reappear and seemingly move off at high speed. It could have been me turning my head too fast, I don't know.  I'm not quite sure what it is, whether it be an actual UFO or not, but I showed 5 different people and asked their opinions. They couldn't explain it either.  I'm not a believer of UFO's or Ghosts or anything else. I just happen to have something strange that I can't explain on video.  I'll burn it to DVD and send it out. The file is over 300mb's so I can't email it.;43.0351999999995;-83.5247999999994
