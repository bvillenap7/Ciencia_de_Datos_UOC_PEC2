My wife and I were about to retire for the day.  Being up late, we were just about to turn off our computer, when an extremely bright flash lit up our entire bedroom.   Mini blinds were closed, but this light source was like there was a beam of light outside our home and permeated the room.  It was gone as suddenly as it appeared, taking us by surprise.  This event also happened in months previously.  It certainly makes you afraid to look out the window to investigate its source.;43.0351999999995;-83.5247999999994
