We were sitting at a bon fire I got up to go to the bathroom. I was looking up into the sky and I noticed a lite out of the corner of my eye. The light wasn't moving it was just sitting in the woods. I thought it was just another house. Then it flickered bright lights at even intervals. I called to my other two friends and to show them what was in the woods.  The owner of the farm said that their wasn't another house for about 3 miles. We decided to check it out. The lights were about 300 yards away.  We walked for a while as we got to 100 yards the lights started to flicker at different intervals. Some red flashes came about every 15 seconds.  As we got closer we could see that it was some sort of object. It was Long and cigar shaped it looked as if it was made out of stainless steel. Their were no markings or windows. there wasn't even any noise.As we got within 50 yards it started to move forward. As we followed it the object started to raise up into the air as it hit the top of the tree line the lights shut off. It still had a faint luminus glow. Then it accelerated beyond our view in a southwest direction.;43.0351999999995;-83.5247999999994
