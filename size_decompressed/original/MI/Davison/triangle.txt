I was sitting on my back porch with my dog, when I noticed a huge boomerang-shaped object flying from south to north at what appeared to be an incredible speed.  There was no noise or wind, it just passed over us.  It passed through some clouds and re-emerged as it passed over head.  I got up and ran to the side of my home and watched as disappeared into the night sky. The object had no lights, no sound, was a dull grey color and shaped like a huge boomerang if I had guess as to the objects size-maybe as long as an aircraft carrier.  I watch the international space station fly over all the time this was much closer to the Earth and moved at least five times faster.  It was not bright like the space station.  I saw it from the ground looking up, so I have no idea how tall it was, but it was wider than my house-much wider. I do not expect anyone to believe me, because other than seeing lights moving through the night sky like the international space station.  I’ve never seen anything this big, or so low, so I’ve never believed any of the reports of flying saucers.  I am wondering though, if anyone else saw what I saw on 6/7/12 at around 11 pm EST. in Michigan heading in a northerly direction?   Thank You for your time.;43.0351999999995;-83.5247999999994
