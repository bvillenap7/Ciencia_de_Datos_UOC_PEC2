3 orange/red spheres traveling at casual pace, spaced evenly apart until disappearing one by one.;2014-05-10 22:00:00;4 minutes;3 orange/red spheres traveling at casual pace, spaced evenly apart until disappearing one by one Standing in my driveway I noticed an orange/red sphere moving across the sky, assuming an airplane.  However, it was traveling from right to left, which is not the usual flight pattern, & it was silent. Then another sphere, exactly the same size, color, & shape appeared, traveling in the same direction & at the same speed. A 3rd sphere appeared, following the same pattern. I called my wife out to take a look & she watched as the 3 spheres crossed the sky at a casual pace, staying the same distance apart from one another, until they simply disappeared, one by one.;43.0351999999995;-83.5247999999994
