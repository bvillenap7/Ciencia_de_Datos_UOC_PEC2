Large sphere above treetops that was gone in seconds.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably not a UFO, but cannot be certain.  PD));2017-07-14 20:00:00;1 minute;Large sphere above treetops that was gone in seconds. Took pictures of the Point Betsie lighthouse in Michigan on the evening of July 14th.  Was there to watch sunset.   Went through pictures today and noticed where I snapped a few pictures of the lighthouse, one had a large sphere by the tree tops.  It's large enough you can see the sun shining on it.   It must have flew away fast because my next picture it was gone.  I cannot explain what this.
