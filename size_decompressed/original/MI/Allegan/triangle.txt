While driving, we saw an unsual craft fly past us, with unusually flashing lights.;2000-10-20 01:30:00;2-3 min.;While driving, we saw an unsual craft fly past us, with unusually flashing lights. At first it looked like a wierd plane, but there where red and blue flashing lights, unlike those you would see on a plane.  The lights also swirled around the craft, while blinking.  As the craft went by us (we were driving) the back looked like a triangle, with three lights.  One at the top, and then two below it on the sides of it.We were heading west, and watched the craft travel southwest for a ways.  It was moving farely low to the tree level.  And looked of abnormal size.  We switched directions, instead of heading west, we turned south.  As we crossed a bridge, you could see it over the Kalamazoo River Bay, on M-89/M40.  The craft slowly lifted up higher then came down, back the direction it just came from.  Then it went below the tree line, and that was the last we saw of it.  Again, we don't think this was a plane at all...it was definetly in our opinion a ufo!;42.5256000000005;-85.8660999999995
Object hovered for over 1 hour flashing red, green, and white lights.;2015-09-20 22:00:00;1 hour;Object hovered for over 1 hour flashing red, green, and white lights. Saw a bright light in the sky.  As I took a closer look I noticed it was hovering far in the distance and it was flashing red, green, and white lights.  I watched for ten minutes and then went inside to get my parents, we all then went outside and witnessed this object hover high in the air for a long duration of time.  We then witnessed two (what we were assuming were jets) fly toward the hovering object at a very fast rate and got very close to it and flew away.  We then watched it slowly descend over time until it disappeared into the distance.  This all happened over a duration of 1 hour.;42.5256000000005;-85.8660999999995
Triangular light formation moved across sky very fast with no sound.  2 people saw it without pointing out to each other.;2018-04-07 01:00:00;15 seconds;Triangular light formation moved across sky very fast with no sound.  2 people saw it without, pointing out to each other. I was looking up at the stars, and suddenly this triangular light formation appeared.  It was either very large and up high or was small and low.  Made no sound, but moved across the sky very quickly.;42.5256000000005;-85.8660999999995
