Bright light/enormous aircraft hovering over Allegan County;2004-11-24 07:20:00;1-2 minutes;Bright light/enormous aircraft hovering over Allegan County On 11/24/04, while driving south between Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo on US-131, I saw an extremely bright light in the western sky.  Its size and magnitude were 5 to 10 times greater than Venus, which is often visible in the eastern morning sky.  It was about 7:20 A.M. and I was between exits 59 and 55 (Shelbyville and Martin) when I viewed this light. It appeared to be lower than planes should fly. It remained stationary, apparently hovering. Within perhaps a minute I came parallel to it and passed it. Looking through my back window, I perceived its outline enough to know that it was the largest airborne object I've ever seen and quite close.  (I'm afraid that I'd subconsciously invent details if I tried to describe what I THOUGHT its shape could have been.  All I can say with certainty is that it was long and immense.)  I called my fianc√© on my cell phone and described the object to him. He said to call him back if I found out any information about it.  I would have to imagine this object was seen by the other motorists on the highway with me. Realizing that my curiosity about this would probably be met with scorn or, at least, disinterest, I was hesitant to contact anyone. My curiosity bested me and I called Aeronautics in Lansing, but hung up in dismay over how to credibly word my inquiry. The next day I contacted the Allegan County Sheriff's Department. Their dispatcher said she had received no calls regarding this and suggested I call Dodgen Aircraft/Padgham Airfield. The gentleman I spoke to there also had no information.  My best guess is that it was some sort of military aircraft, although I have no idea why such a thing would be hovering over Allegan County. I have seen nothing about it on local news websites. Any information would be appreciated.;42.5256000000005;-85.8660999999995
