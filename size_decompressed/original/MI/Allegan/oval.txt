White oval shaped object crossing horizon at high rate of speed from North to South.;2015-07-18 22:12:00;1 second;White oval shaped object crossing horizon at high rate of speed from North to South. On 7/18/15 at around 10:00 P.M., I was at my residence, facing west, when I saw a crescent moon in the sky and a star to the right of it.  I thought at that time it would make a nice photo so I went in my house and got my cell phone to take a picture.  As I was taking the photo I noticed a bright oval shaped object crossing the horizon at a very high rate of speed.  For the very short time I observed the object it showed no sign that it was heading toward the surface it stayed on a horizontal path.  When I checked my cell phone I discovered that it had caught the image.;42.5256000000005;-85.8660999999995
