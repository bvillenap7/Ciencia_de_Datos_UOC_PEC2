two stationary orange fireballs;2000-09-09 22:15:00;10 minutes;two stationary orange fireballs We were driving eastbound on M-32 and saw two orange fireballs suspended in the sky to the south.  Cannot tell how far away they were, but they were only about 10-20 degrees above the horizon.  They stood still for about 10 minutes while we watched. Then they gradually (over about 5 seconds) extinguished themselves.  Prior to extinguishing, we noticed a smaller fire ball (about half the size) descend downward below one of the two, as if suspended by a wire.  It descended to the ground in about a minute. Two possible explanations:  there are some natural gas wells in the vicinity, however I am not aware of any flare stacks.  We have driven this road numerous times and have never seen any flares. Another possible explanation:  there is a air national guard air-base approximately 40 miles to the south, which might have been involved with nightime aerial military maneuvers;45.0191;-84.3862
