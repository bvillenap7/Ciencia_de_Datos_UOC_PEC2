We were driving down Fergus road in Saint Charles, Michigan, when we noticed a large sphere or sorts giving above a field.  We decided to turn down the road we followed it but it appeared as it landed in the road.  As we were watching it and approaching it disappeared but we did not see it move it appeared as if the lights shut off we drove up to where it was and there was nothing there.  The way it moved and behaved there is no way this was a drone.;43.2874;-84.158
