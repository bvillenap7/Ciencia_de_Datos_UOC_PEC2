Three bright orange lights arranged in a triangle, tip on top and two lights along the bottom, relatively low on the horizon, moving south to north, appearing to hover at some points.  Object was distant so only three lights were readily visible, however some light was evident behind the three main lights. Object appeared to turn south, dim and then instantaneously vanish.  Cloud cover was medium, and did not seem to be the cause of the disappearance.;43.2874;-84.158
