On the night of August 22nd, I was outside my house on my deck, enjoying the night, when all of the sudden, I looked behind me and saw 3 identical lights yellow-orange in color in a triangle shape.  I did not know what they were, but then the bottom 2 lights started moving around, much faster than any plane that I have seen.  For a while, they looked like they were almost chasing each other.  I watched them intently for about 20 minutes, then disappear, leaving only the top light.  Slowly, over the period of anout 5 minutes, it moved away.  Then, when my mom came home, I turned to look at her, then when I turned back, it was gone.  I must admit that I have not seen anything like this before, and this I could not explain. Thank you.;42.2103;-83.157
Red and white lights in the ESE sky.;2017-03-12 22:15:00;ongoing;Red and white lights in the ESE sky Noticed 2 bright lights about 20-30 degrees up in the ESE sky.  One a very bright white and the other red.   We thougth the white light may have been Jupiter, but both have remained in the same location for the last half hour.  Both seem to wobble slightly.   We drove to a nearby park to get a better look about 2 miles away.  They were dimmer from that location. I will e-mail 2 photos I took.;42.2103;-83.157
Ball of light hovering in Detroit Metro area.;2020-08-14 23:40:00;10 minutes;Ball of light hovering in Detroit Metro area. To the west, a singular light could be seen hovering high in the sky.   Shape appeared to change colors and slowly drift, but kept similar location in the sky. Upon extended observation, smaller dimmer lights seemed to drop from object...almost like floating stars that would drift down and dim.  Viewer continued to observe object until it dissapeared behind cloud cover.;42.2103;-83.157
