Orange fire disks over Wyandotte, Michigan;2012-07-20 22:01:00;10 minugdx;Orange fire disks over Wyandotte, Michigan I live on the Detroit River, near Lake Erie.  The Grosse Ile airport is within a mile. I am on the forth floor facing South.  I noticed something out of the corner of my eye.  At first I thought it was an airplane on fire.  Then one of the same come out of what seemed to me to be the water.  One on top of the first one I saw and one on the bottom.  They hoovered for a minute.  Then they took off toward the west.  I could see the after smoke or whatever aircrafts leave.  They were totally silent.  Before the first three were totally out of sight and additional three came out.  Never in the same line but in patterns of three.  I looked through a star gazer and the things were blinking so fast and vibrating so fast, I couldn't focus.  I was transfixed.  There were a total of 30.  I posted on facebook.  Has anyone in the Wyandotte area seen anything strange in the sky.  No replies.  I could not have been the only one to witness this.  They were not chinese laterns either.  I know what I saw.  Within 15 minutes there were commercial size airplanes going over the are! a quite a few times.;42.2103;-83.157
