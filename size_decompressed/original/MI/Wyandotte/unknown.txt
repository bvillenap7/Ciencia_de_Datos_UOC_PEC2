As i looked to the western night sky, i observed what at first thought to be a plane moving east to west, at incredable speed. My friend came outside, and i called him over to look, and then i noticed three more craft slightly south of the first object, all traveling in the same direction. The three that were together were in a triangle formation. All of the objects were as bright as a star, moving at least three times the speed of a normal jet aircraft. It took only about 30 seconds before the dissappeared on the horizen to the west.;42.2103;-83.157
