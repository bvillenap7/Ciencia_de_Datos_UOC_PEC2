Light that looked like a flame on a slowly moving object.;2009-07-04 00:14:00;5 minutes;Light that looked like a flame on a slowly moving object. Seen a spacecraft fly up from the ground in the distance and fly up and stop at about airplane distance in the sky.  It had a slow moving light on it that almost reminded me of a flame slowly burning.  It moved very slow once it hit appropriate level in the sky and contiued at a slower pace.   Suddenly vanished after about 5 minutes or so.   Was very strange and couldn't imagine it being anything else.  I've never seen anything like it.
