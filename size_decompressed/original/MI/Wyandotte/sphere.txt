Round Object seen hovering over steel factory.;2003-06-18 17:30:00;5-10 minutes;Round Object seen hovering over steel factory. At about 5:30PM, me and a friend were bike riding towards Biddle Ave.(also known as West Jefferson) We were stoped by a train where Emmons Blvd. meets the tracks. After the train had passed, I looked to the North and seen a silver object hovering above what I beleve is Great Lakes Steel. It appeared to have a greyish fuzz of haze around it. We observed it for about 5-10 minutes, then it seemed to just fade away. We are both students, 16 and 17 years old. I beleve in UFO's, but my friend is a bit more skeptic. We thought it might of been a weather balloon, but with the haze around it and the way it faded away caused us to think otherwise. ((NUFORC Note:  One of two reports from the same witness.
