The disruption around it, after we blew it up, was evident.  As you'll see it disappears as it did when it appear. we belive it is some kind of portal.  You'll see in the frame how the door moves.  This was in the NW sky from my point of view.  There is more, I hope you see what we see.  It almost has a taste of Mayan.  The shining, from the moon, is on the craft.  Thank you.

Please see the other report, submitted by one of the witnesses, for the same time and date.   We have looked at the 1-minute video, submitted by the source of this report, and taken by one of the witnesses.  It does indicate a light in a clear night-time sky, approximately the apparent size of the planet Venus, and the light appears to be moving.  However, we are unable to positively identify what the object is.  PD));42.2103;-83.157
