3 Large Orbs and 1 small orb floated over me. No sound.;2015-01-05 01:00:00;5 minutes;3 Large Orbs and 1 small orb floated over me.  No sound. Was going to my office in Plymouth (I live in Western Plymouth) ... seen 3 HUGE orange/yellowish orbs in a triangle formation and a smaller orb down at the bottom of the formation.  These floated over the North Church and across M14 freeway. Was trying to get my 4K camera Note 4 to operate .. just got it the previous day .. was shaking. I stopped on the bridge to do a photograph/4k Movie ..  however, I didn't know how to operate the camera -- shaking too much.  I was familiar with the iPhone 5 until I switched to the Note 4 for a brief period of time. All the orbs (round circular glowing lights like big balls -- no substance) vanished as they descended downward going from West to East. I fly drones, have flown single engine aircraft, have NEVER seen anything like this. I told my next door neighbor about this siting the next day. If I put my whole hand up that is what the size of 1 object would be in size.;42.3694999999999;-83.4768999999999
