A very strange pair of much wider than normal white contrails falling east in a completely clear daylight sky.  The trail dissipated quickly behind the craft.   Whatever it was, it seemed to be creating a lot of drag.  The first thought that came to our mind was a falling satellite of some kind.   There was another white or gray jet with no contrail much lower heading southwest at the same time.;42.3694999999999;-83.4768999999999
