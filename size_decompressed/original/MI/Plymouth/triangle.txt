Quiet, low-flying triangle shaped, with red and white lights.;2010-07-16 02:45:00;10 Minutes;Quiet, low-flying triangle shaped, with red and white lights. On July 16, 2010, at approximately  2:45 am, my sister and I went outside while she smoked a cigarette.  While talking, we noticed something in the sky that did not look like a plane.   As it flew closer, we noticed the shape of the object and that it was extremely  quiet.  It didn’t make a sound at all and was flying so low that we thought it was going to hit our house.   It was a triangle shape and had a few lights on it.  A white light and two red slow blinking lights.  Shortly after this flew out of sight, we noticed another one of these aircrafts flying towards us.  It looked exactly like the other one with all the same descriptions as the last one.   I definitely believed in UFO’s before this experience and now I REALLY truly believe there is something out there.
