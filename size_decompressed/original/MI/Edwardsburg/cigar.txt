Bright orange object reported in the Edwardsburg sky.;2008-06-11 23:30:00;5 minutes;Bright orange object reported in the Edwardsburg sky At approximatly 11:30P.M. a very large bright orange cigar shaped object appeared in the north sky just above a row of trees.  It sat there for approximatly 5 minutes and then just dissappeared.   This is the third time in about two months that I have seen this.  Sometimes it appears to move slightly up and down or back and forth but it always dissappears in the same way I have watched it for over half an hour once.  This is a rural area without alot of lights.  There is aircraft traffic and I have observed that if an aircraft comes into the general airspace it quickly dissappears.;41.7913;-86.0263
