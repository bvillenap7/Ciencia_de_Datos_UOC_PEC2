Orange objects traveling in the same flight path over Michigan;2008-06-14 22:00:00;10 Minutes;Orange objects traveling in the same flight path over Michigan I was wondering if anyone reported seeing strange lights in the sky over northern Elkhart County in Indiana and southern Cass County in Michigan Saturday night around 10:00 p.m. I haven’t heard anything about it on the news but I’m sure someone must have seen them besides our family. We counted 12 large orange lights spaced several miles apart moving at a high rate of speed all in the exact same flight path directly south of our house moving north northwest. They made no sound and disappeared behind the clouds. It was difficult to tell how large they were but I would guess they were anywhere between a mid size aircraft and a commercial jet. They appeared to be totally illuminated and the light was pulsating. There didn’t seem to a particular pattern but they were definitely on the exact same flight path.;41.7913;-86.0263
