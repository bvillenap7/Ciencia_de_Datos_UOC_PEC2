Daylight Cigar Shaped Craft;2003-10-18 15:45:00;1-2mins;Daylight Cigar Shaped Craft This sighting occurred while fishing on East Bay Lake on the Cisco Chain. This lake is located just over the Wisconsin boarder in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula on the Cisco Chain of lakes This event was witnessed by 3 people on the same boat. The sky was clear with very few clouds and the wind was coming out of the north, blowing south approximately 15-20 mph.  One witness noticed a strange object in the sky, directly overhead and drew the other’s witness attention to it.  The object was heading due north at a very slow rate of speed at best guess at an altitude of 5,000 feet and much to slow for any conventional aircraft. Since the wind was out of the north, the craft had to be propelled by something. However, upon closer observation the craft appeared smooth, silver in color, cigar shaped and had no other visible means of population. We all listened close for noise a conventional craft would make but the craft made no noise what so ever.  The absence of wings or external engines/jets made us really wonder what was propelling this craft. The craft continued on its northerly course at its very slow rate of speed until it disappeared behind a nearby tree line north of us. All there observers were under no influence of any substance, save coffee. One was a native to the area for years and works in the area in the tourism field. The other two witnesses, visiting from a large metropolitan area, are both professionals in there fields.  This account was submitted with the input and approval of all three witnesses.;46.2542;-89.2108
