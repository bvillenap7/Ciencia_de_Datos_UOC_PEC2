Orange Glowing Object traveling in lower skys;2009-08-15 23:59:00;2 minutes;Orange Glowing Object traveling in lower skies Around midnight on 8/15/09, Lake Ogemaw Michigan,  I looked up into the sky and noticed a glowing orange object moving at a steady pace.  It looked circular in shape but it also had a star-burst/multi-star spike shape on the front of the object.  The distance from the ground to the object seemed fairly low (approx 1 mile up)  I have never seen anything like this before, it looked odd.  One of the other observers mentioned that it could have been some sort of satellite coasting the sky, but I have never seen one, so I cannot comment one way or another.  By the time I went to get my camera, the object had passed on and could not be seen.;44.4157;-84.131
