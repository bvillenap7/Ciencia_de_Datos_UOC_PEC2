three star like dots over caseville, mi sky;2008-07-17 03:30:00;4-7 minutes;three star like dots over caseville, mi sky My friend and I were sitting on the beach of another friends cabin. The friend who owned the cabin had gone to sleep earlier. so it was me and one other male. While having a conversation, exchanging stories, i had looked up into the sky and saw something unusual. at first i didn't want to look crazy to my friend so i didn't say anything for a bit until i new for sure it was something 'different.' After finally deciding to point it out to my friend we whatched it then do the following. It was three dots, the same dimensions as the stars that were out that night, which were plentiful and bright since caseville, is in a small town with low light pollution. the three star-like dots moved across the sky faster than anyother plane i had ever seen before. they were in the formation of a isoscelese triangle, so originally we had thought it to be one object. this triangle actually crossed over, and turned out to be of the same length as orions belt. the star-like dot that was not adjacent to any other then proceeded to take off into a curved arch, the path was in the shape of a quarter of a circle, it then vanished, completely. the two in lead that were adjacent to one another then began to start almost convulsing back and forth, getting closer and further to one another rapidly and then too vanished. After viewing this we kept whatch on the sky and later saw an airplane, and a sattelite. neither of which had anything similar to which we saw.;43.9456;-83.2629
