Orange lights in a line;2012-04-19 21:33:00;2 minutes;Orange lights in a line I was sitting at my computer talking to a friend he told me their were some strange lights in the sky  I then ran outside and saw the lights.  They were orange in color moving east to west in a straight line.their were approx. 8-10 in the line.  As the lights moved they dissapered from east to west.  They appeared to be sphears.  I could not tell distance from my viewpoint.;46.4604;-90.1615999999998
One very large object with two lights;2020-04-08 21:00:00;10 minutes;One very large object with two lights I was at the dog park in Ironwood, Michigan. I was just watching the stars and two lights catch my eye in the east, not too long before the moon came up. At first it appears as if two flying lights are circling one another in really bizarre ways, both going at the same speed, rising and falling in an oval pattern for the majority, sometimes speeding up a little. After a while I noticed there was a pattern, and I think what I was seeing was one very large craft with two lights on each side of it, and it was spinning and rotating. It was very high up in the sky, so high that the lights were so dim my camera wouldn't catch it, but if it was one large object, it must have been enormous. It looked quite abnormal.  Watching it actually made me a little dizzy.  I couldn't really say how high up it was, but it seemed very high up and the craft VERY large. I was watching it for several minutes, maybe 5-10 minutes, before it slowed down and then made a dead stop, and hoovered in the air in the same spot for the remaining time I was at the park, at least 20 more minutes, and just appeared to be two stars, one brighter one on the left and a dimmer one on the lower right. I plan to return to the same spot tomorrow night with a better camera and see if those two stars are still there.;46.4604;-90.1615999999998
