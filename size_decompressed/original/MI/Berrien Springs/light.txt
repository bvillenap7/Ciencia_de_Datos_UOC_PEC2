Erratically circling xenon colored light, which moved a great distance East in a matter of minutes.;2007-02-08 23:00:00;30 min.;Erratically circling xenon colored light, which moved a great distance East in a matter of minutes. Traveling Northbound on Old U.S. 31 from Niles, MI at about 11:00 pm 2/8/07, I spotted a light far into the West (toward Lake MI) that was very visible for my whole 20 min. drive. It was a light, which was circling clockwise, yet erratically.  As I arrived home, the light seemed to have moved from the far West to what seemed to be almost directly over Old 31. Woke up my father to witness this.  He is a private pilot who is familiar with the skies.  I did not have to point this light out to him, as it was very apparent.  After staring at the light for about 10 min., he told me that he had no idea what it was either. The color was white, and reminded me of xenon light, there were no beams at all.  (very light cloud cover was present). There was absolutely no apparent source, and we were even unable to tell if it was coming from or towards the geosphere.  After observing this phenomena for about 15 min. we went inside, puzzled. ((NUFORC Note:  In most cases like this one, we would ask whether the light might have been an advertising light.  However, in our experience, most modern advertising lights have multiple beams, irrespective of whether they are based on multiple incandescent lights, or on a laser system.  We do not know what the witnesses observed.  PD));41.9476588235294;-86.3447411764706
