We both saw a blue white ball of light fall in a east to west direction  in a slight arch. With arm outstretched it appeared the size of a thumbnail.We could not see where it may have gone. We spend a lot of time watching the skys as we live far enough from the city of Adrian to not be bothered by city lights.I have taken investigation  training from Mi Mufon in the last few years but am nolonger a current member.;41.8672;-84.2141
