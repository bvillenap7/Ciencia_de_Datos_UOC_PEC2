I've spent nearly a year debating what I saw trying to conclude that it was actually cause by human hands.   I watched a sphere shape object cross over a lake, then make two quick movements at a rate of speed that would be impossible by human means.  I was able to watch and discern that it was not a light as it looked like a green marble flying across the sky.  I watched it for only a few seconds, but those few seconds were very clear and I had enough time to recognize that it was not a strobe light or airport light or any type of light, for that matter.  I do not believe there are extra-terrestrials however, this experience has challenged my faith.   What I saw was distinct enough that I was able to close my eyes and continue watching it fly across the sky and a nearby lake.;45.357600000001;-84.9088000000011
