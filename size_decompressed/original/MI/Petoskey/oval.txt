Large oval seen moving through night sky by Lake Michigan;2013-08-15 22:00:00;10 minutes;Large oval seen moving through night sky by Lake Michigan At about 10:00 p.m. a friend and I decided to walk down to the bay along a walking path that is between the shoreline and a row of cottages.  Many of the cottages were lit up like Christmas trees, and we could see the interiors, so we were stopping and admiring them as we slowly walked along.  The cottages are old and surrounded by very tall mature trees.  As we stopped to admire one of the cottages, I happened to notice a very distinct large black oval shape in the sky, above the trees, blotting out the stars.  There was no moon, and the sky was full of stars so this was very noticeable.  The large oval shape was some distance away, just above the tree tops but I can’t estimate how far away it was.  It was very long and rounded at both ends.  It was also very tall.  It was huge.  There were no lights to be seen on it anywhere, and no wings, tail rudder, or any other appendage type of thing.  It was totally silent.  I called this thing to my friend’s attention and we watched it as it moved south very slowly and deliberately with absolutely no noise.  We decided it couldn’t be a cloud because the sky was cloudless, and this object was regularly shaped and moving all of a piece at a steady rate.  After standing and watching it for about ten minutes, we both were suddenly afraid.  We were standing in the open and we immediately ran for cover under trees at the end of the path.;45.357600000001;-84.9088000000011
