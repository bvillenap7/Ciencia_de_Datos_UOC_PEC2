On November 3, 2012 at approximately 9:35:36 PM EST,  a single bright orange orb with a red haze floats across the northern sky of Petoskey, MI. The orange fire orb moves silently through the cloudy night, a cool breeze passes by. Not a star or glance of moonlight in sight.   A single tree stands bare swaying through the light as it moves at a moderate rate of speed. Glowing in the air it remains steady traveling northwest to southeast in an arc like motion while hovering far below the cloud line and peaking high above homes and farm land. The flight pattern doesnâ€™t match up to a helicopter or plane and there is NO SOUND. As the orb floats across the sky, two smaller lights appear to move outward and back in.  It then moves quickly to the left and flashes forward before slowly blinking and fading away into the clouds.
