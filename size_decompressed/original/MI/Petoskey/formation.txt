Multiple lights flying in triangular formations. 3 witnesses.;2014-03-31 05:00:00;30 seconds;Multiple lights flying in triangular formations. 3 witnesses. I was standing outside with my two roommates talking about weird strange things in the sky and how lights sometimes appear towards the southern sky.   We were smoking a cigarette when one of my roommates was looking up in the sky and saw a formation of lights in the eastern sky moving west.  My other roommate and I looked up in the sky and couldn't believe what we were witnessing.  The lights looked like stars light years away moving very quickly.   They appeared to be anywhere from 20-50 meters in diameter.  The distance is hard to judge considering the sky was clear of any clouds.  As the lights came closer, it looked like 30-40 lights forming into a large triangular formation.  Some of the lights were grouped together changing colors from bright blue, to green, and back to white.  It looked like a giant stingray was flying overhead.   There was at least 10 lights on each side of a giant V shape formation.  Much like birds migrating. About 10 seconds after we spotted the lights, the formation scattered and made and abrupt left turn, now heading South.  The V shape formation with 20 lights was flying at a consistent rate of speed.  There was no noise, no trails that we could see.  The other lights were scattering around the formation and weaving around each other very quickly.  It looked as if they were on patrol, flying down the coast of Lake Michigan slowly fading away in the southern sky.   The most spectacular thing I've ever seen in my life, and crazy because we were just talking about strange glowing lights in that direction.;45.357600000001;-84.9088000000011
