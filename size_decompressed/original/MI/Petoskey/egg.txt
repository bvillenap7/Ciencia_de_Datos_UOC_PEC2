Very large flouresent green/bright white egg shaped thing traveling extremely fast.;1997-11-22 16:15:00;6-8 seconds;Summary : Very large flouresent green/bright white egg shaped thing traveling extremely fast. I live in rural northern Michigan. I am a honest, no nonsense husband and father who was cleaning up outside the house before winter sets in. I happend to look up at just the right time to see a very large and very fast, floresent green object flying north. I only  observed it for a few seconds as it flew through a break in the clouds. I was shaking by the time I got back to the house to tell my wife. It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. The object was egg or tear dropped shaped. The green glow was surrounded by a bright white glow. Both the green and white trailed the object a short distance to form a short glowing tail. I was looking NW when I saw it.;45.357600000001;-84.9088000000011
