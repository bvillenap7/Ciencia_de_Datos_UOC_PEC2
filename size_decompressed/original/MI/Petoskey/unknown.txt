Strange lights in the sky that look like stars but we’re moving too quick to be satellites are airplanes  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-16 10:05:00;27 minutes;Strange lights in the sky that look like stars but we’re moving too quick to be satellites are airplanes that change direction rapidly It was not project blue beam!  And it was not Venus!!!!!!!!  It definitely was not star link...   It was not a plane flares it wasn’t Chinese lantern it wasn’t parachute it was not weather balloon and sure as hell wasn’t a Maroge, Multiple crafts traveling in erratic directions it wasn’t streamlined they were all moving differently in the sky changing course it was not a satellite and they were definitely not aircraft they moved to quick One light “And there were tons”  Traveled the equivalent of three of your palms in the sky within a second and a half,  They were existent stars that were moving in different directions and there is no way their trajectory with straight.  Like I said it was not airplanes  It was not weather balloons and the lights were bright in the sky and moving very quickly.;45.357600000001;-84.9088000000011
