I'm investigating a UFO siting for a newspaper. I'd like to get your expert opinion on whether or not this is an actual UFO or if this is a hoax. Here's the information I received from my interviewee: The sky was pretty bright blue at about 8:30 p.m. on Aug. 27, 2007, in Cadillac, Mich. At first I thought it was a plane, but the object was not making any noise and it did not leave a vapor trail behind it like the other planes I've photographed before. Then I thought it was a blimp, but there wasn't a platform below the body of the object for people to stand on. The object's shape is rectangular, and the color is very silver and shiny. I went inside to tell my family to come look at the object, but when I came back out (10 seconds later), the object had propelled out of sight -- or, at least, it was not near the same area as my first sighting. What do you think it is? I'm e-mailing a photo to the address listed at the bottom of this site. Please contact me.;44.2504000000005;-85.4300000000002
