While standing outside the back of my place of business, having a cigarette, I looked up and was watching the clouds...it was very sunny out, and there were alot of low-hanging, puffy cloud formations.  I happened to notice, for a few seconds, what seemed to be a tiny oval-shaped object move behind a cloud....it was so brief that I didn't think much of it at first. A moment or so later, I looked up and saw it again, this time in a large, cloudless area of bright blue sky...it looked very far away..my best guess is about 20,000-25,000 feet up...I figured it was far too high up to be a bird, and even though it was very tiny from my perspective..about half the size of a bb held at arm's length, I could still make out an oval shape to it.  It looked well lit from the sun, but not real bright...I pretty much had to keep my eyes on it at all times to keep from losing it.  It was moving in a straight line at a pretty steady pace..and at first, I almost dismissed it as a passenger plane...until it did a loop...a pretty sharp loop, actually....it went straight in another direction, and looped again....altogether, I believe it changed direction about 4 times, each time making turns that I think were far too tight to have been a plane.   I never heard any kind of sound to it, and after a couple of minutes of watching it, I lost it behind the clouds.;44.2504000000005;-85.4300000000002
