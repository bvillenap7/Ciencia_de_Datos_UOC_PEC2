It was 7:18 at night. I was inside the house. I could see the window. Suddenly I saw 2 lights, a red & a white 1. The red was following the white. They appeared slightly to the northeast of our porch. The event lasted about a half second. This has happened before, 2 times before this. Each time they were in the same spot, & they looked the same. The lights were small, hazy circles. They left a small trail that dissapeared quickly. The background was the dark sky. The lights were far above the trees. I know that these are UFOs because shooting stars (or burnig metors) do not happen in the exact same place, & around the same time. This is the 1st time I have reported this because I thought that the 1st times must have been a coincidence. Now I am convinced that these are UFOs. I will send a drawing of the event, so that you may investigate it as accurately as possible.(I am sorry I have no phisical evidence.);43.7499;-85.1601
