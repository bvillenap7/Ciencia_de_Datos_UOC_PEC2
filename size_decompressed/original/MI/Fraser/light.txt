star-like lights in the form of triangles and diamonds dancing in the late afternoon sky;2003-09-20 18:00:00;25-30 minutes;star-like lights in the form of triangles and diamonds dancing in the late afternoon sky My Brother was out in the yard and called to us to hurry and come look at this. In the sky directly above us were what we at first thought were hot air balloons that ascended so high they appeared to look like stars in the clear blue sky. There were 3 in a formation of a perfect triangle to the left and 4 to the right in the shape of a diamond. Then they began to dance in the sky with each other returning to their positions. Coming very close to each other but never colliding. There were 3 sets of these formations. One had a stream of light coming from it leading me to believe it was a hot air balloon but when it ascended up and disappeared I dismissed that idea. Nearing the 20 minutes of watching these star-like objects dancing in the sky others started to appear as dim stars and became brighter up to 50 were in the sky at one time dancing, but never colliding. They ascended and just disappeared. There was no sound, no aircraft in the area, no tails on the craft above us. The observers ranged in age from 81 a homemaker, a police detective (just retired)51, myself(laidoff)48, retired auto worker 53, spouse 54, niece 32, Ameritech line man, 51 and spouse, 51.;42.5401;-82.9468
Point of light following a plane;2017-10-03 06:08:00;20-30 seconds;Point of light following a plane I walked outside and looked up at the stars.  Orion is in the south and was a clear morning. I looked to the west and noticed a plane flying overhead, with a red blinking light and flashing strobe.  Metro airport is south and west of my house location.  As I stared at the plane I noticed something that appeared to be as bright as a satellite, noticeable but faint. I stared at this because the faint light appeared to keep the same speed as the plane, off the left wing.  I thought, how odd is this, the plane and light were moving from west to east.  At about the 11:00 position the plane and light seemed to converge.  I thought this was logical because of the difference in altitude between a plane and a satellite, but the light converging on the plane stopped and stood still for 1 or 2 seconds.  Then the light moved again, accelerating West in the direction it came from.  I looked at my watch, it was 6:08am.;42.5401;-82.9468
