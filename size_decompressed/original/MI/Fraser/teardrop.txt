I was making a right hand turn off of Grove onto 13 Mile Road, facing south. I noticed an orange light in front, but above me.  As I stared at it, I realized that it seemed to be falling toward me.  Directly toward me.  It was round, but it looked like it had a web of lights on top of it, making it look almost teardrop shaped.   At first, I considered it was flames.  I thought it might be a comet falling from the sky, so I turned onto 13 Mile road and pulled into the parking lot of the apartments that were west of Grove.  It had gotten higher in the sky at this point and looked like an orange dot.  It started moving north. I took a picture of it and watched it for a few minutes.  It seemed to just be standing in the sky at this point. So I continued heading west on 13 Mile Road to Schoenherr.  In the parking lot of the Kmart at 13 Mile and Schoenherr, the orange light was still visible and heading west, toward me.  As it was getting closer, close enough to notice the round shape again, I pulled around a building, and when I looked back, it was gone.;42.5401;-82.9468
