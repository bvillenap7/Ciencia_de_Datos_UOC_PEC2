As we drove closer It moved above the trees on the left side of the road.  It was a dark ball with a beam of light coming from left side of craft.  Light seemed to cut off rather than dissipate.  When we were right next to the craft (approx 200 ft. max) A diamond pattern of lights, yellow, red blue, and green, flashed rapidly.  The craft then appeared to turn in out direction at which time the pedal hit the metal and we were outta there.  This sighting was approx 5 miles north of Copemish;44.4503;-85.8879
