6 lights in the southwestern sky...;2000-02-29 21:50:00;10:00 pm;6 lights in the southwestern sky... i have been seeing usually only 1-2 light (changing colors red white green) for the last 4 years usually towards the the west of my house. last nite i saw 7 white lites in the southwest of me. they got bigger and smaller for about 7 minutes, also moving left and righ slowly...after about the 7 minutes they slowly dissapeared towards the southwest. when i do see the lights (like last nite) i also notice the dogs in the neighborhood barking the whole time they are visible. The one i see on and off throughout the years usually dissapears towards the west as soon or tight after i notice it. I tried to drive towards it about 3 years ago, but i could never get close to it. they usually don't show up until about 10 pm(when it gets dark) and just sit in the sky with no sound. i can see the switching lights around it with the binoculars, but not with the bare eye.;42.75224;-82.81142
