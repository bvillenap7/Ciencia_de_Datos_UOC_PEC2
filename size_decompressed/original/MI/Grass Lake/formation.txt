It was a wedge formation with 3 on one side and 2 on the other solid reddish orange lights.;2017-08-25 21:45:00;4 minutes;I was sitting at my fire pit when I saw them.  It was a wedge formation with 3 on one side and 2 on the other.  They formation was made of solid reddish orange lights, coming from east to west.  It seemed like they were flying rather low.  When I started to run into the house for my camera they veered to the south.  The three that were on the south side of the formation disappeared, while the 2 that were left behind, slowly faded.   Once I grabbed my camera  ( which had no SD card) I ran back outside and there was another single one coming from the exact same spot.It followed the exact same path while slowly dimming.  The lights did not blink and were not a color that is associated with aircraft that I know of. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide no contact information.  PD));42.2726;-84.1901
