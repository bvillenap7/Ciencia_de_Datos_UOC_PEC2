Square shape, bright lights;2008-05-09 05:11:00;5-10minutes;Square shape, bright lights Appeared as a very bright star in the distance and as it moved closer looked to be more square with four lights.  At nearly the same time a smaller 'star' or 'satellite' was moving across the sky but then two separate lights could be distinguished that went from horizontal (i.e. plane) to vertical in alignment.  NOT a red/green flasher that might be expected on a local/small aircraft.  And while the second COULD be a plane far off banking or something like that...the first craft was VERY bright and we are not in the proximity for landing lights...and heard no aircraft noise.;42.2726;-84.1901
