8-01 objects with red and white lights on crafts zig zagging and hovering with no sound.;2020-03-13 21:00:00;20 minutes;8-01 objects with red and white lights on crafts zig zagging and hovering with no sound. My children thought a drone was following so my friend and I went to check it out and there were 8-10 objects flying over the tree line.  They would sit in one spot then zig zag all over.  Lights were red and white.  One shot straight up and disappeared after hovering in the same spot for a few minute.  They were not in a single form line but at one point they all lined up but with a big distance between them.;42.2726;-84.1901
