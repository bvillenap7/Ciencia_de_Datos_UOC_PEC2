Glowing Orb;2012-07-10 23:05:00;4 minutes;Glowing Orb Looking south about 30 degrees up Mackinaw City Michigan  7-10-12   The event started in spectacular fashion similar to a roman candle in slow motion. 3 or 4 red and orange orbs then transforming into one orb which then faded away but reappearing 15 seconds later.  It moved around a little then getting real bright and then fading away.  Off to the right I saw 4 small lights moving away from the area. The main orb had a nucleus with a halo around it which I have about 30 seconds of video;45.7764000000001;-84.7244
