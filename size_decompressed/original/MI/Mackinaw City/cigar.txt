Cigar shaped ufo sighted over Mackinaw City, MI, traveling at extreme speed.;2007-07-30 13:00:00;1 to 2 seconds;Cigar shaped ufo sighted over Mackinaw City, MI, traveling at extreme speed. While driving south on US-23, I looked up and saw a cigar shaped object moving extremely fast from south to north. I looked like a dark grey cigar, and was moving so fast that if I blinked I probably would have missed it. It was at 12:00 o'clock high, altitude unknown. I'm retired USAF, so I'm accustomed to seeing airplanes flying at varying altitudes. This happened so fast that I could not gauge alt. though if I had to guess, it was at approx. 1,000 ft.
