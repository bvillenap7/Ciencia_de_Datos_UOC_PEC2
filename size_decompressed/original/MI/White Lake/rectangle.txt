Noticed 7 to 8 orange objects move across the sky, from West to East, in White Lake, MI.;2013-07-27 22:45:00;3 minutes;Noticed 7 to 8 orange objects move across the sky, from West to East, in White Lake, MI. On July 27, 2013, at approximately 10:45 p.m., in White Lake, MI, I stepped out back to have a cigarette.  At the time, the sky was almost completely clear, except for several thin clouds in the air.   I looked up at the stars and noticed an orange light moving from behind several tall pines which stand on a hill behind my house.  As I watched the orange light, which was rectangle in shape, I noticed about six or seven more move from the West to East, across the sky.  There was no particular pattern they were flying in, but all of them were moving in the same direction and clustered together (not to the point that it would have been part of the same object, but in close proximity to one another).  There was no noise and no blinking lights on these objects.   I woke my mom and had her come to the front of the house, where she observed two of the objects moving across the sky.  As we watched them, one of the lights seemed to disappear.;42.65012;-83.5073200000001
Rectangular ufo that moved slowly but disappeared and re appeared miles away, just about 500 ft off the ground.;2019-07-12 19:00:00;3 mins;Rectangular ufo that moved slowly but disappeared and re appeared miles away, just about 500 ft off the ground. We were driving down m-53 headed from work to get pizza. It was daytime. We all noticed what appeared to be,to me,a rectangle looking shaped object very slowly moving about 300-500 ft above the ground. It resembled a family pool or something floating, mid air. Trying to make sense of it,  I looked to see if maybe it was being pulled, like a banner, from the rear of a plane but there was no plane in sight. We had slowed way down at this point. Way too big to be a kite and moving like 5 miles an hour with a smooth progression, I knew I had no way to faxing this thing in my mind. It appeared black/brown in color and as I took note of the color, we were slowly driving so trees were moving in front of it. I noticed it started to angle itself differently. Like a picture frame slowly falling over. It had no visible lights. As it got almost flat, it suddenly dissappear. We pulled into the pizza place seconds later. We re-aquired it miles Away on the horizon, slowly ! moving across the sky again until it went out of view. It was antigravitic, rectangular and moved faster than the eye could see but still, also stood still and creeped along at other times.;42.65012;-83.5073200000001
