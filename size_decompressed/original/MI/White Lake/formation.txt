Originally thought it was fireworks above Grass Lake, but noticed lights were not dissipating.  Looked closer and saw it was hundreds of like white lights in formation dropping from several hundreds of feet in slow smooth motions like raindrops.   Drove closer using Google maps and could not find source.  Found multiple groups of people watching the show.. two groups said this is 3rd such occurrence in 2 weeks.  No explanation.  Believe to originate above Indian Springs Park in White Lake.   Lights eventually stopped moving and maintained a solid formation at 7:58PM exactly and then began to descent/land and by 8PM the event was over.;42.65012;-83.5073200000001
