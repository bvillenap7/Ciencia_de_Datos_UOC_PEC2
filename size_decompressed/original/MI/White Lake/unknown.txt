My son said Mom can an airplane blink? I was a bit thrown off but said why hon, He said look and pointed outside I tried to see somthing but saw nothing, and turned back saying go to bed son you have school tomorrow,  He got irritated an said no! mom it blinked look again.   So I went outside and stared above the trees an in the distance which made it about 1/4 dime size to the eye, was a triangle looking light that sat perfectly still and about every five minutes blinked off then on.   A second one a few miles away from it in the sky to our left doing the same thing.  I didnt think much of it and at first thought ok im just tired its a close stars or somthing.  Put him to bed came back and it was poof gone&gt then I thought more about it, planes dont do that, helicoptors dont do that. And stars dont turn off an on like that an then poof. So I thought it couldnt hurt to report it. Who knows might help in the future.;42.65012;-83.5073200000001
