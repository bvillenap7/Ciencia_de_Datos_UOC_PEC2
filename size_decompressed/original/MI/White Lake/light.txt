Helicopter Pursues two lights over White Lake, Michigan at high speed;2019-12-19 18:45:00;1:20;Helicopter Pursues two lights over White Lake, Michigan at high speed At approximately 18:45 traveling east on M59 in White lake Township, two lights, one white and a smaller light more of an orange color fly overhead of traffic followed by a helicopter. I’m not sure what size the lights were in relation to the helicopter but the larger white light was maybe half the size of the chopper. I thought the crafts were a formation of some sort but the orange light traveling next to the other larger light threw me off, because there were no blinking lights and no usual shape I could make out of the two. all three craft were traveling at high speed and after the trio started getting further ahead I notices that the orange light was getting smaller and fainter, it wasn’t visible at all after about 30 seconds after the initial contact. I could still see the blinking chopper lights still chasing the brighter white light until they both exited my frame of view. I wouldn’t have thought anything of the sighting if the small orange orb didn’! t dissipate out of nowhere, it didn’t make sense.;42.65012;-83.5073200000001
