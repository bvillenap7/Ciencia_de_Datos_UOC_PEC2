Bright orange “jelly bean” shaped craft near Oxbow Lake.;2014-07-04 22:50:00;10 minutes;Bright orange “jelly bean” shaped craft near Oxbow Lake. One very bright orange “jelly bean” shaped object was witnessed hovering low in sky near Oxbow Lake off of M-59 and Teggerdine Roads.  Saw object in sky after leaving shopping plaza in my car, with one other passenger. We were unable to photograph while driving, and pulled over at the intersection of M-59 and Teggerdine Roads into the parking lot of a local CVS drugstore.  The craft had since lifted much higher in sky and the orange color around it was gone.  There were white, red, and either blue or green lights flashing from underneath the craft which had ascended high into the sky.   The sky was clear, and fireworks being displayed all around the lake that night by homeowners had just begun. I did manage to get a video of the craft, but it is so high that it may not prove useful.;42.65012;-83.5073200000001
