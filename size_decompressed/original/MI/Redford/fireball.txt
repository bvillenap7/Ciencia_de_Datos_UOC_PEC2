Orange Fireballs Over Redford Michigan;2013-05-25 22:00:00;1/2 hour;Orange Fireballs Over Redford Michigan Occurred: 5/25/13 Time: 10:00 - 10:30 PM Location: Redford Michigan  Every Saturday my brother has a large group of friends over to BBQ, play horseshoes and sit by the fire.  Being a holiday weekend I decided to make the long drive with my other brother and nephew to participate in the festivities.  Shortly after dark (sometime around 10pm) my nephew pointed over my shoulder to the north and said, “What is that?!?”  I instantly spotted a large orange fireball in the sky slowly and silently traveling south west.  I yelled out to everyone to look (There were 12 people in the yard).  People immediately started downplaying the light as a “Chinese Lantern”, even after it disappeared in a blink before their eyes. Approximately 20 minutes later a second bright orange fireball appeared almost directly in the same spot.  This time it was travelling fast…a little slower than a jet, but faster than a small plane…and it disappeared in the same manner as before…like it instantly dematerialized.  Again I called everyone’s attention to it and they all saw it, but again they down played it as a Chinese lantern. Last year I had multiple sightings of these same lights and reported three out of the six sightings on this registry.   Whatever these are they are not Chinese lanterns as everyone keeps calling them.;42.3895190476191;-83.2925666666667
Orange balls of light made their way slowely and silently across the sky.;2014-05-31 22:27:00;15 minutes;Orange balls of light made their way slowely and silently across the sky. I live in redford michigan.  On 5/31/14 at 10:27 pm i saw 13 Orange looking orbs moving slowly across the night sky.  Some of the orbs were in a triangular formation of sorts, at least two of the orbs were flying alone together and as i watched the orbs move at least two just seemed to vanish in mid flight.   Then two of the orbs that were in one of the triangular formation vanished .;42.3895190476191;-83.2925666666667
