We both thought it was odd to be able to see a star during the daytime.  We stared at it for about five minutes.   The white light stayed in one spot and seemed almost as though it may have been moving around ever so slightly in its little area.  Couldn't tell if it actually was or if it was our eyes playing tricks on us.   After I researched that you can't see stars during the day we looked back up in the sky and saw that it was gone.   My husband then reported he saw one flash in the same area.   After that we didn't see it anymore.;42.3895190476191;-83.2925666666667
