Odd object moving west;2018-06-08 20:20:00;5;Odd object moving west Me and my daughter were working with our Escrima stick and she notice the object and told me to turn around.  It was not a plane or a jet or a Helicopter or a balloon.  It was silent. If it was a drone it would had to be huge from our distance,  It moved west but seem to had tiny moments of hesitations to its movement. It was dark in appearance no lights.  We tried to get the cell phone camera to record it but as always cell phones suck for a camera.;42.3895190476191;-83.2925666666667
