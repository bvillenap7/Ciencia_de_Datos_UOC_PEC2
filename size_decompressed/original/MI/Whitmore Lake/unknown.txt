I was watching in the distance how this flashing light appeared in the sky accompanied by another flashing light. My first instinct was hat they were airplanes but then as i saw there irratic movement i began to think differently. I ran inside and grabbed the video camera and i watched as they jumped around the sky left, right up down.. etc. It was then i saw this object that looked like a plane as well but closer with red and green and white flashing lights but as it came in fast, it slowed down and came to a complete stop and hovered then moved left after it was going right. One after another these crafts appeared, shifting speeds and flashing different colors, still surrounded by tinier flashes. I have all of this on video tape luckily and it's undeniable what you see. Along with this the same night, i saw what looked like twinkling stars in the sky but when i zoomed in with the camera they chnaged from red to green to blue and white. I have about a hour of footage this time. The crafta moved without any sound, shifted speeds, and wobbled while hovering in place. Some of them made hopping movements in the sky while moving. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that a twinkling star would have to be ruled out as a possibility, before we could conclude that the witness observed a UFO.  PD));42.4289000000003;-83.7828000000006
