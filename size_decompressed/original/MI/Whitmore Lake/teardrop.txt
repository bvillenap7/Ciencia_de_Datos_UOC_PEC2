All had sh;1999-11-16 19:05:00;2 min.;Objects crossed sky from approx west to east. 1 large and 4 smaller trailing objects. Observed for at least 2 min. No sound. All had short fiery  tails. I am a truck driver that is required to use a computer to record stops,breaks ect. so times and dates are exact. At 19:05 on 11/16/99 I had stopped for a coffee break at a small service station at Whitmore Lake, Mi. This is approx.10 mi. north of Ann Arbor,Mi. I walked out of the station, facing approx. due south. I noticed a bright light in the sky approaching from what I believe to be 250-270 west degrees. As it got closer, 4 smaller objects became visible trailing the large one. I had a very good view as the objects passed at approx. 20 degrees off vertical to my south. As they got closer, short blueish-white tails became visible. There was absolutley no sound. The smaller objects appeared to change position in relation to the larger one. My best description of shape is roundish to teardrop. Estimated size was  a dime held at arms length for the large one, and a B-B for the smaller ones. I had a completely unobstructed view for near 2 mins. It faded out of sight-range headed 75-90 degrees east. I have been an avid night sky watcher for years. Truck driving for 17 years mostly at night. I also spent the mid 70s as an Air Force flight line mechanic.My first thought was it was a meteor, as i had been anticipating the Leonids. When I first saw this Iwas expecting it burn out soon. I was greatly surprised to watch it almost from horizon to horizon. The skies were completely clear. Many aircraft were visible in the area as I was approx. 30 miles NW of Detriot Metro airport. It had to have been visible to pilots and ground controllers in the area. As I said, I have been sky viewing for years,and this was something completely new and different to anything I ever saw before. I can be best contacted between 1200-1600 eastern time.;42.4289000000003;-83.7828000000006
