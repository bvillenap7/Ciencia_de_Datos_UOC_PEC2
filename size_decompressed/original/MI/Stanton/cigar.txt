The siting lasted about 3 minutes My wife and i were walking the dogs near the local cemetery approximately 3:15 P.M. on the afternoon of 10/21/12.  I noticed a cigar shaped craft flying alongside a airliner in the sky north west of our position.  Both craft were traveling in the same direction SW.  I took video with my camera phone, but the camera is only a 2.3 magapixel with no zoom, so the videos are of no use. I can send them if you think they may help?  We watched them until the cigar shaped craft just disappeared while still flying next to the airliner.;43.3058;-85.0995
