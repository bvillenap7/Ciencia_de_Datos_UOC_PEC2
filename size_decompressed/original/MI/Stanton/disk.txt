When we first seen them , all three were distinguishable as seperate ships. After a moment of observing them the first  two ships briefly merged into one , then seperated again. I pulled into my sons school and parked in the back lot until I could no longer see them. My son observed them until he had to get to class. In all I watched them for about four - five minutes as they headed southwest.;43.3058;-85.0995
