Whitish yellow saucer disk lights up near Phil's store in Fenton;2006-07-26 00:40:00;1 minute;Whitish yellow saucer disk lights up near Phil's store in Fenton Near Phil's Store in Fenton, I witnessed what appeared to be an airplane (typical lights and in a straight trajectory) in the night sky as I was looking out a window, after looking away for a few seconds object had turned 90 degrees or sharper in another direction.  Continuing watching, the plane appeared to stop for a few seconds and then it headed right in my direction.  Object was at an elevation of approximately 100 yards and was about 0.2 miles away upon heading toward me.  As the object approached, the airplane lights shut off and some subtle white lights lined the bottom. Right after this, a disk of white/yellow light began radiating for the object.  The light was so bright it was like a flourecent.  This part of the sighting was definitely unearthly to say the least.  It lit up the way a spinning ufo firework appears from the bottom.  The entire time this was happening it was heading in exactly my direction from 0.2 miles away, and lit up when it was perfectly clear for me to see!  By the time I ran from the window thinking I personally was being pursued, the object was about 100 yards away and closing. I'm not positive, could have been from initial shock, but I think I remember beeing shined on with a directional light.  I've been paranoid at night after this event occured.;42.7893000000003;-83.7134999999999
