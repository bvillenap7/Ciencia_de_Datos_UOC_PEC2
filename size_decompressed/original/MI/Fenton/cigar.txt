6 cigar-shapes dash across the sky;2011-10-07 23:43:00;8-10 seconds;6 cigar-shapes dash across the sky I took the dogs out to do their business before going to bed.  As usual, I stood on the edge of the deck looking up at the sky.  This position puts me facing almost due north. It is a perfectly clear night with minimal light pollution.  Just as I started to look down, I caught a glimpse of movement and looked back up.  I saw 6 cigar-shaped objects appear in the area where I saw movement.  They were very high and faint, but were light orange-colored on the tips, with a darker appearance in the center.  They  moved quickly from East to West in a straight line, then as I watched, moved into a delta cluster of 4 objects, with the remaining 2 tucking in together to the north side of the delta.  They were out of sight in 8-10 seconds.;42.7893000000003;-83.7134999999999
