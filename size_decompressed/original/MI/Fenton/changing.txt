I had showed my sister and she looked at and said huh I’m not sure, she then looks in other places of the sky and said there's no moon. I had said that’s really strange. My sister then had a phone call and went inside, while I stayed out there for a little while more. The strange object was many shapes, it was first circular, then it had spread out in a long faddish way and started to move and split into to two parts, with one larger part and one smaller part that were not even. Then the smaller part then started to move west and fade little by little, with nothing but a very foggiest orange color in the sky after this occurred for about 3 minutes total. With not one sound insight when  occuring.;42.7893000000003;-83.7134999999999
