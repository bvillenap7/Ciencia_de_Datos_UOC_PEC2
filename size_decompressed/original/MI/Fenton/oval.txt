Copper/amber object orbiting very quickly across the sky in the afternoon;2011-07-10 14:00:00;10 minutes;Copper/amber object orbiting very quickly across the sky in the afternoon This occurred many years ago as I recently realized what I saw could not be explained by rational means. I was on a lake looking up at the sky when I saw what looked like an amber or copper colored object moving across the sky straight above. At the time, my friends on the boat said that it was a satellite but I now realize that that is not possible based on how clear I could see it and how large it was. It was perhaps the size of a large plane flying at 30,000 ft but was going much faster. It went from east to west across the sky, almost as if it was in orbit. It took roughly 10 seconds to cross the entire sky and therefore I believe it was going very fast. As it moved across the sky I could see the sun reflecting off the side, which changed as it moved as you’d expect as the suns location is fixed. It was not perfectly oval but had some features that I could not distinguish. It crossed the sky 4 or so time over a 10 minute period. Perhaps it was the intern! ational space station but based on how quickly it was moving and how visible it was to the naked eye I now don’t believe it could have been that.;42.7893000000003;-83.7134999999999
