As I was driving my car down a paved country road at dusk, a large round craft with pale green lights circling around the bottom of it instantly came over a hill very close to the ground. It stopped in the air, right over my car as I drove by, and immediately backed up, and disappeared from the same direction it came from. My girlfriend was with me and we both saw it.;42.7893000000003;-83.7134999999999
