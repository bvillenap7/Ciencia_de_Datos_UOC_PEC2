Dark object in the sky over Michigan, reflecting sunlight.;2003-09-20 19:00:00;20 minutes;Dark object in the sky over Michigan, reflecting sunlight. An object of irregular shape moving slowly from west to east, slightly to the north of our position, moving more slowly than an aircraft, no lights on the object, but with irregular flashes of reflected sunlight. When the object was not reflecting light, the body of the object could be seen, but no details were vivible, no wings or any protrusions, just the dark object. While it was impossible to determine the actual height of the object, I estimate that it was more than one and less than five miles above the ground. No sounds were heard, no alterations in velocity were seen, and it moved slowly out of sight.;42.4712;-83.1426
