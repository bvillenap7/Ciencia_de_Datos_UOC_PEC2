I was scanning the sky while letting the dog out and saw the full moon just to the left of Orion which was about due West.  I continued scanning East and saw Jupiter behind me at about NWW.  As I began scanning back to look at Orion, I noticed two very bright stars, brighter than Jupiter.  I thought to myself, these weren't here a minute ago.  So I just stared at them and they just began fading away to nothing.  They were not moving that I could tell, just fading away the way a very bright shooting star fades, but not as quickly, and at the same exact pace.  These objects were the distance away from each other approximately the distance of half the constellation Orion.;42.667;-85.6214
