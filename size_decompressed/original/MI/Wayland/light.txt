Bright orange bobbing light;2005-06-08 10:25:00;30-45 seconds;Bright orange bobbing light I went out on my front porch to smoke and in the NE sky over my neighbors house I saw a very bright orange light moving to the south. It grabbed my attention because it was bobbing in the sky unlike a plane or star. It was moving up and down as it traveled south. As it went behind my neighbors tree in thier front yard I tried to keep my eye on it...finally when the light reappeared it was far off and very small and disappeared immediately. It was gone in probably 3 - 5 seconds. This is something I have never seen in my life. I love to watch falling stars and this was not one of them. I stayed outside for about 5 minutes trying to rationalize what I just saw and I saw several jets in the air with thier blinking lights just to tell myself this was something different and it was. That is why I am at this site now. This was not ordinary.;42.667;-85.6214
