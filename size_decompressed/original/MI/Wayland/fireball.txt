Two fireballs, 20 minutes apart, in different counties.;2011-07-14 22:00:00;45 minutes;Two fireballs, 20 minutes apart, in different counties. While driving south, in Kent County, traveling at approx. 65 mph, I noticed a yellow-amber light off to my left.  The object appeared to be below the cloud ceiling, appeared to be stationary at first.  The object then began to travel NW the object traveled a short distance, then stopped.  The object repeated this maneuver 3-4 times before traveling steadily NNW and continuing on its trajectory.  I viewed the object for 5-6 minutes, (during which the aforementioned events occurred) until the object was in a position as such that I could not view it from my vehicle window and continue to drive safely. 15-20 Minutes Later... While traveling East, in Kalamazoo County, at approx. 65 mph, I noticed another yellow-amber light remaining stationary.  I approximate the angle of elevation to be between 55-70 degrees.  I viewed this object for 3-4 minutes, all the while remaining stationary.  The object's luminosity began to dim simultaneously, the object began to lose its yellow-amber hue, quite quickly, and began to turn a blue-white color.  I watched as the object dimmed and disappeared from the sky.;42.667;-85.6214
