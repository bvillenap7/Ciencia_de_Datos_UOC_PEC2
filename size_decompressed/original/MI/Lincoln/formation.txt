3 orange lit craft in v shape that appear to what seemed out of nowhere! Michigan;2019-05-17 22:45:00;1-2 minutes;3 orange lit craft in v shape that appear to what seemed out of nowhere! Michigan I was looking out at a star but this star is somewhat odd because it seemed to have different color lights admitting from it.  I started seeing some oranges lights coming above the tree line.  What made me look out was the loud plane like sound but it didn’t last long like usual.  Then all of a sudden 3 quote large spot light orange lights, very low in a v like shape appeared right out of no where!  The three lights looked like they were right over our house.  They stayed in the v for about 10 seconds.  I grabbed my phone and flashed a picture and they then started moving in a fast circler way and just disappeared completely after about 30-45 seconds.  It was like they just came out of the stars. Afterwards tons of planes started roaming the same area.  It’s calmed down, but you can still hear craft outside.;44.7134;-83.3912
