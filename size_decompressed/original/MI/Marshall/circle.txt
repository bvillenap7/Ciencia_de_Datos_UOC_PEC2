Fast moving, large orange orbs in the sky.;2020-12-24 20:10:00;1 minute;Fast moving, large orange orbs in the sky. In the Eastern sky, we saw a cluster of orange orbs/circles. They were pumpkin orange in color and sporadically placed in the sky, miles apart. Each one moved from the South East sky towards the North East sky where they eventually disappeared. What really caught our eye was how fast they moved. They looked quite a distance away - almost like it could possibly be a plane or satellite, but they were moving much faster than any aircraft could possibly move. Our next guess was potentially Chinese lanterns that must have been closer than we realized (the sky was dark and partially cloudy). However, the air was extremely wet and rainy, and we don't believe the fire inside the lanterns could have withstood the wet, breezy, and cloudy air without faltering.  My father, a very logical and reasonable man was the one who first saw them and called my mom and I outside to see them after he had let our dog outside. My mom just rolled her eyes and went back inside, but my dad and I stood there watching until they  just disappeared.  We've been researching and trying to deduce what the lights could be and the closest thing that we can find to what we saw are other UFO reports, which led us here.;42.272;-84.9638
