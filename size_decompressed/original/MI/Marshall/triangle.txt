To the West in close proximity to Battle Creek airport, I thought I was looking at a very bright star.  The light became bigger and moved to the left and then up, which really caught my interest.   I then noticed a airplane in the same area approaching the light.  The airplane got rather close and then went off course to descend away from the light towards airport to the right of the light.  I know it is the airport because I have seen Battle Creek Airshow from my home.   As the plane was descending, the light moved right, then up, and finally moved left where it stayed for quite some time.  I tried recording on my phone but my phone does not have good resolution. Through the binoculars there appeared to be three light attached to one another.  I cannot be so sure on the shape of the light, but it did appear triangular.;42.272;-84.9638
