((HOAX??))  Awesome lights , made me feel scared but giggley;2008-02-10 21:45:00;? no clue;Awesome lights , made me feel scared but giggley IT was about 9.45 as I was letting my dog out in the back yard she was acting funny  as I turned my head to see what was wrong I looked almost eye level as I was standing inside my back door mind u its about 2 below here I was so  in awe that I cant say how long I stood  there. I dont know the shape but the colors were beautiful as I told the police office I was so shook up I had no idea how big it was  he asked me as big as a football field hey I had no clue. The only sound i heard was my heart pounding in my ears. I must say it scared the crap out of me. I ran to get my phone and when I ran back to the door it was gone  But I had an awesome feeling  cant describe but it was like a giggle in my belly. Scared hey yes. everyone is scared of the unknown . but I am glad i did see whatever it was If that makes any logic to you ((NUFORC Note:  Probable hoax, we assume.

Unexpained red lights;2012-05-12 22:30:00;30 minutes;unexpained red lights My family was driving back from Battle Creek MI, as soon we entered city of Hastings there were multiple red lights in the sky.   I pulled over, my wife and step-daughter tried to take pictures. Then red lights started to vanish one by one. As soon as we got home I zoomed in on the only picture and there was a yellowish blur not far from the other lights. We were on M-37 North when we say it.;42.6402;-85.2973000000001
