big black triangle shaped object lasting 20 seconds or so overhead then gone without any sound;2004-05-19 21:30:00;about 20 sec.;big black triangle shaped object lasting 20 seconds or so overhead then gone without any sound My stepson and I were in the house,I was watching tv and my stepson was in his bathroom. My husband was in the shower in the 2nd bathroom. All of a sudden my stepson and I both heard this low rumble and was getting louder by the minute. We heard this noise for about close to a minute before we both went running outside the front door. We looked up and saw this HUGE black triangle shaped thing go over the treetops right directly over head. There were no lights whatsoever but it was really really big. The noise was like a low roar and lasted maybe about 20-30 seconds. I thought it was an aircraft from the army, like one of those stealth bombers. I have never seen one except on tv but there were no lights anywhere on it. After it went over us it was gone, not one sound. Just like it had vanished into thin air. My husband never heard anything.

Strange Triangular UFO;2007-02-01 23:00:00;5-10 minutes;Strange Triangular UFO Me and my brother were outside at about 11:00 pm sometime in February. I was grabbing boxes out of my moms vehicle since we just moved. We moved into the deep country, so I know I didn't see an illusion or anything. What I saw was a large, glowing orange ball of dim light. There was(what I thought to be) a rectangular shaped craft floating some ways above the orange ball. It was to the right of the orange ball, hovering vertical to it. Then the rectangular craft slowly floated vertically towards the orange ball. Then the orange ball floated slowly away, then took off faster than anything that I have ever seen. That is when the rectangular ship stopped, and began floating over my house.   As it turns out, the ship was a huge triangle like ship, with three lights at each point. The light in front was blinking blue, and the two in back were blinking red. The craft was completly silent, except for a small buzzing noise. It flew over my house at about tree level, so it was very close. Then it turned right, and began flying away from my house. That is when I noticed that the craft had three massive rocket looking things on the back, which were glowing a dim, bright, neon color. Of course, I ran inside of my house, telling my family what I just told you. My family is of the skeptical type, and me and my brother are the only ones in our family who believe in this stuff. So then I ran back outside, to see that it had turned back, and was flying over my house again. I ran back in the house, searching for a camera, to find out that it hadn't been packed yet. When I returned outside, the craft had disappeared. I don't know what it was, all I can say was that it was very strange.
