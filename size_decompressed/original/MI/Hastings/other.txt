Rural South West Michigan;1983-08-14 02:00:00;hours;Rural South West Michigan I was awakened by a strange humming sound.  Looking north from my bedroom window I could see lights just over the hill behind me.  I watched for a hour or better as the lights neared the top of the hill and again dropped behind the hill.  I still was not concerned thinking it may be kids or something I could exsplain.  Then the craft broke the top of the hill and slowly moved east along the ridge.  I know my military aircraft and this was not military.  I grabbed a monocular and glassed the craft as it dropped again behind the ridge.  It looked like a aircraft but with very short wings less than 6 feet, the fusalage was aprox 25 feet long, with a high wide tail.  Note this was not a airplane it was moving very very slowly. Now I was becomming concerned, I watched it return to the top of the ridge now moving west along the ridge.  My blood went cold and I was shooked when it's pilot turned looking directly at me then slowly accelorated making a growing huming sound until the craft made a boomings sound and disappeared in a flash of bright light. One last note the being inside was typical large head large dark eyes, but when it looked my way, and this may sound weird.  It told me it knew I was watching it.  It communicated this directly to my thoughts.  I have told three people about this since it happened in the 80s, I did not want to sound like a UFO kook.  I know we are being watched.  I stood guard the next three nights it did not return, this exsperiance left me with a feeling that I needed to protect my family.;42.6402;-85.2973000000001
