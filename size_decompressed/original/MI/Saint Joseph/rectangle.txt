I was facing South and I was looking up at the bright moon to my right.  My gaze drifted to straight ahead when I saw a light out of the corner of my left eye.  I quickly turned to face it when a brilliantly bright light came out of it at me.  I am not joking. It felt and looked like as if someone held a camera inches from my eyes and set off the camera's flash directly into my eyes.  It hit more of my left eye than my right. But both are effected because it has been over an hour now and I am still seeing spots.  I did however see the object in that split few seconds before the flash.  It was rectangular shaped. Dark brassy/brown in color.  It was silent and appeared to be just floating by.  After the flash, I could no longer see the object. It was as if it just disappeared.  It startled me but I tried looking for it for a while, but it was gone.  I just hope this didn't damage my eyes.;42.0581000000001;-86.4808000000001
