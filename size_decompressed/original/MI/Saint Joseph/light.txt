There were not blinking or colored lights visible. There was no sound audible. While sitting outside watching for shooting stars my dog and I witnessed a cluster of three bright white lights moving at a high rate of speed in a south shoutheasterly direction. They were above the clouds but very low. There were other objects in the sky during the night which could be easily identified as airplanes by their blinking lights and their landing lights are only visable when they approach my vision and not when moving away from my vision. These lights were brighter than landing lights and moving away from me about 45 degrees from the horizon. There were no sounds like when aircraft fly over and lower than when I see satilites. The objects left no trail and disappered when they went behind cloud cover and reappeared on the other side. My computer was on inside the house but did not seem to be affected by the object. I am not sure what I saw but it was not an airplane, sattilite, hilicopter or anything else I can think of. I decided to send this information in case there may be other sightings.;42.0581000000001;-86.4808000000001
Rolling light in sky puzzling;2005-07-21 11:03:00;48 minutes;Rolling light in sky puzzling It was in the North Eastern sky. (Not a spot light, no Norther lights). It was a ball of white light that kept out lining the shape of an oval. You could only see the light as it passed through the clouds, as it made the shape of the oval ....it looked as though it were a rolling light out lining the shape of something. You could not see the light where there were no clouds. It never stopped....and it only went away when the clouds were gone, (although I think it's still there). There are no storms tonight no lightening, no northern lights and no spot lights being projected upwards. What do you think?

Two bright gold light tails moving west toward Lake Michigan in early morning hours.  Moved in formation, very quickly and low in sky.;2006-10-16 04:30:00;30 seconds;Two bright gold light tails moving west toward Lake Michigan in early morning hours.  Moved in formation, very quickly and low in sky. Out of a large window, I saw two gold/orange light trails moving very quickly in formation across the night sky.  The two light tails seemed to be flying together, 2,000 - 3,000 ft. above the groud.  I live in an area where jet traffic is rare, and these two light trails acted unlike anything I've seen or imagined.  The light trails were moving west, over Lake Michigan.  At that time of day, in this small town, I heard no sound associated with these lights, which stretched for over one hundred feet.  I generally ruled out meteors, because they appeared to be too close to earth, and also appeared to be in formation.  Obviously, aircraft are on this path toward O'Hare hundreds of times per day, but these lights were WAY to close to the ground to be on approach, and there were no flashing lights.  In fact, I saw no craft, but just the tails, which were very bright and consistant lights.  The tails did not spread out, or get weaker as they moved across the the sky, like I would expect a meteor to do, but rather they extended for a distance, then just quit shining.  Again, I have been on over 1,000 flights, and enjoy aviation and astronomy, and I've never seen anything that created a tail of light like this.  The brightness of the light, the speed at which they moved, and the relative closeness to the ground, made me believe that I was seeing something different than I've ever seen before.

I saw bright lights on two occasions over Lake Michigan a little after 10 p.m. on February 7, 2007;2007-02-07 22:00:00;3 minutes;I saw bright lights on two occasions over Lake Michigan a little after 10 p.m. on February 7, 2007 I was looking out over Lake Michigan from my bedroom window a little after 10 p.m. on the 7th of February and I saw a rectangular shaped light over the lake for approximately 3 minutes.  It was brighter than the airplanes I usually see.  It kept winking on and off until it finally winked off for good.  Later that night I looked out again and saw red and white colored flashing lights in a shape that seemed oval or saucer shaped.  It was so low that it looked like it was hovering directly over the lake.  It didn't move for a few minutes and then it suddenly zig zagged back and forth at an angle a couple of times util the flashig stopped and it disappeared.;42.0581000000001;-86.4808000000001
Strange red & white flashing lights over Lake Michigan;2007-03-05 21:00:00;minutes;Strange red & white flashing lights over Lake Michigan I also have been seeing strange lights over Lake Michigan near the water treatment plant. They're bright red and white flashing lights like an ambulance over Lake Michigan.  The shape the lights make is more oblong than circular.  They hover, float slowly and wink on and off.  I'm also seeing planes flying at the same time and these are not planes.  I'm hoping more people will come forward from my area to report the same thing.
