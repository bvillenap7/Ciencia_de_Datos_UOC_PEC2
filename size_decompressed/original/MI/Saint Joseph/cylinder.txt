I woke up at 1:00 a.m., ate a snack, and then was leaning out my bedroom window to smoke a cigarette.  I was looking at the ground when I noticed this bright light on the ground moving towards me, so I looked up and the next door house, which was empty, poured out this bright light. It was all lit up like a huge spotlight was on the other side of the house. Then I looked over the house and it appeared that an object was hovering above and a couple houses down.  It was a noiseless, barrel shaped object with a white glowing end.  It looked like it was white kind of like the space shuttle.  It made this chh sound like the special effect sound of the astronaut jet packs right before it disappeared right before my eyes.  I wondered if I should go out and look for it when I had 2 very strong thoughts: 1: They're not here for me and 2: You have to go back to sleep. The next day I told my boss of it and either that day or the next he emailed me an internet news report from the local station WNDU out of South Bend, IN that said crop circles had been reported in the next county:  Cass County.
