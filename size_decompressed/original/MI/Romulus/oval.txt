sideways neon green oval shaped ufo seen in romulus, Michigan.;2007-07-31 23:00:00;about 45 minutes;sideways neon green oval shaped ufo seen in romulus, Michigan. my sister, her boyfriend and i were sitting on the deck and we were talking about how when i was younger i used to always call planes U.F.O's and when we were done saying talking about that, my sisters boyfriend said, look, there goes your U.F.O. right there, then he laughed a little, me and my sister turned around and our jaws dropped...the ufo was shaped like a sideways oval, it was neon green (like what you would see at a night club just brighter), and was moving very slowly, looked like it was just motionless until i went to go get my glasses...we were freaking out (my sister and i) so we ran over to our neighbors house at the time and pounded on the door, they came out and we told them about what we were seeing and told them to go look at it just so they know we werent crazy, they came out and gave us the same expression we gave them... we called 3 different news stations and all of them thought we were making it up...we started chasing after it in the ! direction it was heading to see if it would do anything cool, and basically to see where it was headed, we chased it down to the Huron River, and while we were chasing after it my neighbor tried to get it on film...the creepy thing about that was is that it didnt show up on the camera, all we saw was the red blinking tower behind it, so when we got to the huron river, we watched it, still moving slowly, make its way along the trees, we flagged down a car and asked them if they saw it and they said they were chasing it too, trying to see more of the ufo...we just watched it disappear behind the trees because we didnt have a lot of gas in the car haha;42.2256;-83.3959000000001
