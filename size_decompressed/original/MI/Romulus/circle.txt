It was just sitting there over the field.  I took my phone out to try and get a closer look of the helicopter and saw something I just could not explain.  As I video this on my phone no matter what I saw on my phone I could not see with my naked eye.  It was very strange.  I found out the next day that where I had filmed the UFO, which was toward metro airport I found out that the helicopter was there because Hillary Clinton was at the airport.;42.2256;-83.3959000000001
