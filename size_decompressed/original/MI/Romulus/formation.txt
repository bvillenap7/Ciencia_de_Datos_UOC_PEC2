I live by the airport so I'm used to seeing planes and lights.  But what I saw was a huge slow moving craft moving up an down.  Then pausing and staying completly still.  I felt like I can't look away.   Then I notice 2 small lights moving towards the stationary craft.  The move towards it and form a triangle.  They moved up down, then streaked off.  It was weird.;42.2256;-83.3959000000001
