Orange lights moving very quickly over Lake Michigan during meteor shower.;2012-08-11 22:00:00;2 hours on and off;Orange lights moving very quickly over Lake Michigan during meteor shower. I was photographing the meteor shower from the Lake Michigan shore line just north of Sagutuck with my boyfriend. After a some time staring at the sky we noticed an orange orb moving very quickly and in patterns I've never seen military craft move in. I say it this way because I worked on a aircraft carrier for a time and I assumed it was just military operations of some sort in a secluded location(the middle of lake Michigan south west of where I was at).  But after watching it dissapear over the horizon  and then reappear all the while getting brighter and larger made me shiver with a feeling of fear.  Up until then I thought I was watching the tail end of some rocket propelled something but when it appeared to move closer to me and get brighter I couldn't explain it.  It moved so quickly left to right and up and down on the horizon as if it was testing it's craft or just having fun.  I decided to photograph it three times, the first two times I set it up an! d focused only to have the damn thing dissapear.  The third time I just moved the camera and shot. I didn't zoom in and my shots are 30 secomd exposures but I have orange streaks moving under a patch of clouds far off on the horizon.  This experience was strangely frightening and entertaining.  No human could have been in those orbs and survived the movements. If its drones why make them bright orange and fly them around a dark wide open area at night?  I know statistically there has to be other life forms out in space but do they really come here.;42.6481;-86.1671
