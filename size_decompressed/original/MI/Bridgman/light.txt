Amateur radio operators are well aware of recent sun spot activity, as it affects short wave communications. On Tuesday, March 17 a CME struck Earth producing the largest geomagnetic storm of the current solar cycle.  Aurora was visible all the way down to the central United States.  The planetary A index for the day was 117, an incredibly high number.  http://www.arrl.org/news/the-k7ra-solar-update-366  A ham operator decided to have a look at the northern lights.  Weko Beach, Bridgman, Michigan, offered an excellent view of the northern sky.  An excellent photographer this person took a series of relatively high resolution photos of the aurora with his Nikon D7000.  Can get probably get the exact camera settings, nomenclature and lens info if you need it. Rough coordinates for the Weko Beach (public) are: 41° 57' N 86° 45' W.  If you like I can get the exact coordinates from a signpost on the beach. As the ham club newsletter editor and friend, the photographer sent me two of several photos taken.  They are: DSC_7510.jpg 8.6mb 17Mar15, 22:20 local time (EDT). DSC_7525.jpg 9.1mb 17Mar15, 22:32 local time (EDT). Zoom, ?x. As a UFO buff, I saw an unidentified string of lights in 7525.  Reminded me of the Phoenix Lights from a distance.  Looking back at 7510, I believe there's a barely visible thin black line in the aurora that I can't explain. BTW, the orange in the foreground seems to be light (perhaps moonlight) as it reflected off of the sand covered ice mounds at the Weko Beach shoreline.  The somewhat annoying lights are DC Cook nuclear plant flood lights. Installed after 911, they have destroyed the ambiance of the night-time experience along this part of the Eastern shore of Lake Michigan.  Another price we pay for defending against terrorism.;41.937;-86.5561
