String of lights over Lake Michigan off of Bridgman nuclear plant.;2015-03-17 22:20:00;12;String of lights over Lake Michigan off of Bridgman nuclear plant. A ham operator decided to have a look at the northern lights. Weko Beach, Bridgman, Michigan, offered an excellent view of the northern sky.  An excellent photographer this person took a series of relatively high resolution photos of the aurora with his Nikon D7000.  Can get probably get the exact camera settings, nomenclature and lens info if you need it. Rough coordinates for the Weko Beach (public) are: 41° 57' N 86° 45' W.   If you like I can get the exact coordinates from a signpost on the beach. As the ham club newsletter editor and friend, the photographer sent me two of several photos taken.  They are:  DSC_7510.jpg 8.6mb 17Mar15, 22:20 local time (EDT). DSC_7525.jpg 9.1mb 17Mar15, 22:32 local time (EDT).  Zoom;41.937;-86.5561
Quick ufo sighting at night bridgman michigan;2020-07-08 23:00:00;5-10 seconds;Quick ufo sighting at night bridgman michigan Was sitting outside smoking a cigarette as usual.  I will state that at one or another time I have seen what i believe to be strange things but never anything that was too crazy.  Well anyways me and my girlfriend were outside on my back deck (we live on the top floor of an apartment building) we see a light start to come across the sky.  I only have a fair amount of area to see but its not a small amount though.  It comes from our left the direction im facing is west. It blinks a white to possibly blue light a couple of times then it turns off its light and accelerates itself and i would say it actually switched directions but I could have percieved that wrong.  But it accelerates itself multiple times like it would speed up then slow down for a second then speed back up.  When it switched directions it came over top of us towards bridman headed east it was high up and pretty much invisible unless you could could see the outline of it in the clouds.  My girlfriend saw the light i saw it when the light when out i could see an outline of it and i dont know for sure but it kind of had a cicular shape to it  in the clouds but before i knew it passed over the building i ran outside but it was gone.  At least i couldnt find it anymore.;41.937;-86.5561
