We were 15 miles north of the Michigan Indiana state line and approximately 1 mile east of Lake Michigan. We saw in the south sky two oval shaped objects that appeared to be communicating with each other. The objects were approximately a mile apart and 1-2 miles high in the sky. They were hovering perfectly still and glowed as a very dim orange color. After 4-5 minutes one of them moved off at a casually leisure pace (southward) and turned off its lights. The other one hung around for a few additional minutes with its lights still on (still glowing) and then moved off in a different direction inland from Lake Michigan. Its lights then went off. Both crafts glowed dim firefly plasma like color (orange);41.937;-86.5561
