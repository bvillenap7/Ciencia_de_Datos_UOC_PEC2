Me and 4 other friends were in my backyard around the fire. They were all talking about stuff while I was leaning back in my chair looking for shooting stars. Out of the corner of my eye, in the South sky, I seen a slow moving light at first I thought it was a shooting star but realized it was a little bigger and changed from red to orange to white in a matter of seconds. It looked as though it was enflamed, it shot out something that from our distance looked like a spark at the same time one of my friend shouted out obscenities in disbelief. We seen it go under a cloud as it shot sparks two more times each about a half second apart. then it abruptly slowed down and sped up to where we it suddenly disappeared. The object left a small flaming tail but was too low in my opinion to be space junk. It was an almost perfect triangle with rounded edges. it was heading between south and southeast and only lasted a few seconds. I am reporting this because I honestly cant think of anything else it could be.
