one bright round light with 4 moving fashing objects;2004-01-31 23:00:00;still there;one bright round light with 4 moving fashing objects Coming home from dinner my wife noticed a bright light in the sky that she thought was a airplane. As we drove we noticed 4 other flashing objects moving in the sky and changing directions. The objects from the ground appeared to all be in the same area as the bright light. When we got home,about 3 miles later, the bright light was still in the same place and just one of the four flashing moving objects could be seen. It's almost 24:00 now and within the last half hour the bright light has moved west a long distance and is still visible.;43.974;-83.9381
