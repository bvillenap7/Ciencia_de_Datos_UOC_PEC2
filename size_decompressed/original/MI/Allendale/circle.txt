Small circle shape emits objects in sky, moving in sync;2017-03-29 23:30:00;15 minutes +;Small circle shape emits objects in sky, moving in sync At about 11:30 at night I was outside trying to see the Northern Lights with friend of mine.  While we were staring up at the sky, I noticed a small circle moving around with a weird light aura around it in weird pattern.   After about 5 minutes of watching it move through the sky it emitted about 2 other objects.  These objects moved around in sync with the main one I first saw.  They would then go back into the first one and then they would be emitted again and come back around 5 minutes later.;42.9698000000003;-85.9212000000004
Silver circular craft with white lights.;2020-09-02 23:00:00;2 minutes;Silver circular craft with white lights. I took video of an aircraft flying low. It is circular/ oval with blinking white lights that flash at random intervals, both at the same time so its completely dark. It stays dark for different amounts of time and has no rhythm to the blinks. I've seen it on 3 seperate nights, same place. It appears silver and flys in zig zags, up, down and backward.  It flew over a cell tower and the tower lights got dim until it passed.  It doesnt have sound.;42.9698000000003;-85.9212000000004
