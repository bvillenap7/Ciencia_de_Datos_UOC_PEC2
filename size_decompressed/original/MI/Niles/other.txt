3 extremely bright lights all in a row hover above trees on side of road, move, then come back, then take off in seconds.;2004-04-26 21:30:00;2 minutes;3 extremely bright lights all in a row hover above trees on side of road, move, then come back, then take off in seconds. My Daughter and I were driving home. Immediately when I turned onto the road, we saw something hovering in the sky. It was about 40 or 50 feet above the trees, right on the side of the road where we were driving. It was 3 extremely bright lights, all in a row close to each other. I could not see the craft itself because the lights were so bright in front of it, but I would say the lights were on 1 craft and not 3 seperate ones. The lights were not shining straight ahead, or pointing straight down at the ground, but kind of in between. They looked like huge spotlights and illuminated the sky and trees all around it. The lights were white. I pulled over on the side of the road to watch it. After about a minute, maybe a little more, it moved a few blocks west pretty rapidly, still at the same height. Then came right back just as fast to the origional location. When this happened, I got scared and put the car in gear to drive again. As I was doing this, It flew south and up higher and was out of sight within 4 or 5 seconds. There was no sound from it at all. I know other people had to have seen it. It was above houses and it would be hard to miss such bright lights out your window. Another car behind me pulled over and watched it too. A truly amazing sight to see.;41.8202000000001;-86.2403999999999
I saw a black line crossing the face of the moon.  The line covered approx 5% of the visable moon.;2016-01-23 18:09:00;~4 minutes;Just throwing this out there, at approx 6:09pm eastern time january 23rd, 2016, my wife and i were driving home from niles michigan to dowagiac michigan.  I noticed that as the full moon inched above the treeline, the moon appeared very large.  I made comment about wanting a telescope to view it.  Minutes later I saw a black line crossing the face of the moon.  The line covered approx 5% of the visable moon, refrencing the moon to a clock, the line began at 10 o'clock and move toward the 4 o'clock position.  The front of the line was rounded.  i pointed it to my wife.  She stated that from the angle and its position it was not a powerline.   We watched as we drove, the line completly crossed the moon's face and seconds afterward the tail appeared moving from 10 o'clock to the 4 o'clock position.  The line remained straight the entire time and moved in uniform speed. As the tail moved away from the moon's face it disappeared.  My wife and i began rationalizing what we just saw trying to explain it away, but could not.  A few minutes later, the line reappeared at the 1 o'clock position.  The size had not changed and the angle it traveled across the moon face was the same.  This time it decended from 1 o'clock to its original position between 10 and 4. It only covered the right half of the moon during this transit.  When it reached its original position between 10 and 4, it exited via the 4 o'clock position. Once we lost sight of the silhouette second time, it never returned.;41.8202000000001;-86.2403999999999
