A light that stopped the shot off.;2014-03-02 22:00:00;5 minutes;a light that stopped the shot off. One light looking like a star going smoothly across the sky to the west.   It suddenly stopped and stood still.  Then shot off to the north and up.  Then suddenly vanished.;41.8202000000001;-86.2403999999999
So I am 14, so obviously I still live with my mom.;2015-01-19 18:00:00;Not very long;So I am 14, so obviously I still live with my mom. last night I was doing my daily chores, dishes, laundry, trash, ect. but when I went outside to take the trash barrel up from the curb, because I hadn't done it that morning.  I saw flashing lights in the sky, and normally I wouldn't believe in supernatural activity, but when I saw the green, red, and blue, flashing lights.  I knew what I saw.  It definitely wasn't an airplane, or anything of that sort, because I would've been able to hear it.  This spherical figure in the scy was abviously not from this planet, or whatever. before I could take out my phone it was gone . The same thing happened when I was about nine, I was in my back yard in the winter, sledding down my hill, and as I was going down I saw it, the same thing I saw yesterday, in the same spot too. at the time, I didn't pay it much mind, because it was there for a while. and I remember it vividly. until yesterday I never really thought too much about it. this morning I was talking to my little sister, Meadow, ( Seven ) about it, I asked her if she had ever seen anything like it, and what she said shocked me .. Oh you mean my friends?  They always watch me play!  I told my mom, my dad, even some of my teachers, and they all thought I was crazy.. maybe some of you have hade similar indecents? please text me/ Call me;41.8202000000001;-86.2403999999999
there was about 30 lights about  mle apart.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-18 10:00:00;15 minutes;Last night me and my girlfriend were out looking at the stars and we saw an odd thing it looked like there was about 30 lights about a mile to a mile and a 1/2 apart going from West to North East consistently went on for a about 15 minutes  One of the lights separated from the others and went in a totally different direction.  It was like a conveyor belt we would look and another would appear move across the sky and fade off.  At any given time you could see 3 to 4 moving thru the sky at once.  Always the same distance apart.  Never any blinking or flashing happened;41.8202000000001;-86.2403999999999
