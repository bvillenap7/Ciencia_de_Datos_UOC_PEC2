Large circular orange light flying across the sky.;2013-06-03 23:20:00;3 minutes;Large circular orange light flying across the sky My husband and I went outside to watch nearby fireworks, and I noticed an orange light that didn't appear to be a firework as it was not moving.  I then asked my husband what it was and he replied it could be a helicopter.   Then we both noticed that it started moving across the sky with no sound and no other lights which we thought was a bit odd. Living close to an airport you get to notice small details which might get missed.   My husband and myself watched the light which blinked twice move across the sky at what looked to be a high altitude until it was out of sight this lasted 3 or 4 mins.   There was only 1 object of the shape and size in the area at the time it was bright orange and didn't move like a regular aircraft.   There were at least 3 regular airplanes in the area at various altitudes. From our location the object looked to be about 1 mile away.;41.8202000000001;-86.2403999999999
