While we were in her back yard with aour dogs after lunch, I spotted 2 cylinder-shaped UFO's traveling East toward Dowagiac, Michigan.  As they went into a big cloud a group of 10-12 small spheres came out of another huge cloud.   At first we thought they were birds but they were way to high up to be bird's.  As they came closer we realized they weren't birds they didn't have any wings.  They were silver and sphere shaped moving in formation going northwest.   We watched them for about 15 min until they were to far away to see them clearly.   My mom had never seen anything like that in her life and would be watching the sky from now on.   I wish I would've had my camera with me.  Hopefully someone got a picture of them.;41.8202000000001;-86.2403999999999
