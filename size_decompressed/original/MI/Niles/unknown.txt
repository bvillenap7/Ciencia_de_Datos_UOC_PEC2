Slow moving object is joined in pursuit by another object, a plane of sorts, with a blinking light and then the solid light leaves.;2014-09-15 22:00:00;5 minutes;slow moving object is joined in pursuit by another object, a plane of sorts, with a blinking light and then the solid light leaves. Soon after my birthday, my mom and her friend went to Mexico, leaving me home for a week by myself.  as I often have knee troubles I decided to soak in our hottub outside.  my girlfriend walked inside to get us something to drink and my cigarettes, and I leaned back and say a steady light.  at first I thought it was a plane since it had a light on it, but then I noticed it wasn't blinking.  I watched it go from almost directly overhead to about a 65 degree angle at low speeds. (assuming 90degrees is straight up.).  However the oddest part was the accompaniment of a aircraft that had a blinking light that caught up to it. as the second aircraft caught up, on this clear night I watched the solid light object go from 60degrees to around 45 degrees at a much higher speed than the blinking light could.  it left it behind and they never caught back up to eachother.  my only problem is I didn't know till recently that only military aircraft in a wartime zone could change their lights to off or not blinking otherwise it was mandatory to have signal lights.  the light was a solid white orb. not very big, but was about 2x the size of the blinking aircrafts lights.  I couldn't tell if the object made a sound or not seeing how the other aircraft did. but I know it didn't change color didn't blink just kept moving slowly then quickly.;41.8202000000001;-86.2403999999999
15-20 lights in the sky.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-26 22:00:00;15-20 seconds;15-20 lights in the sky 15-20 lights the size of the planet that is very visible in the western sky, moving southeast in an extremely straight line but all lights were not evenly spaced between each other. The speed of each object was the same and they travelled at the same speed as a fast moving airplane. The one that led the line faded away as if going into a cloud but it was a perfectly clear night with zero clouds. After the lead light faded away the next one in line then faded away. Every light seemed foggy despite it being clear outside. I ran into the house to get my phone when there were 15 left, when I was ready to take a picture there were 7 left.;41.8202000000001;-86.2403999999999
