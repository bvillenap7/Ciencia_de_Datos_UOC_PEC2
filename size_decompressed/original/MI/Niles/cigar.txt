Bright light, cigar shaped, two sets of wings, little sound just at dusk over my farm.;2006-12-15 17:30:00;about 7 min.;Bright light, cigar shaped, two sets of wings, little sound just at dusk over my farm. I first saw a very bright light to the west of me high in the sky, so I thought it was venus or another planet.  Then I noticed that there were thick clouds and I couldn't see any stars, etc. I watched as the light came closer and was coming directly over my farm. It was an extremely long round shape, like a cigar. Wings straight out that looked too little for the long craft. Behind the first wings were some square shaped ones with the corners cut off.  There was a space between the first regular wings and these wings.  Then a regular tail, with center part straight up and the two parts on each side, not swept back or at an angle. As it got almost over me I noticed two smaller lights on both wings, they were not bright at all.  It was so round and long, that I thought if there were pilots in there, they would have to sit behind each other.  I did hear a sound, but don't know if it was a jet or props. No sonic boom. It looked to be a yucky green /gray color..Coming from Chicago area and traveling west.  I have looked at over 700 photos of airplanes on the internet and haven't found any that match this.  The closest to it is the U 2 spy plane.  But, it didn't have the bright light in the nose of the plane like this one.  Why would they need such a bright nose light. Also their wings were longer.  This happened right after they gave up loooking for the mountain climbers in Oregon, so I thought it was  a heat seeking plane? I saw no other lights. Since I can't find this plane: thought perhaps you could help me figure out what it is. Can't get it out of my mind. so wrapped up in looking at it, didn't think to get my camera.
