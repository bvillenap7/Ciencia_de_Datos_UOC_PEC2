Orange light/fireball low to ground then moving.;2007-07-20 22:45:00;5 minutes;Orange light/fireball low to ground then moving. My husband and I were driving on M46 East towards Alma when I spotted a fireball just above the road, completely stationary.  I asked my husband what it was to which he repied I have no idea. He pulled over to the side of the road and I opened my window to get a better look.  The fireball was now slowly traveling upwards and South West.  My husband got his camera out of the back seat and tried to take video but by the time he got the camera ready it was too far away to capture the object properly.  It was not completely round nor was it flashing, but orange and did not fade. It was too close to the ground and stationary at first to be a plane, and since it did not fade away or flash, it could not have been something floating away from someones fire.  I have no idea what it was but the fact that it was pretty much hovering over the road was terrifying to me.  It did not start moving until we pulled over.  We tried to take a video of it with our camera but by the time my husband got it out the object was too far away to look like much of anything on film.  Are orange fireballs/light objects a regular observation??;43.4156;-85.0286
