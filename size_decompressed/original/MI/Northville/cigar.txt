Ten twinkling lights moving across the sky, and then two cigar shaped lights moving after them.;2017-05-08 22:15:00;2 minutes;Ten twinkling lights moving across the sky, and then two cigar shaped lights moving after them. Looking west, we saw 10 twinkling lights just appear and move randomly about, but in a generally SW direction, sometimes moving slow and stopping and even disappearing and then reappearing, sometimes moving very, very fast - as if a swarm of twinkling lights were playing together.  After they disappeared, two very large cigar shaped ships appeared out of nowhere with their front end glowing white and bright but not emitting light.  They appeared in a same general area as the group of twinkling lights and moved slowly in the same direction - moving together at a slow steady speed.  They were visible for about 45 seconds and then just disappeared. ,We are used to looking out our big picture windows all the time so we know plane and helicopter patterns and movement.  These lights were nothing of this world.;42.4243879746837;-83.4820411392403
