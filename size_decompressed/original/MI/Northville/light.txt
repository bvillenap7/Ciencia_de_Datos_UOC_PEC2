Orange light witnessed going across Michigan night sky, not an airplane, not a firework, something else;2013-06-22 02:00:00;2 minutes;Orange light witnessed going across Michigan night sky, not an airplane, not a firework, something else I have always looked for strange lights near my home as I live near Detroit Metro Airport and Ypsilanti Willow Run Airport.  Often I see what starts off looking like lights only to wait a minute or less and then see the tell-tale blinking lights of an airplane.   On this night I saw an orange tinted light coming what I thought was straight toward me, and I waited to see the red and blue blinking lights, only to watch this orange colored ball of light, the size of a small airplane light,go across the sky. It went on a straight path around 5,000 feet up and just flew until I could only make out a small tiny light far off to the east.  The orange light once faded to almost whitish orange then went back to a deeper orange color and stayed that color, keeping in a very straight path until it dissipated from my view.  It was not an airplane, it was not a firework as it was windy and this seemed to be on an intelligent controlled path very straight.  I wish there was someone else there to witness what I saw but I am positive about what I saw, I do not drink or do drugs and was clear headed and had my glasses on with excellent vision ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
