Circle craft flies over-head with bright light, Turing off my vehicle.;2015-06-27 23:45:00;35 seconds;Circle craft flies over-head with bright light, Turing off my vehicle. During a late night summer drive, around quarter to midnight, I was driving westbound on Galbraith Rd toward Wildcat Rd in Croswell, Mi when all of a sudden, the radio got very fuzzy and unclear until the power in my vehicle seized. At the same time, an extremely large circular craft flew over head illuminating the farm fields on either side of the road for at least quarter mile. It flew ahead from behind me and accelerated past with ease before making an instantaneous right turn following the shape and direction of the road. After the craft passed, my vehicle immediately regained power as if there was no problem. It was similar to the affects of a mild EMP.;43.26;-82.6235
