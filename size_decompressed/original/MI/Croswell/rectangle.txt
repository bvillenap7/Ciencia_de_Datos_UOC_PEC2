It was rectangular in shape and may have had lights on the side.;2015-08-04 18:27:00;Half hour;I left a friend's house around 6:30pm and was on my way home, when I saw something in the sky.  I stepped out of my car to get a better look but it seemed as if I had only watched for a minute, before it shot up into the air.   It was rectangular in shape and may have had lights on the side.  I imagine it was pretty big by the size of it.   After it took off I got into my car but when I looked at the time it was 7:00pm.  I felt as if I only saw it for a minute, but I had some how lost a half hour of time.
