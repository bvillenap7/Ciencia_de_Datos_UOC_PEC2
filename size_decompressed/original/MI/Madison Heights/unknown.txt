possible aurora aircraft sighting?;2005-06-21 22:00:00;20 minutes;possible aurora aircraft sighting? my friend and i were standing in the parking lot of madison heights Meijer talking and at about 21:55 i happened to look up and notice a jet that was way to high to be a comercial airliner producing a vaport or mist trail. i remember remarking to my friend that this seemed rather strange. as we contiuned to talk i began to look around the sky and noticed a number of other large jet aircraft producing contrails forming a grid like pattern in the sky being that it was a clear night and there was a full moon or near full moon we could see this quite well. then all the aricraft cleared the area and the vapor trails dispersed into a big obscuring cloud it was so think you could actually see the corona from the moon and all other stars in the sky were completely obscured. then at aporximately 22:05 we saw a very high set of flashing lights mooving very very rapidly there was also a jet airliner that was below the contrail cloud flying at cruising altitude we could tell this by the lights on the plane. the craft producing the lights was flying what appeared to be 3 to 4 times higher then the passanger aircraft and was above the vapor cloud. this high flying craft had a set of silver flashing lights at each end of it and was traveling so fast it made the passanger jet look like it was standing still. both the passanger jet and other craft were in the southern sky the passanger jet was flying south west while the higher craft was traveling west to east. the higher craft executed a turn and actually appeared to accelerate. then it turned into the moon light my buddy and i lost sight of it and then looking north over the store we saw the craft again heading north east. we also heard a series of low rumbles.;42.5029;-83.1021
