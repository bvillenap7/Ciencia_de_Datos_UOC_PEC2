White disk traveling east then immediately reversing direction along the same path.;2021-07-01 21:15:00;5min;White disk traveling east then immediately reversing direction along the same path. My wife and I were standing in the driveway talking at about 9:15pm when we noticed what at first looked like maybe a private aircraft. It was in the SW sky heading Easterly, above the clouds, (which were reported at a ceiling of 30,000ft when I looked it up after) and making no sound. We noticed that the object was not an airplane but either a cigar shaped object or maybe a disk shape. It seemed to be a brilliant white but I don’t think it was illuminated. There were no blinking lights. My wife and I watched it travel for a min when it suddenly reversed its travel directly back along the path it had been traveling. It didn’t stop, or bank, it just immediately reversed direction. I started recording then and got some good footage, although not very long, as it became obscured by trees and cloud cover.;42.5029;-83.1021
