I was very young at the time of this sighting, only 6 going on 7, my cousin had just turned 8 and also remembers this incident.  I never reported before because I was sure it was a dream until he asked me if I remembered it in conversation recently. It was dark and we were having a BBQ and lighting fireworks at my house my mom, uncle, cousin and me.  My cousin and I were playing in the street on Brettonwoods (11 mile and I-75 area), while our parents cooked and drank a little bit.  At some point a very massive, circular craft was hovering above very close to the ground, at the corner of Brettonwoods and what I believe is Andover St. There were sparks coming from the craft and something dropped out of it, My cousin and I started screaming and our parents came running for us, ushered us into the house and continued to investigate.  The last I remember from there was looking out the window and seeing a bright light at the corner. My cousin remembers driving home later that night and his dad pointing out a large round light hovering in the sky above the expressway (I-75) in the Hazel Park/Ferndale area. Our parents no longer remember these events.;42.5029;-83.1021
Yellow/white orb hovering above I-696.  Slowly pulsating, not flashing.  No sound.;2013-01-10 19:00:00;8-10 seconds;Yellow/white orb hovering above I-696.  Slowly pulsating, not flashing.  No sound. Parking in front of our place in the evening.  Saw yellow/white orb hovering above I-696, just east of where I-75 intersects.  Slowly pulsating, not flashing. No sound. It is common to see news traffic helicoptors flying over the freeway, getting that traffic shot for the nightly news.  As soon as I saw it, I said to my wife, That doesn't look like a helicopter.  But the helicoptors are loud, have flashing lights, usually keep moving and are easy to identify. I am not into the ufo thing, so I just sort of shrugged it off as something weird and went inside.  Then I saw a story on the local news that other people in the area had reported seeing similar things. I grew up next to an airport and I have been an avid camper my entire life. I have camped all over the US, Canada and Europe.  In fact, I have camped a number of times in Death Valley and the Mojave desert.  Right near Area 51.  I have looked up into the night sky for hours and hours on end.  And I have never seen anything I couldn't identify, until now.;42.5029;-83.1021
