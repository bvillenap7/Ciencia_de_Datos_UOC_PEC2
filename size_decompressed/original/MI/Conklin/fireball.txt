Well it was a hot night and my mother was going to come visit the next day and me and my boys were cleaning house. I keep a trash can outside vehind the house to keep our plastic bottles. The boys were jumping around the house so i gave them each a plastric bottle to bring out back. As soon as i opened the door they both boleted out twords the back, I on the other hand stood in the door way looking up at the sky. We lived in the middle of a huge apple orcherd way out in the middle of no were so the stars are extremely visible at night. As i was looked up in front of me i see three orange glowing like fireballs traveling west they were pretty low just above the top of a pine tree that is in the yard. I noticed that there was no sound what so ever. In that instence i remembered my boys were out back so i ran back and told them to hurry and get inside, i have to say i was scared i then locked the doors and closed all the windows and shades and waited for my hus! bend to get home . The boys were confused at why i was closeing all the window but i didnt want to scare them so i tryed to stay calm.                                                                                   My husband at that time had taken a friend of ours to town wich was about 8 minutes away.  When he got home i told hin what i saw and he told me that on his way back from town he seen the same fireballs in the sky and he watched them until they disapeared. I dont know what it was that we both saw but i know it was something. I have had several experians sinse i was little and strange things have happend to me but this is still fresh in my mind and its amazing.;43.1494;-85.8538
