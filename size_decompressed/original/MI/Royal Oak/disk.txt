Looking up and to my right I saw a u.f.o. (I have never seen any thing befor or sense like that).  It was the sise and shape of a watter tower like the one on 14 mile Rd west of woodward.  It had lights that moved counter clock wise.  It made no nose nor was there any wind. It hovered over the gas station for about five mts then it moved south and hovered over over the church for about three or four mts then it moved west and hovered over the old fire station for about two or three mts and then moved west to the train tracks it havered there for about two mts then went south and was never seen from again.  A hellacopter may have been able to move like that but would have made noise.  the end. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Fat disc shape. 3 lights. One light was red. I think other 2 were green and white. Went in different directions and hoovered.;2016-09-03 00:00:00;5 minutes;Fat disc shape. 3 lights. One light was red. I think other 2 were green and white. Went in different directions and hoovered. 9/3/16 1am. 11 mile and main area in Royal Oak MI. Craft coming at me (north) with white lights but stopped and went east and hoovered. Looked like a fat disc shape.  3 lights.  One light was red. I think other 2 were green and white.  Than went backwards (south) and hoovered.  Than really fast to the right (west) and hoovered and than to the east again and hoovered and than to the west again really fast and I could hear a really shrill noise when it went fast to the west.  It did a few of these left and right and back and forth moves and hoovered each time.  I got my camera.  Took pic off the porch but I had my finger on the flash which is a poor feature of this camera but maybe that's a good thing.  Went to take second pic and it went behind trees and disappeared but I watched it for over 5 minutes. The picture just looks like a blur of gas since it was in motion.  I would say it was the size of a jet and at jet altitude.;42.504493150685;-83.1457041095893
