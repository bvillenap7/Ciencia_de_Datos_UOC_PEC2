Yesterday right before a severe thunderstorm coming out of the SW and headed toward the NE I was watching the cloud formations and a dark triangler shaped silhouette appeared just above the lower level of clouds. There were not details to be seen, it was more like looking up at a shadow! There was no sound. It appeared solid, maybe 25 to 30 feet wide at the base and maybe 50 feet long. It was moving directly east, not with the storm but across it.;42.504493150685;-83.1457041095893
Triangle with lights;2003-12-11 23:40:00;2-3 Min;Triangle with lights At around 11:40 pm Thursday December 11 I witnessed a tiangle shaped craft moving fron southeast to northwest in the Normandy and Crooks area Of Royal Oak Mi.When viewed from the front it appeared to be three lights in a line and were very bright, They were quite a bit brighter than normal aircraft landing lights and that is what origanally caught my attention. As it passed to the west of our position it had a triangle shape with the lights the tips of the corners and a red light toward the aft of the craft. As it was flying away from our position It had Three lights across the rear. It did not have red or green anticollision lights or any kind of flashing or blinking lights on It. I could not her any sound and It was the size of a 747 or C5 cargo plane. The area I was in is in one of the main final approach corridors of Deroit Metro airport and I am used to seeing a varity of aircraft at night. From Northwest Airlink Canidairs cr4 and bae 146's to md-80's and 747-475's and this craf did not resemble any of them. The closest planes this craft would resemble is the F-117 and B-2 Stealth bombers and their landing lights are only visable when the landing gear are extended. It could have been a plane that but I have yet to see one that looks like this one did;42.504493150685;-83.1457041095893
