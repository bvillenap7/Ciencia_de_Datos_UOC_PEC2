Strange, white balloon like craft over Detroit metro area;2006-08-13 11:30:00;1 minute;Strange, white balloon like craft over Detroit metro area Today, the sky is very clear and dark blue in Michigan.  At about 11:30am, I noticed what appeared at first glance to be a star in the sky.   Then I noticed that it was moving very slowly and stopping and sliding slightly left, then right and stopping in a very solid stopped position - hovering.  I was able to get my video recorder and capture close to 8 second of video of this before it slipped behind trees and out of view.  This object appeared to be very high in the sky, maybe 20,000-30,000 feet.  When I went back and reviewed my tape, I had a chance to have a better look.  This thing was white in color, not silver.  It almost had a shape of a hot air balloon, but it was definitely not, just this general shape, kinda like an ear syringe but thicker on the downward spout of it.  It was very round on top, then an appendage of some type down from the bottom of it.  Very odd.  The downward appendage seemed to angle off at the very tip.  No sound at all.  Not very fast, yet very deliberate moves and changed direction.  I want to mention that one hour later, there was one huge X shaped comtrail in the area of this UFO. Maybe airforce had been there to investigate?  Or Maybe since I was paying attention to the skies I just noticed what's always there.  If anyone else caught this or knows what it might be, it would be cool to compare notes.  My hunch is that it is some type of suveillance drone.  It did have a similar shape to those UFOs recently seen by airforce in Mexico though via infrared.;42.504493150685;-83.1457041095893
