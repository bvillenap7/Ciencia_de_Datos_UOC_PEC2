At first I thought it was a star or the planet Venus but Venus was in plain view in another part of the sky.  That made me curious to look at this bright “dot”.  After about 2 minutes of staring at this object sitting in the sky I noticed it was more glowing than just a bright light. Then suddenly it got bigger and brighter. NO SOUND! It went from being a little dot to what looked like a bright baseball size glowing light.  Maybe 10 seconds went by as this object got brighter and brighter and then just like that, it was gone.  No sudden movement, no right angle turns at ridiculous speeds.  It was just vanished. There were no clouds in the sky so it couldnt of been a planes fog lights. I wrote this all down on a piece of paper about 7 months ago and put it in my desk.  My girlfriend found it cleaning and is making me post this.

Two white lights follow along freeway;2013-07-24 03:30:00;30 minutes;Two white lights follow along freeway I was driving home from work after working overtime at a government hospital I work at when I saw two white lights following along the freeway.  I was heading east at 70MPH with my cruise control on at 3 am (it takes me an hour to get home).  I first noticed the lights about 3:30am to my left also going east at 70 MPH and a guess would be 2-3,000' high.  The lights were about 1 mile apart going the same speed and altitude.  When the freeway curved the lights did not follow the curve but went streight instead.  I stayed with them until I reached my exit.  Just white light like a star, no strobes or anti-collision lights of any kind.;42.504493150685;-83.1457041095893

It was motionless and it sat stationary in the sky until within about 5 seconds it faded and disappeared.;42.504493150685;-83.1457041095893
