Firey orange orb.;2015-09-26 21:00:00;15-20 seconds;Firey orange orb My wife and I were out in our back yard and my wife said to me, while pointing up what is that.  I looked up to see what was a fiery almost plasma like orange orb of light traveling in a straight line from East to West for about fifteen to twenty seconds.  It was completely silent.  We lost it in the trees west of us and by the time we ran out in the front yard we saw it for a brief period.  It appeared to be about twice the size of Venus and I estimate two to three thousand feet above us.  I had no real point of reference to judge its distance from us. Me and my husband were in our backyard having a fire and I looked up and saw a fairly large flying object with what looked like orange fire coming from the front and back of the orb shaped object.  It did not make any noise at all.  We followed it to the front of the yard and saw it for a couple more seconds and then it disappeared.   I have never seen anything like this ever.;42.504493150685;-83.1457041095893
