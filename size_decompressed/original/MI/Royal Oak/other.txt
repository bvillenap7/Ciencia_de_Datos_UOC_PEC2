Was driving at 14 mile road and Coolidge Highway. Saw a couple weird dots in the sky. Looked like a orange parking lot light but way up in the sky.  Next thing I know, there are 15.  All going in different directions (very slowly), going higher into the sky (assuming since the dots got smaller).  I FaceTime my son and trying to focus he was able to see 2 dots in the sky and as I tried showing him, they all started disappearing.;42.504493150685;-83.1457041095893
