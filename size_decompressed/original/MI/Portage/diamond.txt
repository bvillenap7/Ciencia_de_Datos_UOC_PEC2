Observed a high altitude object floating southward at around 2:30 on 9/14/10.  To high to make an identifiable shape as it seemed to constantly change shape, but best described as diamond shaped. As it came south it seemed to slow to nearly stationary before picking up speed and going east towards Battle Creek.  During the time I watched various high altitude aircraft pass beneath the object and all those were easy to identify as different types of aircraft (airliners, jets, planes landing at Kalamazoo's airport).  Best guess if object was possibly over 50,000 ft.  Object was either extremely white or silver metal reflecting the sun.  It's possible with the way the shape seemed to shift it could have been a weather balloon, but with the altitude it seemed to be at doesn't seem possibly that the human eye should have been able to pick it out.  Didn't have any ability to opportunity to photograph object.;42.1880465306122;-85.5923232653058
