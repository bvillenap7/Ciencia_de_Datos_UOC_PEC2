It was the night where you could see Mars outside. I went outside to see Mars, and when I turned around to go inside and saw two large and bright lights. Afterwards there was a very large ship that made a low humming noise. It seemed to be moving slowly. I went inside to get my sister, but by the time we got out, the ship and lights were gone, and there was no sign of it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.1880465306122;-85.5923232653058
