I thought they looked a bit odd for planes, but figured that was what they where…they didn’t seem to be moving at all though. I walked the dog around the block (our neighbourhood is tree filled so I soon lost sight of them), and by the time I returned home some 20 minutes later, 3 of the objects had disappeared, but 1 (highlighted in yellow above.)  remained.  My husband and I looked at it thru binoculars, and from up close it didn’t look quite as long, (probably due to atmospheric conditions) but you could see it had blue, red, and green lights that blinked in rotation. It seemed to have small beams of pale light radiating a short distance from the underside of craft. It remained in the same position until we finally went inside.;42.1880465306122;-85.5923232653058
