One bright fireball splits into two.;2015-07-24 22:00:00;5 minutes;One bright fireball splits into two. On the 24th of July, at approximately 10pm, I saw a light very much like this one: https://www.facebook.com/david.almestica.92/videos/410474715809947/  It was bright, like a planet.  It moved slowly from Northeast to Southeast.  I watched as it stopped, grew brighter and bigger.  Then it split into two and the lights moved quickly to the north.  The whole event lasted about 5 min.  It was the weirdest thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.1880465306122;-85.5923232653058
