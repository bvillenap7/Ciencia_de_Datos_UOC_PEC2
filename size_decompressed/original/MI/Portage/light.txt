Star sized lights;2008-06-11 03:00:00;1 hour;Star sized lights On June 11, 2008, at 3:00 am, I witnessed, what I thought was a star in the east sky.  It wasn’t, It was the size and brightness of a star, but moved erratically. It appeared to be writing in the sky.  It had a faint aura, and seemed to turn blue with a red light that looked to be rotating from time to time. I observed this for about 15 min.  At that time I saw what looked to be 5 smaller lights.  Blue in color, but very small compared to the main light.  The smaller lights looked to be discharged from the main light, 3 from the left side, 2 from the right.  I had my children come and witness this, we continued to watch it for another 15-20 min. At 3:30 I went back outside and at this time there where more.  All the same size, 2 in the east and 3 in the southeast.  All making the same movements of the above mentioned.   I’m not sure how to describe this movement except to say, it looked like it was making a symbol or writing, it reminded me of a bee going from flower to flower.;42.1880465306122;-85.5923232653058
Straight line of unevenly spaced lights moving from West-Southwest to East,  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-26 22:20:00;30 swc;Straight line of unevenly spaced lights moving from West-Southwest to East, disappeared in approx 30 seconds. We were looking at Moon and Venus.  A straight string of lights appeared under the Moon moving quickly from West Southwest to East.  We saw them for about 30 seconds.  They disappeared when they reach approx due South from our location.  At first I thought it was a vapor trail being strangely illuminated but that was clearly not the case.  The Ohio description from 4/8 was very consistent with what we saw.  We didn't have time to count.  Objects were in straight line but unevenly spaced.  Tried to film with phone but were not successful.;42.1880465306122;-85.5923232653058
