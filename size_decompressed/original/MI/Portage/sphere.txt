Silver Sphere weaving in and out of a contral;2005-05-05 14:00:00;30 minutes;Silver Sphere weaving in and out of a contral At approxmently 2 in the afternoon, I was looking at the planes streaking across the sky making contrals when I noticed a bright silver ball in the sky. This ball was weaving in and out of one of the contrals.  I watched this for about 30 minutes, it then flashed brightly once and in the blink of an eye, it zipped away towards the south at a great rate of speed.;42.1880465306122;-85.5923232653058
Round yellow object escaping from storm;2008-06-08 15:30:00;40 seconds;Round yellow object escaping from storm My husband, sister and I were all standing outside facing North watching a storm come in. It was quite windy with large clouds, and the sky was becoming pretty dark quickly. I was the first one to look Northwest when I saw a perfectly circular yellow object, with bright white light surrounding itself heading east. I pointed it out to my sister and husband. We observed the object moving perfectly straight through the air. I thought it may be a balloon but it would have been moving sporadically, and this was not. We watched as the object continued to head east and then  all of a sudden it turned to head south, the only direction that still looked clear and unaffected by the coming storm. I'll never forget the event, we live right next to an airport and I love watching the different planes and jets come and go, and this was nothing like anything I had ever seen.;42.1880465306122;-85.5923232653058
round yellow metallic object flew near my house just before thunder storm.;2008-06-08 15:30:00;30 seconds;round yellow metallic object flew near my house just before thunder storm. My wife her sister and I were outside on our back deck watching the clouds as a large storm rolled in. My wife then noticed a strange yellow round metallic object moving slowly just about a quarter mile north of us. We all watch it as it moved at a slow speed from west to east. After about 20 seconds it headed directly south at high speed and it was gone.;42.1880465306122;-85.5923232653058
Spherical, silent, quick, lit up from inside, left a trail.;2010-03-22 21:00:00;30 seconds;Spherical, silent, quick, lit up from inside, left a trail. Standing out on a deserted road, my friend and I witnessed a spherical object, that was lit up, moving very quickly. It was about 100 feet up from where we were standing, and made absolutely no noise.  It had a tail of light. It streaked down towards the city, moving much too fast to be some sort of human aircraft, and way too low, plus you would be able to hear the engine from that distance.  We only saw it for about 30 seconds before it streaked away.  It seemed to be able to stop very quickly and hover directly before hitting the ground, but didn't slow down, for it disappeared quickly.  It seemed to be lit up from the inside, glowing yellow.;42.1880465306122;-85.5923232653058
