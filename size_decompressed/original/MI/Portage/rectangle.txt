It did not make any noise.  After watching watching it fly by for about 15-20 seconds it took off with very fast acceleration keeping the same height until i couldnt see it anymore in the distant clouds.  It was very erie and seemed like a different power i didnt know man had the way it moved and also what is rectangle?  U.S. government needs to get better at flying their military vehicles if they want to keep them a secret.  Thisnis no lie,,, actually kinda freaked me out for a minute.;42.1880465306122;-85.5923232653058
