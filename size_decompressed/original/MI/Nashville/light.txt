Line of 8-9 lights emulating from a specific location in the sky.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-02-19 05:30:00;3-5 minutes;Line of 8-9 lights emulating from a specific location in the sky At 5:30 am while walking my dog in backyard, I noticed what I thought was a satellite in the northeast sky. As I watched it travel I noticed a 2nd light, then a 3rd, & so on until I counted 8-9 lights. All evenly spaced & traveling at the same speed. I looked past the location where I originally noticed the first light to see how far across the sky they were traveling. It appeared they were emulating from something where I spotted the original light. The lights appear to fall downward instead of propelling themselves. They were out in the sky quite a ways. If I had to guess, I would say they were out in the outer atmosphere. Northeast of my home would be Saginaw Bay Mi., Ontario Canada, then the north Atlantic.;42.5971;-85.1222
