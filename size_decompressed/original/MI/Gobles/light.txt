Bright  white light hovers over camp fire then takes off at high speed;2001-07-20 00:30:00;1 min;Bright  white light hovers over camp fire then takes off at high speed Two friends and I were roasting hotdogs on a small fire, near my home in Gobles Michigan. We noticed a large, round, white light hovering low to the ground. It was about the size of a full moon and very bright. We watched it hover for around 30 seconds to a minute, then it quickly shrunk to the size of a bright star and traveled east at high speed.
