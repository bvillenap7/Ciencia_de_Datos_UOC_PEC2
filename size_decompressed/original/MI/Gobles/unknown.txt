We watched this for a couple of minutes, trying to figure out whether it was really staying still or just some sort of illusion of not moving.  Suddenly it just seemed to zip quickly off in a small streak, and it was completly gone...no sounds or other lights, just nothing at all.  Not sure what we were looking at.;42.3711;-85.8542
