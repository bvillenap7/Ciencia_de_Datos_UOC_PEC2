It was about 10:30 pm. I was sitting on our porch watching a baseball game when I noticed a bright light outside the window. It was a very clear night, and the object was somewhat brighter than a star.  I went outside and obsereved 3 more, and the forth met them over the lake.  They made very quick turns at angles more that 90 degrees, but the straight lines they traveled in were very slow.  They then slowly disappeared behind the trees that were behind my house.;42.3711;-85.8542
