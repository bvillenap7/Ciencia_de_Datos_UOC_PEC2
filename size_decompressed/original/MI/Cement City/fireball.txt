I was walking home and on my way home I saw a shooting star which drew my attention to the sky.  As I walked and watched I saw this big streak of light crashing down from the sky.  The color of the light is the same as a bulb in the pitch black.  It appeared to be crashing due to the fact streaks of fire dashed through the trail of light behind it, which I realized was smoke.   After crashing at alarming speeds the object abruptly stopped and faded its colors to match that of a star with a red/blue ring around it.;42.0606;-84.3277
