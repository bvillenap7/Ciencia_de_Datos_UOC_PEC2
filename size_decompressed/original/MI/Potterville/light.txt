While driving down gresham hwy toward potterville me and my girlfreind noticed two bright blue lights over the town.  We turned left onto m100 to head into town as we watched these two huge blue lights while driving slowly down the road.   As we watched them all the sudden they were gone.  In less than a blink of an eye. weve lived in this town our whole lives and never have we seen anything like that in the sky over the town.   We are sky watchers everynight because for the past two years he have seen lights and orbs flashing in the sky and tonight to make things more weird when we got home around midnight we noticed a huge triangle of blue lights sitting in the sky.  That also disapered instantly after watching for atleast 30mins.  idk what is going on but something weird is happening around here.  for what or why idk.
