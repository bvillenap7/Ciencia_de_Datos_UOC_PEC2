Object was noticed post event in a cell phone picture.;2020-10-05 10:35:00;Unknown;Object was noticed post event in a cell phone picture. I went outside to take a picture of the building where I work, so that I could simulate a logo sign for the side of the building.  I took a picture of the building with my cell phone.  When I started to crop the picture to make it easier to work with I noticed an object in the picture.  It is roundish / oval shaped, and appears to be light grayish / blue and reflecting the sun on one side.  It was a perfectly clear day.  Unfortunately I had not noticed the object at that time, or I would have grabbed my camera.;42.639;-84.7342
