Intermittent flashing lights over citie of Warren, Michigan;2006-08-27 23:55:00;1 hour;Intermittent flashing lights over citie of Warren, Michigan Approximately 23:55 Sunday August 27. The sky was partly cloudy. I glanced up facing south for a moment and noticed a bright flash of light as if some one was using a photographic flash from inside or above the clouds. At first I just thought it was the landing headlights of a plane. Less than a second later there was two more flashes to the left and a bit south of the other flash. The flashes appeared to be beamed downward. Two more flashes appeared from the first location a few seconds later. Then two flashes from the other location, left and south. It almost seemed like they were signalling each other. The flashes were stationary and appeared brighter but more dispersed as the clouds thickened. As the clouds thin, the light was still bright but more concentrated like spotlight or camera flash. On two occaissions abeam of light shot through the clouds horizontally and travelled quite a distance. I tried photographing and videoing the lights but was unable to capture the scene. I also used binoculars but was unable to see any solid objects. This went on for more than an hour. I couldn't think of anyone to call to witness, the event at first. I noticed my neighbor was still awake so I emailed her. She came over to see what I was describing, but the lights had stopped. I thought it might be a reflexion of light from the city of Detroit but the the light was more concentrated from the center or above the cloud and seemed to widen as it got closer to the bottom of the cloud.;42.4940184210526;-83.0203980263158
