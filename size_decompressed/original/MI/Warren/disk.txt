DISC SHAPED OBJECT WITH BRIGHT WHITE LITES PULSING AROUND THE BOTTOM AND FEELING OF TRANCE STATE;1970-07-01 19:00:00;don't know;DISC SHAPED OBJECT WITH BRIGHT WHITE LITES PULSING AROUND THE BOTTOM AND FEELING OF TRANCE STATE WHEN I WAS ABOUT 10 YEARS OLD, I WAS IN FRONT OF A FRIEND'S HOUSE LOOKING FOR SOMEBODDY TO PLAY WITH. I FEEL I MAY HAVE LOST TIME BECAUSE OF HOW I FELT WHEN I FINALLY RAN HOME. I FELT DISORIENTED AND DO NOT REMEMBER HOW LONG I WAS LOOKING UP AT THIS DISC I SAW.  IT WAS SILVER/METAL IN COLOR AND SAUCER SHAPED ON THE BOTTOM.  IT HAD OBLONG SHAPED LIGHTS IN A CIRCLE FORMATION ON THE BOTTOM OF IT TOO. THE LIGHTS LIT ONE AT A TIME REAL FAST IN A CONTINIOUS CIRCULAR MOTION.  I REMEMBER WATCHING THE LIGHT GO AROUND IT SO FAST, AND WAS JUST STARING AT IT AND WAS IN AWE AT HOW IT WAS MOVING SO QUICK, LIKE A FAST PULSING MOTION. THE LIGHTS WERE THE MOST AMAZING COLOR OF WHITE AS IT WENT AROUND, BUT THE ONES THAT WERE NOT LIT WERE MORE OF A DULL WHITE COLOR.  I SENSE THAT IT MADE NOISE, BUT I DON'T REMEMBER HEARING A PARTICULAR NOISE.  AT THE TIME I WAS STARING AT IT, I WAS NOT AFRAID.  BUT WHEN I SNAPPED OUT OF IT, I SUDDENLY FELT AFRAID AND LOOKED AROUND ME AND IMMEDIATELY LOOKED BACK UP AND IT WAS GONE. IT WAS THEN THAT MY FRIGHT TURNED TO MORE ON THE TERRIFIED SIDE, AND I TURNED AROUND AND RAN HOME. I ALSO SEEMED TO BE ABLE TO FEEL THAT IT WAS THERE.  TO THIS DAY I FEEL SOMETHING ELSE MAY HAVE HAPPENED, BUT WHEN I REALLY CONCENTRATE AND TRY TO REMEMBER SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT THAT DAY, I START FEELING TO ANXIOUS.  I FEEL LIKE I KNOW SOMETHING ELSE, BUT CANNOT QUITE PUT MY FINGER ON IT, SO TO SPEAK.  I AM STILL LEFT WITH AN UNSETTELING FEELING.

Large UFO-13 Mile and Hayes area Warren, MI.;2001-09-06 21:55:00;5 Minutes;Large UFO-13 Mile and Hayes area Warren, MI. My friend and I were driving down Masonic when I first saw the two crafts.  They were distand and appeard to have three lights on them.  We continued home and they became larger.  I told my friend that there were two very odd looking planes in the sky.  We continued home.  The crafts got larger and larger.  When I was a block away from my house, one of the objects had vanished and only one remained.  It was huge.  We both got out of the car to look at it.  The object was circular and was tilted so that we could see an elliptical shape.  It was BRITE yellow-orange, and had three main lights on it.  The object had smaller lights around the craft that outlined the circular shape.  We watched it for a minute.  We herd no noise.  My house was nearby, so we then went back to my house to get my father.  I ran into my house and ran back out while my friend stayed in the car watching it.  My father wasn't home so I grabbed my sister.  My friend told me that the craft had dissapeared only moments before my sister and I had walked out the door.  It just vanished: it didn't move or anything.  The object appered to be low to the ground.  If I held my thumb and my pointer away as far away from my face as possible, the object would have been about two to three inches large.;42.4940184210526;-83.0203980263158
