floating orange cylinder of light, Warren Mi;2007-07-14 00:00:00;2 min;floating orange cylinder of light, Warren Mi On 7/14/07, at 11:45 pm, I was watching tv when I noticed what appeared to be a ball of fire in the sky.  I thought it must have been a meteor or something along that line.  So I jumped out of my chair and ran to the door to observe it.  On the way I grabbed my camera.  When  I opened the screen door I got a much better look at the object.  It appeared to be a cylinder shape  of transparent orange light.  The cylinder seemed to be in some kind of craft, which was heading from the east to the west (Lk.St.Clair).  It appeared as though someone was directing the light, like it was looking for something.  It was about a thousand feet high, and absolutley silent.  There were no other lights on the craft, and no way to see the shape of the craft. So I snaped off a photo.  As soon as the flash went off, the orange light moved like it was looking in my direction.  Kinda like someone moving a beam of light accross your eyes.  I got a bit nervous and jumped back inside the house.  But then I thoght I was being a bit silly and steped back out and took another photo.  By that time it was getting too far away to get a good photo, but I did get two photos of the orange light.;42.4940184210526;-83.0203980263158
a dot for the sake of interterrestrial communication;2008-07-30 07:00:00;appx 60 sec;a dot for the sake of interterrestrial communication In the morning sky, under a low ceiling of clouds, a dot, most likely intended for my viewing only.   I thought it was a crow really high up, and about a half mile off.  I observed it moving for about 20 seconds and it completely disappeared.  I thought I had just lost it in my field of view, so I kept looking and maybe 10 seconds later, it re-appeared, (confirming it as unidentified) moving in a different direction, for only a few seconds. I continued to look and it once more had a very ethereal re-appearance, which may or may not be attributable to a trick in the vision but given the anomalous nature of the event I have elected to mention that it showed itself once more very very short, less than 0.1 second, in a fast tight loop.  I had had some momentous dreams the previous night and this was directly after I got up, the morning sky was cloudy, but my mind was not.  It was clearly inexplicable, and quite intriguing.

THEY WERE BRIGHTER THAN ORDINARY MARKER LIGHTS IVE SEEN BEFORE. THEY WERE RED WITH A WHITE LIGHT INSIDE THE RED AND I COULDN'T SEE ANY SHAPE ABOVE THEM. THERE WERE THREE OF THEM, THERE THEY MAINTAINED A SMALL AND EQUAL DISTANCE BETWEEN EACH LIGHT WITH A DARK BACKGROUND BETWEEN THE LIGHTS. I TRIED TO DISTINGUISH IF THE LIGHTS WERE IN A FIXED POSITION OR MOVING BUT I WAS UNSUCESSFUL, IT WAS SMALL AND A LITTLE FAR AWAY. IT TRAVELED A VERY STRAIGHT LINE. THERE WAS NO OTHER AIR TRAFFIC IN THE SKY AT THAT TIME, AFTER TEN MIN. THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR COM. AND HELICOPTER FLIGHTS IN THE AREA. I COULD HEAR COMMERCIAL FLIGHTS ABOVE THE OVERCAST.;42.4940184210526;-83.0203980263158
Red glowing ball of  light seen over Warren Michigan;2012-07-04 22:30:00;2 minutes;Red glowing ball of  light seen over Warren Michigan My wife and 2 small children had parked our van in the lot of a local high school, to watch fireworks being set off in the surrounding subdivision.  My van was facing west and we had a clear view of the fireworks which rose above the houses in front of us. The sky was clear and there was no wind at the time.  My wife noticed a red glowing ball of light which was at about a 60 degree angle from us and appeared to be as high as the highest point of the exploding fireworks. At first we both thought it was debris still burning from a firework but it continued to glow.  It seemed to smoothly and slowly gain height, traveling in a straight line from the northwest to southeast.  I had rolled down the driver's side window to take a better look.  I did not see a flashing beacon or any other colors of light which are typically seen on aircraft.  The ball of light did not blink and remained a solid red color.  It appeared to be slightly larger than the size of a star.  It made! no sound and continued heading southeast until it just seemed to vanish.;42.4940184210526;-83.0203980263158
2 Bright Lights in the sky, weird movements.;2013-11-08 22:00:00;5-10 minutes;2 Bright Lights in the sky, weird movements I have uploaded numerous videos on YouTube in the past week or so showing what appears to be a bright light in the sky, it moves very slowly and at certain points in its movements it lights up brighter than a star,  i'm not entirely sure what it is but it's definitely not: an airplane, lantern, planet, star, satellite, helicopter. The way it moves around is not that of a helicopter, and i've never seen a helicopter light up that bright, ever. Airplanes can't move back and forth or in that close proximity to each other. Lanterns cannot move left to right, right to left numerous times without changing altitude. Planets and stars don't move around like that.  Satellites do not move like that.  My youtube video is here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGh86IMk68M  You can find 5 total videos showing the bright light, my most recent one I linked to you guys is probably the best I have.  Whatever it is, it looks beautiful and magnificent, especially seeing it with your own 2 eyes, the key points i'd like to highlight in that video above are:  Watch closely around 1:50 on the video, the 2nd light appears and they seem to be flowing in motion and fluently with each other.  Towards the end of the video 1 of the lights starts getting brighter for no apparent reason.  Thank you for reading, if you need any other information don't hesitate to contact me.  Note: If you could please e-mail me first before calling, if you choose to do so, that would be great.;42.4940184210526;-83.0203980263158
3 bright flickering lights travel across sky south to north.;2014-05-25 22:27:00;3 minutes;3 bright flickering lights travel across sky south to north Sunday, 05/25/2014, 22:27-22:30 EDT.  Warren, MI. Three very bright lights go by overhead, one at a time.  My 2 dogs were barking to go outside, so I slid open the patio door and let them out, and saw a single bright light through the tree's to the south.   At first I thought it was fireworks because some people were celebrating Memorial Day, but as it continued in a straight line from south to north and got past the tree, it did not act like a firework.  It moved smoothly in a straight line, much like the space station does, and appeared to be very high up, but that is just a guess because I have no reference point.   I could see no structure, just a very bright light. Brighter than Venus.  More like a magnesium flare type of brightness.  So bright the I saw prominent spikes of light from the central bright dot of light.  It was a pale orange, yellow in color, and flickered like a candle flame, from so bright that it looked like spikes coming out of it, to so dim it looked like a fading ember of coal.   As I watched it fade out to the north, I notice 2 more coming along the exact same path from the south.  They were spaced about 8 full moons apart, and repeated across the sky in the same manner as the first.   At first I was scared, but when they did not seem to alter their path in any way, did not stop, just kept going on their way, I was excited, but did not want to leave the scene to get my camera, because by the time I found it and came back out, it would be gone.;42.4940184210526;-83.0203980263158
These red lights were very bright in the sky over Warren, MI.;2015-09-06 22:12:00;5-6 minutes;These red lights were very bright in the sky over Warren, MI. Me and a friend saw four orange lights come from the northeast in pairs.  The pair rose from the horizon, pulsating in unison.  One light was farther away than the other, so its light was more faint.   The initial pair disappeared.   Then about 3 minutes later two more lights appeared from the northeast horizon in a similar formation and persisted for about two minutes heading northwest until disappearing.;42.4940184210526;-83.0203980263158

It appeared to be hovering over Detroit and I'm approximately 15 minutes North.  I noticed one of the three would fade out and the.  Move slowly, sideways until the light would din out.  I saw the second object do the same by one big light seemed to remain.  Afterward I noticed many unusual aircrafts around all night.  I was able to capture a short video .;42.4940184210526;-83.0203980263158
