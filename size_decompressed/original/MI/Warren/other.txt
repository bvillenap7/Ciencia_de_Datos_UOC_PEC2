Star burst object.;2016-02-22 23:45:00;45 minutes;I saw what I describe as a strange object in the sky skipping back and forth real fast then changing form from a brilliant blue pulsating light into a star burst object or similar to a firework explosion raining outward with multiple colors...the center remained a bright emerald blue sphere, with blue, red, white and green streams bursting from the top and bottom, then it transformed back into a bright blue emerald and repeated this process for 45 minutes. It was approximately maybe 7000 ft in the air, and moved back and forth in the same spot real quick.  I tried to get a video recording with my cellphone but it couldn't capture the image.;42.4940184210526;-83.0203980263158
Square with green and red lights, huge object and glowing so bright.;2017-08-09 00:00:00;3 minutes;Square with green and red lights, huge object and glowing so bright Looked like a bright light (white) but really big, so I was looking at it and noticed it moving toward me from south to north.   As it came closer, it was green lights down the middle and red lights on both sides, looked about 300 to 400 ft. above me and it was about 6 foot by 5 foot.;42.4940184210526;-83.0203980263158
Photograghed a strange craft shaped like a (#) 3 in the sky over General Motors Tech Center, Warren, MI.;2017-10-15 11:20:00;30-45 seconds;Photograghed a strange craft shaped like a (#) 3 in the sky over General Motors Tech Center, Warren, MI. Often, I sit to to take nature pictures, of any sort, at the back of my yard that overlooks a river and a beautiful woods on the other side.   This morning (10/15/17, 11:20 AM) I heard the whine of a large passenger airliner approaching from behind me.  This is not uncommon, as I am more or less on the flight path for planes landing at Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  But because of the whine, I thought it to be quit low, it was unusually low due to the very overcast sky.  As it passed overhead, I thought I should have taken a picture of it, just to do it and then erase it, though I didn't.  Then off to my right I saw what I thought to be a small bird fluttering along in the wind, a distance away, maybe a leaf, it didn't drop at all, must have been a bird?  If I had tried to photograph it I'd of been able to zoom in on it and be able to tell. A few second later, looking now of to my left (which 3/4's of a mile away is the General Motor Tech Center) I see what might be another bird.  Well, I'll see if I can find it in the viewfinder when zoomed in on and get it focused and get a picture of it.  It, due to its distance, looked still quit small and a little strange, like its wings were drooped downward kind of low. I took the picture, quickly hit viewer to see how the picture looked, zoomed in on it and it look very strange, like an number 3.  I then quickly pointed the camera to the north, then finding it again, took 4 more pitures. It looked like Number 3. It's hard to tell how how big it is, how far it was away and how fast it was moving.  My guesses are it was ¾ to 1 ½ miles away.  If it was ½ to ¾ of a mile away. Because of the time between the first picture and the second picture being about 30 seconds it was traveling at 30 to 50 mph.  If it was a half mile away my guess is it was 10 to 12 feet long.;42.4940184210526;-83.0203980263158
