Three glowing reddish-orange spheres changing to white lights;2013-10-10 20:32:00;45 seconds;Three glowing reddish-orange spheres changing to white lights While observing the International Space Station fly-over, my sister and I observed three opaque glowing reddish-orange spheres emerging from the southwest, approximately 35 degrees above the western horizon, gliding silently due north.  The orbs did not flicker, nor did we observe internal structure. They appeared one by one, following the same path with an approximate five second delay between each sphere.  They were about the size of a dime held out at armâ€™s length.   We saw the objects for about forty-five seconds. As the spheres continued on their path, our view was partially obscured by a tree.  However, looking through the clearings between the branches, we were able to see that they changed to a white light in the center surrounded by a colorless semi-transparent shell.  They disappeared in the west-northwest.;42.4940184210526;-83.0203980263158
Very fast moving bright star-like light moving from @ 25-30 degrees to the western horizon then abruptly disappearing.  Not meteor.;2013-10-13 23:00:00;1-3 seconds;Very fast moving bright star-like light moving from @ 25-30 degrees to the western horizon then abruptly disappearing.  Not meteor. There was a bright, star-like light that streaked from a position above the setting moon heading toward the western horizon.  The light went out behind a tree before it disappeared abruptly. It did not hit the ground / horizon.  There was no flame or typical 'flame-out' like a meteor.  It was moving very fast and did not dim too fast to be a plane, and no aircraft lights.
