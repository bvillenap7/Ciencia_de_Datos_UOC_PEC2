Only, because the eclipse wasn’t expected for us until around 3:00pm, and unfortunately my break ended at 2:30pm. Oddly, I didn’t watch the video until the following day, and what I saw was totally out of this world (pun intended).  I saw several white orbs with lights and a mist of particles or gases of some sort. But the most INCREDIBLE sight of it all was the circular Extraterrestrial Craft that darted out of the mist or gas.  It then made an abrupt stop, then what appears to be fire or lights come on or out of it, it then spins in circles for a few seconds and finally shoots off in a zigzag form at a speed that is totally unbelievable! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite sincere, in describing his sighting.  PD));42.4940184210526;-83.0203980263158
