4 lights close to horizon;2003-11-13 19:00:00;10 Min.;4 lights close to horizon In the south south west. There was one very bright light. Close to the horizon. The other 3 lights were around the bright one. They where still for about 8 min. As we were watching, the 3 lights flew towards the bight one. So smoothly it was very strange. We didn't see what happened after that. I hurried up & drove into our garage. When we got in the house, we looked outside to see one object bigger & closer to our house now. We could actually see lights colored red & green going around in a circle. This is the 4th time I have seen these lights. Nobody believed me until this night. The other 3 times It is always 4 lights in the same spot on the horizon, low & in the south south west. One night they where in the north north west. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the objects might have been advertising lights, but that is only a guess.  PD));42.4940184210526;-83.0203980263158
Bright 'stars' turn into UFOs and then disappear.;2010-09-22 20:30:00;10 mins;Bright 'stars' turn into UFOs and then disappear. I was driving my friend home around 20:30 on September 20th 2010. I spotted two extremely bright 'stars' in the sky.  One was on top, and the other was below it slightly off to the left. I found this odd because it was a cloudy night, and no other stars were visible. Also these were the brightest stars in the sky, and I have never seen two stars in that position, especially that bright before. They were the color of street lamps, a orange-ish, yellowish color. I pointed them out to my friend. I kept driving for less than a minute, than I looked back at them and I noticed the bottom star had moved. I told her to watch it and tell me if it's moving.  She started to scream and told me I needed to pull over and see this. So I pulled down a street just before 11 mile in warren MI.  The top star was gone and now this objected was moving away from where it used to be. It was a smooth triangle shape. There were three lights on each corner of it. The lights seemed to be! dimming in and out, but not really flashing. The top one was white and the side ones were light blue-ish and I think light reddish. The body of it was blackish. I could make out a black body because the sun wasn't fully set at this time. it moved north for about 30 seconds till the lights faded away and it was gone. I looked at the other star and it was dimming. What happened next was the dimmed light became the point of this object and then the whole body of it emerged, it looked just like the first one. It followed the same path and then disappeared in the same spot. At this point my friend was very shaken up, so I started to drive off and I saw another 'star' in the sky moving. It was moving around at a pretty steady but fast pace, but I lost sight of it in the trees. I'm not sure what I saw. I just want to know if anyone else saw what we saw.;42.4940184210526;-83.0203980263158

I was walking my dog 07/05/2013 and saw 3 orange lights not blinking in a triangle formation,  it was cloudy but spotty could still see through them, it was the only thing I saw in the sky and moved along slowly and just disappeared into the clouds, and then I saw it again for a second or two and it was gone no sound. I then saw it again a day later or two same thing, it was clear and some clouds, three orange lights in a triangle formation not blinking just moving silently and disappeared into the clouds, didn’t see it again, this was in the northern sky and I still look to see it every night , I’ve seen lots of planes at night , this didn’t look like a plane, and it wasn’t fireworks, I was thinking it could be someone playing with laser lights, I really don’t know.
