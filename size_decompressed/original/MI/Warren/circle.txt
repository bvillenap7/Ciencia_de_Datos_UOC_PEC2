circular luminous craft changes shape while being chased by two military jets.;2001-09-04 20:00:00;15 minutes;circular luminous craft changes shape while being chased by two military jets. i was driving west on i696 from roseville to warren mi. west being 9 o'clock. i saw a bright luminous circular object hovering over freeway at about 30 degrees. while this craft was hovering it became oblong while maintaining the same radiance of light. slowly another smaller circular object appeared. this oblect slowly moved to the larger object and then became one object again. after this happened the object resumed its fomer circular shape. again, with west being 9 o'clock i then saw 2 military jets from selfridge air national gurd base ( i presume that base asit is the closest). one jet clearly had the after burners on and was moving from the south up to this object. the other jet was coming down towards this object from the north. as i went under a bridge in the span of about one second the circular object had moved from due west to due south. this was truly amazing.;42.4940184210526;-83.0203980263158

I seen  a huge mass of bright rounded green lights just above and beyound the Speedway gas station on 10 mile and Mound rd. which looked like a group of radio antenna lights.  Suddenly the the lights begin to rotate clockwise.   Then I seen another bright light going up towards the mass of lights that had stopped rotating and started to go south.   I hurry up and stopped my car then I  jumped out running toward three other people whom were already there.  I asked them what are you looking at? U.F.O. was one man reply.  Now that I know I'm not alone and feeling crazy I pulled out my cell phone and turned the cam on.  I had just enough time to take one photo.  It was very dark that night.   All of the objects turned sharply eastward and began to move fast.  I hopped in my car to follow them but they just faded away.  Gone with the wind.   The very next day I went to where they might had landed, in a semi truck parking lot and I found something that looked like a very bright yellow smashed up pastry or something.  I was going to collect it but it was stuck to the ground as though it was glued there.   I've never seen anything like it before.  Now I keep my video camera with me wherever I go everyday.;42.4940184210526;-83.0203980263158

2 different moving white star like objects.;2016-04-14 22:52:00;10 minutes;2 different moving white star like objects. Looked up at the sky and noticed that in the distance I could see what looked like a normal white coloured star that was moving across the sky towards my direction (started South & Headed North).  It went directly over my house and kept going in a straight line, North.  As soon as it passed my house and I had to turn my body around to follow it, this fast moving star like object became EXTREMELY bright white for about 15-20 seconds and then went back to a normal brightness of a star.  I followed it with my eyes until it just got to far for my eyes to see.  This lasted about 5 minutes total. Two minutes later I noticed ANOTHER moving object in the sky that again, looked like a moving star.  This was moving in a completely different direction than the first one.(Started North&headed East)  It seem to have came out of nowhere and I watched it go through the stars that make up The Big Dipper and I immediately lost it after that when my visibility was limited due to a random cloud.;42.4940184210526;-83.0203980263158

She said its a UFO then we saw it get even closer and even faster. We were both surprised and scared.  The lights on the craft were blue and white.  We know this was not a plane becuase why would a plane look like a big black circle.;42.4940184210526;-83.0203980263158
