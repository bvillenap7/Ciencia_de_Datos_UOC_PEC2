It may have lasted 1 to three seconds. My first thought was lightning, but the sky was clear. My second thought was, someone had an extremely bright spotlight, but this was a pure white light. I walked to the front gate (my yard is surronded by a privacy fence)in time to see a rather large fireball with a long trail of sparks or burning debris and a long plume of smoke which lingered for about a minute or two. The last thought to cross my mind was a plane on fire and about to crash. The object appeared to be at 2 o'clock high and about 60 degrees to the northeast. The angle of entry may have been approximately 10 or 15 degrees. It may have entered over Lake St. Lair or just north of Windsor, Ontario, as I am only 9 miles west of the lake. I am curious to know if this was space junk or something else and if anyone else had seen this fireball also, would it have showed up on airport, or Doppler weather radar? I checked with the National Weather Service in Pontiac and an Astronomy website, but neither had any reports on that morning.;42.4940184210526;-83.0203980263158
