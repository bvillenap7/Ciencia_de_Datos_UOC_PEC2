We have a tent that has a screen ceiling so we can star gaze before going to sleep.  I awoke approximately 3:00AM  I was looking up when I opened my eyes I was looking at the tree capopy and tree line at the stars.  I noticed what i thought was a star it was alot larger than the other stars it was brighter too.  I thought it odd.   Then it began to move, very slowly along the tree line and I lost sight of it as it went into the thicker tree canopy.  It was a bright white ball of light it moved very slow it was very distrurbing I was afraid.  I just lay there almost unable to believe what i just witnessed.   I have never expierenced anything like that before.  I will never forget it.I wish i had grabbed my phone or woke someone up but it was such a quick incident.  Alas, it is whatever it is.I have never had any belief in UFOs or aliens prior to 2012, but after this incident and another my daughter and I had prior to this incident in Dec.2012, I have a much different opinion now.  We are not alone, there are others out there.  As unsetteling as that statement is, I know it is a fact. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));44.2152;-85.9603
