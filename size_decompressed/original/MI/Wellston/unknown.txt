I saw a bright light that was what seemed directly overhead of me.  It was as bright or brighter than Venus.   Thinking it was a supernova, I said to myself, Wow, a supernova.   And just like that, as if on cue or something, the light suddenly dimmed to were it was just barely visible, and I watched, almost dumbstruck, as it moved slowly off to the south.
