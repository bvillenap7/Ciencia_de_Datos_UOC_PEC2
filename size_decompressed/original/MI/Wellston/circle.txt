Glowning green ball in Michigan;2005-10-20 01:00:00;2 seconds;Glowning green ball in Michigan My wife and I were going to our cottage in Northern Michigan.  We were about 100 yards from our drive way when a green glowing ball the size of a tennis ball shot out of the woods.  It was slightly higher than the car.  At first it appeared as though it would hit the car.  I slammed on the brakes and we both ducked.  The ball continued across the road into the woods.  There was no arc to it's flight and it appeared to be under intelligent control.  The area is densely wooded and there's only a few neighbors. There has been other weird stuff in the area as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));44.2152;-85.9603
