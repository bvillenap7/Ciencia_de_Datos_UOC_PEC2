Lights on parade.  ((Spacelink satellites));2020-03-07 19:45:00;3 minutes;Lights on parade 5 lights, traveling in a straight line at an incredible pace spaced close together and evenly apart.  I saw a bright flash at what seemed to be the ending point, that is where the lights just disappeared - that is, they were well above the horizon and did not fade out of sight, they just vanished.  It is a crystal clear night with an almost full moon.;45.6106018181818;-84.4859545454546
