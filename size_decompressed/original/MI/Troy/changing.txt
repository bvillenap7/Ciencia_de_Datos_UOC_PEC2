Loud vibrating sound, two objects merged & then shot away so fast;1995-09-20 21:00:00;30 seconds;Loud vibrating sound, two objects merged & then shot away so fast This happened at an intersection around Big Beaver & I-75, at a stop light with my Mom & sister.  I was 12 & sister 10.   Stopped at light, all of the sudden lots of light & hovering over the street lights is a bright object.   I watched other people get out of there cars to look & the light turned green & no one moved, at the same time a loud, breathtaking noise started, my mom took off into the Farmer Jack parking lot.   Then I/we saw a second object after moving vantage points, two seconds later the two objects met together & in an instant flash were gone.  After, the feeling that we all had was crazy!!   For sure other people saw this and I would love to find someone else who was at that intersection that night.  We know what we saw that day 20 yrs. later.   I am a mechanical engineer & I know for sure what I saw that day did not come from this planet or this technology!!;42.575968115942;-83.1458550724637
