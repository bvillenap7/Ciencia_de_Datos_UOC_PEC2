I was driving to work along I-75 at approximately 5am with my window down and happened to look out the window and seen a bluish green ball of light take an upward flight seemingly from out of the city and quickly disappear within a matter of seconds.  It was too large to have been a flare and there was no smoke or sound, but it was off in the distance a bit and I was driving my vehicle. My window was down so I rule out a reflection.  It seemed extraordinary. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));42.575968115942;-83.1458550724637
Orange tinted orbs observed over Troy, MI (along with star-like light to the east) ((NUFORC Note:  Possible Chinese lanterns?  PD));2012-02-09 21:30:00;5 min;Orange tinted orbs observed over Troy, MI (along with star-like light to the east) Approx. 9:30 p.m. (+/-)  Noticed two orange tinted orbs. In the distance, to the east, I saw one orb approaching as if it were 1/2 mile away. It proceeded west across the sky from the east, with the path crossing approximately at Square Lake Road. (It would have crossed Rochester Road as well.)  The second orange tinted orb followed the same path about 5 minutes later. Height was approximately at 4 or 5 stories high.  (I viewed them from 2nd story.)  Reason I saw the orbs: I was watching the eastern sky due to a brilliant full moon, and very bright skies spectacular night. However, it was curious:  There were a star-like object in the east, about 3 to 4 inches above tree-line to the east I cannot determine how far away, perhaps a mile or two?   (There is no way to determine.)  The object does not seem to have been a plane because it hovered for 3+ hours I was checking it every half hour.  It would move up and down, and over about 3 inches every so often. The two orbs came from the same direction of the star-like object to the east. I do not believe the objects were Chinese lanterns, which was my first thought.  (I saw what I guess were Chinese Lanterns in this same area during early fall of 2011 a few neighbors saw them, too.  I observed about 4 or 5 orbs that night they all following a similar path, and seemed to be moving at wind speed they passed by about every 10 or 15 minutes.  The neighbors saw 21 of them over a few hours, so we all thought perhaps they were for a birthday celebration--with Chinese Lanterns.)   They did look like they could be floating paper bags of some sort, higher than tree level, but not as high as airplane level. At any rate, I explain the Fall 2011 suspected Chinese Lantern event for comparison purposes:  The orange-like tinted light orbs of 2/9/2012 did not look the same as the lanterns they moved faster, were detected much farther away, and had a more intense light. It was this evening that I googled orange orbs over Troy and discovered this website. Today, I read that others saw the orbs, so I have decided to report the event.  (I was trying to dismiss the event somewhat these past few weeks but the star-like light low in the east was quite intriguing.);42.575968115942;-83.1458550724637

Orbs moved from east to west at speed slower than airplane.  Unknown height, but much higher than tree lines.

Orange orb - Troy MI;2012-03-07 21:30:00;1 minute;Orange orb - Troy MI Saw the orange orb (again).  It went right over my house.  It looked like the underside was blurry/distorted orange lights that would occur if the lights were moving (or if more like fire).  I had the binoculars handy (from two nights before sighting).  With binoculars, I could see there was a short trail behind it.  (I had not seen a trail on other nights without binoculars.)   The distance was lower than an airplane, but much higher than the tree line.  It moved slower than an airplane.  Area - Rochester Road & Square Lake.
