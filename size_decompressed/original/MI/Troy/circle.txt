Eight orange round shape flying objects over Troy-MI;2012-08-07 22:00:00;5 minutes;Eight orange round shape flying objects over Troy-MI   On August 7th, 2012 at about 10:00 PM, I saw about 8 orange round shape objects flying over Troy, MI. Appeared on the east side, approaching toward west side, mid speed, no sound, two of them flied relatively low over me, I couldn’t estimate the distance. They passed me, and since I was driving  I couldn’t follow them any longer. I was a little nervous to stop and look back for them. I took a picture when they were distant, but doesn’t show much,  I turned my camera off, I didn’t expected them to come my way, and as they quickly moved, I didn’t have time to set my camera again. Next day, I pass the same street at about 11:00 PM, (Square Lake Rd & Coolidge)  I was looking for them again, I saw about 3 of them on my right (South of Square Lake Road) that day I stopped, I wanted to get a video but they didn’t registered very well. I still have a picture and the video.;42.575968115942;-83.1458550724637
Orange flame like orbs in the sky, turned triangular in shape and then disappeared.;2013-01-13 00:40:00;~2 minutes;Orange flame like orbs in the sky, turned triangular in shape and then disappeared. I was on my way home from work at the hospital where I work as an RN at approximately 0040 on January 13th, 2013.  I was on the phone with my brother from California and was turning East onto Big Beaver Rd. and then planned to turn right onto Rochester Rd. in Troy.   As I was turning East onto Big Beaver, I looked up at the street and traffic lights on that corner and noticed that there was a orange orb of sorts that looked like it had a flame in the center of it flickering just above the street lights and moving in a horizontal fashion at a slow pace.  I could not comprehend what I was seeing, so I turned into the parking lot and just parked to watch it.   At first, I thought it might be a Chinese lantern, but it was close enough to see there was nothing surrounding the flame like orb.  I then noticed a second one appear close behind it going in the same direction.  At that point, I told my brother that I was seeing something unusual and that I needed to get off th! e phone to try to video tape this. Very quickly, the two lights had moved very far away in the distance and a third light appeared.  The three lights got into a triangular pattern and looked stationary for about 30 seconds or more.   It was at that point that I had gotten off the phone, parked my car, and pulled out my iPhone to take a photo and then some video.  I regret that I did not have the ability to pull out my camera and start videotaping when these two orbs were closer to me!  I’m very upset that I did not just hang up on my brother and start videotaping right away.  What shows up in my video are the three lights in the distance, very high up in the sky in the triangular pattern.   As I was in the parking lot, there was a lot of light pollution from the parking lights, so I drove past them and parked again and got out of the car to keep videotaping.  At that point, the lights started to disappear one by one.  The entire incident was approximately two minutes in length.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.  There were other cars at that intersection during the same time, so I’m sure there is someone else out there who witnessed this.   After thinking about what I saw and going through all the possibilities, I’m convinced that this was not a Chinese lantern. To see it so close, move so slowly, and then quickly ascend and move SO far away so without any wind tells me that this is something else entirely.  The objects made no sound whatsoever.  The third one appeared only after the other two were high up in the sky.  Up close, they were almost organic looking in nature, and did resemble a flame of sorts, but not a flame.  That is the best way I can describe them, as I have nothing else to compare them to.   I did not see a metal object or disk.  It was simply this beautiful, natural looking orange/reddish light, gliding along. Ironically enough, once I stepped out of my car and started video taping, I heard police sirens in the distance.  Nothing has been reported locally, although some night prior, our local Fox2 News station did a report on lights in the sky that people in the metro Detroit area have been seeing.;42.575968115942;-83.1458550724637
Multiple red objects moving from west to east, very bright, very fast.;2014-09-06 21:49:00;05:00;Multiple red objects moving from west to east, very bright, very fast. Observed three red objects moving quickly from west to east, then veering southeast.  First object passed the position of the moon and turned, the next two objects turned before.  The objects appeared in the sky 60 to 90 seconds apart. The objects were traveling across the sky roughly 5x faster than commercial aircraft. All three were identical in shape - they were first seen as very bright red, and as they crossed they dimmed, completely the opposite of the light from a jet airplane flame.  The objects were observed by three people - a 4y/o grandchild, her 28 y/o mother and a 52 y/o father, both older people with college educations. We walked out and immediately observed the first light - there may have been more.;42.575968115942;-83.1458550724637
Bright white light bigger than a soft ball.;2017-10-04 06:05:00;20-30 seconds;Bright white light bigger than a soft ball. On Wednesday morning, October 4, 2017, at approximately 6:05 a.m. I had to take one of my three dogs outside on a leash due to major surgery he just had.  Normally, I allow them to go out by themselves because I have a fenced back yard. While the other two dogs were running around the back yard, the dog I had on the leash just stood in the middle of the driveway looking around.  While he was doing that, I was noticing how nice the stars were and the little dipper was visible.  The cold front had not moved in yet, but I did notice some light clouds moving in. Something caught my dogs attention and he started to walk down the driveway to the back yard. We were headed North on the driveway.  That is when I noticed a bright ball of light arcing from about ½ a mile from my driveway on the East side.  It was about 300 feet in the air arcing East.  Then it literally stopped for a few seconds in mid-air, and then flew straight up into the sky until I could not see it any longer. From my location the ball looked to be bigger than a soft ball and as bright as a led light.  When we all went back inside the house 40 minutes had already gone by. The 40 minutes that passed from us going outside and going back in again is confusing. Our morning journey outside usually lasts 10 minutes. After we went inside I heard a helicopter near my house.;42.575968115942;-83.1458550724637
