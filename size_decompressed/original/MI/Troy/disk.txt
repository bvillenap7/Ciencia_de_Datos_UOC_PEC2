5 invisible crafts.;2013-10-07 11:30:00;30-45 seconds;5  invisible crafts On October 7, 2013, at 11:30 am, I viewed at strange phenomena. I think a short explanation would be good first.  As you know when there is a bright light like a flash from a camera, your eyes react by seeing a black dot as you blink.  On that Monday as I looking into the western sky in Troy, Michigan.  I did not see anything unusual in the sky, but all of a sudden as I blinked I saw 5 black images that were left on my retina.  As I blinked repeatedly the image gradually faded after perhaps 30 to 45 seconds.   The 5 images were saucer shaped with a dome in the middle.  There were 3 on the left one above the other and 2 on the right higher and appeared a little larger then the others.   I could not determine speed or direction because they were imprinted on my retina.  As I turned my head the images would follow. As I said before I did not see anything but the black retinal images.  Almost as if they were so bright that I could not see them, or they were emitting a frequency just out of the visible light spectrum. It was very strange and has not occurred again, but I will keep watching.;42.575968115942;-83.1458550724637
