It was very fuzzy and sounded almost like a hurricane was coming off the coast of florida. I have lived here in Michigan for less then a year and so many of these things have happened. This is the first time I have seen what I have heard.  I probally saw these objects in my back window of my house at least a dozen times. I watched for at least 10 minutes and they periodically came back into view.  They were very high up and I would say as high as planes usually fly, the one's with the smoke following them.  I think these were ufo's but I don't know.  At the most I saw three but I know their had to be more.;42.575968115942;-83.1458550724637
