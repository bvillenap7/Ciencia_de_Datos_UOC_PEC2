UFO spotted in Troy, and Berkeley, Michigan.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of Venus.  PD));2017-02-17 20:03:00;>1 hour;UFO spotted in Troy, and Berkeley, Michigan. I am currently on Big Beaver and Coolidge. I started off in Berkeley, Michigan, which  is when I first saw it.  If I am traveling West on Big Beaver, near Coolidge, it's currently in the sky.  I would say its just North of Coolidge in Troy, Michigan.  I have been following it for over an hour.  It's just sitting still.  Every now on then I will see red flashing lights on it. Initially I thought it was a plane landing.  At first glance you can mistake it for a star, as well, but at some point you will notice red lights.  I have never seen anything like this, however, it's really freaking me out. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a sighting of Venus.  PD));42.575968115942;-83.1458550724637
