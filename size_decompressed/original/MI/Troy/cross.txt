At 9:15 I noticed an unusual light, apparently at very low altitude (my guess is between 500 and 2000 ft.).  It appeared to be red, almost flame-like, moving very slowly from south to north.  As it moved it seemed to slow to a hover, as it was almost overhead, then resume its leisurely motion.  After it passed overhead, it slowly began to curve to the northwest.  All of this took 1-2 min. and the object kept the same appearance.   Then, maybe 30 seconds later, the whole spectacle repeated itself.  A second slow moving red light followed the same path as the first one.  By the way, the original light was still visible, still heading very slowly to the northwest.  I do not recall if this second light did any hovering as it came overhead.  It did the same turn to the northwest as did the first object.  Then to conclude the event, about 30 sec. after the second light made its northwest turn, a third light identical to the first two came again from the south, following the same path and speed as the first two.  This one, like the first light, appeared to slow and hover for a few seconds as it came overhead.   Then it resumed its slow pace, turning to the northwest as the others had.   Their speed was so slow that I could clearly see all three heading single file to the northwest.   The sky was clear and dark with no moon, but several stars were visible to the west.;42.575968115942;-83.1458550724637
