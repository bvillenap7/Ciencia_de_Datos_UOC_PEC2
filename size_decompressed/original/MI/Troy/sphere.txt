Numerous large orange-red orbs moving in a straight line across the northeastern sky. We observed this on 11/5/11 at approximately 8:10 PM in Troy, Michigan, on Rochester Road near Square Lake Road. We pulled over to the side of the road and watched for 10 minutes as this continued, then seemed to stop. The objects were just above tree level on the horizon. They moved at helicopter speed in a straight line parallel to the ground. They appeared suddenly, travelled for some distance, and then disappeared suddenly as they reached the same point in the sky. Their path was roughly parallel to the Northern Cross star formation, which was further to the west in the northern sky at that time of night. For the most part, the objects moved in a straight line.  We first saw five in row.  One of them was slightly lower than the other 4, which were in a straight line.  The next group included three in a broad triangle pattern.  The rest came in smaller groups of 1 to 3 at a time with slightly longer intervals between appearances.  All seemed to move at the same speed across the sky along the same flight path. The blinking lights of an airplane were visible in the same vicinity.  However, we could not judge relative distance and do not know if the plane was close to the objects or further in the distance. We called the local police to see if anyone else reported this, but were told that no had as of 9:00 am on the next day.  This is a heavily travelled road in a densely populated area.;42.575968115942;-83.1458550724637
