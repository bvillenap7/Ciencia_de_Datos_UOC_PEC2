UNO Sighting in Houghton, Michigan, June 6, 2019   Around 90 minutes ago, I was in my living room and noticed that the sky outside  seemed unusually bright.  At first I thought the moon must be rising and causing that, but that was not the case.  The brightness was diffuse and I wanted to “pin it down,” so I locked my apt., which faces only east, and went outside the building to see if I could see a source in the western sky for the diffuse brightness. I immediately did see a source in the northwest quadrant of the sky.  It was a narrow strip of light, almost vertical but with a slight forward tilt of the upper portion, and a very slight curve (I believe) in the middle.  It did not seem to be moving.  It seemed to be just hanging there.  I stood and just stared at it for three or four minutes.  Then some clouds moved in front of it, and it appeared that it would be covered for quite some time.  It was chilly and late and I was alone, so I returned to my apartment and did not go outside again. Later, it occurred to me that there might be an internet site on which to report seeing something you have never seen before, so I called the phone number and spoke to a gentleman and he suggested that I submit this report.;47.1172999999999;-88.5535000000007
