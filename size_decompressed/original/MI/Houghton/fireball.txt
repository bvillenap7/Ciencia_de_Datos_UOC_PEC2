My roommate and I were driving past Michigan Technological University around 2:30am and witnessed a bright orange fire-like object hovering in the sky.  I could not tell how far away it was but it was extremely bright and sparked my interest.  I pulled over within a matter of seconds into a parking lot and we got out to take a look at the object. I had seen a Facebook post earlier in the day mentioning that there would be a few different planets visible tonight so I had figured that it might be a planet.  However, once we were out of the car we realized that the object was beginning to move silently but quickly towards the North.  Within a minute or so the object was so far away that it was no longer visible. It seemed almost as if the object had noticed the unusual behavior we were exhibiting, abruptly pulling over into an abandoned parking lot and quickly exiting the vehicle.  I got this feeling because how low and slow it was flying  right as we exited the vehicle.  It seemed to be slowly gliding at first and then its speed steadily sped up without any sound.  The object quickly got progressively dimmer and farther away until it vanished, almost as if we had spooked it.;47.1172999999999;-88.5535000000007
