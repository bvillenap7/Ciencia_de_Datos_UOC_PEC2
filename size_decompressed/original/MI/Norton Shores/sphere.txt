Two sphere like orbs, reddish-orange in color, were moving through the sky, originally we only saw one because of the trees and thought it was the planet Mars, but then the other one moved in our line of sight from behind the trees.  They moved away from us together and eventually disappeared, which took several seconds.   Within a 30-60 sec they reappeared!  Then they proceeded to move away again till they disappeared. This whole process took about 30-45 sec.  They did this 4 times as we watched!   I went in the house to get my phone and came out and then never saw them again!;43.1963;-86.2717
