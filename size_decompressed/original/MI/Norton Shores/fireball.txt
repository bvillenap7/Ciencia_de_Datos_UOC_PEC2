Lying in bed, at the above mentioned time or approximately at that time or slightly later, I was gazing up at the skylight just above my bed, when a very large lighted object passed directly over the skylight.  It seemed to be round diffused light with a tiny bright possible light source. It was very bright and seemed to be traveling at about the speed of what an airplane might be traveling when it was approaching a runway for a landing. Having only seen this object for a couple of seconds, I'm only guessing at its size and altitude.  It seemed quite low and I'd estimate its diameter to be the size of the length of a private single engine airplane. It had no defined edges as the edges were more or less glowing similar to what a bright light bulb might look like from a distance.  I live approximately 2-3 miles from the edge of Lake Michigan and the craft was flying from the East to the West which is the direction of Lake Michigan from my home.  Interestingly enough, and the reason for my filing out this report, someone that I work with saw something the same night down in the Douglas, Michigan area. Her discription was nearly identical to mind.  Same bright, large object moving from the East toward Lake Michigan. She also lives quite close to Lake Michigan.  She had another experience in the past, but I don't think that it was very recent, but it did involve a craft over the Lake Michigan area shoreline down in Douglas, Michigan.  Douglas and Norton Shores are probably 55 miles from one another.  I have never seen anything like this in my life and my first thought was that whatever this was was heading downward toward the lake. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));43.1963;-86.2717
