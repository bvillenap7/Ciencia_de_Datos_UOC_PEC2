Five orange colored lighted objects in Western sky;2014-10-10 20:15:00;10 minutes;Five orange colored lighted objects in Western sky Five orange lights were seen rising in the western sky.  The lights rose very quickly with individual ones disappearing periodically possibly due to cloud cover.  Two of the lights moved quickly in a southerly direction.   Then suddenly, the lights were gone.  The entire visualization lasted about 10 minutes.  I was able to get one photo using a 10 megapixel Nikon camera.  I zoomed in on two images in the photo and will send the it.  One object appears to be a red orb and the other a white cigar shape.   Another image showed a red and white cigar shaped object.;42.8194571743925;-83.2830006622524
