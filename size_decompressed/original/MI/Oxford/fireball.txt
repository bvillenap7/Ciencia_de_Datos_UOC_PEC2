Orange quiet fireball;2011-05-21 19:00:00;5-7min;Orange quiet fireball Husband and I were sitting on deck  heard what we thought was a helicopter looked overhead and in fact saw helicopter  but in far southeast saw orange light coming in our direction (I believe north west) before we identified helicopter we thought light was from copter but even the bright orange light  didn't look like lights we ever saw before.   we dont know what happened to copter but bright orange light went over us and continued at a pretty fast pace toward north east.   Thought it was hotair ballon basket on fire but there was little or no wind and overcast skies. Also no noise.  Then thought it was the space station but looked up schedule and it isn't suppose to be in our area until next week.  Also it seemed too low for satelite or anything else but a mystery to us ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
