Rectangular Orange object low in sky;2012-02-04 20:15:00;Within a minute or so;Rectangular Orange object low in sky Detailed Description of the UFO Event:  Around 8:15 pm, Sat. Feb. 4, 2012 rather low in the sky(below where most jets travel and above the tree line) in the north-eastern Oakland County, Michigan sky an orange rectangular-shaped object slowly moved without any noise in a western direction and then stopped. It appeared to be stationary while the star-like, orange light pulsated for a few seconds and then the light died out--without the object moving or falling from that point in the sky. However, a few seconds later, the UFO must have moved after the orange light went out, or another similar UFO did exactly the same routine because, the object reappeared and repeated the same cycle.   Total occurrences lasted only seconds--maybe a minute or so and then it was over.;42.8194571743925;-83.2830006622524
