It looked like a balloon on fire but as I watched the object I realized it was nothing normal.  The object looked as if it was on fire at first but as I watched it I realized that the fire might have been in the center of it. It could have possibly had a clear shell on the outside of it.  But as I began to watch it, it started to float out into the sky at a very quick rate . Before I knew it the object was so far away and it looked like just a little star in the sky. This object floated into the sky around 500 feet away from me and had disappeared into the sky in just around 1 minute. I have never seen anything like this before. I have lived in the same house for 13 years this could have definitely been a ufo. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to provide little contact information.  PD));42.8194571743925;-83.2830006622524
