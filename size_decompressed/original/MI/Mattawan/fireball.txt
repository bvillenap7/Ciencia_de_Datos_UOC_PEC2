Bright red/orange burning orbe floating above the trees.;2011-11-18 21:36:00;20 mins;Bright red/orange burning orbe floating above the trees. 11/18/11       21:36   Driving threw a neighborhood near our residence my girlfriend and I got out of the car to look at the stars.  We were watching this burning light in the sky right over the trees that did not appear to be a star.  It was to low and bright to be a star and there were no blinking lights to identify the object as an aircraft.   We continued to watch it thinking that maybe we would see it move either away or towards us so we could identify it, but when It did move it was vary fast and the color of a burning ball of fire,  and the burning light did not move in a straight line it was more of a curved zig zag movement.   I continued to ask her if she was seeing the same thing above the trees as I was and that I was not just seeing something that was not there.  She confirmed that I was seeing the same thing as she was.  When it passed over us there were no noises coming from the light.  I am intrigued by this and so are the others who have spotted this same burning light in our town.  We continue to watch the night sky hoping we can get another glimpse of this burning orange and red object that continues to surprise us every time we see it.;42.2453999999999;-85.7950000000001
