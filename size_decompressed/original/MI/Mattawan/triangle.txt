First craft apeared as if comming out from behind a cloud- though it had rained earlier, it was a clear sky. Craft had faint triangular outline, but visible metalic 'veins' that looked like catwalks in small sections. Metalic or crome tip to the caft-Cotpit? Water-drop shaped bulbs that glowed- strange orbic light. Matched the color of sky, except for slight outline and parts mentioned. Craft flew to the the east for a few seconds, then seperated into 3 craft, all matching same discription, only about 15/18 size. Object made NO SOUND. Disipearded as if behind cloud, but no clouds where in sky. Ran inside and experienced uncotrolable emotions, at one point breaking a pencil in normal grip. I have seen a strange light in the sky seven years ago, along with two other members of my family. Christian family, father is a Baptist paster.;42.2453999999999;-85.7950000000001
