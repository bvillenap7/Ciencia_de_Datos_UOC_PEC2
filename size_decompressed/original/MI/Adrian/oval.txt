Walking down my driveway, I observed a bright object off to the south of my house. It was well away from any natural obstruction, and the only nearby obstructions near myself was 1 small tree and a large dead one. The object moved off to the northwest at a leasurly pace. As it neared the area where it would be obscured by the smaller tree, I moved further down my driveway, breaking eye contact with the object for aproxx. 4 seconds. When I attempted to ovserve the Object again, I noticed that it had seemed to have vanished.Going back to my first vantage point and another, I still could not locate the object.;41.8993;-84.0402000000001
