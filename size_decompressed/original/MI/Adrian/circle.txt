Many circular objects moving fast frm NNW to NNE, random groups and spacing and no sound. ((Starlink satellites??));2020-03-03 06:00:00;~5 minutes;Many circular objects moving fast frm NNW to NNE, random groups and spacing and no sound. This morning, I was walking my dog about 6 AM and as usual I watch the sky for what jets are crossing as it makes me think of traveling and going on more trips.  I catch the blinking lights and then after they pass I hear the engine.  There were two this morning in their usual places, but then something strange happened. As we neared the end of our walk I looked up to the NNW sky and noticed a string of five lighted objects somewhat higher than the usual jet path, they were about equally spaced and at that height I can't say how far apart but moving faster than the usual jets I track.  They moved from NNW to NNE but that's not all! More and more kept coming out of the NNW, a string of 11 then a string of five again but widely separated and even more largely spaced apart and some in groups again!  I lost count after about 25 all originating from the same place and heading to the same place!  There were no blinking lights and no sound that I could hear.  The night sky this morning was not exceptionally clear so thinking satellites didn't seem really likely and it sure wasn't a military formation of jets being transferred from someplace.  It was strange but didn't seem threatening.;41.8993;-84.0402000000001
