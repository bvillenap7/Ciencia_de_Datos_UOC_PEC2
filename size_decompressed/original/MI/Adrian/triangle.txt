Silent black triangle moving very slowly about 75 feet off the ground.;2004-12-10 20:00:00;2 min;Silent black triangle moving very slowly about 75 feet off the ground. Driving down Deerfield Hwy, craft was 75 feet of the ground going very slow (5 MPH) with blueish lights on the bottom. The shape of the craft was like a triangle. The night was very clear and the craft blocked out the stars in a triangle shape. The main thing that stands out from this sighting in my mind is the complete lack of sound. This is my first sighting and I hope my last. Object was about the size of 3 cars. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD));41.8993;-84.0402000000001
The strangest thing that grabbed my attention, was that as it flew overhead, I could see up into it.  Like it had a glass bottom and I;2006-11-01 20:00:00;3 minutes;I saw a large, bright light.  I was talking to my friend on the phone at the time and told her the details as I saw them.  I was on a country road with no traffice and so I stopped the car and rolled down the window.  As the aircraft got closer, I heard no sound of an engine, even though it was flying fairly low.  It was shaped like a triangle, from below it reminded me of a fighter jet, but broader.  It had a blue light on one wing and a red light on the other.  It was going very slowly.  The large light was on top and to the front.  The strangest thing that grabbed my attention, was that as it flew overhead, I could see up into it.  Like it had a glass bottom and I could see light coming from inside, which was sectioned off.  Behind the larger aircraft and slightly above, was another much smaller one which looked like it was following the main one.  Then I guess I got a little scared and left. One other strange thing was that when I tried to use my cell phone a few minutes later, it kept beeping back at me even though I had a good signal and when I talked with a friend, it froze and wouldn't let either of us get out of it! I've seen them before, but never this close and so I decided to report this one.  I work at a daily newspaper in Hillsdale, Mich in advertising sales.  I had just left choir practice and was on my way home, so no...I wasn't drinking!;41.8993;-84.0402000000001

After about two minutes or so it appeared to turn faster than a normal aircraft in a northwest direction.  The lights had no flashing, last I knew there should be flashing lights on known aircraftâ€™s.  It lasted about four or five minutes then disappeared.  A passenger in the vehicle saw it as well, less baffled than I, she was the one who noticed the change in direction and confirmed to me that no lights were flashing and it turned faster than normal.  Both are amazed at what was seen and feel a little confused.  Definitely not any stars or a normal plane.;41.8993;-84.0402000000001
