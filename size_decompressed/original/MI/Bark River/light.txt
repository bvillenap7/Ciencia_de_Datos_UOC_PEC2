Red white light low in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Vega in the northwest sky??  PD));2012-05-21 20:45:00;2hr 23 min.;red white light low in the sky I have noticed tonight in the western/northern sky a light object not very high above the tree line.  This object has lights on it, but I canâ€™t get a good view of it with anything I got to look through.  Sorry not able to get a good picture.  I have always noticed an object in the southwestern sky about this same height.  I asked my son about the object and he said the same thing about it.  Could it be that same object that was in the southwestern sky?  It just so far apart from where is normally.  I noticed this object about 8:45PM EST and not at 11:07PM and it is gone!;45.6981;-87.2081
