Diamond-shpae object in the Southeastern sky, heading northwest at a underterminate speed.;1997-04-15 02:30:00;5 mins.;Diamond-shpae object in the Southeastern sky, heading northwest at a underterminate speed. At about 10:30p.m. on 04/15/97 my girlfriend and I were waiting for her ride to work. At that time we were starring at the sky when I noticed a diamond shaped set of lights headed northwest from our position. At first i didnt think it was a ufo until it veerd northward. My girlfriend is`nt the kind to believe in ufo`s, but she came to believe in what she saw that night. About 5 or 10 minutes later we saw it again, this time headed southeast, faster than the speed we witnessed before. About that time my girlfriend`s stepmother showed up and asked her to stay awhile longer to see the sighting we witnessed. After 10 minutes, it never occured again. The object (from our veiw) had 7 lights , one at the point and three on each side. I could not determine the size of what i call a wingspan, but if was to stand next to it, i am sure it was very large by comparison. My girlfriend eventually had to leave for work, but i still stayed to see the event again till late that nite(3a.m.) which did not happen.;42.4544;-85.5994
