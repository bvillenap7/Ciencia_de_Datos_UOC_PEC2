A dark and round, spinning object stealthly creeping across the evening sky;2002-06-21 21:10:00;5 minutes;A dark and round, spinning object stealthly creeping across the evening sky It was a hazy evening at dusk and I happened to look up at the moon, which was a little more than half full, I saw this small, very dark gray, round object to the top and left of the moon. It was about the size of a star. It was moving very slowly in a straight line, it was not making any zig zag movements. It seemed to be either fluttering or spinning or some kind of movement within itself. It was moving to the north northeast very slowly. So I called some other people that were standing outside at the time over to look at it also. There were 6 of us watching it. We knew it was not an jet or plane because we did not hear any sound from it and because of it's movement being so slow. It was not a bird because it seemed to high for that. We though about a weather balloon but it just didn't look like a balloon to any of us. So after about 5 mnutes I ran to get my camera but when I came back out to take a picture of it, it was gone.
