At about 10:30PM in Plainwell, MI near a small airfield a large group of friends (about 20 of us) witnessed a large circular orange light in the sky to the east.  We were all together for a forth of July party sitting around a fire.  One of us noticed the light and everyone turned to watch.  It was a bright orange light that initially looked like a spotlight or landing light from a plane.  We soon realized that the object was moving to erratically to be a plane or helicopter and there was no sound whatsoever.  It did not move much but was making small quick movements from side to side.  This went on for about one minute before the light gradually faded away and wasnâ€™t seen again.

Saw two bright orange lights flying extremely low and fast with no sound.;2015-11-04 21:30:00;30 seconds;Saw two bright orange lights flying extremely low and fast with no sound. My husband and I went out to watch the meteor shower and were laying in our lounge chairs watching the night sky.  We are used to seeing many comercial airplanes fly overhead and have also watched the ISS many times.   From the south we noticed a low bright orange light coming toward us.  My husband said that must be the ISS and I said that it seemed too low and too bright.   Suddenly we noticed a second orange light following the first.  They moved overhead in a straight line with no sound.  The light was not blinking and moved quickly through the sky.  I estimate that we watched it move north for about 20-30 seconds, until we could no longer see it.;42.4544;-85.5994
