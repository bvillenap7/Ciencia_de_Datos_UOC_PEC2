Five bright yellow orbs with red flare on each.;2016-06-26 00:10:00;45 seconds;Five bright yellow orbs with red flare on each. My husband and I go out at night on a regular basis and lay in our loungers to look at the stars.   It was ten minutes after midnight, when these bright glowing orbs came out of the southeast, moving northwest.  There were four orbs lined up following each other spaced evenly apart.  Extremely bright yellow center with a glowing red flare.  All the same size and looked identical.  We live in an area with a lot of trees so they disappeared beyond the trees and then we turned around and saw the fifth one that was much further back.  It looked identical and followed the same path.  There was no sound.  We looked for a structure that the lights might have been attached to but there was not.  The lights were independent of each other.  It is hard to determine the height but they were above the large oaks but lower than you would typically see a small flying airplane.   I am the same person who reported two orange globes back in November 2015.;42.4544;-85.5994
