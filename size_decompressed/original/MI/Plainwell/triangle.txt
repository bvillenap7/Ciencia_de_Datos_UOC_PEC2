My friends and i were just hanging around our yard at around 10:30p.m., i happened to mention to what i saw two nights before this incident. Since they knew i liked science-fiction, they immediately thought i was pulling their leg. My younger friend (of the two) was very reluctant to believe, but i stressed very strongly at what i saw was real. At that time we all started looking toward the northern sky, about 5 minutes later my younger friend saw what he believed to a low flying helecopter. Since we lived about 4 blocks away from the nearest hospital, we just thought a lifecare helecopter was getting ready to land. We watched the lights for about 10 mins. but it never got close to here the turbine engines or the hum or rumble of a approaching aircraft. That`s when we all agreed that we were witnessing a ufo, because this object never got close to determine what it was. What we saw was a bright light moving slowly at first then getting faster as it went in a southernly direction. We were pretty excited at what saw that at that time i turned to my left facing west to see the same object i reported before. I quickly told the others to look in my direction to see what i was seeing. This shape(triangle with lights) was coming very fast from the western sky. Quickly, my younger friend darted inside the house.My other friend and i cotinued our observation of the two or more lights and the triangle one for about an hour. This happened near a major highway that we lived near. After about an hour we could`nt see anymore activty in the sky.;42.4544;-85.5994
