Bright Meteor object Halloween night;2000-10-31 19:00:00;10-15 seconds;Bright Meteor object Halloween night On Halloween night while taking the kids around the neighborhood, my oldest daughter saw a meteor like object coming out of the North and brought it to our attention.It was a little before 7:00PM myself, my wife, the two kids and a neighbor handing out candy observed it. It was heading to the Southwest projecting a small tail of white fire. It was bright white and about 50 degrees above the horizon. When it reached the zenith of its trajectory, some part of it fell off like molten white hot steel dripping to the ground. I didn't see anything really unusual about it. I figured it was a meteor or space debris skipping the upper atmosphere. It disappeared about 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon in the southwest, which made me think it went back into space or burned up.;42.8235;-84.233
