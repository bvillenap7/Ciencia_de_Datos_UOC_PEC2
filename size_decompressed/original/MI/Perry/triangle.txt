Bright silvery-white triangles standing on end;2000-11-15 17:00:00;3 Minutes;Bright silvery-white triangles standing on end I 5:00 PM my daughter was in the backyard playing with the dogs, when she noticed two triangle shaped objects motionless in the southwest about 45 degrees above the horizon. One triangle was a few degrees higher and further away. The weather was mostly clear with two small clouds near the objects and a jet contrail running west to east. They were standing on their bases with the long point of the triangle pointing straight up. They were a bright silvery-white. She immediately yelled into the house for me to come out and see. By time I got to the back deck, she said they had disappeared like someone turning off a light. At the same time my wife was on her way to work in Williamston MI. heading south on  M-52, when she noticed one triangle setting motionless in the southwest sky. She described it as a triangle sitting on its base with the point of the long end pointing straight up. It was a bright silvery-white and a little bigger than a dime held at arms length. She turned west on Haslett road with the object still in sight, when it disappeared like someone turning a light off. The duration of the sighting was about 3 minutes.;42.8235;-84.233
