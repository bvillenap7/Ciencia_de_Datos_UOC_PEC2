Bright light in eastern sky increased in intensity, then turned red and shot off.;1999-04-25 04:04:00;10 minutes;Bright light in eastern sky increased in intensity, then turned red and shot off. I am a ex-submarine sonar tech working as a security guard while going to school to become a police officer.  Early this morning while doing my rounds I noticed a bright light in the eastern sky about twenty degrees above the horizen.  It caught my eye because in was moving too quickly to be an airplane.  It increased in intensity untill it was brighter than a planet looks.  It then turned red and shot north untill I could not see it any more.  This all happened over a period of only ten seconds.  I stood there for a few minutes And it came back in just about the same spot I had seen it before this time moving around for about a minute.  I could not watch for it any longer because I had to finish my rounds.  The second time I saw it went from a small dot of light into one as bright as a planet and about equall in size. The movement of the light was random, it would move in one direction and then go off at a 90deg angle.  It dissapeared the same way both times losing intensity as it changed to red in color and shooting off to where I could no longer see it.  The first light was at 0405 and the seconed at 0411.;43.0101;-85.7593
Shooting star changes course and vanishes from view.;2015-04-23 06:27:00;2 seconds;Shooting star changes course and vanishes from view. On my way driving to work, I observed in the sky this light.  I assumed it was a shooting star but there were no other stars out.   As I watched, the light seemed to veer off its course and vanish, as if it was leaving the atmosphere.  It wasn't traveling with the same speed as previous shooting stars I've seen in the past.  But faster than any plane I've seen overhead.;43.0101;-85.7593
