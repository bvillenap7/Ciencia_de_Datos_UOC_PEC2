Me and a friend saw a ufo;2001-06-24 10:00:00;15 Minutes;Me and a friend saw a ufo Me and my Friend were walking down his dirt road to a contruction site we ride are bikes. We got tired from jumping are bikes and sat down and just talked about stuff and he got up and i got up and i looked at the west part of the sky and saw a light and me and my friend watched it and talked about other stuff thinking it was just a plane or helicopter. I remember it was just in the air a good distance and looked like it was headed towards us only very slow then what made me and him wonder what it was was when it took a sharp turn to the left as if it just stoped and then went in another direction not turning then it went over the same direction it did when it went to the left and it went forward towards us and we rode are bikes up a hill to see it go over us and i got and good look at it before it flew over us and it was triangular but you couldnt see the body only three lights and they where a white, and a bluish color, and it was soundless we couldnt hear it at all and it wasnt that high. It was probley as high as a hot air balloon usally is. Then it flew over us just about 10 feet in front of us and a tree got in the way of our view and i swear it was only 3 seconds after the tree was out of our view that it was not any where in the distance and it was a clear night about 10:00 when we went home after that. I am a big believer in ufos and have been for about ever since i was 6 and i am now 18 and i heard about the 11 ufo sighting over mexico in march and it was just incredible to know that it had the backing of a united states official and it was declared a historic event and there was a sighting over iran just before that one with 8 ufos over iran in april. I also heard that ufoligist believe something truly amazing might happen this year so just keep that in mind.;42.6645411764706;-83.6063705882353
