2 Formations of Fireball Like Objects Witnessed and One Filmed 10 min...  ((NUFORC Note:  Please see similar report for this date. PD));2008-07-04 23:00:00;10 min;Two Formations of Fireball Like Objects Witnessed and One Filmed in 10 Minutes My wife, daughter and I were returning from the fireworks display held at Kensington Metropark on July 4, 2008. Traffic was snarled so it was about 11pm by the time we got back. About a quarter mile away from our subdivision we noticed a collection of 5 (maybe 7) orange flickering objects that some people might describe as a fireball. Curious, we pulled over to watch these objects. We were facing south and these objects were traveling from east to west. Their motion and appearance were uniform although one object appeared to weave left and right slightly relative to the formation and subsequently sped up slightly as if to return to the correct spot in the formation. There was no sound. I would not describe the formation as uniform or tight, just motion in the same general direction. As these objects passed overhead and slightly to our south their flickering began to fade and then disappear entirely well before they would have been out of our line of sight. It is as if the front of the object gives off the flickering orange light but not the rear. We could not see anything much more significant that a faint star once the flickering stopped. At this stage it was difficult to reacquire visual contact with one object if one focused on another in the group. We agreed these were not aircraft. There were enough aircraft flying overhead at the fireworks so we had a good frame of reference for that conclusion. Since neither of us could explain what it was that we saw, we decided that we saw unidentified flying objects. We drove home I carried our sleeping 4-year-old up to bed and began to unload the car. I noticed a group of 3 more objects traveling in the same manner and direction as before. This was about 5 to 10 minutes later. This time I was easily able to retrieve the camera from the back of the car and subsequently filmed this group of objects in a 30 second .avi clip (the cameraâ€™s limit). The video is thoroughly boring and by itself seems to do nothing to further identify the phenomena that we witnessed.;42.4804465373959;-83.4766265927979
Orange fireball over Novi, Michigan, in western sky.;2017-06-10 21:23:00;20;Orange fireball over Novi, Michigan in western sky. The object looked like an orange and yellow fireball appearing to travel downward and towards the north, towards the earth from my perspective.   The object was in the western part of the sky.  It had a tail pointing toward the sky at an angle of about 70 degrees from the horizon.   The object did not look like a plane, but more resembled a comet.;42.4804465373959;-83.4766265927979
