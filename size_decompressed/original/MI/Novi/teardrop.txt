3 Teardrop shapes in Sky;2009-07-04 22:30:00;1 hour;3 Teardrop shapes in Sky Started about 9:30 two balls of red moving in small patterns to the right of the full moon.  Disregarded as helicopters. About, 10:30pm returning home, to see closer 3 teardrop shapes moving in slow triangular patterns.   One would leave to the West and one to the East to meet again in the middle.  My husband and I are sure that they are neither planes nor helicopters. Pattern of flight was simple and slow.  Went to take pictures and they were gone.;42.4804465373959;-83.4766265927979
