UFOs over Novi, MIchigan;2008-06-21 22:45:00;2 minutes;UFOs over Novi, MIchigan At approximately 10:45pm EDT on June 21, 2008, my son and I were looking at the stars from our backyard. Suddenly, two bright orange lights approaching from the southwest caught our attention. As the lights closed in on us, one appeared to be slightly elongated vertically. Most if it was still a reddish-orange but there was some yellow near the top. One of the lights changed course slightly and headed in a more easterly direction. The other light continued to track NE directly towards us. As it passed overhead, it appeared to be a dark circular object. Its size was that of a half-dollar held at arms-length. Inside this circle were four equally sized small rings of individual red lights. These rings of light were symmetrically arranged around a larger central red light.  My son said the small rings of light changed color from purple to red. There was no sound as the object passed directly overhead. After it passed, it looked like a solid orange light again. By this time the other object was quite a distance from us and still heading ENE. Its light faded slowly until it was gone. The object that passed us continued to track true and steady NE. It slowly faded until it was gone. This object covered 20 degrees elevation in the SW to 20 degrees elevation in the NE in about 2 minutes. Iâ€™m a private pilot and amateur astronomer and have never seen anything like this.;42.4804465373959;-83.4766265927979
