It was leaving a very short double streak against a totally cloudless sky.  This was around 4 pm so the sky was exceptionally blue. At this point I noticed what appeared to be a cloud but it was completely round, and as the sky was totally cloudless this really caught my attention. While watching the “cloud” I then saw a point of white light at its center.  This point of light then zigzagged rapidly at about 45 degree angles after which it darted to the right (north) and went into a free-form looping pattern.  It then zigzagged again, and with the “cloud” not completely covering it there seemed to be a triangular shape that possibly the light was zipping around the edge of.  The light and its companion “cloud” then continued moving south, zipping, zigzagging and looping while moving across the sky until it went into the horizon and out of site.  There is an airport nearby but this object did not move in the direction of that airport. There was no sound and the weather was exceptionally good – cloudless sky, very little wind. Watching this object took my attention away from the jet so I don’t know where it went but it was not in the direction of the object(s)or the airport. I have never seen anything like this and with all the political stuff going right now– the debates, the primary vote, Flint’s water issue, the guy in Kalamazoo shooting people – it’s really freaked me out.  Could it be a drone?  But reports of those include sound and this was completely silent.;42.4804465373959;-83.4766265927979
