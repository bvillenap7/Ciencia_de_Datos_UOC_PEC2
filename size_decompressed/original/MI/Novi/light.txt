Bright green object moving north, north-west observed or suburban Detroit Michigan.;2001-06-09 23:05:00;3 seconds;Bright green object moving north, north-west observed or suburban Detroit Michigan. Observed a green light, about thumb-nail sized with arm stretched, moving north-northwest at a very high rate of speed.  Changed as it went to smaller and yellow, then smaller yet and white.  Did not observe any tail -- just the light. Interestingly, I heard a very loud sound, much like a jet aircraft reving up it's engines, about 5 seconds before this.  I did not see the jet, which is why I went outside to look in the first place.  No other jets were heard before or after.  Am located about 20 miles north, north-west of Detroit Metropolitan Airport. Conditions were apparently clear, but city lights prevented observing how clear it was -- stars not visible.  I suspect this was a meteor but figured I'd report it anyway.

Bright green light illuminates room at night.;2014-01-25 01:30:00;5-10 seconds;Bright green light illuminates room at night. Sitting watching TV w/girlfriend and our whole living area lights up with a bright green light. We live on the highest level (3 floors).  All of our blinds were open.  After the initial flash I got up to see what it was only to see the flash light up the room again.  Couldn't make out where it was coming from but it was beyond surreal and in no way normal.;42.4804465373959;-83.4766265927979
Red orbs moving west to east forming C and J formations.;2015-07-04 22:15:00;45 minutes;Red Orbs moving west to east forming C and J formations. July 4, 2015.  My wife and I viewed groups of unusual red lights moving across the night sky over Novi, MI, and other areas of metro Detroit on July 4, 2015.  The sky was clear and the temperature around 78 degrees with the usual stars in the sky very clear and visible.  No planes overhead either.  The neighbors were firing off fireworks as usual for the Fourth of July holiday. Our Aunt, who lives in Westland, about 8 miles south of us, called at 10:17 PM on July 4, 2015, saying she was seeing strange red lights in the north sky moving slowly and methodically from west to east.  So we went outside and looked into the south-southwest sky and saw a strange looking red light in the form of an orb or circle moving slowly across the sky from west to the east.  Then about 6 more started appearing, one at a time, in the same sky moving from west to east.  They moved slowly and then eventually formed a C like formation, but about 3 minutes later they moved into a J like formation.  After another few minutes the lights started to move towards each other and then started fading two lights into one.  Each of the six lights in turn moved to the next highest in the sky and the two became one and then the next one left doing the same thing fading into the next highest red light until there was only one red light left.  When there was only one red orb left it slowly faded away without any sound or exhaust.  I even used binoculars but they just appeared to be a bright red light.  They did not have any shape like a plane or helicopter and there was no sound coming from these red orbs. After this first group faded out or basically travelled to the east out of sight we went onto our back deck and observed more of the same in the north sky.  The exact same thing happened that we observed in the front yard.  One at a time, travelling from west to east they were bright red until eventually forming another C formation that eventually morphed into a J like formation in the north-northeast sky.  After a couple of minutes one at a time they started flying slowly into the highest light and each in turn disappeared into it.  When only the one red light was left, it slowly faded away and then nothing else was seen in the sky anywhere.  After the fireworks were finished by 11 PM the red orbs had stopped showing up.  It seemed like the red orbs were somehow trying to react to the fireworks going off in the sky.  But the red orbs were much higher in the sky then any fireworks that were fired into the sky.  The red orbs by the way they were moving must have been under so! me kind of intelligent guidance.;42.4804465373959;-83.4766265927979
