Yellow/orange objects seen over Novi Michigan.;2013-05-26 23:15:00;60 seconds;Yellow/orange objects seen over Novi Michigan My name is ((name deleted)) and on May 26th, 2013 at approximately 11:15 pm I turned into my girlfriendâ€™s driveway at ((address deleted)) Lane Novi, MI.  My vehicle was facing north, as I looked into the sky and noticed a pattern of approximately seven yellow/orange glowing lights (might have been triangular in shape) moving in an extremely slow unison.    These lights were in somewhat of an arrowhead pattern and as they moved in an east to west path, they slowly, one by one, started to disappear or dissipate from the pattern until all of the lights were no longer visible. During this time, I exited my vehicle and attempted to capture a photo of this unexplained pattern in the sky.  I was unable capture a clear image.;42.4804465373959;-83.4766265927979
