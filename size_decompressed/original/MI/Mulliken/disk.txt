These objects were not like the other meteors, they flew right to left, up and down before taking off at an extremely high rate of speed before vanishing. Myself -responsible, trustworthy, with no eyesight problems, mental abnormalities, well-liked My Friend-basically the same  Objects sighted-  4, singled colored disk shaped objects, each a different color (red, green, blue +yellow/white) that flew around in no particular formation, then forming a triangle (1 in front and back, two in middle) before taking off at an extremely high rate of speed, faster than any plane I have ever seen go in my lifetime.;42.7352;-84.9021
