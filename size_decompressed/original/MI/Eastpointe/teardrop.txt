Two golden/orange globe like objects moving very fast across the sky;2005-11-10 23:45:00;30 seconds;Two golden/orange globe like objects moving very fast across the sky As I was closing my garage door, I noticed how crisp and clear the night was tonight.   I love to look at the night sky so I decided to take a good look at the Orion constellation.   It was then I saw two orange/golden objects appear out of the mid-horizon and move from the east to the western horizon.   At first I thought it was a meteor because it was moving kind of fast.  But these two objects were moving in perfect unison and they sounded like that metallic owl from that Clash of the Titans movie.   Well, it moved over my head very fast, faster than a plane or a helicopter but maybe less than half the speed of a meteor in the sky, and once it got to about 2 to 3 o'clock in the western horizon, the globes disappeared but made a final birdlike sound about a 1/2 second after it disappeared.   Down by far the strangest thing I've ever seen in my life.  I've seen meteors, satellites, planes, helicopters, kites, balloons.... you name it.  But nothing like the perfectly moving fast anomaly in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.4658;-82.9459
