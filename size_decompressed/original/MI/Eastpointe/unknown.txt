My name is ((name deleted)), on the night of 5-27-16 from 11:05 to about 11:17 p.m., I witnessed a UFO.   I was working at my facility when I decided to step out for a cigarette.  Upon doing so, I noticed a blue light soaring through the sky.  I thought nothing of it, until I noticed it had no other lights.  Then the craft came to a dead stop.  Once this happened I called my co-worker outside to see what I was seeing. 	The craft stopped south west of our location.  I would say about a mile away from us, and hovered at about 2000 feet.   The craft began to slowly move and 3 orbs of light came out of the bottom of the craft and shot back up into it.   That seemed to start a sequence because the craft became a very bright red and began to descend in what seemed to be a smooth and straight line.   The craft disappeared behind the treeline by Selfridge Air Force Base, Mi.;42.4658;-82.9459
