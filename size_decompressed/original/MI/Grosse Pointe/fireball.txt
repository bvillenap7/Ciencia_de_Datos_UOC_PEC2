Orange Fiery orb looking object in the sky;2009-09-07 01:50:00;1 min;Orange Fiery orb looking object in the sky At around 1:50am me and 2 buddy's were walking to my car when we noticed a bright fiery orange orb (about 1/3rd the size of the moon) in the sky moving slowly and quietly heading NE towards Lake St.Clair.  There was in overcast at the time So this object was under the clouds. After about 30 seconds The object turned and started moving SW away from the lake, as it was heading SW the object picked up speed and elevated in the clouds until it was out of sight.  Where I live I see planes and helicopters everyday due to my location being so close to an air base and a city airport and what i saw was definitely NOT a plane or helicopter.   I watch the sky at night a lot when outside and am a firm believer in Extraterrestrial life.;42.4168640449439;-82.9040359550561
