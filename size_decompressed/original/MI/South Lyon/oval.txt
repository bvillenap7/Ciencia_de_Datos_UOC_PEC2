Bright reflection of sun in oval object. Disappeared;2011-08-05 12:15:00;30 seconds;Bright reflection of sun in oval object. Disappeared I was driving home from work and made a turn I make everyday.  Up ahead in the sky I see a bright reflection of the sun in what appeared to be a silver, metallic, oval-shaped object.   I continued driving and a tree (which was not very full) got in my sightline.  As I moved past the tree the object was gone.   I could not tell if the object simply vanished or shot away, as I did see some of the reflection through the tree.   I also could not tell if the object was moving or not while I had a good sight on it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.
