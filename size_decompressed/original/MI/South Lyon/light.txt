I have never seen anything move so fast across the sky. While we were walking my son around the neighborhood for halloween,I noticed a light in the sky. I said hey a shooting star! Everybody looked up to see it,but it didn't dissapeer.It moved as fast as a shooting star but didn't fade away.We watched it until we couldn't see it due to the tree line. Two hours later and more than amile away, my inlaws described the exact same thing.;42.4557;-83.6542
