They were round in shape and darted across the sky at about 3 o'clock off the horizon.   These lights stayed behind the clouds the entire time moving in an unusual broken circular  pattern.   The brightness or glow of these individual lights varied as they moved.  The number of observable lights varied during our viewing.   We thought this to be such an unusual event that we stopped our vehicle along the river road to watch this strange activity for at least 15 minutes.   We then prceeded South towards our destination and were able to keep the objects in view on our right side.   We maintained observation for about 20 minutes until we drove out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Initially, we accidentally listed this report for Canada.  We correct our mistake above, to reflect a sighting over Michigan.;42.6869;-82.5522
