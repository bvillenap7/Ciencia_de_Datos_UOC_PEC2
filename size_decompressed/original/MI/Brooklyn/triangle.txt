Orange & Red triangular lighted with no sounds.;2008-06-07 22:00:00;5 Minutes;Orange & Red triangular lighted with no sounds. Numerous witnesses at a campground in Brooklyn, Michigan.  Two occurances each lasting 3-5 minutes each.  The first occurance consisted of one craft flying from south to north.  There were no discernable sounds coming from the craft.  The craft looked like a very large fighter jet from behind as it had a large triangular shaped ball of flame that seemed to pulse and change in volume and color from orange to red.  The second occurance consisted of two of these objects flying side by side.  The first object was further north in the sky but all three were on the same trejectory.  The two objects side by side, did not change their positions, even minutely, as they crossed the sky.  The second occurance was, at most, 1/2 hour after the first.;42.107;-84.2392
