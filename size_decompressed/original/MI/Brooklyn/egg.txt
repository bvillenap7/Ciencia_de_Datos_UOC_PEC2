Three (total) egged shaped flying lights over Brooklyn, MI;2008-06-14 23:00:00;15-25 min;Three (total) egged shaped flying lights over Brooklyn, MI On the night of June 14, 2008, (I had no watch but I figure that is was around 11 -11:30 p.m Eastern) three unidentified flying objects were seen over the Brooklyn MI area.  At first, there was one object that was oblong in shape with a like fiery pale halo of yellow and an oblong center toward the “front” of the object that was more orange.  It seemed very large and low.  No blinking lights appeared and it vanished off into the distance after a few minutes.  It never paused.  About ten - fifteen minutes later, two more objects that seemed smaller (and maybe higher) but with the same description appeared.  They seemed to be together but did not always remain side by side.  There were more than 15 people that saw the same event, that I am aware of.  I believe the direction of travel was somewhat North to South. There was no apparent movement other than their direction of travel.  It was very strange.;42.107;-84.2392
