What i saw was flashing red light with a green pulsing light. the green light appeared to go around red light.  Thought maybe a plane when i looked around to see planes in the area the lights were definitely different.  The planes light changed as they moved due to the different angles seen.  The object or lights i seen had not moved.  I watched the lights for more than 30 minutes than they just disappeared.  I dont know what I saw but it was not an airplane or helicopter.;43.0761000000001;-83.8473000000001
