3 small white circling very fast in oval formation for 10 minutes.;2013-10-25 19:30:00;10 minutes;3 small white circling very fast in oval formation for 10 minutes While getting my mail at end of my driveway, I was looking out  eastward toward Flint, there were 3-4 white lights about 1 mile away moving very fast in a circle/oval formation through a thin cloud.  You could see the lights circling really fast  and in the same circle formation for 10 minutes.  At first I thought it was strobe lights, but then realized you cannot see the lights hitting the bottom of the cloud nor the lights through the air.  Just small white lights circling above the clouds.  Creaped me out!;43.0761000000001;-83.8473000000001
