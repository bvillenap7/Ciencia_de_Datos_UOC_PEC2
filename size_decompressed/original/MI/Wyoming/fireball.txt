Large fireball object size of full moon, changing direction, speed and brightness.;2013-09-19 23:05:00;90 seconds;Large fireball object size of full moon, changing direction, speed and brightness. As my roommates and I were standing on the back porch, we saw a large round fireball shape in the sky moving fast off too our east, moving south to north.  It slowed down and went dim, then it brightened up again and resumed speed.  It is the oddest thing I have ever seen in my entire life, the only logical description that I could think about would be a large plane on fire.  However the speed and changing of the light did not make sense.;42.9130234848484;-85.7051136363637
