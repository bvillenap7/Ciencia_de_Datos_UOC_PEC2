Shiny metallic sphere, between softball and basketball size, held still then moved very fast, completely silent;1986-06-20 13:00:00;30 seconds;Shiny metallic sphere, between softball and basketball size, held still then moved very fast, completely silent. This happened when I was approximately 16 years old, about 1987.  I was riding in the passenger seat of my moms s10 blazer and we were just about to pull into our driveway.  I saw this object motionless about 20 feet off the ground in a field.  It was a shiny metallic sphere, the size was between a softball and basketball.  It had no lights nor any features. It was like a polished ball bearing in appearance.  It was still for about 5 seconds then moved away very fast then turned and it was gone, it was completely silent.  It had accelerated faster than anything I have ever seen before. This was the middle of the day on a bright sunny summer day in Michigan. I've never seen anything like it since.

Orange sphere or orb;2012-04-14 11:15:00;2 minutes;Orange sphere or orb My wife and I witnessed an an orange ball over our house traveling south to north.  Appeared as if it had a flame behind..but no noise.  We are on the landing path to major airport and see planes all the time traveling west to east and can hear the engine noise.  This was around the same height (guess 3,000 feet) in the sky and was traveling I would say 300 mph (judged on planes).  But the orange glow was unusual almost like a flame trailing but again no noise.  We had seen the same type of object about a year ago traveling on the same course. After two minutes across our view point, it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.9130234848484;-85.7051136363637
