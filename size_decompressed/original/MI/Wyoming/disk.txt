Disk shaped looked to be black with colored flashing lights on the bottom;1994-03-10 18:00:00;1 minute;i was standing out my back door talking to my friend when i looked up and said what the hell is that   disk shaped looked to be black with colored flashing lights on the bottom slow moving west to east toward kent county airport followed a couple minutes later by apassenger jet.   my friend looked at me and said her job was too important to say anything and we didnt.   we watched the object for maybe a minute then it went into the clouds.  im not exact on the date but it was after the holland incident in 1994 and it was still summer.  p.s. ill bet if someone got radar images from the airport it may be on there it did show up in holland.

They seemed to be in a loose triangular pattern, each seeming to be independant of each other, travelling from east to west. The objects did not appear to be very high, maybe 2000 feet. They glowed orange as if reflecting the city lights.;42.9130234848484;-85.7051136363637
