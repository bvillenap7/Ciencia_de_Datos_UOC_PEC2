18 Lights in the sky flying faster than ANY aircraft!;2011-06-30 22:00:00;1-2min;18 Lights in the sky flying faster than ANY aircraft! I am sorry that I just found your website. I stumbled across your site after a simple Google Search of:  5 Triangular Shapes in the Sky. I have been alarmed about what I saw flying over my house a few years ago. I am a U.S. Navy Veteran, thus I KNOW high speed aircraft and, what I saw were NO Aircraft!  I was outside in my driveway in roughly 2011 (forgive me as it has been a couple of years so I do not exactly remember the year, since I didn't lend much credence to it at the time), but, I happened to look up in the sky and saw 3 different 6-triangle shaped lights moving VERY FAST across the sky.  There were NO Red & Green lights that would indicate any aircraft.  I live near an airport so I am used to seeing airplanes flying either overhead or very near my sightline.  These were simply white lights.  These lights were moving so fast that I literally didn't have enough time to grab my cell phone to record them moving.  There are NO aircraft that move THAT FAST! ,  Plus, I have seen the pictures of the SAME lights that I saw, but, what I saw, there was a group of 2 sets of those lights that over-lapped each other.  Meaning, and looking up and moving West to East, and number the lights from front to back, and left to right, 1 first row, 2-3 second row, 4-5-6 third row, when you see the first set of 6 lights, the second 6-set of lights were in synch, but,  the 2nd row of lights (light #2) overlapped the original 3rd set of lights at light number 6.  Then the last set of 6 lights followed behind. Again, these lights were moving way to fast to be ANY aircraft!  I have been trying to find something like I saw and your website has EXACTLY what I saw, but not in the cluster that I saw flying over my house. I wanted to try to find out if there was a fighter squadron flying overhead at that time but, there would be NO reason why a fighter squadron would be flying over this location at that time of night, and flying faster than the speed of sound, which is the ONLY way ANY objects could be flying that fast. Plus I had no idea HOW to investigate this. Thus, I just keep this to myself until I saw the images on your website. I hope that someone has an explanation to what I saw.

Changing colored object seen by  manyhovering over suburban neighborhood;2012-10-21 07:25:00;3 minutes;changing colored object seen by  manyhovering over suburban neighborhood my son and nephew were playing catch with a football when they came running in to myself and my wife that there was something flying in the sky changing colors.   We went outside to see and looked up to the south and seen these weird lights that were moving in circular motion in the sky.  The lights were changing colors from blue and red to all green and then purple, to nothing, but you could still see that it was like a black dot moving, it looked like it was moving far away like miles and coming back close.   It then moved behind the tree line so that we couldnt see it,   At that point we had realized some neighbors from across the street had been standing there watching it also.;42.9130234848484;-85.7051136363637
Swiftly moving lights in a V shape moving, west to east, on 11/14/15 @ 3am.;2015-11-14 02:50:00;1 minute;Swiftly moving lights in a V shape moving, west to east, on 11/14/15 @ 3am. As I was leaving home for work, I walked out the side door facing south.  It was a very clear night, and I often stop to observe the stars.  Then right above the tree line, I saw this object, which consisted of multiple lights in a V-shape.  It was silent, but moving very swiftly from west to east.   My mind was racing, right away trying to reason it out . . . It's not a plane nor is it mutiple planes flying in unison . . . The lights were an orange-ish hue, steady and fairly dim, not blinking or flashing.  I am certain it was a single object.   What struck me was the high rate of speed yet there was absolute silence.
