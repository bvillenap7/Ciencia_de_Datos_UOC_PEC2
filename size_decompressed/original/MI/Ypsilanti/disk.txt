5 to 7 saucers move around a few seconds and take off at high rate of speed in same direction.;2004-05-15 06:45:00;8 sec.;5 to 7 saucers move around a few seconds and take off at high rate of speed in same direction. My two oldest step-daughters, ages 12 and 13, where at they're school bus stop waiting for the bus early in the morning. one of them saw 5 to 7 dim light saucer shape ufo's. She told her sister to look and see saw them too. The objects appeared to be moving around and getting closer. The girls got scared and yelled look to the other 5 or so students that were also at the bus stop. But before any one else looked, the ufo's took off at a high rate of speed and disappeared before the other kids saw them. The other kids just looked at the girls strange because they didn't see anything. The girls were scared and didn't tell them what they saw. After the two girls told me what they saw,I questioned them carefully not to ask them any leading questions. They said the objects were close like a small private airplane and as far as they could tell, about the same size. They used to be very uncomfortable about talking about it, but now they don't mind. There were high clouds in the sky, the sun was just coming up and they were looking to the North standing at the corner of Vine St. and Arbor Dr. 5 miles West of Willow Run Airport.

One large craft flying from west to northeast over Ypsilanti MI large, with blinking/flashing lights (red and white);2012-05-23 23:15:00;3-5 minutes;One large craft flying from west to northeast over Ypsilanti MI large, with blinking/flashing lights (red and white) Last night my sister and I saw a UFO and reported it and it was incredible that we were both seeing the same thing, and that thing was a real UFO that to the best of my knowledge could only be aliens, but as for now it is unidentified.  Tonight at 11:15 I was in bed and looked out my west window and saw a flying objects with blinking lights. When I saw the blinking lights I immediately thought it was a plane, but right after I saw the first blinking lights, the craft revealed more of itself and I saw many blinking lights, far more than any plane should have.  At this point the craft does look like it could be circular/saucer type form.  After I saw this on the west side of my house I go to wake up my sister in her room on the east side and look out and we saw the craft much farther south north than I had anticipated when waiting for it to come back into my view.  The entire time the object moved relatively slowly compared to a plane but that depends on the height.  We saw the lights get farther away as it moved north-easterly and over some houses and trees.  The second time I saw the craft it was much more saucer looking the lights were more in line now.  One large craft flying from west to northeast large, with blinking lights of various colors (the notable ones being red and white) possibly a saucer style.;42.2369972067039;-83.6135385474858
6 bright yellowish orange objects sighted, 4 disks, 1 rectangular box, and 1 line increasing in size downward,then vanished.;2012-08-21 20:50:00;1-2 minutes;6 bright yellowish orange objects sighted, 4 disks, 1 rectangular box, and 1 line increasing in size downward,then vanished. Driving west on Ellsworth, I sighted six bright yellowish orange objects in the sky to the right of the moon. Four were disk shaped, one was like a rectangular box that seemed a little transparent and one was a long line that continued to increase in size.  I had been speaking with my brother who lives in Brighton, on the cell phone.  Upon sighting this, I pulled over and told him to look to the west.  He also saw the long bright orange colored line and had his son get this telescope.  Due to trees in his areas, he could not spot the other objects.  All of a sudden, all six objects simply disappeared.;42.2369972067039;-83.6135385474858
