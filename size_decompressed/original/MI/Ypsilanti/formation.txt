I was driving a taxi-cab...enroute to pick up a passenger at a nearby hospital... When I turned onto Washtenaw Ave. I observed three objects off to the W-NW... They flew in a tri-angular or V formation... Each object had an extremely bright white light on the front... and an alternating red-white light on the rear...so bright you could see it reflecting the pavement... I pulled off road and got out of my car to watch them as they passed.. This was observed on sunday, August 7, 1994, at approximately 1030 PM, which was a hot and humid sunday night (about low 80s)... I noted that as passed, and they nearly passed directly over me, they made no noise at all... They travelled at a very slow speed...from WNW to ESE...at about 50 kts or so and at a very low altitude (less than 100 ft)...but I had nothing to compare their size... I watched them for about 45 minutes...when i observed them start a shallow bank to the right... I could see that they were heading towards downtown Ypsilanti, so I got back into my cab and got on my cab-radio and without telling why, askied the dispatcher, who was a friend, to step out of the office, turn to the north, and look up...he did...and they passed over the office... I then proceeded to go to the hospital to pick up my passenger...and to run in and call 911...I told them what I was, which way they were headed... I asked the operator if there were any other calls on the objects... they tol me they couln't say... Thats the gist...i I can give additional details if necessay... I can be reached at 734 ((number deleted)) and ((e-address deleted))... ((name and identifier deleted));42.2369972067039;-83.6135385474858
