Saw shadows in woods. I live in a 2 story appartment with my wife and 4 kids. Our bedroom is on the second story of the unit facing the back.  There is a small patch of woods in back of the appartment. My wife had a dream that she saw a cone shaped UFO flying. She said it was a very realistic dream. When she woke up, she went to use the upstairs bathroom. As she was tinkling, she heard the basement door down-stairs shut. She was frightened and hurried back to bed. She tried to wake me, but I was sound asleep. She laid there still with her eyes open. After a few minutes, there was a bright light that shined in the bedroom window. She said it was so bright, it lit the room up like daylight. It lasted just a few seconds. after a minute she got up to look out the window. She said see saw a couple of shadows moving around in the woods. She then woke me up and explained what she saw and heard. I looked out the window and went down-stairs but didn't see or hear anything. The next day I looked out in the woods and the businesses behind the woods, but couldn't find anything. But I know my wife heard and saw things that there is no reasonable explaination for. She was 4 weeks pregnant at the time. Thank you and God bless.;42.2369972067039;-83.6135385474858
