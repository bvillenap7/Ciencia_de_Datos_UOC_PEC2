While driving east on Textile road my wife, oldest son an myself noticed an orange glowing object hovering above the road.  We perceived the object to be much larger than just the glowing globe area as the rest was shrouded in a mist that obscured the trees along the road in front of us.   I slowed the car as we approached, to almost a full stop and found that we were directly under the glowing area of the object.  I looked carefully at this and can describe it as looking through a distorted lense.   There was a lot going on in terms of changing colors and shapes however I believe I observed an appendage or a mast of some sort that appeared to be generating the mist or distortion that was shrouding the remainder of the object.  This was very weird and very strange and distance perception seemed to be distorted.   I disengaged my eyes from the object, pulled onto Cherrywood Dr. and my son and I exited the car to get a better look however the object was gone.  My wife expressed concern that a man on the sidewalk was staring at us so we got back in the car, turned it around, turned right back onto Textile Rd. and continued eastbound.   Shortly after turning back onto Textile we again acquired the object this time further to our east moving north and crossing over Textile road.  As we got closer the object changed direction and begain moving in a northeasterly direction darting from side to side as it moved along.  The object simply then vanished.   We were very close to this thing and I believe it was only 20 to 30 feet from us as we observed the glowing area of it.  Very weird and very strange.;42.2369972067039;-83.6135385474858
