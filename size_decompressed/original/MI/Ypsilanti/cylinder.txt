Low speed flight, with a climb then light went away I was with my mother driving home from work.  The street we were on is called &quotGrove Road&quot I noticed the object to my left.  It looked as if it was flying through clouds. It was very low to the deck, I want to say maybe 400-500 feet.  It was a red color. My first impression of this was a meteor, but, it was flying level. Also I want to add that I thought the windshield of the car was making the object red.  My mom insited we pull over and get out and take a look.   We drove for  maybe a few more yards before we stopped.  Before we stopped my mom rolled down her window to see if we could hear anything.  Nothing was heard.  The best way to describe the range of the object from us was like at an Airshow.  The object then made a climb and the color began to turn from a dark red to a red with white in it.  It was stationary for a bit, then it continued on its path and the light just went out. I saw no landing light nor FAA lights on the object.;42.2369972067039;-83.6135385474858
