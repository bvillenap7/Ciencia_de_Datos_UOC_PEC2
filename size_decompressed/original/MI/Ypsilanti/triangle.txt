Black triangle over Martz Rd. moving towards Ypsilanti.;2006-11-11 23:15:00;5 minutes;Black triangle over Martz Rd. moving towards Ypsilanti. I was driving on Martz Rd. towards Whittaker Rd, near Tuttle Hill Rd.  I saw an object move slowly across the sky, the object had 3 white/yellow lights, none where blinking.I approached it with my vehicle as it crossed paths with me.   THe object was then pretty close to me and I could see a triangular shaped craft with a light near each corner.  Near the center there was a cluster of lights, but I can't remember the exact pattern or color.   This object moved to slowly to be an aircraft and it appeared to be only a few hundred feet in altitude.  I slowed down my vehicle but never stopped nor exited my vehicle.   I watched it fly into the horizon where it then appeared to be flat with a white/yellow on each end.   The object seemed like it was alittle lower to the ground and bigger too.;42.2369972067039;-83.6135385474858

Group of triangle shape &quotufo&quots fly westward over Ypsilanti, Mi at 10:30 on 6/21/2012;2012-06-21 22:30:00;5-10 minutes;group of triangle shape &quotufo&quots fly westward over Ypsilanti, Mi at 10:30 on 6/21/2012 3-4 triangle shape ufos flying east to west over Ypsilanti/Pittsfield Township towards Saline, Mi. Multicolored alternating blinking lights on each side of the triangle with solid white lights on each corner. craft was flying with a broad side of the triangle first, not a point of the triangle. flight seemed to be fast, but it's hard to tell the distance, the craft moved easier through the air than any planes, as if there were no resistance. one craft flew west until the flashing lights couldn't be seen behind the clouds, but it didn't go over the horizon, it went in a straight line out and up. another craft may have veered southwest or south from the east.;42.2369972067039;-83.6135385474858
Triangle craft traveling back and forth East and West over Ypsilanti around 10:30;2012-06-23 22:30:00;5 minutes;Triangle craft traveling back and forth East and West over Ypsilanti around 10:30 The second night in a row that I saw triangle shaped craft flying over my house in Ypsilanti. They flew over East to West around 10:30 pm and West to East around 10:45 pm. The craft looked to be triangular judging by the light position lights would blink in sequence one after the other, and the lights may have been changing color. The night before my sister and I had seen something and she saw it and didn't know what it was, this time she said it was a plane, but I trust my judgement more than hers. Before I ever say anything I make sure it isn't a plane.;42.2369972067039;-83.6135385474858
Triangle shaped craft traveling East over Ypsilanti;2012-06-24 22:45:00;5-15 minutes;Triangle shaped craft traveling East over Ypsilanti Triangle lights craft seen over my house in Ypsilanti slowly traveling south, I immediately knew it wasn't a plane or anything else I could identify so I told my mom to look out the window and she barely looks and says it's a plane. I argued with her because she didn't even look at it and I wanted to say that there were two witnesses on this report. I know it was not a plane. The craft floated southwards with three major lights blinking in sequence, it moved very slow and it seemed to be rather low but I noticed it go behind some clouds and light them up. The second craft was seen about 5 minutes after and it looked to be 3X higher up than the first and it was moving very slowly still and headed Eastward.;42.2369972067039;-83.6135385474858
Low and slow moving with red and white lights;2013-04-23 03:15:00;40-60 seconds;Low and slow moving with red and white lights Saw a low flying object that at first I assumed was a plane.  It was moving rather slow for a plane so then I thought it could be a helicopter.  I rolled down my car window to listen but could hear nothing.  It continued flying to the south over riverside park and proceeded to stop. I then lost sight of it through trees as I continued driving.;42.2369972067039;-83.6135385474858
Triangle shaped object.;2016-10-21 07:00:00;3 minutes;I was driving my kids to school out in Ypsilanti this am (7 am to be exact), it was still dark outside.  As I was driving my daughter said look over on the right side, it's a triangle shaped object with 3 bright lights flying low.   At first I ignored her, shrugging it off believing it was an airplane.  But as I tried to stare at it while driving, I noticed it was getting lower and it didn't resemble an airplane.  The flying object was shaped like an triangle with 3 bright lights that formed to a triangle.   My daughter grabbed her phone and snapped a picture.  As her flasher went off, the triangle object quickly shifted towards our car, flying low, then disappeared.;42.2369972067039;-83.6135385474858
high flying object stationary for at least 5 minutes before quickly flying out of sight;2020-06-11 12:12:00;6 minutes;high flying object stationary for at least 5 minutes before quickly flying out of sight I happened to look up at the sky to view a cloud on a very windy and cool day with blue sky and a few thin clouds and noticed what I originally assumed was a high-flying plane (30,000 to 40,000 feet). However, it had no contrail and it did not move. It stayed stationary for 5 minutes. And when I say stationary I mean it DID NOT MOVE for at least the 5 minutes I observed it.  I heard no noise. It was very windy and it simply did not move.  After 5 minutes of no noise and no movement it suddenly took off extremely fast and disappeared into the horizon within 5 seconds.  This was seen over St. Joseph Mercy Hospital parking lot P near the administration building.;42.2369972067039;-83.6135385474858
