White Orb with 2 red lights takes gift.;2012-07-30 22:00:00;5 minutes;White Orb with 2 red lights takes gift. I found a locust in my above ground pool and I saved him.  I picked him up with my net and placed him on a table to dry out.  Later on, my son and I went for a swim in our pool.  This locust flew by us as he was buzing the tower several times.   The next evening I was sitting on my back porch smoking and I noticed an flat white orb in front of my garage.  I also noticed two red lights next to it.  I didn't know if it was a spirit or an ufo.   I decided at that point that I would give it something.  I went inside and got something, but when I came back, it was gone.  I knew it would be back the next day, and it was.  The orb was not there, but the 2 red lights were.   I put the gift on the pool filter unit, and it hesitated.  So, I took it off and stood outside.  I noticed that it could not be above electrical units.  As I was stepping away, the item slowly left my pouch.  So they got it.  What's next?
