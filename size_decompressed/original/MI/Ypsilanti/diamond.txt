Diamond/trapezoid craft flying north over Ypsilanti, Mi;2012-05-22 22:30:00;1 minute;Diamond/trapezoid craft flying north over Ypsilanti, Mi My sister and I were in our living room watching tv and out of the window facing west my sister stared and muted the tv and told me to look and I did.  We both saw a diamond like shape craft (assuming the shape because of the placement of the lights, it was too dark to see anything other than the lights)  The craft flew from south to north, it did seem to move pretty fast and it was once it flew over some trees that we saw how close it was, it was much closer than an airplane would be at its highest and if an airplane were landing it would still be closer possibly. it looked more like it was gliding, not like most flying aircraft, not even gliding but sliding like it was being pulled along a track, it changed speeds because once we noticed it go over the trees we saw the lights afterwards for another 30 to 40 seconds and it was getting lower.  We’re very sure it wasn’t a plane, it moved to weird to be a plane.   Also, I’ve seen something relatively similar to wh! at I saw tonight out that window before and going in the same directing and making almost the same course, each time the lights have seemed the same a diamond-like trapezoid three lights in a line with the middle set more to the back, and one more above the middle light. This is the first time someone else has seen it with me.;42.2369972067039;-83.6135385474858
