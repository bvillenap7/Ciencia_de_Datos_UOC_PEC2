((Star??));2009-09-13 20:15:00;Several Hours;Very bright object hovered aboved the treetops for a long time before moving extremely slowly toward the west The object was high above the treetops to the southeast, and was stationary for at least 45 minutes.  When it did move, it moved extremely slowly and moved in a circular direction.  It then stopped temporarily, and then began to move very slowly again, but this time in a trajectory to the right or west, but each time it did this, it would stop, and start going in a circle toward the east once again as if to stay above the treetops.   After a few minutes, it would begin the trajectory to the west again, each time climbing higher into the sky.   With time, the object made its way high enough into the sky that it need not attempt to venture back toward the treetops.  At the beginning, the object appeared to look like a cylinder with one part divided into two parts, with antennas coming off the top and from the middle section.   When it began the trajectory portion of its journey the object took on an oval shape resembling an eye with multi-colored lights projectin! g from underneath its shape.   Another shape that the object took on resembled a ball with spikes on all sides instead of soft edges.  The spikes took on multi-colored lights, green, red, white, and yellow.  At its highest elevation, the object resembled a cross between a round shape and an oval.  It was bright white in color, and continued to move extremely slowly as it climbed higher and higher into the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of a star or planet??
