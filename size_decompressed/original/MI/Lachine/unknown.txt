Black bulky slow floating object above trees...flying humanoid?;2012-06-22 21:30:00;1-2 minutes;Black bulky slow floating object above trees...flying humanoid? My husband,  8 year old daughter, and I were outside my husband’s uncle’s house around 9:30pm on June 22nd 2012. We were looking toward the eves of the house waiting for bats to fly out so we could patch up the hole they had found.  It was just starting to get dark and my husband pointed to the sky on the side of the house.  We saw this dark black object approaching towards us about 2 -3 telephone poles high above the tree tops.  I’d say this object was about ¼ mile away or closer when first seen.  I asked what it was and he said he didn’t know.  It made no sound at all and moved very slow..slower than a bird.  It was moving in a perfectly straight path right in front of us and kept going until it disappeared behind trees blocking our view.  There was no detail to this object and its shape is something I don’t even know how to describe.  It was a big mass about the size between a man and a car. It looked very bulky.  It wasn’t balloons, a bird, or anything I! have ever seen in my life.  This object was very visible against the sky and there was plenty of light still to determine this was not anything we have seen before. We had about 2 minutes of looking at this thing and the way it moved in such a perfect straight line..and its size while making no noise really bothers me!!  We are both college educated and never expected or looked to see anything of this nature.  After looking on line I found a you tube video that shows exactly what we saw..It’s the video of the flying Mexican humanoid.  I don’t believe in witches or flying people but that is exactly what we saw that night, I don’t know what to think.;45.0397;-83.7507
