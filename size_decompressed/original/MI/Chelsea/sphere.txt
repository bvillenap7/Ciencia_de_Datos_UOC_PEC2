Maybe 3 orbs medium grey. 27 year old daughter saw what appeared to be 3 very close objects emitting short thick plumes behind them. Pulled vehicle over so I could look but the object(s) were heading away to the east toward Detroit.   First impression was a asteroid but when my daughter and her boyfriend put their binocs on them they thought they looked like 3 orbs.  Could not tell if they were joined or not. Could distinctly see 3 plumes.  Military bomber perhaps?  Never saw plane like that before if it was.  It kept flying at altitude at a steady rate of speed.  Hopefully more people noticed it.  Weather was clear and sunny.;42.3204;-84.0351
