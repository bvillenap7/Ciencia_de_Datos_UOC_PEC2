10-12 objects seen in sky at late dawn;2009-07-25 21:45:00;4 minutes;10-12 objects seen in sky at late dawn 10-12 orange colored, circle shaped objects going to the east at about a 45 degree angle in the sky from where I was standing.  The 12th one came up from the north-east from what it appeared to be the ground, shot up quickly to the others and followed them to the east and those other 11 objects were in a straight line like formation as it appeared to me.  The sun was almost completly set, there was still very little light in the sky, and it was partially cloudy.   I saw them go up into the clouds to the east and basically dissapeared in to them.;42.3204;-84.0351
