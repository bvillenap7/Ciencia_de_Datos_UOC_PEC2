The time now in Holly,MI is 2:20 a.m.I think I saw a UFO or I should say UFOs. The time was between 1 a.m. - 1:45 a.m.I was driving my mother-in-law home when I spied a reflection in the very upper 1/4 of my windshield.It followed me.I kept trying to see if it was a reflection from a street light and such but even when I was not by a street light it was still there.Then as I moved my eyes up and forward in front of my jeep I saw quick flashes of light dance ahead of me.Then there were 5 what appeared to be lighted oblong shaped clouds moving overhead(just above the Holly donut shop)in a clock wise direction....gradually their number dwindled down to four and then three.And they would go strictly in a plain circular motion for awhile and then they would start to dip and dive and it looked as if they were chasing each other.It looked like they may have been playing or doing a dance.Their movements were very smooth and graceful...it was actually beautiful to sit and watch.The air was thick and hazy from the humidity.There was not a cloud or star in the sky.My mother-in-law saw the same as I saw.There was a pay phone right next to my jeep where I was parked so I got out of my jeep to call home so my husband might be able to see this spectacular sight also.When I first picked the receiver up before even placing any quarters into the slot I heard this terrible static that was very loud.When I placed the quarters into the slot I still heard the static.I tried 3 times and on the third try I was able to get thru.My husband was able to make it in time to see what his mother and I were witnessing...I had him bring my camera bag.(I tried to get some pics but was not successfuk in this attempt.All pictures came out as black as night with nothing in them.) We watched them some more and then they hovered together for a sec and disappeared...poof!...into thin air.They disappeared very quickly.If they were not UFOs I do not know what else they could be....there was no beam of light going up into the sky ! from the ground.There is no airport close by and there was no carnival.Plus when I was a little girl 8 years old I saw the exact same thing when I lived in a trailer park in Brighton,MI  in 1967 only there were two and they acted in the same exact manner.My brother and 2 friends witnessed this particular show with me.I am writing to you because of your experiences with such sightings.What do you think it was that we saw?Is there a way that I could report this?And maybe see if anything was reported as being sighted in Holly,MI on this day at this time?I know now that I was not dreaming about what I saw when I was 8 years old.;42.7905;-83.6127

Very personal sighting.;2012-11-23 22:40:00;30 seconds;Very personal sighting. I walked outside my barn and looked up in the sky and two of them flew up over my head at about 20,000 ft.  I stared up at the two lights because i knew they were looking down on me because right when i walked out and looked up they focused their light down on me.  They either lost interest or sensed my uneasiness and their lights dimmed as they flew off from a complete stand still.;42.7905;-83.6127
15-18 lights orangish-yellow top & bottom, red center.;2015-06-20 23:20:00;5 minutes;15-18 lights orangish-yellow top & bottom, red center. 2015jun20 at 11:20pm ufo sighting. The 15-18 lights were orangish-yellow on top and bottom, red in the center.   They were flying rather low (from my vantage point, maybe 20 degrees up from horizon) in groups of three in a straight line, from west to east in the northern sky.  They seemed to pulse & made no sound, and were traveling at approximately 30mph.   When they disappeared behind the trees, I got in my car and drove north about a 1/2 mile to a clearing (appox. 2 minutes) where I had clear view for 10 miles to the east (the direction they were headed) and they were just gone. Note:  as straight as their flight formation was, they may have been one long craftâ€¦;42.7905;-83.6127
