We saw a RED ball of light that blinked a faw times and moved so fast across the expressway that it couldn't of been a plane or helicopter and it was right above the tree line not high in the sky at all.  It happened so fast we both looked at each other and couldn't believe what we saw.   We are creeped out right now, and we have never been a believer until now, I know it couldnt of been anything normal.  This was out of this world.   I called it in to the MI state police and he sounded like it wasn't the first time he heard this story.  I looked it up online and noticed more people are seeing the same thing.;42.7905;-83.6127
