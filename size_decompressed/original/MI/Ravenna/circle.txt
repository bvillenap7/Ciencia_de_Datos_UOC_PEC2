I was dropping my sister in law off at home (which was on a golf course), when we exited the car we noticed this very large object to our left with brightly colored lights hovering over a tree.  We just stood staring at it for at least 20 minutes, I think we said a few things about what it could not have been and decided it must be a UFO, after about 20 minutes I told her to go and get her mom and I would watch the object.  It remained in the same place making no noise as it had been the entire time, when I heard the back door realizing they coming out I yelled it was there while turning towards thier direction and as I turned back towards the object it was gone.  No noise and no evidence it had even been there.  My sister in law and I tried to explain to my mother in law what we had seen and she tried to explain it away.  My sister in law and I discussed it in private many times after that and knew it could not have been a plane for many reasons, the lights were all wrong in color and a plane could not have held the same position for that period of time, not to mention the closeness to the tree, a helicoptor would defeinately have way to much noise and not have the lights.  These lights were bright red, yellow, and green.  The brighness of the lights are what held our amazement for so long.  We did not discuss this with many people after because we thought people would send us to the nut house.  It did happen!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
