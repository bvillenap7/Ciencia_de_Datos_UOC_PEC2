GIANT floating 'candle light' moved across sky above Boyne City Michigan around 9pm at night.;2011-07-11 21:10:00;3-4 minutes;GIANT floating 'candle light' moved across sky above Boyne City Michigan around 9pm at night. I have camping for 29 years in Michigan, a yearly trip with about 10 other families, once a year.  On our last night, around 9 pm before the sun fully set, I was frantically called out of my tent by some of our camping group to come witness a UFO. The UFO looked like a large, wide candle light flying through the sky.  It looked to be quite far away, and moving at a fast rate (for how far it appeared to be away).  It appeared to be moving from SW to NE.  It was only visible to me for about a minute before I lost it behind some trees. It was unlike anything we had ever seen, some members of my camping group thought it was a plane that had caught fire, until I pointed out that there was no smoke trail, and it didnt seem to be losing altitude at all.  We have no clue really, what this could have been, I just figured it needs to be reported, so here we are. Unfortunately none of us had a camera handy to record it as we were sitting around a group campfire, which is a bit of a bummer.  However, the number of witnesses, and the quality of them (HS Principal, School Board Trustee, Psychologists, among other professions), not to mention most of these people (friends of my Parents) I have known since I was born, leads credibility to this sighting.;45.203;-85.0135
