Thinking it was a jet plane I went back inside. The noise continued getting louder, I again went out into the back yard but did not see anything but stars. I went into our living room where my husband, son, and son's friend were watching TV and asked can't you hear that, they said yes but thought it was just a jet going over. I told them that was what I thought too, but it must be more than one and going very slow. They went outside to the front of the house and came rushing back in and said you have to come out and see this. We all went out to the front yard and could see this huge diamond shape with elongated bottom, with a light at each tip and an orange light in the middle. It gradually moved off to the northwest. I went back inside and within 5 minutes they yelled it was coming back. We all watched as it traveled over our home traveling southeast, when it got over Boyne City all of a sudden all of the outside lights started to spin around. Shortly the light on the right side veered off over Lake Charlevoix, which was to the west, while rest of the craft continued on its course, but soon the lone light came back and was heading the same direction as the large craft. It traveled until it was out of sight. The next day at work, two of my co-workers said they had also heard the noise, but had not gone outside to investigate. I then started calling law enforcement agencies, FAA, and local airports. I was unable to find out anything.;45.203;-85.0135
