Flame object, moving low and fast;2010-06-11 22:50:00;3 min;Flame object, moving low and fast Wife and I were on our deck, night sky and noticed a what apppeared to be a flame object which had already gone overhead by the time we noticed.  Flame because it flickered in that sense. It was large enough to recognize the flickering.  Thought of a hot air ballon but it was traveling too fast and flame was too visable to be of any highth to catch major winds for speed. Surface winds were 5 mph.  No sound. It was traveling South to North and kept a steady direction until it dissapeared.  Weird because of flame versus glowing lights like most sightings.   Not a meteor high / low characteristic nor any trail of light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.8934;-85.7614
