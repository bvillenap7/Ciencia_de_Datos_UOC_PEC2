New type of aircraft?;2014-02-24 20:00:00;3 minutes;New type of aircraft? It appears as if there were 3 crafts moving roughly SW.  The sound was what I initially noticed because we are not near a large airport. The lights were bright orange and looked like a fireball.  One of the crafts had the burst of fire, traveled a distance, another fireball, traveled a distance and a third fireball.  It almost looked like it was using thrusters (to use a sci-fi term). The bursts of light were about 10 times brighter than you would see on a commercial aircraft when its white light is blinking.
