Orange fireball seen in cloud covered sky;2018-08-04 21:56:00;10 minutes;Orange fireball seen in cloud covered sky In East Tawas, there is a State Pier, and in order to get my steps in I decided to go for a walk on it.  When I first started my walk I noticed a orange colored star way out by the point of the bay and thought it was just that, a planet or a star.  As I reached the end of the dock I realized it was the only star I had seen the whole time and decided to see which star it was with an app on my phone called “SkyView” but there was no name or object in it’s place.   I thought this was odd and realized it was even more odd because there was a cloud cover which didn’t let me see a single light in the sky except that one.   I stayed longer and took as good of a picture of it as I could with my phone and decided to walk back home.  The way the dock is made is it has corners offering different view points of the bay and I noticed as I  was walking back this object stayed in exactly the same spot and I get I was viewing a different angle of it because it was not moving with me, like a normal obeject in space.   I watched it until I got off the dock when at this point I glanced down to mess with my phone, and upon viewing back to where I saw the object, it was gone.  The object appeared to be a perfect sphere and was a fiery orange color.  I was viewing this against a black sky that was filled with clouds making it the only light in the sky.;44.2991;-83.4729
