((HOAX??))  Tessellated ufo with shifting rhomboidal panes. Very large and within hundreds of feet from the ground.;2010-09-08 11:30:00;1.5 minutes;Tessellated ufo with shifting rhomboidal panes. Very large and within hundreds of feet from the ground. I was driving with my friend from downstate Michigan to the upper peninsula late at night when a series of adjacent stars became increasingly bright.  I watched the stars for a couple of seconds, and then a unusual figure almost popped out of the sky.  The craft was very atypical of what one may expect from a UFO I was like watching rhombuses and trapezoids shifting positions, like each shape was its own pane.  Each pane was outlined in a bright white light (about 5 stars thick [in perspective from the Earth]) and the center was  empty.   The craft was also very large (about 5 suns in perspective from the ground), and was within hundreds of feet from the ground.  I pulled the car over in shock, and the gliding tesseral object stopped. I panicked, and I drove off as fast as possible.  Later, I researched the object I spotted and did not find anything that even looked similar to the one I saw.  The one piece of research that was interesting was on light travel.  The online article states that stars could be used to transport in theory this craft may of well done that.  Overall, the experience was both scary and ominous. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.3767;-85.0945999999999
