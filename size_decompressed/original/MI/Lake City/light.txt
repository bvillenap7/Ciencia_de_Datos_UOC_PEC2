Three white lights forming triangle moving through nightime sky;2002-09-10 21:30:00;1-2 minutes;Three white lights forming triangle moving through nightime sky I am not sure what this was exactly. I was star gazing when I saw what I thought was a satellite but then noticed two more behind it forming a triangle motion heading south and slightly west. It was a little slower than most satellites I have watched in the past and even seemed to stop once for just a few seconds and it kept the perfect triangle formation the whole time. What I was seeing was three small white starlike lights just moving across the sky just like satellites do but in a perfect triangle form. For all I know it could have been three small satellites or who knows what. I have been trying to find info on if there are a set of satellites out there like that or if I have really seen something out of the ordinary. Can anyone help me out here?
