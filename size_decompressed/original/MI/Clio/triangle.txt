My Radio in my car cut out and my phone didn't have a signal in a place where it should always have one. All it did was hover over the intersection, I parked my car at.  I just watched it for about 5 min and then I thought I should draw it because I didn't have a camera. I reached for a pen and paper in the car, and when I looked back up, it was gone.;43.1819;-83.7238
