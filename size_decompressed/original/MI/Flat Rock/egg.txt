10-15 UFOs spotted over I-75, orange in color.;2013-08-20 21:14:00;6 minutes;10-15 UFOs spotted over I-75, orange in color. I say hundreds saw because I was turning onto West Rd from I-75 and you have to be blind not to see them.   They were traveling North over 75. Managed to take a picture, only got 3.  Orange in color and almost glowing like an ember from a fire.   I was always a skeptic until now, having been in military, never knew of craft that looked like them, likely not a UAV or something else.   This needs a further investigation, I know something I shouldnt have.;42.1055;-83.2795000000001
