white glowing flying wing;2001-05-18 01:30:00;4 minutes;white glowing flying wing While looking at the stars a mooving light caught my eye. The object was mooving  directly above me from east to west. I thought it was a satelite untill the light did a radical change of direction,making about a 30 degree turn to the south west without banking or slowing. It was then I could see the object had shape and a white glow. It made another sharp turn without banking and now was flying due south. The object never made noise and had allmost a wobbly, eratic way of flying,though it flew quite fast. I watched the object fly south for what I judged was about three miles when it did a 360 degree turn without banking or slowing down and came back over me.  It appeared to be a little lower and looked to be somewhat trianguler.  The object continued on this path and flew into some clouds and I never saw it again.;42.1055;-83.2795000000001
