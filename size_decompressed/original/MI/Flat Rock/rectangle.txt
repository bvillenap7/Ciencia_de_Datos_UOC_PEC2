I was with a friend and we were parked in a car on a dirt road facing west.  It was around dusk and date is approximate.  Noticed a low flying object flying away from us going in a west direction, while other planes were flying south.  It was flying at the same pace or slower than the neighboring aircraft flying above.  The only visible side we could see was the back due to the direction, it was flying away from us. The back of the object was rectangular and flat.  5 huge round spotlight shaped lights were on the back, from edge to edge almost touching each other and were as tall as the object spanning from the edge of the top to the bottom.  The white lights were strobing from right to left at a slow pace.  The first would flash on then turn off then immediatly the next would flash on then off.  The object was quite big, it seemed almost big enough for a plane to fit inside of it, heightwise.  It did not have any typical small aircraft identification lights.  It made no sound that we could hear.;42.1055;-83.2795000000001
