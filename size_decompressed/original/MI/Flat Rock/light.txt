Faint, weaving, red lights over Michigan.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of celestial bodies, we suspect.  PD));2007-08-15 00:00:00;1-2 hours;Faint, weaving, red lights over Michigan. One night after putting a bonfire out at my house. Me and some buddys laid on my patio to look at the stars and talk. While we were looking up, we noticed several little faint, red dots which had to definately be outside of the earths atmosphere. The red dots moved in a weaving pattern, some of the weaving was in a very small area and some weaved in a very large area, it seemed as if they never went over the same area twice. We prolly laid there for about 2 hours just watching whatever these dots were, they were everywhere across the sky. I know we weren't just seeing things because we could describe where one was at in the sky, all focus on it, and describe the same movement, and which star formations they were near.

Three foggy, kind of small, white lights moving fairly fast across the sky.  They were moving in a vertical line kind of bobbing side by side as they were moving.  My first UFO sighting, never seen anything like it.;42.1055;-83.2795000000001

Light was bright and moved across the sky at fast rate.  Had to be below cloud line or just above.  Light got brighter and brighter before just disappearing.  This light moved across the sky at an extreme rate.  Started slow then zipped across the horizon.  Like I said, overcast with light snow.  Had to be at a lower elevation.;42.1055;-83.2795000000001
