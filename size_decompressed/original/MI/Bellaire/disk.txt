Glowing disc;2009-07-20 00:00:00;60 sec.;My friend and I were camping in a field when I suddenly saw this disc like object in the sky followed by two others traveling unusually fast when suddenly it stopped and came closer to earth then flew again.  When it stopped it turned orange then quickly flew up into darkness.  The wired thing was when I tried to take a photo you could see stars but not the disc.  The other two kept close to the first glowing disc.   We stand by what we know we saw.;44.9797;-85.2232
