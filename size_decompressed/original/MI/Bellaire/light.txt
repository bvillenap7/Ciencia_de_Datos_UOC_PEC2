Bright, high triangle of lights moving S to N at orbital velocity.;2014-05-24 03:45:00;3 minutes;Bright, high triangle of lights moving S to N at orbital velocity. At 0330-0340,  I got up to observe the meteor shower.  I observed a bright light (brighter than any other object in the sky) at zenith and proceeding north.   I had time to step inside my house and retrieve a pair of binoculars.  The object had moved 25-30 degrees off vertical in the 15 seconds it took to return with the binoculars.  Closer observation revealed the bright light to be three bright white lights flying in close triangle formation.   No navigation lights were visible.  Lights did not blink or waver.  No sound was noted.    Lights were moving 2 x 3 times faster than the occasional jet traffic that passes over our very small town.  No meteors were observed during this period.  No other satellites were visible.   Again, this observation was noteworthy as the object traveled south to north.

Hovering, blinking light in sky, Bellaire, MI.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius.  PD));2014-12-18 21:30:00;1 hour +;Hovering, blinking light in sky, Bellaire, MI. Clear cold night, visibility and ceiling unlimited.  Large, bright object to east of Bellaire MI, stationary in sky, approximately 10 degrees off the horizon.  Object appears to have multiple flashing lights, white, green, blue and occasionally red.  Experienced observers opinion that these lights are not consistent with aircraft navigation lights or a hovering helicopter.  Same light set has been seen on 2 or 3 occasions in different parts of the sky, mostly to north of Bellaire, again by multiple witnesses.  One aircraft was visible in the sky during this sighting.
