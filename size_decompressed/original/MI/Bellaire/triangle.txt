It was ;2001-11-15 20:00:00;30 minutes;I heard a jet approx. 8 pm and looked up.  I not only saw the jet but also a slow moving, large object heading north to south.  It was boomerang or triangle shape with lights around the outside emitting a low, rumbling sound.  I got into my van and followed the object south until it disappeared, but upon returning to my home, 10 minutes later, it was back traveling south to north.  Again I followed the object north of town.  I could not see the object any longer, but did see four (I am guessing) military jets flying in formation over our small village apparently in search of this object.  Calls to the local police only verified that others had reported a strange object and that the FAA was notified.  No other information was ever forthcoming.  Our village is located at 45 degrees latitude, 80 degrees longitude.;44.9797;-85.2232
