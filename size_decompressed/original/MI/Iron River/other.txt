((NUFORC Note:  We believe the report may describe a twinkling star, or planet.  They frequently are reported to appear to move in a nighttime sky.  PD)) Our families were all driving back to our cottages from a night of pizza in town.  My cousin notice a low star that was changing colors dramatically.  He drove home and called some of us out to the frozen shore to see the display.  Here is waht we saw. A low star...lowest in the sky.  Sitting NW of our city of Iron River.  It was blue, green and red.  With the human eye, the object shifted erratically to the left and to the right.  Than making loops and oval circles in the sky.  We were horrified.  My cousine got his video camera and while holding it so very steady, this object was dancing across the sky, left right, in out and the most bizzarre was that it would change shapes from a cigar to wheel to diamond to circular...and we have it on tape.  The object in focus, whether through binoculars or video camera was almost like looking at special effects.  Glowing, than blurring, than into a sphere that shot rays of green, blue and yellow light.  Jupiter....?  I think not.  This object was being manuvered and here is the kicker...it dissappeared out of the sky after five hours.  How can a planet do that?  How can a planet do U shaped flying in the sky?  None of the other stars where doing that,;46.0966;-88.641
