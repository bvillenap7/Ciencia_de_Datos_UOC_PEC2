It was around the middle of March that this took place.  I was with a friend of mine, and we were looking down into a ravine with maples and other tree and vegetation when a huge, bright white light zipped across the bottom of the ravine.  It was in the form of a ball, and was gone in about a second.  Ten minutes later, a second one, slightly smaller in shape followed. it was about nine thirty pm central time.;46.0966;-88.641
