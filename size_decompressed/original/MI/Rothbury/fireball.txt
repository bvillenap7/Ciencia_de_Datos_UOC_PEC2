Large flame in sky, turns and dissapears upwards into darkness during Rothbury Festival.;2008-07-05 15:30:00;1-5 Minutes;Large flame in sky, turns and dissapears upwards into darkness during Rothbury Festival. What appeared to be a large airborne round-shaped flame moved slowly and silently around the area in the sky.  It then turned upwards, gaining altitude, and slowly disappeared.  As the object turned upwards, it appeared as if the flame was part of a larger object/ship.  It was too dark to make out any other parts of the object.  There were several people watching in my immediate area who witnessed it.  This took place during the 2008 Rothbury Music and Arts Festival, it is possible that other patrons of the festival witnessed it.  The festival had an attendance of around 100,000 people.  This took place in the early morning hours with a clear sky and zero wind. ((NUFORC Note:  Time may be wrong.  We have amended the time to 15:30 hrs..  PD));43.5099;-86.3457
