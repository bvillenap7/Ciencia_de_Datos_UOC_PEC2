The puppy woke me up by licking my face wanting to go potty...so i got all my winter apparel on an out we went. As my pup was doing her business i noticed the skies were clear and the stars were shining bright..i noticed what i thought was mars west of me towards lake mi. It was a small yellow round circle sitting next to a star..i thought it looked odd for some reason...my pup peed for a few moments and then i saw it move. I pulled on leash to stop pup from pulling me as i watched it head south possibly muskegon Mi. It wasnt moving fast however fast enough to go some distance and then it slowed right down almost to a stop but it turned and headed straight down...i couldnt see it anymore the trees were in my view... I just stood their dumb founded and as this was my first encounter with an unidentified flying object.;43.5099;-86.3457
