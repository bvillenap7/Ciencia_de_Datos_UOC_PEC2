My girlfriend then said,&quot look, there's a 2nd one. I initally saw one very bright light that looked like a very bright satellite.  My girlfriend then said, look, there's a 2nd one flying with it.  And then we saw a 3rd light. The three lights were flying in,a large triangle formation in a Northern direction. The sorthernmost light was much brighter than the other two, bit then quickly the front light became the brightest. After about 30 seconds the lead light shot across the sky.  It looked just like a dim shooting star. The other two lights quickly faded away. I have no explation as to what earthly objects or craft/crafts would be capable of what we witnessed.;43.5099;-86.3457
