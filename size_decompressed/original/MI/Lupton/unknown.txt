I powered up my phone and began taking photos in the direction of the flashes and the sounds we heard coming from the grassy area.  The only adjustment to the photo was a slight increase of light exposure to sharpen the image. ((NUFORC Note:  We see no evidence in the photo that is suggestive to us of the presence of aliens, or alien spacecraft.  We are still corresponding with the witness.  PD));44.3979;-83.9889
