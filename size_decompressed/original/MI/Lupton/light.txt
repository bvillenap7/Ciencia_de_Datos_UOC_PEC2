Bright hovering object with red lights- erratic pattern of movement;2002-02-04 19:00:00;3+ hours;Bright hovering object with red lights- erratic pattern of movement about 6:30 pm a bright light appeared in the southeast sky- it moved quickly at first, heading northeast- very erratically- zig zagging back and forth, then has since seemed to hover in one spot, but moves slowly now and then. It's sitting at about 25 degrees, and at 8 pm it is still there. Visible without binoculars- It's not a star/planet nor any kind of satellite- appears to be blueish white with red lights flashing around it in some kind of a circular motion. I emailed a friend that lives south of me here in Michigan, about 50 miles south and she is observing it too- ((NUFORC Note:  Please see similar reports for this date.  PD));44.3979;-83.9889
