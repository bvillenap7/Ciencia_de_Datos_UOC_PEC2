I was to afraid to look out my window.  I heard what sounded like a large craft very low in the sky over my house.  I thought maybe it was an airplane about to crash.  The noise changed to almost a kind of bells and backup beeps - a combination of it.  I've never heard anything like it.  It than sounded again like a craft hovering and sounded like it went North.  I was up for two hours expecting to see a crash or something out of ordinary.  There wasn't a crash or any kind of an emergency landing.  I called the city police the next morning to see what it was or if anyone else reported it.  No one did.  I know I was not dreaming.  I live right by the Soo Locks.;46.4150999999999;-84.2854000000005

It reappeared a few seconds later up and a ways west of where it had previously been coming back it shifted direction seemed to grow brighter for a moment shifted again and then after moving a bit disappeared again.  There was a plane in the area immediately after it disappeared the second time.  I don't think it was chasing it though.  I could hear the plane. I couldn't hear the other thing.
