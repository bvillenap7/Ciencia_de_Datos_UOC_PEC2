UFO with rectangular  2 section construction seen in daylight by several people;2006-06-28 11:15:00;1 hour;UFO with rectangular  2 section construction seen in daylight by several people I came home at approximately 11-11:30am to find my neighbor and his mother in law looking through bonoculars at what he said must be a ufo or satelite or something. I was handed the bonoculars to look for myself.  What I saw was a flying object that I could not identify.  It was 2 sections, the front or first section was a rectangle with an off center point ( there is a name for this rectangle that escapes me.) The 2nd section or end was a longer thinner rectangle about maybe 3 times as long with a different surface than the first. The first appeared to be a solid material, the 2nd was a more open con-struction like a cell tower would look. My neighbor saw a piece from the end section go up and attach to the front. At that moment he called the police,who did not respond until his mother in law ( who is the wife of a policeman) called again. I am a hairdresser, age 52. My neighbor is in his late twenties or so, he owns his own company, ((company name deleted)), his mother in law , as I said, is the wife of a city policeman.;46.4150999999999;-84.2854000000005
