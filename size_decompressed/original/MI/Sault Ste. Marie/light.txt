bright light followed by illuminated trail;2002-05-09 00:15:00;1 to 2 minutes;((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this pilot at length, and found him to be an exceptionally qualified observer.  We believe the pilots who reported this event probably had witnessed space debris returning through the atmosphere.  Please see the following URL for details:   http://www.spaceref.com/redirect.ref?url=www.aero.org/cords/&id=1634 We express our gratitude to the FAA for directing the pilots to NUFORC, and to the crew members for having contacted us with their reports.  PD)) bright light followed by illuminated trail At 00:15 local time, 04:15 GMT, on the morning of May the 9th,I was the Captain of a B747-400 enroute from JFK to Vancouver. We had passed overhead of Toronto and were proceeding in a straight line from Toronto to Vancouver. We were flying at FL390, and making good a track of about 300 degrees magnetic. It was a clear night, no moon, and many stars visible. When we were south of Sault Ste. Marie by about 80 nautical miles, I suddenly observed two large bright white lights in our 1 o'clock position.  At first I thought they were two aircraft in formation flying towards us. They seemed to be about 8 to 10 miles away. I brought them to the attention of the F/O, and we both agreed that they were very unusual. I then asked air traffic control if they were aware of any aircraft in the area, and they said that there was nothing in the area either on radar or know of. We observed them for at least one minute, possibly close to two minute. They appeared as very bright white objects followed by a very long trail. The trail appeared to be about ten times the length of the object. The trail seemed to be illuminated, almost phosphorescent in color. The objects seemed to be brilliant white in color, and I felt I could see one or two individual white lights for a split second on the second object. They appeared to be in formation proceeding in a northeasterly direction at about our altitude. We watch them move from our 1 o'clock position to our 3 or 4 o'clock position, then the second object seemed to become two (perhaps one was hidden by the other), the second and third objects suddenly disappeared from sight and the lead object carried on for about 15 seconds more, then it disappeared as well. I have been flying for more than 25 years, and have operated all over the world I have never seen anything that looked like this before.;46.4150999999999;-84.2854000000005
Three strange lights appear in sky between the U.S. A and Canada to be shortly followed by scrambled Jet.;2003-08-06 22:05:00;25 mins;Three strange lights appear in sky between the U.S. A and Canada to be shortly followed by scrambled Jet. last nite 08/06/03,I  was getting ready for work just after 10pm. I shut off the fan in my bedroom window. I looked out the window to observe a dredging crew positioned in the first lock  -of the sault locks-. In the sky to my north closer to the Canadian side of the river approx 1/2 miles away i saw a bright light. a secon or two later i noticed another light coming across the eastern part of my viewing area . the second light crossed the horizon e to west to the same general area just north of my position. these lights went back and forth up and down in the night sky back and forth across my vewing area. from th american side to the canadian side. I called my wife to come and watch the lights. A my wife came to the front door to watch the strange lights with me a third light appeared from the west over the international bridge.I thought what in the heck are they ,they definately were not airplanes as they moved too eratic. I figured maybe they were Cost guard helicopters as from time to time they do go up the river to the coast guard base. But these lights would get brighter and dim out flash very brightly and fly eratic patterns east to west north to south around each other.. My wife an i thought that maybe theywere choppers and it was a serch and rescue mission in the saint mary's river.We observed them for about 25 mins. and they one by one would go west from our view over the international bridge a quarter mile west of us . the last one went back and forth across our viewing area east to west and back a couple of times before it left our site. I had to rush like a madman to get ready for work at this time as it was 10:30 at approx 10: 50 pm I got in my car backed out of my garage put my car in drive got about 50 feet down my alley, i felt and heard a loud rumbling, stopped my car stuck my head out of the window of my car to see the bottom of a large jet fighter going over my car -maybe 2 to3 hundred feet in the air above me  it scrambled west over the bridge in the direction tha! t the lights went.;46.4150999999999;-84.2854000000005
It was a large light, bigger than any other in the sky, going from SW to NE at a fast speed zig zaging here and occured at 12:40 AM on;2004-06-07 00:40:00;30 seconds to 1 Minute;It was a large light, bigger than any other in the sky, going from SW to NE at a fast speed zig zaging here and occured at 12:40 AM on It was a clear night no clouds in the sky.It was the day of my 8th grade Graduation and I just wanted to relax after a long day. My Father and I went to the ((deleted)) Store and got a few snacks. We Sat on our porch and started talking. I looked at my dog rolling around in the grass. Then, I looked up into the night sky. There was a big Orange-Redish ball of light passing above my neighbors' houses. It was coming from a South Westernly direction and continued moving to the North East. My father jumped up and said What ((deleted)) is that!?! It was moving faster than any satilite that I had ever seen in my Life. Occasionally it would Zig zag here and there. When We could see it no more, I ran inside my house and looked at the clock. I got the Time. It was around 12:40. Then I ran  back outside and I saw a plane that was going from East and going west at a normal speed. Compared to the UFO I had seen, the plane was extremely Slow.

Light in the sky disappears;2005-12-13 17:28:00;5-10 seconds;Light in the sky disappears I noticed a ball of yellowish-green light with a very small tail moving quickly across the sky (The tail may have been an illusion because it was moving so quickly).   It was about the size of a pea and very low in the sky.  I pointed it out to my boyfriend, and he saw it too.  Then a few seconds later, it broke up like it disintegrated and was gone.   We both were confused, yet amazed!!!  We have no idea what it could be!  He thought it looked like a missle, but I thought the only thing it could have been was a meteor.  Still don't know what it was!   Another strange thing that happened 45 minutes earlier, was a huge boom (like a cannon) sounded throughout town and shook the houses.  Many people heard and felt it from miles apart, but no one knew what it was. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed.  We would welcome other reports.  Please see other reports for this date.  PD));46.4150999999999;-84.2854000000005
Another light in the sky disappears;2005-12-18 18:14:00;10 seconds;Another light in the sky disappears Again, I have seen another light in the sky that suddenly disappears - just 5 days apart.  Tonight, I looked up because a big light in the sky caught my eye (about the size of a pea, but in an egg formation).   I thought to myself, Wow, what a huge star, or maybe it is a planet.  Then I kept looking because I thought it might be moving upwards. Then a few seconds later, it closed in and the light was gone.  It is very strange to see this happen twice in only five days.;46.4150999999999;-84.2854000000005

After work when I got to my hotel Kewadin hotel and casino I had sent my friend I was with the photos of the sunset I had took on the roof.  The next day he had looked at the photo and pointed out an object in the sky.  I looked at the photo and I seen a ball of light in the distance.  The second photo it appeared to be closer with some type of Ora around the glowing object.  I didn’t think much of it at the time and let it be.  I just arrived back to Chicago where I lived and went through my photos of that sunset  I didn’t realize it until now that when I hold the pictures they have a live feed for a couple seconds and in both I see it move it! ways I can’t even Comprehend. I thought it was very interesting and can’t get it off my mind now and wanted to reassure myself by letting someone know.;46.4150999999999;-84.2854000000005
