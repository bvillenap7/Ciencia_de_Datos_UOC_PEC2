Three black sphere's in northern michigan caught on camera;2000-06-15 17:30:00;?;Three black sphere's in northern michigan caught on camera I had gone out in front of my house with a digital camera, to take a series of phtotgraphs, to try out a new panoramic photo construction program for my computer. I took a total of 11 photo's, in a 360 degree circle from the ground to the sky using a tripod, at about 5:30 in the evening EST.  I then went back in the house, copied the jpg. photo's from the disk in the camera onto my hard drive, and constructed the panorama. As I was scrolling around in a circle, I could see a small black dot in the sky to the West. The program allows you to zoom in, so when I did this, the dot appears to be a black sphere. I zoomed out and scrolled to the left (north), and there were 2 more black sphere's. In the photo, they almost appear to be in a large triangle formation. I would estimate the size of them in the photo to be about the size of a pencil eraser held at arms length. ...Also, around the time I was getting the camera ready to go, I heard a jet streak overhead, but couldn't see it due to the low cloud level.  I live in an area where that is out of the ordinary, and you stick your head out the window to see what kind of jet it is. I have the photo...72dpi - 768x1024 pixels...someone needs to see this;46.4150999999999;-84.2854000000005
