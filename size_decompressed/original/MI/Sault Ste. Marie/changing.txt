Orb of light noticed that wasn't appearing on google sky map.  Me and my friend looked at out for a minute and noticed it changing hues of light between an orange, white, and slightly yellowed colors. Orb seemed to remain in general area in sky from where we can see.  It wasn't there north star which I could clear see as well.  The orb of light changes colors and slightly changes shape while moving.  Moves in all directions and dims out and gains distant, then comes closer and becomes much brighter fairly frequently.;46.4150999999999;-84.2854000000005
