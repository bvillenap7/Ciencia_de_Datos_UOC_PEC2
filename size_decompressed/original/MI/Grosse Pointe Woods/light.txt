3 lights seen over Lake St. Claire in Michigan.;2006-10-08 23:00:00;30min-1hr;3 lights seen over Lake St. Claire in Michigan. We were driving along in the Car on our way back from the Movie theatre heading south, and two lights became visible in the night sky. The Lights left an extremely thick trail of smoke behind them and dissappeared. The trail left behind it was almost parrallel to the ground but slanted toward the earth some. The objects looked like they fell into the lake and one of the objects was spiriling as it appeared to fall. We drove south until we reached the edge of Lake St. Claire, when a third smaller light shaped like the others appeared in the night sky. This third light was within feet of where the others went down, however the trail this light left was perpendicular to the earth and appeared to be going straight into the lake and then dissappeared. The lights appeared to be oarange, blue, and a yellowish color. The lights dissappeared, but the trails were visible from miles away from, where the event occured.;42.4263;-82.9014
