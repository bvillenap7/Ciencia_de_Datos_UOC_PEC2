At about 1:22, I saw a large, orange light shoot across the raceway in Milan, Michigan, a county-like little town.  This was in the very early hours of Independence Day of 2008.  I pointed it out to my stepfather, and his friend.  My stepfather believed it to be a fast-paced military chopper, or something. It was too fast for a chopper, for I live in a place where helicopters are common.  Plus there is no military base in the quaint town of Milan.  After going about 20 miles past the racetrack, the craft hovered and dimmed out. If I could guess the speed, I would say that it was clocking at 100, maybe 110 MPH. I heard nothing, due to the roar of the car engines that night. I’ll never forget it, and I’ve been thinking about it ever since then, and then I found this site. I hope this report does some good.;42.0906;-83.6819
