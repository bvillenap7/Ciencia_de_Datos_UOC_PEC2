Pulsating light, changing color.  Moving slowly to the left and right.  Shaped like a light bulb. Saw what appeared at first as bright star directly overhead.  Told the wife it was too bright out (full sunlight) to see even the brightest star.  It was moving very very slow, to the left and then to the right.   I got out my binoculars and it appeared to be perhaps a weather balloon except it had a very bright light that would pulsate a bit and change color, red, blue, green , orange.  The light was at the base and above the bright light it was opaque and you could sort of see through it.  It was rather shaped like an old fashioned light bulb.   It was in the sky for about an hour and then all of a sudden it rose higher in the sky and it disappeared rather quickly.  I am going to guess it was at around 35,000 feet.   In my 57 years, I have never ever seen anything like this.  Over the past few weeks, I have seen a military F-18 Hornet flying overhead at various times during the day.  I wonder if they are looking for what I saw last evening.;42.0906;-83.6819
