Small Strobes that Flare to many times their size & brightness;2002-08-10 22:45:00;10 minutes;Small Strobes that Flare to many times their size & brightness We saw 8 - 10 strobes in the distance & assumed they were airplanes.  But we watched because so many were in a relatively small area of the sky.  As we watched, one of them flared up from a very small strobe to about the width of a full moon near the horizon and about 1/4 as thick as wide.  The Flare color was very bright yellow - orange and lasted about 5 - 10 seconds and seemd to be composed of 1 to 3 lights (we saw 5 sets altogether).  I got a pair of 50X binoculars to get a better look & noticed the Airplanes were not traveling in straight lines, some reversed direction & followed others, some moved toward each other & then turned together in a different direction. They seemed to be simply milling about.  We saw 5 flares, the first appeared to be 3 or 4 Lights the last 3 were single or double lights. they were about 2 minutes apart. When one of them flared the strobe or Airplane vanished.  After the last one flared the Airplanes dispersed gradually. Since this was 22:45 and I was looking toward the east, these could not be reflections from the sun. This Morning 08/19/02 at 06:25 My wife & I saw 3 very bright lights with a strobe above the center one traveling very rapidly across the sky. I could see no red or green lights and the body was not visible even though the object appeared quite close. I was an air traffic controler in the Air Force & would estimate these lights at about 2 miles away.  The first ones in this report were 10 or more miles away from the looks of the strobe & assuming they were airplanes.;45.1583;-85.1354
