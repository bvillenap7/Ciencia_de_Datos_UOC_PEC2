My wife and I were sitting outside having a campfire. We were enjoying the night sky when we noticed what appeared to be a satellite moving across the sky at around 11:23pm. It was white and the same size and as the stars. To our amazement there was another one right after the first and then another, continuing for about 18 to 20 in total. These were moving much faster than a plane in the sky and did not have any flashing lights. They were all in a straight line and equally spaced apart. We tried to capture the event with our phone to no avail. The line started in the southwest sky and passed over us to the northeast sky.  When the event ended we were mystified and talked about what it could be. We continued to stay outside until 2am and saw the same line of satellite shapes pass again at 12:53 but this time they were further north from where we were. The 3rd time this happened it was even more north than the 2nd time and the event was around 1:40.  We would like to know what these were as we have never seen that many satellites in the sky at one time and all moving roughly the same distance apart and in a straight line.;45.1583;-85.1354
