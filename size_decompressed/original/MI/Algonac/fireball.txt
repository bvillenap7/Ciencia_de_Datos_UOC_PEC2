In the sky not too high up over one of the canals...what looked to be a ball of fire,  Orange and yellow in color, no sound.  Moved slowly south, then shifted direction west. Couldn't have been too far from the ground and just lifted. Stayed in the sky for about 5 minutes, maybe more.  Got smaller which I'm guessing was going higher up, and split into 3 lights, forming a triangle... orange lights.  It floated for another minute I'd say before It dimmed in and out, then to just disappear. 8 witnesses.  Maybe a few more across the canal who were in their back yard.;42.6374;-82.5764
