I was awoken by my sisters at 4:15 in the morning, to look at the strange light inthe sky.  There in the eastren sky over Canada, their was three lights which apeared to be toghter, that formed a trangle. within only a few seconds its lights decreased in intensity and faded into the intensity of a normal star.  Then faded completely.  Then it came back never geting as bright as the frist time I seen it, but was brighter than any star in the sky. It contined to do this over and over until it tolaly faded away. ((NUFORC Note:  Flaw in date.  There is no June 31st.  We have amended the date above.  Report May be a hoax, we wonder.
