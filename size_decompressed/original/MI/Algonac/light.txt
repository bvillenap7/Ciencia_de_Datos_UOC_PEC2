bright object bacame 8 separate objects and flew off in separate directions;1992-08-29 18:00:00;3 MINUTES;bright object bacame 8 separate objects and flew off in separate directions I noticed a large bright object to the north of my position. I thought that it may be a planet but it was very bright. I watched it and aproximately after 1 minute, the bright object became 7-8 smaller objects which flew in a downward motion then outward and up, in a J fashion and disappeared. The motion resembled an upsidedown open umbrella. All lights moved in a synchonized fashion. My first thought that an aerobatics team such as the Blue Angels or the Snowbirds were rehearsing. The next day at work I checked the NOTAM (notices to airmen) Board. There were no practices in our airspace on that date and no airshows scheduled around that time. I was working in Air Traffic Services at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD));42.6374;-82.5764
Algonac lights on 7-15-06 evening;2006-07-15 23:00:00;30 seconds;Algonac lights on 7-15-06 evening About 10:30 - 11:00PM while camping at Algonac State Park around a campfire and looking at the passing of stars/satellites, everyone noticed a very bright star light immediately appearing about 1/2 way up the horizon in the Northeast.  Over the Ontario side of the St. Clair River.  It was very bright almost like a jet with it's landing lights on and sort of moving towards us in the heavens.  All 4 of us saw it as it was very bright for about 4 seconds and moved south as if the speed of a satellite.  It then continued and got dim (like a satellite) about 5 seconds later, it appeared to break into two different satellite like lights and moved in 2 different directions at satellite speeds.  The two objects then moved out of view traveling two different directions to the south.;42.6374;-82.5764
