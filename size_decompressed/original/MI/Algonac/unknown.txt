Four of us had gotten back from a boat ride and I had gotten out my 20x80 binocs and my 10x50's. two of us were looking up into a clear starry night when in the direction of Casseopeia a starlike craft, not in our atmosphere went by heading north to south. We were looking for sattelites because that is usually where they fly by frequently, but this was way to fast for a sattelite. This covered the distance from horizon to horizon about three times faster than any sattelite that I have witnessed yet. Almost too fast to track with a tripod. It definitely wasn't ours. I live by Selfridge Airbase and have seen doughnuts on a rope stuff before, this left no signature, and it's not the first sighting that I have had. I had previously seen a U.F.O. through my 13 aperture scope. You would have to ask me about that one!;42.6374;-82.5764
