Then 15 to 20 min later we saw it again this time it was on the southern sky flying towards us at a slow rate of speed it was about the size of a military fighter it had no faa lights it flew over us about 500 to 1000 feet with no sound it had a orange pulsating light on the bottom of it that covered the entire bottom of it when it pulsated you could just make out a teardrop shape to it. Then it did a 90 deg turn towards the eastern horizon stopped pulsed red three or four time and faded away. Then during the fireworks it reappeared in the western sky and this time it hovered in one place during the entire fireworks show which is 25 to 30min long then it pulsed red three to four times and faded away;42.313043478261;-85.1845400000002
