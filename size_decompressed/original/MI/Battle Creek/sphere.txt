Glowing sphere seen in the day time sky over Battle Creek, Michigan.;2010-12-06 16:30:00;2 hours;Glowing sphere seen in the day time sky over Battle Creek, Michigan. Me & my children seen a bright star like object during the day hovering low in the sky. There wasn't any clouds in the sky, so it was very easy to see. I would've said it was a star other than it was during the day time. I ran back into my house and got my camera and took several photos of it. It seemed to move a litte bit while I was snapping pictures of it. After a few minutes of starring at it, the glowing sphere got closer to us. So then I took some more pictures of it. This was defenetley a foo fighter looking UFO. There was no sound and it stayed almost perfectley still. It remained in almost the same spot for hours even after the sun went down. Once it became night time, It was still there. Then I went in doors for a few minutes and came back out and it was gone.;42.313043478261;-85.1845400000002
