Driving home and noticed what seemed to be a still craft, and I immediately did not recognize the light sequence to be anything Id ever seen from a plane.  I called my friend who lives probly a mile or so down the road.  He went outside and thought the same thing about the lighting of this craft.  It was Red, Yellow and White I would say but its like you could always see one of the lights flicker (but it wasnt a really quick flicker near the slower end for a flying object) Red then yellow then white then red etc, but this craft was out of sight in no time at all, it went from pretty much not moving to out of sight within about 15-20secs. I came inside thinking it was all over but the friend I called, contacted another friend about the incident he lives about 2miles from us. They went back out approx. 15mins after the initial sighting and they saw two of this same craft with the same lighting scheme in the sky now. IM not sure how long they were in sight but the! y were forsure spotted. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of twinkling star??  PD));42.313043478261;-85.1845400000002

Bright white circular craft flying fast above the clouds until it disappeared.;2011-10-02 18:00:00;5 minutes;Bright white circular craft flying fast above the clouds until it disappeared. Me and my 8 year old son were sky watching when we spotted a commercial jet flying and right next to it flying in a diaginal direction toward the jet was a small bright white circular object.  It was moving at least twice as fast as the jet and was a few thousand feet higher that it as well.  We watched this object for about 3 or 4 minutes, then it was too far to see.  Twenty minutes later we seen an object that looked much the same as the last, except it was flying at a lower altitude.  This one we watched fly for a minute and then it stopped and hovered for about 20 seconds and then just completely disappeared like a bubble popping.  We were completely shocked!  Over the last month we've been seeing a lot of these kind of sightings but never 2 in one day like this!;42.313043478261;-85.1845400000002
