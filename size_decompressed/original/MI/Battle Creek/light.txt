The light showed bright through the dense snow storm.;1993-01-15 23:00:00;1 plus hrs.;The light showed bright through the dense snow storm. During the winter of '93, sometime towards the end of Jan., a friend of mine, my younger brother, and my self were outside in my parents drive way.  My parents were gone on a winter vacation.  On this particular night it was snowing quite heavily.  The three of us were out side talking, (as my friend was about to leave), when my friend saw a bright light in the western sky.  At first we thought nothing of it.  As we stood there talking for about five minutes, the light never moved from its position.  At that point we relized it was not a plane.   Now, we were not really talking but paying close attention to the object.  There was no sound and it did not move from it's position in the air.  As I said it was snowing quite hard and would not have been a star.   My brother became very scared and ran back into the house.  Shortly there after my friend and I felt it would be best if he left.  I went back in the house.   When my friend arrived at his home he called me.  He told me as he drove east back towards his house, which was about 15 miles to the east of my parents house, he lost sight of the light.   After some pressure from my friend, he got me to go out to check and see if the light was still there.  I went out and looked and the light was still in the air.  It was snowing harder and the light was brighter.  I was immediatly froze in my tracks, and chills ran through my body.  I was on the cordless phone with my friend and when I didn't say any thing he started yelling.   I snapped out of it and told him it was there.  So we stayed on the phone together as I watched the object.   After about thirty minutes, I could not take the cold any longer and had to return inside.  The light was still in the sky when I went back in to the house.  I had witnessed odd lights in the night sky before, but nothing ever like this and nothing this extrordinary since.

Bright light stays in one spot for a few seconds then dims and disappears within 3 sec.;2004-11-07 16:22:00;20 sec.;Bright light stays in one spot for a few seconds then dims and disappears within 3 sec. I was headed west on I-94 towards Chicago from the direction of Detroit.  At mile marker 90 I had looked up and noticed a bright light in the sky just North of due West.  This was at the same elevation of the sun at that moment in time.   If I had to guess it was in the direction of Battle Creek but the distance was not clear, maybe 10-25 miles away from my location.  What I saw was a bright light in the sky at first glance I believed it to be a airplane.   After closer observation I had noticed no trails in the sky and that the bright light was not moving.   After observing for nearly 20 sec. (It could have been in the sky longer but was not recognized by me until then) in the last 3 sec. of observation the bright light reduced in size 1/2 by each sec. and dimmed more and more.  In a matter of 3 sec. this bright object was gone.  It traveled in a path directly away from me, towards the great lake of Michigan.   If anyone has connections to confirm this sighting with the air control personal at Battle Creek Airport.;42.313043478261;-85.1845400000002
Steady glowing red light moving irradically across sky with varying degrees of brightness.;2017-03-10 05:55:00;5 minutes;Steady glowing red light moving irradically across sky with varying degrees of brightness. Noticed a steady glowing red light in the sky moving east to west with a zig zag before it moved out of sight behind trees on the horizon.  Red light was not blinking.  The red light would however vary in intensity.;42.313043478261;-85.1845400000002
Large Moving Bright Red Light Over Battle Creek;2020-01-22 19:18:00;2 minutes;Large Moving Bright Red Light Over Battle Creek It was dark outside. I went out to smoke a cigarette and saw a round bright red light, not flashing, moving slowly towards me from north to south.  It was in the direction of the airport here, but it did not have the required red light on the left wing and green light on the right. It also did not have any type of rotating beacon light.  It was maybe 5 miles distant at about 3000'. It maneuvered slowly and strangely.  It never got closer to me than maybe 3 miles (?).  It made no sound, and as it was quiet outside, I likely would have been able to hear it at the estimated distance, like other aircraft I have seen out at the airport (KBTL). It turned towards the north and the light faded quite rapidly and became white. The main thing strange I noticed was the unusually bright red light.  I have seen bright WHITE landing lights on aircraft, but never a very bright red one (I am a pilot and aircraft dispatcher and have been involved with aviation my entire life).  This is not my first report on this site. I just wanted to post here to see if anyone else saw this.  I told my friend about it, who lives in the city of Coldwater (about 30 miles southeast of me.  He said he too saw it about 30 minutes later over his town, off to east (a bright non-flashing red light).  I checked flightaware.com and saw no aircraft matching the flight profile I witnessed.  I filmed it with my iphone6, a bit through the trees and have included it here.;42.313043478261;-85.1845400000002
Strange blue lights from the sky;2020-10-13 05:00:00;Weeks?;Strange blue lights from the sky Hello, I’m writing you because I just started a new job working at a hotel in Battle Creek,Mi and last week I saw the blue light while taking a picture of the moon while outside on my break and I thought something was wrong with my phone camera. I was off for the rest of the week until last night and I just went out (5:00 am) to take another break and this was my first time seeing the moon all night, and I noticed a small light underneath the moon that was not there last week, so I took a picture and oddly that same blue light was back. I took a closer up picture and it was still there in the same place it was last week. You cannot see this blue light without the camera. I did not use any filters on the camera either I usually don’t so I can capture the true beauty of the moon. Could someone maybe take a look at this and tell me what they think it could be? I came to the conclusion that it’s definitely not a bug  because there was nothing flying in front of ! my phone.;42.313043478261;-85.1845400000002
