Just befor Three Rivers I spotted this 90 degree contrail being formed. I told my wife and we pulled into a parking lot and I took the picture of it. Latter on near Battle Creek MI my wife spotted the S shaped contrail being formed. I pulled off the road and handed he my camera. She too the photograph of the S shaped contrail. At both times we could not see any aircraft or any sunlite hitting a aircraft. I have reported this event to Linda Moulton How and she has a taped interview with along with the photographs. You can contact her for any further information. I noticed this right angle contrail in the Eastern sky starting from the zenith down then made an abrupt left hard turn. I had on my yellow night driving sun glasses  as it was overcast. I have seen contrails all my life as we live in the flight path between O'hare and the Detroit international airports. This was the most amazing thing that I had ever seen. The S shaped contrail happened farther down the road near Battle Creek MI. Again this is not normal commercial air traffic. I have aslo taken X contrail photographs. I have been in contact with Linda Moulton Howe and she has a taped interview with me on her WEB page. You mau contact her if you wish. I have been an amateur astronomer for over 30 years and I do know that meteors and comets do non make turns.;42.313043478261;-85.1845400000002
Triangular Lights;2021-03-12 01:47:00;~2 hours;Triangular Lights I was outside my house smoking a cigarette. I was looking at the stars and just admiring how bright they all were shining. Then I noticed one that seemed to be moving and I thought it was just my eyesight at first. I then called my husband and asked him to come look. When he confirmed that he was seeing it, I knew it was real. We were looking East at the first sighting of a rapid moving light form. Then we noticed there was one looking North. I took videos, zoomed in and they looked like those orbs you see when you take a photo, except they were out in the sky not floating around here. There were also multiple lights rapidly moving around these 2 and then disappearing. The craziest thing was these 3 blue lights flying around and I could not see them with my own eyes, but caught them on camera, BUT my husband could see them!!  We were so shocked by what we were seeing, never ever in my life have witnessed anything like this. I know this seems crazy, I couldn't! believe it myself! We watched this happen for almost 2 hrs, they would disappear and then come back. Eventually I got really cold, so I can't confirm how long they were in the sky. I wish I was confident to say a UFO.  drones, planes, helicopters? That's what everyone keeps telling me. If that were true, it just doesn't make sense on how they looked, how many were there, and why they weren't moving directions. ;42.313043478261;-85.1845400000002
