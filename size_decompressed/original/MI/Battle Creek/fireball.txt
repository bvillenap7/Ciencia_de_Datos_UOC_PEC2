Bright Green Fire Ball with long tail falling from the sky;2002-08-10 22:00:00;4 seconds;Bright Green Fire Ball with long tail falling from the sky We live in the country, and were on our way home one evening going north.  All of a sudden in the northern sky we saw a very bright green fire ball with a long tale go across the sky in a downword motion very fast like a falling star.  It lasted about 4 seconds then disappeared.   Than around 3 weeks later we saw another one with the same discription in the western sky. These objects are the greenest green i have ever seen.;42.313043478261;-85.1845400000002
Green fireball over the trees in Battle Creek Michigan.;2011-07-26 20:45:00;2 seconds;Green fireball over the trees in Battle Creek Michigan. All I could see was a green fireballball that seemed to drop from the sky and went behind some trees.  That is all I saw and I did not think anything of it until later when I realized that it was not a normal thing.;42.313043478261;-85.1845400000002
Fireball in sky above cemetery changing colors orange and red!;2014-06-03 21:30:00;10 minutes;Fireball in sky above cemetery changing colors orange and red! We were heading down M-66 North and I could see in the distance a weird fireball in the sky. When we approached the ball it was hovering above the cemetery (before White Rabbit Rd) about 70 feet in the air. We pulled in to watch, the ball hovered and turned orange and red. It then started to ascend in the sky higher still changing colors and finally disappeared after about ten minutes. It was way above the tree lines when it disappeared about 200 feet or more up. There were other people in the cemetery that night but none of them seemed to notice what was above them?  My sons were with me ages 12 and 14 and verify the same thing!;42.313043478261;-85.1845400000002
