The lights on some of them would be bright and like a disc around them and then we saw the light get real dim and small, stop and hoover.   Ferris wheel in the sky with a electrical short.   After watching them long enough i saw a pattern.  There were est 4 spaced equally in a straight line higher in sky , while two at a time evenly spaced, would take off fast and high. they would repeat this over and over while multiple low flying ones never left area. including one big bright one hoovering back and forth at a 5 mile distance extremly low. I saw the same thing in a video shot 3 days ago in texas. That same thing was in my back yard tonight.;42.1928;-86.2573
