My friend mentioned it, like, WTF IS THAT?, and we ended up pulling over to look at it. What we saw was 3 bright white lights in a triangle shape, extremely close together. It was obviously at a very high altitude. None of the lights were flashing, and the object was not moving.  We ended up going to 2 liqour stores, we saw it before we got to the first one, at the first one, and at the second one, and after we got home. It was at the same place in the sky each time I checked for it, but when I was looking at it at home, it started descending until I couldn't see it over the woods.;42.1928;-86.2573
