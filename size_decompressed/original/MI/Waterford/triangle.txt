I then glanced out again and noticed three lights in a triangle fashion.  I could clearly see the outline of the dark craft from the night sky behind it.  The craft moved behind some trees about 40-50 yards from the window, and the craft appeared about the size of larger than a semitruck.  The lights stayed a steady dull light of the three lights.  kind of like street lights about 2-3 blocks away.  after a few seconds I got up and went to the front bathroom that is in the bedroom, and open the front window and actualy from the waist up was out the window, a few planes in the distant and a small jetlike plane following in the pathe of the craft. there was clouds in the sky to the south east so I couls no longer see the craft.  I am not sure what it was but it was large and ominous.  ((name deleted));42.6586123809523;-83.3787323809524
2 triangular crafts, appearing about 20 minutes about, fast moving, with one green light and two alternately strobing white lights;2005-08-15 23:00:00;about 2 minutes;2 triangular crafts, appearing about 20 minutes about, fast moving, with one green light and two alternately strobing white lights Starting around 23:00 hour, while I was outside talking on my cell phone, a strange, fast-moving, nearly silent object appeared to the east of me on the horizon.   As far as I could tell because of the lights, it had a triangular shape, but I can't be positive.  There were 3 lights on the craft: white, alternately strobing lights in the front and back and one green light that completed the triangle.  The strangest thing about this craft is that it covered the WHOLE SPAN OF THE HORIZON in less than 2 minutes.  To my knowledge, no plane can move that fast.   About 20 minutes later, I was still outside and another of the same crafts appeared.  As this was happening, my little sister was walking outside to get something out of the car.  I pointed to the sky and she screamed to her friend on the phone, Holy sh*t, there's a UFO in the sky!   Again, this craft traversed the whole span of the horizon, again traveling from east to west as the other craft had. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been looking at either aircraft at altitude, or perhaps satellites.  PD));42.6586123809523;-83.3787323809524
Waterford MI sighting of triangle shaped craft;2006-10-18 23:00:00;2-3 minutes;Waterford MI sighting of triangle shaped craft I saw some sort of triangular craft with lights in different directions hovering over M-59 in Waterford near Pontiac Lk. Rd.   I rolled down the window in my car to see if I could hear it, thinking it was a helicopter.  It was completely silent and just hovering in one spot maybe 70-100 feet off the ground.  I was at a red light waiting at that intersection and when the light changed none of the cars went on green because they were all staring at it like me.  I pulled off the road in disbelief and a few seconds later it hovered over M-59, and headed south over some buildings.  I watched it go completely out of sight, and then looked at everyone as they all looked at one another to see if everyone saw it.  It looked about the size of a car from what I could tell. I'm completely weirded out now!;42.6586123809523;-83.3787323809524
Fast moving triangle ufo.;2014-11-30 18:00:00;10 seconds;Fast moving triangle ufo. Stopped at the traffic light on Voorheis Rd., crossing m59 going south I seen a object shaped like a triangle.  It was black with no lights flying very low aprox 100 feet above the homes. it was at a fast rate going east to west.   At first, it was very thin, then it looked as if it banked hard to go south.  That's when I seen its full size and triangle shape.   It was headed south west after it banked.  I lost sight after it banked cause of trees.  It was so low, I kept watching the area for a sign of crash or smoke.  I've never seen anything this low, fast, and strange before.   The craft seemed to be about 50 feet wide, and made no sound at all.;42.6586123809523;-83.3787323809524
