I looked and saw a sphere shaped object with many differntly colored rapidly flashing lights.;2000-07-25 23:37:00;25 minutes;I looked and saw a sphere shaped object with many differntly colored rapidly flashing lights. It was late on a warm night in July. I was outside my father's house with my step brother, brother, and grandfather. My step-brother was down by the lake while the rest of us were casually visiting about 50 yards away on the porch.  The silence of the night was broken by my step brother running up the hill from the lake. He told us to all look up in the sky pretty much strait out.  I looked and saw a sphere shaped object with many differntly colored rapidly flashing lights.  There was absolutely no noticable pattern to the flashing lights. The craft zipped back and forth in a zig zagging pattern at an uncomprehendable rate of speed. (it could not possibly have been a plane or a helicopter, it was moving way to fast!!!) After repeating this pattern for about 6 and a half minutes it stopped and hovered in the same spot for about another 3 minutes. A red ball of light was then lowered from the bottom of the craft and the craft repeated the zig zag pattern for another 7 minutes or so. The UFO then slowly made its way over to the rear left corner of the lake and hovered there for a couple of minutes. the craft then proceeded to drop a ball of light and the ball hit the ground and lit up the entire sky with bright flash. (I swear to god on all of this!!!) Throughout the entire account the craft did produce a sound that i or any member of my party could hear it was silent. The craft then proceeded to fly off to left more and I eventually lost sight as it flew by my house. I did not care to follow to the front of the house as I was pretty shaken by the entire expereience. The date my not be exact as this happened a long time ago but every thing I have stated here is absolutely true. The UFO was somewhat distant throughout the entire experience being as it was not a close encounter.;42.6586123809523;-83.3787323809524
Unidentifiable light(lights) moving uncharacteristically.......;2005-10-04 20:00:00;20 min;Unidentifiable light(lights) moving uncharacteristically....... Around eight i saw what appeared to be an airplane-however i know the flight patterns of the closest airport (pontiac airport) and this was not moving in the according paths....it was moving towards me(to the east) and was not flashing, blinking or changing altitude.  It stayed almost perfectly level and was glowing a bright orange.  The intensity of the glow vareied to almost white at times, then to a yellow again.  Thought it may have been a helicopter, but no sound.....Suddenly just blinked off/ dissappeared. Minutes later, in the exact same place, saw what appeared to be a comet/meteor shoot from the same spot in the sky down to the right(behind the tree-line). Kept watching and 2-3 min. later saw an extremely bright light rise up from where the meteor went to the ground. It rose straight up and then suddenly chaged direction to the left-immediately.  It traveled perfectly straight to the left(south) and kept going until out of sight,picking up speed until out of sight.  No clouds that night.  About 25 degrees and no wind(maybe 3-5 mph).  Very quiet outside....Within 5-10 min., two helicopters where combing the area(very discernable) for about 30-45 min.  Lots of stars(very clear) and great visability.  Still freaks me out as to what it was..... ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));42.6586123809523;-83.3787323809524
Multiple UFOs over 1 hour period of time.;2014-07-05 00:00:00;1 hour;Multiple UFOs over 1 hour period of time. During the fireworks display over Lake Oakland,  My sister niece and nephew witnessed Numerous balls of red lights in the sky.  All coming from east to west, but within a 10 to 15 mile radius of my house.  Consistently red glowing not blinking.  No sound moving in straight trajectories, in different directions.  Craziest thing I've ever seen in my life.  I have never been so excited before.  Absolutely not stars planes helicopters or balloons.  No sound whatsoever...absolutely amazing.  There has to be other people who saw these things. counted over 20 plus.  I recorded some with my cell phone but obviously those aren't great... with binoculars the lights were extremely intense with no variation.  I know what we saw was not from here.  One of the best nights of my life!;42.6586123809523;-83.3787323809524
