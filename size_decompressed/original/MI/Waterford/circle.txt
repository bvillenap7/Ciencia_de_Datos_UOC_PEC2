I also happen to know it wasn't a plane. There is a airport around but the planes always take off and land coming from the east and west and not the north and south.  I was also too far away from the airport that they could be circling.  The object was also too low to be a plane.;42.6586123809523;-83.3787323809524
UFO’s over Michigan.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-19 21:00:00;1 hour;UFO’s over Michigan Looked up in the sky to see 30 plus ufo spaces equally moving from southwest to north east all at the same speed and equal spacing. Then noticed same thing happening north to south. Still movement as I type this. Definitely not aircraft in our atmosphere and way way way to many to be any satellite or space station. Confirmed with a friend in a different county him and his family went outside and witnessed the same thing for over 40 minutes now.;42.6586123809523;-83.3787323809524
