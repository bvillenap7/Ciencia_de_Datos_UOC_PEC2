Stargazing on my deck and sighted what I thought at the time was a large green meteor (Largest I ever seen);1998-08-26 23:00:00;5 - 10 seconds;Stargazing on my deck and sighted what I thought at the time was a large green meteor (Largest I ever seen) I was stargazing on my back deck. My back yard is rather deep and is backed by a large wooded nature center. All of a sudden a Large Green Fireball appeared from the west and headed out of my sight to the east (Lost it in the tree line). It was about the size of your thumb at arms length. What struck me as strange was the green color and almost sparkler like quality of it. It didnt move as fast as other shooting stars Ive seen. I had it in view for about 5 seconds. I called for my wife to come see it, but she was too late. I scanned the papers and watched the news for the next couple of days, but no one reported anything.;42.6586123809523;-83.3787323809524
I witnessed a meteor / fireball that passed south of my location traveling from the West to the East at a fairly slow rate of speed.;1999-11-16 19:00:00;30 seconds;I witnessed a meteor / fireball that passed south of my location traveling from the West to the East at a fairly slow rate of speed. I was driving south bound when my wife asked what kind of aircraft is that? I had to duck down and look up to see what she was talking about. It was a great fireball with several small pieces breaking off and trailing behind it as it traveled from the West at 260' to the East at 080'. I had to look up at about a 50' angle to see it as it passed directly in front of my vehicle's position due south of me. I continued to follow it even after it stopped burning. It turned a dark amber and I could clearly see that it was a large, somewhat round, meteor. It disappeared into the haze at the horizon between 5 to 10' elevation. I would estimate its speed to be 4 times that of the space shuttle. It was visible for atleast 30 seconds if not longer as we did not see this from the start of the event. Several local TV stations have shown home video of it which I will send by UPS.;42.6586123809523;-83.3787323809524
