My wife and I had gone for a long bike ride today and went to park to rest.  We layed down flat and starred into the clear blue sky.  I saw a strange circular/saucer object moving very fast from south to north, and very high in the sky 15,000 ft?.  I pointed it out to my wife and she thought it was just a baloon at first, but it then it started to change directions and finally stopped and hovered (wobbeling) and moving short distances. I appeared white or perhaps silver in color (metallic?). Then we could not beleive it, a second indentical craft appeared out of no where and it appeared they began to chase one another in circles (less than a minute) then one the crafts just disapeared. Then the remaining craft acted bewildered as to the location of the other craft and just cruised slowly towards the west and then it appeared gain altitude rapidly straight up util it disapeared.  We have never witnessed anything like this before it was incredible!  Sorry, I would rather not submit contact info, I have already described in full detail everything that we had seen.;43.6403048387096;-84.2427556451612
