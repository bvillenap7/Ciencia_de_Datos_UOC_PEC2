The 1st time i was in back of building alone in a football field looking at stars smoking. i noticed a star moving. I thought it was a sattelite . then it changed direction. then it went in circles. then i saw another...and another and another. they were doing like figure 8's and flying around and seemed to be barely missing hitting eachother. then suddenly they were gone. every night at that time and place i strained to find then again but didn't and gave up. But on my lunch hour i got something to eat and parked in random apt. complex to eat. i heard a kid singing opera going haywire on the 4th floor balcony and looked and laughed. Then what i thought was a hawk caught my eye. but it seemed way too high to be any hawk...it was in the clouds. it was making rapid back & forth movements and right angles very quickly and looked black-not bird like. then i saw another and another till there was a whole swarm! and this was in broad daylight this time!! they put on the same 'airshow and swarmed around fast barely missing eachother. conveniently my cell phone phone would not work...and i swear a bird came along REAL close trying to distract me...cuz i looked really really fast at it and looked back and the all vanished!;43.6403048387096;-84.2427556451612
