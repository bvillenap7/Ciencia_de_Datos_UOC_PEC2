Non Blinking yellow light moves quickly across the sky;2005-07-29 22:00:00;2 -3 min;Non Blinking yellow light moves quickly across the sky Witnessed a light in the sky that could be described as yellow or gold. I t was moving from west to east faster than an airplane but slower than a meteor.  It moved across the sky quicker than a satelite but appeared much lower and larger. It looked about as big as the largest visible star but it was not real bright and did not blink or change colors.  As I was driving south I watched it head east and then arc to the south until I lost site of it behind the tree line.  Upon arriving home my wife and child were pulling in the drive at the same time as me.  I got out of the car and was looking at the sky and stars to see if I could see any other sign of this light. My son (age 7) asked what I was looking at, I told him that I was looking for a plane or something that I had seen on my way home.  He replied do you mean the fast yellow one that was going that way as he pointed to the southeast. He told me that he had seen it a few minutes ago too and asked his mother what it was. He knows what an airplane looks like and was excited to see something unusual. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.3577;-83.3747
