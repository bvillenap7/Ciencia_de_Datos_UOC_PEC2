Two adults and two children ages 9 and 11 were eating dinner in the back yard.    A comment was made about the beautiful sky and the dad looks up and sees a stationary single bright white round object at very high altitude almost directly over head.  Everyone saw it.   A few took a minute or so to located it.   It then appeared to vanish and reappear slightly northwest of its originally location.   Shortly after that, we all observed a variety of objects all moving from south to north about the same spot as the original object.   They appeared to move at constant altitude and speed.  A few of the objects seemed to flash brighter and dimmer.   We observed them until they went out of site beyond the trees.;42.5423315789474;-83.2130263157895
