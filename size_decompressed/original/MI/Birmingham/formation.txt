At 10:45 p.m., just after it became dark, we walked outside of our house and noticed several people looking up at the sky.  It was cloudless and the stars were out.  There was no wind. We looked up and observed 5 very large red round lights, about a mile up in the sky. They were about 3 times larger than a small plane.  We concluded this because as  we watched about 15 minutes into it, we saw a small aircraft racing towards the red crafts.  But they disappeared before the plane could catch up to them. They were silent the entire time, not pulsating but staying bright red and and slowly following in sync formation, from the North West to the North East. There may have been more than 5 red craft but we observed 5 by the time we walked outside and noticed them.  We estimated this line of formation was at least a mile in length.  I used a tree branch as a point of reference and watched them each disappear at the same point when they reached the tree branch. After 20 minutes, they disappeared completely and we all discussed what we just witnessed for about 10 minutes.  Everyone felt they were genuine UFO's because we knew there was no current technology at the time to be able to create such an event.  Then we drove to the closest police station and told the police they would think we were crazy because we jsut saw UFO's but they replied that they must be crazy too because they also watched them. I kept watching the local news and reading the local paper every morning and night and became frustrated because the media wouldn't report a story on it.  Finally a week went by and the paper wrote a small story on it.  The article showed a photo of a weather balloon and the paper stated they were merely weather balloons.  But it was too obvious they weren't.;42.5423315789474;-83.2130263157895
