The ship came down from the sky, it was a whitish blue light, the object was cylinder like.  It came across the sky and down and then disappeared.  I looked at my son who is 11 and asked,” did you see that?”  He said very excitedly yes, I saw it too.  We described to each other what we saw and marked the time at 6:00 P.M. exactly.  It did  not have a tail but looked more like a computer cursor.  It headed into the trees, but we saw no explosion like we expected, instead it just disappeared..;42.5423315789474;-83.2130263157895
