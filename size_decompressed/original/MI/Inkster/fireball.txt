As a kid who wanted to be an astronaut, I had to see it for myself. I set my alarm to go watch the comet.   When I got outside I saw a ball of fire passing across the sky and though it was the comet. The size of the object was about the size of a pencil eraser held at an extended arm length away. I watched as it passed by.    The object was not falling but holding a straight course going from east to west at a sustained altitude.   As an 11yr old kid I had no real idea what a comet was other then knowing it flew in space. But it definitely was a Ball of Fire passing at an altitude of roughly 3000 feet high.  It should have been seen going past or over Detroit Metro Airport.
