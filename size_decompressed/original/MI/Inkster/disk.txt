I stood up abruptly, and went outside and looked up at the sky.  The sky was darkening, because the sun was just going down, and I could see a reddish-orange light on a moving black object.   The light looked as if it were fire, so I assumed it was a lantern being released, but then the fiery light went away, and I was left seeing a disk shaped black object.  It was close enough to where I could see the wobble in it, like a saucer that wobbled.  No sound.   I watched it until I couldn't see it anymore, and went into a sharp direction change.;42.294;-83.3146
