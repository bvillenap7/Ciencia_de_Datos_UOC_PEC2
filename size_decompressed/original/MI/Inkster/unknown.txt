High altitude, pulsing object.;2011-07-03 10:45:00;45 seconds;High altitude, pulsing object Traveling from north to south, at very high altitude, I saw an object that appeared to pulse, alternating in color from light to dark.   My first thought was that it was a rotating or tumbling mylar balloon, but the pulsing was far too regular.  Three rapid pulses of white (may have been the sun reflecting rather than an actual light) then a pause, during which the object was dark but still visible, then the pulsing would begin again.  The pulsing was consistant for the duration of the event.   Too high to notice a distinct outline or shape.   Then it stopped for a moment, then continued in the the same north to south direction as before, but slower this time, stopped again, then proceeded east. I know what aircraft look like at ANY altitude, this was NOT an aircraft. (Nor fireworks, or a balloon);42.294;-83.3146
