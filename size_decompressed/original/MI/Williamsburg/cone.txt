STRANGE LIGHTS IN THE SKY, WILLIAMSBURG, MI.;2015-01-22 19:50:00;2 minutes;STRANGE LIGHTS IN THE SKY, WILLIAMSBURG, MI. I was driving East on M72 W in Grand Traverse County, MI, just past a casino with a lot of lights.  I drive this stretch daily/nightly.   I saw on the right hand side/south side of the road, in the sky, three sets of lights. They were all red & green.  One set of lights was off to the left more and the other two sets were closer together, flashing.  I actually couldnt see anything but the lights, so I didn't see a craft.  It didnt appear to be too far into the sky.   As I got closer, trying not to crash & too afraid to pull over,  It seemed that the set of lights closest to me continued to flash & the other two were just green, no red seen at the point of passing it.  The light werent in a straight line.  I was wondering if the craft, if it was, was attracted to the lights of the casino?;44.8067;-85.4329
