On December 27 at approximately 10:40 pm, I was enroute home from snow plowing I noticed an object in the sky.  The object had bright white lights with maybe 1 or 2 small red ones.  I was wathcing the object above the tree line wondering what it could be.  I thought since it was around christmas time it might be some sort of ornament.  As I got closer probably 100 yards out, I slowed my vehicle to a stand still to get a better look. The object was probably the size of a basketball court or a little smaller. Upon stopping I noticed the object hovering(standing still)In no more than 5 seconds it went from a dead stand still to an ubrupt fast sprint forward and after a few seconds began to slow.  I through my truck in reverse and drove backwards somewhat parallel to the object, the horizon grew higher with trees and I eventually lost it.  I figured I would drive out to the main rd, which was higher in elevation to see the thing departing in the distance.  It didnt take any more than 20 seconds to get to the high elevation, and there was nothing to be seen.  It either descended into the woods, or departed very very quick.  The way the thing moved and looked, was nothing similar to any aircraft I have ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  we spoke with this individual, and found him to be a credible witness.
