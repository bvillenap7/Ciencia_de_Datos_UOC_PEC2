Large fireball with long bright tail streaking across southern sky;2002-12-10 18:35:00;5 seconds;Large fireball with long bright tail streaking across southern sky I spotted a large orange/yellow fireball streaking across the southern sky at approximately 6:35pm(EST). It was very bright with a long tail, traveling downward at a slight 10-15 degree angle for 4-5 seconds before breaking/fizzing out. At first glance I thought it was an airplane, but as the tail grew longer and brighter I realized that was not the case.;42.809;-83.7979
