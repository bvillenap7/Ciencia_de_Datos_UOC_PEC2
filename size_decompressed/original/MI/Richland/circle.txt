A group of five people were on the northeast arm of Gull Lake, MI and saw up to fifty orbs of circular light taking off from roughly the Battle Creek area.  These orbs of light flew extremely close together and hovered moving upward and sideways slowly then taking off quickly to the east.  We observed about thirty minutes of activity.;42.3757;-85.4447
I saw a bright reflective circle in the sky (lower than most small aircraft fly).;2015-11-11 17:25:00;~45 seconds;I was riding my horse West of Richland on a big farm looking towards Plainwell.  The sky was clear with no clouds and it was a sunny day.  I saw a bright reflective circle in the sky (lower than most small aircraft fly).   It caught my eye because it didn't look like anything I've seen before and didn't look like a plane.  It was reflective like a mirror without any flickering.   I watched it for around 30 seconds and then reached for my phone to take a picture.  While I was firing up the camera, I watched the object fade like someone used a dimmer switch to turn it off and it was gone from site.  There was nowhere for it to go, no clouds.  But it was gone by the time my camera was ready.;42.3757;-85.4447
