Fire Balls on the 4th of July over Gull Lake in Richland, MI.;2010-07-04 20:00:00;4 hours;Fire Balls on the 4th of July over Gull Lake in Richland MI It was the 4th of July and we were out on Gull Lake on my buddyâ€™s speed boat.  They always have great fireworks out there so we always take the boat to the middle of the lake and watch them. This year the fireworks were not the center of the festivities, shortly after the fireworks started we noticed a strange shimmering red to orange to blue light in the distance.  When it started we just thought they were fireworks or those candle lanterns. It started getting closer the more fireworks went off, it then sped way up and was about a half inch in size in the sky.  At this time it was at the edge of the Lake and would go toward the fireworks as they were being displayed at all edges of the lake from surrounding houses and boats on the lake. The Object then sped out at a great speed till it was gone, after a few min. 3 more showed up from the south side of the lake and 1 from the East side slowing growing in size as they would get close and then moving very quickly in all directions and they look to be flickering like a flame. It resembled a fire ball.  They would then have smaller ones that popped out of the first ones. They too would grow in size and resemble the same as the first. As the fireworks would lull and die down they seemed to get bored of checking out the fireworks and would start to leave and get smaller and smaller off to the distance, as soon as they started up again they all would return.  They would come back this went on for almost 2 to 3 hours.  After the works were all done they would dance with each other over the lake as if they were playing with each other and zip back and forth the lake so fast they left streaks as they moved.  Eventually Very early in the morning hours they all each one would eventually slowly seem to burn out and disappear, until they were all gone.;42.3757;-85.4447
