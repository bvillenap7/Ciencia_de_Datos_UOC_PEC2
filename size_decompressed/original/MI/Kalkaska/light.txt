At 1:30 in the morning on Friday the 21st of September, 2012 my husband woke me to see a light which appeared to be hovering in the distance. This light did not flicker, send down spot light like beams or  move like a helicopter or airplane. There are also no radio towers where it was either. There was simply no way of explaining what in fact it was. It was North West of us. It was in the exact same place for at least an hour and we fell asleep.  Later my husband woke while it was still dark and discovered the light was gone.  We have always been skeptics when it came to this sorta thing at this point we are curious if indeed this was a UFO. There was only one light that we seen as well.  My husband is a disabled 52 year old and I am 42.  We do not use drugs, drink or party.  We are christian people and until now were not convinced that these things were real.;44.7355;-85.1207
