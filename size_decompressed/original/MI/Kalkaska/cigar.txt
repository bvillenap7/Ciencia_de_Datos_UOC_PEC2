Daylight sighting of object passing while I was making my rounds at gas processing plant.;1998-06-15 11:00:00;5 min.;Daylight sighting of object passing while I was making my rounds at gas processing plant. While working alone at a gas processing plant and making my rounds observing all towers and equipment I noticed a cigar shaped object passing on a flight path from south east to north west.The sky was clear blue and the sun was in the position of the time I observed as stated 011:00 hrs.  I imediatly realized that I was seeing a u.f.o. as I had never seen anything like this before in the broad daylight.I stood very still and was a little concerned with the fact that I was all alone and could possibly be abducted.I watched the entire time as it passed hopeing that it might change course or maybe even get a little closer to where I could see it even better.It came to a point where the sun reflected off of it for a moment.Not knowing the true size of this object I could not determine how high or far away it was. I would have to guess that it was at about 5000 to 10000 ft. up.The shape did appear to change at a certain angle as it seemed to go from cigar to football looking.I could not hear any sounds other than the sound of the process area that I was standing in when noticing this object.I called the local sheriff dept. to both report what I had seen and ask if anyone else had called about a sighting, they answered no.This was a unforgetable experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We wonder whether the witness might have witnessed an aircraft, which reflected sunlight off an unpainted fuselage, but we also presume that he probably addressed that possibility at the time of his sighting, and ruled it out.  The witness is correct that it is virtually impossible, without triangulation, to calculate the altitude of an object, whose dimension is unknown.  PD));44.7355;-85.1207
