Bright orange flame, low in sky moving in a NE direction over Charlotte, MI;2007-09-01 21:05:00;3 Minutes;Bright orange flame, low in sky moving in a NE direction over Charlotte, MI I was driving home from the store and happened to look out my drivers window because something caught my attention. Low in the sky was what looked like an orange flame. It was moving slowly in a NE direction. I drove around the block trying to get a better look but by then it had moved almost completely out of sight. Never seen anything like this and have no explanation of what it could be. Freaked me out!;42.5667;-84.8408
A fireball type ufo is seen outside my house frequently and the light dies after a few minutes.;2011-07-10 22:30:00;10 minutes;A fireball type ufo is seen outside my house frequently and the light dies after a few minutes. I started noticing an unblinking orange fireball-like object off in the distance showing no similarities to an airplane.  After a few minutes it would simply disappear.  I know that no pilot would just turn off all external lights this close to night time.  I began checking everynight to try and find it again and i did.  And everytime id look away for a second and it would be gone.  I've only seen this happen twice. After about the third or fourth occurrence, I looked at the southeast part of the sky and something completely different.  It was an unmoving white light, brighter than the moon. It was disk to oval shaped, kind of oblong.  The moon was out on this occasion and it was full so im not sure what i actually saw there, but it wasnt swamp gas or venus.  And once again after a few minutes the light simply went out.  More recently, it was a lot closer than usual and had a kind of hazy spotlight projecting in front of it.  The spotlight was the same color as the ufo itself, bright orange. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.5667;-84.8408
