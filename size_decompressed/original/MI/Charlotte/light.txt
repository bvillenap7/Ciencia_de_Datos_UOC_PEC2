My girlfriend and I have seen a few ufos in nebraska, but, never two in less than a minute. The first was a fast moving ball of white light above us. The next occured just thirty seconds later just to the left of my grandmothers farmhouse. This time it was much larger becuase it was only about fifty yards away. It was a ball of light with a blue glow emminating from it. It moved in a zig zag pattern, then disappeared all in a matter of about two seconds. We felt an overwhelming sense of joy, but the sight of the seconf one almost made my heart jump out of my chest.;42.5667;-84.8408
Several pulsating lights performing impossible maneuvers in the night sky;2012-07-22 02:00:00;1 hour;several pulsating lights performing impossible maneuvers in the night sky the objects were all the same visually looking. they had lights that pulsated like fire light. the first object i encountered was directly over the intersection of wheaton rd and kinsel hwy, about 100 ft in the air. the object moved south about 20 feet at about 30 mph and then it made several 15 ft circles in the sky.  It continued to do these movements with no set pattern. after about an hour the object had very slowly drifted towards the north west. i observed 5 others that had similar lights and moving patterns through out the night in several different locations in the sky. the last one i observed was the exact same as the first (lights, location, movements) and that was at 5:35 am.  i was just outside of the door at the factory on the west side, where there were no lights, no other doors, and in front of me was a field about 60 yards long and then cochran rd (north to south) and then a corn field as far as the eye could see.;42.5667;-84.8408
