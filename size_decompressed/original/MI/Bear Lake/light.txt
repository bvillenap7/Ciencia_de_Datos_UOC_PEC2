Moving Southwest very slowly and vanished.  A few seconds later, another point of light appeared directly above me, moving Northeast at a slow rate.  I immediately thought it was the I.S.S. (having seen the Space Station before, it looked very similar), however  at about 40 degrees, it seemed to stop and change direction moving North.  After continuing for a few moments it changed direction to Northeast again.  I followed the point of light until it finally disappeared behind the treeline.;44.4311;-86.1425
