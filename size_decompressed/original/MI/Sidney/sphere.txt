stars that fly;2004-10-01 23:00:00;4 hours;stars that fly I was looking at the stars one night when they a few decieved me and started moving . They would stay still like a star when cars went bye then move.I can best describe it as like a hallucination,I couldnt believe my eyes.Then it happened again I was smoking a cigarette and i put it out and started flicking my lighter  letting the flame shine in the dark a few seconds at a time when it happened again.This time they got very close and i could here what sounded like a huge metal door open in the woods behind me and bright  lite..since ive seen again in the distance but have been kinda nervous to look at or for.Ive told a couple peole but dont want people to think im nuts..
