Three reddish orbs that moved silently through the sky changing formation twice before vanishing.;2015-09-09 21:20:00;3-5 minutes;Three reddish orbs that moved silently through the sky changing formation twice before vanishing. My wife told me there was something odd going on in the sky over the parking lot for our townhouses.  I came to the window just as three pinkish red orbs rose over the tree tops in the S/SW.   They at first reminded me of helicopters, but I immediately noticed there was no sound what so ever as they moved.  They were spread out in a line, which smoothly reformed into a triangle as they continued to move.  Then they stopped for a moment and made a 90-degree turn and proceeded in the new direction.  They traveled for about a minute, stopped and broke the triangle, and reformed into what reminded me of the configuration of stars in Orion's belt.   As they hovered the object on the right of the formation dwindled in size and brightness till it disappeared.   The other two followed suit within about two minutes.  I had the distinct impression that the diminishment was due to the objects moving away from us, much like a ship on the horizon.;42.17;-83.7819
