3 amber/orange circles in triangle pattern.;2014-08-31 21:30:00;5 minutes;3 amber/orange circles in triangle pattern. Driving westbound on Michigan Ave from Saline there were fireworks going off 15 minutes prior.   Then when reaching Saline And Clinton border, I see 3 amber colored circles in a triangle pattern.  There were not red or flashing similar to airplane lights, but more of a glimmer.   The three amber/orange shapes were in a triangle pattern for several minutes and then formed a straight vertical line.   I was pulled over watching at this point.   They stood in a vertical line for a minute or so and then phased out one by one. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above, to reflect a sighting in 2014.
