It started on 9-13-09 i was driving home from work at 7:30 heading south when an orenge light of to the east caught my eye i watched it;2009-09-13 19:30:00;10 seconds;It started on 9-13-09 i was driving home from work at 7:30 heading south when an orenge light of to the east caught my eye i watched it for more that 20 seconds trying to figure out what it was when it dimmed down and disappeard.  I though about it that night trying to think of what it could have been it wasnt a plane i know that. then tonight 9-14-09 at 8:30 i just looked out the second floor window and there it was again so i stopped watched it for ten seconds and it dimmed down just like it had the day before and was gone.;42.17;-83.7819
