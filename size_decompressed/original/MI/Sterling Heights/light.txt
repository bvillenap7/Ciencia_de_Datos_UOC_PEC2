The object moved faster, lower and the lights were brighter than an airplane.;2004-02-13 03:00:00;3/5 min.;The object moved faster, lower and the lights were brighter than an airplane. From my kitchen window, facing east, a bright flashing light caught my eye at about the roof top of my next door neighbors home. When I looked back to see it, it had disappeared. It was moving in a northerly direction, I thought I saw three bright lights one being brighter in a straight pattern. The object moved in a straight path, the lights never dimming, and quite low in the sky visible through the trees. I felt the object moved much faster and lower than an airplane. The lights were always white, bright and blinking. The object never stopped and I watched it until it was out of sight.;42.5850180124223;-83.0243329192547
Stars/lights moving then stopping then turning right angles all night;2007-07-21 03:45:00;two hours;Stars/lights moving then stopping then turning right angles all night Last night i was on the phone with a friend and looking in the sky as i always do but this time was different because i spent a long time starring at the sky.I saw sum shooting stars in the sky and and sum planes but i couldn't believe it when i observed a star moving.I thought ok its got to be a plane up high.After it moved out of sight i continued to look up about a few minutes later and saw sum more stars moving.i then observed the light speed up then slow down.It freaked me out a little.by that time i was off the phone texting my girl friend back and forth.the star moved out of range so i watched the sky sum more and seen another star move east to west and it looked like it made a s maneuver and then keep going then slowed down again.It went away and i just kept seeing these lights in the sky and i said to my self no plane can do that. I then saw another light in the east sky going north make a right turn instantly.It was just weird.by this time it was around 5 a.m. and my friend calls me up he lives couple blocks away and him and his friend came over.I got in his car for about ten minutes and listen to sum songs he recorded and told him about what i saw and of course he brushed it off like i was playing.Then we got out the car and i looked up and saw another light it was dim and i said look.It was going south then it made a quick flash then kept going and made another flash. after that we went into my house to record a song.That could of been a meteor but i was seeing strange lighs all night move through the sky, weird.I would say over two hours of watching the sky i seen about nine lights i couldn't explain.;42.5850180124223;-83.0243329192547
Bright light to tiny red light to nothing.;2008-04-29 23:00:00;30 seconds;Bright light to tiny red light to nothing. My boyfriend and I were driving back to my house (cutting through the neighborhood) when we both noticed a bright light in the sky. It was around 11:05 PM with a clear sky. When we noticed the light, we stopped for a second to look at it, thinking that it was coming from a plane.  After a few seconds, the light started to fade away, almost as if it were moving back. The big bright light dimmed into a tiny red light, then within seconds, it completely disappeared. We drove out of the neighborhood to get onto the main rood (which had a better view) to see if we noticed any thing out of the norm.  There was absolutely nothing in the sky but a few stars in the distance.;42.5850180124223;-83.0243329192547
Strange light moves steadily, stops, restarts, and then violently zig-zags and dissappears.;2008-05-25 21:08:00;4 Minutes;Strange light moves steadily, stops, restarts, and then violently zig-zags and dissappears. I observed a light in the southern sky when traveling south on M-53. It moved steadily west and then suddenly stopped, then it continued west before zig zagging violently and disappearing. I live near Selfridge ANG Base and have never seen a plane manuever like that, furthermore the light had a strange glow to it and seemed to be hovering, i.e. changing elevation. If I had to estimate I would say the light was a few miles south of my location, which was at the intersection of M-53 and M-59.;42.5850180124223;-83.0243329192547

The first line looked like it was moving east, then another flash was seen further north.;42.5850180124223;-83.0243329192547
Home and Yard Lit up By Solid White Light, Surrounded By Colored Lights  500 Lights On Object0: Yes;2009-01-23 01:30:00;35 seconds;Home and Yard Lit up By Solid White Light, Surrounded By Colored Lights    I'm visiting my parents in Michigan, and at 1:30 AM my dog wanted to go outside very badly.  She started barking incessantly after a few minutes.  When I went to let her back in I saw that the home behind (and 4 doors down from) my parents home was encased in a bright white light.  The light was very strange in that I could not identify the source.  However, it reminded me of looking at a football field lit up for a night game -- the light is directed squarely on the field but darkness surrounds the field.  This is how the light behaved that shined on the house (and only that house and it's yard).  The light was much whiter and much brighter than what would be achieved by floodlights.  Furthermore, a band of relatively large colored balls of light surrounded the home itself.  To borrow from another analogy, it looked like a band of Christmas lights surrounding the home.  However, these lights were much, much larger than Christmas lights (about the size of a fist at arms distance).  The colored lights were bobbing up and down slightly.  I remember seeing red, blue, and possibly green lights.  No yellow color.  There was no sound other than my dog incessantly barking directly at this home.  The sighting lasted about 35 seconds (from the time I saw the white light), and suddenly the white light 'turned off'.  The colored lights remained around the home.  Therefore, the white light was 35 seconds in duration (but I caught it after it was first present), and the colored lights lasted much longer.  It was very late, and very cold in Michigan, and I therefore did not go outside to investigate further after the white light 'turned off'.  I am making this report because the light, in my opinion, were absolutely not floodlights or 'party' lights, and the source of the white light was far above the house & yard (but I did not see a 'craft').;42.5850180124223;-83.0243329192547
a bright light decending straight down;2011-11-01 23:00:00;2 seconds;a bright light decending straight down Me and my girlfriend were driving back to her place around 11:30PM,  we were about to get on the van dyke express way when we saw a quick moving light.  The light was about as big and bright as jupiter is in the night sky this time of year.   It appeared high in the sky for a second or less then quickly decended straight down untill we lost sight of it in the trees.  This lasted no more then 3 Seconds.    The best way i can describe what we saw would be a light the size and brightness of jupiter travling at termenal velocity.;42.5850180124223;-83.0243329192547
2 orange objects over sterling hts, mi;2012-05-27 22:10:00;3 to 5 mins;2 orange objects over sterling hts , mi 5 -27-12 at about 10:10 PM sun down sky was just beginning to get dark. Two witnesses spotted two orange lights to the south of my location. From my position they seemed to be just over the houses I think they may have been a half mile or more away one higher than the other.  At first they seemed to be either slowly moving toward my location or slowly climbing up. They seemed to float there for a short time Thought at first they could be balloons with flares attached.  The higher one would begin to go higher and the lower one would follow. they began to climb faster the highest one went straight up accelerating out of sight the lower one followed but continued to climb in a northerly direction leaving a faint vapor trail I did not lose sight of the second one until it was overhead and to the north seemed to be at a very high altitude by this time and moving at a very hi rate of speed did not hear any sound.;42.5850180124223;-83.0243329192547
Observed two plasma like orbs of difused light moving East to west at afast clip and low altitude.;2013-08-15 21:45:00;50 seconds;Observed two plasma like orbs of difused light moving East to west at afast clip and low altitude. Observed two lights in eastern sky with a dull yellow color in distance at around 3,000 feet.  Both lights were moving west and one light passed overhead and to my left at around 300 feet.  The light was round and difused.  The size looked to be about 3 feet diameter.  Looked as if  object could have been a plasma ball of light.  As I was driving in a car going east on 16 mile road I could not track objects any further.  Sky conditions were clear.  Did not observe any structure of a craft just a ball of difused light.;42.5850180124223;-83.0243329192547
Bright blue/teal light jumping and diving in Sterling Heights;2017-07-09 00:00:00;5-10 minutes;Bright blue/teal light jumping and diving in Sterling Heights Around 10:00 PM on July 9, 2017 as I was about to unload my groceries, I noticed a bright blue/teal light and a smaller red light in the sky.   At first, I assumed it was a plane but noticed that the lights were not blinking or moving.  After about a minute or less the red light disappeared.   At this time, I called my husband over to come check it out but he blew me off.  After about another minute or so of the bright blue/teal light just stationary, it quickly shot straight up a few feet and stopped.  I again yelled for my husband to come see it, explaining that the red light disappeared and the blue light just shot up quickly.   As my husband walked over to see, the blue light jumped quickly to the left a few feet and then about 15-20 seconds later it dropped or shot or dove down towards the ground in a diagonal direction.  As it dove towards the ground, there was a buzz or zip sound, and then the it was gone, just vanished.;42.5850180124223;-83.0243329192547
I noticed one satilte that  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-05-03 22:08:00;Five minutes;As I was outside of my VFW hall I was looking up as I normally do to see the stars that are locally visible I noticed one satilte that I often see but this was way different.  As usual I follow satilte trails and watch them dim as they pass.  But on my honor and reputation I have never see 14 in a row traveling on the same path. I am an avid star gazer and I know the ISS travels and have seen satilte trajectory but never like this with no noise.;42.5850180124223;-83.0243329192547
