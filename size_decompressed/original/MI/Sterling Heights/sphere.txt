My husband left the house this evening to pick up my oldest son and ran back in to tell me to come and see something in the sky. I ran to the middle of the street and he pointed over the houses across the street and I saw four orange orbs in a square pattern moving across the sky in close proximity to each other. I immediately called my neighbors to come out and see. By the time they came out (maybe 1/2 min) ...one of the orbs faded out and was gone. One by one the last 3 dissapeared. After they were gone a 5th orb came into view and seemed a bit more intense and then faded away.;42.5850180124223;-83.0243329192547
