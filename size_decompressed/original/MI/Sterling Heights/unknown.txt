Red light moving and changing colors as it rotated over Sterling Heights, Michigan.;2014-04-13 00:24:00;1 minute;Red light moving and changing colors as it rotated over Sterling Heights, Michigan. Witnesses were in car, one as driver and one in backseat.  The driver noticed it first and requested attention of passenger.   There was a stationary object in the air with multiple red lights across its surface (in a line).  The object was still for about twenty to thirty seconds.   Among the red lights there appeared to be one white light that blinking across the red lights when all of the sudden it drastically changed its course and headed north leaving a white trail of light (comet like) across the sky.   The object appeared to be rotating and colors changed from orange to white.   It began to fade from view while moving north and occasionally for two to three seconds after would faintly appear before completely disappearing from view.   Total witness time was about one minute.
