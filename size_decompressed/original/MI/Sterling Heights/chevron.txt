I was driving home from work on Friday, October 21, at 11:21 PM.  I turned down the side-street to get to our driveway and saw a chevron/boat-shaped craft descending at an approximate 30 degree angle to below the nearby treeline.  The craft was fairly small and had a stainless steel-like appearance.   I could detect any sound and it could not have been more than 200 yards away, as the treeline is only a few streets over from us.   I did not see any more of the craft once it was below the treeline.. ((NUFORC Note:  Correct time is 2322 hrs..
