Many flashing objects moving in an oval pattern at high speeds.;2007-12-19 20:00:00;About 10-15 Minutes;Many flashing objects moving in an oval pattern at high speeds. It was about 8:00 pm when my neighbor called me on the phone. He explained that there were light in the sky, I rushed upstairs and ran outside. The objects were faint, there were approximately ten to twenty objects moving in a circular motion. The objects flashed very slowly, the traveled at an extremely fast rate, like nothing I have ever seen. I didn’t notice any clouds or smoke, but at times some of the objects had a trail behind them.  The objects danced around the sky for about ten to fifteen minutes. There was no aircraft or power lines in the vicinity. Nothing that would create a pattern like this. There wasn’t anything between the objects, and me but there were light clouds. I was wearing my glasses at the time, which had been recently cleaned, I tried viewing the objects with and without the glasses, and I saw the same objects. I wasn’t wearing any headphones at the time, the objects were silent. I’m not on any prescription drugs, nor was I consuming alcohol. The sighting concluded around 8:10 or 8:15.
