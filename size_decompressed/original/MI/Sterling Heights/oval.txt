Southeast Michigan,  orange light, grew  held still and then vanished with little trace.;2000-10-02 09:54:00;6-8 seconds;Southeast Michigan,  orange light, grew  held still and then vanished with little trace. Object had medium-dark orange light that didnt seem to shine far.  Southwest to where I was in  a large, very large light illuminated. The shaped seemed to swell or enlarge in equal proportions-then the light stopped completely.Next the craft appeared to go very dim and looked very distant. Like a distant star. Then as we watched it just faded into nothing, as if moving farther away. For a split second I thought it was a shooting star that wasnt burning out, but then i realized it couldnt be because it didnt move.  Then i thought it was a firework or a wise guy shot a flare, but then as it grew you could see an object inside it. By the way it dissapated it wasnt anything that was ignited.  Certainly was not helicopter, plane, or jet.  They just cant and dont move like that.;42.5850180124223;-83.0243329192547
A black unknown craft is seen in the sky over Sterling Hts. Michigan;2012-10-10 19:09:00;1-2 minutes;A black unknown craft is seen in the sky over Sterling Hts. Michigan I am a security guard and while driving South on Schoenherr towards 14 mile rd. in Stering Hts. Michigan on Wed. 10/10/12 at 7:09pm I saw a craft in the sky that I couldn't identify.  The shape of the craft was hard to identify because it had 2 bright white lights on the front of it.  The best description I can give is a black oval or rectangular shaped craft (20'x10') with 2 bright white lights on the front of it like headlights on a car.  The craft was moving to slow to be a plane almost like it was hovering, but it was too high to be a helicopter.  I pulled over into the center turn lane just South of Moravian and took a picture of the craft.  After I took a picture of the craft using my cell phone (HTC EVO), I switched my phone over to video mode then began to record it as it moved through the sky now with no lights on/visible.  After recording it for approx. 16 seconds I switched my phone back to picture mode and when I went to take another picture the ! craft was gone.  Even though I was still in the turn lane, I got out of my truck and looked everywhere for the craft but it was gone.  I got back into my truck and called the UFO Hotline to report the sighting as I drove to the place where I was headed to before the sighting.;42.5850180124223;-83.0243329192547
White oval meandering sky at noon;2019-06-30 12:00:00;5 minutes;White oval meandering sky at noon I was walking a dog near Lakeside Mall right around noon.  I heard a helicopter and looked up.  The helicopter traveled normally out of my line of vision, but I noticed a bright white oval or circle very very very high in the sky (much higher than the helicopter had been if an airplane had been at this altitude it would have looked tiny or almost indistinct). It was moving unlike anything from nature or a human made craft.  It moved slowly in an organic curving pattern, sort of meandering back and forth, toward the sun then away.  It almost looked like a paper plate blowing in the wind, however it seemed way too high to be an object from Earth and the distance it was traveling in each motion was fairly long â€” way too far for an object to be blown back and forth I think.  It would also pause and stay still for periods. I watched it for at least five minutes. There also appeared to be many swirling white dots around the sun, moving like those fireworks that snake around willy nilly after they launch.  It did not occur to me until later that day that I should not have been able to look at the sun in the way that I must have been to see the swirling lights, but the sun did not hurt my eyes until I tried to look back and take video. While I was taking the video it disappeared. The short clip shows the object floating in the sky. The longer clip shows, at the end, an object with two lights appearing and dropping straight down suddenly and disappearing.  I did not see this with my eyes because the sun was too bright, but it is clear around :07-08 in the lower left of the sky shown if you zoom in on that region.;42.5850180124223;-83.0243329192547
