Saw five fireball objects flying at a low altitude and steady speed crossing from west toward the northeast.;1999-11-16 19:00:00;12 seconds;Saw five fireball objects flying at a low altitude and steady speed crossing from west toward the northeast. I was outside with a police officer and we happened to be looking at the sky over Sterling Heights, a large suburb of Detroit.  At approximately 1900 hours, we witnessed five medium-sized orange fireballs with long tails that sparkled at the ends.  There was a quiet burning sound associated with them, but they were definately not jets or any other type of airplane.  They were all moving at the same speed at an even pace, all equidistant, flying from the west to the northeast.  As they were going toward the northeast, they winked out like a dimmer-switch being turned all the way down.  The police officer checked with her dispatch and the 911 center was lit up with phone calls from all over the city.  One woman apparently described what she saw as a Chinese dragon, the orange lights moving as a Chinese dragon in a parade.;42.5850180124223;-83.0243329192547
Object traveling from west to east, Very Large white/blue fireball with long yellow orange tail 4 smaller objects behind it.;1999-11-16 19:06:00;1.5 min;Object traveling from west to east, Very Large white/blue fireball with long yellow orange tail 4 smaller objects behind it. Boy this thing was Huge! I've never seen anything like it. Was traveling west on 17 mile Rd. when this fireball caught my eye to the left of me (south) at a very low altitude just below the moon, skies were very clear.I thought at first it was a plane on fire and breaking up. Color was a bright white/blue and was emitting smaller but very bright round objects along its trailing yellow orange tail which was 1/2 mile in length, there was no sound. I continued to watch the object approx. 1.5 min until it disappeared in the eastern horizon.;42.5850180124223;-83.0243329192547
3 large orange fireballs in a triangular formation just south of Lakeside Mall;2011-09-11 23:10:00;3 minutes;3 large orange fireballs in a triangular formation just south of Lakeside Mall On that Sunday evening aprox. around 11:10pm I was getting ready to lock up the front door of my first floor apartment to get ready for bed when I noticed a bright light just coming over the tree tops.   I yelled for my sister who was living with me at the time to come take a look.  We both stepped outside and watched to our amazement 3 large  orange fireballs in a triangular formation, but didn’t seemed attached to each other since one lagged behind for a moment then caught up with the formation again and continued heading southeast over Hayes Ave going toward 19 Mile Rd  while slowly rising up toward the clouds then seem to disappear in the clouds. The whole event seemed to take about 3-5 minutes.   My sister and I are in our late forty’s and were not under the influence of any kind. I called the Sterling Heights Police dept. the next day to ask if they got any calls about the night before and they said “no”, that it was probably a weather balloon from Selfridge Air Base that’s located about 10 mile east of us.  We both disagree because we saw it coming from the north and it was just over the tree tops slowly moving upward.;42.5850180124223;-83.0243329192547
