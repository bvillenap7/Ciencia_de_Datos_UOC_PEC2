I saw solid red and green lights, with a dominant very bright pulsating red light forming a triangle shape.  This red light slowly pulsed (faded in and out) 3 times, then paused, then 3 times again, over and over.  It abruptly changed course twice, I estimate about 60 to 80 degree course change each time.  I was in my car stopped at a stop sign, and I rolled my window down but I could not hear any helicopter or plane noises.  It simply floated out of my view over the horizon.  It moved roughly at the same speed a traffic helicopter might move.;42.5850180124223;-83.0243329192547
