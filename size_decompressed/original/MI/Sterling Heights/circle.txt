a black circle hoverring over an airplain for 4-5 second;2007-09-21 13:00:00;4-5 seconds;a black circle hoverring over an airplain for 4-5 second On the last two weekends of the month  of sep. Saturday or Sunday  the event happened  so it was  either the 20th , 21st or the 27th ,28th  . I was sitting outside, in the garage enjoying the mild temperatures around 60 degrees .  It was a clear day with vary few mist of clouds . I was watching airplanes flying over  with vary high altitude where the plane makes a straight trace of clouds. There was lots of planes going passed , which is normal in this area because the airport is about 40miles away. One of the air planes happened to go through a mist of cloud ,[very light cloud].suddenly  a black circle object appeared above the  airplane and moved forward in my direction . Ware the airplane was moving from east to west . I was facing  south .  When the object  appeared  over the plane , moved forward about 3inches  and stopped  a second or two not moving  then  moved back south again slightly to west  and disappeared .  This happened while I was watching the kids playing outside and my 11 year old daughter sitting to my left and watching same plane at the same time. I asked my daughter “what is that” I did not tell her what I saw because I want to see if she saw the same thing and she answered “ yes what is that” ,she described it as the same thing I saw .
