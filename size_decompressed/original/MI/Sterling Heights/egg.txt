I had been just looking through beyond the balcony, sliding glass door, while in the living room of the apartment, and I noticed an egg-shaped, probably flat, silver object.  It had black trim on the top and the bottom, and it appeared to have a round black area in the center of it.  It moved in a direction from north to south.  It was probably no larger than 5 feet from top to bottom.  It moved steadily in a perfect horizontal line without going up or down.  It made no noise.  It must have hovered flown no higher than 25 feet above the ground.  After it passed the line of sight of my balcony window, I then noticed that five wild geese flew down from the opposite direction to the grassy area across from the parking lot below the apartment.
