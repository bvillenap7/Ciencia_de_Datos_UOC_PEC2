My now husband and I were traveling mid day in light traffic going west on M10 after exiting off of I75 we had been traveling about 15-20 mins on M10 and were in the slow lane going through farm fields when we saw one flat mat color, not shiny metal sphere, about the size of a dodge ball that had groves or fins fall right in front of our van about a car length away. We thought we were going to hit the sphere but realized it didn’t hit the ground and then spun forward and shot straight up and was gone.  No lights, no trail, no sounds, no smells no other aircrafts in the sky.  I believe it’s something military but who knows;43.6124;-84.111
