Triangle shaped with 3 bright white lights and one red on I-75 through Auburn;2007-11-05 23:00:00;1 minute;Triangle shaped with 3 bright white lights and one red on I-75 through Auburn. Last night (11-5-07 ) I had my closest ecounter yet!  On I-75 at midnight pasing thru Auburn, there was an object on the right side of the highway so bright it looked like someone had thier brights on in the sky...except there were about three white lights. As I got closer there was a red light too. I got RIGHT up to it and saw it was a triangle shape and didn't move just above wooded area.  Then I actually saw a light blue beam go down into the woods from it, then it slowly disapeared over the trees.  A car was pulled over with his hazards on and I believe they were watching it as well. It was fantastic!!!!!!!!;43.6124;-84.111
