Sitting out in the back yard and saw a red glowing light, that, at first, I thought was a burning star - bright red. I was going to run in and grab my camera but thought by the time I got back it would be gone…so I continued to watch as it started getting closer.  It seemed like it was right over my house.  I ran in to get my camera and came back out. It was still close enough to get a good picture but when I turned my camera on, the battery light was flashing. After about a minute, the red strobe had ascended to a barely visible sight, and, I'd say, within a minute, the red “strobe” had ascended to a barely visible sight, and, I’d say, within a minute, the red strobe was gone.  I did manage to get my dying camera to snap a shot but all you can see is a red dot.  My friend snapped one on a camera phone, however, all you can see is a blob and a bright white line at the bottom of the frame. What is the bright light? We tried to reproduce it to no avail. It appeared to have a bottom, winged or firey top, and appeared closer than maybe it was (??).  Bright red, as if it were on fire or moving…like maybe there was a red firey gas in there.
