Red/orange retagular shaped light in Northwestern sky;2007-06-30 22:30:00;15-30 seconds;Red/orange retagular shaped light in Northwestern sky It was approx 10:30 at night.   My 13 year old daughter and I were enjoying a bonfire and I had gone into the house for a moment to check on my younger son.   As I opened my slider to walk onto the deck I saw a bright redish-orange oblong or rectangular object in the North Western sky.  I asked my daughter to come up on the deck and she saw it too.  It was much lower in the sky than Venus and there was a full moon that night.  We watched the object move from left to right, and then the object was stationary for about 10-15 seconds.  There were no blinking lights, and no sounds so I was certain it was not a plane.  After about 10 seconds of it hovering, the object appeared to be getting smaller and appeared to go away from us until it was just a red speck in the sky.;43.0039999999999;-84.5693000000001
