13 lights north east bound over Clinton County.;2014-08-13 21:00:00;5 minutes;13 lights north east bound over clinton county around august 13 i had seen what i would describe as a formation in the sky.  it was flying south east to north west, on a path that i almost every day see military helicoptors and even A-10 fighters fly.  The formation made almost no sound.  on the left-hand side (as i looked up) i counted around 13 lights.  flying right next to that craft to my right hand side was what appeared to be a regular run of the mill airplane.  I watched them fly directly over head and i was very shocked that i had not heard anyone else talk about it. It must have been around 2100 hours because it was dark... the craft were flying rather low, i couldn't even really estimate a 'normal' height for a commercial airplane.  I got the impression that the craft was being escorted and that maybe it was air force 1.  As stated above i often see military craft fly that same route back and forth daily, but I know of no airbase in the direction they fly that is in America.
