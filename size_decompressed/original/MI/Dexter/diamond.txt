My husband was driving home from work at about 9:30 am and he told me to go look outside towords Dexter.  It's a clear day with not one cloud in the sky, except for some chem trails off in the distance.   We saw this black shiny, what looked like an ice cream cone, object with lights and the top half looked like it was rotating.  It looked like the object was moving closer and getting bigger, then far away, it was getting smaller.  Then it looked like it was starting to land, maybe towords Chelsea.  I lost it behind the trees and wasn't able to see it again.  I made sure to show my brother-in-law, his girlfriend, my friend from next door and my father-in-law.  You could probably see it from I-94 heading west out of Ann Arbor. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.3583;-83.8966
