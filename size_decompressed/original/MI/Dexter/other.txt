There were other aircraft in the area, but they appeared much smaller and farther away.  The speed seemed moderate -  steady and smooth. The first one moved across the horizon and then out of sight followed by the next one and then a third and finally a fourth.  (about 10 minutes entire duration) *The last one reversed directions and returned east and then northeast, until it disappeared.  *it did not turn like an airplane, both turns were instantaneous and there was absolutely NO SOUND! The most profound thing about this incident was that none of the objects made any sound!!  We live in a rural area and can hear aircraft from miles away. We will mail a diagram of the lights we saw, including in the drawing the horizon and a moon for better idea of we witnessed. We were unable to find anyone else that also witnessed these crafts.;42.3583;-83.8966
