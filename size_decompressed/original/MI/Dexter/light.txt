Followed by a bright light;2012-02-06 19:00:00;35 minutes;Followed by a brigh light I am not crazy or paranoid.  This incident really freaked me out. I was walking through our neighborhood about 7:30 in the evening.  The sky was clear with lots of stars are airplanes flying.  I noticed a bright single light in the western sky not far outside our subdivision.  The light first appeared to not move like a satellite.  It was obvious the light was not a star.  I started to notice it moved in the direction I was walking.  I would walk down the hill and it moved with me as Iâ€™d come back around the loop toward the top of the hill it would be at that point and then move with me again down the hill.  Then (really freaky) when I walked up our driveway it came toward the house like it was getting a closer look at where I lived.;42.3583;-83.8966
