It caught my attention because it was too big to be a plane, and was brighter than summer Jupiter.  I watched it pulse for a while when I noticed two smaller blinking red lights.  It stayed hovering over my garage for a few minutes, then suddenly took off over my house and into the distance.  When it flew over my house, it made a sound similar to a low-flying plane, but it was very much not a plane.;42.3583;-83.8966
