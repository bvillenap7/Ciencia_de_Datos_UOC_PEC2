Orange craft manuvering very strangely of Alpena, Michigan, on July 4, 2009.;2009-07-04 23:30:00;2 min.;Orange craft manuvering very strangely of Alpena, Michigan, on July 4, 2009 On July 4th, 2009, approximately a hour or two after the fireworks, five of us gathered on our back deck to continue the July 4th celebration with our own set of displays.  It was about midnight (Eastern Time).   While looking Northward are attention soon became focused on a bright orange light which did travel very fast, stop in mid-air, did a u-turn, and zoom in and out of the atmosphere at incredible speeds.  It was like nothing I had ever seen before.   It made me fearful and curious at the same time, yet I kept my composure due to my daughter and her young friend getting scared.   The object could have been located anywhere from 5-10 miles out at times and much, much further at times,  It would be hard for me to tell or approximate a distance. The next day while talking about it, my other daughter, who was not present on our back deck, said that while at a friends house a few blocks away on the same night also witnessed this event.   In addition, we did video record this occurrence.  This is my true testimonial as I know it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness forwards video, taken with cell phone camera, of object.  Footage is very choppy, but shows a prominent, bright object, against a dark sky.  PD));45.0767000000001;-83.4556000000005
