Fluorescent Green Triangle shaped object, appeared to be landing in woods...;1990-12-04 23:15:00;1-2 minutes;Fluorescent Green Triangle shaped object, appeared to be landing in woods... Coming home from work on the corner of Schearer Rd. and Hope Rd. observed a Very large fluorescent green triangle shaped craft ( the size of a football field or bigger.). It should be noted that the craft was totally dark except for the  fluorescent, bright green outline of the triangle. The craft was making no sound or forward movement,actually upended so triangle shape could be clearly seen, and slowly appeared to be landing into the nearby woods. It should be noted that at this time there was no snow on the roads or in the fields.... At the time I was 33 years old,just headed home from work, nothing other then the craft was out of the ordinary, it was just a normal night coming home. After the craft had appeared to have landed I started to drive down Schearer Rd. towards Wendt Rd. Wendt Rd. was the nearest road to where the craft appeared to have landed, however at the time Wendt Rd. was only a small dirt seasonal road and common sense and a bit of fear ! told me not to proceed. At this moment I turned around and headed back towards my home about 3 to 5 minuets away.;43.7869;-84.3263
