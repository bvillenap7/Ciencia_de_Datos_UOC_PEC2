About 530 am I saw what looked like a star low in the sky, and brighter than the rest.  it was flickering between a few different colors. blue red and yellow. the flickering light was far away but was and still is slowly moving on and off.  It moved down and to the left and then back up, and then to the right. and then back to where it was and a airplane passed below the object and it stopped flickering and became still.  the object started moving again. an aircraft passed over the object and it did the same, but it was moving in between the passing of both airplanes. it is still in the sky and it is six eleven in the morning.  I am too tired to watch this but i have never seen anything like it before and i thought it was worth reporting.  the object kept acting like it wanted to move upward but it was also avoiding the exhaust from the airplanes.  I hope this helps somehow.  I am curious to what it was but i know that i have never seen anything like this be! fore and i look at the night sky on a regular basis. another interesting thing was that the treeline below seemed to light up on and off slower than lightning but close. but only as i was looking at the object. if i were to look at the tree line i would see nothing.;42.5173;-85.4074
