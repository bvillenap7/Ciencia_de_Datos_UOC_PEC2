Right next to one of the towers was what I thought to be and airplane. But then I noticed that It was shaped like a sphere and it could manuver at an unbeliveable rate! First it decended then it went back up again. Then I saw the flashes. Bright red,blue, and green light up the ske like fireworks then it vanished!
