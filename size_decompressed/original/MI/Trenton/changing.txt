Changed from disk to triangle, broke up, never went over horizon, flying away from a nuclear power plant.;2008-07-17 19:30:00;5 min.;Changed from disk to triangle, broke up, never went over horizon, flying away from a nuclear power plant. My friend and I were playing a game of bolo in his front yard, as we were putting everything away, this huge silent craft flew just less the 100 feet right, and about 200 feet above when closest to us.  The craft at fist had a ring of lights that went around it in a counter-clockwise pattern, starting with a bright white light and getting dimmer behind it for about 5 lights. The ring was made up of approximately 12 lights. When the craft had gone about a quarter mile past us, it had changed into a triangle shaped craft and went on in a strait line not curving over the horizon. The triangle consisted of 5 lights with a blinking red light in the center. It went behind a tree and we backed up to see and it was still continuing in a strait line. Then, it had disappeared for about 5 seconds the lights flashed brightly and split up, flew in slightly different directions, but all commonly exited the atmosphere and went out of sight. It the entire time had never curved down with the earth over the horizon, just gone strait out of the atmosphere. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
