When I was leaving my car to walk into my house, I decided to look up at the night sky.  I then noticed an almost completely black figure shaped like a rectangle flying at about the same altitude as a normal airplane would, but I noticed it was traveling about 2 or 3 times faster than a normal airplane.  I don't know how I caught it, but it was very hard to see.  I know what I saw though.  A Rectangular craft. I've never seen anything like it.  Maybe a secret government plane?  It was just weird.  Cool, but weird.  Is this a common sighting?  I've seen UFOs many times before, but nothing like this;42.1382;-83.2179000000001
