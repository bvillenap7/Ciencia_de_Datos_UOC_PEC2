Two bright fireballs stop and go, moving at differing speeds and towards different areas.  ((anonymous report));2016-05-09 23:15:00;5 minutes;Two bright fireballs stop and go, moving at differing speeds and towards different areas There were two very bright orange fireballs that started off very close together and then slowly came apart.  They both decreased and increased in brightness every thirty seconds or so.   I believed them to be bright planes at first until they just stopped moving for a while, then one took off to the south and the other slowly moved east before circling back around to travel back south after the other one.
