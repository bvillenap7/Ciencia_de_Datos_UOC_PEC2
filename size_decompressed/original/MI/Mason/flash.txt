They were so bright that they lit up my living room.   I decided to see if anyone else had seen them, so I scoured my social media sites, and sure enough, multiple people saw it.   It was not stormy and it faded away instead of flashing away. It only lasted about 10-20 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
