a large, very fast moving white sphere appears to land/crash just southeast of Mason, Michigan;2005-11-05 01:00:00;2 seconds;a large, very fast moving white sphere appears to land/crash just southeast of Mason, Michigan I was alone in my car with the radio/stereo off, traveling south on Cedar, just north of Mason, Michigan at 1:00 am.  There were no other vehicles in my sight---either ahead or behind me.  I had just done an illegal U-turn, as I had started heading in the wrong direction on a one way divided highway.  It was a clear night: the stars were very visible.  At the top of my windshield I immediately noticed a VERY bright--brighter than any stars or planets--spherical or possibly oval shaped white light heading towards the southeast at a VERY steep angle.  It was such a steep angle, and it was moving SO fast that I thought at first it must be a HUGE meteorite (it looked like the size of a small house)--and it was going to crash.  I awaited the inevitable flash of light (assuming there would be a flash), but there was only silence.  There had been no noise before it hit/landed either. Also, there was no tail (or trail) attached like a meteor would exhibit. I have seen dozens of meteorites during my lifetime---either in meteor storms or other times---and this was NOTHING like that.  This was, in fact, like nothing I have EVER witnessed before.  This object was incredibly bright---much brighter than any meteor I have ever seen---and moved VERY fast. It was much slower than a shooting star (meteorite), but much, much faster than anything else I have ever seen in my life.  It was not a plane or a jet or a helicopter. The object moved from my view at the top of my windshield to the ground in less than 3 seconds. No man-made vehicle can move that fast. And yet, I know it was not a meteor. (At the very least I am extremely certain it was not.);42.5784;-84.4551
