3 objects seen by 2 Harper Woods, Mi. Police Officers.;2020-07-06 06:00:00;5 minutes;3 objects seen by 2 Harper Woods, Mi. Police Officers. I am a Police Officer for the city of Harper Woods.  At approximately 6:00am, myself and a fellow officer were standing in a parking lot of a church talking before the end of our shift.  I was looking towards the southwest at the moon when I glanced towards the southeast.  I saw 3 objects in the southeast sky and pointed towards them.  My co-worker noticed them at that point and attempted to take a picture with his cell phone.  He was unable to see the objects with his phone camera, but I was with mine, and took a picture of two of the objects.  The objects appeared to remain stationary for approximately 3 minutes, the appeared to drift towards the east, maintaining the equal distance.  As we watched the objects, they appeared to blink out of our vision. *Note* the night/morning was cloudless.;42.4435;-82.9328
