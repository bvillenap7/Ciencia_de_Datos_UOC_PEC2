It was the forth of July, we lived in a town house...my husband had a little bit of fireworks to shoot off, so I took my three little ones to watch out a 2nd floor bedroom window...when my husband was done, he went to clean up and I started putting our children in their beds...as I did so, my husband started yelling for me to come to the window, I rushed over to see what he was looking at....he was pointing up and as I leaned my head against the screen, I could see something hughe going over us, heading north east....I only saw the tail end, it was going very slow, as my husband was yelling, it's looks like Star Wars....it was big and super low....I turned to race out of my place, ran down the stair and went out our front door, that was on the east side of the building.  But as I got out I should of seen it, but no, I saw nothing....I ran around the building to my husband and he was all excited...asking me if I saw it...we walked back into our unit, but when! we walked in, it was no longer 10pm, it was now 12:30am, Johnny Carson was going off, on our TV, and by no way did I stay outside that long...I turned the TV off and the lights and went to bed....the next morning, Dave was reading the news paper, as I cleaning up from breakfast, my friend, knocks on our door...I opened it and she asked if we saw that big UFO that went over out complex last night...I saw I only saw a little bit, but Dave saw it....my friend said it went over our complex, just missing the trees, that it took over an hour to go over us...she said that she watched with her daughter, sitting on their front steps....my friend comes in and I said to my husband, that our friend saw it too, he questioned what, I said that UFO you watched go over our place (our friend lived east of us, in the back part of our townhouses....my husband called me nuts, that he didn't see nothing like that, he didn't remember at all, that really embarrassed me, as he said I had to be making that all up....I still have this friend and she remembers! that in cident.....we didn't know how to report that....;42.5316;-83.5261999999999
