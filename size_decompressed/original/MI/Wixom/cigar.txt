Cigar-shaped, flying object sited on 06/05/2014, over the City of Wixom, Michigan.;2014-06-05 16:20:00;2 minutes;Cigar Shaped, flying object sited on 06/05/2014, over the City of Wixom, Michigan. At about 4:20 pm on Thursday, June 5, 2014, the sky was sunny and clear, with no clouds, the temperature was 78 degrees Fahrenheit, humidity 25%, wind 11mph. While traveling east bound on I-96 in a Ford F-150, my brother-in-law and I both saw an unidentifiable flying object over the City of Wixom.  We exited I-96, onto Wixom Road, traveling North bound and could not find the object anywhere in the sky after our turn. The object was cigar shaped and whitish in color.   It appeared to be slightly West of town, which is North-East of where we were, when we saw it.  It seemed to be hovering over Wixom, not moving.  We traveled a mile or so, watching it and trying to determine what it could be.  He spotted it first, miles before I saw it.  We were traveling at just under 70 mph. We called my sister with a report of this incident.  She called our best friend and then, the Wixom Police Department, the WOMC (104.3 FM) radio station, finally, the National UFO Reporting Center.  She asked each of them to let her know if anyone else reports a sighting of this event. She was instructed by the NUFORC to have each of us to sit down and independently write out our own reports of this sighing as soon as we returned home that evening.  We had company over the weekend, so this was my first opportunity to make my report of the incident.;42.5316;-83.5261999999999
