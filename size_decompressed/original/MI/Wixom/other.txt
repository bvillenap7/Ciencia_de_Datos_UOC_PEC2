I think late 80s early 90s. early evening lunch break with 2 friends in my car in a strip mall parking lot.  Nice warm weather, then A THUNDEROUS, and I mean a HUGE noise, startles us and makes us get out and look out of the car.   An unbelievably loud and huge 100ft up high airship is slowly moving over.  It had windows and resembles an old telephone pole.   My friends and I and everyone else in the lot are looking up.  I run inside to my work phone and call my manager that lives down the street in a nearby apartment.  She answers.  I say, can u here that noise and she says yes, what is that?  I told her its a gigantic ufo hovering over Wixom.   Only one of my friends remembers, and the other only kinda.   I went home told my mom and friend and listened  to the news and there was nothing.  Not only that but I've checked online since a lot, and have never heard of anything like it, never. why?  The physical explanation I type in never ever matches any similar.  Why not?  Ever?  My description doesn't match any google search ever.  I never even thought to call the police that day.  I wish I did. why didn't I or anybody else call?  It should have shown up online eventually right?  Never not once.  Please respond if u have any answers or insight.  Please. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
