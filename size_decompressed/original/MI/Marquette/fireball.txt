Green Fireball-Upper Peninsula of Michigan;2008-12-22 13:00:00;3 minutes;Green Fireball-Upper Peninsula of Michigan The object was lime-green perfectly spherical. It flickered like a fire. The object followed the coastline from Little Presque Isle to Garlic Island (6 miles). The object took roughly 3 minutes to cover this distance, so I estimate that it was travelling at 120mph. It was only 200 feet off the coast at an altitude of between 80-90ft. It was no larger than a small car. The object made no noise.
