When I looked out of the deck window at around 4:00 a.m., I was surprised to see a red flashing light. I live near a ski hill, so I figured they were working on some tower or something on the top of the hill.  Then, I realized that the visual line would be wrong. I walked to the window and looked. The light was sort of like a flashing signal light. Shortly thereafter, four smaller steady light appeared in a straight line. I wanted to go outside, but I was rather frightened. If this happens again, I plan to drive to the hill for video confirmation.;46.5777999999998;-87.4552000000003
