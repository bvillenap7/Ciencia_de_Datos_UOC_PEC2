It was so low, others had to have seen it.  It was small and the bottom was striped like a bullseye.  There was no noise. At the time K.I. Sawyer AFB was nearby. I had taken the dog outside, I stayed on the second floor deck, and looked at the sky.  It was overcast, the kind that gives off a daylight glow.  The small craft came over, just above the tree line. No light, no noise.  I turned and watched as it flew toward and into the low clouds around the power co. smokestacks.  The craft would have flown over Northern Michigan University and a fly-by of the hospital (with all those windows).  I could not have been the only one to see it.  There was a Miss  ?? Pageant on TV that night.  The next day the papers headlines were about tanks going down the streets of one of the Balkan Countries.;46.5777999999998;-87.4552000000003
