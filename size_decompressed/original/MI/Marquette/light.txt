I watched what i believed to be an unusually bright star or planet for several minutes then the light began to fade.  As the light began to brighten it moved slightly to the left, in this case the south, of my position then moved away from me to west towards the downtown area of Marquette.;46.5777999999998;-87.4552000000003
Photographed mysterious light over Lake Superior.;2015-03-15 23:30:00;30 minutes;Photographed mysterious light over Lake Superior. I am a night photographer, and on this particular night was taking long exposure photographs at the beach on the shore of Lake Superior with a friend.   We noticed a very bright light hanging motionless and low in the sky over the woods way down the beach, about a mile or two away.  I figured it to be a planet, and continued with my shot.   When I looked at my exposures on the computer later that night, I noticed that the object had registered a circular, ostensibly autonomous light trail (instead of a clearly defined line that a planet would make as the earth rotates).  That is, it moved (or the camera moved) during what amounted to a 4 minute exposure. I am fairly confident that the camera did NOT move, as it was firmly planted into the sand and the shutter controlled with a remote release.  Also, there were lights from a few small cabins on the other end of the shore directly below the unidentified object which registered clean and with no evidence of camera shake or movement.   When I examined other images of the same scene, the light appears registering different motion but is extremely bright, bright enough to emit a starburst effect around the object during the long exposure.;46.5777999999998;-87.4552000000003
