We had no idea what it was and did not speak of it for years.;1974-06-01 00:00:00;5 minutes;We had no idea what it was and did not speak of it for years. My wife and I were driving back from Green Bay Wi. approx 11:00 on a Saturday night. My wife was sleeping and I saw an object tree topm level following us from us 2. I thought it was a helicopter. I awakened my wife to tell her about it. We stoped the car on a knoll and looked back and the craft crossed the road heading back west. The craft had flashing lights around it and it made us stare in ah for a few minutes and then moved toward the west over a bog. We have told only friends in the last 10 years or so. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We have assigned above an arbitrary date in 1974.  PD));46.5777999999998;-87.4552000000003
High altitude, high speed object traveled across the sky before dissapearing behind a cloud.;2000-03-12 13:30:00;20 seconds;High altitude, high speed object traveled across the sky before dissapearing behind a cloud. I in the parking lot of the local laundry mat looking up at the sky because it was a nice day and I was waiting for my wash.  I noticed an object that I thought at first was a seagul. I watched it further and realized that it was probably at a very high altitude, but it was moving pretty fast for that height.  For instance an airliner moves fairly slowly across the arc of the sky, this was on the order of three to four times as fast.  I also thought it might have been a baloon, but the shape wasn't quite right.  It was traveling in a south to southwestern direction coming in from over Lake Superior. The object eventually passed behind a cloud, and I lost sight of it.  It did appear to change direction but not significantly. Pretty unclonclusive but still I thought I would send in data in case someone else got another look at it, and it turned out to be more significant.;46.5777999999998;-87.4552000000003
