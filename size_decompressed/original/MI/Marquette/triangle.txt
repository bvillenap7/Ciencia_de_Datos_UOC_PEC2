Triangular UFO over marquette michigan;2010-04-16 01:00:00;About 6 seconds;Triangular UFO over marquette michigan Last night around 1:00 am myself along with another witness had noticed motion in the sky.  Both my friend and i had seen a very large triangular shape fly from one part of the sky to the next heading i believe northwest in a matter of 6 seconds at speeds ive never seen before . it was pretty low and very large as well as completely silent . If you held a quarter in your finger tips and put your arm out that is how big the object was as seen by us . It was blocking out some of the stars as it flew through the sky . It was so close that we were able to perfectly see the triangular shape with three large round lights as bright as the stars in the sky and about the same size . The lights were perfectly spaced apart from eachother at each point of the triangle . I could make out a faint shape of the craft and it was a differant shade of dark than the sky . About 5 minutes later after the sighting there was a jet flying roughly in the same direction almost as if tracking or monitoring the object . The jet i could hear clear as day and it was up much higher than this object . I called the local airport here and i was told that the tower shuts down at 10 pm and that there shouldnt have been any flights or activity at that time wich leads me to believe it was a military jet . But that isnt all that had happend , about 10 minutes prior to this UFO we had seen two differant stars that had been moving at high rates of speed and every few seconds they would pulse and then nothing . They would disapear and then show up pulsing at another place in the sky in a matter of seconds . We witnessed this for about 5 minutes and then they were gone and nothing else happend till the triangular craft .;46.5777999999998;-87.4552000000003
