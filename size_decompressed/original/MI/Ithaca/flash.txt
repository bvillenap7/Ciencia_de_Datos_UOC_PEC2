At approximately 22:35 Eastern Standard Time, while traveling north on US-27 just south of Ithaca, MI, I witnessed a very fast moving bright white light that suddenly exploded into a very bright white flash of light.  I was a front seat passenger looking out of my door window when I saw the fast moving light.  The light was traveling southward at an elevation of approximately 45 degrees above the horizon and from my position it seemed to be descending at a ten degree angle.  After about a second of observation the light suddently exploded into a bright white flash that lasted for a fraction of second.  The flash did not linger in the sky as an explosion would, and I did not see any trace of the light following the explosion.  The object seemed to be moving much faster than any meteor or debris that I've previously witnessed entering the atmosphere.  There were a few high altitude passanger jets in the immediate vicinity of the phenomenon from the position which I witnessed it occur.;43.286;-84.6109
