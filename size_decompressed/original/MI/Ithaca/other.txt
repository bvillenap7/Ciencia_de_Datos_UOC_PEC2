The light's;1987-06-01 17:00:00;15 MIN;The light's I will do the best i can.It was 3 miles west on M57 We had just turned of 127 NORTH at this point I told my Wife to look at lights just above the trees we pulled off rode to get a good look at this, we new very quickly it was not a plain.  The lights were blue, yellow, green, and red.  At that point we were both out of the car about 500 yards away from the lights at a fence row.  The lights were traveling very slow it appeared to be  very large and was heading directly toward where we were parked.  My wife jumped back into the car, eventually it was close enough I could tell it was the length of two football fields, and had 12 windows and had 4 layers,and was lit up like florescent lights. It looked like as if you were looking down a hallway but no one was in it roughly moving about 6 miles an hour and didn't pay no mind to us on the side of the road.  The windows were big enough to put a dump truck through them, about 150ft. in the air and right across the road. ! It looked as though a cloud had just formed from it, my wife got real scared I told her it wanted nothing to do with us because3 the car was still running and the music was still going on low.  The object went into the cloud as if it were a cloaking device but before it completely disappeared into the cloud we were leaving.It had to be as long as a football field ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
