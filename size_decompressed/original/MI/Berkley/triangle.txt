Air force jets trailed by something.;2009-07-08 23:00:00;1 minute;Air force jets trailed by something. At exactly 11pm ET a series of fast moving objects crossed the night sky East to West - counted at least 2 but maybe more...could have been air force jets from the sound that could be heard.  These objects were very high up with strobing light.  About :30 seconds after they passed overhead a separate blimp-like object / could have been three smaller objects in tight triangle formation, or a single blimp...very hard to tell. This set of lights trailed the just-passed set of lights, but much slower, as if left behind or dragged.  Weird.  Faint headlight light projected from the front of the 3 - similar to if you ever looked up in a movie theater and could see the projector light above you.  Creepy...don't care to see it again.  Curious if anyone else saw this????!;42.5039;-83.1823
