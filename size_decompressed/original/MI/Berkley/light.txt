My friend noticed it 1st, then I quickly stood to catch about 8-10 seconds of a solid white, VERY bright light, moving from a SW to NW direction.  We stood in silence as it vanished or dematerialized off into the night sky.   Within 5 minutes there were up to 7 planes flying in all directions in the same airspace. Not sure if they were commercial, military, or something else.   I'm not aware of any airforce bases in the area, or around Michiganâ€¦ .Maybe Canadian officials may have caught that sighing on their radar from Windsor, IF they in fact have staffed facilities there to record and document such events.;42.5039;-83.1823
