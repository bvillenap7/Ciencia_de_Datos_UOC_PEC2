At about 5 minutes to midnight in the Northern sky, I witnessed a red flashing sphere, almost like a fireball but without a tail or trail behind it.   It made no sound and was traveling from East to West at a speed of a jet in the sky for about 20 seconds and then seemed to flash a few times before disappearing into the night sky.;42.5039;-83.1823
