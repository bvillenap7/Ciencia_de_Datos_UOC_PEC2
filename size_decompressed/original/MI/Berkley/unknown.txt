Contrail of object falling to Earth;2008-02-11 18:00:00;6 minutes;Contrail of object falling to Earth Driving home from work this evening at approximately 6pm ET noticed what appeared to be a contrail in the sky.  However, upon examining this streak more closely as driving and stopped at a traffic light, I could then clearly tell that the trail was dark black, like smoke from something burning, and also, this object, whatever it was, was falling from the sky, not flying.  The contrail was arching downward toward the ground like a rainbow at a very steep descent.  The direction was West to East.  Not sure if anyone else saw this or would notice it...I could not see any fire or tell what type of object was creating the contrail...but something was falling fast, so it appeared!;42.5039;-83.1823
