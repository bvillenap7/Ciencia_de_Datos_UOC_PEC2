Triangle craft with moving white light during meteor shower.;1986-06-01 22:00:00;1 hour plus;Triangle craft with moving white light during meteor shower. My husband, my two young daughters and myself went to a parking lot of a building that was under construction.   We wanted to view the meteor shower from the darkest place within walking distance near our home.   It was a very clear sky that night and the starts were bright.   While we were standing there looking up, waiting for another meteor, I noticed something unusual.  There was a small white light moving.   As I watched it, I noticed that it stayed within the area of three other white lights that made a triangle shape.   I was finally able to get my family to see it among the thousands of stars.  We watched it for a long time.   The three lights in the shape of a triangle were absolutely still.  Whatever it was, it never moved from its position.  The white light that moved never moved out of the triangle shape.  It went moving around all over within the triange.  Sometimes it would move slow, sometimes fast, and sometimes it would stop.  We finally were tired of looking up.  We walked back home and could still see it.  I have no idea whether it was close or far.  There was no sound.
