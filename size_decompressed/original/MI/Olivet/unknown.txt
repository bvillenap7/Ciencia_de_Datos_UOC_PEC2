I am not sure of the exact date but it was the time of the asteroid showers in the summer of 2002.  My neice (32 years old) went out at approximately 9:45 p.m. not knowing that the asteroid showers were not to take place until 5:00 am or so in the morning.  She came rushing in the house and said she had seen the comet come down through the atmosphere with a very large tail.  Not knowing what she was talking about..I explained that we were not suppose to see a comet and that what we were to see was just an asteroid shower that was to take place in the early morn. She was really frighten so I went outside with my binoculars and telescope.  In the west, approximately at 10.40 p.m.  I seen on the horizon which look to be a very bright light.  I assumed it was a planet and set my scope on it. Because of atmospheric conditions I seen this very bright light jump all over in my scope.  I realized then that it was not a planet and told my niece and my 2 children (ages 12 and 13) to look in that direction.  It sounds really stupid but it had a very bright light in the middle and a red light on one side and a green light on the other.  I hate saying that because it seems like I am making it up.  I watched it through my scope for about 5 minutes trying to get my husband to come out when it started to ascend slowly straight up.  About 40 seconds later, it just shot up in the sky to where it seemed to be a bright star.  It hovered there for a minute and proceeded to travel north.  I looked at it until I could see it no more.  This all was in the vicinity of where my niece seen the comet. I could not tell the shape of the craft due to it's position and light.;42.4457;-84.9027
