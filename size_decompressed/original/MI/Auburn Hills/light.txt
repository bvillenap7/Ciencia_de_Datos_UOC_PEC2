Hovering light.;2015-06-23 22:00:00;~ 1 minute;Hovering light. This is a second time I've seen this in a month.  Both times, it was about 10pm, and I was driving north on I-75 before GLC.   First time, it was on the left side.  This time it was on the right.  I chalked it up to a helicopter with a high beam light directed towards my general direction.  It hovered and seems to move slowly.  The lights were bright white/yellow and flickers.   I saw it again today and saw how it disappeared into the sky (into the distance until it disappeared).  It was too fast to be a helicopter.  The light dimmed really fast, and I had enough daylight to be able to see the shape but I could see the light dimming quickly, turning into a speck, and it disappeared off into a distance.  All within a couple of seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the time above.  PD));42.6584;-83.2363999999999
