It was reflecting the sunlight off of it self.I then got the binoculars and looked, it was a solid reflecting object that seemed under control.I then noticed a similar object farther off into the distance hovering also.It might have been the international space station watching the comet temple 1 impact,but the space staion does not hover from side to side at 10,000 ft.!It then slowly disappeared as the sun was setting.I know it was not fireworks of any sorts.

Moving stars?;2008-06-29 23:00:00;1 hour;Moving stars? At 11:00 p.m. 6/29/8 me and my girlfriend went into the back yard to observe the night sky. While we were sitting on the swings we noticed what I thought were stars seperate from one another. One object was brighter than the other, the brighter star moved then stopped and moved again and stayed in place for hours.The dimmer star moved a little faster and stayed in place for the same duration as the other object.They moved probably about 150 miles apart from one another and like I said stayed in place for as long as we were observing.30 minutes later another star moved as a jet flew in its direction.This star also stayed in place after it moved out of the path of the jetliner.It appears as if there are many ufos that resemble stars in the night sky!.I have had many sightings on and around the 4th of july,maybe the aliens get brave and move closer to earth to view the fireworks,I dont know.I know how a satellite moves and looks and satellites dont stop and go and seperate from one another then stay stationary for the rest of the night. But then again who knows what kind of new technology Nasa might have.;42.6584;-83.2363999999999
