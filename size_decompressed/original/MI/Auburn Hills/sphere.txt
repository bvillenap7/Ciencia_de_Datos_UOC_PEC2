I was sitting on the patio when my young daughter heard an airplane. I looked to the sky to spot it for her and that's when I saw it. It looked like an ordinary star, except it was very sunny with a few clouds.  Certainly too light out to see any stars. This star was also unique in the fact that it was moving.  It was at about the same height as the clouds and was moving very slowly.  Now, I have seen airplanes in the sky when the sun would shine on the fusulage and I know that this is not what I saw today.  This star was moving very slowly in an eastely direction, yet it would subtly move to the left and right. It moved very slowly and eventualy out of sight.;42.6584;-83.2363999999999
