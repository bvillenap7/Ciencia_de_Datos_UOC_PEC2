I was driving east on Walton Blvd in Auburn Hills just over the bridge, where the neighborhoods start and out of the corner of my eye I looked out my passenger window and thought I saw a cell phone tower with a green light.  It wasn’t a cell tower at all it was one dark shaped but triangular and had a green light, a red light and 3 white light beams pointing in different directions no higher than a cell tower so very close to the ground.   I kept driving and it didn’t move, I made the split second decision to turn around and see if it was still there because I kept telling myself it was something more.  Literally, maybe 1/4 mile or less and this object was way past Lapeer Rd. so far that I had to turn around because there was no way I was going to catch up to this thing (I was going 60mph) and instead of this being so distinctive, it was getting further and further away at a speed that is unrelatable.   Ironically, tonight there are 50mph winds, this was definitely no helicopter and definitely not a plane because this thing was low, I mean the same height as a cell tower.  When I first saw it, it just stayed in one place and by the time I had turned around it was so far in front of me it couldn’t have been a plane because the distanced this thing traveled in a short amount of time maybe 30-45 seconds its impossible and extremely unexplainable.  The picture of this thing is burned into my skull.;42.6584;-83.2363999999999
