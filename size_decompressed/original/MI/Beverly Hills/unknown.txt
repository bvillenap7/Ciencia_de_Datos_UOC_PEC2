Today, Thursday, October 16, 2014, at roughly 7:30 AM, I saw three very bright lights, in the shape of a pair of headlights and a light on top.  There seemed to be nothing holding them together.  They were moving at what seemed to be a little faster than a passenger jet.  The back headlight was going first, then they lined up, and the front headlight continued first after that.  That suggested that I saw the front and the back of the craft.  Soon after, I saw a passenger jet going in the same direction. I am a 13 year old male that was waiting for the school bus.;42.5194;-83.2482
