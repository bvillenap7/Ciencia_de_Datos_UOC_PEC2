I saw a very large metal craft, cigar shaped, flying extremely low and fast going from North to South over 13 Mile Rd about a mile or two from where I was.  I honestly thought it was a 747 making a crash landing on Woodward Ave,  it was that big!  This is in a highly populated area so surely someone else saw this thing.  I thought it might possibly be a blimp, but after checking around the web, there are no events where you might find a blimp in this area.  Also, I've never seen a blimp move at that rate of speed.  This was at 7:15 PM, still very sunny outside at that time of day.;42.5194;-83.2482
