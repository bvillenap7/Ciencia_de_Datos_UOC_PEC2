Noticed 2 very bright objects very close together east by southeast. Thought they were planets at first, they were as bright as Jupiter which was the brightest object in the sky to the south. Watched them for a minute and they simply faded away. They never moved and were not covered over by clouds, there wasn't a cloud in the sky. They literally disappeared before my eyes! Definitely not planets, stars, or an airplane.;42.5194;-83.2482
