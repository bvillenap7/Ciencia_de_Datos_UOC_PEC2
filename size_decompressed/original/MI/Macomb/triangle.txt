bright triangular object flying slowly across low evening sky;2002-11-18 19:40:00;minute;bright triangular object flying slowly across low evening sky it was about 7:40pm, my girlfriend and i were walking my dog around my block. when we first left my house i noticed a very bright light low in the evening sky, which turned out to be 3 bright lights forming a triangular pattern. i was stunned by how bright the lights were reflecting, and how slowly the object moved. after we got halfway around the block i looked back to notice it moving across the sky, very slowly. i live near an airport, and the lights and slow movement the object made was nothing i've ever seen before.;42.6543503030303;-82.9028684848483
