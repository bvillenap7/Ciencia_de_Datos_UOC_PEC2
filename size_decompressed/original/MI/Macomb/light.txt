The three of us were at a Private Island (Located minutes from the end of Anchor Bay Drive Clay Mi)  for a Event Gathering of under 100 people.Red Glow of Constant Color on Bottom of flat black angular UFO Just Under Clowds Passing Just under the Moon (distance under moon was the size of the moon) witnessed by mechanical engineering, logistics specialist, peace officer. Seen on 07/04/2009 22:24 for 4 min 19 secs. If the moon were 12:00 the Red Object came out of the horizon at 07:30 then increased altitude steadily with the same speed and Heading of direction (Reason Im not saying North South East or West Is I was not familiar with the surroundings). At first glance thought to be Red coast guard helicopter, but as It passed under the moon we could see It was creating Its own Red light. The Red light was under the flat black angular UFO.The best description of the red glow like looking at Red Glowing Moliton Steel.The reason I use the tearm angular Is,I cant explaine the shape of It. Ive tried to sketch a drawing but I just cant seem to get It exact. I know what It Is not. It was not the International space station because It was on ground side of the Clowds. It was not a Jet,Helicopter,Blimp,Small Air Craft because It had no Tracker Beacon or vapor disturbance. It was not a hot air balloon because It was too fast and Entering proximity of no fly zone of Selfridge Air National Guard Base. We lost sight of the UFO because of the Buildings and tree line elevation. This was Real It was Unknown and It was In the Air.The Slang Military/Airman tearm for this is Rock=RAUC R=Real A=Airborn U=Unknown C=Craft.To Describe my feelings I would have to say at first Jumpy/shaky but within a few minutes after fulfillment/Collected. When I got home at 02:44 I could not sleep untill after 06:00 and Only slept for 3 or 4 hours;42.6543503030303;-82.9028684848483
6 orange lights in formation 2 traveling bright orange lights Macomb, MI;2012-08-11 22:00:00;10 minutes;6 orange lights in formation 2 traveling bright orange lights Macomb, MI I was driving down m59 when I noticed a strange light formation in the northern sky.  6 small lights in an angled circular formation and a brighter one approaching them from the left.  As the 6 formation lights do their own thing and begin to disappear I pull over.  Keeping my attention on the bright light I started to record and a second bright light followed the path of the first and came out of nowhere.  They both faded and disappeared in their transit.  They looked orange to me and I don't know if anyone else saw it.;42.6543503030303;-82.9028684848483
White oval disc shaped light following my car.;2015-10-16 15:30:00;A few minutes or so;White oval disc shaped light following my car. Driving down the road and I noticed this oval disc shaped light flying around in the sky.  I assumed it was some sort of spotlight or airplane but the craft kept changing directions and getting closer then backing away, hovering over the woods in the distance.  I then stopped at a red light and it was still moving.  When I turned it kept following me, but eventually disappeared behind the woods after a minute or so.;42.6543503030303;-82.9028684848483
