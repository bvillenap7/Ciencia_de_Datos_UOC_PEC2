I saw the same or similar obect twice on Sunday from my living room window. In brief, I observed a silent wingless object traveling North-East at approximately 6:00pm.  Weather: Broken clouds, unlimited visibilty. The object I noticed was first thought by my to be a bird but I noticed that there was no flapping motion of wings.  There was also no wings as if it were an airplane.  I frequently see F-16's flying out of Selfridge and this object had the same type of speed only no wings and no noise.  I obesrved the object until it moved out of view from my living room window. Distance to object: 2-3 miles and altitude again to be estimated to be between 3,000-10,000ft. A few minutes later after I lost sight of obect, another object flying the same route and altitude was witnessed again.  Either the same object or an identical 2nd object. Again, the sighting is very close to Selfridge ANG. I am a physicist, engineer, and have flight experience.  This object(s) was not an airplane, balloon, helicopter, kite, or bird.;42.6543503030303;-82.9028684848483

Same as above.;2015-11-28 20:00:00;10 minutes;Same as above Looking out by front window at 20:00 we saw a number of UFO's with orange lighting around 2000 feet in the sky.  The objects were moving from north to south very slow.  One craft split from the group going east at very high speed until I could not see the light of the craft, about 3 seconds.  Another split from the group about the same time and went straight up until I lost sight of its light.  Both crafts came back at almost the same time as fast as they both left.   The night was very clear, and as the craft passed over the roof of my house we ran to the back of the house to see them but they all left before they reached the view of my rear windows.;42.6543503030303;-82.9028684848483
