Cigar-shaped craft, all glowing orange.;2017-08-01 21:45:00;5 minutes;Cigar-shaped craft, all glowing orange. Lights first seen outside window.  They looked quite close.  The cigar shaped objects were glowing orange, like they were on fire, but the whole object was orangy red with no exhaust or flame trail.   We went outside to see the objects which then proceeded further North, and then straight up in the sky until disapearing into outerspace.  The dogs would not come outside with us, which was really strange.;42.6543503030303;-82.9028684848483
Slow-moving Cigaresque Craft;2019-08-09 21:10:00;6 seconds;Slow-moving Cigaresque Craft On the evening of August 9, 2019, I observed a cigaresque craft travel very slowly at an extremely high altitude passing across my view of the moon.  This was at approximately 9:10 p.m.  The craft disappeared into the clouds after roughly 6 seconds and only a few seconds later, a commercial airliner was traveling a perpendicular path to the cigar craft at a lower altitude at regular-plane speed.;42.6543503030303;-82.9028684848483
