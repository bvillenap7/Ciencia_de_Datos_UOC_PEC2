Large white object observed......;2002-09-30 20:50:00;1 min;Large white object observed...... i noticed the object first when i was traveling in my friends car, i noticed it in the sky somewhat above the tree line where i usually see planes before their ascent. (My home is located near a small airport, berz-macomb.) When i first saw the object i realized that it could not be a plane or a helicopter, due to the size of the light. From my view the light was as big as if i was extending my arm and looking at the tip of my pinky finger. It was a constant bright white light, with no other lights around it. After watching it proceed from left to right on my view of the sky, it suddenly changed course and dissapeared rather quickly into the horizon.;42.6543503030303;-82.9028684848483

This lasted about 15 minutes and each light would dim and then disappear.  There was no sound at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Bright Glowing orbs... get brighter then dimmer.. sometimes 3-4... glide back and forth;2016-12-03 20:45:00;3 hours;Bright Glowing orbs... get brighter then dimmer.. sometimes 3-4... glide back and forth I've reported this sightings in the past.  I don't believe it was on this site that I had reported it.. these lights have been showing up since November of 2014..  I have numerous cell phone videos of these glowing objects from the passed couple of years.  I don't see a pattern to when they will show up but all last summer 2016 every couple days they would apear anywhere from 20 minutes to 2-3 hours hovering and at times all of a sudden another will appear (not as bright as the first one) right next to it or possibly more (have only ever seen 4  One time).  They glow a white/orange color but when take binoculars and zoom in you get what seems like every single color illuminating (yes like a star) and here is where the star theory dies.... these objects HAVE been seen below the clouds... what is interesting is when first one appears it is always the brightest and dims then gets bright again and moves slowly gliding right to left... and when they leave it's just boom...GONE.  (For whatever reason it is always the same exact location/spot it shows up to, then moves right or left from there)  (Have videos);42.6543503030303;-82.9028684848483
