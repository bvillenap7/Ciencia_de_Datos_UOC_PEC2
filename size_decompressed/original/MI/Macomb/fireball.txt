I was woke up abruptly this morning about 4 am and seen 1 red fireball about the size of a large grapefruit hovering on my bedroom wall where the ceiling meets the wall, almost straight in front of me. It did not make any noise or wake my husband or dog, only me. I just shut my eyes and said to myself I'm not afraid. Opened my eyes after a minute and it was gone.  I was not dreaming and I did not imagine this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.6543503030303;-82.9028684848483
