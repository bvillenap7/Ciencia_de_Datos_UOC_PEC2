It was traveling from south to north east. I was higher than any buildings, yet lower than the scattered clouds.  Soon after we observed it we watched an additional nine of the identical red objects, traveling at the same slow speed, forming a loose curve to the west. We watched as one of the last ones went lower and passed two or three of the objects in front of it and rejoined the formation. After we watched them go to the east, a 10th object appeared and followed the same flight pattern. There was no breeze and only intermittent clouds, and no sound was heard. My wife insisted that it was just fireworks being shot off from a subdivision south of our home, I disagree since they didnâ€™t rise up from the ground, there was trace of a fuse being burnt, and the followed the same constant course where as fireworks would be scattered over a wide area. The last object disappeared from our line of vision around 2330.;42.6543503030303;-82.9028684848483
