floating object that made no sound and was gone in an instant.;2002-08-15 22:15:00;20 minutes;floating object that made no sound and was gone in an instant. It was a perfectly clear night and we were all out on the patio. We spotted something far in the northwest just kind of sitting in the sky. None of us knew what it was, but noone wanted to say what I was thinking. It would then slowly move a little toward us south in the sky with a steady small light on the bottom and lights on each side. It took about 15 minutes to move what seemed a half mile then would stop again. Now I listened for a sound, and there was nothing. Now it was a very quiet night and we were far from any road. I went in the house for a moment and when I returned, it was gone. Noone knew where it went. I know what I saw and it wasn't a plane or a helicopter.

Loud noise and vibration caused by unknown aircraft;2021-06-01 01:05:00;Less than one minute;Loud noise and vibration caused by unknown aircraft At 1:05 I was woken by the sound of a large aircraft and the sensation of my whole home shaking. I listened as the noise came closer and then passed my house. I did not see bright lights or the craft itself, truth be told I was scared to look. The noise was peculiar to me. I live near Selfridge and I know what the big helicopters sound like. It was similar in a way but didn’t have the distinct chopping sound, more of a mechanical engine hum. It seemed to be very low and close to my house. I tried to see if my Ring camera picked it up, but there was nothing. Neighbors did not hear anything, but I am convinced in what I experienced. I’m a 35 year old with a graduate degree and a healthy dose of skepticism for this kind of thing. Whether it was government or alien produced, I don’t know. I’m just hoping that sharing this will help someone to connect the dots.;42.6543503030303;-82.9028684848483
