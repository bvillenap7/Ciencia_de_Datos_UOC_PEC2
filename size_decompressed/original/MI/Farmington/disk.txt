Low-Flying Silent Gray Disc.;1970-07-01 21:00:00;Few seconds;Low-Flying Silent Gray Disc. The date given for my report corresponds to another report in your database, from Warren, Michigan, for a sighted object matching the description of what I saw.  I was too young at the time to keep track of dates, but it occurred during the height of summer in either 1969 or 1970.  I’d guess it was later at night, though, maybe 9pm, when it was still quite light enough outside to see things clearly. The object travelled west to east, slowly and silently, directly over my family’s house in Farmington, Michigan.  From below, it was circular, gray, with a flashing white light running around in a circle on its underbelly.  I only saw it for a few seconds, and I didn’t think to ascertain its diameter, but in my memory I have always seen it as on the scale of the width of the house, say 40-50 feet.  As low as it was, I was astounded that I could hear nothing from it. I saw it from my open bedroom window, looking up directly underneath it.  I ran to the living room, begging my parents to look out the front and see the flying saucer.  Their response was along the lines of:  Pshaw, get to bed.”   I went back to the bedroom, but stayed up to listen to the flying saucer sighting story on the 11pm news.  There was no such story.  I went through the newspaper the next day, with the proverbial fine-toothed comb, looking for a report.  Nothing.  I thought the neighborhood would be abuzz with talk of the flyover.  I never heard a peep.  I could not understand how something so extraordinary could go completely unnoticed, except by me. And now also by your report-filer from Warren.
