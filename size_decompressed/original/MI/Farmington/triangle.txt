Strange triangular object gliding across the sky in Farmington Michigan.;2006-12-24 20:00:00;5 Minutes;Strange triangular object gliding across the sky in Farmington Michigan. I was gazing out my window when i noticed a bright light approaching. I was thinking to myself, Thats going way to slow to be a jet. I went out onto my patio and watched it approach. As it was coming, no sound was heard. It was not to high as it approached, it was rather low. 5000-6000 feet maybe. As it was directly over me it was triangular shaped with what looked to be two jets off of the back. There were white beacon lights on each edge of the triangular shape. As it went over, it was completely silent. I knew it wasnt a jet because of its speed. It was going slow, almost hovering. Then, it was right in the path of an oncoming jet plane, luckily it did move out of the way. Then, it picked up speed and made a southeasterly turn and picked up speed, then it went out of sight. I never did hear any sound from that triangular craft. It was chilling. I know what i saw was a UFO.;42.4784311904763;-83.3895928571427
