Driving East on Grand River Ave and noticed a flash in the sky. What I saw was a teardrop shaped mass flying north.   Speed unknown and height was at least hundreds of feet in the air.   The shape was not a plane.  Not sure if any blimps in the area.  The shape of the object was very strange.;42.4784311904763;-83.3895928571427
