Bright light moving from one horizon to the other in less than 40 seconds;2010-08-03 22:41:00;40 seconds;Bright light moving from one horizon to the other in less than 40 seconds Very short sighting.  We were looking for the Northern Lights, as they were forecast to be visible. Object appeared on the Northern edge of the horizon as a small round light.  It traveled in a N to S direction, very high in the sky.  It did NOT blink, have any colored lights or appear to change shape. It moved so quickly that it went from the Northern Horizon to the Southern horizon in less than 40 seconds. While I am NOT a UFO buff, I have spent many nights outside watching the sky for various reasons.  To pass the time, star gaze etc. and even count the amount of airplanes in the sky.  I am 45 years old and a stable individual with a clean mental history.  I know how to identify an airplane, as I have observed many planes in the air.  Whatever this object was? it was FAST, very, VERY FAST!  In the section of sky I could view, it would take a normal airplane at LEAST 7 to 11 minutes to cover the same distance.;43.0301;-86.1865000000013
