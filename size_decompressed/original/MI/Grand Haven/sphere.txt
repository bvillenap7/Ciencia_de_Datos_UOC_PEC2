At about 21:30 hours on the evening of May 3, I saw a light in the sky, appeared at first to be a falling/shooting star. Object didnt leave a tail behind it and did not travel in a straight line, so a star is rules out. It looked to be a sphere of light, at first it was falling straight down then started to move in a 45 degree angle towards the ground. Object disappeared behind the trees, maybe crashed or landed.;43.0301;-86.1865000000013
