Bright white object wandering over New Baltimore, MI;2013-04-03 05:30:00;7 minutes;Bright white object wandering over New Baltimore, MI Object moved an in consistent speed heading from northwest in the direction of southeast. First spotted at 5:30. Consistent bright white light, about ten times brighter than the North Star.  There was no sound. No blinking lights.  Object appeared the same from when it was heading towards me as when it was heading away from me. It did not seem to move at consistent pass.  It wandered across the sky. It was a perfectly clear night. I first mistook the object for a star until I referenced it with near tree to indicate it was in fact moving. I watched it pass by over by until it fainted it the horizon which would have been in Canada at that time. From first site until its disapearance was about 7 minutes.  I have only ever seen a light this bright before and it was on a helicopter search light in the middle of the night.;42.6764322580645;-82.7801677419357
