Reflective slow moving white ball;2021-05-16 15:45:00;3 minutes;Reflective slow moving white ball White/silver ball seemed to be hovering in the air. It caught my eye because as it started moving, the sun seemed to reflect off of it making it glimmer every couple seconds. Movement was slow and controlled, definitely too big to weather balloon and moved too slowly to be a plane. It left no exhaust trail either. It even seemed to appear and disappear quickly. Sighting only lasted 3 minutes or so and it just disappeared into a cloud. I was able to get photos and videos.;42.6764322580645;-82.7801677419357
