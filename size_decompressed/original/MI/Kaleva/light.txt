Light approached from the SE nother approached from the N close proximinity. ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites??  PD));1998-05-17 23:20:00;7 minutes;One light approached from the SE.   Another approached from the N.  Approached one another in close proximinity.  Did not come together.  Passed each other, barely, then stopped.  Altitude was very very high.   The light that approached from the North remained stationary.  The SE light changed direction and headed North.  It began to zig zag, then stopped, paused for a few seconds and then sped off really fast to the north, then just blinked out.    I don't know what happened to the other. I was to intent on watching the one moving. P.S.   The northern bound light turned red while zig-zagging, then back back to white,just before it sped off. ((NUFORC Note:  Satellites??
