I awoke 3:00 AM Feb 14,2011.  (Time an date are Apx.)   I seen a bright glowing light beyond the trees behind the house.  I thought it was a fire.  Then it slowly started to rise, at about tree top level. I ran and got a camera.  By the time I got outside with the camera it was just a orange spot in the distant sky.  I am emailing the photos.;45.8248999999997;-88.0659999999996
