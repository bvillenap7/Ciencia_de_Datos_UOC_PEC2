White object seen moving across sky near the Menominee River.;2001-07-28 22:45:00;About 2 minutes;White object seen moving across sky near the Menominee River. My brother,two girls we had recently met, and myself were all sitting on a deck over- looking the Menominee River when I looked in the sky above the treeline on the opposite side of the river and saw a tiny very dim light moving quickly horizontal above the treeline.By this time we were all watching it and I just thought it was a satellite, but then the object slowed down and it became extremely bright and grew in size it looked like a helicopter's searchlight shining at us, it was white and I judged it to be about 2-4 miles away and about 3,000 feet above the ground.After it slowed and increased its brightness which lasted about 20 seconds it slowly moved straight away from us and dimmed until it looked like a tiny moving star, and then it dissappeared under the treeline.The object was totally silent throughout the entire incident.
