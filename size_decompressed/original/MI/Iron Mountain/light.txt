Four unexplained lights seen near highway in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan;2008-12-28 01:00:00;30 seconds;Four unexplained lights seen near highway in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan I was returning to my home town of Ishpeming, Michigan with my wife and her sister.  We were returning from a medical checkup I had in Madison, Wisconsin.  The night sky was clear.  It was about 1 AM.  It was the end of December 2008.  Leaving Iron Mountain, Michigan we turned north on M-95.  We went only a few miles when I noticed 4 white lights off to the right and barely above the pine trees.  (I was in the passenger front seat.  My wife was sleeping in the back seat.  And her sister was driving.)  I told my wife’s sister to look.  We both watched the lights.  They each looked about the size of a silver dollar.  The lights were not overly bright and looked an inch apart.  Then suddenly the 4 lights changed to 2 lights that appeared to be the shape of crescent moons about 9-12 inches apart.  Again they were not overly bright.  We were traveling north.  The lights appeared to be moving south south-west.  At first we thought it might have something to do with possible towers in the area.  We have never these lights before.  We have traveled this route countless times before.  I have since been along the same highway four times during the day and night.  Any towers we saw had red lights.  Nothing like what we had seen that night.;45.8248999999997;-88.0659999999996
Glowing bright green light/orb falling to earth from the stars;2009-08-31 20:45:00;15 seconds;Glowing bright green light/orb falling to earth from the stars It was a clear night, not a cloud in the sky. We observed what we thought was a bright star as we were driving down the road, all of a sudden the bright light turned bright green and shot straight down into the woods near by. At first I thought it was a flare but there was NO arch on top. The object looked like an orb or a circular light.  It didn't fall to the ground, it shot to the ground fast. It was the brightest green I have ever seen. My wife, both my children and myself saw this object.  With-in a few seconds we saw an approaching aircraft flying towards the airport near our city, it appeared that the object was getting out of sight. This wasn't a firework or flare as we could tell, because of the straight line it made into the woods.;45.8248999999997;-88.0659999999996
A slow low flying white light surrounded by a red orb hovering and turning 90* with no sound.;2012-07-03 21:45:00;2-3 minutes;A slow low flying white light surrounded by a red orb hovering and turning 90* with no sound. My wife and I were standing in our backyard around 9:45pm (30-40 minutes ago).   Because it is the day before Independence Day I was watching the numerous fireworks being launched from the surrounding neighborhood as my wife watered the garden around the side of our house.   Suddenly, as I was staring into the northwest sky a bright white light surrounded by a thick red orb appeared in the west.   At first I was struck by its brilliance and believed it to be a new firework that was designed to hang in the air.   I immediately called me wife from around the house so she could see the display as well.   As we watched the glowing orb it began to move laterally across the sky and grow in intensity.  As it moved, my wife and I stood in awe and contemplated the possibilities.   It was moving from west to east as I said: It can’t be a firework its moving laterally, it can’t be a flair because it has not gained or lost altitude.  Then the object slowly stopped and made ! a sharp 90* turn heading north.  We both commented on the fact that it made no sound   At this point I believe my wife was a little freaked out and she refused to watch any more.   I continued watching as the object slowly traveled north until it was obscured by my low view.   I noticed that during the 2-3 minutes this event lasted almost no fireworks from the nearby area could be seen or heard going off, as if everyone else in the area was also fixated on the same phenomenon.   Perhaps the most significant parts of this event for me was that the object flew to the north.   There is a small airport in the town of Iron Mountain were we live, only a few miles from our house.    The air traffic here goes south or west (Milwaukee, Detroit, Chicago or Minneapolis).   North is Lake Superior and Canada.   If this were a man made aircraft of any sort it is the first I have seen or heard of flying on a northern  path like this object did.   I don’t know what else to say.  I am a well educate! d and stable person living a domestic life in a small town and! now I h ave seen a UFO.;45.8248999999997;-88.0659999999996
