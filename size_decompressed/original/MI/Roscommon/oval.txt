Bright light in the sky, amazing speed and menuvers;1975-09-20 18:30:00;35 min;Bright light in the sky, amazing speed and menuvers Just about dusk around this date, a very bright light was observed in the NE sky as we were traveling N on M76 from our home in the AuSable river park just N of St Helen. We where going to the High School football game in Roscommon. My wife and I noticed this very bright light hovering just over the tree line. The sun had just set and it was still somewhat light to the west.  I pulled over to the side of the road and got out of the car, I started walking toward the object my wife (Marie) was yelling at me to get back in the car but I kept walking toward the tree line. I watched the object for a long time it just hovered over the trees about 300 yards away. There was a bright light shinning down to the ground right under the object. Without notice it moved to my right about 100 yards and stopped. It moved faster than my eye could catch it, it than shot stright up about 1000 ft and stopped, again faster than anything I had ever seen before. It than shot striaht up and disapeared into the stars, obsolutely unbelievable. I was taking Aviation Tech courses at the Kirtland Community College in Roscommon and had spent 4 years in the Navy as an aircraft Mech. I knew there was nothing like it on this planet.  We stopped in Roscommon at the first gas station and there were 2 other cars, around the curve in the road, that witnessed the same thing we did.  I now wish we had exchanged names. During this whole time the object never made a sound. But my wife sure did. The following morning I called the Oscoda Air Force base and reported the sighting, they stated they had no ops in the area and that others had called on the same thing.
