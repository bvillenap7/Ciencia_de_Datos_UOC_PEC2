My boyfriend and I were walking our dog and I am one to always watch the sky (it gorgeous) and I turned my head and saw a bright light and told my boyfriend.  He looked and saw it and after that the UFO  immediately dimmed but not enough to where We couldn't see it and it seemed to be slowly moving then it hovered and fa bit and disappeared completely.   We looked for it but couldn't find it until we started walking and our gaze lowered and we saw it in the sky ahead of us where it just hovered and moved slightly occasionally while dimming and brightening.  As I got to my house I ran in and grabbed my dslr cam and came back outside to find it gone.  I went back in for a few and went out again and it re appeared slightly higher in the sky.  It continued to do this and I am still watching it.  And now as I am thinking the fire flies were dropping like flies;43.425;-84.5913999999999
