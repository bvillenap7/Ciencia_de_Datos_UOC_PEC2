Objects traveling the magnetic north at extreme speed silently with ability to stop suddenly and change direction instantly;2007-10-20 23:00:00;20 min;Objects traveling the magnetic north at extreme speed silently with ability to stop suddenly and change direction instantly First person went outside, saw red lights went back in and got second oberver.  We witnessed a total of 18 objects which were obscured by a bright red light, they were low approximately 1000 - 500 ft off the ground (they came in over the tree tops) you did not see them from a long distance off, they were traveling south to north directly along the magnetic pole. They were approximately the size of a Cessna plane. They traveled in pairs one behind the other at an approximate lapse of two minutes and another pair would follow. The last pair, the one in the lead went off map north and the other caught up and turned 90 degress to the right after it had appeared to stop. They moved at an extreme rate of speed. There was not a whisper of a sound (as an object passes thru the atmosphere it displaces air thereby there should have been sound - there was not).  Looked at thru binoculars only could see light. Called 911 and reported the event and they stated they would advise officers in the area. The sky was bright and clear.  This was not a laser effect (one of the individuals has worked on stage with such items).;42.7531;-84.3989
