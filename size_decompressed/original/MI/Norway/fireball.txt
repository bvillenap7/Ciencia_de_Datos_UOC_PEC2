I KNOW WHAT I SAW,  RED CIRCULAR OBJECTS.......;2011-08-11 21:00:00;5-7 min;I KNOW WHAT I SAW,  RED CIRCULAR OBJECTS....... I exited the west door while leaving work.  To my left which was (SW), I saw 3 red circular objects flying (NE).  The first three were grouped vertically equally spaced, and travelling at the same speed.  When they just about got to the NW treeline another red ball appeared from the SW horizon, (traveling same path and speed as previous 3).   I then went and got 3 co-workers to witness this event.   While watching the 4th object, two more grouped (also vertically) came from the SW horizon and five more followed about 10-20 seconds apart.  There were 11 total.  All the same size, travelled at the same speed, appeared to be flying at the same altitude, and all flying in the same path/direction.
