I was speaking with my wife and sister-in-law when i noticed an object crossing the sky from West to East in a straight line.  The object was torroidal in shape with half of the radius (outer) in white and appeared luminescent.  The inner section was dark shaded fading to black in the exact center. When i initially spotted the object, (it was at an elevation of aprox. 45 degrees and with an extended arm, would be the size of a dime held between the thumb and index finger) i exclaimed What is that! i rose from the step, and advanced towards the driveway (North) to maintain my view.  My sister-in-law was able to capture a glimpse before it vanished behind the trees to the East of the house.  We scurried to the side yard (East of the house) where there is a fairly open field next to us.  It did not appear again. The field of view during the event was about 60 degrees incl. Skies are perfectly clear.  Wind is out of the WNW at 9 mph. Temp is 82 degrees.  Humidity is 35%.  Dewpoint is 54 degrees. Visibility 10 mi.  Ceiling unlimited.  (data from Weather channel). I will send a map and detail drawing via e-mail.;42.9263;-83.0407
