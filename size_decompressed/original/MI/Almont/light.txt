Upon looking up at Jupiter, (I have been tracking Jupiter since spring) i saw an object the size, brightness, and about 1 to 2 degrees below Jupiter.  Jupiter is due East in the sky and at about 35 degrees above the horizon.  The object was traveling due North at a constant elevation.  I watched the object for 10 minutes until it _faded_ out.  The object faded at a position of North-North-East.  It took about 10 seconds to fade out.  There were no perceived lights on the object.  There were at that time 5 aircraft in the sky traveling from East to West all with their running lights blinking.  Atmospheric conditions: Clear, moonless, wind less than 5mph, temp 40degF.;42.9263;-83.0407
