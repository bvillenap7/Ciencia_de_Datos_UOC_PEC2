It was still light out but not real bright sky. the lights then went out in an orderly fashion from left to right leaving nothing in the sky. no little black spots of aircraft or anything. I witnessed it myself and said what the hell was that? my friend eric who was driving the boat said oh i think thats a boat pretty far torwards shore i said no not that, there was some weird lights in the sky that just lit up and went out. everyone looked and they appeared again in a slightly different order or shape then went out one by one from left to right. we talked about it for a while and continued fishing till well after dark around 11:15! to 11:30 when out of the starry sky appeared a bright orange ball of light then quickly after about 5 more all at once, then going out from left to right and some other weird movements etc. then after about 15 seconds of seeing them the last one went out and a half mile or mile away to the north appeared them all instantly and faded out left to right. I grew up there and never have i seen anything like it. no sound, they appeared to be fairly close within 4 miles first time and later within a mile or so. very weird and startling.;45.297;-83.506
