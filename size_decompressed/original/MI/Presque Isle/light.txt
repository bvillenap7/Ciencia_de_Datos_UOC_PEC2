A white light in a rural orange and gray sky.;2005-08-22 19:42:00;3-4 minutes;A white light in a rural orange and gray sky. Fishing in the evening, alone in August, I witnessed the strange light in the western sky.  No other physical events i.e. sound, winds, etc. were evident. It is a rural area, no large signs or business billboards.  At most, there are a few homes on 10 acre parcels.;45.297;-83.506
