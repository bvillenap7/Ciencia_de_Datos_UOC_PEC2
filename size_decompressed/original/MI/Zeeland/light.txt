Me and my fiance and manager saw ufos;2012-02-25 20:00:00;2-5 minutes;Me and my fiance and manager saw ufos I am not quite sure on what day these events happen but they both happened at night.  my fiance saw two and i saw one when i was at work with my manager   .ive seen many sighting within this year . I was at work and me and my manager went out to smoke and i always look at the sky at night just to see if i see anything .We both saw one red dot that was flashing.we thought it was a plane and i watched it and i didnt see the green light that normally blinks or flashes and this object was going faster than any plane ive seen or a helicoptor,there were also no sounds following behind. The two crafts my fiance saw was two bright white lights in the sky and they flew next to eachother very slow and eventually came together and flew that way for a few minutes.eventually they separated again then stoped and it joined another light and  stoped.they flew for a couple of minutes as a triangle and eventually disapeared out of site. we have had many sitings at our apartment and have caught one video but when i played it back it was completly shaken then got distorted so it wasnt even clear to see . if you would like to hear more my email address is ((address deleted));42.8252000000001;-86.0105999999999

Star like object moving up, down, all over, silently about 12 seconds just at dark on cloudy night in S.W.sky.;2016-08-30 21:00:00;12 seconds;Star like object moving up, down, all over, silently about 12 seconds just at dark on cloudy night in S.W.sky. Thought it was a medium size star.  Stationary as my eye first caught it.  Thought it was the only star out. Same brightness as a star.  The sky was overcast, cloudy.  Then it moved to my right about 4 times faster than a plane, then on an angle down to my left.  Then squiggled all around then up then straight down.  No sound, no flashing lights, left no trail.  Thought maybe a shooting star but they don't go down then up.  I was coming out my front door to walk the dog.  It was just about dark out.  I was facing south west when I spotted it looking toward Holland;42.8252000000001;-86.0105999999999
