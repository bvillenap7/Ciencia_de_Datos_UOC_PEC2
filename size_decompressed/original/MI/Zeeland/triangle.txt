One sped up and passed several.  Than they all sped away.  We stop the car and got out and watched for a few minutes.  The lights were big and bright.;42.8252000000001;-86.0105999999999

It looked like from the shore of Lk. Michigan to just before Zeeland.  Though they each came separately.  They both stopped,  hovered,  and disappeared the same identical spot.  Lasted about 15 min.  They didn't flicker or make any noise.  Just about sun down.  a little after.  Moved very slow.;42.8252000000001;-86.0105999999999

Lights didn't flash I'm hoping to see others who saw this also.  Very large triangular shaped object with big bright lights.  Lights were white with red in center.  Saw on the 19th at 10:05 pm moving North to south very very slow.  No sound. Lights did not flash.  It goes on a slant up and down and below the tree line at times out of sight.   Then 20 seconds later appears going up so very slow in the same spot it went down.  Our city is about 1&1/2 miles in diameter and I saw it cross and it took 50 minutes.  What the heck?   I saw it again the next Wednesday, Oct. 22/2014 at 8:05.  It went from West to East.  Everything identical.  I saw it again on Saturday, Oct. 25, 2014 at 8:05.  West to East again.  Everything same as first 2 times except this time the neighbors dogs were barking non stop and the neighbors car alarm went off.  Getting creeped out.  Not sure I'm liking this any more.;42.8252000000001;-86.0105999999999
