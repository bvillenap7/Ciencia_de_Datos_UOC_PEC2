Zeeland lights.;2014-06-21 22:00:00;20 minutes;Zeeland lights They were round amber lights floating across the sky in Zeeland, Michigan.  We saw a few dozen.  At first they all seemed to be in a straight line but a few were travelling side by side.  Some appeared to touch each other.    My husband is a professional pilot and said they were not aircraft.  He said there were no port or starboard running lights.  He thought they were some type of lanterns attached to helium ballons that someone was lighting on the ground and releasing.    But it is raining steadily so I am somewhat doubtful.   When we went indoors the lights were still coming. We would like to know if others saw these lights.  Thanks.;42.8252000000001;-86.0105999999999

I was woke up at 4:47 am by an extremely loud jet plane sound right above my house, it rattled the windows, made the ceiling fan shake violently, as I jumped out of bed, the floor felt as if an earthquake was occurring.  The backyard looked lite up as if it were noon, the way the jet sounded & felt, I was certain that I was going to run out to see a plane crash into my neighborhood, however by the time I got to the dining room and looked out the slider to the backyard, it was pitch black outside and no signs of a jet or any aircraft, everything seemed peaceful and normal, then I ran to the front of the house and saw 2 circular lights in the eastern sky, they were side by side, one small and dim, the other was absolutely huge and extremely bright, neither one was moving or twinkling.  They just hung in the sky, in the same spot for 20 minutes, then both of them simply disappeared at the same second, without ever moving, just disappeared!  I grabbed my husbands cell phone and took a couple pictures and short video, which unfortunately neither do justice to the very large size of the one!!;42.8252000000001;-86.0105999999999
