Fireball with red pulsating aura moving north north east creating a slight to moderate wooshing sound;2010-07-04 23:17:00;60-90 seconds;Fireball with red pulsating aura moving north north east creating a slight to moderate wooshing sound Sitting on my front porch facing west I look up in the sky to my left (south) and I see a bright orange ball of light three times the size of a star and larger than a landing light of a large jet (like a ball of fire) coming at me from the south south west moving to the north north east (my left to my right as i look at it more closely I can see a red pulsating aura around the top side of the object.   As the object drew closer too me, I could hear a slight to moderate whooshing sound (not like the sound a jet engine would make) it then past almost directly over head then past me heading north north east.   When it moved a short ways past me the wooshing sound was no longer audible the object then made a slight arc to the north north east and continued a short ways.   The object was still quite visable when the fireball faded out and turned into a red point of light then went out of sight.  (This happend in a span of about 5 seconds)   The object looked the same coming at me, overhead and going away from me;42.8252000000001;-86.0105999999999
