Bright light low in the northern sky flashed and disappeared.;2018-04-30 22:15:00;5 minutes;Bright light low in the northern sky flashed and disappeared. At approximately 22:15 Eastern Time in the city of Zeeland just SW of Grand Rapids, I had gone outside from my place of work to smoke a cigarette.  I noticed low on the northern horizon at approximately 15 degrees above the horizon what appeared to be a planet or aircraft with a very bright landing light.   I took interest in it and decided to watch it for a bit during my break.  I was informed later that there are no planets visible on the northern sky.  The object did not appear to be moving.  I continued to watch it and pointed it out to a fellow co-worker who seemed to think it was some kind of star.  He proceeded to leave for the night.   Just before finishing my cigarette while continuing to watch it, the object flashed a bright white light and disappeared.  The light did not flash on the ground.  There was no sound associated with it.;42.8252000000001;-86.0105999999999
