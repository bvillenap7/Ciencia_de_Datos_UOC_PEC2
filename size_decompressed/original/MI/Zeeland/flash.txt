A sudden bright light rayed through my window.  My brother and I both noticed it. It was slightly larger than the moon, but glowed more violently.  Very slowly, it moved across the sky for a brief four seconds, then zoomed to the right very quickly. I was expecting it to appear after ducking behind the trees in my backyard, but didn't.  It was like it suddenly vanished!   I'm now hearing some rather strange sounds, like a vibration of a nearby train.  I checked but didn't hear any train horns or rumbling tracks.  A slight hum can be heard, too.. I hope this is helpful.;42.8252000000001;-86.0105999999999
