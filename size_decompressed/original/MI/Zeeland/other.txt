PD));2019-12-22 19:25:00;19:35;It was around 7:25pm on December 22, 2019 that we were driving the family home down the I-196 (west). We were coming from Grandville, Michigan heading towards Holland and were about a mile or two from the exit 55 towards Zeeland/Holland and US-31. As we were driving I saw 7 white lights that looked like they were lower than the majority of the stars in the sky. They we’re all in a row and we’re all evenly spaced. They weren’t low enough to see any detail in their shape but the constant pattern and equal spacing intrigued me. It reminded me of the airport when the planes lined up to land.  As we continued driving some started to disappear and leave a bigger Gap in between the others. At one point if I remember correctly an additional light popped up but it was only for a little bit. So technically there were eight at one time. But for the most part I saw seven. After that I saw the second and third light disappear then return as bright as before. Once we reac! hed exit 55 the last two in the row faded out and by the time we passed the exit there were  only about 1 or 2 faint ones left. I tried to take photos but I was on the highway and it was too dark. At for I thought it was a Star constellation but new once I saw the number of them in a row that it most likely was not. It was very interesting to see.;42.8252000000001;-86.0105999999999
