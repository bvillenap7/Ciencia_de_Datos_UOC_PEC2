Out at Lake Michigan, my ex-boyfriend and I were sitting on the beach when we heard a plane engine from behind us in the sky. We turned around to see a craft flying parallel to the shore, then make a hard 90-degree turn towards the direction of the water. It was relatively silent, but the maneuver we saw it perform caught us off-guard. It then became very silent and sped up to an unnatural speed and flew right across the lake away from us. It cleared the horizon in a second, and it was gone. It was roughly the size of a typical jet plane, but a thin cylindrical body with a pair of straight wings making it into a cross shape. however, on the back portion of the craft was a half-circle wing bisected by the body of the craft. hard to explain, but very strange. I've never seen an aerial craft maneuver that way. Only he and I saw it out at the lake, for we were the only ones out there that day.
