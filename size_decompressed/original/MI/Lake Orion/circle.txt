09/17/03  22:00 Michigan USA Lake Orion;2003-09-17 22:00:00;not sure;09/17/03  22:00 Michigan USA Lake Orion My Husband noticed the object first. He happened to look out the window while he was sitting down using the bathroom. It was a very clear night out. He noticed an object that seemed brighter than all the other stars. Then he called me to look at it. The object didn't move like an airplane it actually stood still but we found it was moving slowy away from it's original spot. We decided to look further at this object so we got out some binoculars and went out into our backyard. The object seemed to be round but with other round objects like colored lights or something  but moving around it.The object seemed to be one whole object. They are hard to describe I'm not sure if they were lights or what but they did not seem solid...At first we thought it was a radio tower light...but then the object appeared to be moving slowly...The lights were different colors blues, greens, and reds, so I thought it was weird and may not be a planet or something. The other object was like the colored object except it was all white and very bright. The white object we saw later after we decided to drive by the lake and take a better look at the colored object. We were ready for bed before this all happened but we really felt we needed to take a closer look at these objects they were strange and we normally don't do this sort of  thing...My husband had seen something strange before while hunting a long time ago but I've never seen anything I couldn't explain. We've decided to maybe purchase a telescope to look around and see what else is out there.

object in sky with bright light;2003-09-24 22:30:00;30seconds;object in sky with bright light driving in the rain going up to a stop sign when a bright light caught our eyes, the circular object was flying low and slow with the brightest light we've ever seen! when it was flying over the car we could see red lights on the sides. we shut off the radio and turned the window down there was no sound. we tried to turn around and follow it but there were too many cars stopped on the road, and the object took off too fast to follow. 2 minutes later at our house we were watching out the door talking about what we had just seen and a fighter jet flew just over the house shaking everything going in the same direction we saw the object.;42.7552261538461;-83.2738461538461
Blue white light travelling slowly in north east direction over rural Lake Orion, Michigan.;2008-09-23 23:00:00;1 min;Blue white light travelling slowly in north east direction over rural Lake Orion, Michigan. A blue white light travelling ne lower than normal passenger aircraft fly. Event lasted less than one minute. Flew in a straight ne line and then disappeared. No sound was heard, leading me to disregard as an aircraft. No other lights were visable, flashing or otherwise, such as on an aircraft. Just a solid blue white light. It travelled past a tall tree after which I lost sight of it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides only e-address.  PD));42.7552261538461;-83.2738461538461
Circular object flashing red and green, mimicking a star.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star??  PD));2016-09-03 00:00:00;20 minutes;Circular object flashing red and green, mimicking a star I'm laying in bed and I glance out my window to see what I thought was a star. As I look longer, however, I notice the star is flashing green and red.  It hasn't moved in the past 20 minutes, as I've been watching it, and is just as bright as when I first noticed it. It is circular in shape, mimicking a star, but I've never seen a star that twinkles with alternating colors of red and green. Very strange. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star??

Glowing object that seemed to follow me.;2020-02-20 20:00:00;60 minutes;glowing object that seemed to follow me noticed a bright glowing object hovering just above the tree lines. no sound.  there were planes in the area that were flying higher than the object and were easily distinguishable as planes.  got home and from my backyard could see if hovering in the distance.  just far enough away where i couldn't get a close up video of it. didn't think anything of it, but i had to go back out to the store which is couple blocks over.  as i drove to the store it seemed to be following me.  again thought i was crazy.  finished shopping and when i go out it was still there. i drove home but took a little longer of a route, as i drove it stayed right with me out side my driver window. i was traveling about 45 - 50 mph. i turned into the sub and again it followed my path. i pulled in the garage and went back outside to see if it was there.  again i could see it hovering pretty much in line with my house. i had enough. i went inside and randomly checked if it was there. it remained there for about 30 min after everything happened.  let the dogs out a little later and did not see the object anywhere.;42.7552261538461;-83.2738461538461
