Cigar Shaped Craft seen in Detroit, Michigan;2017-12-19 02:30:00;30-minutes;Cigar Shaped Craft seen in Detroit, Michigan I were walking my dog when I heard the sound of a distant fan or water trickling through a fan.  It was a different sound than we had heard before but I was concerned due to the extreme ice we have had that someones gas line or something similar may have broken. As I stopped to figure out where the sound could be coming from I realized the sound was coming from above. I looked up, to my shock a large cigar shaped craft pitch black was moving through the sky in and out of the overcast clouds.  I would say maybe 5 or 6 football fields in length. It slowly moved west to east towards Detroit.  I ran home as quickly as I could to get my phone.  Rushing out to take a picture to my dismay it was gone. This was clearly much larger than any hot air balloon I have ever seen, and due to the temperature in the low 30's with wind gusts upwards of 10-20 mph I find it unlikely this massive object was Hindenburg which it would have to have been.  I am extremely angry! that I did not have my phone on me but who ever has anything like this occur.;42.7552261538461;-83.2738461538461
