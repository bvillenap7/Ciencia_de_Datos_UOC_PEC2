Balloon shaped clear bubble with what appeared to be fire inside moving over the lake;2010-06-26 22:00:00;90 seconds;Balloon shaped clear bubble with what appeared to be fire inside moving over the lake On our lake we saw an orange light moving toward us, we first thought it was a plane, but it was much lower and orange.  We looked through binoculars and saw what looked like a balloon shaped clear bubble with what appeared to be fire inside.  It was low in the sky at first, moving slowly across the lake above us, then it began gaining altitude and disappeared.  We have no idea what it was, my husband and I both viewed it through the binoculars and neither of us could come up with an explanation.
