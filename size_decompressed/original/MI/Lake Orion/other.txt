At 10:20 pm EST I stepped out of my house to head to the pharmacy.  I looked up at the stars as I normally do at night and noticed a foot-wide beam of what appeared to be dim light shining across the sky.  I traced this beam to the moon where it seems to originate from.  There was a cloud around the moon, normal enough, but when this beam passed into the cloud, it had changed color.  When the beam shone across the moon-lit cloud it turned to a black color, almost as if the light had turned to shadow. The beam ran from the moon off into the horizon, towards the constellations of the Little and Big Dipper, Ursa Minor and Major.  After watching this beam for approximately 10 minuets it, for lack of a better term, pinched off at the moon and and began to disappear from left to right.  I know this sounds crazy and isn't exactly a UFO, but this is the only site I know of where I can get some confirmation what did I see?  Did anyone else see what I did?

15-20 Star looking Objects that we’re NOT stars.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-19 00:00:00;25;15-20 Star looking Objects that we’re NOT stars. I was taking my dog on a walk and as I was walking right past Long Lake in Lake Orion Michigan. I noticed a bunch of flying objects all in sync with each other coming from the middle of the lake going north.  Every time one would disappear to the northside one more would appear above the middle of the Lake. It was/is a very clear sky out and you could see every single star so I know it wasn’t any stars.  There has been a planet out lately that you can see that is the brightest star in the sky and it wasn’t that at all.  I kept looking to see where they were appearing from all of these star looking objects and they just kept appearing out of literally nothing. Just out of the middle of nowhere they just kept appearing and none of the stars around it were moving or anything except these UFO objects.  That were all in sink moving with each other one right after another  After about 10 minutes of standing there next to the lake at the boat launch I decided to start walking back home because I was getting scared. I wasn’t sure what was going to happen.  Every so often I would look up in the star sky and it was still there happening every single time and then probably about 15 minutes later I got home and I could still see the UFO lights looking things doing the same thing over and over again.  I came in the house and got my Dad to come out and see them and we walked outside and they were gone.;42.7552261538461;-83.2738461538461
