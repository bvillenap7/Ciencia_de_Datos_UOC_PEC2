ALBION,MI 1-29-12 ON 1/29/12 AT AROUND MIDNIGHT ME AND 2 OTHER PEOPLE WITNESSED THE MOST AMAZING THING WE HAVE EVER SEEN IN OUR LIVES!   WE SEE STRANGE ORANGE LIGHTS IN THE SKY BY MY HOUSE ALMOST EVERY NIGHT SO AT FIRST WE  JUST THOUGHT IT WAS THE SAME THING WE SEE ALL THE TIME BUT WE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE  WRONG!  IT APPEARED IN THE EAST SKY AND SLOWLY MOVED UPWARD,  WE COULD SEE IT MOVE BEHIND TREE  LIMBS AND APPEAR AGAIN WITH OUT US MOVING OUR EYES... AS WE WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT AN  HOUR I NOTICED THAT IT WAS NOT WHAT WE SEE ALL THE TIME BUT SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT!  WHEN I FINALLY GOT MY CAMERA AND TRIPOD SET UP AND STARTED TO FILM IT I WAS BLOWN AWAY  AND TOTALLY SHOCKED AND AMAZED AT WHAT I SEEN THROUGH MY VIEWFINDER!  WELL WHY DON'T YOU JUST TAKE A LOOK FOR YOURSELF... VIDEO LINK 1 (ORIGINAL FOOTAGE):   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qImER_1ubGE   VIDEO LINK 2  (ORIGINAL FOOTAGE CLEANED UP WITH A SHARPENING FILTER THROUGH ADOBE  PREMIERE PRO 4.0)   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-snGmKM5s0   AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS NOT ANYTHING THAT I CAN EXPLAIN AND HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS  COULD BE!  WE WENT INSIDE TO UPLOAD THE FOOTAGE ONTO MY YOUTUBE PAGE AND BECAUSE WE  WERE FREEZING AND NEEDED TO WARM UP BUT WHEN WE CAME BACK OUT SIDE IT WAS COMPLETELY  GONE. WELL THAT'S ALL I CAN SHOW YOU OR TELL YOU AS THIS IS ALL THE INFO I HAVE ON WHAT WE  WITNESSED AND FILMED. THANK YOU!;42.2593;-84.7656
