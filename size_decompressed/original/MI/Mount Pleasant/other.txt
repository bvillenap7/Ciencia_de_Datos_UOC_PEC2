5 parallelogram shaped lights in tight formation at high speed observed over  Mid-Michigan;2007-11-28 00:03:00;1 minute;5 parallelogram shaped lights in tight formation at high speed observed over  Mid-Michigan While sitting in our hot tub, identifying constellations, 5 lights in tight formation appeared high above.  They were parallelogram in shape and one was not quite as clear as the others. They traveled at a high speed SE to NW.  First they were went straight then near the end moved in an erratic motion while maintaining tight formation.  I lost them in the trees (leafless) and distance.  Just as they were going out of view, a shooting star passed behind them from SSW to NNE giving me a contrast between the two sights.  While in awe watching the objects, I had the presence of mind to quickly review the constellations I was observing just prior as a sanity or presence of mind check.  As a side note, I am an ex-pilot and ex-Air Traffic Controller.  These objects were not flying in any form we know.;43.6053692142089;-84.7798015069969
