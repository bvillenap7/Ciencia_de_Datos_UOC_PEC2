Very large black triangle with red and white lights at night, seen again in morning with blue and white lights.;2007-12-05 22:51:00;2 minutes;Very large black triangle with red and white lights at night, seen again in morning with blue and white lights. I was on my way to work heading north on US-127. I had just passed the Business 127 exit and noticed a formation of planes ahead that seemed to come out of no where. As I got closer to it, I slowed down and rolled my window down. The formation was also heading north just parallel to the Interstate.  The formation of planes appeared to be flying very slow. Still heading north on US-127 and just past Broomfield Road, I went directly under it. It was not a formation of planes. It was a very large black triangle. I actually saw the shape and texture of it. It was about the size of a football field or bigger. It was approximately 400-600 feet off the ground. It made no sound that I could hear.  It had faint white lights on each corner as well as brighter red lights on each corner. The red light at the front of it was flashing as if a Strobe light in a weird sequence of blinks. Almost like Morse code.  When I got out of work in the morning, it was beginning to get light out. I remembered the exact location that I saw the object the previous night. Lo and behold, there was something in the sky at the exact location. This time it was much higher. It was barely moving.  It was hard to tell the shape of it. It had faint blue lights, and three very bright white lights. The middle white light was flashing just as the red light did the night before. It made no sound that I could hear.;43.6053692142089;-84.7798015069969
Five yellow/orange lights, no sound traveling east.;2012-12-22 20:15:00;5 minutes;Five yellow/orange lights, no sound traveling east. Saw three yellow lights in a triangle formation below the clouds, no sound at all.  They were traveling west to east and disappeared but were then followed  by two more lights in single formation.  We were not the only ones to see them as we were driving and other cars pulled over to watch. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
