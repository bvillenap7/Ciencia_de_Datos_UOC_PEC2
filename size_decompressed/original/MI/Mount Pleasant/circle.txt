2 red objects moving across the sky of Mount Pleasant Michigan;2011-07-05 00:00:00;5 Minutes;2 red objects moving across the sky of Mount Pleasant Michigan On the night of July 4th, 2011, at about Midnight, I had just completed about a 45 minute jog.  I proceeded to sit down on my porch to relax for a minute when i noticed a bright cicular object moving slowly across the skyline.   The object when I first noticed it was to my east, moving to the South with maybe just a slight Westward inclination.   After watching it for maybe a minute or so, it dawned on me that I should grab my binoculars to see exactly what it was.  I ran into the house grabbed my hunting case and the binoculars were not there.  I searched around the house for probably another minute or so and then gave up.   I went back outside and the object was still there but further away to the south.  I watched it for possibley another minute or two and then it blinked on and off about 3 maybe 4 times then just simply disapeared.   After a moment i went in the house still trying to find my binoculars.  After a short search to no avail, I stepped back on my porch and there was another object exactly like the first one traveling the exact same path as the first.  I watched it for probably 3 minutes or so and then it dissapeared too.   Both objects seemed to follow static lines across the sky, neither going up or down. I would describe them as round perhaps 4 to 5x as bright as the brightest star, red in color with perhaps a shade of gold or oranges tint toward the center.   I am not sure which direction the wind was from that night but it was negligable. My first thought was that they were some kind of Firework, but to my knowledge nothing is going to stay in the air for that long and move in such an exact manner. ((NUFORC Note:  Date above has been corrected.  We believe that the sighting occurred just after midnight, on the morning of July 5th, 2011.  PD));43.6053692142089;-84.7798015069969
8 Bright Orange lights seen just north of mount pleasant, mi;2012-04-07 21:00:00;? - drove by;8 Bright Orange lights seen just north of mount pleasant, mi Driving north to Clare, From mount pleasant michigan.  Left the business drive(mission st) and got on the express way headed north to Clare , MI Just onto the expressway I noticed about 8 bright orange glowing lights, looked like radio tower lights.  Very bright(not blinding or had to squint) but brighter than stars.  Thought at first it was like a tower or something , but then i thought, no way....no towers here, just slightly north of mount pleasant, where no buildings are and the lights were spanned to long and far apart to be a tower of some sort.  This is when i pointed it out to my family of 5 in the car with me (even drove back the next day to make sure, and nothing was there)  Lights seemed relatively low, as about 2 -3 miles ahead, we could no longer see them.  Lights were very orange, no changing colors, did not move at all, looked very evenly spaced, not one on top of another, but started low and then inclementedly climbed, then 3 evened out(straight/level), then started to inclement back up higher.  Extremely similair to these pictures:   http://lightsinthetexassky.blogspot.com/2010/06/orange-lights-over-prince-william.html   http://www.sott.net/articles/show/185971-Mysterious-orange-UFOs-swoop-across-Britain-s-and-Holland-s-skies   http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&hl=en&sa=N&biw=1920&bih=899&tbm=isch&tbnid=pjwVrni97mIkTM:&imgrefurl=http://paranormalspy.com/news/ufo-sighting-as-public-reports-50-lights-in-sky.html&docid=RhSI97BrfVwC1M&imgurl=http://paranormalspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/brit_ufo_6-3.jpg&w=468&h=468&ei=th2CT6GsC-PX0QHY84nvBw&zoom=1&iact=rc&dur=0&sig=118076052259284524904&page=1&tbnh=108&tbnw=108&start=0&ndsp=50&ved=1t:429,r:2,s:0,i:88&tx=60&ty=70     Researched online to see if anything else was posted, seen alot of people over seas talking about how these are the chinease lanterns, and they might have been.  However, they just seemed to bright and still to be these, and the top ones were very high in the sky.  Still way to orange of a color and way to bright/large, to be chinease lights/lanterns i feel. Unfortuneatly i did not take a picture because i was in awe and just happened so fast and i did not want to look away.
