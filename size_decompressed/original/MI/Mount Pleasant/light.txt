Bright amber light gently zig-zags downward and ball of light outside of my home.;2002-09-04 23:45:00;2-3 seconds;Bright amber light gently zig-zags downward and ball of light outside of my home. A bright amber/white light, at least twice as bright as the brightest star, appeared almost due west from my position, 45 degrees above the horizon, and fell slowly downward, disappearing approximately 15 degrees above the horizon.  The light's path seemed to gently zig-zag (could be attributed to autokenesis or tired eyes while night driving). I was travelling westbound on M-20, approximately five miles east of MT Pleasant, MI, when this light appeared directly ahead of my position at approximately 11:45 pm.  It was extremely bright and compared to meteors, moved very slowly. Could this have been space debris, a bollide or something more anomalous? At approximately 12:30am, forty-five minutes following the sighting, I witnessed a bright flash of light in my upstairs hallway window.  I turned to see a ball of light passing the window and lighting up the hallway.  My five year old cat responded to this by quickly running up to the wall next to the window and staring intently at a point seven feet up and growling.  It took a full ten minutes for him to calm down.;43.6053692142089;-84.7798015069969
What appeared to be a start in the Western sky moved at an impressive rate and then stopped.;2004-07-25 11:00:00;3 minutes;What appeared to be a start in the Western sky moved at an impressive rate and then stopped. I saw what I first thought to be a star in the Western sky.  If the North star is 0/360 degrees, the event occured at approximately 265 degrees, at approximately the same hight as the North star.  It was very small and appeared to be very far away.  I could make out no shape, as it appeared simply as a speck of light.  The object then proceeded to move North across sky at what appeared to be a very impressive rate.  The object then stoped in the sky.  At this point I watched the object for a period of 5 minutes, in which it did not move.;43.6053692142089;-84.7798015069969
Light intensifies to shine on me.;2006-06-18 00:00:00;30 sec;Light intensifies to shine on me. Weather conditions: Clear sky stars out.  First sight 11:56 PM on 6-17-2006: Aircraft flying East to West at a high altitude high rate of speed faster than the commercial airlines that go over more like the military jets that go over. Flashing strobes white and red.  Second sight 11:59 PM on 6-17-2006: Noticed a light in the sky that was very similar to a satellite gliding South to North what appeared to be slightly slower than the first object but at a higher altitude. The object appeared to have a steady white light on just gliding through the air. (I like watching the satellites for some strange reason as we get allot of them gliding over our house and we are in the middle of the country.) The best way to describe the light and what it did is to imagine a light bulb 65 watts in the distance just floating through the air. A faint light. Then imagine that light bulb turning and rotating towards you and when it was pointed directly at you it was like a spot light like on a police car. The light was super bright and remained on me for maybe 2 sec. then what appeared to be rotation back down and then very quickly matter of 3 to 4 sec. fade to nothing. I stood there and though that maybe there was a cloud that I couldn’t see and wanted to see it again but it was gone. The sky was still clear I then went inside and told my wife about it and she said that I was nuts. Lol  Let me know if anyone else has seen something like this. Or what you think it was.

Not one, but TWO, UFO's spotted in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan on Feb. 4, 2012;2012-02-04 15:10:00;15 minutes;Not one, but TWO UFO's spotted in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan on Feb. 4, 2012 Went out on my front porch to have a cigarette and a really bright light in the sky caught my attention. I looked at it, and the lights were sporadic and bright, but I noticed it wasn't moving and remained stationary for quite a bit...maybe 10 minutes.  I had my fiancee come out and look, and my son noticed it as well.  To me, it looked to be triangle shaped, but my fiancee said that he thought it was changing shapes.  Not long after spotting this one, a long cigar shaped like craft was flying up and towards the south east.  It seemed pretty close to the earth, we could see it fully with our bare eyes, it made absolutely no sound and it flew out of sight range.  The first craft was still in the same spot. After about 10 minutes it slowly started going up further into the sky, but still flashing.  Then it picked up speed though still extremely slow it started flying east, until it wasn't able to be seen anymore.  I wonder how many others in the area may have seen i! t...;43.6053692142089;-84.7798015069969
Steady paced but slow-bobbing light, that takes shooting off into the night within seconds.;2014-08-20 00:00:00;~1 minute;Steady paced but slow-bobbing light, that takes shooting off into the night within seconds. I was at my friend's house.  We usually go out to the casino or out downtown, but we both decided to stay in.  My friend and I were hanging out, when she remembered that she had leftover fireworks.  We went outside to set them off.  Some sparklers, some snakes, and some helicopter fireworks that go shooting up a little over 6 feet.  We did the snakes and sparklers, ending with the helicoptors.  The first one had went up on the roof, so we waited for it to fall back down.  We lit off a few more and watched where each one went to make sure it didn't get stuck somewhere. We got down to the last helicopter, and after it had fallen, we both turned away from the house and for some reason, we looked up.  We froze there for what felt like 10 minutes.  There was a light that was bobbing up and down, slowly moving in the sky.  The bobbing motion was not too slow, but it wasn't very speedy.  The bobbing lasted for a couple seconds until I asked my friend if she was seeing it, too.  She said she saw it, and all of a sudden it shot right off.   We tried to follow it, but it just kind of disappeared into the darkness of the night.  I felt a very heavy feeling, and we both started freaking out and went back inside.

((HOAX??))  I was taken to an alien laboratory from my bedroom.;2015-06-05 03:00:00;Unknown - a few hours?;I was taken to an alien laboratory from my bedroom. ((NUFORC Note:  We have tried to contact the source of the report, principally to inquire whether the report is a sincere one, or whether it might be a hoax.  PD)) Last Thursday night, I was sleeping at home, when I woke up with the feeling that somebody was breaking in my house.  I went to have a look, and as I went to get up out of bed, I found myself paralyzed in place.  I felt really scared, like I was having a nightmare or something.  When I tried to close my eyes, I couldn’t close them, and I looked around up in the air, I assumed myself to be in a dream, but I couldn’t wake up, so I started scream, and before I could get a sound out in a single second, I was floating above my bed and I felt a deep very low frequency hum like a large transformer was inside my body.  Then I could see behind me back at my bed, and my cat, who sleeps by me, didn’t even seem to care or notice that I wasn’t in my bed anymore.  I was absolutely terrified and right, as I was about to scream, I started floating toward my wall of my bedroom. To my shock, I went right thru the wall, like I was a ghost or the wall was liquid, and as I saw thru my wall, I was feeling this vibration intensify greatly, like a force of my body was going to explode from inside out.  I passed out completely, and when I remember waking up, I realized that I was in some type of white science looking laboratory room of some sort.  I again, assumed I was dreaming, until I saw a face looking down at me.  It was a large head, with black bug-like eyes, and in my head as I went to scream, I heard it say don’t be afraid of me, you are safe with me.  I don’t know how to explain it, but it said it thru my brain, like a mind reader would read your mind.  The voice sounded like I was saying it to myself, instantaneously to myself. Then I went to ask, what’s going on, and before I could talk, again it said don’t worry, and said we’re zeta brothers.  I didn’t really understand what that means, but as I could see more clearly, I immediately noticed, that the! se weren’t people at all, it was an oblong looking bug eyed grey skinned, probably around 3 feet tall, with a silver suit made of some kind of spandex.  It had a tiny little slit where the mouth was, and just holes for ears.  It's head was wobbling on what I remember thinking was a tiny neck right in the middle, and it's hands looked like they were really skinny and long, with almost no texture, just like the texture of the lining of a hot dog casing.  This thing that I can only explain look wise, as an alien creature. When I asked it to go home, another one came in the room, and they were talking to each other without talking, and one said, something in a weird sounding almost African type of language, and they came back next to me but in an instant, no walking, just teleporting back to above me, and the other of the two took off my pants, and put a strange circular light orb on my genitals, and it was very painful.  I immediately felt as though I was being burned on my penis, and it then took the ball off me, and the pain instantly stopped. Then the one holding the light ball disappeared in a flash out of my view, and the other above me said I want to show you him, and a different taller bright white one of these things came out walking with what looked like a little girl, but with some of the facial features of these creatures, and it looked up at me and said “you know who I am”, This scared me terribly and immediately I remember falling back asleep. When I woke up again, it was the next morning and I was back lying in my bed, without my covers being disturbed, and immediately assumed it was very scary nightmare.  Then, I when I went to get out of bed, my ankle felt as though the same vibrational burning sensation was coming from under my skin by my bone in my leg, so I looked down, and noticed that there is a small maybe 1/8th of an inch circular cut out and burned mark on my leg, but it goes down like 4 layers of my skin, as if someone had literally punched a hole with a paper punch out of it, and then burned it closed.   For the past few days, I haven’t really been able to tell if this was a dream, or real, but strange feelings happen to my leg and I hear weird static sounds in my head when I feel it.  I keep also, seeing a strange pattern of a triangle, with two circles in it, which looks like some sort of geometric constellation when I start to fall asleep every night since.  I don’t know still if I was just dreaming of this, or if it really happened, but I can't explain why I am still feeling and seeing weird things, or the hole on my leg I found the morning after this all happened.;43.6053692142089;-84.7798015069969
