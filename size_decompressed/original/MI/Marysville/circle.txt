I was riding my bike at night and saw these orange orbs, about 3 to 4 foot diameter. I know EXACTLY what they are.;42.9094;-82.4716
I saw a (what looked like a star) white circle in the sky shining very very bright (compare to Jupiter on a summer night).;2017-05-27 09:00:00;25-30 minutes;Started out my mom, dad, and I were sitting around the bonfire in our backyard. I was looking west and my dad was seated looking northwest.  I saw a (what looked like a star) white circle in the sky shining very very bright (compare to Jupiter on a summer night) and about 5-6 minutes later a passenger jet (delta) flew under the orb and proceeded to go as usual north. 30 seconds later two unidentified black what appeared to be fighter jets flew towards the light and as i looked at my dad he started to become alarmed as to what they were doing following a jet.   Well as the fighter jets aproached the light, the light disappeared for about 2-3 minutes. Enough time for my dad to jump up and for me to grab the binoculars from the house.  Came back out and the light appeared again but this time going exceptionally fast South (toward the canadian border) and was gone.  As i set my phone down to grab binoculars again to see, my phone opened up google and began recording! what we were saying.  I swear to god as my witness I NEVER touched my cellphone to open up google.  Never said okay google nothing.  I screenshotted what was on my screen and made sure the video of the incident was saved.  My neighbors about 45 minutes ago messaged me and stated that they could see what appeared to be the northern lights which is very very odd considering we are smothered with light pollution from Canadas Chemical Valley.   We went outside and only saw a streak about in the same area as the jets were headed and going north east to west.  Had a greenish tint to it but nothing extremely noticible to the naked eye.  On the way in I looked north and saw what i imagine to be a jet following a solid white light proceeding east to Canada (at this time its about midnight).  Very unusual and creepy night here.  At this time i am very shooken up and quite frankly startled about what we saw and my father is as well.;42.9094;-82.4716
