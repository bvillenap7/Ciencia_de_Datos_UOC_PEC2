Metallic disc observed from Hamtramck, MI between contrails.;2008-04-27 14:00:00;20 Minutes;Metallic disc observed from Hamtramck, MI between contrails. My family and I (Matthew) were outside on this clear afternoon holding our annual yard sale. We were looking at the contrails from a fighter jet returning to Selfridge Air Force Base when my mother and I both noticed a bright silver ball moving erratically across the sky between the contrails. It was very distant, but we could tell that it was metallic by its sheen. My father had trouble spotting it, but eventually, we were able to pinpoint its location for him. My sister ran inside the house to grab my binoculars. It took me about 5 minutes to get a lock on the object because of its extremely fast movements. I was able to tell that the object was disc shaped and did not have any markings on it whatsoever. After about 10 more minutes of watching in awe, we were forced to look away to assist some customers. When we were ready to continue watching the spectacle, the object was no where to be seen. We scanned the skies for an hour or so afterward in hopes of seeing the object again. My father is a strong disbeliever in UFOs, but even he was baffled by what we saw. I am an avid researcher into the paranormal, but I was hesitant to make any quick conclusions about the object's nature.;42.4122;-83.0547
