But it was odd because it was mostly cloudy out that night so i just kept watching the object as i was driving.  It kept coming closer to the ground so i thought maybe a meteor had came into the atmosphere because it was glowing a yellow-orange color and you could see a trail of light behind it as well.  Then, for a moment i passed some near by trees and houses so i lost sight of it for a couple of seconds.  After i regained sight of it however it was no longer a bright light in the sky. i could only see the side at this point and it looked like some small aircraft maybe the height of a helicopter.  But i knew it wasn't a helicopter after it passed the road down maybe half a mile away from where i was still driving.  I could see the back of it after it crossed and at that point i saw the object had no wings and i could hear nothing coming from the object.  And these little dim lights completely went around the circumference of it and on the back, there were two bright lights in the shape of a square that little up for only a brief second.  I've never been one to believe 100% in things like this but after what i saw that night, there's no doubt that at least there is mysterious aircraft that are nothing like what we fly in today.;42.6426;-84.5221
