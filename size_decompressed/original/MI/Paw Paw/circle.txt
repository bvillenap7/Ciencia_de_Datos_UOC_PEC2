3 circle objects appear over town;2009-09-11 20:00:00;15 mins;3 circle objects appear over town     The first one appeared prior to the fireworkss display. The air space in the area was restricted due to the fireworks display, and they were high enough up to not be affected by the fireworks. Then the other two followed the exact same path as the first. They were flashing colored lights, so it was definitely no plane. There was no unusual noise made by them.. here are the videos of the UFO's http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEnmdRHv5EY http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQFaAMYOACc http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg5pab_MNt4 ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.
