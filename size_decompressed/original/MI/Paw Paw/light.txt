Two Brite red lights.;2015-06-29 00:15:00;10;Two Brite red lights. I seen two bright red lights in the sky in waverly township.  They stayed red for at least three minutes then disappeared only to do the same about three to four times before finally disappearing.  The duration was about 10-15 minutes long.   I could tell the we're fairly close maybe about a couple feilds away from my home.  Just before disappearing it seamed the last time they blinked on they were a little more west than before.   I first noticed them out my back window then my son and I went outside and stood on the table to see them.  They were too low to the ground to be a plane that's for sure.;42.2349;-85.9005
Orange lights sighted over Paw Paw, Michigan 3/12/17;2017-03-12 19:30:00;4 minutes;Orange lights sighted over Paw Paw, Michigan 3/12/17 UFO report for 3/12/17, Paw Paw, Michigan  My wife and I were leaving her fathers house about 7:25 PM (high clouds, no stars observed)  I noticed a relatively bright orange light in the sky.  It had no strobe visual, but it appeared to flicker some.  I could hear no sound from it, and it was not moving significantly laterally, but it did appear to move closer to my location and then up before blinking out.   I stopped the car and got out.  I began taking a video with my cell phone of the object which began to blink out.  Then my wife said there were two more.  I continued taking video, I thought.  I then realized I had not hit the record button and immediatley did so to just catch the end of the two lights as they blinked out. I looked at the area I thought they were over on Google Maps and it appears to be mostly wetlands.  I thought they may be luminaries or drones, but not sure.  They were high enough that luminaries would have been moving laterally with the wind at that altitude.  Not sure what drones would have been doing out after dark, and why did they appear to rise at the end and then blink out.  Not saying I know what they were, but I could come up with no explaination.;42.2349;-85.9005
