I got a clear view of the craft, I know what I saw. Heading Northbound on I-75 off of Rockwood exit, 27, I pointed to something in the sky and said, What is that!?   In the same direction I pointed, was a water tower.   My Dad responded, That is a water tower, son.  That is not what I was pointing at.  There was a blue light flying towards us at a remarkable speed.   As this object became closer, I realized it was not a light.  I got a very clear view as the object passed our car.  It was a vibrant sky blue and it appeared to be almost glowing.  It was clearly in the shape of a disk or saucer.  It appeared to have black lines running perpendicular to each other around the craft.  It was traveling at a remarkable speed, quite low in the sky.   It was a clear night, and my eyes did not deceive me.  I saw a blue, flying saucer.  Maybe it was government technology? Or extraterrestrial?   My Dad, who does not fully believe in flying saucers, caught a glimpse.  He was quite shocked.  He is 58. This is my second UFO encounter. I am 22 years old and I educate myself on UFO phenomena often. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Mr Davenport,  I apologize, I see I put the date as 8-19-2013, not sure how I made that mistake.  I saw this Sunday night, 2-24-2013, at exactly 8:19 pm. I will ask my Dad if he would be willing to write a report! Sorry for the confusion,;42.0694;-83.2149
