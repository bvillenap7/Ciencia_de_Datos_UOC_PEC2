Green sky's and strange unatural cloud activity  followed by sudden lights;1995-06-30 22:00:00;45 minutes;Green sky's and strange unatural cloud activity  followed by sudden lights In Southeast Michigan you don't see norther lights.  We walked out onto the porch, saw the horizon turning a glowing green.   It continued to grow more green in color, and on a perfectly clear night, ball shaped clouds appeard and began to move in an S pattern through the sky, tens of these appeared and continued to move through the sky and eventually disipate.  Then, the outline of diamonds appeared, and they would expand through the sky and each eventually disipate (appeared to be cloudy material too).  After about 30 minutes of watching this in awe, two large lights, opened up side by side, and one small light appeared between them.  The small light dropped earthward, and then back up again, then the two lights disappeared.  All the activity then started to fade, but continued for at least another 30 minutes.  I've been wondering to this day, what exactly we saw.  It was actually quite terrifying at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));42.0694;-83.2149
