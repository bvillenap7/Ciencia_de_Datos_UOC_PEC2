followed by a circular disc shaped object down road in the after noon;1974-08-15 17:00:00;15;followed by a circular disc shaped object down road in the after noon I was only 15 maybe 16 when this happened and my youngest brother and my mom were on our way to Bloomingdale to a friends house to watch this program we all watched on Saturdays together.  We were headed down 109th ave. to get there and were only about a mile and a half from our place when my brother noticed something in the air above us and to the left of the road.  It was stationary for a short while and then seemed to follow us if mom speeded up it did when she slowed down it did.  It followed us for about 2 or 3 miles down the road. It seemed sort of metallic and seemed to reflect the after noon setting suns colors of a light to dark burnt orange colors, and was circular or round in shape.  It most definitely was not a balloon there was no basket under it and what we could see from a side angle it was more of a disc.  Other then our friends we never discussed or reported it to any authorities .  After following us for a while it suddenly shot straight up and disappeared.  We checked around and nothing was in the news about it so that only reinforced our resolve to not report it.  Most people would have laughed and teased us about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is flawed.  We assume a sighting in 1974, and we have amended the date above to reflect that assumption.  PD));42.4651;-86.0762
