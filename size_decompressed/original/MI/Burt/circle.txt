A silent circular craft with lights on the side and three on the bottom as in a triangle.;1978-10-03 18:00:00;3 minutes;A silent circular craft with lights on the side and three on the bottom as in a triangle. Was fairly large moving approximately 60 miles an hour or so it seemed.  It was well above our light pole but looked close to the ground because of the size.  It had lights on the side of the craft with 3 lights on the bottom which appeared to be in a triangle.  The sky was still a little lighted so the figure of the craft showed well.  It moved silently except for the sound of the air being pushed away from the craft.   Once it passed our field it moved over top of the trees in the forest and moved away very rapidly and out of sight.  The time and date is approximate but not exact.   That very night on the evening news, I remember my father stating that there were several phone calls on this sighting.   We lived in Burt, MI, and it traveled right over the top of us and was well seen moving toward the small downtown area as we lived about 2 miles from Burt.
