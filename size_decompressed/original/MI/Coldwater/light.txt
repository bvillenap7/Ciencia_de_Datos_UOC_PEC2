((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax??  PD)) ADDENDUM:  ((NUFORC Note #2:  The witness contacted us, stating that his report was not intended as a hoax.  We apologize if our assessment of the report was flawed.  However, when a report is submitted with spelling errors and grammatical mistakes, it exhibits the same characteristics as those submitted by people hoping to hoax us.  The best way to convince our proofreader as to whether a report is accurate, or not, is to make certain that the prose is grammatically correct, and that the report appears to be the product of someone who is paying attention to detail.

6 red lights following each other, moving quickly.;2014-12-28 21:31:00;10-15 minutes;6 red lights following each other, moving quickly. My mother was laying on the couch, she looked out the window, and noticed a red light moving across the sky.  She got up and went over for a better look, then called me over to the door to look.  Then another one appeared, and another one.  They all followed after eavh other, moving quickly.  Eventually we counted 6, and then we didn't see anymore.  But there could have been more that we didn't see before she noticed the first light.  Our nieghbors also notice dthe lights, and came outside.;41.9290000000001;-85.0026999999999
