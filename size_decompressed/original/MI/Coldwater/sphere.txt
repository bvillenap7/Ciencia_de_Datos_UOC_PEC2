(3) Separate bright reddish spheres seen moving in tandem over Coldwater, Michigan on 08/23/14 by two witnesses.;2014-08-23 22:43:00;90 seconds;(3) Seperate bright reddish spheres seen moving in tandem over Coldwater, Michigan on 08/23/14 by two witnesses. At approx. 2243 hours, while driving north on Division Street about 1 mile south of the town of Coldwater, Michigan, my husband and I saw two bright balls of light.  It was dark out but both the lights were quite brillant and very noticable.  Both were reddish in color and maybe a couple to several hundred feet up in the air moving in tandem across the sky at about the same altitude and speed and at about the same distance apart.  There was no noticable sound, and it was moving to fast to be a set of hot air ballons and too slowly for an airplane either assending or desending.  We could not see wings in the dark showing any type of aircraft.  We could not see any fuselage that was attached to the either of the lights.  And, we don't think it was a helicopter, as we've never seen lights on any aircraft that resembled what we saw.  The lights appeared too far apart to be lights on a big plane.  They were just moving across the sky at about the same spee! d together. We pulled over to the shoulder of the road to watch the two tandem lights moving across the skyline, and a few seconds later, there was another sphere of bright light several hundred feet up moving from the east to the west after the other ones.  This ball of light, was even bigger than the first two, but  was alone and at about the same altitude as the first two spheres.   The third light was also reddish/orange in color very noticeable and not like anything we'd ever seen quite extraordinary and unique.    It moved in the same direction about 10-15 seconds after the first two that were seen in tandem together. We continued to watch as all three light spheres drifted and moved west out of our view of site.   This only lasted about 60-90 seconds total.  The strangest thing was there was no sound to hear, as we rolled down our windows and listened for the sound of some kind of engine roar.;41.9290000000001;-85.0026999999999
