My friends and I were sitting around a campfire. The moon was behind us. I look away from the fire and above us was a silver circle with a white aura surrounding it. There was only one. It was way bigger then any stars. I watched it stay and then zoom across the sky, behind the house. Leaving a trail of siver dust like stuff.;41.9290000000001;-85.0026999999999
