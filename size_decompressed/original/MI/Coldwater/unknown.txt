The craft that I saw 0n the night of 08/28/03 is difficult to describe, since I could not see the fusilage. What I could see was the wing portion of the craft. Each wing starts off straight, but then is bent upwards around the mid-length of the wing and then bent downwards to form two sides of a triangle. The under side of the wings(the part I could see) appeared to have what looked like veins that emmitted a low intencity green light. The light intencity from the craft was not strong enough to overcome the light intencity of our street lights in our parking lot. Using buildings and trees as a heighth and width reference I would say that the craft was flying at 60-100 Ft. off the ground. The wing span I would estimate at being 40-60 Ft. in length. The speed of the craft at about 10 M.P.H. I could not understand how a winged craft moving that slow not only did'nt run into a stall speed problem, but concidering the altitude, that it did not emit any sound.;41.9290000000001;-85.0026999999999
