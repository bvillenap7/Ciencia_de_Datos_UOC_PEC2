On our way home we passed a golf course and a small housing area around the golf course.  We were talking when I suddenly noticed this huge gigantic black craft in the sky. The craft easily covered the entire golf course which it hovered over.  There were greenish/bluish tinted lines in intricate patterns and designs on the bottom of the craft.  It was not only very long and wide it was also quite thick from what I could tell.  The golf course was right by the road, so we were near directly underneath the craft. The craft made no sound and hovered over the golf course motionless.  My mother said she had a sense of fear, I did some but it was more just a fear of the unknown and I was more curious than afraid.  The craft was very low to the ground. My mother and I saw other drivers passing by and slowing down as they did we could see that they could see the craft too. We didnâ€™t stay for long as my mother was scared, sadly we did not have a camera on hand at the time of the sighting.
