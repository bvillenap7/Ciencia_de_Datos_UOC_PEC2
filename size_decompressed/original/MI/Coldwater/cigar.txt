My fiance was in the back yard playing with the dog. I noticed what looked like two airline planes heading right towards eachother. The suspected UFO coming from the East and the plane coming from the West. I called for my finace and told him these two planes look like they are heading right towards eachother. Right when it looked fatal the one coming from the East made a ninty degree shift to the north then proceeded just that quick in the direction it was going previously to the left hand side of the plane. I was astonished. Clearly I am convinced.;41.9290000000001;-85.0026999999999
