A dozen or more non flashing lights disappeared into darkness after flying up in formation one by one, ((Starlink satellites?));2019-12-20 19:45:00;10-15 mins;A dozen or more non flashing lights disappeared into darkness after flying up in formation one by one, stars visible all around. Not sure if it was a military convoy or what but about a dozen or more bright, non flashing lights were seen traveling upwards at a high angle then before even going all the way up, slowly disappeared one by one after reaching certain altitude. No clouds or visibility issues, stars visible behind and all around lights. Odd for them to disappear in such a manner after flying seemingly visibly for thousands of feet upward, in formation one by one. Noticed other flashing passenger aircraft lights very close behind ( ufo being between me and aircraft) this formation as if unaware of their very presence.;41.9604;-85.6407
