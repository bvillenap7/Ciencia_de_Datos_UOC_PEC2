Yellowish/Orange object seen in early 70's SW Michigan.;1973-07-01 23:30:00;15-20 minutes;Yellowish/Orange object seen in early 70's SW Michigan. My friend and I were walking west on a private road, when I noticed a lighted object in the sky to the North approx. 2 miles away.  This object was a dull yellowish/orange in color and was just above treetop level, maybe 100 ft. We both were in awe of this sighting,the objects shape was a parallelogram that tumbled in its movement from west to due east.  We knew from the shape and movement that this was something really different.  As it moved out of our eyesight a motorcycle was heading towards us (we still were walking west)the motorcycle stopped and the rider asked if we had seen what he also witnessed.  It so happens my friend knew this guy and he was really excited(as were we) he was driving home from 3-11 shift and noticed it. He was heading south and  he stopped on the side of the road to watch it.  When it passed over him it caused his motorcycle to stall out.  It made absolutely no sound as it tumbled over him as it moved due east.   Since this happened years ago I wanted it to be known 1 witness besides me still lives in the area (motorcycle rider).   I have 2 other sightings to relate if interested 1 involving light shafts (scanning?) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));41.9604;-85.6407
Hawk like object;2004-11-25 14:00:00;5 minuets;Hawk like object On Thanksgiving day about 2:00 PM I spoted what I thought at firs was a Hwak flying very high. It was very bright white and then I noticed it was flying in a strait line and not flying like a Hawk would. It was also moving faster than a Hawk could fly.  The flight path was North to South. It moved from over head to the horizin in about 5 minuets or less. It made no aound.  The shape looked like a Hawk with it wings spread out.  The sky was blue with snow on the ground.
