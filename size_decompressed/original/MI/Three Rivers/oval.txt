Becouse of the rising sun the jet contrails had a pinkish orangish color to them. I looked lower at the horizon line and I spotted two objects of the same color. At first I only saw the two jet contrails as they head toward the rising sun. They had a pinkish orangish color to them, My wife was driving behind me in our second car. I rolled down my window and pointed out in that direction. As I did I spotted two round star like objects about 10 or 20 degrees above the horizon. They had the same color about them as the jets. I do not belive that these were stars or planets, as we drive this route every day and just about the same time. As soon as I could I pulled over and took some pictures with my digital camera. If you are interested I can send you a copy. I have been an amateur astronomer sin 1970 and I have been interviewed by Linda Moulton Howe.;41.9604;-85.6407
