Wihte light UFO 19;1996-03-21 21:00:00;10-15 minuets;Wihte light UFO 19 in the night of March 21, 1996 about 9:00 pm I saw a white light moving slowly acrros a field. The object made no noise.  I had my Minolta X700 with a 80-210 zoom lens fixed on a tripod. As I paned the object it seemed to be going in a straight line.  I have seen this object befor, but this is the only time I got a photo of it. When the film was processed the object had made arc's seeming to change shape and looked like their might have been more than one object.  I have been an amateur astronomer since the 60's and I have never seen a known aircraft to do this. ((name and location deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have looked at the photos, and all we see is streaks and smears of light.  PD));41.9604;-85.6407
