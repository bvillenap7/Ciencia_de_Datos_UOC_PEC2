Here and Gone;2008-07-23 01:15:00;5-10 Seconds;Here and Gone I was watching the news and heard a loud noise outside. When I looked out the window there was an odd unfamiliar object in the sky. At first I thought it was a helicopter, however when i went to the window to get a better look i realized it wasnt. The lights on the thing were something i had never seen before. It had a white flashing light that chased aroung the outer edge. There was a sollid blue strip that circled the entire craft and two red flashing lights on top. Never have seen anything like this before. Others in the house heard the noise over the night but didnt see anything. I was able to watch it for about 5 seconds or so and the noise was getting louder and all of a sudden it was gone. I went outside to see where it went but there was nothing. Very strange.;43.0560999999999;-83.3374000000002
Illuminating circular obj. whisking through the night sky, changing colors, and disappearing.  ((NUFORC Note:  Satellite?  PD));2010-08-26 00:00:00;3 hours;Illuminating circular object whisking through the night sky, changing colors, and disappearing (only to reappear). It started as us looking for the big dipper (during a camping trip) and we noticed a star brighter than all the other stars but was in too odd of a location to be the North Star.  Then it got smaller, smaller, smaller, and finally disappeared.  It came back, bright as it was before and it started moving in odd motions to distinguish it from a shooting star.   After whisking across the sky it turned red and got very close to the moon.  Soon after that it became its brightest again and it stayed right beneath our sight of the moon for about three hours.  Our cell phones had no service that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Satellite?  PD));43.0560999999999;-83.3374000000002
