((HOAX??  Student report.  PD))  I know I saw a unexplainable object.;2006-07-18 21:30:00;30 seconds;I know I saw a unexplainable object. My friend and I were on our way from my house going to his house last night about 9:30pm. We were heading west on I69, and had just passed the Wilder Road exit, when I saw a object in the sky with 3 lights underneath it. I then said to my friend half jokingly whats that? It hasn't moved in a few seconds, then I realized that it really hadn't, though i was had to tell at first because we were moving.  We got closer and I saw it had three lights under it. I then was serious and said WHAT IS THAT, IT DOESN'T HAVE A JET STREAM!  then as both me and my friend looked at it, we both saw the lights underneath it fade away slowly until they were completely black we both screamed ((obscenity deleted))!, I then said I BELEIVE, I BELEIVE!, and we didnt see it again. I know it was not a plane, helicopter, or anything thing I have ever seen before... I now truely beleiveâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  Probable hoax.  PD));43.0560999999999;-83.3374000000002
Bright orange ball over Lapeer, MI.;2012-08-07 22:00:00;2 minutes;Bright orange ball over Lapeer, MI. I was in my home working on the computer when I heard several sirens coming down the street 1 block north of the house. I went outside to see where they were going and saw 2 fire trucks race past. As I was looking in that direction (north) I saw a bright orange ball about 1/2 mile away with the port and starboard edges appearing to be brighter than the center. I thought it was a little lower than an aircraft should be over town so i ran about 30 ft to my car to retrieve my 7x50 binoculars, as I had been using them earlier to observe boats on the local lake. What i thought was an orange ball was actually 3 glowing orange balls in a triangle shape (2 in front, 1 in the rear) on the bottom of a light colored (silvery) disk shaped craft.  The whole thing was surrounded by a very bright orange halo like a round ball. It was flying due south, about the speed of a normal small plane at about 1000 ft altitude, and flew diectly over me and made absolutly no sound. I estimate it was about 40 or 50 ft in diameter.  It flew about 1/2 mile past sraight and level then began climing at about a 30 degree angle without increasing speed. As it climbed it slowly faded in brightness until I could no longer see it with the binoculars. About 2 minutes later, a helicoter came from north, north/west and flew exactly in the direction of the craft at about the same altitude and speed. I couldn't make out if the helicopter was military or civilian, I will say that helicopters fly in and out of the local prison (1 mile away) and the local hospital (2 miles away) so this may have been unrelated to the craft.  As it was flying a perfect intercept course this would have been quite the coincidence. I wish to remain completely anoymous as there's nothing more I can tell you that isn't contained in this report, except to say that the local prison seems to be a magnet for these things. (Yes, I've seen them before.  They like to hover over the old State Home Cemetery about 200 yds off the east parimeter of the prison at about 1000 ft altitude).
