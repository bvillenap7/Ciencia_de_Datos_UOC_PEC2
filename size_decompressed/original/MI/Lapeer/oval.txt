Huge, cloaked craft seen over unpaved runway at small local airport.;2003-04-18 11:45:00;3 minutes;Huge, cloaked craft seen over unpaved runway at small local airport. I lived out in the country for 3 1/2 years, and was returning home from a Saturday morning shopping excursion.  I took some back roads out of town, one of them running directly along the local airport, Dupont by name.  This is a very small airport, handling only small, private recreational craft.  No jets of any kind, including small Lears can land at this airport.  The runways are too short, for one thing.   As I turned off Roods Lake Road (airport address) east onto Haines Road, a huge shadow passed over my car.  It was so big that I thought, What the hell was that!?  There was no noise.  I drove a few more feet, slowly now, up the road all the way looking to my right.  A line of trees blocked my view for several hundred yards, but when I could see I came to a stop and looked hard.   At first, I didn't see anything, and then, I could.  It was huge and hovering over the short, dirt runway.  It was shaped like (and this is the only  thing I can equate it to) the starship from Star Trek-Enterprise, the one with the lady commander.  Please don't laugh.  I only describe it like that because it's the only correlation I can think of.   The thing that makes it even stranger is that this thing looked 'cloaked.'  By that, I mean you couldn't see it at a glance, but if you stared (like I did), you could see the shape and the size being surrounded by some kind of shiny, reflective shield or something.   I didn't hang around, and no other cars came along, or I might have stopped them, to say, Look!!  I drove my 27 miles north at speeds of 70-80 miles an hour, checking all the way to Clifford, MI., making sure that thing wasn't following me.  I didn't tell anyone about it for weeks.
