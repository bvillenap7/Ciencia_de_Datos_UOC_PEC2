Flew by similar to shooting star only much lower. Two bar lights on either side of object.  Seemed to illuminate bottom just enough to see that it came to a point, much like the bottom of a boat.  Was low to ground, about two hundred feet high.  Flew by a bit slower than a shooting star but stayed bright long enough to get a clear look at it.;43.0560999999999;-83.3374000000002
