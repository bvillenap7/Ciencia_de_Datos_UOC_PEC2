Their was some clouds so I waited to see it again but never saw it again.  Never saw lights like this in the sky.  Did any one else see it ?

We saw a large red light to the left of us.  ((anonymous report));2017-06-12 21:50:00;~90 seconds;We were driving north bound on M24 and just before we were entering into Lapeer before passing the expressway.  We saw a large red light to the left of us.  Some cloud cover but not where this was.  It became slightly longer.  I had to pull over because it was very distracting.  The next time I looked it was 5 or six red and orangeish yellow big lights lights went back into 1.  Bluish purple, then quick red.  Then it was gone. 20 seconds later it was one Big red light [deep bright red not natural looking color, any time I said Red this description applies].  Then nothing[we waited a few minutes].
