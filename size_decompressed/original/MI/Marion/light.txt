Two lights in the sky at the same height one to the east and one to the west. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter?  PD));2007-06-25 03:30:00;15 minutes plus;Two lights in the sky at the same height one to the east and one to the west both zigzagging irradically. On Monday morning, June 25th, at approximately 3:30 a.m. I spotted a light in the sky in the east. At first I thought it was a star. It was really far up, so it looked like a star, but it was super bright and it moved way too much. It was way too fast and far to be a helicopter or a plane, also I spotted a plane heading in itâ€™s direction. The light zigzagged in the same general area for the whole time I watched it. I then glanced around the sky and directly to the west of this light was another light. It was up in the sky at the same distance and was also zigzagging in the sky. The lights were directly across from each other one to the east and one to the west at the same height. I watched it for about 15 minutes and I headed in the house.
