Strange, slow moving black triangle seen.;2008-02-12 19:50:00;5-10 minutes;Strange, slow moving black triangle seen. I was over a friends house and around 7:50 pm or so, I had to move my car.  Upon walking outside I looked up at the sky because I heard a jet.  When I looked up I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  There was indeed a jet at a rather high altitude, but it was flying by a very low flying black, triangular craft.  The jet was clearly audible, but the triangle made no sound, and flew way too slow for it to be a commercial jet or anything of the sort. It had a strange array of lights, that outlined the triangular shape, three big lights, two white, one red (the red was in the front).  There were more lights, dim and seemed to pulse that outlined the sides of it that confirmed to me, that it was indeed a solid triangle.  The lights also didn't seem to illuminate it, which was rather eerie.  The jet soon passed it, and there was not a sound to be heard. It at very first seemed to be heading in the direction of the airport, but after moving my car, I noticed it wasn't heading in any direction in particular.  Rather, it moved in one direction, then seemed to slowly turn, and head in the opposite direction it was originally going. Note, the entire time this happened it had moved so slow, seriously could not believe it was there, I have seen low flying planes before, and this was no way that, I live near an airport, so it's a common thing for me to see.  I tried to get my friends attention to observe it, but he was in a rush, so only I saw it.  I did inform my friends upon getting inside his house that I had seen something that was truly strange flying over his house.  Sadly, I had no way of filming the object, but I can draw out a basic picture of what happened if need be.;42.9133;-85.8138341463414
