Extraterrestrial ships meet and then depart!;2000-05-10 22:00:00;1 minutes;Extraterrestrial ships meet and then depart! I was lying on my back observing the stars, when I seen three lights or I believe reflections traveling north like a spy satellite would be out in space.  It was unusual as there was three not just one and two were side by side and the third was behind one!  As I continued to watch them I seen a second light or reflection approaching from the east in a intercept course! I thought this is interesting!  Then to my disbelief the first vehicle stopped in mid flight and the second connected to the first!  I was astounded!   Then in just a few seconds the second vehicle shot off like a bullet back to the east and vanished in space!  I know we have nothing that could do such a thing!  Then the first vehicle immediately began its journey north again and slowly disappeared out of the suns reflecting rays!  I know this had to be an extraterrestrial event!  I know it!;43.1733;-83.5134
