Low flying object;2007-07-20 01:00:00;10min;Low flying object This is second hand from my cousin but I have no doubt that it happened he was dead serious and a little freaked out. It was like talking to a war veteran about his days in combat. I hope I don’t get this story wrong my cousin told me just once about it after I brought it up. I heard he saw something after some of the family was giving him a hard time about the experience saying he must have been drinking and didn’t take him serious (he's an honest person). My cousin (35yrs old) and his friend (33 yrs old) were at the friend’s house at about 1:00am, but I am not sure about the date (mid July?) 2007. They had been out fishing and were moving fishing gear back to his car from his friend’s vehicle. His friend said something about the neighbor (1 mile down) must have got a new yard light. They then noticed that the light looked like it was “wobbling” back and forth. Then all of a sudden the light slowly rose above the tree line still “wobbling”. I believe he said it was triangular shaped with three lights (one on each corner) he got a better look at it above the tree line. Then he said within a couple seconds it was a dot in the sky. It went straight up at a very high speed. After seeing it rise he said it might have been further away then what they originally thought (maybe 4 or 5 mi away?). It stayed up in the sky for a while looking like a star until it was gone. They were in the Otisville area and the object was toward the Columbiaville area.
