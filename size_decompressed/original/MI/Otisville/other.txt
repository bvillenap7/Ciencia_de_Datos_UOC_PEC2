Neon Orange lines making zigzags and circles in a small area;2020-10-10 16:30:00;5 minutes;Neon Orange lines making zigzags and circles in a small area On October 10, 2020 I was up around 4:30- 5a.m letting the dog outside.  I saw what I assumed was an airplane, but it was flying super low.  I grabbed my binoculars and followed the object as it traveled across the horizon. There was a neon orange light, and it was as moving around like crazy.  The only way i can describe it was that it looked like lines leftover from a sparkler, like when you move it around and it leaves a light trail.   I lost it in the trees.;43.1733;-83.5134
