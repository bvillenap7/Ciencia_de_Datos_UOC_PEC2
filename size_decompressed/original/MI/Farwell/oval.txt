Helicopters seen shortly after flying around until dark. First witnessed one craft slowly moving north in an unusual rate of speed (stopping completely at times) and at a low altitude (too low for a commercial aircraft)..  I pointed this anomaly out to my family members and we watched it for about 15 minutes until cloud cover blocked our view... this craft reflected the sunlight and was pill shaped. About 20 minutes after this incident, we witnessed another 2 crafts, moving across the sky from east to west, same shape and slow rate of speed as the first.  One trailed the other moving at the same rate of speed but not across the exact path.  We were able to observe these crafts for approximately 10 minutes total until they disappeared from view.  Shortly after this helicopters began working a grid pattern through the area until after nightfall (which also seemed bizarre for our area).;43.8343;-84.875
