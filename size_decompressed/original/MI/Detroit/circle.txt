white bright circle hung in the sky for approx. 3 seconds before gliding silently in a arc away(northernly) from it's position;1998-10-28 10:30:00;less than a minute;I had made this report soon after it happened before but can't find it.  About 10:30ish In October 1996 , I believe it was the 28th. as usual I took my dog in the backyard. to my left ( north easternly) a clean white bright circle hung in the sky for approx. 3 seconds before gliding silently in a arc away(northernly) from it's position and upwards in the sky until no longer visible.  the sky way clear.  I would guess the size to be between a quarter and a  50 cent peice held out at arms length. It seemed to be a bit away.  the whole thing took less than approx. 10 seconds.  strangely enough over the next week the dog wouldn't go into the back yard without me.

Orange orb UFO's transform and possibly land on Detroit's westside;2016-08-09 23:00:00;5 minutes;Orange orb UFO's transform and possibly land on Detroit's westside I don’t know how to put this into words  I am a great wordsmith, I just feel so much emotion at this time.  Last night (08/09/2016) I lay in my bed watching Netflix as my fiancee goes to open the front door for his friend.   After a short while, they both call my name, screaming.  The way that they were yelling made me think my cat had run into the street and got hit or something.  I jumped up and ran outside, only to find that his friend saw orange orbs in the sky.  At first, I was calm, and I replied, “Oh, I see these all the time I told you ufo are real... I see them all the time.”  His friend thought my statement to be strange she suggested we go inside but at first, I wasn’t afraid because I see them all the time.  She was so frightened that she left.  My fiancee decided that we needed to record this, so he went inside to look for my real camera.  Now I will describe what we saw. On Bryden St., between Joy Rd and Livernois, we spotted 12 orange orbs popping up in threes to the left of the sky just over Dearborn, Michigan, Warren Ave, and Wyoming area if you were facing west like we were.  The orbs appear from nowhere low in the sky and slowly floated up over the clouds.  Once they got high over the clouds, they changed to match the clouds they became the same color and even made themselves appear the same texture as the clouds, however, they had become disc shaped.  Once in this form, they floated across the sky towards us which was north to joy from Dearborn.  They appeared to glide across the sky, and they were silent.  Once directly over my hear I could see two dark gray circles on the bottom of the craft spinning.  Once they got just across Joy Rd almost to Chicago on Central, they began to lower they turned dark grayish black and dropped down from the sky to the ground. At that point, I was crying and panicking because I never saw them do that before, and they seemed to be trying to be invisible, and I was terrified, so I ran into the house crying.  I called my best friend the only person who would believe such a crazy story, and she doesn't believe in ufo, but she believes in me… she calmed me down and told me to pack an emergency bag just in case.  Last night I could barely sleep I was so scared.  I woke up today trying to tell myself it wasn't real.  I have no one to turn to, and life feels very different to me now.  I don't know what to think or how to feel or how to function without feeling like I'm going insane.  I hope that rant made sense.;42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819
There was a female in a car in front of the house that saw them.;2018-11-18 00:00:00;3 minutes;There was a female in a car in front of the house that saw them. I have never seen anything like it in my life. On November 18, 2018, multiple bright orange circular lights (12 objects) in the sky at 12:15 am. The objects moved around to form like an Orion belt The objects moved to form an image of small triangles, three in a group. The objects then formed a straight line and disappeared quickly. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and she seemed to us to be quite sincere.  We suspect that she is a highly reliable witness.  PD));42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819

Checked my phone compass and looks like they were headed about South. Night sky was overcast and stars are hard to see from light pollution. Only noticed the lights because they were moving. Lights were about as visible as the brighter stars. No other aircraft noticed in the sky at that time to reference.;42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819
