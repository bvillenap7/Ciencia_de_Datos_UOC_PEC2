Disc sighting in Detroit;1975-03-08 19:00:00;5-7 minutes;Disc sighting in Detroit These events happened on March 8th 1975 in Detroit MI. Sky was clear.  At about 7:00 pm in the evening I was walking to my friend’s house about a block and a half away. As I was walking I looked in the western sky and noticed a bright star, which was 90 degrees from me. It was unusual but I didn’t pay much attention. As I walked along I looked again and it not only had moved ahead but had gotten bigger which I began thinking was unusual. Walking along about 100 feet further I looked again and it had moved farther ahead and became much bigger. At this point I was nearing the end of the block and started to watch it continually. It started moving closer and became much bigger. The last time I looked I had crossed to the next block and it was hovering almost directly above me. It was a ball perhaps 150 feet in diameter, without sound and had a red light on the bottom. At this time I sprinted the half block to my friends house.;42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819
Spherical type craft seen over Detroit river between the cities of Detroit and Windsor, disappears into small black rain cloud.;2006-09-15 11:00:00;5 minutes;Spherical type craft seen over Detroit river between the cities of Detroit and Windsor, disappears into small black rain cloud. This event took place in the fall of 2006.  I’m not sure the day or the exact month, it was either September or November.  The time was around 11:00-12:00 noon.  I was at work in Detroit.  My office was at the Renaissance building, with my desk having a window view facing the city of Windsor, over looking the Detroit River. While I was busy talking on the phone, I noticed a small, bright light that was traveling up the river that had just passed the Ambassador Bridge that connects the USA with Canada.  At first I thought it was a small airplane or something similar, until it was close enough to notice it was a round shaped sphere.  It had a very highly polished metal that was reflecting the Sun and giving the appearance of a lighted craft.   My co-worker and I both looked taken back, as this machine was bopping up and down in the air over the river, about 20 feet or more above the surface.  It was about 10 feet in diameter or so it appeared. It made no noise, as all craft that travel on the river or anywhere in our tower can hear just about all noises from vehicles, aircraft, watercraft, etc.  The building is not very good for keeping sounds out. This machine was solid looking all over, no visible portals or attachments.  It had a round, small black little ball that traveled around the object about every second that was not attached.  The sphere turned in front of the Renaissance building and headed toward the Canadian side of the river.  Went up and over the Windsor hotel, still not high in the air, about 20 feet or so.  Weaving, bobbing ever so slightly, not traveling as though it was in a hurry, but rather seemed to be checking things out is what it felt like to us.  It climbed up and went up into a small black rain cloud.  The black rain cloud looked odd to us for some reason.  Also, it was the only cloud visible on a clear blue day.  I could see jets taking off in the background at the Windsor airport.  My co-worker and I watched the rain cloud for a long time, at least 5-10 minutes, until the cloud dissipated.  The machine never came out or went through the cloud to the other side.  I inquired with people in the building ! who would have had a good chance of hearing or seeing anything that goes on in the area.  As far as I know, we were the only people to see it, but I find it rather hard to believe, as this was broad daylight during lunchtime in downtown Detroit.

It looked like a flaming ball of fire moving at  fast rate of speed from the South to the North.;2011-07-04 22:30:00;1 hr;It looked like a flaming ball of fire moving at  fast rate of speed from the South to the North. The first time we saw the sphere it was approximately 10:30 PM.  My neighbor saw the orange fiery sphere in the sky from the back yard.  He told us all to look and pointed at it.   It looked like it had a trail of fire moving underneath it and behind it a little too.  It was a pretty good size sphere and was moving at a high rate of speed from the South to North.  We all ran from the back yard to the front to follow it and then it stopped in the same place for about one minute then it just disappeared. At about 11:00 PM my boyfriend and I were outside in the front yard and we spotted the sphere in the same place that it disappeared.   We tried to get a video of it with our phones but we could not pick up the sphere quick enough.  This time the orange sphere was staying in the same place but only stayed glowing for about 30-45 seconds. Then the third sighting was about 11:15 PM.  I was standing alone on the back porch letting the dogs out to go to the bathroom and I saw the orange sphere again moving at a steady fast pace from South to North I ran from the back of the house and out the front door and by the time I got there I saw it disappear in the trees.;42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819

Detroit;2011-07-29 00:30:00;45 sec.;Walking home from the casino at about 12:30 AM, 7/29/11, a flying object was observed in the skies above Detroit, MI.   The object was sphere like and completely silent, appearing relatively close at first as a steady bright amber/yellow light, but gradually pulsating to a deep red color every 10 seconds or so.   The object moved swiftly across the sky moving further away.   It was observed for approx. 45 seconds, I looked away for a few moments, and when I looked back, the object had completely vanished.;42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819
