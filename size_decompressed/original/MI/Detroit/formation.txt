My location was between I-75 and I-94. While driving home at approximately 7:10pm, my a light caught my eye as I was driving due East towards I-94. (I was talking to my boyfriend on my cell phone as well.) I saw 5 balls of light total, 2-3 much brighter than an average falling star. I'd say that in comparison to the brightest star in the sky, the size was perhaps 4 to 5 times larger as well as brighter. They were moving VERY slow, almost hovering. All 5 were very close together and they never strayed from each other. I kept saying Wow! wow! wow! to my boyfriend the whole time, thinking that I was witnessing a meteor shower (I've never seen one before). They didn't seem to fade away until about 25-30 later. They were yellow in color with no tail. I kept looking up in the sky after that, but I didn't see anything. I normally wouldn't be writing in to report this, but after talking with another witness, he said it would be beneficial to you if I report what I saw. I'm not a sceptic of UFOs, nor am I a believer. I DO, however, have an open mind about things. And the fact that there is a REMOTE chance that this may be something other than falling debris from space (as stated in a Detroit newspaper the next day) compelled me to write to you today. I hope that this helps in your studies.;42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819

LIGHTED OBJECTS SIGHTED OVER DETROIT I75 HIGHWAY;2011-09-11 22:45:00;2 minutes;LIGHTED OBJECTS SIGHTED OVER DETROIT I-75 HIGHWAY My daughter and I, and two other people that we spoke to, were driving along I75N just south of the Southfield exit and saw 4 lighted objects rise into the sky, first in a sort of arched line formation, and as they ascended the formation changed into like a box formation.  I took some not too great shots with my cell phone camera.  This was not any type of aircraft or chemical light, these were OBJECTS, LIGHTED OBJECTS.

Two large, round, bright white lights above Detroit then suddenly disappear.;2015-10-31 14:30:00;20 minutes;Two large, round, bright white lights above Detroit then suddenly disappear. Two large, round bright white lights in the sky above Detroit.  Looked hazy around the lights which give me the impression that it was in clouds.   I didn't give the lights much notice at first but when I realized they didn't move or fade away it caught my attention.   I began watching them while driving east on I-96.   After I noticed them they disappeared about 30 seconds later.  ' They also had some very small lights around these two giant round lights.
