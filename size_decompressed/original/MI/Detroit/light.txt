As I drove eastward;1979-11-20 07:10:00;30 minutes;Obserbed bright disc in upper right quadrant of windshield as I was backing out of my drive, car was facing sough. As I drove eastward toward Detroit Metro Airport, object stayed in upper quadrant of windshield.  As I stopped for traffic light at the intersesction of Wick and Middlebelt Roads, object stopped. I obserbed object through bare branches of a large tree across the intersection.  As light changed to green, I proceeded through the intersection. A smaller bright disc-shaped object separated from the larger disc.  Smaller disc proceeded due south at a very high rate of speed while the larger object changed to a southeasterly direction.  I soon lost the object in the sun which by now had topped the trees in the area. A co-worker had also seen the same objects at the same intersection.  She was two cars behind me.  The object had to pass directly over Detroit Metro Airport, yet no story ever appeared on any news broadcast! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819

We were flying from Pittsburg, PA to Saginaw, michigan at an altitude of 16,000 ft in a Beech 1900D turboprop.  We saw a bright light at our altitude over detroit.  We asked Cleveland Center (Air Traffic Control) if they had any traffic.  They did not.  We were heading northwest bound (~ 330 heading).  Light persisted for approx 20 min until we descended for landing in Saginaw.  Distance was difficult to tell at night.  I know that two other aircraft saw the light, and one of them took a photograph (which was eventually on a web site).  I was curious if you have this event on file and whether it was ever explained (flare for ex.).  I would like this report to remain confidential but would appreciate further info please do not release my name. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with the witness, and find him to be a quite credible witness.  We have also spoken with the pilot of the aircraft, and we have the audio of the radio communication with the FAA.  A photograph was taken from a second aircraft, and is in the hands of a journalist.  He wrote an article about the incident, but when he submitted the article to his editor, he was told that the newspaper did not print articles about UFO's.  PD));42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819

I saw a very faint light traveling northward and it disappeared and then another appeared traveling southwards in opposite direction;2012-06-26 22:35:00;30 seconds;I saw a very faint light traveling northward and it disappeared and then another appeared traveling southwards in opposite direction To tell the truth there were two of them.  One was heading due north. I noticed it out of the side of my eye even though it was a extremely faint light. There were no blinkking lights on it. Neither one of them. ASn airplane flew just in front of the first one and lept goin heading east. The plane flew higher than most planes but it was still closer than this object.  Both objects to be exact. I watched this object for about 40 seconds and then lost track of it.  I scanned the sky and found another extremely faint light traveling due south off to the righ of where the original spotted light was. I don't wear glasses and I could still see this light even though it was very faint. That's why I knew that these two objects weren't traveling in our atmosphere. It was way fainter than the International Space Station would appear in the sky. Besides I don't think the ISS would travel in two opposite directions. The time was 10:35 p.m. Venus is much brighter than what ! they were. But these were white lights with no sound at all.

I saw a pencil eraser sized light crossing the sky;2012-07-02 22:16:00;1 minute;I saw a pencil eraser sized light crossing the sky light heading due northwest bright yellowish white light with no blinking lights at 10:16 pm it was circular looking like a small moon about the size of a eraser on a pencil.   I saw this while watching a Rich Dad seminar online sitting on my porch.  It was almost dead ahead of my vision slightly off to the left of my sight.   It flew across the sky and I had to wait for a few seconds to clear away from the trees to see it again to only see it disappear behind some more trees.  This is no joke. It's what I saw though I have found that the meteor society would tell me that my sightings were mere planes or satellites.   never knew that you could see an actual satellite in space with your naked eye.  That part goes with my past report of the small barely visible lights in the sky. This however was just as bright as the moon only smaller.  My house faces east and I wartched it cross the sky heading north west ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

White light over Detroit & Windsor moving significantly faster & different direction than normal heavy early night airport traffic.;2020-02-13 21:20:00;1 minute;White light over Detroit & Windsor moving significantly faster & different direction than normal heavy early night airport traffic. I drive from work in Michigan through Detroit to my home in Windsor, Ontario.  On my drive, I often watch planes coming in or out of Metro Airport, or helicopters, often with searchlights over the city. Last night was overcast with high clouds.  I spotted a white light I assumed was a plane headed to the airport.  Only one light, no multiple or red lights like a plane.  More like a satellite, but it was cloudy. It was coming over downtown from the east like planes to the airport would.  But, it was moving significantly faster than any jet or helicopter.  Not streaking across the sky, but 4 or 5 times faster than any jet coming in to land. It appeared to change direction headed south, but the freeway I was on has curves, so it may have just been that.  But, it headed south over Windsor, and disappeared over the horizon. Planes come into the airport from the east over Windsor/Detroit.  They do not turn south over Windsor & disappear over the horizon. The whole sighting was 30 to 60 seconds.  Watching a plane come in from the east, it's visible a good 2-3 minutes. It did not seem to change speed.  But it moved significantly faster than any jet - including the occasional fighter jet from Selfrige AFB north east of Detroit. As I said, it resembled a white light like a satellite, but it was cloudy with high clouds, and this was below the clouds.  Other than the speed, direction, and being a single white light, it would have been something I've seen hundreds of times on this drive.  But this was definately not that.  It was easily several times faster than any jet headed to land, and it went the wrong direction, actually crossing at a right angle where jets coming from the he west turn around to head west to the air port.;42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819
Two giant light orbs moving over Detroit.;2020-08-01 20:00:00;5  minutes;Two giant light orbs moving over Detroit. Myself and two friends were enjoying a summer night on a friends roof top in Midtown Detroit. We were looking up into the night sky when above us at the height of planes fly over to land at the airport two giant orb like things appeared. I shouted to my two friends to look. We all couldn’t take our eyes away in amazement.  Their shapes were identical and their light was perfect no hot spots or dimming in areas. They were moving in the same directions at a very fast speed to the west of the city. They would move as separate and then come together as one and then separate and coming me back together. They did this twice before shooting off to were we couldn’t see them anymore. We were all shocked nothing I’ve never seen anything move like that before in my life. Now I can’t stop looking up.;42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819
