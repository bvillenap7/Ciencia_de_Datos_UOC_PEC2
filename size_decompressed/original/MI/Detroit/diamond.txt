It was unusual since it blinked in an abnormal pattern. It was brightly blinking.  A it traveled across the sky I stepped off of my porch tp watch this object cross the sky in a due north western direction. As it got closer to me I noticed that it didn't look nothing like an airplane.  It was diamond shape.Airplanes usually have those red and blue lights flashing on them. This was a continuous white flashing light crossing the sky. I watched it for as long as I could and even walked over towards my neighbors house to keep it in sight. It was moving fast unlike the two objects I saw earlier. For as low as it was there was a slight sound to it that should've been louder like the airplane flying over me now. at 23:34 heading into the eastern direction. I can hear that plane loud and clear. But the objec! t in question I could barely even hear and it was lower than the one heading east. They didn't even blink the same. The object in question was very bright. It blinked rapidly with only white lights. I dont know what it was, but it wasn't a normal airlines plane. And it wasn't no meteorite either. And if you say it was a weather balloon then I'm a monkey's uncle. That's how serious I am. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
