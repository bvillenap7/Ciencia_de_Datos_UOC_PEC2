It was bright enough to be seen even with all the background light over detroit metro.  Three different people working the parking ramp saw this object.;42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819

I was taking a photo for my cell phone screen saver of the sun between two clouds. There was nothing passing in the path of the sun, I snap the photo and then when inside of a house.  As I went to view the photo in which I'd downloading on my cell phone, there appeared a black speck in the center of the photo where the sun was located. I then zoom in on the photo, the image appeared dome shaped, spinning, with ( or travelling at a very rapid speed ) a half circular smoke mist beneath it.;42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819

Extremely loud noise over Detroit area;2014-10-03 23:55:00;3 seconds;Extremely loud noise over Detroit area At 6 mile and telegraph. At approx 11:55 tonight, myself and another witness heard an extremely loud roar pass over the area.  I was sitting under an open window, and this clearly came from the sky.  We are in a direct path for Detroit Metroit Airport.  At first, i thought it was a jet coming in.  But the rate of which the sound approached and dissipated was far too fast for a commercial jet.  Not to mention so loud, it would have been at a much lower altitude. Ive witnessed large meteorites witnessed over multiple states. I've also witnessed jets breaking the sound barrier.  This did not sound like that at all.  No impact, shockwave or sonic boom was heard.  The third witness, approximately 1.5 miles west, and outside during this event, heard it, but did not notice any lights either. Strangely, this past winter, we heard what sounded like pulse jets on occasion.  Usually at night, once during the day.  Think Nazi V1 buzz bombs. Internet searches yielded no results pertaining to aircraft making such noises in cold dense air.  Somethings definitely going on over Southeast Michigan the passed few months.;42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819
