Amazing dayligt sighting of huge silver cigar shaped ufo;2007-07-07 10:45:00;15 seconds;Amazing dayligt sighting of huge silver cigar shaped ufo I was driving west on Plymouth in detroit michigan turning on north bound Telegraph. Its a rather long merge lane. As I turned into the curve I saw a cigar shaped , very bright silver ufo. I first thought it was a plane but it didnt move at all.We have a flight pattern over my house so I know the size of planes as they come in for a landing. This thing was about 4 times the size of a plane at that height and distance. It was no more than a couple hundred feet in the air and less than a mile away. There seem to be a tinge of red on the back end of it. I watched it as I turned onto telegraph rd. It stayed perfectly still. As i turned my head to make sure there were no cars in the lane I turned back to look to make sure the ufo was still there but it was gone. I looked all around but it was nowhere to be seen.;42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819
