I saw lights throbbing like a light bulb going off and on coming from a distance towards my residence.   When the lights came close I saw a large black metal looking craft slowly going forward in the sky.  My view was from the side so I could not tell the over all shape other than to say it looked very angular and had ends that were not simular.  It was surrounded top and bottom by piercing beautiful blue lights.   I was scared but I also felt that the craft was in trouble and had nearly stopped due to what seemed like a power failure. Then it suddenly shot high speed toward downtown Detroit taking a nearly 90 degree turn. I ran in the house AND LOCKED MYSELF IN MY BEDROOM AND CALLED MY MOTHER AND BOYFRIEND.  My boyfriend was at the bar and all of his friends had a good laugh on me.  I told them I was sure others had seen it and  I bet they would hear about it on the news.  I loved the look on my boyfriends face when it later came on the news.   HAHAHA!!!!!;42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819
Angels or UFO's on stormy morning?;2002-08-19 06:00:00;8 to 10 minutes;Angels or UFO's on stormy morning? About 6am on august 19, 2002 there was a storm heading east towards Detroit.  Lighting was flashing. No thunder. Rain had not started yet.  I was driving my work truck when a flash of lighting lit the sky, I happened to look up and what I believed to be the Fisher building approx. 50 floors high with a big red lit ball on top.  It appeared like birds but only to big to be birds. Because they covered the ball, it appeared they were startled from the lighting and they flew into a boomerang type formation. There was a yellow glow at first turning to red as they drifted southeast, towards Canada.  When the lighting lit up the sky, the top of the building lit up white.  Thats when it appeared to me that angels were taking off.  I know it sounds silly but this is what I saw. I was not drinking nor do I use drugs and had a restful nights sleep the night before.;42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819

I don’t make a practice of telling lies or wild stories I don’t do any drugs, and have no criminal record. I’m not too worried about my privacy as I have nothing to hide, and if anyone has more questions about my sighting I would be happy to try and answer them.  I was on the thirteenth floor of the apartment building I work for in downtown Detroit.  It was a very sunny day, and something in the sky was reflecting the sun light and it caught my eye.  At first I thought it was one of those silver looking aluminum balloons a child might have, but it seemed to be moving towards me at a high rate of speed as it was now much to large to be a child’s balloon.  I can now make out the shape of the craft as it seems to have stopped in mid-air only a few hundred feet outside the window I’m standing at.  It has a clover shape to it.. Three disk shapes connected in the center, with a sort of bulged center area. At this point the craft starts to rotate up on its side, so that the bottom of the craft is facing towards me. I see a blinking red light in the center of the craft and each clover has a large white circular light on it taking up most of the area of the bottom of these three disks. It’s very hard to explain the features of the craft in words.  So at this point it’s been maybe 30-40 seconds that I’ve been watching this thing, and it’s now hovering at a 90 degree angle to me just a few hundred feet out my window on the thirteenth floor.  I start to get the feeling this thing knows I see it and it can see me, as it suddenly displays a light sequence of blue, green, white, and red in an extremely fast flickering pattern. I don’t know how else to describe this light array other than hypnotic in nature, it lasted only a few seconds and when the light show was over, the craft rotated back down from the right angle it was at, and floated off in a south easterly direction (basically directly over Comerica Park) until I lost sight of it.  This is absolutely 100% the truth, and the strangest experience I’ve ever had in my life. I’m not the type of person who looks for these kinds of things or believes every conspiracy theory out there, more than anything else I hope maybe someone else reported the same thing and I can help confirm there story.;42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819

On Oct,19  2009 at around 6:30pm, I was working on the 18th floor of my apartment building in downtown Detroit, when I noticed something floating around the two smoke stacks on the power plant near my place.  It seemed to be hovering directly through the smoke of the stacks, and then around the two stacks, and then it would float a few blocks away and then back to the stacks.   At this point I had been watching this thing for about 8 minutes or so when I ran to grab my camera and returned with my girl freind and my brother in law (who was a tanker in the military).  So I snapped off these pics which I can't explain. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD));42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819

Response to SHGbo+14a. Logansport, IN;2012-04-06 12:55:00;10 min;Response to SHGbo+14a. Logansport, IN This is a copied article, posted as requested. These articles cover rare information on SETI signal SHGb02+14a  [Article 1] Mysterious signals from light years away  19:00 01 September 2004 by Eugenie Samuel Reich  In February 2003, astronomers involved in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) pointed the massive radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, at around 200 sections of the sky. The same telescope had previously detected unexplained radio signals at least twice from each of these regions, and the astronomers were trying to reconfirm the findings. The team has now finished analysing the data, and all the signals seem to have disappeared. Except one, which has got stronger. This radio signal, now seen on three separate occasions, is an enigma. It could be generated by a previously unknown astronomical phenomenon. Or it could be something much more mundane, maybe an artefact of the telescope itself. But it also happens to be the best candidate yet for a contact by intelligent aliens in the nearly six-year history of the SETI@home project, which uses programs running as screensavers on millions of personal computers worldwide to sift through signals picked up by the Arecibo telescope. Absorb and emit  It's the most interesting signal from SETI@home, says Dan Werthimer, a radio astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley (UCB) and the chief scientist for SETI@home. We're not jumping up and down, but we are continuing to observe it.  Named SHGb02+14a, the signal has a frequency of about 1420 megahertz. This happens to be one of the main frequencies at which hydrogen, the most common element in the universe, readily absorbs and emits energy. Some astronomers have argued that extraterrestrials trying to advertise their presence would be likely to transmit at this frequency, and SETI researchers conventionally scan this part of the radio spectrum. SHGb02+14a seems to be coming from a point between the constellations Pisces and Aries, where there is no obvious star or planetary system within 1000 light years. And the transmission is very weak. We are looking for something that screams out &#145artificial', says UCB researcher Eric Korpela, who completed the analysis of the signal in April. This just doesn't do that, but it could be because it is distant. Unknown signature  The telescope has only observed the signal for about a minute in total, which is not long enough for astronomers to analyse it thoroughly. But, Korpela thinks it unlikely SHGb02+14a is the result of any obvious radio interference or noise, and it does not bear the signature of any known astronomical object. That does not mean that only aliens could have produced it. It may be a natural phenomenon of a previously undreamed-of kind like I stumbled over, says Jocelyn Bell Burnell of the University of Bath, UK. It was Bell Burnell who in 1967 noticed a pulsed radio signal which the research team at the time thought was from extraterrestrials but which turned out to be the first ever sighting of a pulsar. There are other oddities. For instance, the signal's frequency is drifting by between eight to 37 hertz per second. The signal is moving rapidly in frequency and you would expect that to happen if you are looking at a transmitter on a planet that's rotating very rapidly and where the civilisation is not correcting the transmission for the motion of the planet, Korpela says. This does not, however, convince Paul Horowitz, a Harvard University astronomer who looks for alien signals using optical telescopes. He points out that the SETI@home software corrects for any drift in frequency. Fishy and puzzling  The fact that the signal continues to drift after this correction is fishy, he says. If [the aliens] are so smart, they'll adjust their signal for their planet's motion.  The relatively rapid drift of the signal is also puzzling for other reasons. A planet would have to be rotating nearly 40 times faster than Earth to have produced the observed drift a transmitter on Earth would produce a signal with a drift of about 1.5 hertz per second. What is more, if telescopes are observing a signal that is drifting in frequency, then each time they look for it they should most likely encounter it at a slightly different frequency. But in the case of SHGb02+14a, every observation has first been made at 1420 megahertz, before it starts drifting. It just boggles my mind, Korpela says. The signal could be an artefact that, for some reason, always appears to be coming from the same point in the sky. The Arecibo telescope has a fixed dish reflector and scans the skies by changing the position of its receiver relative to the dish. When the receiver reaches a certain position, it might just be able to reflect waves from the ground onto the dish and then back to itself, making it seem as if the signal was coming from space.  Perhaps there is an object on the ground near the telescope emitting at about this frequency, Korpela says. This could be confirmed by using a different telescope to listen for SHGb02+14a. Possible fraud  There is also the possibility of fraud by someone hacking the SETI@home software to make it return evidence for an extraterrestrial transmission. However, SHGb02+14a was seen on two different occasions by different SETI@home users, and those calculations were confirmed by others.  Then the signal was seen a third time by the SETI@home researchers. The unusual characteristics of the signal also make it unlikely that someone is playing a prank, Korpela says. As I can't think of any way to make a signal like this, I can't think of any way to fake it.  David Anderson, director of SETI@home, remains sceptical but curious about the signal. It's unlikely to be real but we will definitely be re-observing it. Bell Burnell agrees that it is worth persisting with. If they can see it four, five or six times it really begins to get exciting, she says.  It is already exciting for IT engineers Oliver Voelker of Logpoint in Nuremberg, Germany and Nate Collins of Farin and Associates in Madison, Wisconsin, who found the signal.  Collins wonders how his bosses will react to company computers finding aliens. I might have to explain a little further about just how much I was using [the computers], he says.  Ref: http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn6341-mysterious-signals-from-light-years-away.html?full=true   [Article 2]  Radio source SHGb02+14a  Radio source SHGb02+14a is a source and a candidate in the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI), discovered on March 2003 by SETI@home and announced in New Scientist on September 1, 2004.[1]  The source was observed three times at a frequency of about 1420 MHz,[2] which is expected to be a frequency used by extraterrestrials due to its proximity to one of the main frequencies at which hydrogen absorbs and radiates photons.  There are a number of puzzling features of this candidate, which have led to a large amount of skepticism. The source is located between the constellations Pisces and Aries, a direction in which no stars are observed within 1000 light years. It is also a very weak signal. The frequency of the signal has a rapid drift, which would correspond to it being emitted from a planet orbiting nearly 40 times faster than the Earth around the sun. However, each time the signal was detected, it was again at about 1420 MHz, the original frequency before any drift.  There are also a number of potential explanations for this signal. SETI@home has denied media reports of likely extraterrestrial signal.[3][4] It could be an artifact of random chance, cosmic noise or possibly just a glitch in the technology.

I take pictures on my lunch break at the Detroit River with my phone.  I'm usually at Hart Plaza which sits on the river front directly across from Windsor, Canada.  Back then I took burst shots.  Didn't notice until later that day that I had captured a square like object floating above the river on the Canadian side.  It flashed different colors and glyphs on a split screen like monitor on its face.It had weird protusions around the sides of it.  I have recovered video of it which is not as sharp as the original and close ups.  If I remember right, google photos turned the burst images into a video.
