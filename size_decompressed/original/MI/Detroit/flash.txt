Once i did every thing just turn into a big flash and the power had went out in the house and about 30 secs later it just came back on.  It was like a giant thing just hovering there just as if it was camouflaged in the sky.  Then it was gone just like that like light fast like gone no where to be seen I was shocked so i just looked up ufo sighting this is where it brung me..

We witnessed 3 bright objects flying in a circular pattern which at first we thought were birds.  ((anonymous report));2019-01-05 14:00:00;10 minutes;We witnessed 3 bright objects flying in a circular pattern, which at first we thought were birds.  But we realize that the objects were very high in the sky.  They look to be at least Maybe 2000 to 3000 ft over head, is my guess.  They were flying in close proximity to one another making large circles and started to pulsate and glow off and on.   We were standing there looking in the sky trying to figure out what the objects were.  Then objects started moving East from our area where we first saw them.  They were still pulsating off and on and moving Eastward.  Seemed that we’re over head at first, then far away before we knew it.   I told a young lady that had witnessed the same thing to get a video of the objects before they disappear out of view.  Which we have.  By the time she started recording the objects were faraway from where we were at.  They seem like stars.  Then one object stayed on it seemed and started traveling in a straight line going southern direction.  Came to a stop.  Which at this time it looked like a bright star in the sky.  I was focused on that object when all of a sudden to the left of object another object started to glow like the first one.  They were at the same level in a straight line.  Then they disappeared.   Afterwards, I had notice on my sunglasses yellow dust was on my lens and powder of some sort was on my black hoodie sweater.  If someone wants to collect samples let me know and I won’t wash it.  It was a clear sunny day and could see the objects very clearly.. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819
