At that point 6 or 7 smaller bright-light objects came out of the larger ship and circled the craft.  Appeared to be circling 100 yards or so from the larger craft.  Lasting approximately 10 minutes, the objects then returned one-by-one inside the main craft.  One minute later the craft accelerated so quickly it disappeared within seconds, again no sound whatsoever.  We couldn't believe what we saw. Being only 14-15 years of age we called the Detroit police who quickly dismissed us. Plane, Blimp, Weather Balloon, Helicopter?  Absolutely not.  We never read anything about the sighting in the paper or saw any TV news reports.;42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819
Oval shape craft seen in cloudbank  tilting back and forth.;1988-09-21 15:51:00;1 minute;Oval shape craft seen in cloudbank  tilting back and forth. I live about 10 miles from the Wayne County Airport and have a picture window facing southwest. This window is located in my upstairs den. My house is located along a flight path, so I often see planes landing and taking off. I often track them with binoculars and watch the spectacular sunsets and military jets that are routinely streaking across the sky. My kids and I were on our way to dinner so I took a quick look with my binoculars out the window at a cloud bank. That’s when I saw an oval/egg shaped object tipping back and forth but going in a straight line. It was a dull brown in color and the sun was behind it. The strange thing is that when I lowered my binoculars in disbelief the craft was not visible to the naked eye. But when I raised them it was visible again and still going along the same trajectory which was west to east, I believe. I watched it until it went out of sight from my point of view. It was solid and had to be huge. The way it appeared in my view was as clear and solid as planes at the height and distance have appeared to me. A military jet followed roughly along the same path but above it 3-5 minutes later.  I’ve always believed in UFOs but this is my first sighting. I personally believe they are spiritual in nature but I digress.;42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819
Ufo's over Detroit, Dearborn western area.;2012-05-23 21:00:00;3 hrs;Ufo's over Detroit, Dearborn western area. On 5/23/2012 wed at 9:30pm the wife and i sat outside on the front porch facing west we saw for a second time a craft hovering in the tree line the same as sunday evening. A half hour later two more appeared one south of the first and one north of the first. We are located in Detroit's Warrendale area. The forth was east over pass our house. They are round looking flashing white,green,red lights. The white stayed on longer. I called my freind in Romulus he said he saw them also looking North of Van Born rd. Our daughter came and watch then we saw a big one flying south it had white lights all around flashing around the whole craft going South West towards metro airport over Dearborn. This was not a jet liner or any man made craft. Please note each time during the sighting dogs were braking in the area. And the crafts make no noise at all. I have stayed near metro airport since 1969 I know jets and helicopters during the day and at night. The other 3 stayed stationary as if they are surveying or surveillance almost in a triangle in the night sky. The first one in the trees it like had a bounce up and down movement and went North towards Farmington or Southfield area and fade away. We went in at 12:00 midnight;42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819

Oval object with depth stationary, viewed from plane.;2017-09-29 13:00:00;15-20 seconds;Oval object with depth stationary, viewed from plane I'm an engineer, I was on a plane flying to Detroit.  I was looking North at a break in the clouds.  I could see green farmland below through the clouds, the clouds were thicker on the East & West sides as the break in the clouds gave me the ability to see the ground below.  The plane was approximately 25,000 feet up.  I would not have noticed anything if the object didn't move at this very moment, it was stationary right next to the West cloud, then it moved forward some, then to the right then forward again to then hide in the East side cloud edge.  I couldn't believe my eyes.  The object was oval but it had depth and the top surface was pure white.  This oval was the shape of a track & field track, so parallel in the middle with rounded ends.  But the top surface was perfectly flat, and pure white. I would not have seen it, if it didn't move.  The sides were a grey/white color,  I could see very thin vertical black striations.  The object was rigid, the top white surface came to a very obvious edge, then 90 degrees straight down.  The vertical drop was what appeared to be about half what the short length width was.  The object had no obvious propulsion mechanism, no observable heat waves, no radiations, no light emmissions that I could see.  It did not tilt to move forward, did not tilt to the side, then did not change its orientation to move forward again.  It just moved, I believe  I would have missed it if it didn't move at all.  From my eyes it was approximately an ! inch to 1.5 inches in length.  Length is the rounded ends to each other, width then was the parallel sides to each other, depth was the white edge to the bottom of the grey striations.  The bottom also came to a very rigid end. This object definitely appeared to be hiding in the clouds.  No windows, no radar apparatus, no spinning anything, no external attachments.

A silver elongated metal-looking oval way up in the sky.;2018-09-22 19:43:00;a few seconds;A silver elongated metal-looking oval way up in the sky. Strange oval object in the sky, September 22, 2018 over Detroit, MI. I made a turn on a street in Grosse Pointe bordering the city limits of Detroit.  As I turn right, I see the beautiful sky with pink clouds on my left.  I snapped a picture of the clouds and didn’t think more of it. I looked at the picture again a day later and saw a strange oval object through an opening of the clouds.  If it was closer to the ground, I would guess the Goodyear Blimp. But I’ve seen blimps flying before and this is too high for them to fly.  It also doesn’t look like an airplane with the vapor trails.  I’ve just never seen this before.  It’s like a silver metal elongated “bullet” way up in the sky.;42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819
