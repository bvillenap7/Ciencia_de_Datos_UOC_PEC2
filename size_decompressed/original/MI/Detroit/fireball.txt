A friend of mine was following me, so I pulled over and asked her what is that, her and her passenger looked and said what the hell is that,   I then looked around to see if anyone else had witnessed what we was seeing, people in the barbershop was looking, people that was coming out the grocery store was looking and some traffic had stopped and was looking,   I turned back and looked at the objects and called my wife on her cell phone but I kept going to voicemail so I called my daughter and ask where was her mother and to go get her and look out the back window and look at all these UFOs in the sky, she woke up my wife and told her, all I can hear was my wife saying oh s***, what is going on an invasion, now all 15 or 20 of them were in a pyramid formation, I noticed that the last two on the left was coming down and stopped and went back up, they then lined up in a straight line never making a sound, they was changing colors red,orange, yellow and getting brighter they hovered a little more and then slowly moving towards northeast very slow still not making a sound I then started driving home but still looking at them, when I pulled in my driveway and could still see the last two of them and I noticed the last one was getting so bright it looked like it had a ring around the bottom that really kept getting brighter like it was drawing energy from something, it looked like a donut shape or Saturn ring, I went in the house and talked to my wife and daughter and said I'm about to follow them but when I went back outside I didn't see them anymore,I drove in the direction that they were going still didn't see them, and then rain just started pouring down instantly, I drove back home and called fox 2 news to report the objects and the news said that they had several calls about that and was waiting on video footage;42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819
Single red orange ball over Detroit.;2015-07-21 22:20:00;3-5 minutes;Single red orange ball over Detroit. Looking south towards downtown Detroit and the river that divides Detroit from Windsor in Canada (standing about a mile and a half from downtown and the river), I saw a single fire colored roundish object between me and the river.  It first appeared to be still, but then I may have been adjusting to 'this is not a small plane, where are its lights?'  Maybe it was moving, but slowly.  In general it was moving east parallel to the river.  It might have made a 'adjustments' in its movement a couple times.  Slight right turns toward the river.  Its movement was not always steady or at the same (slow) speed.  Clear night with some wispy white clouds.  After watching it just a few minutes it disappeared into a cloud.  Don't know how long it had been there before I came out at 10:20. Its height or size was that of a small plane flying at the top altitude allowed by small planes over a city.  Not the lower altitude at which a plane flying over a baseball game might be.  A neighbor was able to see it without their glasses. I searched this description, and found a lot of images matching what I saw.  The colors of fire.  Not a single spectrum red or orange light.  There was nothing else in the sky.  Quiet.  No planes, large or small, or helicopters.;42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819
A large orange fireball and I could see inside of ball a metallic ship with a wingspan pointing upward.;2018-06-30 23:27:00;20 seconds;On 6/30/18 @ 11:27 p.m i was on front porch of my home watching neighbor's fireworks when i saw a faint object in the southwestern sky and it was coming in a downward trajectory right at me and increased in size.  A large orange fireball and I could see inside of ball a metallic ship with a wingspan pointing upward.  It made no sound at all.   I screamed and my eyes poured water from fear of what i saw.  The orange ball was so bright it reflected light off the clouds.  Fireball was translucent.  I hung the phone up and ran to take pictures.  I obtained 2 photos of rear of ship.  By then it disappeared in the northeastern sky.  I have not been the same since incident.  Everytime I think of or repeat story I breakdown weeping.  I was up close to this event.  My life will never be the same.;42.3796073359074;-83.1125823680819
