Moving light in sky for over 2 hours.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of stars.  Tails are optical effect of camera, possibly.  PD));2006-09-09 02:00:00;2 hrs.;moving light in sky for over two hours My husband and I, and friends were camping at a field in Sturgis,Mi.  It was a biker event for children.  We were sitting around the campfire (2:00 a.m.) and observed in the sky a light darting around.  At first we figured it was a kite by the darting motions it made.  After watching it do other maneuvers we ruled that out.  I took my camera out and attempted to take pictures.  Not knowing whether anything would show up because the object was so high.  I watched for at least 2 hours and it was still there in the sky when I went to sleep.  When I arrived home I downloaded the pictures and with zoom it appears that there were two crafts not one and in a circular shape.  Also, some kind of trails that I can't explain.;41.8056000000001;-85.4261999999999
Ball of light SW of Sturgis, Mi. looked like an extremely close and bright planet but vanished suddenly.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus?  PD));2013-11-23 18:22:00;1 hour;Ball of light South West of Sturgis, Mi. looked like an extremely close and bright planet but vanished suddenly. Was outside tonight looking to the south west when a friend and I noticed a giant orb of white light hovering in the sky making no noise.   We thought it was possibly Venus, but the light appeared to have some sort of tail like a comet, but was stationary and not moving across the sky.  As we started to look it up online I noticed that it started to shrink in size suddenly to the size of a distant star and then faded into darkness.  Why were we able to view it for so long sitting in one place, but then it vanishes in 10 seconds from the time that it started to shrink.  We both have very good eye sight.  I thought I'd look up what it was and I found this page.  I spend a lot of time out in the country at night gazing at the stars while out hunting coyotes.  I can tell the difference between a jet, helicopter, ect.  I can't explain this one.   Anyhow, last week while hunting in Laporte, IN, I saw 2 balls of light just like this one over Kingsbury FWA.  I wish I would have ! got pictures.  Oh well.  Anyone else see the light tonight SW of Sturgis, Mi? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
