Colored lights moving quickly across the sky.  ((anonymous report));2016-11-05 23:30:00;15;Colored lights moving quickly across the sky. We were letting dogs out to go to bed.  Noticed one then they started showing up everywhere. Flying fast from west to east.  They flew faster than anything my wife or I know of, they seemed to have several different colored lights.  More than a normal airplane.  They were able to stop in position then move on quickly. Seemed like all the sudden they all disappeared.
