Four Glowing craft in formation near stevensville MI;2011-07-05 22:00:00;1 min;Four Glowing craft in formation near stevensville MI There were four craft that were illuminated, they were in the pattern of the 5 on a dice but missing the bottom left. There was high clouds and they were in the formation below the clouds. We were looking north east over royalton township.  The craft stayed in the formation and were all the exact same distance apart, like the dots on a dice.  My best guess is they would have been near the St. Joseph river. Then the craft in the bottom right moved over directly under the center craft but keeping the same distance.  Now they formed a Y shape and accented up into the sky.  Because of the clouds we lost sight not long after they went into the clouds.  While they accented up into the sky they kept the Y formation and always stayed the same distance apart.  This all took place over a period of time between one or two minuets. Shortly after this happened there was a helicopter that seemed to spend a lot of time flying around the area. Almost as if in a search pattern.  There was also a large number of other aircraft in the sky like commercial jets. About one hour later we seen a large flash of light to the East, like lightning but there was no storms in the area. Im not sure if the flash of light was related to the UFOs.;42.0211;-86.5104
