Diamond shaped abject roughly 5-10 miles off Southwest Michigan over Lake Michigan!!;2019-12-22 19:30:00;30+;Diamond shaped abject roughly 5-10 miles off Southwest Michigan over Lake Michigan!! While walking my dog I noticed a cluster of lights in the distance it looked to be three lights hovering in the same place.  After  observing for quite some time I went inside and grabbed my video camera where I was able to zoom in and snap a picture of the object which appeared diamond and shit from the viewfinder.  I witnessed this object two nights in a row once on December 21 at 7:30 PM and again on December 22 around the same time. both times the object was in the same place for roughly the same time.  That same night I witnessed 910 lights and a half moon shape that other people were witnessing and posting claiming to be satellites.;42.0211;-86.5104
