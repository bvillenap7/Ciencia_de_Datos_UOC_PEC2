Full moon kind of object moving across the sky.;2013-08-13 08:10:00;1 minute;full moon kind of object moving across the sky When I was driving towards east on jolly road, I saw a thing like full moon moving little slower than a plane across the clouds.  First I thought it was a full moon but then I realized it only a half moon phase now.  \ Puzzled about what it could be.   Unfortunately, I could not stop and video tape it.
