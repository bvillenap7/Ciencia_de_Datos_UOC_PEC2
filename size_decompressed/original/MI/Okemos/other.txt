6:00 am in Okemos Michigan;2002-11-18 06:00:00;10 seconds;6:00 am in Okemos Michigan Driving south on hagadron rd towards jolly rd, approaching a stoplight intersection, I couldn't tell if there was an accident ahead, but as I approached the stop, the flashing lights (red,blue,white) where actually about 50 metres placed in the horizon, at about 100-120 meters from me, to the left in a wooden area. When I came to the stop. I could only stare. The lights bounced in that area for several seconds, and then just shot off at a 60 degree angle with a zeeee sound and gone as soon as i saw it. As I continued on my drive I pass the area on the left where i saw this wonderfull display and saw absolutelty nothing in that area. I am 32 yrs, old, maried, three girls. Profesional in an office and that was my first experience.;42.7069;-84.4137999999999
