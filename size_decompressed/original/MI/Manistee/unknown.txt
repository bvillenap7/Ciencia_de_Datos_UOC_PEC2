Mother ship emitting Scout Craft, in sight for about 20 minutes;1974-06-01 23:00:00;15 minutes;Mother ship emitting Scout Craft, in sight for about 20 minutes Working second shift in the cutter shop of Manistee Iron Works, radio station WMTE 1340 of Manistee, mirthfully reported a sighting of a UFO south of town by Canfield Lake, moving toward town at a very slow speed.  Many of us went up on the balcony and opened the windows, to the south of us was a large dark craft, guessing -- it was about 500 feet wide  tip to tip, front to back maybe a 100 feet, there were no lights on the craft, because of the darkness it was very hard to determine a discernable shape, all of a sudden on the tip's of the craft a light came on each tip, shot forward from the mother ship at incredible speed, acceration was as fast or faster than most rockets I have seen, when they reached us both scout ships (as I call them)made a knife edge 90 degree turn to the west and shot out of sight.  Approx 10 minutes later they came back to the mother ship from the north, still very fast, stopped suddenly on the tips of the mother ship, and the lights went out.  We watched the mother ship until it passed overhead, about 20 minutes in all.  Many of the workers punched out of work and follwed in their cars, but not me.

Large, low flying object spotted in Onekama, Manistee and Ludington by many residents on Tuesday 10-29-2013 at 8pm.;2013-10-29 20:00:00;10 minutes;Large, low flying object spotted in Onekama, Manistee and Ludington by many residents on Tuesday 10-29-2013 at 8pm. Watching tv, home alone with my dog.  Dog sits up and is listening to something.  I turn down the tv and immediately hear a low steady hum.  I then am seeing 2 red lights right in front of my house in the air, yet low to the ground and moving slowing west.   We spring to the front door and stand on the steps and watch as this large object moves slowly right in front of me and starts turning south just yards, yards from my house.  The dog is barking like nuts, we run through the house to the back deck and watch as it continues south.  Moving slow and steadily with just a low hum.  One red light on the front and one blinking red light at the rear.   It passed over a tree line on the edge of our property and then I cannot see it anymore.  Heading I thought toward our small airport...following M-22 toward US 31.  Low enough that after it had gotten past the trees, I lost sight of it.  I live in the country, no street lights, there was just a sliver of a moon, no stars--extremely dark of course.  I couldn't make out an exact shape, yet I had this feeling it was huge, possibly the size of a football field.  I couldn't really see the entire object straight on, making me think it was HUGE.  After talking about this all day on Facebook, many people have come forward and had seen the exact same thing.  From Onekama to Manistee to Ludington.  I was so transfixed and in shock and awe, I couldn't even believe what I was seeing with my own eyes.   What the hell was this???  So what is it???  I was unable to get a photo...too dark, too surprised!!!!;44.2634999999998;-86.1825
Saw a hovering object with 3 horizontal lights in the night sky, and it appeared, disappeared, reappeared numerous times.;2017-02-26 21:15:00;20 minutes;Saw a hovering object with 3 horizontal lights in the night sky, and it appeared, disappeared, reappeared numerous times. My husband and I were watching the stars out our bedroom balcony, when a set of strange lights appeared in the distant clear night sky to our west, over Lake Michigan.  The lights appeared quickly, but were too far away to detect the object's shape.  It at times moved slowly up and down, and to one side almost at an angle before returning to its original location.  It would disappear and reappear at least 7 times over the next 20 minutes, always in the same area.  The lights eventually disappeared completely behind the tree line, and we debated back and forth over possible explanations for what we just witnessed.  This object was unlike anything my husband had seen before, but eerily reminded my of a similar unreported event I witnessed alone more than 20 years ago.  We are very curious as to whether we are alone in this sighting or if others witnessed the same. Our background:  Both of us are in our early 40's, and are long-time business professionals and nature/wilderness enthusiasts.  We moved from Southeast Michigan to western Michigan in June of 2016 and recently finished building our dream home on a small inland lake.  We are not extremely religious individuals, nor are we convinced that Aliens exist or visit our planet.  We're skeptical of many and trust only a few, and live our lives according to the Golden Rule.  Hopefully you can offer some insight to what we saw tonight.;44.2634999999998;-86.1825
