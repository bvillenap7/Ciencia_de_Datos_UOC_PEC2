Saw a bright green ball shoot across the sky.;1998-11-27 05:00:00;seconds;Saw a bright green ball shoot across the sky. I was going to work it was just about 5am.  I live 3 block from Lake Michigan.  I was traveling west towards the lake, I stopped for a stop sign, looked left for traffic, instead I saw a bright green ball of light travel across the sky.  It was just above the tree line, it traveled real fast in a straight line, then it stopped, I mean stopped in place imediately. For just a second it remained still in the air, then it shot downward toward the ground.  At that point I lost sight of it beacause of buildings.  I sat there for awhile trying to figure out just what I saw.  But I didn't see it again, I continued on to work.;44.2634999999998;-86.1825
