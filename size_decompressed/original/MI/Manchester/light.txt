Orangish white light;2006-07-13 05:30:00;2 minutes;I don't know if this qualifies as a sighting since I've never seen anything like this before and I only saw lights but here's my description: There was very thick low fog this morning but the full moon was high, clear and visible. I looked to the west to see a clear, bright orangish white light in a stationary position above the tree line. It did not appear to be moving toward or away from me. I have previously lived near Willow Run and Detroit Metro airports and have not seen anything like this before. I could not hear any sound. I went to my basement to retrieve a fan as it was a warm night and is expected to be in the '90's today. When I looked for the light again a couple of minutes later in the west and then in the east it was gone. I then wondered if this may be why my normally quiet inside dog was woofing last night?;42.153;-84.0358
