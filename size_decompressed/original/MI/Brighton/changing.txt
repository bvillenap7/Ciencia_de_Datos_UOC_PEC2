Glittery random lights near each other, really strange stuff;2010-09-09 21:30:00;3-5 minutes;Glittery random lights near each other, really strange stuff I was at work and I've been getting into astronomy lately, so, on a break, I walked outside with my binoculars to search for the dumbell nebula. As I was looking through my binoculars I saw a bunch of separate individual lights that glittered and kept shifting around. All the while I kept trying to debunk it. I thought it might've been a cell tower but it was too high. I just stood there watching the shifting and glittering lights. They would blink off and be in another spot entirely, but in the same vicininty as each other. Wild. I'm not sure what I saw. But, it was definately NOT a reflection of something because the lights where bright in their glitter, sharp and distinct. I do not go out of my way to look for these things. This suprised me.;42.5504578947369;-83.7649263157894
