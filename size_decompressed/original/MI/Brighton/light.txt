High altitude lights traveling due North and due South;2002-08-31 21:20:00;Few minutes;High altitude lights traveling due North and due South This is more of a question than a report.  I have been noticing on several occasions in the late evening, flying crafts traveling either due North or due South at high rates of speed.  They seem to appear at approximately the same times, are at high altitudes, have no flashing lights like commercial airlines, and show no contrails.  Could these be satellites or high flying military flights?  I was told that satellites really don't have high visibility to the naked eye and these are very bright.  Got an idea?  Or are these shuttles to Venus and back - just joking. ((NUFORC Note:  Our guess would be satellites.  PD));42.5504578947369;-83.7649263157894
Fast moving light stops in night sky;2007-07-23 03:30:00;10 to 15 minutes;Fast moving light stops in night sky On July 23, 2007, at approximately 3:30 A.M Eastern, my niece and I were looking at the stars when we noticed a fast moving object that that was streaking from north to south.  We thought it was a satellite or the ISS.  It was a light no bigger or brighter than the stars in the background.  We watched it travel a considerable distance in 6 to 8 seconds, from about the 11 o’clock position until about the 8:40 o’clock position.  We could not tell how high it was, but it abruptly stopped at about a 50 degree angle looking to the west.  It sat there for 10 to 15 minutes and when it didn’t move we went into the house.  There were no contrails or tails and it did not pulse.;42.5504578947369;-83.7649263157894
Odd Bright Orange Object in the sky;2008-07-04 01:15:00;4 Minutes;Odd Bright Orange Object in the sky I was sitting on my deck at about 1:15AM looking west in the nights sky from the deck of my home and saw a bright orange object moveing east slowly for about 2 minutes.  The object then began moving south at the same speed and went out of view due to the roof of my home.  I immediately left my deck of my home to my driveway to get a better look and could not find it.  It was bright orange, not a falling star or commercial aircraft/satelite that I have ever witnessed before in my experience.  It moved like an aircraft much higher in the sky then a normal airplane. When it turned direction it was not a normal turn.  Very very odd.  No sound, no trail, no green or other colors just bright orange. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be flawed, but we cannot be certain.

Orange glowing large object in sky, stationary for a couple of minutes & then moved west;2014-06-28 22:20:00;2 minutes;Orange glowing large object in sky, stationary for a couple of minutes & then moved west The object was large, glowed orange, and was a good distance away in the sky.  It immediately caught my attention because aircraft do not use orange lights.  There was no distinguishable shape from my vantage point.  It sat in the same location for a couple of minutes and then slowly moved west until I could not see it anymore.  It was very evident to my wife as well.  It was NOT a Chinese lantern. This is the 3rd time I have seen a UFO in the last month.  On 2 successive nights I saw a distant glowing, pulsating object due south from the rear window of my home which would put it somewhere near the border of Michigan/Ohio.;42.5504578947369;-83.7649263157894
