7 orange orbs in night sky below cloudline!;2009-08-21 20:53:00;13 minutes;7 orange orbs in night sky below cloudline! We live in Brighton, and was getting on 96 going eastbound.  Once I was on the expressway I looked to my left not to high in the sky and saw 7 orange orbs in sky.  These suckers were big and low to the ground, hovering around 500 to 1,000 feet above the ground, drifting in and out of the clouds passing. There were two groups, one consisted of only three and the other had four in it. Making a total of 7 BIG ORANGE LIGHTS IN THE SKY NOT TOO FAR UP!!  No flares,no trails,no blinking lights,no sound..and they moved eastward and the other group moved north east. Both very slowly and in different directions. It was ODD to say the least! They look liked glowing oranges in the sky and hovered below the LOW cloud line. My first thought was hey maybe they are planes getting ready to land, but no blinking lights, and they looked like HUGE ORANGE ORBS! I dont know what to say, why has this not been talked about yet, many cars pulled over along the roads to see this!;42.5504578947369;-83.7649263157894
