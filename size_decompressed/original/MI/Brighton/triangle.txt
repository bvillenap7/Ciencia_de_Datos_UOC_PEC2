Southeast Michigan UFO flap February 1978;1978-02-09 19:45:00;2 Hours;Southeast Michigan UFO flap February 1978 February 9, 1978 7:45 p.m. Island Lake, Brighton, Michigan  The night of my 10th b-day I witnessed a large triangular shaped object with an oval of lights underneath.  This object flew just above the tree tops and made a low humming noise. I feel there are two points of particular interest regarding this sighting. First, that my brother filmed the object and other strange lights seen that night then immediately drove to the news station in Detroit. My memory fails me at this point but I believe it was channel 7.  The news station aired the film on the eleven p.m. news.  All that was on it were neighborhood dogs he had filmed earlier in the day.  It was made out to be a hoax.  I also seem to remember that it was somehow proven later that the film had been tampered with. Second, that I was interviewed at a later date by Air Force personnel regarding the sighting.  I was alone with the personnel at our kitchen table as I gave my account of the sighting.  I remember being asked to draw a picture which I did.  Other witnesses in my family were also interviewed seperately the same day. I have been searching to no avail regarding the newscast or Air Force report referencing this sighting.  I found one report on this sighting at www.cohenufo.org.;42.5504578947369;-83.7649263157894
