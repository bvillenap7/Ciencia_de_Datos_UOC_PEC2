On October 24th 2019 at 8:04pm I saw a silent craft hovering over a very tall tree across the empty lot from me for 5 minutes.  It had 3 white blinking lights some blinking away different times other times all blinking.  I ran after 5 mintues grabbed my phone and started recording. 51 seconds it came above me had a sound but no wings on craft lights were all blinking white 3 lights in a triangle shape.  I could not get exact shape of craft lights were very bright and it zoomed off and disappeared right in front of me.  My video shows this.   The video quality on my brand btw phone seemed not right not clear.  But it clearly shows object hovering then moving slowly.  It was not a plane or helicopter.  Had no wings either. group.  I have a brief 51 second video but witnessed for 7 minutes total.;42.5504578947369;-83.7649263157894
