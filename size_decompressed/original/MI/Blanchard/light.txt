They accelerate very fast, & brake just the same!  Move weird & come in 3's arranged in a triangle The climax of my first night, and all my other sightings, was when  I was watching six of them and they all moved up at the same time in a very unique way!   I’ve seen these UFO’s 5 different nights now.  I’ve got two other witness’s , and as of now I’ve got about  1 hour of good video tape all together .    Usually when I see them its between 10:30 p.m and 1:00 am eastern time.  They usually appear in threes, and only on the very first night was there ever more than three confirmed moving in the sky in one night.   These UFO’s seem to have intelligent operator’s.  I say this because I’ve went out side twice to try to see them better on the first couple nights but when I went out they became very still, and continued to remain still for 10 mins or so after I went inside my house. To be honest and upfront,  They look and in a sense act like star’s.  That’s the main reason why I said they had intelligent operators! 	 In due time these ufo’s “glide “as I call it across the night sky.  But they don’t only glide!  They make short, very  very  fast jerky movements at times.  I’ve seen them do u turns, complete loops and double loops, sometimes they do pointless maneuvers like,  right-----à left , right---------àLeft, right------à and I’ve seen them do 45 degree turns one right after another, They flicker but usually are the same basic colors of the stars, but the same three seem to keep appearing and one of the three is always a amberish color.  But they have a flicker effect to them that  always catches my eye.  I spotted the very first one only because it was flickering.  They make, what look like very short, fast, and erratic movements, but If your not watching that one target you would never see it moving, But on the other hand, if your only watching the one SO CALLED STAR no human alive would doubt me when it moves !!! 	 I’ve seen them slowly dim out, I’ve seen them flicker what seemed to be, at one another , and then start to flicker in sync.  When they flickered at each other and in sync the did it very brightly, and instead of a flicker,  they kind of flashed. But the night they flickered at one another and in sync was my on first night.   That night I spotted one, then I  identified three, then out of no where three more showed up, and than I was watching multiple targets move at once, since at that time they all moved rather close to each other and grouped up.  That’s around the time they all moved up in a weird fashion “which can be described if asked”   The only time I could really count them was when they all moved weirdly up together.  They would dim down and disappear and reappear out of nowhere.  But when they moved up together , they all stayed lit up, allowing me to count quickly. 	 But the most craziest part is when a bright one, “some are brighter than others” Shot out three more of these ufo’s .  One came out straight down.  Then the other two shot out at a downward 45 degree angle , one on each side.   The climax lasted maybe, 4-8 mins  then if they didn’t dim down and disappear, they moved slowly out of the South East sky, and continued moving to and threw the south southeast sky, until I could not see them no more threw my window.   But , the way they move makes no sense, and the way they accelerate is UNBELIVABLELY fast!!  They seem to be able to stop just as fast as well! 	I have a lot more to say but don’t want to ramble on.  There is so much to gain from what I’m seeing.  I can only hope you take me serious.  I would gladly upload the video I‘ve got but my camcorder use’s 8mm tapes, but I’ve burned it to a dvd+R disc, but I cant get my computer to read it!!!!  I could mail a copy????? When I video taped I opened my window ”even though it was freezing” and removed my screen and video taped while my camera sat completely still!  Some of the video is really convincing!!!   Now, I love outer space and stargazing!  I just turned 29 this year , so for about 15 years now I’ve avidly looked at the sky.  And I wouldn’t be writing this, nore would I have lost any sleep the first night, if I had stopped watching  what I thought might  have been a quasar ‘ which didn’t alarm me until it moved!”, just one second before it started moving.  But when that star/quasar started moving, well lets just say that’s 3 seconds of movement I’ll never forget! I need more and better cameras, I need professionals to see this!!!!!!    Please contact me!!!!!!!!   I don’t want to be famous, I just want the truth !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! P.s I just seen that I can mail my dvd+R disc to you so, I will do so.  And the disc will contain my best 15 seconds and all the footage I can stuff on one disc.  If you can not get it to play, I'm going to use a different burner to copy it, and i will send it again if you have problems ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

I'm still seeing those flickering lights, and according to the reports, I'm not alone!!!  This time the colors are more vivid!!!!;2010-02-18 01:00:00;1 hour;I'm still seeing those flickering lights, and according to the reports, I'm not alone!!!  This time the colors are more vivid!!!! When I got home late from my 2nd shift job, and pulled in my drive way.  I noticed those flickering craft in the clear night sky again!   I have reported these crafts 3 different times to three different organizations! This makes # 4.   But no one will take me serious.   I HAVE VIDEO AND LOTS OF IT, THEREFORE  I HAVE PROOF!!!!  But  these amazing air crafts, just keep showing up!!!!!! I have looked at many reports and to my surprise , A lot of people are reporting the same thing.   Flickering lights that emit multi colors, and then the light orange ones that  don’t  flicker. The light orange ones are different!  They slowly dim down and  move and then slowly light back up.  They  move the same as the flickering ones though!    A LOT OF PEOPLE  ARE SEEING  THE SAME AIR CRAFTS!!!!   From the east coast to the west!!!!  If your reading this please contact me!!!  I will show you!!!!!   EVERY NIGHT THE SKY IS CLEAR THEY ARE THERE!!!  	  Some nights they are more active then others.  And on  02/18/10 they were  active and flickering brighter than ever!!  I’ve seen them so much now that  I  always assume they are there.  And when I look, sure enough there they are!  I always confirm it by waiting for them to move.   I have 6 rough hours of video edited down to 2 hours.  Plus on the 18th of Feb, I taped some more!!!!!!  You can see the movements on tape but its hard to see, because I believe these crafts are hovering possibly outside of our atmosphere.  Making them who knows how far away!!!!   But you can see the movements on tape and a lot easier with the naked eye!!!  On 02/18/10 I had to get out my video camera due to the fact that, I’ve never seen the multi colors so bright and vivid before!  On this night two of them where unusually bright and vivid, and these two looked liked identical twins, both flickering at the same rate and everything!!!!  Then there was 1 normal  whitish one flickering out in th! e distances.   But when I got my wife outside to look she was also surprised that the colors where so noticeable, but then she pointed out that the  orange one that was almost straight above us,  was dimming down.  And when I looked I saw it dim down and  move around  erratically and then stop and brighten up.   Just to repeat its self and dim down again and move.  It did this over and over again.  They  make all kinds of weird turns, stops, loops, dips and zig zags.  There is no craft known by the general public that is capable of what they do.  I have lots of theories about  who they are and what there doing , and  how they do what they do.   But I need help bringing this to light!!!!!!!  I need more witnesses, and a lot better camera!!!!!    WE NEED TO BELIEVE AND HAVE FAITH IN EACH OTHER!!!!!!!!!         I would really love to  meet up with anyone  and show them what I’m seeing.   I promise ,  you will believe me if you allow me to show you!!!!!!!!!!!!               Ple! ase contact me!!!!!;43.5209;-85.0561
