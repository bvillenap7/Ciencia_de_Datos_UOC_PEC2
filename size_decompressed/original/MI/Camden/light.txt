A brilliant orange light in the sky at 1AM.;2015-12-15 01:00:00;20 minutes +/-;A brilliant orange light in the sky at 1AM. I was driving home when I noticed a bright orange light near the horizon of the western sky.  I live in the country, so it is not possible that the light could be from a city.  The light would grow brighter and larger in size, then would fade a bit and become smaller.   My cell phone camera was all I had on hand, and unfortunately it does not take great night shots.;41.7394;-84.7268
