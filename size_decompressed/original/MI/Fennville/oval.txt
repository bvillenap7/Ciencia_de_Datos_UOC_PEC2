UFO sighting in Michigan sky.;2012-06-08 22:45:00;1 minute;UFO sighting in Michigan sky. My husband had just pulled in the driveway from work at 22:40 he called me from the car saying he was home.  I overheard him say what's that?  I didn think anything of it.   He hung up and I heard him come through the door.  He was in a rush and yelled for me to come outside.  We live in the country so our vision of the night sky is phenomenal.   I proceed to run out doors on our front step. I saw what he was pointing at immidiantly.  It was a red ball which at first I said oh that's mars.  Then as I watched the object glide across the sky I realized that was a UFO.  It turned from red to orange. I ran inside to get my parents and when I came out it  disappeared.  My husband said that when he watched it fade away it looked as if it was leaving out of our solar system.  We have not seen anything since.;42.5777;-86.1249
