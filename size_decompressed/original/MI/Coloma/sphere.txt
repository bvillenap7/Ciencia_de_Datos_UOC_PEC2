As I reported to the NUFORC on Saturday night having spoken with Peter Davenport:  At approximately 22:57, 24 August, 2013, inside the city limits of Coloma, Michigan, 49038, on 459 Park Street, in a grass alley behind the house, outside of the old motorhome I live in, I went outside to retrieve a crate & bag of cat food from a storage shed.   				I was facing due North at 00 Degrees Azimuth & out of the corner of my right eye I looked up and saw a large Orange Ball-Shaped Object moving at a slow speed toward the 00 Degrees Azimuth.  I walked to my right to get better look outside of the branches of a large tree & saw 2 more Orange Spheres in  line with the 3rd.  They were moving rather slowly, like a Gaggle of Helicopters would travel, approximately 500 feet  Above Ground Level.	 		At the time, the Moon had risen to about 135! Degrees Angle & the Orange Spheres were each about the size of one-tenth of the rising Moon.    The 3 Orange Spheres were also giving out a light similar to a multi-pointed Star.    							                                                                                                                  					  As I watched, I walked forward on the grass alley and with awe & amazement, I kept saying out loud, “Oh, My Gosh! Oh, My Gosh! Oh, My Gosh!   Oh, My  Gosh!”      	                       		                                                                            							  The first of the 3 Spheres, went out & I saw a Star in the distant which went out. The 2nd & the 3rd Spheres seemed to stop moving for about 10 seconds & then proceeded to follow the 1st Sphere & the 2nd Sphere went out & the 3rd Sphere went out.  There was no sound emitted from the Crafts. Maybe traveling about a 100 Knots per Hour?                                                           		     							I was so e xcited!  I called a TV station in Chicago, which is quite progressive, but was put on hold then disconnected 3 times. I asked before the fourth if I should call back the next day, & was told “Yes.”  I then called the Berrien County Sheriff’s Office who did not know what to think of me. I asked for the telephone number to the Michigan State Police & after 3 different officers, last being a shift Capt., with the same disinterest. I did ask if they received any more reports to let me know……                                       									 I then went inside my motorhome & looked up a reporting center for UFO’s & found this one & called & spoke with Peter Davenport.  He told me that he had just received reports from 2 other callers before me.  Asked if I was near Detroit, Michigan. I said no, I was on the other side of the state.  Being about 22 miles direct north of Indiana & about 90 miles from Chicago.  I am about 5 miles East of Lake Michigan.   						I consider myself to be very! fortunate for this experience.  Just the previous day I had watched a program on satellite dish about Area 15 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, just North of Dayton, at Fairborn, Ohio.  I had worked there in the 1980’s as a Crew Chief Aircraft Mechanic on F-4D’s.   I am retired from the USAF as a Tech Sergeant Aircraft Mechanic.  I hold an FAA  A & P License.  I also hold a Student Pilot’s License.  I have been afforded 4 rides on attack & fighter aircraft.  The A-37 side seat & F-4D rear cockpit seat, twice each.   So I know a bit about aircraft.;42.203;-86.3225
