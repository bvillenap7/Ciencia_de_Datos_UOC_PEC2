Green/yellowish light on saucer object  moving south to north in Southeastern Mich.;2001-06-16 23:30:00;2min;Green/yellowish light on saucer object  moving south to north in Southeastern Mich. At around 2330 on 6/16/01 I took my two dalmations out for a brief walk. I live on a corner lot next to a large park. I was standing at the corner waiting for my dogs to catch up, when I saw what I thought was a lightning bug across the street at the park. I followed this green/ yellowish light as it went streight up slowly. When I first saw it, the light was already above the tree line, so I could'nt tell how close it was. I thought it odd that it was'nt flickering, just getting smaller. Then the light started moving south to north. I never heard a sound as it flew its course. I thought it must be a heliocopter and did'nt take my eyes off of it because I thought it was interesting that I could'nt hear it yet. As it got midway between the park and my house I could tell that it was not assending any longer and I could see some reflection from the city lights on the underside of the craft. It's then when I could'nt belive what I was seeing. I saw a round saucer shape with only one green yellowish light at the rear of the object. As it went north iI was able to follow it north untill it slowly went out of sight. I thought to myself, Did I just see what I thought I saw! I could not tell how high the craft was, how fast it was moving, or hear any sound at all. I do know that the cloud deck that night was around 8000 ft ASL. and winds aloft were less than 5 knots. The craft never went behind the clouds the whole time that I saw it, so I know it was under 8000 ft. I,ve never seen anything like this before....Ever!;42.4681;-83.1882
