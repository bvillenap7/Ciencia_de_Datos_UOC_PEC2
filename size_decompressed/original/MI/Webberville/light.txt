Bright light hovering over Williamston Michigan;2002-02-13 23:00:00;5 Min;Bright light hovering over Williamston Michigan At approx 23:00 I witnessed an extremely bright yellow/white light hovering above the ground, it appeared to be above the Williamston, MI about 4-5 miles west of me, and 1 mile above the ground. I stopped to get a better look at the light, and watched it for about 3 or 4 minutes, and then it started heading east at a high rate of speed. Within about 1 minute it was out of my sight. It made no noise, and the light was still visible when it was to the east of me. I found out later that other people in the area witnessed the same event, and that it was broadcast on a Detroit news station as government testing.;42.6614;-84.1712
