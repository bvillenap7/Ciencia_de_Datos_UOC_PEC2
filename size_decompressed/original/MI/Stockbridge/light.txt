Glowing ball of light that changed in color and bounced around.;2015-04-26 00:00:00;4 hours;it was like a glowing ball of light that changed in color and bounced around Ok, so this was the second time this week.. decided to call my boyfriend over.  While I waited for him i kept on video recording this weird light in the sky.  At first sight you would think it to be an airplane.  But i am a believer and i watch when i see something. so it did not glide through the sky as an airplane would. it was shimmering, bright, round light that was like a white light. this object was fluttering around, side to side and up and down, stay still and it was just bouncing about in smaller motions.  By the time my boyfriend got here it was a lot duller in color almost orangish light but it was almost not visible. then my boyfriend and i watched it bounce above the tree line and slowly and surely made it below the trees where it was unseen for about one hour.  Then it came back out but at that time it was behind a tree, i think it left shortly after;42.4623;-84.1683
