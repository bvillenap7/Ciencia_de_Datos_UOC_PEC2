Sometimes farmers go into the baseball fields by our house so I originally thought it was flashing brake lights. When I got home I decided to take a walk and just see what it was. This object was hovering about 30 to 40 feet in the air head to glowing red rectangles pulsating a red flash repeatedly. The area was so completely dark I was not able to truly see the shape of the objects the long rectangular lights were attached to. When I saw these lights were not brake lights and in fact a true UFO hovering above the septic tanks of her outdoor bathrooms at the high school I became to panic and full of fear and decided to leave the area.  Our family has asked locals about The occurrence but there is truly no explanation. We have been walking back every night to see if there would be the same object but there hasnâ€™t been.;42.4623;-84.1683
