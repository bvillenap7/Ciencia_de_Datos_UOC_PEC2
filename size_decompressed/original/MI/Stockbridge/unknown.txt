a point of light that looked like what might be a satellite traveling from north to south;2008-08-20 21:50:00;5-10 sec;Looking up I noticed a point of light that looked like what might be a satellite traveling from north to south…. I pointing up, yelling.. “Look, look look” trying to bring to the attention of my son and wife. Just then the object seem to get bigger and brighter but only for a second or so. Now the object still seemly moving from north to south but now it’s traveling out bound and the point of light fade to nothing… all this with a 5 to 10 second time frame.  I believe that the bigger and bright image I witnessed would be the results of a firing of a engine of some sort.  My wife did not seem any thing and my 11-year-old son said that he did see it too.;42.4623;-84.1683
