In the southern sky I saw what appeared to be a shooting star. I said look to my son. He looked and saw what I did. The star-like object then completely reversed course and went back the same way it came at an amazing speed. It then began to make manuevers that could not have been accomplished by any known craft which was man-made. It did circles and sudden starts and stops at sharp but regular angles. This was all done at a speed which was unbelievable. It then sped away a long distance until no longer visible. My son was frightened and went inside. I am now a believer. I tried to explain it to myself but I know what I saw. It was not a spotlight,plane,lightning bug,falling star etc. If the object was man-made then we have learned to defy all laws of physics and have secret aircraft. This object was real,was under control, but performed manuevers normally thought impossible.;43.645;-85.0017
