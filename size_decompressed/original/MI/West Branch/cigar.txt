My partner exclaimed that the moon appeared cracked. The full moon was about 30 degrees above the horizon in the Eastern sky. It was daylight and the sky was clear. The object completely bisected the moon horizontally at midpoint making the moon appear split. The object appeared in the vicinity of the moon and would have to have been about 3500 kilometers long by 100 kilometers high. The object remained in the same trajectory as it appeared to move downward against our view of the moon and parallel to it. As it moved down from the face of the moon, the object was no longer visible. It appeared as a line completely bisecting the moon from mid-point moving to the bottom of the moon's face in about 6 seconds time or appearing to move over 200 km per second.;44.2808;-84.2249
stationary object with many lights hovering next to i75;2010-02-12 20:30:00;3 min.;stationary object with many lights hovering next to i75 Driving north on I75 at mile marker 200 12 miles south of west branch, MI, 8:30 pm feb. 12 2010 I had a strong feeling of something getting ready to happen and thoughts of a UFO.   After this a few miles down the road, there were bright lights east of the freeway.  My wife was driving our suv and saw the craft as well.  She thought it may be a radio tower.  The object was about ¼ to ½ mile from the freeway and about 1,000 feet up.  I would say 3 times the height of a tower.   It was clearly a craft there was no discernable fuselage, wings or rotor. It appeared in the shape of a football, and I could see into it enough to see more lights. There were 2 very bright white lights and numerous smaller lights within the craft of other colors.  I rolled down the window as we passed and took a good look.  The craft was so stationary that it was very peculiar.;44.2808;-84.2249
