While she was wandering, I was looking up at the night sky and noticed 2 stars moving quite fast, side by side with an off set. So I ran and grabbed my phone to try to Video tape it, if it Happens again.  Because I know they're not stars.  It did Happen again 5 more times. As these things are moving they get real bright {its quite amazing} and then dim low again.                                                                        I saw 1 of them light up into a Triangle with bright lights kind of like a strobe.                                                                                I Believe that I saw the Mother Ship, It looked like a big circle all lit up with a smaller circle at the bottom all lit up when it Strobe'd.                      It strobe'd 2 times . They all came from the same place and disappeared at same place. I did take 5 Videos .;42.649465;-83.28961
