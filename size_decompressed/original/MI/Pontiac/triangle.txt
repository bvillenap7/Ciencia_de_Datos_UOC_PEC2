January 29, 2016, 11:55pm, I was on the corner of Walton and Baldwin, waiting on a traffic signal,  I noticed very bright lights just above the trees heading north on Walton.  This aircraft had 7 lights visible from the front of it, and made no noise.  I realized whatever this aircraft was, it was headed right for me, and I began to panic thinking it was going to crash down on top of me.   When the aircraft got to Baldwin, it turned gracefully going towards I75, this is when I seen the whole aircraft.  It was triangular, it had very bright lights on each corner and smaller lights going down each side, 9 lights total. It was gliding very low and very slow as it went on its way.   I did not follow it because it frightened me, and I did not report this incident because basically every one I told laughed at me.;42.649465;-83.28961
