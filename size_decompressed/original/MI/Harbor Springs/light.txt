Just an interesting sighting, wondering if others saw the same thing.;45.526;-85.0007

The object disappeared behind a small low drifting cloud about the size of a large house. By all experience and reason the object should have re-appeared in two seconds after passing behind the cloud. It did not...to my great puzzelment.;45.526;-85.0007
