Bright objects swarming in the sky.  ((anonymous report));2016-12-27 01:00:00;10 seconds;Bright objects swarming in the sky While closing up for the night, I was in the backyard and I happened to look up at the stars. They were very bright and luminous.  Just then, while gazing at the stars, 6 or 7 bright objects began to appear and swarm around eachother slightly above to the west.  They began moving in an erratic pattern to the east, juggling and swarming among each other.  They finally faded into the starry background out of view, toward the east side of the sky.
