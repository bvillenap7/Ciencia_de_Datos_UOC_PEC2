My husband was outside moving our cars and he looked up and a orange circle appeared. He thought it was a firework but it never went off. He ran inside to get me to come outside. I went outside and saw this circular glowing object it seemed to go fast at first then slowed down as it went across the sky until it was to far to see. I wanted to go get my video camera but I didn't want to miss anything. I regret it know.;42.4638;-83.1015
First I saw two bright orange objects moving high in the sky.  At first I thought they were drones.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-14 21:55:00;5 minutes;First I saw two bright orange objects moving high in the sky.  At first I thought they were drones.  They could have been.  But then one light went out and the next went out not long after the first.  I thought, ok, maybe these are police drones, or something along those lines.   Then I kept looking in the sky as it was odd.  A few minutes later I noticed a white circular object floating through the sky at a low altitude with no lights.  It was definelty weird.  No sound and it was moving pretty fast.  Again, could have mistaken drones for UFOs, but never seen drones like this experience.  Couldn't have been the only person in the area to have seen the orange orbs in the sky.  Thanks. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
