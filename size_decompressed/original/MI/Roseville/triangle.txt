I don't know what drew my attention upwards, but despite the fact that there were hundreds of other students around, no one else seemed to be looking up.  I saw what appeared to be a very large, trangular aircraft.  What interested me was the fact that it appeared to be flying at an extremely high altitude, yet nonetheless appeared extremely large.  It was all black and a perfect triangular shape.  While I didn't know this at the time, it looked just like the modern stealth B-52 bomber. I listened and could not hear a typical jet engine sound.  It was silent.  It was also moving very slowly.  I saw what appeared to be windows on the bottom of this craft though they could have been tiles.  I watched for about a minute until the bell rang and I had to go to class.  I questioned what I had seen and frankly was embarassed to tell anyone else about it because I thought that they would have made fun of me for certain.  It was all I could think about all day.  The strange part occurred when I got home from school that afternoon.  After I had convinced myself that all I saw was a plane and that my imagination had gotten the better of me, I spotted the Detroit Free Press.  On the front page was a black and white photograph of four or five triangle shaped lights taken by someone in Michigan the night before.  The headline proclaimed that these were unidentified flying objects.  This was too much to be a coincidence.  However, I remained reluctant to tell anyone what I saw becuase I was certain they would have thought I was making it all up.  It haunted me for some time.  However, upon the unveiling of the stealth B-52 Bomber, I realized that most likely what I had seen was a prototype of the stealth or the actual stealth before it was ultimately unveiled to the public.

About 6 more single orange lights trailed the first group about 10-30 seconds apart, following the same path.   Duration of observation was about 10-15 minutes.

So I was driving home I saw this white light in the sky, at first I thought it was a star or maybe a helicopter but as I continued to observe it and got closer i saw the lights one bright light in the middle but faint lights on the corners of this triangle-like thing in the sky. I was tempted to record the thing but I was driving and was kinda in shock I guess, only got a view of it as it was passing above me kinda all I could see was it was it was triangle-like and had white lights on it and when I decided to turn around to confirm what I had seen (which was at most 3 minutes) and it was gone, no sight of the thing.;42.5138;-82.9396
