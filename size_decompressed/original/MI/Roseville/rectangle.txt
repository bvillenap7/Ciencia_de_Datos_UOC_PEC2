To whom this may concern:  On the evening of 20th June 2009 a friend and I were talking in my back yard when I saw a shining light in the western sky, there was cloud cover and the wind was blowing around 10-15 miles an hour, moving from west to east. This object was rectangle in shape and standing on end, moving at around half the speed of a normal sized two setter prop plan and was traveling east to west, it would get really bright then back to silver like color, it did this the whole time we viewed it. I know what satellites look like at night as well as flares at dusk plus this was below the clouds and the clouds appeared to be at about 3000-4000 ft. I was thinking it was a balloon but how could it get so shinny on a cloudy day not to mention move against the wind??? Then the strangest thing happened and this is why I’m emailing this report… the object just stopped in mid air and hovered for about 30-45 seconds b/4 the clouds covered it…. I’ve never seen anything like this b/4 as I’m an amateur astronomer now for about 30 years and have seen some cool stuff out there b/4 but NEVER LIKE THIS!!!!!;42.5138;-82.9396
