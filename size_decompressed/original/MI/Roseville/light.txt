It stayed there for about five minutes and it took off in a big flash of white light. We were in my pool in my backyard when we seen the object. It was a weird kind of oval shape. It kind of resembled an egg. The color was a bluish-silver and after it took off the flash of light was almost blinding. There is a couple of trees in my backyard and it was dark outside.;42.5138;-82.9396
A bright light in the sky, Roseville, Michigan 48066 @ approx 8:48 pm est.;2011-07-30 20:48:00;about 3 minutes;A bright light in the sky, Roseville, Michigan 48066 @ approx 8:48 pm est. It was approximately 8:48 pm est on july 30 2011.  We (1 other adult and a 11 year old girl) were swimming in the pool and then a bright light was seen in the sky by the 11 yaer old,, when I looked up at it it was very bright and was about the size of an eraser head on a pencil, it was just so still in the sky,   I was thinking at first it may have been a satellite but there were no other lights or stars in the CLEAR BLUE SKY!!,  It was all by itself, it was there approximately 2-3 minutes then it just shot straight up faster than anything that i have ever seen,faster than a rocket launch!!!!   It was incredible to watch with my eyes, until I could just barely see a very dim light and then it just dissappered! I see planes all the time in the sky at cruising altitude and can make them out, this was something that was ay up in the sky and for me to have seen it I believe it was very large!

Blue,red and green object dancing around while changing colors.;2011-08-17 22:00:00;5 mins?;Blue,red and green object dancing around while changing colors. I was on my way to work around 2150 going southbound M-97. As I got closer to an intersection I noticed a blue starlike object in the sky.  But it was to low to be a star. As I came closer to the area I noticed it was dropping down.  It dipped below some trees and buildings for a moment then rose back up and started to dance around the general area but never moved out of that particular area.  As I came to the stop light I was able to get a better look and it was moving erratically around while changing colors blue/red and green.  At one point it appeared to have a cigar like look to it when it danced around.   The traffic light changed and I proceded down M-97.  I thought it maybe some kind of new remote control toy aircraft or something but when I first noticed it it was about 200 ft in the air.  There were lots of people still out so hopefully someone else saw it too.;42.5138;-82.9396
