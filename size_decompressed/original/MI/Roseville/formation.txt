Bright lights dancing in the night sky;2004-08-04 22:00:00;5 min;Bright lights dancing in the night sky I was sitting in the backyard at my firepit approx. 10:00 at night. Some distant lights caught my eye. Though far away the lights were quite bright. Unlike aircraft they were moving about independently, up and down and at angles, and in circular motions. There appeared to be 3 white lights which would fade to a blueish color [also independently] around a reddish,orange center light. Since I was the only one to see it I kept it to myself. However the next morning I heard on the radio that others had seen similar lights very early that next morning in what would've been the same basic area. [I94/I275] The radio station was 104.3 FM and if memory serves there also a brief mention on the TV news, channel 2. At the end they seemed to come together into a single bright light and took off at a high rate of speed and dissappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.5138;-82.9396
