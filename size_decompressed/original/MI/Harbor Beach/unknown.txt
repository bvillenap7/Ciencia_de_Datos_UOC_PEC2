Well it was early in teh morning and the sky was kinda of hazy when nature called so i had to get up to go use teh bathroom. THen i looked out the window and there in the sky was this blinking light that was floating in teh sky and it was kinda of going around in circles. I thought it culd have ben a lightning bug but it was much bigger, it had sortk of a purple colored blinking light.;43.8296;-82.6923
