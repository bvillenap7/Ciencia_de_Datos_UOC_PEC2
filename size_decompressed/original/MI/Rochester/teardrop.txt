Unusual aircraft captured by video;2020-03-08 18:41:00;1 minute;Unusual aircraft captured by video I was taking a photograph of the sunset when I saw something in the left corner.  After I took the picture I looked to the sky and it disappeared.  The picture was live so I turned it into a video image and have emailed this for you to look at.  I’m not sure what it is but the way it moved when I wasn’t moving the camera was strange and lights lit up on it, and there’s some strange movement underneath it telling me it was a reflection in the lens.;42.6791258064515;-83.1501148387097
