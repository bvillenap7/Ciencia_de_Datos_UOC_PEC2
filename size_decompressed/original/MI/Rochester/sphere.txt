Silver Sphere Ufo;2021-05-15 23:30:00;3 minutes;Silver Sphere Ufo This morning around 11:30 I seen a silver, spherical shaped UFO. As I was walking out of my house, I noticed a dot in the sky with clouds behind it. At first, I thought it was a bird extremely high up in the air, but as it continued to move straight forward at high speeds, the sunlight caught its reflection and it shined a bright flash of light, which further drew my attention to it. This is when I realized it was spherical and silver, although it also seemed to be reflecting the light surrounding it. It had to be at least 15-20,000 ft high. I continued to observe it while walking to my car, which was facing the direction it was coming from. It continued to move straight forward at a high speed. As I got into my car, it made a sudden vertical shot upwards, with a blurry kind of hue surrounding it. It was no longer visible because of how high up it was. There was no noise during this sighting.;42.6791258064515;-83.1501148387097
