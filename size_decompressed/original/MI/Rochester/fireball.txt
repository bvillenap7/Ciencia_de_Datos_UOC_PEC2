Fireball in the Sky;2010-07-17 22:00:00;15 to 45 minutes;Fireball in the Sky It was approximately 10:00 pm eastern time.  My wife and I decided to take a night walk, with our kids (10 and 2), into town. As we walked south, through a parking lot, we (my wife, daughter, and myself) noticed a fireball way up in the south sky.  It was heading in an eastwardly direction at about the speed of a jet liner at around 30,000 feet.   At first we thought it was an airplane out of Detroit Metro Airport, but it started to get brighter and then dim again. The longer we watched it the more we realized it was not an airplane.  It was too much like a fireball. It didnâ€™t leave any kind of streak or trail.  It was almost like something was burning up while entering the atmosphere.   I tried to take a picture, or video, with my iPhone but it was not visible on the screen when I tried. We assumed it would be on the news when we got home, or on the internet (news) the next day, but we found no stories about it.;42.6791258064515;-83.1501148387097
