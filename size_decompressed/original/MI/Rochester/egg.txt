I was walking my neighbors dog.  It was still light out at 8:10pm eastern time or 20:00, with a blue sky and a few scattered clouds.  I looked up at the sky as I do often and noticed a object very high, flying from west to east. At first I thought it was a plane or even a drone.  The more I looked I noticed there was no noise, no engine sound, no contrail, and no chemtrail.  It was silent. I kept watching and I realized planes and drones are not egg or tic tac shaped.  It was all bright white.  Not lit up white but just white like a tic tac.  No lights at all.  The object flew straight, west to east, no zig zagging, or turns. It suddenly disappeared into a clear sky as if it there one second and gone the next. I'm not even sure what I saw, but I know for sure it wasn't a plane.;42.6791258064515;-83.1501148387097
