Fireball over Monroe Co, MI;2010-07-20 22:00:00;10 minutes;Fireball over Monroe Co, MI We were driving North on Lewis Ave when I noticed two women looking and pointing up into the sky south of town.   I looked out the car window and saw a orange red fireball!   It looked like a meteorite heading right towards us. The flames were visible.  It was at that point a basketball size.  It was flying north at a downward angle.  It looked like it was right over us.  It then appeared smaller as it turned and leveled out north then suddenly it went East and disappeared.   We got back into the car and headed North.  I looked out again and it reappeared over town again.  We turned the car around and headed South see it, but it disappeared again.   I thought that it was a meteorite or even an Iraq missile headed towards us.  I have never seen anything like it before.   My son and his girlfriend have been watching the fireballs for the past 3 nights over Ida.  Monroe, Co Michigan.;41.8566;-83.5875
