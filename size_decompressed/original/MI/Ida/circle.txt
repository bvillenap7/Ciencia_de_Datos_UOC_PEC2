I went to my bathroom window to see if I could view it and saw what looked to be an aircraft on fire. I ran and grabbed my cellphone and started filming. My son came into the bathroom and saw it as well. We then ran outside to film. The moon was overhead and the object that was to the north was gone. Here is a link to the video I captured:  https://youtu.be/6x0YqsvREY0;41.8566;-83.5875
