7 Adults Witness very large white/yellow glowing objects near the moon on July 4, 2011;2011-07-04 21:45:00;5-8 minutes;7 Adults Witness very large white/yellow glowing objects near the moon on July 4, 2011 On July 4, 2011, at approximately 9:45 pm we were getting ready to watch fireworks, when I looked to the West toward the direction of the moon and saw 3 very large circular lights located to the right of the moon.  The lights were much too large to be stars and they were extremely bright for 1-2 minutes and would then fade to nothing.   The lights would then appear again about a minute later and would be as bright as when we originally witnessed them.  They did appear to remain in the same general location in the sky, but they moved up and down slightly.  There did not appear to be any sideways movement witnessed.  We also did not see flashing colored lights as with an airplane or helicopter.   These were bright yellow/white glowing objects.  We do live near a Nation Guard Base, but the flight path is in the opposite direction and the aircraft flown from this base do not exhibit the behavior witnessed.   There were 7 adults and 1 child that witnessed the lights and none of us could figure out what we were witnessing, except that they were not stars or aircraft.   Three of the adults present were managers, two adults were skilled trade workers, and the other two adults were college students.;42.7019;-82.6741
