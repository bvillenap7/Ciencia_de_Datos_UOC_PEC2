30 to 40 dots moving from west to north east over 4 minutes  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-10-15 06:30:00;4 minutes;30 to 40 dots moving from west to north east over 4 minutes I was getting ready to go hunting in Irons lake Co Michigan about 6:30am and when I went out side I look to the north and seen a line of dots moving from the west to the north east. I went back in and told my brother. He came out and he seen the line of white dots moving also. I have seen Satellites before (1 or 2 at a time) but never 30 or 40 of them in a line moving like that.;44.0949;-85.939
