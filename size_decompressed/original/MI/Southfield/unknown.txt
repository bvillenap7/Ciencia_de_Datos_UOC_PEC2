Was letting my dog outside when I looked up I'm the sky to look at the stars, when I noticed an object that seemed to flare up a bright white light and dim real quick.   Then I noticed another object traveling the same direction at the same speed.  No blinking lights, I quickly eliminated airplane.   And what made me scratch my head was an airplane was flying next to the two objects.;42.4806893750002;-83.2375246875004
