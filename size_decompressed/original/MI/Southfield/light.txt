Slow moving extremely bright white light, bright enough to hurt your eyes, rapidly changing to low density light while still moving.;1999-08-27 20:58:00;1 minute;Slow moving extremely bright white light, bright enough to hurt your eyes, rapidly changing to low density light while still moving. While outside watering my flowers just before 9:00pm EDST, I happened to look up and see a slowly moving extremely bright white light approximately twice the size of Jupiter. The light was so intense, it hurt my eyes to look at it. After 30 seconds it suddenly reduced its brightness immediately to that equal to Jupiter and slowly started to fade as it moved slowly from the Northwest to the Southeast. The very strange thing was that it was so bright that when it changed intensity, a residue or pale glow of light surrounded the oject while it moved and then faded out of sight.;42.4806893750002;-83.2375246875004
Extremly bright white light (strong enough to hurt your eyes) twice the size of Venus or Jupiter, moving slowly from NWest to SWest dir;1999-08-27 20:58:00;50 seconds;Extremly bright white light (strong enough to hurt your eyes) twice the size of Venus or Jupiter, moving slowly from NWest to SWest direction. After approx. 20 seconds it instantly shut down, temporarily leaving a white radiance behind where the bright light was, changing to brightness of a regular star as it slowly moved and faded out of sight in the Southwest. While watering my flowers outside just before 9:00pm EDST I happened to look directly up at the sky and saw an extremly bright white light. The light was so strong it hurt my eyes. It was twice the size of Venus or Jupiter, moving slowly from the NorthWest to the SouthEast direction directly overhead. After approx. 20 seconds it instantly shut down, and changed to emitting light like Venus while still moving slowly to the SouthEast. This action left a temporary pale white radiance surrounding the light it was now emitting as the object slowly moved. The weather was warm, I saw no clouds and no moon in the sky at the time. As it slowly moved, it began to slowly fade in intensity until it was gone. The entire sighting was very short less than a minute. Approximately three months ago I saw something similar, the object was slowly moving from East to West. The brightness was that of a small star. It caught my eye because of its slow movement and it too, gradually faded in br! ightness until I could no longer see it. There were no clouds in the area and I do not remember if there was a moon that night. It was shortly after sunset, but before 9:30pm EDST.;42.4806893750002;-83.2375246875004
Two ufos in the sky initially, then they separated and one appeared out of nothing next to one of them.;2010-10-20 04:20:00;13 minutes;Two ufos in the sky initially, then they separated and one appeared out of nothing next to one of them. I was about to go to bed when I noticed some funky lights in the sky.  I saw two UFOs in the sky a few feet away from each other.  They were maybe several hundred feet away from my bedroom window and one had lights dancing around it like they were chasing each other .  The crafts didn't have any sound.  Next, they began to move away from each other and then the one that was traveling in the SE direction...get this, one APPEARED out of nothing and traveled alongside it, very slow, but closer to me.  Then to add to the awkwardness, a star shot past them both. This all happened between 4:20am and 4:33am.;42.4806893750002;-83.2375246875004
Large bright white/blue light travelling across the sky in a downward trajectory;2017-01-08 06:30:00;15 seconds;Large bright white/blue light travelling across the sky in a downward trajectory I saw a large blue/white light traveling across the sky around 6:30am.  I was driving westbound on 696, getting off to go north on Telegraph, and saw a bright white/blue light streaking from right to left across my windshield.  It looked like a meteor to me because it was traveling incredibly fast and was heading downwards and there was no sound whatsoever.  The object appeared to be a few miles away and started at about 1000 ft and then continued downward on an angle.  I was expecting some sort of impact but when it got to about 250 ft from the ground the light disappeared (and did not move behind any building).  The light seemed to shut off and whatever it was seemed to stop moving and dimmed out to the same brightness as a star.  After that I did not see anything else.;42.4806893750002;-83.2375246875004
