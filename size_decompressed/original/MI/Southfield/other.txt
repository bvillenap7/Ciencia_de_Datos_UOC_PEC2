I HAVE NEVER HEARD A SOUND LIKE THIS COMING FROM THE SKY;2002-11-10 05:32:00;5 secs?  more or less;I HAVE NEVER HEARD A SOUND LIKE THIS COMING FROM THE SKY I was awaken by my daughter. Once I went to her and then returned to my room I heard a loud, wierd, noise over head ( above the roof of my house) that I have  NEVER HEARD BEFORE IN MY LIFE IN THE SKY. The sound had two sounds with it at the same time, neither of which sounded like airplanes flying over head. When I looked out my windows to see anything, I saw nothing. Please explain to me what this could have been. Thank you, ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what they heard.  PD));42.4806893750002;-83.2375246875004
