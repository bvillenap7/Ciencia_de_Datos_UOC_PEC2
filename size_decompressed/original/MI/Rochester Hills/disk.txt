UFO MICHIGAN;1974-08-29 22:00:00;5 minutes;UFO MICHIGAN MY DAD WAS SITTING OUTSIDE WHEN HE CAME RUNNING IN TO THE HOUSE YELLING FOR EVERYONE TO COME OUT QUICK.  WE RAN OUT AND HE POINTED ABOVE THE TREES ABOUT 200 FEET AWAY. ABOUT 30 FEET IN THE AIR WAS A CRAFT MOVING VERY,VERY SLOW AND SPINNING SLOW ALSO.  IT CAME TO A STOP EXCEPT IT WAS STILL SPINNING. WE HEARD A COUPLE OF JETS COMING AND THE CRAFT TILTED A LITTLE AND SHOT AWAY AT GREAT SPEED.  NOTHING WE HAD COULD MOVE THIS FAST. I HAD BEEN IN THE ARMY AIR CORP TWO YEARS BEFORE. AND NEVER SAW ANYTHING MOVE LIKE IT DID. IT NEVER EVER MADE A SOUND THE WHOLE TIME. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.6626;-83.1837
Pulsating orange lights that extinguished, revealing humming gray discs.;2012-09-12 21:30:00;8 minutes;pulsating orange lights that extinguished, revealing humming gray discs. At approximately 9:30 EST in Rochester Hills, Mi I witnessed an orange pulsating light rising from the SW horizon.  At first it looked to me like a paper lantern, so I got the attention of my husband and his parents.  After watching it, we decided it was moving too fast to be a lantern.  We watched the light for about 30 seconds and the light extinguished, then a dull gray light appeared in its place and zoomed silently across the sky over the house, too high up to see a specific shape. About five minutes later, we spotted two more orange glowing objects coming from the same direction. We watched these larger lights as they approached much lower than the previous one, and they flickered out, revealing two gray disc-shaped objects.  They made a strange humming sound as they passed overhead, one moving faster, and then the other one pulling ahead, almost playfully. As the second pulled away, the first one stopped and hovered over the tree line for about 15 seconds and followed the other heading NE. My mother-in-law called my sister-in-law who lives about 3 miles from us and told her about what we saw. When she stepped out onto her deck, she saw two of the glowing orange spheres, but they never got close enough for her to see the shape, although she did hear the hum.  She was on the phone with us while she was witnessing the objects.;42.6626;-83.1837
Flying object saucer shape with red and green lights seen in Rochester Hills, MI;2016-07-04 22:20:00;10;Flying object saucer shape with red and green lights seen in Rochester Hills, MI Object had 4 lights - 3 red and one green.  Green light blinked constantly.  At some time all started to blink and turned of except one red, then all turned back again. I t was moving very fast (much faster then plain or helicopter) and between movements it froze in the sky at the spot.  Moved to different directions left and right, forward and backward.  Was able to watch in binoculars.  It had 4 legs under saucer shape.  There was no sound from object but it was firework all around in this area.  But anyway we could here sound from flying planes at that time.  Probably wouldn't pay attention if it want fly so fast - never seen before any object with this speed and lights were interesting.;42.6626;-83.1837
