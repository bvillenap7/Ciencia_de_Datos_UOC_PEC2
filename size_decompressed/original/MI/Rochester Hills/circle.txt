Circle with hole in the middle and pulsating, moving in eastern direction;2002-07-14 22:00:00;30-45 min.;Circle with hole in the middle and pulsating, moving in eastern direction I was taking the trash outside to where it's picked up Monday morning and I saw this really bright light in the sky.  It wasn't overhead or anything but it was the brightest thing next to the moon.  I went inside to get my Dad and Mom to look at it and neither of them could explain it.  My sister came out and she had no idea what it was.  My Dad has this Celestron telescope so we went into the house to get it so that we could look closely at it.  Before we went in it had appeared to be stationary in the sky and not moving.  When we came back out it was still there but it seemed a little closer to the treeline.  Over the next 30-45 min. we watched it and it looked like a circle with a hole in the middle like a compact disk.  The disk kind of looked like a single cell bacteria under a microscope with a bunch of things swimming in it.  There were also two aircraft flying in a Northeasterly direction.  Since we were watching it more closely we noticed that it was moving in an western direction and out of sight because of the trees.;42.6626;-83.1837
