I was standing out on a loading dock on a cigarette break.  It was a cloudless day and I was watching a jet liner climb to altitude when I looked almost straight up and saw a glimmer at around 70 degrees (using me looking straight up as 90, I would say the plane was 20-25 above the horizon).   At first thought I thought it was a drone because the object was not moving and had what looked like a white light coming from the side of it.  The longer I watched it,  I noticed the light grow to almost triple the size it was before.  I looked away for a second to flick my cigarette and I couldn't find the object in the sky again.  The object was stationary during my entire viewing.  The only change was the size of the light.  I couldn't tell how high the object was, or it's size.  After sky gazing for sometime I would assume that the object was at or around cruising altitude for a jet.  I could make out a greyish color to the craft, but no discernible shape, just enough to see that there was something that was emitting or reflecting the light.  I attempted to take a picture with my cell phone, but the object was too far away to show anything other than pixels.  I grabbed my actual camera and tried to find it again but had no luck.;42.6626;-83.1837
