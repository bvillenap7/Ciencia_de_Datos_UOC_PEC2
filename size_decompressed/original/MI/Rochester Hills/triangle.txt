Triangle shaped UFO over Rochester Hills, MI in the summer over '95;1995-05-26 01:00:00;10-15 min;Triangle shaped UFO over Rochester Hills, MI in the summer over '95 I heard Peter Davenport on Coast to Coast AM, went to your sight, and was curious of a sighting I had when I was 10 years old, that I've told few people about.   I did a search in your data base and came to this report, http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/026/S26648.html.   Almost exactly what I saw, and I felt like I had to give you my story. I do not remember what day this happened, but 26 May '95 (as in the report above) seems very plausible. In the summer of  '95 I was awakened (about 1 AM) by the window next to my bed vibrating by a deep note (sounded like some type of engine, but at a very low frequency).  I opened the window to stop the vibration, and looked out south towards Avon Rd. and Livernois Ave. in Rochester Hills, MI and saw a giant triangle UFO.  My house was right next to two 'busy' streets, at least 10 cars a minute during the night, during this I did not see one car the whole time the UFO was in the sky. At each one of the corners, there was a colored ball, greenish, set into the craft.  It looked like a propulsion system, it seemed like something (a liquid) was flowing within the pods. I don't know how big it was, I had nothing to compare it to, somewhere between 250 m  and 1500 km long, and three-quarters again as wide, and the depth was about one-third of the width, like an isosceles triangle, or an arrowhead.  Traveled very slowly E to W. It seemed blocky, like it was back engineered alien technology.  It didn't have the sleekness that is usually attributed to UFOs, though I am not an expert. Within one month of this sighting (I didn't put two and two together for several years) I found a bump on the back of my neck.  Went to the doctor to check it out, he had no idea what it was.  He brought in other colleges to check it out, they were clueless as well.  The told me that it seemed harmless but that I should go see another doctor, which I never did.  It is still there, 13 years later, hasn't cause me any harm that I know of, but it does seem to be shrinking in size (or maybe I just grew). ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate.

I spotted a floating object in the sky with 3 yellow lights in the shape of a trianagle, that disappeared into the clear night sky.;2010-08-06 00:00:00;15 seconds;I spotted a floating object in the sky with 3 yellow lights in the shape of a trianagle, that disappeared into the clear night sky. North of my home, between 22:00 and 23:00 in Rochester Hills, Michigan, while standing on my porch, I saw three yellow lights with a thin and faint beam of light connecting the three to form a triangle shape.  The lights were about the size the size of stars in the sky, they were clearly not stars due to their color and movement.  From where I stood the figure was smaller than the side of the moon, but larger than a commercial airplane in the sky. The figure appeared to be slowly hovering, moving from the east to the west.  I watch it until it seemed to glimmer out of sight, as if it were slipping behind a cloud. I didnâ€™t hear any sounds. The sky, however, was clear that night. After the object disappeared I went back inside. About an hour later I went back outside onto my porch and looking in the direction of where I had last seen the figure in the sky. I saw three thin clouds which clearly appeared to be contrails from a jet of some sort, each coming from where I had seen the small lights earlier.

A triangular shaped, bright - totally lit up with rays of light beaming a short distance from it in all angles,  UFO passed high ubove me toward the northeast.  Silent.  Super bright white.  It quickly moved out of sight at a steady, fast pace.  From the beginning of viewing upon entering and exiting, my backyard trees blocked it from my view.  From my view it was about as big as a 1 1/2k diamond - with beams of light shining out to double its size.   About 2 minutes later a helicopter passed overhead in a southeast path.
