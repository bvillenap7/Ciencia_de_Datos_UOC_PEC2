Two bright lights were suspended in the sky and viewed from Rochester Hills, MI then suddenly disappeared.;2007-06-19 21:55:00;5 minutes;Two bright lights were suspended in the sky and viewed from Rochester Hills, MI then suddenly disappeared. As three other students and I were walking out of our European Literature class at 9:50 PM we saw two extremely bright lights in the sky towards the south.  They were quite low to the horizon, and we thought that they were planets at first.  However, we figured that two planets would not be shining so brightly so close together.  The two lights were just hovering in the air, and then one of them starting moving east very slowly.  As this light moved its light slowly dimmed until it disappeared (about twenty seconds in duration).  However, the other light continued hovering for another minute or two.  This light then moved in the same direction as the first and dimmed even faster.  Both yellow lights that were extremely bright and were suspended in the sky suddenly vanished into the sky.  This is one of the most peculiar and unexplainable things that I have ever seen, and all four of us are certain that these were not helicopters and certainly not airplanes.;42.6626;-83.1837
Bright  star like object right outside my door picks up other objects.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus, we suspect.  PD));2007-10-21 02:00:00;3 hrs;Bright  star like object right outside my door picks up other objects For several nights leading up to the 21st of October I had noticed a group of what appeared to be satellites in various locations scattered about the horizon. They had blue and red pulsating lights. What caught my attention was when one of them moved and started to get closer. I saw these small UFOâ€™s every night leading up to the morning of the 21st. I even had my son come outside and look.  On the morning of the 21st at 2::00 (am) I opened the front door of the house in Rochester Hills and I was stunned. There was an extremely bright star like object directly in line with my front door. It was distant at first but slowly moved closer and closer until I could make out its outline. I am 55 years old and I have never seen anything like it before. It was definitely nothing that I have seen in the sky or earth. The same satellite looking objects were also in the sky at the time holding stationary positions from left to right in the horizon. One was directly above the bright object.  When the bright object moved closer the wind blew the tree tops. I observed the bright object until 5:00 (a.m.). During that period of time it moved closer and then further away. It also moved from being dead center of my doorway to being to the right of the doorway. At 4:30 (am) the small satellites began moving slowly toward the big bright light and appeared to line up behind it. They then disappeared one by one inside of the bright light.

At about 11:00 pm on July 31st I was sitting on my deck looking to the north east sky when I observed an object bigger than a star that seemed to flash lights moving at an erratic rate of speed. It then jumped upwards at an awkward angle, down again and then just seemed to vanish into the sky, this lasted roughly 10 to 20 seconds.;42.6626;-83.1837
