Object burning up in atmosphere traveling east to west at high rate of speed;2000-10-31 18:45:00;11 seconds;Object burning up in atmosphere traveling east to west at high rate of speed Facing North talking with a group of people (2 Adults, 5 children) on Halloween night notice from the northeast sky about 20° above the eastern horizon an object that appeared to be burning up in the atmosphere. The object appeared to be on an elliptical trajectory. The speed of the object was much greater than any known aircraft I have ever seen, but was slower than a meteorite. Continued viewing the object from east to west, as it appeared to be skipping across the atmosphere until it was out of view because of the tree line at about 20° above the northwest horizon. Viewing conditions were clear, no clouds or haze in the sky. My backgrounds is that of an amateur astronomer and have spent many nights viewing the sky.;42.6626;-83.1837
