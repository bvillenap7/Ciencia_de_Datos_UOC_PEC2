In 1988, on a sunny Easter day at 2:00 PM ,I was sitting on my deck enjoying the warm weather.  I heard a Passenger Jet flying overhead.  Not sure of the altitude but it was leaving contrails so I'm guessing over 15,000 ft. or higher.  The Jet was quite visible.  About 1/4 mile behind the Jet was a round silver object about the same size as the Jets fuselage, it was following the Jet. At first I thought the Jet was pulling  balloon but that didn't seem reasonable.  I viewed it for about 30 seconds and all of a sudden the object shot off at a 45 degree angle, to the north west and disappeared over the horizon in less then a second.  It was almost like it knew I was looking at it?  Whished I'd never seen it, hard to deal with something something I can never explain after all these years.;42.6626;-83.1837
3 amber-tan spheres spotted over skies in michigan;2012-02-09 22:00:00;1 minute;3 amber-tan spheres spotted over skies in michigan I was walking home last night around 10pm. i looked to my left and i noticed 3 translucent, spherical, amber-tan colored objects rising in the skyline above my neighbor's house. They were in an up and down row but the 3rd one started to move in front of the other 2 just as i lost sight. I would say they were roughly about 50 feet in the air.   There was 3 of them moving up in the sky independently of each other.  I was able to track their slow, upward movement for about one minute until my view was obstructed. They were traveling upwards way too slow for them to be any kind of objects that were thrown up in the air.  I instantly got goose-bumps all over my body due to the fact that i could not explain what i was seeing.  They were translucent amber-tan colored spheres and the inner part of the sphere was less translucent than the outer edges.;42.6626;-83.1837
