35 small lites fairly straght line all spaced closely  in sky headed west to east from Chicago area. ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-26 22:10:00;2 minutes;35 small lites fairly straght line all spaced closely  in sky headed west to east from Chicago area. My wife an I watch 35 lights very high in sky, in almost a straight line fly over our home in Union MI tonight.  They were flying west to east in slight southern sky as we were in hot tub in our deck.  My wife is very skeptical, but was surprised by what she witnessed.  They were not evenly spaced out, slighty out of line but looked like they were headed to same destination.  No sound or blinking.  I have never seen that many satilites lined up like that.  way to slow for meteor,  speed of slow satilites.;41.7878;-85.8573
