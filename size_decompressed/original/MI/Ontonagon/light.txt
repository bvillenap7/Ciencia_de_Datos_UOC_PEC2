I witnessed a solid white light with pinkish strobe lights on either side of the main white light in the middle.  Together they formed an oval saucer shape.   The blinking lights had no rythem and were blinking sparatically.  It was close enough to me that it light up the entire ground and trees around me.  If not for that I would never have known it was behind me.   I killed the snowmobile and the object made absolutely no noise whatsoever.  It hovered silently slowly moving up and down and they drifted far to the right and slowly went away from me.   I tried chasing it through the woods, until it flew in a different direction that the trail went, so I lost sight of it.  But before I chased it, I called my wife to tell her what I was experiencing, only to be surprised when she started yelling at me, wanting to know where the hell I was, because I thought I left my parents 10 minutes ago, and she said it had been over 2 hours.
