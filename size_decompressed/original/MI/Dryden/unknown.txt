My 8 year old son noticed a light in the sky and notified myself and my husband of said light. We looked up and saw two bright lights in the sky, very bright at first then faded as the light moved upward very high into the sky. As it moved upward the light changed from yellowish, to white to orange, several times and it kept getting smaller and smaller. It's still out there, very faint though, just moving straight upwards.;42.9363;-83.1511
