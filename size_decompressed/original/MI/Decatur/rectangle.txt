It was about 1 AM, an orange light (one witness said it looked like it was rectangular) moved across the sky.   It was heading west while coming from the east.   We lost track of it once it disappeared behind some trees.   It made no sound, and was moving too fast to be a hot air balloon.   It didn't flash or flicker and was moving very steadily across the sky.;42.1049;-86.035
