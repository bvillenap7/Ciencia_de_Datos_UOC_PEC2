Orange orb and 3 flashes in the northern sky/horizon;2008-07-12 03:00:00;3 min;Orange orb and 3 flashes in the northern sky/horizon Well the first thing that i seen was an orange orb kinda floating from west to east across the sky at a slow speed and as i was looking at it...it completely vanished. Not a cloud in the sky. Then i was looking almost straight north..towards the north star...and i seen 3 flashes of light....almost like a small firecracker had blown up from a distance. It was that kind of flash. 2 of the flashes were in the same spot and the third flash was to right of the others.;43.224;-85.5409
