It was strange because the sun was up and the light from the sun was hiding all stars.  The white light dimmed after about 15 seconds to about 50% strength.  15 more seconds later, it disappeared completely.  A meteor would have gradually dimmed.  This was instantaneous change.  As if thrusters went from full to half to zero strength.;43.224;-85.5409
