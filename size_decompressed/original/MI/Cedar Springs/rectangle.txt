square of 16? twinkling multicolored lights that hovered in air;2017-12-30 17:30:00;20 minutes;square of 16? twinkling multicolored lights that hovered in air while looking through my orion space probe 130st telescope I got for Xmas I noticed a twinkling of multi color lights on a heading of 123 degrees from my house at about a 20 degree angle into the sky about halfway from the moon to the horizon.  At first I thought it was a commercial jet but it rarely moved I'm sorry I am not more accurate but I am just learning to use the telescope I focused the target scope of the twinkling lights and then looked through the lens and saw a square of (16?) multi colored lights with light rays emitting from each of the equal sides I called my wife up and she saw the same thing. Today I used google earth to plot the direction and the local Ionia prison is about 45km away on the same degree heading. Maybe I saw prison yard lights but at that distance they were so high in the sky I don't know how that is possible. If you can help direct me to someone that might help me decipher what I saw it would be appreciated.;43.224;-85.5409
