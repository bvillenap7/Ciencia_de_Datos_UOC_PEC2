No sounds, red flashing light on bottom, like knight rider.;1987-08-20 01:00:00;10 min;No sounds, red flashing light on bottom, like knight rider. I was only around 13.  My now ex step dad and I were staying the night at our new home site.  We were out by the fire, laying on those outdoor recliners.  The object we saw made no sound.  It was probably the  size of a high school foot ball stadium, with multicolored lights around the outside.  It just floated over the trees, and was only about 200 feet away from our spot.  The bottom of the craft had a red light flashing back and forth across it, just like on knight rider, only it was huge.
