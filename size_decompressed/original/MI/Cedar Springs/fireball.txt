Not sure on exact date/year but me and my dad were on the way home.  We saw a Green fireball shoot across the sky about 300-400ft off the ground.  It didn't descend it was traveling horizontal with the ground.  It had to be about 10 foot around I'm guessing it was a sphere.  The flame trail was probably 10ft long it shot over a field on our right heading north.  It wasn't going really fast and the green flames suggested something was wrong.  Didn't see anything about it on the news or in the local paper. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.224;-85.5409
