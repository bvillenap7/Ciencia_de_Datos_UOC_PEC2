When I got home I came in to the house and went to tell my sister about it we looked out the window to compare its brightness to a stars and we saw three very bright red lights in a horizontal line it appeared to be just behind the trees behind our house and we shouted to our mom to come see after see got there it stayed it the exact same position for about 15 seconds, this sighting was about 1 min. after the first, also it took a object about 2.75 in. across to cover up all three lights it also appeared to be about 10ยบ above the horizon this time. After this my sister and I ran out behind our house to get a better look at it so we ran out about 100ft. from the back of our house and again about 1 min. later we saw about 5 lights arranged in a circular shape this time it appeared to be about .75 in. at arms length we saw it for about 15 sec. then it vanished. In all these sightings there were no stars visible between the lights and there was no sound at all and there was also no abnormal animal activity. The second sighting it appeared to have traveled north a fair distance across a 5 mph W to E wind, the third sighting it was again further south.;45.2945;-83.8506
