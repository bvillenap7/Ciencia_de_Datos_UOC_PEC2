Lights over Traverse Bay 35min moving than fixed position;2005-10-01 22:00:00;25 min;Lights over Traverse Bay 35min moving than fixed position I saw an object (lights) traveling in a northwest direction over Traverse Bay the speed an trajectory seemed strange (the property is at a high vantage point).  The object stoped and remained fixed for some 35 min.  I retrived the field glasses the lights were at a high altitude and a long distance away ( hard to judge). Holding the field glasses made it difficult to see shape.Steaded the glasses on a log still could not see shape but got a fixed position on object.  Lights were flashing up and down.  Went inside to get ready for bed (10 min) back out to see lights at fixed postion and it was gone.  I'm wondering if anyone in the traverse bay area saw any thing ( this could have been a coast guard helicopter doing manuvers for all I know.  I reported an incident to Peter during the wave of 94 here in Michigan (diff. location and I know that was not a helicopter).;45.0748;-85.2673
