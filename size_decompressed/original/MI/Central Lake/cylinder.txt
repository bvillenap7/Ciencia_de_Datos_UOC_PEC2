Appeared to be tilted at 45 degree angle, hovering high above horizon. As I was driving north on M-88 I saw a shiny object hovering above the trees. I pulled off the road and watched, and as it didn't seem to be moving, I decided to drive to the top of a hill for a better look, but the trees blocked my view. I continued on toward town on a back road, and was able to catch an occasional glimpse of the object. On my way back to M-88 I saw a black truck or SUV parked on the side of the road. The driver was watching the object with a telescope. I wish I had stopped to talk with this man, but I was anxious to get to town to tell my family about it, and to get them to see it also. We drove back out in the country where we had a clear view of the sky, but the object was gone. I don't know who the other witness was, but he must have had a great view with his telescope.;45.0748;-85.2673
