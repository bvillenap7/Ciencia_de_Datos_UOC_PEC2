Well, I'm going to keep this as straight forward as possible. I was on the computer working on a research paper when I heard a strange noise outside, it sounded like an aircraft, but a lot more metallic. It moved fairly low (I estimate about 45 feet above ground) and was much slower than a regular aircraft should move.  I saw it for a brief few seconds and then it flew over some trees (out of might sight).;42.5617747826087;-83.3790086956523
