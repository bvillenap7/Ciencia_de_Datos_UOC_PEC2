Bright white circular object with RED glare glowing behind movng slowly over Orchard Lake, MI.;2008-07-03 22:50:00;10 to 15 minutes;Bright white circular object with RED glare glowing behind movng slowly over Orchard Lake, MI. Bright white circular object with RED glare glowing behind it. Object was moving slowly over Orchard Lake heading north west.  We followed object in car and stopped in neighborhood to get a better view.  As I viewed the object outside my car it had NO sound.  It was basically floating over the area but making distinct turns in its flight path and it seemed to get brighter and dimmer.  Again, this object made no sound...At one point during my observation a plane was heading in another direction at a much higher altitude and I started to hear the sound of the plane as it passed.  After it passed I still saw this glowing object heading north west making no sound.  Altitude was maybe 1000 ft.  After viewing for several minutes, it started to get further away from us and just vanished. Very bizarre!;42.5617747826087;-83.3790086956523
