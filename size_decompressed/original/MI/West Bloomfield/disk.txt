This sighting occurred at 15 mile and Orchard Lake during broad daylight. The object looked like a Ferris Wheel with white lights rotating and no sound. I was a  car passenger traveling Northbound on Orchard Lake.  My girlfriend and I pulled over at the gas station on the corner of 15 mile and Orchard Lake.  We got out of the car where many other people were watching the object.  The object then took off fast toward the northwest and disappeared.  There has to be others that witnessed this sighting. Fyi...I know a tornado hit that area either before or after sighting.;42.5617747826087;-83.3790086956523
Three large orange unknown crafts.;2015-08-27 21:00:00;10 minutes;Three large orange unknown crafts I saw three bright orange disc shaped objects hovering over the North side of the sky, making a triangle shape.  It was way higher then any airplane and did not having flashing lights, only the orange light.   One craft disappeared suddenly straight up.  The other two stayed up and did not circle for two minutes.   Then suddenly, one craft flew towards the last remaining craft and it appeared as if they became joined.   The craft, or crafts suddenly flew upward and completely disappeared within five seconds.;42.5617747826087;-83.3790086956523
