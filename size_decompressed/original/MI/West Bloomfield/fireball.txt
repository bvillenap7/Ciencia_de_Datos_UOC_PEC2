My Mom and I were watching the Lunar Eclipse last Saturday and it was Dark out and the moon was just starting to become eclipsed. We were looking East,North,East at the moon and the object looked as if it was coming from the south going towards the moon. It started out extremily Big and bright almost firery about the size of the moon. It streaked across the sky and about half way across it started to break up disipate as it crossed under the moon and it fadded away. We thought it might be a metorite coming in and breaking up or maybe space junk, but who knows. To me it is a UFO I don't know what it was. I hope this was helpfull. I wouldn't of wrote this but I heard Peter Davenport on Art Bells show and had to put in my 2 cents.;42.5617747826087;-83.3790086956523
