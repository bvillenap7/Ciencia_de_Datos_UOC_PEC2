Flash -Red Beam - Green Beam - Flash;1978-08-15 02:00:00;5 seconds;Flash -Red Beam - Green Beam - Flash I am guessing on the date since it happened so long ago.  It could have been 1978 or 1979 in August sometime. A friend and I were by the edge of Middle Straits Lake at about 2:00 am when a bright light without any sound lit up the entire lake.  It was bright enough that I could see the Golf Course at the other end the mile long lake.   We both instinctively looked up and saw in the high southern sky and saw the following.  A red beam shooting from west to east, a green beam shooting from east to west.   Another brilliant flash from where the red bream was shot.  The flash again lit up the entire area without a sound.
