To whom this may concern: My wife & I saw a fiery orange ball moving north up the Lake Huron shore line 07/04/2014 @ Approximate 2130 Hrs., my guess to how high is about three miles. This incident lasted about five minutes till the distance of object reached itâ€™s vanishing point. This is not my first time seeing strange phenomena in North America. Good luck with the info...

2 bright orbs over Lake Huron, Oscoda, MI.  Dog fight, playing around. anti gravity maneuvers.;2016-07-08 00:00:00;10-12 seconds (3X );2 bright orbs over lake huron, oscoda, mi.  Dog fight, playing around. anti gravity maneuvers. My brother and I went outside and have a smoke, and in Oscoda it gets really dark. We see a jet passing over head like usual...  Then it all happened. two bright orbs chasing each other over Lake Huron.  3 times and 10 to 12 second intervals.  It was like a jet dog fight with no noise and making anti gravity turns at extreme speeds. It stopped on a dime and make a crazy turn.  No jet on earth can manuaver they way we seen these two orbs chasing each other.  They looked very high in the sky, above our atmosphere.  It has changed my life....  We still can't believe what we seen with our eyes....;44.4457913838119;-83.3589530026115
