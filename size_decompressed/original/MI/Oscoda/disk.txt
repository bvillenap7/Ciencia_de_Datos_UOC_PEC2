A friend and I were snowmobiling at night in the national forest when our old Snow King stalled out. While trying to pull start it we observed a star in the sky which would become very bright and then dim again.  After about a minute of watching this odd star it dimmed out and dissappeared.I got the machine started and we rode back towards home through the forest. As we reached the opposite side of the ballbark that we were crossing our machine quit again, no surprise. From the other side of the field which was about 300 yards away the saucer shaped craft came up over the trees and proceeded to cross the field at an angle about 10 feet above the ground. It was silent, about the size of a large truck and had a ring of lights around the bottom. It also had two search lights which were also on the bottom spotting the ground independent of each other in the direction it was headed.  I would say that we were about 40 yards away at the closeest point.  My friend kept repeating that she was  about to faint. I could not beleive I was actually witnessing a flying object.The object proceeded to the opposite tree line and went up and over and it was gone.   Of course when we got back to the house since we were taking turns on the snowmobile everyone just laughed at us, but we knew what we saw.The next day we ran to the library and checked out some books with photos of UFO's. I still have one of them that I did not return.I remember this just like it was yesterday but until now havent thought much about writing anybody about it.;44.4457913838119;-83.3589530026115
