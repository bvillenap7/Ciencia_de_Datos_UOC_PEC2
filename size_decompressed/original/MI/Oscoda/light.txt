Light over Oscoda?;2011-08-29 22:00:00;10 minutes;Light over Oscoda? My wife and myself, along with our two boys watched a bright orange to whitish colored light move from the northwest to the southeast toward Lake Huron.  It did a zig zag pattern, then disappeared behind a small cloud.  A couple of minutes later, it reappeared over the lake, heading due north.  It went out of site again and from the southwest, two fighter jets were then seen flying due west, then turned north over Lake Huron.;44.4457913838119;-83.3589530026115
Bright Orange Light Balls that formed a &quotV&quot before we lost sight of them.;2015-07-05 22:00:00;3 minutes;Bright Orange Light Balls that formed a &quotV&quot before we lost sight of them Sunday night, July 5th, 2015, we were heading north on Highway 23 through Oscoda toward Harrisville.  My son & I pulled over into a parking lot, somewhere between 10 & 10:30 P.M., to watch the last of fireworks we could see going off over Lake Huron.  While watching fireworks, we noticed a bright light/orange ball in the sky, heading toward us & northward, going very steady, not too fast, but parallel along Hwy 23 (it was basically between us in the parking lot, & the road, as it went over/past us).  We had our windows rolled down, & though there were some fireworks noise, we didn't hear any noise from this orange object, though it went over/past us. After the fireworks ended, we got back on Hwy 23 heading north.  In about 5 miles, suddenly the orange glowing ball came from the east (which was Lake Huron side), & crossed the road ahead of us, flying west.  Then, two more came across, closer together.  A fourth one was back some distance, following the other 3.  We didn't see what the first ball did, but the 2nd & 3rd, after crossing the Highway a short distance, & where we could still see them above the trees, started to slow & then hover.  They waited until the 4th orange ball caught up & joined them.  The number 2 orange ball was in front, number 3 on the right, & number 4 took up the left side, so they formed a “V” & then they continued by going northwest. We had pulled over on the shoulder, & had our windows rolled down some.  NO noise was heard, & also, all of these flying orange light balls did a bit of pulsing in brightness, getting a bit brighter & then dimmer as they went along.  There were NO red, green or white lights whatsoever, nor any blinking lights. We would love to know what these things are if top secret military I guess we won't ever be told, but we'd love to have an answer as to what looks like these for night flying & can do this sort of thing.  Couldn't be planes, balloons, or helicopters (would have heard the noise on those).;44.4457913838119;-83.3589530026115
