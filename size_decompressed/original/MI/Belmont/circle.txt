Ball of light approaching a river that slowed and went out.;2016-11-29 23:30:00;45 seconds;Ball of light approaching a river that slowed and went out. My boyfriend and I were driving over the bridge over the Rogue River on Jupiter Rd. heading South.  He was talking as I watched what I thought was a meteorite, just as it got closer, it slowed (which I knew was not normal if it were a meteorite), so I pointed to him and said, Look!  The light surrounding the item went out.   I said, What did you just see?  He responded, A ball of light that went out.  If you didn't point I would have not believed you when you told me about it.   It would have hit the water, but we did not see or hear anything.;43.0762;-85.567
