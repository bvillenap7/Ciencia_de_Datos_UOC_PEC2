Straight band of light(s) moving across the sky of southwest Michigan;2021-05-26 22:55:00;30 seconds;Straight band of light(s) moving across the sky of southwest Michigan Standing in a parking lot in Hartland, MI on May 26, 2021 at approximately 9:55pm. Myself and my partner were looking up at the night sky, stargazing.  Suddenly we both look to the west, about 60 degrees up from the horizon, and there is a long band of light, with what appears to be multiple light sources along the band. This band of light was a straight line. The band moved from direct west to southwest, before dimming and entirely disappearing. It did not move at incredible speed.  At first I thought it may be a plane's landing lights shining on clouds, but there were no blinking or colored lights visible and cloud cover was extremely light, and the dimming and eventual disappearance does not add up to me.;42.654025;-83.71805
