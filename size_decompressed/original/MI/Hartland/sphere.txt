Me and one other individual were traveling eastbound on M-59, passing through Hartland, MI as we spotted approximately 6 orange glowing objects above us, they started at the horizon and were traveling north and upward into the sky. We immediately started recording with my HD FlipCam, once the objects were above us and out of our sight, we turned back around to head West so we could get them back in our sight.  We proceeded to get out of the vehicle and continue the recording of what we were seeing. The groups of 4-8 objects started from the horizon, once they got out of sight above us, another group would appear from the horizon and travel in the same path as the others.  It was a continuous string of lights, as you will see in the video, at times certain objects out of the group would accelerate past the others, proving that these were not lanterns or anything sent into the sky.  If they were balloons they would not be traveling in a perfect formation like these were, they would scatter or simply travel upward and disappear. As I was recording, more cars were pulling over to watch this phenomenon, I approached one of the vehicles to get confirmation of what we were seeing, proving we were not the only ones that noticed the strange lights.  Once we realized there were no more objects coming, we left the scene. The following day, I contacted the Michigan State Police, they had received no reports.  However, the video I caught was once in a lifetime footage.;42.654025;-83.71805
