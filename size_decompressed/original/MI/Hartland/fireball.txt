They came down the same way. I assumed they were hot air balloons but then learned they do not fly at night. The light source was too large to be the blowers used anyway but I am a rational person.I learned that many people in my community also saw them.They seemed to have a slight flicker to their orange glow,they did not make any sound nor was their any other flying objects near them that I could see.I have seen something before similar but green this year but it was only one object and seemed to flash then disappear.The orange lights had purposeful movemen! t,slow and deliberate.;42.654025;-83.71805
