saucer positioned between line of sight and sun.;2003-10-01 16:00:00;2 Minutes;saucer positioned between line of sight and sun. I was blowing leaves off the drive into the woods near my house. One side of the drive has aprox. 30 acres of wooded area, in the back, cornfields, and infront, the road. On my left was a craft, I could not view. it was above the trees, and kept itself positioned between my line and sight and the sun the entire time. It cast a large, but light shadow onto me. Its movements were precise, with every movement I made, it adjusted itself so that I could never view it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.654025;-83.71805
