Unknown Sighting;2013-09-13 23:00:00;5 minutes;Unknown Sighting Walked out onto our back porch a few minutes before 11:00 PM, EST, 09/13/13 with our dog before bedtime.  Noticed (2) glowing objects, red/orange in color in the sky that appeared roughly 15 deg. North of East and moving SW.  Looked at my watch and it was precisely 11:00 PM. While I watched, the object which appeared to be in a more Southerly position paused and did not move again until the trailing object caught up and passed.  After it had passed, both moved on in a South Westerly direction. After (2) minutes or so, both objects simply disappeared.  A few seconds later, another object without so reddish a color appeared moving in the same general direction.  It also disappeared much quicker than the other two. The entire incident was over within (5) minutes. The event occurred in the Grand Rapids, MI vicinity, with the objects appearing North of Gerald R. Ford Airport.;42.8969;-85.56525
Abt 30 objects with one white light evenly spaced, traveling slowly at high altitude in a line.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-04-17 22:00:00;30 minutes;Abt 30 objects with one white light evenly spaced, traveling slowly at high altitude in a line over the course of about 20 minutes Tonight at approximately 10 pm I stepped out on my porch to look at the stars, when I noticed two stars evenly spaced moving across the sky, then another, then another, in what appeared to be slow flying, high altitude crafts, all evenly spaced apart, heading in a straight line toward the north east.  I called my husband after I witnessed about 8 of them, and he joined me on the porch.  We watched at least another 5 or 6, appearing one at a time from the south west, evenly spaced, traveling at the same speed, and disappearing in the north eastern sky.  My husband went back into the house, and I grabbed my phone to call my brother who lives about 5 miles away.  He stepped outside and together, we watched them come again and again.  That phone call lasted about 10 minutes, we saw at least another 6 together.  I needed to know I wasn't alone in seeing these.  Very strange and a bit scary.  They subsided at approximately 10:20 pm.  I have written to Wood Tv 8 and to Gerald R. Ford International Airport to see if I can get an explanation of what these air craft might have been, and am awaiting a response.;42.8969;-85.56525
