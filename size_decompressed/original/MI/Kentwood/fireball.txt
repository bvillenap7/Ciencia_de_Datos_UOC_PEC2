The streak was blue, green and red, orange.;2014-08-23 10:00:00;3 seconds;Kentwood, MI (central Michigan)   Sitting in my garage listening to the Tiger's game, looking toward the South West, I saw a streak going across the sky from South East toward North West.  It's direction was toward the Earth at about 20 degrees.  The streak was blue, green and red, orange.  I waited for a sonic boom, there was none. If it was a firework, I would think it would have made an noise.  If it was a meterorite, it may have been miles or states away. Just wanted to report this in case someone else saw it. Thanks,  Me;42.8969;-85.56525
