Circular Object;1995-06-06 16:00:00;15 sec's;Circular Object I was sitting at a stoplight at the intersection of 36th and Patterson facing West when i saw a gray spherical object high above the horizon.  At first I thought it was a helium balloon or something except it didn't move. As I watched it turned black like it was being eclipsed by something then completely vanished.

The object moved at a slow speed and emitted no audible sound.  After about 25 sec.s the object disappeared.  We noticed no other strange lights the rest of the night.;42.8969;-85.56525
