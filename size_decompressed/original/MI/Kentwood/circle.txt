Silver/gray circular object high on horizon;1995-06-06 16:00:00;15 sec's;silver/gray circular object high on horizon This is an update to a previously filed report.  I was sitting at a stoplight at the intersection of 36th and Patterson facing West when i saw a silver/gray spherical object high above the horizon.  At first I thought it was a helium balloon or something except it didn't move. As I watched it turned black like it was being eclipsed by something then completely vanished. The size in relative terms was about the size of a #2 Pencil Eraser held at arms length.  I described it being eclipsed, but it wasn't because of another object.  It looked like a total eclipse of the sun, but you could only see the shadow.  Maybe it was turning, I'm not sure, it was very small from my vantage point. It was the blackest black I'd ever seen, it looked like the period at the end of a sentence floating in mid air.  To go from a silver/gray object to total black was weird. I thought for sure others must have seen it too.  And when I said it vanished, it did exactly that, vanished,  It didn't accelerate in any particular direction. It was just gone. Reminded me of the Dot you used to see on the old Black and White TV sets when you turned them off, just blinked out. This happened around Four O'clock in the afternoon, I was making my way home from work.  Although the Gerald R. Ford Airport is less than a mile from where I was.  It wasn't any kind of aircraft I'd ever seen before.  The weather that day was Sunshine and Blue Skies, that's why it stood out so much. Air temperature in the mid eighties.;42.8969;-85.56525
Fast Aircrafts Chasing Each Other  ((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??  PD));2007-06-19 22:30:00;1 minute;Fast Aircrafts Chasing Each Other Two aircrafts came over our home almost chasing each other at the fastest speed I have ever seen. They were what appeared to be within inches of each other in the air going south. As soon as they went out of sight then another one came from the south and was heading NE at a fast speed also then dissappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Shuttle w/ ISS??  PD));42.8969;-85.56525
Bright object ascends over Grand Rapids, MI no sound.;2015-10-14 20:02:00;7 minutes;Bright object ascends over Grand Rapids, MI no sound. Bright light to our east, close to gerald R ford airport.  Ascended slowly until it reached a height similar to where a helicopter would fly.  Then stopped momentarily and moved quickly to west.  Then disappeared.  And it made no sound.;42.8969;-85.56525
