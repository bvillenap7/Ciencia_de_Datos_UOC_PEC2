I was driving down Wing St. just after sundown and saw in the distance 2 small flashing red lights with 2 larger white lights above the red lights. The white lights were spaced farther apart than the red lights. As I got closer, I saw that the object was perfectly still. The white light beams shone straight ahead into low clouds. The object appeared to be about 150-200 feet in the air (very LOW). It hovered above a barn in a borderline suburban/rural area. The shell seemed to be made of metal, riveted together (very industrial- looking, Star Wars-like). I did not stop my car but drove to my destination about 3 minutes (1 mile ) from the site. When I got out of my car, the lights were not visible across a field.;42.8969;-85.56525
