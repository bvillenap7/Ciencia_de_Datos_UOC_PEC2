Moved from the South to a little north (maybe 1/4 mile) and then mostly stayed in that position from about 19:00 until I put my daughter to sleep at 21:30 - there were no other lights other than white - no flashing lights - just bright.  When first noticed there we no other lights in the sky and too early for stars - it seemed to be in my guesstimate to be about about 3000 to 4000 ft high - hard to judge the size - but it was smaller - possible the size of a small personal plane or smaller.;42.8969;-85.56525
