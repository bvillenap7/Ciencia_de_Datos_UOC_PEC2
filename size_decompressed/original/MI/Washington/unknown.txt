I experience aircraft and helicopters flying over my neighborhood daily.  These aircraft include personal Robinson type helicopters, USCG helicopters, C-130s, private jets, turbine powered propellor driven aircraft, A-10s Thunderbolts and single engine Cessna type aircraft.  The  corporate aircraft fly from east to west multiple time daily en route to Oakland County International Airport.  This airport is approximately 30 miles from my house.  The corporate aircraft are on their final approach to the airport, flying over my neighborhood. We had just pulled into our driveway and were getting out of our car when we saw what appeared to be a soft orange glowing object.  I could not make out any type of shape to the object.  Also, there were no strobe type blinking lights associated with this object.  The Object I and my mom witness was moving at the speed of a single engine aircraft from south to north at about 4,000 to 5,000 ft altitude.  The object did not make any sound.  I had my Iphone5 handy and snapped about 6 pictures of the object.
