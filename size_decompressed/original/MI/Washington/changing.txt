Observed for two hours a bright white light, with two chevrons of bright white light on one side move erratically in the sky.;2003-12-01 05:50:00;2 hours, 5 mins;Observed for two hours a bright white light, with two chevrons of bright white light on one side move erratically in the sky. In a clear southern sky at 5:50 am while getting the newspaper, I looked up and noticed a bright white light (like a distant star) moving evenly to the south. My first impression was that of a satellite. Suddenly the object moved in the opposite direction, toward me, and became much closer and brighter. It's movement hesitated, almost stopping, and hovered. It appeared at times to be a bright round ball of white light with two chevrons of light of equal length on one side of the round ball of light. The side chevrons appeared on one side (180 degrees of the sphere) only. For two hours I watched in amazement as the object moved erratically, in seemingly random but tight patterns. After the first half hour of my observation I awakened my wife and she also observed the object. Gradually with random, back and forth, circular movement and up and down motion, it moved in a northwest direction further and further away - but very slowly. After 1 1/2 hours I asked my wife to awaken my daughter. My daughter also observed what we saw. At times of movement the object appeared to leave a faint trailing edge of light. The tips of the chevron at times appeared to twinkle. After two hours and five minutes of observation, now daylight, the light moving farther and farther away (higher in the sky) I lost sight - just as cloud cover moved in.;42.7327000000001;-83.02949
Shape-shifting craft viewed over Washington, Michigan;2011-07-04 23:00:00;5 minutes;shape-shifting craft viewed over Washington, Michigan The objects seen constantly shifted shape and looked like it was made of plasma.  It looked as if it were wheels of plasma within wheels.   The two silent craft flew slowly forward then took off in the north direction and disapeared behind the tree line.   The 2 craft seemed to have a mind of there own.  One craft was red and one was orange.  One of the observers was a lawyer, one had no job and two were only children.;42.7327000000001;-83.02949
