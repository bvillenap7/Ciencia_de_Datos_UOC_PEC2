Lighted translucent objects meandering about woods & pasture.;2013-08-29 01:00:00;~2 hours;Lighted translucent objects meandering about woods & pasture. I saw a light in my pasture approx. 1 am.  I suspected someone was tampering with thing, so I went out to confront them.  I then realised it wasn't local hoodlums. I saw what I first took to be a lantern kite but it quickly became apparent it was NOT candle kites!  There was a lighted object seeming to float across the pasture when I witnessed another appear from the woods to the east.  This one was larger.  They both changed colors independantly & colors varied to every end of the spectrum!   There are trees, fence, powerlines etc in the area & I could see these obstructions when the objects passed beyond them.  They travelled at different speeds and at times appeared to interact with each other. The manner in which they moved showwed they were not random and they even followed the trails without striking trees, fences etc.  At times up to perhaps a dozen were visable. Sizes ranged from id reckon a basketball to the size of a car!  No detectable sound was heard.  At times one or two would travel off making astonishing high speed turns then dissapear & at times others would appear from an easterly direction. I took MANY pictures with my phone & shot plenty of video. Of paricular interest is the fact that I've shot a lot of video with my phone & never had any audio issues.  In the videos I shot during this event the audio is essentially static.  I've not had this problem before or after. I can offer no explanation & did not report this until I had time to try to determine what I may have seen.  I'd be very happy to find a simple explanation.;43.342;-86.1626
