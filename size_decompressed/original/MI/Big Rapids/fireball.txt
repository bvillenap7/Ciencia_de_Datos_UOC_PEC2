A green fireball appeared suddenly and lit the ground all around the neighborhood, scaring my son and our dogs, then disappeared.;1998-11-01 01:30:00;1 minute;A green fireball appeared suddenly and lit the ground all around the neighborhood, scaring my son and our dogs, then disappeared. My 20-year-old son was walking the dogs at 1:30 AM before retiring when the ground in our residential neighborhood took on an eerie green glow.  The dogs stopped and began to fuss.  He looked up and saw a low-flying, moving fireball with a long tail.  He held his arms out in front of him and said the tail, at arm's length, was about 9-10 inches long behind it.  He said it was silent and so odd that he came immediately home.  He won't say anything more about it other than the dogs were frightened.;43.6926999999997;-85.4781000000002
