Lines coming down to earth from a egg shape light, spacecraft faintly seen in all 3 pictures.;2009-07-10 00:18:00;pictures;Lines coming down to earth from a egg shape light, spacecraft faintly seen in all 3 pictures. Please donâ€™t think this is a hoax and ignore it.  I have pictures of the event.   My granddaughter takes a lot of pictures.  While looking through her recent pictures I discovered these pictures of activity in the sky.  She told me it was the moon when I questioned her about them.  There are three pictures, one with a craft in the background, one with colored lines running down to earth with one looking like a rope, another with colored lines.  Each one of the pictures you can see the moon in the bottom of the picture.  The lines are coming from a ball of light that looks a little like an egg.  The craft can be seen in all three pictures. I am just not sure what I am seeing. I am forwarding all of these pictures.;42.9468;-83.817
