Two triangular craft, red light on front, 2 square white lights on rear, northward at slow speed.;2005-11-10 18:30:00;10 minutes;Two triangular craft, red light on front, 2 square white lights on rear, northward at slow speed. I was travelling eastward on M-56 just east of M-13.  I observed a pair of red lights estimated 30-50 feet apart travelling from my right, about 200-300 feet high.  They were not moving quickly, I would say the were moving slower than a light aircraft would.  As I continued east, I could see that the left-most object also had a white light.  I first thought it was a plane towing something with a red light on it.  As I approached my house, I was nearly underneath the two objects and they crossed M-56. They were both triangular in shape, they did not have standard aeronautical signalling lights.  No flashing lights at all, only a steady red light at the front end.   From behind, both had two square lights on rear of the craft.  I could hear no sound, the road is busy at that time of day.  But definitely no standard aircraft engine noise.  I watched as both stayed in formation, the rear object a little lower than the front object, and they slowly continued North towards Flushing.  I lost sight of them after about 5 minutes.;42.9468;-83.817
Triangular craft with lights in Swartz Creek;2016-06-27 23:00:00;2-5 minutes;Triangular craft with lights in Swartz Creek The other witness and I were driving down the expressway, when I looked up and saw the object. At first glance, it looked like an airplane.  So I asked the witness, That's not a plane is it?  And they proceeded to say that it was just a low flying plane. As we got a little closer, we noticed that the craft was not moving at all, so there was no way that it could be a plane at all.  It was a triangular formation of lights, with three white lights in a triangle in the front, and several white lights and one flashing red on the bottom of it.  The red was in the center. As we continued past, the other witness turned their head to watch it.  The entire craft faded and disappeared. It did not move, it just dissipated into nothing. We didn't see it again.;42.9468;-83.817
