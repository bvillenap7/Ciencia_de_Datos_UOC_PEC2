((anonymous report));2017-09-25 19:30:00;5 seconds;Single UFO, Macomb, Michigan, 7:30pm before dark hovering then took off east.  Very soft buzzing then no sound. Just finished mowing lawn and was about 7:30pm EST, not quite dark but dusk.  Was looking at drones as it was clear out and could see some stars starting to appear.  Was talking with buddy, checking out for drones as it was near Armada Center Rd and North Ave in Armada.  Turned to south and freaked out.  Saw symmetrical disc-shaped object, grey/charcoal surface not sure.  About 1-3 miles away, couldn't tell.  Low altitude just hovering.  Then bright light appeared from rear of vehicle and it took off in a straight path eastward.  Whole event lasted about 5 seconds then gone.  Amazing, will never forget it.
