Three lights slowly and silently passed over my house;2011-07-12 00:08:00;5 minutes;three lights slowly and silently passed over my house out on my upper deck outside of my house, we saw 3 lights aligned in the shape of a perfect triangle. it flew low enough that we could see there was a circular base to the craft. it moved very slowly for about a mile, then picked up speed drastically, and soon was gone in the stars. the 5 minutes it passed over my house into the woods,  we never once heard a sound. we've seen it three times now over the course of a month.  it doesnt seem threatning, but i think they're watching someone, but who?;42.9351;-85.2046
