Same swaying light;2006-01-03 04:08:00;?;Same swaying light Seems like same as last one reported. Only that one appeared to of stopped at around 03:48 when car went by. About 20 minutes later appeared across the street right in front of house. (About 100 yards through the trees in less than a few minutes) Looked to have Two Bright amber ligts with one small faded red light, and looked like hovering at a down right angle. I tried again for a picture, but got nothing. the lights were bright enough to be seen in reflection of door on other side of room. Object appears at time to be heading north towards Grand Haven.
