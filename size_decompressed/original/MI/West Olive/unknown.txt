Sorta swaying light;2006-01-03 03:21:00;?;Sorta swaying light *This event is still happening while I'm typing.  I tried to get a picture, but it wouldn't quite show up, other than a green dot. Rather I zoomed in or out. Looks like glowing amber lights, with what appeared to be a small red light swaying left to right through the trees almost towards the top. (Like it's looking for a landing place) Been seeing simalar light passed week, but in different spot. It's about 200 - 300 yards away. (Across the street) At a couple of time I believed to have seen two amber lights. I tried taking a piture, but couldn't get an image. All other lights in the area shown but that one. And it was the brightest. Seen it before, but it stopped or (Lights out and on) every 10 minutes.  I have seen what looked like a black triangle type craft on Mothers Day of '05 but thought nothing more of it until now.
