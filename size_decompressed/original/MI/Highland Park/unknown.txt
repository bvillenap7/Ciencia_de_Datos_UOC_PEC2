Driving west bound on Davison Freeway nearing the Southbound Lodge exchange.  I observed in the sky a streak of fire heading towards the ground for about 4 seconds.  The color was a bright orange.  Then it just disappeaared.  I listened to hear it something had fell on the news, I heard nothing reported.  I'm not sure if this unidentified flying object was a craft, it was dark still.  All I could see was a streak that looked like fire.  What produced it?  I don't know.  I am a Married mother of six. Had been homeschooling my youngest two sons until 1 year ago.
