Through my windshield I noticed a bright orange/yellow light that at first glance I thought it was a star. Then I recognized that it was too big (about 3 times the size of (Venus or Jupiter) and too bright to be a star and that now looking through the drivers side window, it was moving west to east from the first position I saw it.  After viewing the motion it appeared to be about 1000-2000 ft above treetop level and approximately due south 1/4 mile from my position. I then thought that it was the landing lights of a small airplane.  It was very dark at the time and there is a small airport about 7 miles to the east of my home.  As I turned right onto another road headed north I looked back through the right side of the car about (about 10 seconds from when I first saw it), and even though it had gone approximately 1 mile or so headed due east, the light had not gotten an dimmer. I then realized these were not landing lights, it did not change color or intensity, and otherwise the lights would have dimmed as they passed in the direction it was going. As best I could tell, I saw no red or green lights required for an aircraft, and that it was neither a small plane nor a helicopter. After reading the Characteristic of Object section below, non really fit. It was a steady glowing yellow/orange color that was very bright.;43.7242;-84.3907

We had just finished feeding the horses and were enjoying the beautiful clear sky when we noticed a large rectangular/oblong UFO with double green lights down the sides and single lights at front and rear.  It traveled silently from S/E to N/W at a very high speed, stopped suddenly, changed lights to red and moved on. One of our party was very frightened, so we were forced to leave before it went out of sight.  We couldn't find it when we got back to the house.  None of us have ever seen anything like this before and can't emagine what it could have been -- we told the two children with us that it was Santa's sleigh.  (They didn't see the UFO, just we four adults.)  Please tell me if anyone in this area sighted anything on that night?;43.7242;-84.3907
