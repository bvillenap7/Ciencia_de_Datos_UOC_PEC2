I was walking my dog and while walking I looked into the sky, I thought it was a star at first.  However, the big bright light moved slowly away from the big dipper which seem to suggest it was a airplane but the moving bright light was to bright and to high in the sky that it was impossible to be a airplane I watch for almost 1 min then the light began to move very fast, turned red and disappeared in the sky.
