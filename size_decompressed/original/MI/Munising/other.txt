This UFO was flying from SE to NW going over Lake Superior and was approximately 200-300 feet over the tree lines.  It was flying at supersonic speed with no noise.  It had lots of lights (none were blinking).  It appeared to be square shape. Several weeks also observed going from west to east following Lake Superior, it was square shape, lots of lights only going a little slower (no noise). Living near Lake Superior in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, I have witnessed many UFO sightings. Last year I again experienced another unusual UFO sighting, again going from west to east following Lake Superior, a red ball shaped object going slow and no noise.;46.3994;-86.6983
