Orange orb viewed moving East South East in a floating pattern before disappearing.;2009-07-21 22:25:00;2 minutes;Orange orb viewed moving East South East in a floating pattern before disappearing. A small reddish orange (almost fiery) orb was noticed in the East South East sky at 10:25 p.m. on July 21, 2009..  The orb was mostly overhead when first noticed but continued in the direction it was first seen (East South East).   It continued moving in a floating side to side pattern as it seemed to slowly lose its vibrant light and disappear after heading in the direction for about two minutes.  It was small in the sky but still dwarfed many of the stars and could be 10-20 combined in the sky.  It gave off a good amount of light until the end when it slowly faded out.  The sky was a clear night with little clouds, and none in the area of the UFO.   Almost immediately after witnessing the object we also saw a normal plane in the sky, and in comparison the two are very different.   We only observed one of the orbs. The witness is 54 and a male and was also witnessed by his 18 year old daughter and he called out his 20 year old son.  He is a life long citizen of Munising, Michigan and has seen a few unreported UFO sightings in his life, but has never seen any quite like this.  Also in our area we have multiple (anywhere from 5-25) of another type of light in the sky.  They have moved across the whole sky in instances and always blink red, white, and green.  They don’t appear to be satellites and are sometimes even in a kite formation.  On various nights they are completely unmoving or not even there, and other times they will slide around.  Once the first one was sighted we have seen many since and are there almost every night.  We aren’t saying these are UFOs but that we can’t explain them, and with the UFO sighted last night we feel they should be mentioned as there could (if the lights we see every night are something UFO related) be a connection.;46.3994;-86.6983
