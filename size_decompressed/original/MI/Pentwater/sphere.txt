Amber- red flashing sphere in Pentwater, Michigan.;2012-08-18 22:45:00;5-10 minutess;Amber- red flashing sphere in pentwater michigan We were up in the highest window of our cottage, which is on-top of a tall hill that overlooks Lake Michigan.   While observing late night boaters making their way into the pier south of  our location we noticed flashing lights up in the sky and figured it was just an aircraft, but found it strange that is only flashed amber and red and moved very slowly.   With binoculars my husband looked at the craft and determined that it was not a typical aircraft since the lighting was not standard for civilian or commercial aircraft.  He works with planes for 9 years as a job, and has decent knowledge on them. 5-10 minutes after we saw it it made its way east slowly then vanished within seconds.    We saw 5 aircraft with appropriate lighting, heading from the north, at high altitude shortly after the odd craft dispersed.
