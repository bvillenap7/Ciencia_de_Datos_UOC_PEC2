Two instances of floating orange orbs over Lake Michigan.;2011-08-14 22:30:00;2 min.;Two instances of floating orange orbs over Lake Michigan. It was a clear night and our group of 8 people was watching the night sky while sitting on the beach.  At about 22:30 one of the members of the group noticed two very bright red-orange glowing silent orbs floating in the south sky slightly over the water.  At first, they appeared to be miles down the beach but then they started to slowly move towards us at a constant speed, keeping their formation but moving in slightly different directions.  They appeared as if they might have passed directly in front of us, but then stopped and disappeared into the night sky, still a few miles down the beach. Our group stayed out for a while after, continuing to watch the sky.  Around 23:45 another member of our group noticed a large white orb in the sky above us that quickly flashed away with a very bright light.  Immediately following this, we saw another orange orb that seamed to appear out of thin air.  This time, it was only one, but it moved in the same pattern as the first group of orbs and then disappeared in the same manor.  While all these events were occurring, the family dog noticed the orb and proceeded to growl until it was gone.;43.8277;-86.3864
