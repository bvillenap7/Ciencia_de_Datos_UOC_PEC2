Lighted square and large aircraft.;2014-01-12 19:00:00;60 seconds;Lighted square and large aircraft On this date my wife was on our front porch and noticed a lighted square in the northeast sky. She said she didn't actually see a craft/machine, just the lights in a square/rectangle formation. Her description of the object was a box with about 20 lights-red/green/yellow/white all flashing intermittently.  The object did not fly but shuffled forward/back/up/down while moving in a northeast direction (towards Selfridge ANG base?).  Shortly after seeing the object she said a red non-flashing light dropped out of the center of the lighted square and maneuvered around until it disappeared near the ground. Just after that happened she said a very large low flying jet flying northwest to south with a giant tear dropped shaped very bright belly light appeared on the scene. She emphasized the size of the jet and said the belly light extended to beyond the wing leading edge to past the trailing edge.  If it was a 747 size aircraft that would mean a light of over 30 feet in length.  As soon as the aircraft appeared, the lighted square disappeared/went dark-don't know.;42.5353;-83.1493
