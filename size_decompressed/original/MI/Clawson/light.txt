Intense star like light traveling west to east at night;2012-08-11 22:45:00;5-7 seconds;Intense star like light traveling west to east at night Last night at about 1045 pm I was outside to test my new binoculars when I saw a light in the night sky that was most unusual.  My background is 16 years in the USAF aircraft crew chief-flight chief in aircraft maintenance and I come from a family of bonified aviation &quotNUTS&quot.  So I am familiar with most anything man has thrown into the atmosphere or space.  This light was 1 mile away, 500' up and traveling at about 200mph very constant speed (emphasis on very), traveling west to east, no noise. It was the characteristics of the light itself that really caught my attention.  It was like a very pure white small star had silently flown by. And the light itself was very bright pure white intense but easy to look at but no rays of light comming from it like you would have from a landing light.  Additionally there were no anti-collision, strobe, formation or position lights and no sign of a vehicle.  I am sure it was probly just an aircraft with a light ! am not familiar with...;42.5353;-83.1493
