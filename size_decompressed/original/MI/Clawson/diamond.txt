4 bright diamonds and aircraft.;2013-10-01 06:15:00;5 minutes;4 bright diamonds and aircraft On this date my wife saw 4 very brightly lighted diamond shaped objects in the early morning sky.  She is guessing at the shape, they were so blindingly bright as to obscure the shape.  The objects were south of our house, 2 were to her left near the horizon.She observed a 737 sized aircraft flying west to east just above our garage but further away, maybe a mile.  The other 2 diamonds were in the area of this aircraft.  My wife then said one of the diamonds started to follow the aircraft moving in an up and down flight pattern as it followed this aircraft.  Sunrise was at 7:30am that day.;42.5353;-83.1493
