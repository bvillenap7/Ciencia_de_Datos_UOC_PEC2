PD));2007-06-19 22:35:00;10 minutes;Observed two lights in a line one forward and one in rear traveling south east towards detroit. Observed two lights one forward and one in rear traveling south east towards detroit. Saw several planes in the air at the same time. two commercial and one private. I went outside to have a cigarette and noticed these two lights moving in the sky going towards the south east. I watched the two lights pass several stars and these were definitely not a solid object since I was able to see the stars between the lights as they passed over head. The speed of these two lights was relative to a normal private craft in flight. I listened for sounds and heard nothing. I concentrated for other lights blinking, red or green and saw none. no strobe, no trail, nothing. I heard no noise. While outside I was on the phone having a conversation with a friend. As I watched the lights moving I explained to my friend to go on her porch to see if she could see the lights which were moving towards her direction I ran in the house to grab my camera and took two under exposed pictures and then lights went out.
