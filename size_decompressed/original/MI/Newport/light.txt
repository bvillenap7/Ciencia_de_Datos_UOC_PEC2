Bright white flashing.;2017-04-29 23:00:00;3 minutes;Bright white flashing We were driving back to Detroit from Ohio, and along 75 north, a bright white light appeared in the West skies..  It got slightly bigger as it seemed to get closer to the ground. It lit up the cloud and tunrded it bright white, where it then looked like a disk.   After it did that it seemed to have literally just dissapeared.  A few seconds of still watching the sky in shock, it appeared again and it got closer, had pushed thru the clouds, and appeared to have blinking lights of some kind.  Literally it shot off after about 3 minutes of it moving thru the sky;41.981;-83.269
