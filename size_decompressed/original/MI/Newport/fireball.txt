6 Orange Fireballs;2012-09-11 21:32:00;45 minutes;6 Orange Fireballs On 9-11-2012 at approximately 9:32 PM, I had just gotten home from a friend’s house about 3 blocks from my home in Estral Beach, Newport, Michigan.  I was getting out of my vehicle when I noticed a HUGE orange glowing ball coming from Lake Erie.  I hurried up and ran in the house to get my husband.  We both ran outside and were in awe at what we witnessed.  There were a total of 6 HUGE orange glowing balls that looked as if the end was on fire.  They came in pairs but they were not very close to each other.  There was no sound and they looked to be as big as a vehicle.  They were much lower than any aircraft I have seen.  We called several other people in our community to go outside and witness this.  Several witnesses said that there were small “search” planes in the area and over Lake Erie very shortly afterwards.  We live only a few miles from Fermi Nuclear Plant.  This is the first time we have ever seen anything like this before.;41.981;-83.269
