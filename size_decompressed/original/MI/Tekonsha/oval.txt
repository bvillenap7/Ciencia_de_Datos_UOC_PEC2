We were sitting outside looking at birds & clouds, when I noticed a dark shape, which I took to be a bird soaring way too high. Within a second I realized it wasn't a bird but it was steadily moving very fast at a high rate of speed towards the east.  It bounced around a couple times in this trajectory.  By the time my husband saw it as I was trying to point it out, it had reached a bank of luminous clouds where it disappeared but it kept briefly reappearing in different spots all over a large area of these clouds.  Sometimes it was very vague & other times more visible. The color was just a dark gray/black but it seemed far away & moved quickly.  We do have a lot of planes over this area, so I know what that looks like & how high they fly generally. I also had a sighting a few miles from here in 1983-ish. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.0876;-84.997
