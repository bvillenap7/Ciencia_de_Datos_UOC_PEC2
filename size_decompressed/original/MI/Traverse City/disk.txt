I was looking for a ufo that night and I looked into the northwest sky and I saw a silver metallic saucer shaped disc flying very high in the sky. It had no sound and it glowed like it was having a light reflecting upon it or glowing from within. It stayed in place for about 20 secs. and then took off very fast to the right about 500 ft. and then took off to the left the same distance and then went down about the same distance and the after about 2 mins. took off very, very fast out of sight.

Typical saucer shaped craft hovering close to road apx 45 feet above road;2003-09-25 20:00:00;Apx 15 minutes;Typical saucer shaped craft hovering close to road apx 45 feet above road I am reporting this as told to me by my son.  We live apx 4 miles from Grand Traverse Bay on the East of us and Lake Leelanau 1/4 mile to the West of us in what is known as a little town called Bingham.  My son was on his way to the Marathon station for gas and there is this road that winds its way through a little valley and there is a cherry orchard on one side.  The craft was noted apx 45 feet in the air hovering in the valley next to the cherry orchard.  It then moved closer to the road to the point where my son could see the typical round object on the underneath and the three lights, blue, red and white.  He said it hovered there, made no sound and had a wobbling motion.  A car was coming from the other direction and the craft was so low the car did a U-turn and went in the other direction.  My son was physically shaking from the encounter and expressed to me the intense desire to get distance between him and it due to its proximity to the road.  He said it then moved south and he followed it South on Co Rd. 633 towards Crain Hill road and it then descended below a tree line to the point he could not see it anymore, leaving him questioning whether it landed or not.  This is his second sighting of UFO craft in that 1-mile radius in 2 months.  The earlier one was in June or July, can't remember which, and was a somewhat different shaped craft and was not as low to the ground.  He was on his way again to get gas at the Marathon station. My son is a college student, 2nd year culinary.  Very level headed individual.;44.7115851185938;-85.6666843534786
