Three orange &quotfire balls&quot move slowly and then fade out.;2013-07-06 23:00:00;two minutes;Three orange &quotfire balls&quot move slowly and then fade out. Around 11 pm on Saturday night, my husband and I observed 3 orange balls of light in the night sky.  It was a clear night with many stars out, but these were bright orange, not stars.   At first, we thought they were planes, but they were too close together and all traveling at the same speed going in the same direction.  The middle one then blinked a bit and disappeared.    The other two followed suit.   They did not return, and no shadows were seen after the lights went out.  No other orange lights were observed that night, we stayed out for another two hours.   We have many planes that fly around us in our area, but these were not planes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
