Soft lights, darting in a very fast pattern.;2016-07-07 23:30:00;5 minutes;Soft lights, darting in a very fast pattern. looking up at the stars with my friend in Traverse City, Michigan, a group of about 6 soft lights were darting around the sky, it seemed to have lasted for quite a few minutes.  Then there were 2 left and they were definately following each other in a very fast pattern, in and out of a long cloud.  Then they two disappeared.  Some time of energy that we can not explain.

String of *stars* evenly spaced, traveling strait line.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-06 20:30:00;15-25 minutes;String of *stars* evenly spaced, traveling strait line. This event occured approxamately 30-40 minutes ago. Friday, March 6 2020. Sighting started approxamately 8:30 PM EST and lasted until approx 8:45 PM EST. Observed from Traverse City, MI. Weather: Clear skies. stars appear sharp/bright. Moon approx 75% full. Venus visible almost due west. Temp 28 deg according to WeatherUnderground. Obeservation: I stepped outside my back door approx. 8:30 to smoke a cigarete. I looked up to see if the night sky was clear/crisp as we are expecting cold temperatures tonight (forcasted 10 deg F.) I looked up and noticed the moon then looked to my right a little (facing south) and could see Orion behind the limbs of the oak tree at the edge of my property. Then I looked to Venus, turning to face due West. While lookin to Venus, I noticed a *star* moving slightly up and right. Near Hamal (mag 2.00). The *star* was about the same brightness as Hamal. I observed it moving in an up and right direction . I first thought it must be a satalite as it was moving in a perfect strait line. The *star* did not blink- it stayed a solid, steady brightness until I lost sight of it. I measured 15 fingers (like how you measure amount of daylight left with your fingers stacked. I made this measurement at approximately the 8th/ninth object.) that I observed them. After I lost sight of the first, I noticed another from the same origin (Near Hamal) traveling in the same direction, same perfect strait line, and disappear in same spot. I looked back again to Hamal, and another. They were all evenly spaced, traveled same speed. There were 12 in all that I saw. All appeared the same. All traveled the same speed. same direction. Observed the originate from same spot and disappear in same spot, with one exception. the ninth was a double. It was two objects, slightly brighter than the previous objects, same speed, same direction same spots. They were close together (less than the width of my pinky finger at arms length) and remaned same distance appart entire time observed. I observed three more objects- they looked just like the others besides number 9. I tried to range them with a Leupold IR Laser range finder (Model RX-1300i TBR). It could not range them- It has 1300m range on reflective targets, and ~900m range on non-reflective animal sized targets. I could not discern any shape other than they appeard as sharp (focused) stars. I could not estimate the distance as I could not estimate their size due to unk distance. I continued to remain outside observing the same area and ocassionally looking further to might upper right to see if they reappear. nothing further observed. I Never heard a sound from them. I do live very close to an airport (TVC) less than a mile south of me. THESE WERE NOT NORMAL AIRCRAFT. I've observed satelites countless times. I've seen a numerous meteor showers, and observed several fire-balls in sky from meteorites entering atmosphere- most noted in news and seen with other whitnesses. I am familar with the night sky- I look up a lot at night as I have a life-long fondness of the night sky. I am 100% certain this was not a meteor or meteor trail, mostly due to the double that I observed, but also that they were so evenly spaced that it appeared precise. distance traveled, speed, and all appeared from same spot and all disappeared in another spot.;44.7115851185938;-85.6666843534786
