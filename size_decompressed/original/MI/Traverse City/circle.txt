Five nearly circular fire colored objects drifting across the sky;2006-09-02 23:00:00;15 Minutes;Five nearly circular fire colored objects drifting across the sky While on a camping trip at Traverse City State Park in Northern Michigan, 6 people in our group noticed a circular orange-yellow object moving east to west at a relatively slow pace across the night sky.  The object seemed to have a tail, like a comet, and had the appearance of being on fire.   Two more objects followed, travelling the same path in succession.  The fourth object followed the same path as the first three, and was closesly followed by the fifth object, which appeared to be closer and/or larger, and travelled east to west on a slightly more southerly path.   The fifth object was shaped more like a lemon and a small light was visible tracing the perimeter, clockwise, then counter-clockwise, and repeating.   Several of us reported the sighting to three Conservation Officers at the State Park, who had also seen the objects, and stated that we were among 40 or more people who had reported the event.   The Officers contacted the United States Coast Guard to inquire about the objects, and they were told that no USCG personnel had witnessed the event.   On our way back to the campsite, one of the Conservation Officers remarked, Sweet dreams.;44.7115851185938;-85.6666843534786

It was bright orange and twinkled like firelight.  I could not detect an accompanying noise.   I watched it until it was too far away to detect.  This was followed by three more occurrences of the orange light, each of the successive lights followed the same trajectory, and traveled at the same pace across the sky.   I watched all until I could not detect them anymore.  This event lasted until 10:00 pm. ((NUFORC Note:  The date provided by the witness appears to be flawed.  We attempt to telephone the witness, but her telephone does not allow incoming calls!!  We have assigned an arbitrary date, which is our best guess.  PD));44.7115851185938;-85.6666843534786
