Three eye-witnesses to a bluish light that moved so fast it was unreal above the tree tops.;1990-11-01 19:00:00;2-3 min;Three eye-witnesses to a bluish light that moved so fast it was unreal above the tree tops. In November of approx. 1990 or 1989 I witnessed with two of my children a bright light approaching our cabin.  The light was a bluish spotlight that appeared funnel shaped and it was shining down just above the tree tops as it came toward us.  The leaves were all off the trees and we were just about to get into our car.  It dawned on me that there was no noise at all like a month earlier when Coast Guard heliocopters were searching for a lost kayaker on the lake beside us.  Suddenly, the large light went straight up to a pinpoint in a matter of seconds and zig zagged across the sky.   I called the local air control tower and he said no flights were in the area and he gave me the closest AFB in Oscoda and I spoke with their air controller who also said no military planes were in that area at the time.  He gave me an 800 number to call and report a UFO which I did, however, no one ever contacted me about it.  A few months later on the front page of the Record Eagle newspaper was an article about another sighting in Kingsley,MI. about 12 miles from our home.  This time a State Police trooper saw one as big as a huge football field over a lady's barn.  He took some pictures of it (which were never released to the paper) and he and the lady watched it for about an hour.  It was never explained what it was that he saw.  I work as a nurse administrator and I did not report the event I saw with my kids because of the way people react.   I am 57 years old and my son was about 9 years old..  He is now 32 and he still recalls what happened too.  We feel we saw a real UFO.  My ex-mom in law the next day described what I had seen too and she lived about an 1/8th of a mile away.  She said she had never seen anything like it either. ((NUFORC Note:  The source of the report indicates that the date is approximate.  We suspect that the date of the incident may be in 1994, given that the trooper managed to video a UFO in late December of that year.  PD));44.7115851185938;-85.6666843534786
Light spotted over Traverse City Mi. traveling at a high rate of speed 11:40 July 31 ,2001;2001-07-31 23:40:00;2 minutes;Light spotted over Traverse City Mi. traveling at a high rate of speed 11:40 July 31 ,2001 It was about 11:40 Pm. and I was laying in bed looking at the stars through the window.I noticed a bright orange/red light that I know was higher then commercial jets.fly. I would guess that if a commercial jet flies 36 to 45 thousand feet this was flying about 3 times that height. It was hard to try and determine the speed but I can say that it went from the southwest to the northeast until I could not see it any longer in about 2 minutes. I have seen satelites at night before and this was no satilite. It went in a straight line...I started thinking while I was watching this thing that when looking at airliners flying at night they almost look like they are not moving. But this object was moving and moving fast. Funny color too. Orange and red.;44.7115851185938;-85.6666843534786
About 50 lights, similar to what satellites look like, travelled across the sky North to South  in one large group.;2012-07-07 23:15:00;3 minutes;About 50 lights, similar to what satellites look like, travelled across the sky North to South  in one large group. About 50 lights, similar to what satellites look like, travelled across the sky North to South.  They were not in any sort of pattern, like a flock of  geese would be, but appeared more random.  They did not zoom and go out like a falling star nor fireworks, but travelled in a steady pattern until out of view due to tree obstruction.  Observers were patrons of a restaurant who stepped out for a smoke as well as patrons coming and going at that moment.

Silent Glowing Orange Sphere Moving in a Straight Line Witnesed Over Traverse City, Michigan.;2012-08-07 23:05:00;10 seconds;Silent Glowing Orange Sphere Moving in a Straight Line Witnesed Over Traverse City, Michigan. I took my dog outside at 11:05 PM and was looking up in the night sky (a clear night, no wind) and witnessed a glowing orange ball of light moving fairly fast across the night sky over the Holiday Hills area of Traverse City, MI. It was a single orb, glowing solid orange, and it moved steady and fairly fast. I witnessed it pass over from the treetops on my left to the treetops on my right cross the sky in a straight line. Because I did not have any other object to compare it with it is hard to tell what the altitude was, but it was not that high up in the air. It looked to be fairly low to the ground (no more than a few thousand feet). It emitted no sounds that I could hear. This was a distinctive ball shape ... not just a point of light. It did not flicker, change colors, etc. It remained constant in brightness and was distinctively orange. I've seen many satellites, the ISS, northern lights, shooting stars, and so on. I've been a lifelong observer of the night sky. I've never seen anything like this. Furthermore, I hold a Ph.D. in philosophy, teach critical thinking, and am a skeptical person by nature. This was a really unique experience for me.;44.7115851185938;-85.6666843534786
