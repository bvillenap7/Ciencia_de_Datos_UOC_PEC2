translucent football seen over city airport;1984-10-10 12:00:00;couple minutes;translucent football seen over city airport I was in Junior high school, and our school was on a high hill overlooking the city. I could see across all of Traverse city all the way to the airport. I first seen something that was almost translucent but football shaped. the day was cloudy and it was fall chilly day. I asked a friend if he seen that thing over on the horizon. He looked a bit and I pointed it out. He did see it, and we both had a wierd feeling. It wasn't a helicoptor or a plane. It did spend some time moving up and down, and around the same area. Now we do have a coast guard station at the airport, and a kid who saw us looking started looking for the object. we pointed it out to him, and he just couldn't see it. I could still see the shifting of it and moving up and down. the one kid who just couldn't see it turned sour grapes and said it was a coast guard helecoptor practicing his touch and goes. I guess It could have been, but I seen something that looked like a translucent football. Almost like a floater in your eye. One other kid seen it and a few others around seemed to be watching the area but didn't say anything. To this day I have asked a few people what they thought, and nobody has ever heard of a football translucent colored ship that was seen around traverse city airport, and I probably never will.

(almost like a group of birds flying south) The points of light resembled satellites as seen in the night sky, but the formation was strange. After about 30 second, the lights faded away. I was on the beach late on July 4th (the year Independance Day came out - everyone laughed when they heard my story) I love to look at the stars, and I had been looking at the sky for a few minuits when I saw a group of lights. They were all tiny pinpricks of light, like a satellite, but moving together in a V-shape, like birds. They all followed their own individual paths, but didn't break the V formation. The V shape also moved across the sky at a constant velocity. I am an astronomy and physics major, and I can't think of anything that can explain what I saw.;44.7115851185938;-85.6666843534786
Very large, dark object flying very low over water, moving too smoothly and silently for airplane of any kind;2002-11-01 07:20:00;3-5 minutes;Very large, dark object flying very low over water, moving too smoothly and silently for airplane of any kind At 07:20 Fri. 11/2, sitting in my car in a local parking lot, watching the snow clouds move from North to South saw what I thought was another, darker cloud moving, but realized it had a shape, sort of like a wingless C-47 cargo plane but no sound whatsoever, and it was moving AGAINST the southbound clouds. It moved first to the north, then very smoothly--no jerkiness at all--it started toward where I was sitting (I was west of it), then again moved in another direction, heading south, and one more time to the north, then it vanished without a sound. I've lived next door to our local airport for 49 years, so I know it wasn't a plane--they're never soundless, nor do they move so smoothly, and obviously cannot change direction so quickly. I don't know if anyone saw this there was a lot of traffic, but all work-bound toward downtown Traverse City. This object was no more than 500 yards away from me, and very low in the sky. Traverse City is sited on Grand Traverse Bay, and it was the bay that I was facing. I got out of my car as soon as I realized this was something unusual so that I could determine whether there was any resemblance to plane engine noise nothing but car and truck sounds, however. Size of object would have been about the size of a 777 plane, but nothing larger than a DC-10 or a very small jet can land/take off from our small airport, nor does anything fly that low over the bay (my guess would be approximately 500 hundred feet above the surface of the water, no joke)except the U.S. Navy Blue Angels, who are here each summer for a couple of days. Again, there was absolutely NO SOUND AT ALL, NONE WHATSOEVER, TOTAL QUIET as far as any plane engine, and much too smooth of moves and direction changes to have been a plane.;44.7115851185938;-85.6666843534786
Five bright large red lights in the Traverse City, Michigan, sky.;2014-08-09 22:15:00;1 minute;Five bright large red lights in the traverse city michigan sky Was going into the backyard to adjust the telescope for viewing the full moon.   Noticed 5 red lights in formation first thought was it was aircraft but then realized the lights were large and close together.   The line of sight was over some trees and I would guess that the lights were with in a mile from me and not that high in the sky.   I was yelling for my wife to witness what I was seeing but she couldn't hear me.   So, I ran to the house, and she ran out.  I would say that took less than twenty seconds for us both to be back to the spot of sight.  We witnessed one light disappear rapidly into the upper skyline at a very rapid rate not sure where the rest went.   The lights were almost like a v shape and were a constant brightness.  I am reporting this as I am hoping others in the area may have seen the same thing at a better sight advantage.   The length of time from the sighting to the red light disappearing into the night sky was less than two minutes it happened very quickly.   Wish I had had more time to observe.;44.7115851185938;-85.6666843534786

It was traveling fast, then came another and as soon as they past us they vanished.;44.7115851185938;-85.6666843534786
