We noiticed an object about the size of a quarter moon and moved at a steady pace for at of them noticed the flying object heading north to south in the eastern sky at a low-flying airplane elevation. It was defined and circular in shape appearing as if on fire or all lit up in a redish color. It made no sound as we watched it for at least 2 minutes.  As we watched it,it seemed to drift away and seemed to get smaller and smaller, then disappear. We do not know if it went behind a cloud, fizzled out, or just moved too far away. It seemed to be drifting along Shavey Road from north to south around 10:40 p.m. saturday June 16th, 2007.;42.8416;-84.5817000000001
