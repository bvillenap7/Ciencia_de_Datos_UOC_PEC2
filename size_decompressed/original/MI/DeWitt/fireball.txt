We were sitting outside in the dark on the porch, when one of my friends said, Look at that bright star behind that tree.  The 'star' was actually moving towards the east-southeast.  It looked like a small ball of fire - much like the fire of a hot air balloon, but was moving too fast to be that, nor did we hear the phoom sound you hear from a hot air balloon when they are firing it.  The elevation was that of a lower flying airplane, much lower than the stars.  Another one was following directly in it's path at the very same height and speed (not super fast, but swift like an airplane).  It seemed much lower than a jet and did not make any noise at all.  One of the people in my group thought it might be helicopters as there is an army base nearby, but no helicopter sounds could be heard.  It seemed the first one 'fizzled' out - like it went behind a cloud, but there was no cloud.  Then the 2nd one got brighter, and seemed to 'fizzle' out as well not long after.  We were all astonished!;42.8416;-84.5817000000001
