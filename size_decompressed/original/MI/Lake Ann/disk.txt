My brother, visiting from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, was taking our Golden Retrievers out for them to go the bathroom.  He quickly ran in and said that there was something in the air. I looked and saw what looked like a drone shaped object.  It wasn't an airplane or a helicopter because there was no noise.  It hovered back and forth, from the right to the left for about 5 seconds when I got out there.   The lights were red and white and were on and off from red to white.   Then it all of a sudden disappeared.;44.7321;-85.8581
