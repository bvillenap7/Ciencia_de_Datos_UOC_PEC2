Me and my co worker were out late doing feeder shifts (with lampricide)in some nearby rivers, we were talking on the road and I noticed a small light just to the right of a star in the lower sky. I said to look at it and at that time it moved real slightly just so as both of us shook it off as just nothing... but then it started to change colors. Red Green White flashing not very fast but fast enough. We both stared at each other in disbelief and sat their watching it for about a half an hour, in that time it was slowly drifting to the right going up and down still flashing and then it got more intense (brightness) and then dissapeared behind some trees ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have observed a twinkling star, but that is a guess.

Bright white light over Escanaba, MI;2009-09-11 21:00:00;60 sec.;Bright white light over Escanaba, MI A steady bright white light traveling South West to North East. Traveling very fast, much faster than any plane would travel and brighter than any star in the sky.  Not flashing as typical for any aircraft.  No sound what so ever.  Guessing approximately same altitude as a small plane might fly.  Did anyone else report this sighting tonight to you or any other Web sight?

It flashed for three seconds and stopped.  The light flashed red, yellow, and green.   We get emergency vehicles by the house, so I know if the lights are theirs, but this affected the lights in the house.
