2 long linear formations of lights spotted, lights looked like, slow speed, silent.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-24 21:05:00;5minutes;2 long linear formations of lights spotted, lights looked like, slow speed, silent, 2nd came after first disappeared, 20ish lights each Our dog was going acting like there was a dangerous animal around, growling and running around. Minutes later ,a linear formation of lights that looked like stars were spotted moving horizontally across the sky. We could not see where it came from because we didn’t see it coming , but we looked above us and saw the lights moving. It was way too long to be a plane and it was silent. Probably about 20 lights on each craft(or whatever it was). The first one flew at a slow speed over us, don’t know how high up it was, and the lights disappeared but not because they were too far to see. We don’t know where they went. After the first disappeared, a second flew over us at the same size and speed and disappeared in the same place as the first. The lights were not equally spaced apart , but they kept their place when moving. They weren’t brighter than the stars. After the formations past the dog was calm. We tried filming on our phones but it wouldn’t show up, just l! ike stars won’t show up on a iPhone camera. The dog was calm once they both passed.;45.7659;-87.089
