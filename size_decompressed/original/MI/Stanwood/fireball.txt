Orange puslating ball that flew in erratic motion.;2009-08-16 22:00:00;twice, about 2 minuets th;Orange puslating ball that flew in erratic motion. My brother and I were on our way in from a late night of fishing.  I happened to look up at sky and seen a bright orange ball.  I told my brother to look, and we were watching it pulsate, zigzag, then slowly disappear.  I didnt think much of it, but was a little creeped out as i have never seen such a thing.   When i docked the boat i went up to grab something and on my way back i saw it again!  This time it was about the size of a basketball and had a a beam of orange light it did the same thing as before, then disappeared.   What we saw made no noise at all.  Unfortunately we did not have a camera at hand.;43.6008;-85.4461000000001
