2 lights in sky;2009-02-23 06:20:00;3 minutes;2 lights in sky This Morning I saw 2 very bright lights in the sky slightly south and west of me. They were in line but slightly offset from one another.These were larger and brighter than the planet Venus has been in the early evening sky the last few weeks There was no movment but I was stareing at them because I had never seen them before, I allways look at the early morning sky. While watching them they both faded and dissapered at the same time, fairly quickly, but all the surrounding stars remained. pretty strange;42.3913474691354;-83.3699170370391

Three reddish-orange objects/lights in the sky over Livonia, MI.;2014-08-02 23:45:00;3 minutes;Three reddish-orange objects/lights in the sky over Livonia, MI. I walked out to my back yard with my dogs.  I looked towards the north and observed three reddish-orange objects/lights in the sky.  Two were in line with each other (south to north direction) and the third was slightly to the east.   I went back into the house and called my wife to come outside to see this and grabbed my cell phone (to see if I could get a couple of pictures). When we came back out, all three were in line (south to north direction) and moving slowly towards the south.  The lead one began to fade until it was no longer visible and each of the other two did the same as they reached the same spot in the sky. They made no sound. After the third one had faded away a commercial jet flew from west to east near where they faded away at a much lower altitude than what the lights were at.;42.3913474691354;-83.3699170370391

No flashing light like satellite, just one bright bright light.  Same shape as a star but moved slowly.   We watched for as long as the human eye could see.  Never dulled, no light trail behind it.  No fkashing.  Just steady moving light drifting thru the night/morning sky .;42.3913474691354;-83.3699170370391
