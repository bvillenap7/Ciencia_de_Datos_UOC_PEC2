Four stationary lights visible for two hours off Seven Mile Road, and Newburgh, in Livonia Michigan-July 2, 2015-10:p.m.-12:00a.m.;2015-07-02 22:00:00;2 hours;Four stationary lights visible for two hours off Seven Mile Road, and Newburgh, in Livonia Michigan-July 2, 2015-10:p.m.-12:00a.m. At 10:00 p.m. on July 2, 2015, I noticed four very low lights that could be seen to the northwest of Livonia, Michigan, off of Seven Mile Road and Newburgh.  They looked to be over the Northville, or Farmington Hills, area.   There were two larger lights in front that seems to be pulsating.  In the back, were two more smaller round lights that didn't seem to be pulsating.   I went inside to get my parents.  We could not make the shape out of the craft.  The four lights possibly being two large ones in the front of the craft, and two smaller ones in the back of the craft.  It was visible for about two hours.   At 12:30 a.m., on July 3, I checked back outside, after going inside for a half hour, and the lights were finally gone.  They were stationary for two hours, and no one else seemed to be outside viewing the lights in our area, they were very visible and unlike anything we have ever seen, in person, in our lifetime.  It resembled lights we had seen in previous UFO footage aired on television programs.;42.3913474691354;-83.3699170370391
Strange Lights In the Sky;2019-09-19 21:22:00;5 minutes;Strange Lights In the Sky So we had a strange night last night.  First, we saw something that I initially thought was a satellite, but it seemed much closer/bigger than a satellite should be and was definitely much brighter. My husband said it was shaped like a crescent. It seemed to move pretty quickly from south to north, then curved east and faded a few minutes later. Unfortunately, my phone was acting up all night and I wasn’t able to capture it. It was very bright, like I said, but I couldn’t tell if it was just a reflection from the sun, or if it was lit up on its own. There were no flashing, or blinking lights on it and there was no sound. About 15-20 minutes later, I noticed something else. Three to six consecutive points of light moving from north to south, but unlike an airplane, they had bursts of strobing lights (as opposed to blinking steadily) and as they moved, seemed to bounce all over the place rather than following a linear progression. I did manage to record some of it. And, oddly enough, about 10-15 minutes after that, I caught a brief glimpse of a “fireball” in the east over our house. Probably a comet, or meteor, but I cannot be sure because it only lasted a split second. I watched the planes fly overhead the rest of the night just to be sure that wasn’t what I saw. None of them came anywhere close to what I’d seen earlier. The other strange thing about this was that those things moved very quickly from north to south. If they were planes, there was no way they could have moved that fast without it being obvious that they were planes. These were tiny points of light that jumped around forwards and back, up and down, seeming to appear and disappear at different points in the sky. I’ve been checking the internet all day, but I haven’t found any similar reports in our area yet. I honestly don’t know what this was. I’ve never seen anything like it before. It definitely wasn’t fireworks either because they didn’t make any sound and I’ve never seen fireworks move like that. I thought maybe they could be drones, or something, but last I checked, drones don’t just pop in and out of sight. There were no discernible shapes, or distinct objects that I could make out.  Just the lights and it almost seemed like they were responding to each other, but I could be totally wrong about that.;42.3913474691354;-83.3699170370391
