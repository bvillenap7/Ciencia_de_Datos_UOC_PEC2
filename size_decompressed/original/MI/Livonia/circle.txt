Arriving at a party, we noted that many guests were looking skyward. We were observing tiny round, silver balls in the upper atmosphere that appeared to be stationary. Occasionally they came together to make a pattern, then flew apart but stayed in the same general area.  One of the guests remarked that he sees them all the time as he lives near Selfridge Air National Guard Base. He stated that other planes are not allowed to fly in or out when the balls are hovering. I asked what they were and he replied that no one knows. Another guest, an off duty policeman, said they were weather balloons.  I wonder if air balloons in the upper atomosphere can remain stationary in the strong winds of that level. The balls stayed in the one spot in the sky for about 1.5 hours.;42.3913474691354;-83.3699170370391
Have seen it just about every single night for two weeks straight it is not an a/c.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2020-05-11 21:00:00;Hours;Have seen it just about every single night for two weeks straight it is not an airplane it is not a star like tonight it is completely clear sky since most of the time it's in the exact same spot sometimes it's a little over to the right.  It just sits there it looks like it moves a little bit to the right and to the left and when I record it on my video camera it's like a burst of light every few seconds.;42.3913474691354;-83.3699170370391
