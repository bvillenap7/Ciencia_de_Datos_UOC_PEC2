At first thought it maybe a large bird. But as I looked on and the object got closer, I see that it's not a bird. It was like an odd triangular shape object, black with no lights.  It move in a straight trajectory above the tree line. I watched it fly over my head, and it made no sound at all. It went off further into the distance, made a quick left turn, then rapidly accelerated and disappeared into the night sky. I couldn't get my head around what I saw, and since I've only told two people, until now. Hope this helps, something.;42.3913474691354;-83.3699170370391

The size of this object would block out a full moon.   It was traveling at a very slow rate of speed.  It came form the North and was moving South.  I could see this V-shaped object for about  45 to 55 seconds.  It was directly over my house.   I called to my husband  to come quick but it was too late.  The object literally disappeared.   I had not taken my eyes off of this object.  It did not accelerate or change direction it just disappeared.  The observation from start to finish made a 45 degree angle.;42.3913474691354;-83.3699170370391

It had a light at each corner of the triangle.  When passed overhead, it had a complete circle of white lights that encompassed most of the surface of the craft. It was too dark to see the color of the craft.  The craft made no noise.  It hovered over a house, very closely, before turning and flying to the center of my acreage.  It then hovered on an angle and flew west about an acre.  It turned back east and flew about an acre before turning southwest to fly off over the lake.  It was slow moving at first and then sped up dramatically.;42.3913474691354;-83.3699170370391
