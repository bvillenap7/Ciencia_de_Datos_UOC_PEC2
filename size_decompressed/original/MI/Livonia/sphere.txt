Bright green sphere desendes rapidly  and disappears;2005-12-12 06:15:00;1 minute;Bright green sphere desendes rapidly  and disappears I saw what seamed to be the right side of an airplane wing flying extremely low.   The sphere was a bright green and I saw a flame burst from it.   At that time the object  moved to the earth very rapidly and disappeared.   It should have crashed into the earth, but there was no sign of a crash.   I called 911 ten minutes later and they had heard of no aircraft landing or crashing.   My wife told me that co-workers of hers were talking about the same green sphere that morning. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor?  The Geminid Meteor Shower peaks on December 12 and 13.

Ten spheres flying in a line from north to south in the western sky.;2012-12-25 19:35:00;12 minutes;Ten spheres flying in a line from north to south in the western sky I was outside at 19:35 trying to get the dogs to stop barking and I saw these strange lights flying in the western sky from north to south.  They did not make any sound at all.  They are moving too fast to not have engines so no they aren't hot air or weather balloons. SO, what are they?  They could stop and go in the sky too.   You can see them slowing down significantly and stopping to the southwest of my vantage point and then taking off again.    At about 19:46 they just disappeared.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9LOHkqhPnE  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPtWsChybqo.;42.3913474691354;-83.3699170370391
