It started out as a sphere that gradually developed a long plume of (seeming) aqua-green flame behind it. After the plume developed, the sphere seemed to explode in a poof and the whole object was totally gone. No trace. Before I saw object, the sky was very clear and many stars could be seen. After it appeared, the sky clouded up almost completely. 2nd sighting: I was watching a plane's lights fly through the clouds and then I saw another object like the first. A very bright green-blue sphere streaking in the northeastern sky, moving north to south. This object's plume seemed to be more flame-gold. It was smaller than first object, a little farther away at a 90 degree angle. It ,too, poofed and was gone. My background: I am a medical editor/media specialist and a freelance journalist/video producer. I am a 45 year-old female. I have never seen green fireballs before!;42.3913474691354;-83.3699170370391
Bright orange light flew quickly through air, hovered, and flew out the atmosphere quickly when a plane approached.;2011-07-22 21:00:00;7 Minutes;Bright orange light flew quickly through air, hovered, and flew out the atmosphere quickly when a plane approached. Was walking to car in church parking lot when a bright orange light was seen moving quickly through the sky, hovering what seemed like several miles over an apartment complex.  It appeared to be very close, close enough that the shape of the object was almost discerned: a dark, almost oval shape, engulfed in a bright orange light that did not flicker or change, almost like an aura over it.  A friend and myself observed the craft for approximately four minutes.  At this point it had slowed and came to a complete stop, hovering for the duration of about four minutes.  The intensity of the light did not change.  What appeared to be a jet aircraft very close to the ground (as though having just taken off) approached from the left towards the light at what appeared from our position to be a 130 degree angle.  There was about a mile's difference between the orange light and the plane.  As the plane, the orange light moved directly upward and shot away at incredibly fast! speeds.  We watched the light get smaller and smaller as it flew up through a patch of clouds and disappeared out of the atmosphere.  The time it took from the light to leave its previous location to leaving the atmosphere was approximately five seconds.  To my knowledge, there is no man made aircraft that can accomplish those speeds.  Nearly 30 minutes later, I observed three planes flying in the area the light had been previously.  We heard no sounds from the UFO,;42.3913474691354;-83.3699170370391
Flame-like bright, moving orange light and smaller, flickering light seen over Livonia, MI.;2013-09-13 21:00:00;few minutes;Flame-like bright, moving orange light and smaller, flickering light seen over Livonia, MI. Saw from moving car.  Two bright orange shapes.  One was larger than the other and reminded me of a flame.  The other was smaller and appeared as a large, flickering star. They both appeared to be moving slowly, relative to my position.  Stopped the car and got out.  Only one light was visible from new location, to the west of the moon.  Then, after a few seconds, nothing.;42.3913474691354;-83.3699170370391
Red-Orange stationary light accompanied by moving white light.;2014-07-04 22:30:00;25-30 seconds;Red-Orange stationary light accompanied by moving white light. At approximately 10:30 pm on Friday, July 4th, 2014, I stepped outside to watch my neighbor’s fireworks when I noticed a distinct orangy-red “star” in the east sky.  The object appeared to be 2-3 times larger than a star or planet, with no discernable shape, and stayed stationary during the 25-30 seconds that I observed it.   As I focused on the red object, I noticed a smaller, white object positioned at three o’clock to the red, presumably a star.  The white object appeared constant and did not flicker as a star would.   The white object than moved to a twelve o’clock position to the red, as if the red object was the pivot point.   Once the white object stopped at twelve o’clock, it stayed visible for about 2-3 seconds and then abruptly vanished.   The red star stayed visible for five seconds and then appeared to fade in a way that I would describe as waves rippling on water.  I stood for 2-3 minutes hoping it would reappear but no luck.  Due to the number of large, ma! ture trees in my neighborhood I couldn’t tell if there were more objects or if the object(s) reappeared in a different part of the sky. My location is in northwest Livonia near Seven Mile Road & Newburg.  There were quite a few local fireworks and maybe the objects I saw were somehow related to the Fourth of July festivities.   I wasn’t even going to mention this until I saw similar reports on the same night in southeastern Michigan.;42.3913474691354;-83.3699170370391
