Bright light appeared in the sky and was stationary. I opened my patio doors and watched the light for about two minutes. It never moved. I called my wife to come observe the object. We both watched it for about another two minutes. I ran and got my polaroid 1300 digital and took three pictures. My wife continued to watch the object. I went to my comuter and downloaded the pictures. I have one clear picture, one as it is turning and one displays a series of lights behind it like a long tail. I called my wife in too look at the pictures. We both agree it was something different. I went back out to take more pictures and just as I raised my camera it was gone in a flash. Due to the distance, I did not hear any type of noise. / My back yard was dark, the sky was clear, and it was not an illiusion.;42.3913474691354;-83.3699170370391
