Object too large, too close and too low while seeming to hover, then fade away.;2012-11-23 04:00:00;30 seconds;Object too large, too close and too low while seeming to hover, then fade away Shortly after 4am, I was already awake and lying in bed, when I saw lights out my window. It seemed unusual because it was low and behind a tree (but very visible) on the next property. It appeared as horizontal shape (with a slight arc or curve) which led me to believe that it was disk shaped. It appeared too large or wide and too low, making it so unusual.  There were lights and they did appear to flash, but there was no sound, which I found weird because it seems so close.  This object appeared to hover, while the lights flashed, then just seemed to disappear from sight.   I hesitate to say this for some reason, but in 1976 in Tucson, AZ., I also observed an object, at fairly close range and it just occurred to me that the lights and the shape were/ are exactly the same for both.  There was another witness in â€˜76;42.3913474691354;-83.3699170370391
