Bright white flash then gone only to appear again in a different part of the sky.;2015-10-06 22:00:00;15 minutes;Bright white flash then gone only to appear again in a different part of the sky. We went outside to let our dogs out and I was looking up and noticed that a star got really bright and went out.  This went on in different parts of the sky for about 15 minutes, a bright pulse, then nothing.  It wasn't moving in a straight line but would appear with a flash/pulse of really bright white light.  No sound.   We did see airplanes fly close to the object but nothing happened.;42.3913474691354;-83.3699170370391
