Lights In The Sky;2008-07-29 22:30:00;one hour;At about 10:30 July 29 2008 I was in my back yard with my mother when we seen something strange flying through the sky. It was to low to be an airplane seeing as there’s no airport anywhere around the area. I can’t give an exact description of the air craft but the only thing I can say for sure about it is there where about four bright lights on it I tried to get a better look at it but there was a house in the way. I figured it was a UFO because it wasn’t my first time seeing one, but I wasn’t certain.  Approximately thirty minutes after seeing that we saw something that I’ve never seen before. I was on my cell phone telling someone about what I witnessed when all of a sudden I saw some flashing lights in the sky, I told the person I was talking to I’d call them back. There where about five of them, it looked as if they where communicating back in forth. One would flash a few times, then another would flash back. The color of the lights looked electric blue. After watching for about 5 minutes they started moving faster than any helicopter, plane, jet or any man made aircraft. They where pretty far away but in a matter of seconds they where flying past our house, they were to high to get a discription of the shape but I know what I saw. That was the last time I seen them all night but personally I think It’s fascinating that they communicate that way, there is a lot of things we have yet to learn. It’s a shame that so many people think that there’s nothing else out there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));43.6002;-83.8196
