It look like a star from my distance;2003-08-21 01:30:00;3-4 min.;It look like a star from my distance I was sitting on my third story belconey looking over the north-northwest skies about 1:30 am enjoying the balmy clear nite sky watching the star's and looking for satilites. To the north looking over the Saginaw Bay I notice what I thought was a star in the lower portion of the sky. Nothing abnormal about it until it move into a loop and shot downward and upwards at about 70 degrees due north and faintly disapeared. I knew that it was not any type of aircraft, nor was no other aircraft in the vacinity at this time, because I was monitoring Cleveland Air Traffic Control Center. Where I live in Essexville MI, J-36 high altitude jet route cross over ar area. I believe this was some type of object that was sitting still for some time until it decicided to exit?
