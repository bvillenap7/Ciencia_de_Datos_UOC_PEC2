Circular object, flashing lights around perimeter, strobe like illumination.  ((anonymous report));2017-09-11 06:00:00;5 minutes;Circular object, flashing lights around perimeter, strobe like illumination. UFO Sighting, September 11, 2017, 6am, Alto, Michigan 49302    I awoke and looked out my kitchen window to see a circular object with white and red or orange lights rotating around it.  We live near an airport, so at first, I thought it was a plane, but on closer inspection it seemed round and smaller than an airplane. It moved very slowly in one direction and then hovered.  It was probably one half mile from me in the still dark morning sky.  I was looking towards the west. As it hovered, the lights went around the perimeter of the circular object rotating white/orange.  It seemed to also send out some sort of strobe light that sent a whitish illumination out into the sky around it periodically. This lasted for probably five minutes and then it just disappeared, without moving forward or backward. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
