round fuzzy light finally seen through binoculars;2004-08-05 01:00:00;10 seconds;round fuzzy light finally seen through binoculars I have reported these before but got a good look at them through 20x50 binoculars. from a distance they look like bright circles with a halo around them but as of tonight i saw two within 5 minutes of eachother. one was far to fast to see. the second i caught for about 5 seconds through the binoculars.it came from the south to southeast, fast but not zipping to much. it was sort of triangular shaped which surprised me, almost like a glowing paper airplane with pointed up wings. i finally lost it as it zipped and zagged and dissappeared. the whole thing lasted for about 10 seconds. i have my neighbors looking at them also. one of my neighbors is in search and rescue and has served in the navy for 12 years and never saw anything at sea or out like this. i love tracking sattellites and have loved astronomy since i was a boy. i cannot explain these things in the night sky yet. i will keep watching.;45.8784000000001;-87.1162000000002
