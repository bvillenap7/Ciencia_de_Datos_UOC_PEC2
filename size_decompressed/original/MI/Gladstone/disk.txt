3 UFO's spotted  in a line formation 6/25/08;2008-06-25 23:30:00;still happening about 15 ;3 UFO's spotted  in a line formation 6/25/08 My husband saw one come in first moving very fast and was very red in color.  By the time he came in to get me, object had moved to a different location in the sky, and was also accomanied by a second.  We got out the binoculars and watched them move in a very random pattern.  Every once in a while they would stop, the whole time moving or not the stayed in a line formation one on top of the other a decent yet close ways away from each other. Then a third came in out of nowhere, more faint then the other two but worked its way toward the line formation.  It was hard to tell the shape as it was night but as they moved they looked like blue lines of electricity.  When the biggest one stopped you could see a slight shape of circular and blue triangular lines showed up on its shape.  The one above it never stopped long enough to see a correct shape.  We are both from a small town, and have seen many before and they always come in three's.  We have seen them together and apart from each other so this is no unusual occurance for us.  This is the first time reporting it.  We are only reporting it now because it has happened so often.;45.8784000000001;-87.1162000000002
