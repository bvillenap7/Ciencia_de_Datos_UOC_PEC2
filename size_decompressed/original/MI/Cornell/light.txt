Last night (2-28-2011) at around 8:30 p.m., I arrived home from work.  I got out of my car and was walking to my back door when I noticed a very bright light just to the northwest of my house.  It was not at the altitude of normal jet traffic, but seemed to be at a level that small aircraft would fly.  What caught my eye was that it wasn’t traveling at the normal speed of an aircraft.  It was moving slower and it was much brighter than what a small plane looks like.  I stared at it and also noticed that it seemed to be wavering back and forth a little as it moved from the northwest to the southeast.  I watched it travel for about 2 minutes and thought that as it passed me I’d see a blinking light or something that would indicate it’s just a plane or helicopter, but all of a sudden the bright light just went out and I never saw it again.  I stayed outside for a few more minutes hoping to see it again, but it never appeared.  It was a crystal clear night with ! lots of stars out.  We live in the country and I see things all the time moving across the sky, but this was definitely something different.  Just the sheer size and brightness of the light told me it was not something normal.;45.9141;-87.2213
