Sept. 11, 2011, I was driving home when I spotted an orange light in the sky.  I thought it was a helicopter on fire. I pulled over to get a better look.  It was not a helicopter, it moved moved like no other aircraft I've seen.  I hurry home, just up the street, hollering that there were UFO's in the sky.  My neighbor, girlfriend and her son, and another neighbor all had came outside.  They too seen the lights in the sky.  It had first been one, more appeared. Six was the amount we had seen. Then on October 2, 2011, I left a friends house and just got down the street.  There those lights were in the sky again in a formation, 2 in a row, 4 long.  I hurried back to my friends house and they came out and seen the lights also.;42.2519;-83.1473
