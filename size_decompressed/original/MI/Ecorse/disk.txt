It was 1997 or 1998.  I was in Ecorse, Michigan, going through the backdoor of a friendâ€™s house, when I looked up at the night sky and saw 5 disk-like aircraft moving around one another when all of the sudden they all lined up and took off at the speed of light. It was stunning.   They were not normal aircraft or anything I have ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD));42.2519;-83.1473
