Bright light doing a 90 degree turn to come stand stationary over my house;2009-06-01 23:00:00;45 min;Bright light doing a 90 degree turn to come stand stationary over my house I was sitting outside watching the stars, seen the first object what I thought was a satelite move across the sky from the southeast to the northeast at a high altitude moving very fast(not a meteor), and a few min. later another one was doing the same thing. I thought to my self I want to know what you are you can't be a satelite next thing I know this light did a sharp angular turn in my direction, I thought how cool, so I started thinking I want to know what you are this (what ever it was) came all the way over to above my house (very high distance) and just stopped. I kept thinking I want to know what you are, but don't scare me. I have never had tunnel vision while watching anything in the sky, and my eyes started acting really weird everything went dark (in my vision) except where all I could see was this light.What ever it was stayed there for about 45 min or longer, after that I became a little concerned maybe I asked for the wrong thing and I got a little freaked out so I went inside, it was still hovering there. I have never had anything happen like this before and it was awesome!!!! but kind of scary at the same time. I only started to think  I want to know what you really are after reading that maybe mental telepathy works with them? and believe me it works. No aircraft I know of could do what I witnessed. I can't explain it but I'm really looking forward to getting back outside and watching the sky:)I've had other experiences in my 51 yrs. but nothing like this.
