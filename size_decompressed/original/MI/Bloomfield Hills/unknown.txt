Two flying aircrafts morphed into one.;2008-01-12 06:55:00;2 min;Two flying aircrafts morphed into one. I do not know too much about UFO’s, so this could just be a trick on my eyes, however I do not think it was. I was looking at the sky, when I noticed two different flying objects with blinking lights on them flying in the same direction.  I was too far away, and it was too dark out to see any sort of distinguishing marks, or the shape.  I assumed they were just planes, however they were moving very quickly towards each other.  All of a sudden the two separate flying objects had just become one.  There was no sound, or crash, or any sign of what one would assume to be a catastrophe in the sky.  The new “morphed” aircraft started flying in a straight line across the sky.  I also noticed it was moving more quickly than the average plane. The sighting took place in Michigan, it was about 40-50 degrees out.  Also the setting was in a suburb/urban community.
