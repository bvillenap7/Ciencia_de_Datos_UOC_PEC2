Fast moving, low to treeline ufo;2004-08-04 01:05:00;2 min;Fast moving, low to treeline ufo I was watching television on the couch and from the window looking to the backyard/swimming pool I saw an object up in the sky with red and blue lights. I thought this was strange because it seemed to be hovering and it was too late to be a commericial airline. I went outside and the ufo was heading in my direction. It was VERY, VERY QUICK and glided through the air, and it was quite low. The ufo was blinking red and blue lights and had a yellowish aurora of light around it. It was making a very loud humming sound as it made its way north. The shape of the object could best be described as a cone with a hexagonic/octagon type shaped top of silver color. It was a very errie sight, unlike anything I have ever seen in my life.;42.5698836206896;-83.2696275862069
