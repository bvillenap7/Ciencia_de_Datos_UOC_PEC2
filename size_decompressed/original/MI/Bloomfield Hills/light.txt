Large lights shooting across sky at extremely fast speeds;2019-10-23 00:45:00;2 seconds;Large lights shooting across sky at extremely fast speeds I was sitting on my couch watching tv.  My couch is next to a window that faces north.  I saw a light moving faster than anything I’ve ever seen.  The light would jolt across the nights sky and then vanish.  This occurred at least 6 or seven times.  The first few times I only saw it in the corner of my eye, until I decided to turn off the tv and just watch.  Was able to witness it 2-3 more times.  Large size light balls, white/yellow in color.  About 3 times the size/brightness of any other star in the sky.  Moving faster than anything I’ve ever seen.  From what I recall, all the lights were headed from east to west;42.5698836206896;-83.2696275862069
