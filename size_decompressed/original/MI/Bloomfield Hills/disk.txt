Large disk with bright lights spotted over Metro Detroit;2011-02-25 21:00:00;10 minutes;Large disk with bright lights spotted over Metro Detroit My mother and I were driving home from Target this evening, at around 9 o’clock pm, Eastern Standard Time, and were about to turn onto our street when we both noticed some bright lights in the sky. My mom asked, “What is that?” and I responded with my typical response, usually in a joking manner, “It’s a UFO!” My mom said again, more seriously, “No, really. What IS that?” I squinted to get a better look at the object, but the lights were too bright for me to really focus on it. From what I could tell, it looked like a disc shaped object with extremely bright white lights and a greenish light in the center. It was extremely close to the ground, and appeared to not be moving. There are no airports nearby. The object was about half a mile away from my house when we first spotted it. We turned onto our street and my mother decided to circle the block to see it again. However, when she looked to where it was, it had vanished! I looked outside my window and saw the object zooming across our neighbor’s house!;42.5698836206896;-83.2696275862069
