long blue cigar shape moving up into sky;2008-11-12 22:09:00;35 minutes;long blue cigar shape moving up into sky I was with my parents coming home from dinner, i am a minor so you know i was not intoxicated or anything.  it was really odd there was a light blue cigar shape in sky.  it was moving upwards in vertical motion. the whole thing was blue and from the ground it look like what three blue stars would look if they were so near each other it was like they were a line.  but it moved upwards.  no sound and my best guess that it was far from me so i did not hear it or anything.  my family did notice it too and they were also dumbfounded.  the craft thing was moving up and during the upward motion it sort of stretched and as it got longer, the light dimmed until it was no more.  i looked on a telescope too that i got for my 10 year old birthday and i saw it stretch like it was going to go real fast or something.
