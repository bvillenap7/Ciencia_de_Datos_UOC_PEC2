Internally illuminated, slow moving craft passing by at 3-400 feet.;2011-12-02 22:00:00;5 minutes;Internally illuminated, slow moving craft passing by at 3-400 feet. We witnessed an aircraft Friday evening that I could not identify. It was flying west at approximately 3-400 feet, around 60 knots. My first impression was that it was probably one of the several Piper Cubs or Cessna 150s that frequently travel low and slow in the area, but this was unique given its appearance, the time of day and (most notably) its lack of sound the craft was completely silent. Due to its lack of noise, I then suspected it was a hot air balloon, but I can say with 100% certainty there was no inflatable apparatus of any sort.  The craft was rectangular (oriented vertically) in profile, with the lower rim or base of the craft containing 8-10 orange/amber lights evenly spaced. The body of the craft had a soft glow that internally illuminated.  It was traveling at a level altitude, ruling out the theory that it was a stray inflatable/balloon. We noticed it through our front window has it passed over our neighborhood (Milford Historic District).  It was moving so slow that by the time we ran outside, it was almost 1 street over and extremely easy to see.  As it continued, I moved to our attic which allows me an unobstructed view of downtown Milford.  The craft appeared to hover briefly over the downtown, then proceeded to make a gradual northern assent until I lost visual contact. I've been an avid aviation enthusiast for 30+ years and usually have no trouble identifying aircraft.  I can say with 100% certainty that this is like nothing I have ever seen before.  Quite fantastic.  Perhaps there are something other than cars being tested at the GM proving grounds! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
