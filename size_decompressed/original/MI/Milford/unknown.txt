Milford light with at least 4 60 degree angles in a 60 degree sighting in less than 1 minute;2010-06-06 03:43:00;30 sec;Milford light with at least 4 60 degree angles in a 60 degree sighting in less than 1 minute I was outside on my balcony admiring the stars in the new area in which we moved.  I looked up to follow a blinking light that I assumed was a plane.  It was at a very high altitude as an airplane would appear and I didn't take too much notice regarding its speed as the Detroit Metro Airport is within 100 miles of our location.  We don't see many aircraft here during the day because they are generally coming during daylight hours that would contridict any visual contat.   We are also significantly distant to follow ANY sounds regarding ANY kind of aircraft, despite the occasional hovering helicopter with regards to local newsinformation. Regardless, I witnessed, at 3:43 am - 06/06/11 - a single blinking light which I originally assumed to be a local aircraft.  However, my viewing area from my balcony is extremely limited (approx. 45 degrees in total of the night sky) and within less than a minute, I viewed this light move 4 separate (min 60 degrees each) angles, in a zig/zag motion more quickly and within any range that seems possiible with any commercial aircraft, or for that matter, any aircraft that I would want to be on. I hope that this sighting will assist in either confirming or denying any possible Extra-terrestrial life. Thanks,  ((name and e-address deleted));42.5788222222223;-83.5987444444444

It hovered for about 10 seconds approximately 20,000 feet in the air, then took off at a high rate of speed stopped and hovered again for about two seconds then took off at high rate of speed.  It didn't take off like a helicopter increasing speed gradually, it took off instantly.  Was an amazing sight to see, like nothing I've ever seen before.  There was another object similar too this one with the same sort of lights but was further off.  The whole event lasted about 2 minutes.    Afterward seen numerous other aircraft in the sky, including to aircraft that were following in formation I assume military air craft checking things out.;42.5788222222223;-83.5987444444444
