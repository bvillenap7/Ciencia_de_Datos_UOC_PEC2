I looked to my right and saw a circle shaped shadow in a field near.  There was no clouds or anything to make such a pattern .  I looked around and seen that the field was bare and no structures or trees was within 300 yards from the sight .  I looked and it appeared to be nothing but a open field with nothing near the location.  I was lost in thought and returned today at 10:00 am and walked over the sight before trying to report it.  There was just a outline of one craft  that appeared to be invisible but not able to block the sunlight and appears to show its form on the ground . There was no aircraft in the vicinity.  Later a military helicopter was in the vicinity as well as a convoy of military trucks .  the helicopter flew low and was very loud.;42.4036;-86.2521
