A series of green rectangular lights in the sky.;2015-06-26 01:30:00;30 seconds;A series of green rectangular lights in the sky. A slightly bent rectangle green light flashed in the sky and was followed by three other flashes of the same light, but in faster intervals going downwards.  I could see some of the building lights from the town, but the ones I described were away from them, also at a much higher altitude.  The town I live on is right on the lake's shoreline, and the lights were in the direction of the water.  However, I'm not completely sure if it was directly above the lake since the lights seemed pretty distant. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
