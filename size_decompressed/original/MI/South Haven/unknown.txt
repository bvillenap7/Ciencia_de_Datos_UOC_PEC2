Three mettallic type objects observed over Lake Michigan at sunset south of South Haven;2007-09-02 18:00:00;5minutes;Three mettallic type objects observed over Lake Michigan at sunset south of South Haven I was at a public beach on Lake Michigan about 3 miles south of South Havenâ€™s main beach. I was watching the sun set when I noticed a light about 45% above the horizon south west of my location it was about as bright as what Venus would be at night. At first I thought it was Venus and then a few minutes later I looked at it was gone. There were no clouds in the sky so I knew clouds did not make it disappear. I then scanned the area then about 50% above the horizon to the SW over Lake Michigan I noticed a light or metallic type object half as bright as the first object and moving (SW)  in the direction or where I saw the first bright object. This object I watched for about 2 minutes then it too disappeared. I scanned the area to see if I could find it again. Then about this time a saw another object about 5% to the right of where the second object disappeared heading in the opposite direction (NE) this too disappeared after a few minutes. This area is a commercial airline route between Chicago and Detroit so it is possible what I saw was the sun reflecting of the fuselage of jets maybe at high altitude. However I did not see any wings on these objects and did not hear any sound.;42.4036;-86.2521
