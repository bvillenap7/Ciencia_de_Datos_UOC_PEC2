A large, low-hovering (not moving) craft with colored strobing lights around the bottom and it made no noise.;1991-11-01 10:00:00;5 Min;A large, low-hovering (not moving) craft with colored strobing lights around the bottom and it made no noise. There was one large triangular object hovering very low (not moving) and there was absolutely no sound.  It had strobing or flashing colored lights around the bottom of it.  It was located just to the north side of M-50 about 1/4 mile west of Britton, right near the Grace United Methodist Church.  I pulled off to the side of the road and rolled down my window to look at it.  I sat there for about 5 minutes watching it and nothing happened except the lights kept flashing.  I believe fear made me drive away - and I never mentioned it to anyone for about 10 years.  I thought people would think I was crazy.  A few years ago I started to hear about some similar reports and I finally started to mention to people that I had seen it.
