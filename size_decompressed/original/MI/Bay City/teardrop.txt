Reddish orange object heading South near James Clements;2012-11-07 23:16:00;5 seconds;Reddish orange object heading South near James Clements I was driving West on German Rd. before it turns into Bullock rd. as I witnessed an object traveling in a north to south direction. It left no trail behind, nor did it make a sound.  It was traveling at speeds that I never witnessed a manned aircraft before, hence it was only in view from my windshield for 5-6 seconds before it was out if sight.  It seemed to have a helicopter shape but was to fast to describe other than the gape of a teardrop.  The color was steady and did not change from the reddish orange light it emitted. It also was not bright but bright enough to catch my eye.;43.6065693524455;-83.9464212555625
