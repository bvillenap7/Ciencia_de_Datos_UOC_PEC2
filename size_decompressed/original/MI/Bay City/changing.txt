Two Lights varying in intensity over Bay City, MI   ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Jupiter and Venus?  PD));2012-02-22 20:58:00;2 hours;Two Lights varying in intensity over Bay City, MI My friend and I, were out on my driveway, which runs from East to West, and looking towards the West after seeing Mars and Venus to the east. That was when we noticed two bright objects in the sky. The one was due West, approximately 28 degrees elevation, the other was WNW, at approx. 56 degrees elevation. At first, we thought they were search helicopters, with how bright the lights were, but there was no sound, kind of ruled that out. Then may be a plane or jet, but as we observed them moving, it was very slow in a Northerly direction. As we watched 4 different jets came in and out of sight. One of the jets actually flew under the lower object and blotted out a part of it. The lower object was closer, it had 3 lights in triangular shape with a ring of light connecting them together. It turned when they started to moved, which was when it changed to on big light. Moved to slow to be a jet, with turning I ruled out the asteroid Eros with the changed in shape and it was stationary for about 15 minutes. The was absolutely no sounds from above until I saw the jets at various intervals. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Jupiter and Venus?  PD));43.6065693524455;-83.9464212555625
