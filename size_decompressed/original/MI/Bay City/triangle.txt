Huge non lite craft with spheres attached and trailing over Bay City Michigan.;2005-09-26 23:48:00;1 min;Huge non lite craft with spheres attached and trailing over Bay City Michigan. My brother and I were going out for a 2 mile walk at approx 2348 hrs. We stepped out the door and into my drive way. I decided to urinate outside before we started the walk. It was a crystal clear night and I was looking up at the stars in front of me whan I saw a white light drop out of the sky approx, maybe in space? I thought it was a shooting star but then as I focused my sight I seen 5 huge spheres which were not lite up, but they were reflecting light from the ground, As I kept looking at the spheres I ruled out birds as the source. I then began to scan for structure as the craf went directly over my head. I seen a brown hull with beams to which the spheres were attached. As it went over head I grabbed my brothers arm and told him to look, he also seen it and ruled out birds or plane. I got a intense feeling that we were not supposed to witness what we saw. As the craft traveled approx 100 yards past my house it just vanished? The whole time this craft was observed it was not lite up with any lights, It may have been a government project but it is hard to say how large it was and how high? It also had a large non lite sphere trailing it. The craft was moving to fast to be birds in formation, and there was no sound. At first I thought it could have been a b2 bomber? But it was way to big and the attached spheres and trailing sphere didn't make sense. My brother said he thought it was about 3 football fields long. The whole incident was very overwhelming, and my brother and I felt nausea for 2 days following the sighting.;43.6065693524455;-83.9464212555625
Large triangular craft sighted during thunderstorm.;2008-06-12 00:45:00;6:00;Large triangular craft sighted during thunderstorm. I saw one during a thunderstorm, June 12 or 13 2008 about 00:45. It flew directly overhead at about 200 to 300 feet altitude. It was triangular with a bright white light at each corner, black or dark grey in color.  In the center there was what appeared to be a circular opening with a dim redish orange glow. This circular opening was surrounded by smaller white lights.  In the center of the back edge there was a rectangular red light that didn't blink.  This craft was at least 100 feet wide. Form a distance of a mile it looked like the top of a huge a cell phone tower with bright white lights at each corner.  The lights were perpendicular, like cell phone antenna. It hovered about 200 to 300 feet above ground. As we passed it by, I noticed it was huge, way too big to be a cell phone tower, and something we had never seen before. I drove two more miles.  Dropped off my passenger at Johns Bar, and turned around.  On the way back it flew directly overhead. This event was witnessed on M-15 between Bay City and Munger Michican near Russel Rd.

We witnessed a strange aircraft that traveled much higher, faster and was a lot larger than anything we've ever seen or read about.;2013-03-30 22:00:00;3-4 seconds;We witnessed a strange aircraft that traveled much higher, faster and was a lot larger than anything we've ever seen or read about. While leaving to make a last minute grocery run at approximately 10:00 pm tonight I noticed how clear the skies were and told my husband to look at all of the stars.   After glancing to the north I saw a very large triangular-shaped aircraft traveling north 1000x faster and at least twice - three times as high as an airplane (there was a passenger jet traveling west at the same time).  My husband thought it was a shooting star at first, then noticed the six lights in a triangular shape.  There was no sound.  We ran to the end of the driveway when a tree blocked our view and it was gone.  There were no flashing lights on the bottom, sides or front.   The six lights seemed to have a bluish hue and dulled, much duller than the surrounding stars and passenger jet lights.   There is a (closed) Air Force base to our north, but this aircraft was much too large and too fast to be anything military.
