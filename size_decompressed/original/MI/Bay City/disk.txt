Disk, at night, left stream of lights, time lapse.;2005-07-23 01:56:00;3 hours;Disk, at night, left stream of lights, time lapse I was fishing in Saginaw Bay in the thumb area of Michigan.  I was fishing for catfish at about 2 in the morning.  As far as I am aware my friend and I were the only ones on the water.  We noticed a large disk in the air.  It hovered about 100 yards above us.  The UFO was directly above my boat.  The UFO was about 50 feet in diameter and 20 ft high.  Before the object appeared there was no wind but when the object appeared the water around me got incredibly choppy it nearly turned my boat over.  Then the water calmed down and the object took off at light speed and I blinked and it was gone.  It left a trail of colors like the northern lights.  The experience felt like 3 minutes but when I looked at my phone it was 5:20 am.;43.6065693524455;-83.9464212555625
