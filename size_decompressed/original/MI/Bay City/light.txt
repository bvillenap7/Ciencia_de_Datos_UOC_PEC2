Orange balls of light float across sky dropping fire that extinguishes before hitting tree level;2015-03-24 10:30:00;5 minutes;Orange balls of light float across sky dropping fire that extinguishes before hitting tree level I saw a series of orange lights moving slowly across the sky from a southerly direction toward the north.

They periodically dropped what looked like small balls of fire that extinguished before hitting tree level.;43.6065693524455;-83.9464212555625
