Barbell Shaped Object;2006-06-12 20:00:00;Hanging outside talking;Barbell Shaped Object Me and a Few friends saw what looked like a Barbell flying in the Sky in the daylight, there was a few clouds around but you could see this well. it wasnt fast like a Jet or had no trail behind it. It was a Metal looking color and My friend said that aint no UFO its a blimp but it looked nothing like a blimp. I think they were a little freaked out and in denial over seeing it. Hopefully someone else saw this too. It kind of looked like 2 tin cans and a little tube in the middle. no sound too.;43.6065693524455;-83.9464212555625
