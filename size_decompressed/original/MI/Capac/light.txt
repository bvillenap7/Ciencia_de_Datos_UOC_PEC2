I then noticed a person running across my porch. I quickly got up and looked out the door in time to see what this creature looked like as it ran around the corner of my house on the porch. It was average height, had abnormally long arms, its arms and legs were somewhat spinny. It had a larger than normal bald head. I did not get a good look at the face but I could tell that it was not human. Within a few seconds of this, the lights went out and I could see two large blue spotlights in the sky moving as if it was searching for something. They were in the field across from me about 800 ft. As the moved away, the power came back on.  This morning I called my friend to ask her if her lights were off and she told me about the blue lights and her electricity going off. She then told me that people around here don't talk about these things because they will be labled as crazy.;43.0295;-82.9331
