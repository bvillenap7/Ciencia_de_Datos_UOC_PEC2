It's much much to bright for a star and I know what a planet looks like. The light doesn't do much at all its just bright.  None the less it is something.  It look like it is either over sarnia in Canada or further north possibly over lake huron one of michigans 5 great lakes. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect one of the planets, which currently appear in the early morning hours.  PD));43.0295;-82.9331
