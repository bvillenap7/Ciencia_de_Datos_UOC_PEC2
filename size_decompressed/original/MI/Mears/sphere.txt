It then came back and shined a brilliant light back at us A white, brilliantly lit sphere flew over myself and 2 others while we were sitting out at the campfire. it passed over head slowly at at a moderately low altitude.  We got out all of our flashlights and a high powered green laser pointer which we preceded to shine/flash at the craft.  It slowly turned to the east and passed out of sight.  About 10 minutes later at 11:03 p.m. est, it came back overhead very slowly from the southeast.  There was ABSOLUTELY no noise emitted from the craft throughout the entire experience.  We all stood up to get a better look at the brilliant ball of light when what I can only describe as a porthole of intensely bright white light opened up from the mid/bottom part of the visible area on the craft and shined us back as we had shined it.  This porthole then closed again and the craft went back to its original level of brightness.  It continued to fly over us at a constant slow speed and altitude.  After it passed over us it sped up and! disappeared into the night sky over Lake Michigan heading Northwest.  No loss of time was experienced during or after the sighting.;43.6855;-86.4499
