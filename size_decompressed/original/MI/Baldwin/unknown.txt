I continued watching. It blinked off then reappeared a short distance away. It then appeared to be a red light that dipped down almost to the tree line, Then made a series of small circles. It disappeared then reappeared again a greater distance higher in the sky. I got my cell phone to call someone , looked up and it was gone. Although I thought I seen a faint trail.  To my knowledge it wasnâ€™t a satellite. Definitely not an airplane. The skies were clear. In a strange way I believe it was aware of my presence. Not sure.;43.8925;-85.881
