Orange Fireball object just above tree line in Western Michigan.;2007-08-25 22:30:00;1 minute;Orange Fireball object just above tree line in Western Michigan. On the night of 25 August 2007, at approximately 1030 pm EST, My girlfriend and I observed a orange fireball looking object just above the tree line, looking west.  The Object was quite a distance away, possibly over lake michigan.   We were looking at the stars and talking, when the object appeared.  The object moved from north, to south and rose slightly in an arching motion, then suddenly disappeared after about 1 minute.  It was very odd, but defiantly noticeable.   This object did not blink, was a solid orange fire like.   I am in the Military, and while never seeing anything like this before, know for certain that it was not an aircraft or even flare, as this appeared too quickly and disappeared to quickly.  And also how it moved was not typical of anything I have seen before.;43.8925;-85.881
