Lights moving northeast in the sky.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-17 21:30:00;45 minutes;Lights moving northeast in the sky. Saw strange lights in the sky. They made no sound. All headed in relatively the same direction, northeast. Too fast, too bright, and too many all together to be satellites. Checked flight pattern app and there was no reported air traffic overhead. Some where moving in pairs at slightly different speeds.;43.8925;-85.881
