Streaking, burning objects over Michigan ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of re-entering space debris.  PD));2004-06-26 23:00:00;15 seconds;Streaking, burning objects over Michigan While observing the moon and stars with a small telescope with the family, in the back yard, an object appeared in the western sky that looked like 2 headlights streaking across the sky.  As the object approached closer it appeared to be in the upper atmosphere and began to appear like it was breaking up, much like the pictures of the space shuttle.  The 2 objects became 9 streaking objects that passed directly overhead in a period of about 15 seconds, and having crossed the entire night sky from west to east in that time.  The objects covered an area of approx. 20% of the night sky while looking straight up at them.  I have not seen any news on this event and wonder if anyone else knows what it was or saw it!
