HUGE BRIGHT LIGHTS SILENT UNTIL RIGHT ON TOP OF YOU.;2011-04-24 23:12:00;30 seconds;HUGE BRIGHT LIGHTS SILENT UNTIL RIGHT ON TOP OF YOU. LOOKED LIKE A SUBMARINE WITH TWO BRIGHT RED LIGHTS IN FRONT AND TWO WHITE BRIGHT LIGHTS RIGHT BEHIND IT AND THEN SEVERAL VERY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHTS DOWN THE SIDE IS HOW MY DAUGHTER EXPLAINED IT TO ME.    IT WAS 11:12 AND I WAS ON MY CELL TALKING TO A FRIEND AND THERE WERE BEEPS COMING IN AND I LOOKED AT THE CLOCK AND IT WAS 11:12 AND COULD NOT FIGURE WHO WAS TRYING TO CALL ME AT THE SAME TIME THE HOUSE MADE A KIND OF SOUND VIBRATION DID NOT REALLY PAY ATTENTION UNTIL MY DAUGHTER CAME RUNNING INTO MY ROOM SAYING SHE WAS TRYING TO CALL AND THEN TOLD THE STORY ABOVE.  I THEN GOT UP AND CALLED THE AIRPORT CLOSEST TO US AND HAD NO LUCK GETING ANYONE SO CHECKED TO SEE WHAT TIME THEY HAD PLANES COMING IN AND THERE WAS ONE THAT WAS TO ARRIVE AT 11:18.  BUT MY DAUGHTER SAID IT WAS NO PLANE AS IT HAD NO WINGS AND IT STOPPED ON TOP OF THE HOUSE AND THE NOISE WAS SO LOUD SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I DID NOT HEAR IT.  SHE SAID SHE COULD HAVE THROWN A ROCK AT IT AND PROBABLY WOULD HAVE HIT IT,  THEN IT MOVED SLOWLY AWAY AND DISAPPEARED.   WE HAVE POSTED ON FACE BOOK AND I ALSO ASKED AROUND AT WORK NO ONE SEEN OR HEARD ANYTHING.  WE POSTED ON THIS SITE AS WELL AND WHEN WE CAME HOME TONIGHT WE ACTUALLY CALLED AND WERE TOLD TO REPORT TO LOCAL NEWS PLACES AND SUCH AND TO SUBMIT A DRAWING.   DO NOT KNOW HOW TO MAKE A DRAWING ON HERE BUT I THINK SHE EXPLAINED IT PRETTY GOOD.;46.7671;-88.4143
