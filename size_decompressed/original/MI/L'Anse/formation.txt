It made no sound until directly above me and it made a very loud whirring sound, it was shaped almost like a blimp it had two red lights in front and two square white extremly bright lights and four or five other bright lights on the side I could see.   It was slow moving over house then moved out of eyesight, two red lights visable then disappeared.  Tried to call local airports with no retuen calls.   Came in and asked if anyone else heard or saw it, one person thought they felt the house move or vibration.
