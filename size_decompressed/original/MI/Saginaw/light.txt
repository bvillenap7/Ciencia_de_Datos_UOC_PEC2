Commuter airliner w/ passengers turns, descends 12,500' to avoid a bizarre, extremely bright obj. directly ahead.  Obj. could jump.;1996-02-27 22:01:00;8 min.;A pilot and his 1st officer in a Beechcraft 1900 with passengers, while flying at 16,000 feet between layers of solid overcast 90 miles southeast of Saginaw, MI, suddenly see a large, bizarre ball of light appear in front of them.  They both thought it was another aircraft and were concerned that it might collide with them, so they turned on their identification lights and initiated a turn.  The object apparently was capable of jumping suddenly, perhaps as much as 20 or 30 miles within 1 second time.   The crew requested clearance to descend, which they did.  they descended to 9500 feet, but the object appeared to descend with them, staying on their now, 12:00 position.  They continued their descent to 3,500 feet, where they entered the clouds.  Another airliner, a Northwest commuter (Callsign: Masaba) witnessed the interaction.  Multiple conversations occured with Cleveland Center and Saginaw Approach about the incident.  The crew borrowed a still camera from one of the passengers, and attempted to photograph the object.  The camera and film were returned to the passenger after the photograph had been taken.  Copy of radio communication requested 04MR96 under FOIA.;43.4283361141009;-83.9767440796567
A round light in the sky hovered then moved in a perfect line from one point to another and disappeared;1998-01-10 22:10:00;5 min approx;A round light in the sky hovered then moved in a perfect line from one point to another and disappeared I was leaving my job night job at the Rite Aid drugstore in Green Acres Plaza betwwen 10pm and 10:15 pm.  It was January and it was cold, so I was sitting in my car letting it warm up.  Incidently, there was no frost, snow, or anything else on my windshield that would impair my vision, or any sight seen through that windshield.  I was just staring straight aheadand noticed movement in the sky.  A point of very bright light that was about the size that a large planet would appear in the night sky, moved quickly and deliberatly in a perfectly straight, horizontal line from the point it had been sitting at to a point an unknown distance away (it may have moved about a foot if a ruler could be held to the sky).  Upon abruptly stopping, it disappeared.  I was unsettled as I had never seen anything like this before. It was a point of light in the sky that suddenly and unexpectedly moved.  I had watched it remain inanimate for approximately 1 minute before it just took off.  It was not a meteorite or shooting star, as these don't move horizontally in such a perfect line, or with such deliberate manner.  A plane (of the kind that are seen around here, namely commercial jets) cannot possibly move that quickly.  The episode took place in the Eastern sky, the light moved from north to south, and lasted approximately five minutes....;43.4283361141009;-83.9767440796567
I woke up and saw a bright orange light hovering outside my window.;2010-10-08 02:00:00;5 Min;I woke up and saw a bright orange light hovering outside my window. I woke up at approximately 2 am after hearing my uncle cry out because he had pain related to a recent surgery.  Upon waking I saw these lights hovering outside my window a few feet away. I grabbed my cell phone and snapped a picture before attending to my uncle, when I went back to my room, the lights were gone.  We have a barn right outside the house the UFO was near the barn. We have a light attached to the outside of the barn.  A few days later my father went to change the light bulb in that light, and it was shattered.;43.4283361141009;-83.9767440796567
2 joined balls, bright fiery orange, traveling from west to east across the night sky very fast.;2015-07-04 23:00:00;~10 seconds;2 joined balls, bright fiery orange, traveling from west to east across the night sky very fast. I went out to my backyard to see if i could see some of the nearby fireworks when i noticed something else in the sky.  Coming from the western side of the sky and heading east was a bright orange object.   My first thought was that someone lit off a big fireworks rocket and it was going to go off in my full view.  But it just kept coasting across the sky on a straight horizontal line.   As it got above me, I saw that it was actually 2 orange spheres - like they were joined together.  It almost appeared like they were on fire, but there was no visible trail left behind, as it moved silently east and out of sight behind some trees.   It was moving fairly fast - the whole sighting lasted under 10 seconds.;43.4283361141009;-83.9767440796567
Shooting star type object moved quick across the sky gave off bright light before disappearing.;2016-07-11 22:30:00;30 seconds;Shooting star type object moved quick across the sky gave off bright light before disappearing. My boyfriend and I were stargazing when what appeared to be a VERY fast moving shooting star type object began moving across the sky.   As suddenly as it appeared it gave off a bright white flash and then slowly began to disappear into the mass of stars.  Shortly thereafter a plane flew by us and it looked nothing like the object we saw before. The plane had blinking lights on it and was at a much lower elevation whereas the object moved high among the stars and did not give off any flashes of light, until right before it disappeared.   Neither of us have ever seen a UFO.  We're both baffled. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.4283361141009;-83.9767440796567
