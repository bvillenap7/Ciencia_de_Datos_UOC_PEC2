bright orangecircular glowing light in the sky;2008-07-04 22:00:00;5-8 mins;bright orange circular glowing light in the sky I had just returned from a family gathering and was standing in my driveway watching the fireworks over the trees. I saw a few go off and the I noticed a orange looking light in the sky. It was not very high in the sky just a little above the line of fire for the fireworks. At first I thought it was part of the fireworks show but then it started moving in my direction. It moved right over to my neighbors driveway hovered there for about 3 minutes and then started floating upwards int he sky until it disappeared. I got the feeling that it moved towards me because I was watching it I was a little scared for a few minutes.;43.4283361141009;-83.9767440796567

It was a clear night and it looked liked they appeared as quickly as they disappeared.;43.4283361141009;-83.9767440796567
