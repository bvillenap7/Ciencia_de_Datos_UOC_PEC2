Triagular hovering UFO with a rainbow of colors flashing around it has emitted a small ball of light and disappeared over head .;2001-06-11 22:00:00;10 minutes;Triagular hovering UFO with a rainbow of colors flashing around it has emitted a small ball of light and disappeared over head . It was approximately 10:00 P.M. on Monday, June 11th, 2001. Unfortunately, my boyfreind nor I had a watch to inquire about time. We noticed a bright yellowish ball of light in the northern part of the sky. It was much larger and brighter than the northern star.  A few seconds later it was alot closer and instead of appearing as a ball of yellow light, we saw a rainbow of colors (blue, green, red, yellow) that seemed to flash around an object that was hovering. From this object we then saw a smaller yellow ball of light descend horizontally toward the ground.  The object quickly came closer and flew above us.  I could barely make out a triangular shape with red lights below each corner.  We drove 60 mph to follow it but it disappeared within 5 seconds and it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length over the telephone, and found her to be very credible.  Her description of the alleged event was quite factual and unambiguous.  We have requested a report from her friend, who was with her at the time of the sighting, as well as illustrations from both parties.  We will post the illustrations, once we begin that policy of supplementing the written reports.  PD));43.4283361141009;-83.9767440796567
Triangle shaped object, flying very low with bright white litghts;2007-08-12 22:20:00;45 seconds;Triangle shaped object, flying very low with bright white litghts I was watching TV in my living room when a bright light caught my eye coming from outside the window in an adjacent bedroom. It was as if something flashed across the sky. I quickly got up and ran over to the window to investigate. Initially when I looked out I couldn't see anything, but it was when I looked straight up that I saw it.  The object that I saw was a triangular shape with several white lights on it, 4-7 I'd say. It was extremely low moving at a steady but slow pace I was able to track it from one end of the house to looking out the window on the other end of the house for about 45 seconds.  I would say it was flying about as low as a crop duster plane would, if not lower. I heard absolutely no sound from the object. There is a small airport nearby and I often here planes fly over that are much higher than this object. It was heading North East and the airport is North West. To recap, very low, triangle shape, many bright white lights on craft, and no noise.;43.4283361141009;-83.9767440796567

There were at least 5 lights and 1 to 2 red beacon lights. No sound, no movement.;2014-01-23 19:00:00;1-2 minutes;There were at least 5 lights and 1 to 2 red beacon lights. No sound, no movement. My mom and i were going to get my brother and we had pulled out from our driveway. Then we turned and said that it was a low flying aircraft, but it wasn't moving.  Other cars around us were slowing down to see it as well. We keep driving along and i could see it from about 500 yards away and from then on we turned a corner and never saw it again.;43.4283361141009;-83.9767440796567
Triangle of red lights moving silently over Saginaw MI;2017-06-13 23:05:00;30 seconds;Triangle of red lights moving silently over Saginaw MI My wife and I were outside, laying on our deck, when I noticed 3 non-flashing red lights in an equilateral triangle heading from West to East silently, faster than anything we've seen before.  Fast enough that I was afraid to take my eyes off of it to grab my phone and take a picture or video.  The object seemed to just appear above us as I had just previously looked at the place in the sky where we noticed it, seconds before, and it wasn't there.  Within 30 seconds of my wife and I staring, it disappeared into the Eastern sky.;43.4283361141009;-83.9767440796567
