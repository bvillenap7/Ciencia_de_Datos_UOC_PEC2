fleet of saucers spotted in Saginaw,Michigan;1979-07-25 15:00:00;5-6 minutes;fleet of saucers spotted in Saginaw,Michigan It was a really hot summer afternoon. I looked out my front window and saw a fleet of what I thought were geese. As they came closer to view it looked like planes and I remember thinking maybe we were at war but then they stopped and one craft zipped from the center and went to the front then zipped back into it's formation and they all left in formation zipping in one direction.
