I was looking at the northern lights above the house.  I attempted to take a picture, but the lighting was too off for me to take a quality picture.   I turned and took a look at the nearly full moon to which I saw a tiny flash of light to the right far side of the moon.  I thought it was just a mere near by star.  I took my phone out and took some pictures, and that is when I noticed this strange blue object moving, seeming to come from behind the moon moving erratically.   I took 5 pictures, in which 4 came out clear with this rather odd object, and the last picture was just black.  The object was round, at first, but seemed to change shape ever so slightly.  It seems to have a defined outer ring with a blue center and something pulsating in the very middle.  I observed the object for about 30 seconds and than it was gone.;43.4283361141009;-83.9767440796567
