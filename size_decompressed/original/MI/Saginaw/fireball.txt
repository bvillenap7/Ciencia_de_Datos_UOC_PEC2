Large, bright  'shooting star' going from Northeast to Northwest - 18:30 - 19:15 on Halloween;2000-10-31 18:45:00;seconds;Large, bright  'shooting star' going from Northeast to Northwest - 18:30 - 19:15 on Halloween While taking my boys trick or treating for Halloween, (about 18:30 to 19:15) my wife and I had our attention attracted to a flash of light in the Northern sky (we were walking west with our boys going to houses on the North side of the street at the time.  The light was orange or white (very fast) and was moving into the west.  It lasted perhaps 3 to 4 seconds and was larger than any star or planet in the sky.  It appeared to be moving in a downward direction (as if it were landing or crashing).  No sound was heard.  Later in the evening, my thirteen year old niece stated that she also saw the 'shooting star'.  I thought nothing more of it until Artbell on 2/5/01.  Saginaw is about 90 miles North of Detroit and 70 miles northeast of Lansing.;43.4283361141009;-83.9767440796567
Orange glowing fire ball;2009-08-05 21:30:00;3 MIN;Orange glowing fire ball I was pulling up to my apartment complex and I looked to my left in the sky as the sun had already set and the night had began and I saw what I thought might have been a plane or hellicoptor but I rolled my window down but I did'nt hear any noise so I pulled in to park as I stopped to look in aw as the bright orange ball of fire pasted through silently as it floated by I saw 3 teens outside and told them to look up and they could'nt describe it either so I ran in my apartment to go get my wife so she could see it as well and she nor her cousin who was here at the time as well could not identify it. It had to be about 30 to 40 feet in the air and maybe about the size of a small car. I moved in silence and just glided through air effortlessly.;43.4283361141009;-83.9767440796567
