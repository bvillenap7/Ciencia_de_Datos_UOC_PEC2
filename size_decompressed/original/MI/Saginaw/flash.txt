More than one sighting in saginaw!;2006-02-25 09:00:00;1 minute;More than one sighting in saginaw! Well my girlfriend and i were on my porch smoking a cigarette.  i randomlly looked up in the sky and there i saw 3 quick flashes. This followed by a light in the sky moving in some pretty amazing ways. As soon as it appeared it disappeared.  This was the second time i have seen this phenomenon. The other occured, i'd say in early Feb. around 8:30 pm. I was driving with my girlfriend, and in the sky i noticed 3 flashes, then a distinct ball of light in the sky. After about 2 minutes of light movement, it simply disappeared. Today, March 12, 2006, an object apeared out of the sky and left a trail. This was seen around 4:30 pm.  Now, i'm not sure if this was a UFO, but the fact that it appeared basically out of nowhere puts a little suspision in my mind.;43.4283361141009;-83.9767440796567
