I was walking my dog down the train tracks near my house.  Sky was really clear not a single cloud in sight.  My attention was caught by what at first out of my peripherals looked like a cloud of smoke moving high over my head from the rear to the front of me.  Then when my vision focused in on the object I noticed it was about 10 or so dimly lit white lights shaped in almost like an arrow formation.  There was a water tower in which the draft flew right over that I was able to use to compare the size of the craft.  The craft seemed to be significantly higher than the water tower but was still much larger in size.  At first it did not hit me how fast the object was moving but after realizing how quickly it moved from over top of me to the horizon I come to the conclusion that it was most definitely moving faster than any aircraft I have ever seen. The fact that I would take the time out of my day to fill this report speaks for itself of how confident I am that I just witnessed something extremely odd flying in the night sky.  In my opinion the only explanation is either some military aircraft that is larger than anything the public has been told about or it was an, I feel crazy saying this, alien spaceship.
