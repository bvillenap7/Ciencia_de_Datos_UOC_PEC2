I was watching the stars and noticed whats eemed to be  tons of headlights toward the West. I informed my family who after enough convincing stopped so we could look. Theier appeared to be 2 hovering side by side. Fast blinking on-off lights. They stayed their for about 10 minutes then one seemed to be lifted staright up and about 5 seconds later the second went the opposite direction,Though my husband has alot of skeptism, my teenagers and I know what we saw and it was not created from this planet. As well it was very bright and flashy. It like hypotized you with the brilliant colors.;42.9898;-85.0754
