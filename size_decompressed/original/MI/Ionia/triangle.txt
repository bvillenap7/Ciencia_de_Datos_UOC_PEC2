Coming home from a basketball game in Palo I saw 2 UFOs flying in formation.  They were triangle shaped with three lights at each point of the triangle and one light colored dot-like thing (maybe it was a light) in the middle.  We were driving in the car traveling east towards Ionia.  It was on the southside of the car, directly above me.  I was thinking about the game and I happened to look out the window to try and see the big dipper.  And then I saw the 2 objects.  They flew together about 20-30 ft. apart, never breaking their formation.  It was kinda scary, so I stopped looking at them for a little while.  Then I had to look at them again, because I was interested.  And amazingly they were still there, as if they were following the car or something.  At first no one believed me, but then my sisters saw the same thing a few nights later and then they started to believe me too.  Now whenever I'm alone I get this insecure feeling that someone or something is watching me.;42.9898;-85.0754
