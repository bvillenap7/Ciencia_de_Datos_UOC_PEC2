I was sitting at the corner of M-21 and M-66 facing west at the traffic light getting ready to turn north on M-66.  Looking straight ahead and to the left towards the Michigan Training Unit and Supermax prisons I saw an oval shaped disk hovering in the sky above the trees about 100-125 ft.  I could tell it was metallic because of the sun shining off it. It never moved and with all the traffic I couldn't tell if it made any noise.  I quickly turned onto M-66 going north and went around the corner taking Branch St. and King St. back to M-21.  In just that short of time, it was gone, disappeared.  I kept driving on M-21 past the prisons, past Bertha Brock park, trying to see where it went.  Finally, I gave up and went back home.  I was so shook up and excited it took me awhile to calm down enough to tell my family about it.  They didn't doubt me for a minute.  This isn't the first time I've seen a UFO.  Back in the '80s when my husband and I were dating we saw one on Tuttle Road, looking towards Townsend Rd.  That one was a line of 6 lights hanging suspended in the sky.  Two of the middle lights gradually moved towards each other and then all 6 lights disappeared in a snap.  We weren't the only ones to see that one.  It was in the Ionia Sentinel Standard, a local newspaper the next day.  And when I went to get groceries the next day at Fred's Food Centre, everyone around me was talking about it.;42.9898;-85.0754
