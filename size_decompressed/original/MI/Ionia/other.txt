4 orange/yellow  lights over michigan town;2012-09-29 20:27:00;7-10 minutes;4 orange/yellow  lights over michigan town me, my brother, and our friend were outside on the evening of 10/29/2012.  we were standing in my front yard, (faces west), about 20:25 +/- my brother motions toward the sky in the north west,  ther, we all wittnessed what looked like a flame, (about the size of a pea held at arms length), flickering randomly and orangish/yellowish flicker that we all thought right away may be an aircraft on fire, so needlessly to say it had our undevided attention. O.K. when we first seen it, it moved in a long sweeping arcing motion coming in from the north west not changing in size or shape color or consistancy of the random flicker, it was between 1000 and 1500 feet.  we were watching this thing about 2/3 of the way through its arc, (now heading away toward the southwest),  my brother again motioned to the northwest, there was another, then another,  then my friend moitioned due west where we saw another one. the first 3 all followed the same track at the same speed and ! altitude,  the one in the west, that one was at the moving in tandom same apparent speed and altitude.  they were all identicle in size, shape, motion, heading, speed, altitude, and the flickering attitude.  we talked about it afterward, (the duration of this event was 8-10 minutes). there was no noise what so ever.  i contacted the ionia count sherrif today, 9/30/12, and asked if there were any reports of this type last evening, the dispatcher told me that they had no report of this.;42.9898;-85.0754
