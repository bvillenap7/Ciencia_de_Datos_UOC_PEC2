hovering craft;2002-08-11 05:00:00;20 minutes;hovering craft I was at a friends house in Belleville.  I went outside to watch the metor shower.  My friend was inside sleeping.  I was watching the metors for a while when I noticed a strange object in the sky off to my right.  It seemed to be just hovering there & was dark in color.  At first, I just passed it off as some sort of metor or a star.  But after sitting outside for a while, I noticed it was still in the same area, justhovering.  If it was a metor or str it would have been moving, because the other strs & metors in the sky were moving, but this was just hovering.  I got up from my seat and started string at it.  Then I relized it was metalic in color.  It was kind of low to the ground & just hovering there, it had kind of a dome on top of it.  Then I decided to walk closer to get a better look at it. As I was walking closer to it, it just took off & disappeared into the night sky.  This kind of gave me the chills & scred me so I ended up going in the house afterwards & not even finishing watching the metor shower.  This object was not really making any noise, except like a humming noise of some sort.;42.1955;-83.4894000000001
