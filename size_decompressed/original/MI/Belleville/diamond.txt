I was a senior in high school, and it was a very cold snowy morning.  I had been waiting at my bus stop with my neighbor.  The object was a kite shape, and each corner had a bright light that seemed to be connected by the pulsating colors between them.  It was HUGE and hovered over a corn field.  My neighbor and I tried recording it, but both of our phones froze. The object appeared to vanish, almost bleeding into the dark sky.  This morning while waiting at my bus stop, I saw something that I do believe to be an unexplained phenomena. The event lasted for a short while. I first noticed it from the corner of my eye: a bright flash of light filled the sky. My first thought was heat lighting, since there was no thunder that followed. I looked over, and the sky lit up once again! I stared in awe. I had now noticed that the sky pulsated with a red and blue light that caused the illusion of purple in some parts of it. It was so beautiful that one could mistake it for the northern lights (which was my second idea). It happened about three to four times within the timespan of less than a minute or so. I pulled out my phone to record it, but my phone wouldn't respond- and by the time I got to recording, it had stopped and my bus came moments later. I now feel a strange atmosphere and I have a feeling I have witnessed something important. I'm not sure what, but I will never forget how gorgeous it was, ! the bewilderment I felt, and what I still feel because of it.&#8203;42.1955;-83.4894000000001
