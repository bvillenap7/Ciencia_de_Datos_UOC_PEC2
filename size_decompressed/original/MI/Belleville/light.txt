To my recollection there were four of them heading west.   At first I thought it was a strange flight path for airplanes, but as I got closer, all I saw was a ball of light, four of them to my memory, heading westbound, at a fairly low altitude.  Several cars were pulled off the road taking pictures and videos.   I decided today to look on the internet and see if anyone posted pictures of these but I did not find any.  I did find one video on youtube but it was in Hartland, MI and on a different day.  The lights were the same though.   As I approached I was between Belleville road and Haggerty, and when I got to the I-275 overpass they disappeared.  I have lived here for 20+ years and am used to seeing airplanes of all kinds from Willow Run and DTW, but I cannot explain this.   For the record, I also DO NOT believe in aliens or martians.  But I still can't explain this.  I am surprised based on the number of cars that were pulled over taking pictures that I could not find any on the internet.;42.1955;-83.4894000000001
