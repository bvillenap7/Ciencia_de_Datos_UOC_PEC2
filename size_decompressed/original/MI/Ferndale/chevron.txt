Pale blue asymmetric chevron of several steady lights.;2020-10-07 21:00:00;45 seconds;Pale blue asymmetric chevron of several steady lights. We were enjoying a hot tub when directly overhead we saw a faintly lit chevron traveling about twice the speed of a plane traveling north to south.  It looked more like reflected light than light that was generated from a source.  At first I thought it might be reflected light from a flight of geese but the asymmetric chevron held an unchanging uniformity.  It was comparable in size to a full moon, maybe a bit larger.  The lights were somewhat faint and your average star like blue in color.  They were steady and unchanging.  There appeared to be maybe 4 linear lights on one side and 3 on the other side of the chevron.  We heard no sound.  I am an amature astronomer and this totally blew me away.  I have never seen anything like it.  Unfortunately we were in the hot tub so I have no images.  Would love to know if anyone else saw it.;42.4602;-83.1343
