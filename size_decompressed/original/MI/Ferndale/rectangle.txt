Rectangular object hovering over I-696 in Ferndale, Michigan;2003-10-09 07:30:00;10 minutes;Rectangular object hovering over I-696 in Ferndale, Michigan I saw the object as I drove Eastbound on I-696 towards the Woodward exit.  At first, I thought that it was a banner being pulled by a plane, but it was moving way too slow.  Then, I thought that it was a heliocopter, and that my eyes just weren't focused into the actual shape.  But as I got closer, it became evident that the object was definitely rectangular.  I couldn't make out the color because I was still at least 5 miles away from it as it moved slowly across the expressway in an Southernly direction.  I was really tempted to drive further down the expressway to get a better look, but unfortunately, I had to go to work :(  The object appeared to be at least 1000 feet up or so, and was too big to be a heliocopter and it moved very slowly, if at all as if it were just hovering.  I'm not saying that it was a UFO, but I know that I would have recognized the craft if it was anything familar like a plane or chopper.  I just want to know what it was.;42.4602;-83.1343
