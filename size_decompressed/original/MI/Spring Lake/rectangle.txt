Strange Moving Light Seen Over Spring Lake/Grand Haven, Michigan;2008-11-28 23:25:00;10 minutes;Strange Moving Light Seen Over Spring Lake/Grand Haven, Michigan We were sitting outside on a deck.  The weather was cold and it was a really clear night.  I looked through some trees and a light in the sky caught my attention.  I figured it was just a plane, or even a helicopter based on it's movements, but then I kept watching it because it was moving so sporadically.  I told my friend to look at it as well.  He thought it was odd and noted it didn't seem to be a regular plane because there were not the typical lights, such as the strobe.  We got the third person with us to come outside and look at it as well and he was just as shocked. The object moved in ways typical planes don't.  It would travel across the sky slowly, then zip ahead faster and take a nose dive quickly and sharp turns.  There appeared to be two lights on it, one blue, one red. A red color for sure. It was hard to tell just what the shape of it was because it was a few miles away no doubt.  But it appeared to almost be rectangular, or to have some type of wings across similar to a normal plane I guess. The object flew around for more then five minutes at least, then disappeared for five, then came back for probably five more minutes.   Our buddy did manage to get some video of it and a photo, but it looks like any other UFO footage caught on tape...a blurry little light moving about that's hard to make out. Needless to say, we've never seen anything like it in our lives.   We jumped in our car to try and find the place it was at, which was over the Grand River in between Grand Haven and Spring Lake.;43.0889000000001;-86.1904000000002
