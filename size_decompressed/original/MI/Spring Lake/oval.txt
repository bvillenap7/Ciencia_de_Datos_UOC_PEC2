It was moving straight and level at about 2000 ft above the ground.  It was dull gray (pewter) in color and made no sound.  It had no appendages like wings or tail.  The visibility at the time was very good.  We were about a mile or so from Lake Michigan in southern Michigan and I expect the object was moving from south to north in a line parallel to the lake.  The lake would have been to our rear.  It was at about a 45 deg angle from us and appeared oval in shape, somewhat like a dull gray metallic football.  I speculate at this time that if we could have seen it from other angles that it may have been a disc.  I estimate the size to be about 100 feet long.  It had no lights.  It was directly in front of us when we first saw it and it continued in a straight line until it was out of sight.;43.0889000000001;-86.1904000000002
