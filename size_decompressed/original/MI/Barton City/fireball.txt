I went outside to get my cat at around 2:50 am, no lights were on either inside the house or outside, just the light of the moon.  As I saw my cat walking toward me, I could see that the grass started to glow an orange color, like there was a fire nearby.  I looked up to see that there were orange lights, which I first thought to be fireworks, but there was no sound.  I was standing under a large tree, so I walked out into the open grass and saw that there were hundreds of lights turning on and off, filling up a huge circle.  They kept turning on and off over and over as I just stared at them.  Then within five minutes, all of the lights faded away until there were just two left, near the center of the circle, then they too went out.  A few moments later, I went inside the house.  I came out again within a minute, as I heard what sounded like several jets flying over my house.  Looking up at the sky, I could see no jets.  The sound went away, but came back again in a few minutes, still with no visible planes.  This sound of planes flying over repeated about three more times. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
