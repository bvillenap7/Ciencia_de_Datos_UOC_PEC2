Then it started flashing differnt colors. It flew away as fast as lighting. I was coming home from a baseball game. I was not tired, I looked up in the sky and seen a light. I thought that it was a star. Then I thought it was a comet because it was moving. Then it stoped and then continued again. It appered like it was folling me and my dad, in our car. I keep looking at it trying to make out what it was, i was not able to. Then it started to flash colors yellow,blue,red,green.... I was about ready to tell my dad to look at it, but as soon as my first word came out. It flew away as fast as lighting. Now i know a lot about science and such. And i would know what it would have been if it was. But it was not!! ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.2458096385543;-84.4006493975905
I just Filmed a Moving and Glowing Orb of energy on videotape;2000-11-22 12:00:00;40+ minutes;I just Filmed a Moving and Glowing Orb of energy on videotape Yesterday evening my brother(who lives about 12 miles away) called me and said he was looking at a UFO,I laughed and said really?(I really don`t buy into this sorta thing).Anyway low and behold I go to my window and look and there is what looks to be a really bright star in the southern sky,upon closer look it was glowing reds,blues,greens and looked to be some sort of star or fireball except IT MOVED.I then took out my camcorder and started taping it.I taped it moving (in slow zig-zags,angles and twice it shot from one place to another and stopped on a dime,the speed during these shooting times was like a meteors speed). I zoomed in (320x digital zoom) a few times and what I saw(and recorded) was a yellowish nucleous with some sort of colored energy bands or radiation coming from it,on both the left and right sides there is something shaped half circular and is pitch black and has no color yet the radiant color spills all around the orb except in these spots.I have the tape and I don`t know the first thing about what to do with it.Anyway, get back at me people,I`m flippin my lid trying rationalize this. ((NUFORC Note:  Report is reminiscent of twinkling star, or Jupiter, which is in that area of the sky at present.  PD));42.2458096385543;-84.4006493975905
Very bright light from east, shoots off in to north sky?;2001-01-05 20:00:00;30sec-5min;Very bright light from east, shoots off in to north sky? Driving east on I-94, just past Sargent road I saw a light I thought was a planet just above the horizon at one o'clock my driving direction. This light started very small and was very bright. I was driving about 65 mph, I rolled down the window, it was pretty warm. After Willis road the light was nickel sized at arms length and at eleven o'clock above my side view mirror. At the Weigh Station (it was open), the light was at nine o'clock, half-dollar sized, very bright. Suddenly, it shot straight up, leaving a bright streak on my eye, it was gone. It dissappeared, it didn't fade out. It kind of freaked me out, I felt scared and very emotional. It felt like a couple of seconds, but it was at least 3-4 miles of driving at 65mph? As I was watching I noticed partly cloudy conditions, with clear above that. A couple of planes at average altitudes with blinking lights were coming from east and west. I kept expecting to see airplane lights on this light. From several angles there were no other lights or form. At the brightest, this light had a dark band in the middle that could be seen. Upon driving back past this area, Waterloo Recreation area, I noticed that it is a particularly dark area (between Ann Arbor and Jackson) no towers or airports in this area. Did anyone else see this?;42.2458096385543;-84.4006493975905

Strange fast moving light in southern Michigan;2012-03-18 07:00:00;2-3 minutes;Strange fast moving light in southern Michigan My friend and me were getting ready to head back out and finish the rest of the newspaper route.  We were standing outside of the car in my driveway and were looking at the sky because we kept seeing lightning off in the distance. My friend then said, What the hell is that?  He pointed and we looked in a southwest direction at a light that was moving very fast.  There were no other lights on it other than the light that we watched. It moved quite fast and made no sound as it traveled in a northeast direction.  The odd thing is that this strange thing followed a straight line but was wobbling like it was caught in the wind, or something like that.;42.2458096385543;-84.4006493975905

I was nearly home when I noticed the light over the trailer park.  I didn't think much about it, until I seen it start to move in an almost zig-zag motion.  It hovered about 60-100 meters above the houses for sometime, until it stopped.   After it stopped, there was a flash that lit the sky, then it vanished.  There were no noises, from birds, dogs, anything up until there was no more light in the sky.;42.2458096385543;-84.4006493975905

Multiple sightings of different type objects over Jackson, Michigan;2019-03-25 22:00:00;48 minutes;Multiple sightings of different type objects over Jackson, Michigan My fiancé and I were in the hot tub on Monday 3/25/19 in Jackson, Michigan, at approximately 10 PM.  It was a clear night with many stars visible.  We were looking in the direction of Orion’s Belt to the Southwest, when we saw a line formation directly overhead, consisting of 6 lights, traveling from East to West, at a high rate of speed.  From directly overhead to out of sight to the west took about 4 to 5 seconds.  It appeared to be a long thin illuminated light shaft with 6 distinct circular lights evenly spaced along the shaft.  It disappeared into the western sky. This was followed several minutes later by a similar sighting basically following the first one’s path. Then several minutes later there were two more that traversed Southeast to Northwest and then another few minutes passed, when we saw two more traveling North to South. Next, a V formation of lights, 3 or 4 lights on each side of the V, was seen traveling East to West, basically following the path of the first light shaft. ,This was followed by a similar, or the same, V light formation traveling from SE to NW.  Then there was a larger V formation traveling E to W. ,Then a few minutes passed before one larger circular or spherical illuminated object was observed rapidly traveling East to West along the same path as the V formations. ,Several minutes later, another two V-shaped objects, one following the other, were observed traveling NE to SW. ,And then after a few minutes, one more V was observed traveling W to E low in the Southern sky. Shortly after the last sighting, we saw a commercial jet aircraft, traveling N to S, at an estimated altitude of 20,000 feet based on the relative size of its navigation lights.  Based on this, the unidentified formations were above this at around 30,000 feet. Sightings ended at 10:48. I am a former Navy submarine officer and retired engineer.  My fiance'is a retired practical nurse and massage therapist.;42.2458096385543;-84.4006493975905
Bright, stationary light north of my house that  suddenly disappeared.;2020-08-12 03:30:00;1-2 seconds;Bright, stationary light north of my house that  suddenly disappeared. I woke up around 3:15 am.  I had my door open to my balcony outside and saw a bright, stationary light that caught my eye.  Looked like a porch light in the sky (north of my house).  As soon as I started to really question what was I looking at it suddenly disappeared, it was like it turned off it's light . Just gone.  I got up to check if it was cloudy out but I could see faint stars and about 10 minutes later a plane flew through where the light was.  Not sure what I saw.  A friend suggested I contact this site.;42.2458096385543;-84.4006493975905
