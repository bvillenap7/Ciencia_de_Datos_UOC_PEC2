Sapphire teardrop falls from sky and disappears behind treeline.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));2017-12-01 19:35:00;3 seconds;Sapphire teardrop falls from sky and disappears behind treeline. I was driving south along Hague Avenue past Jackson Community College at night, when I saw a streak come straight down in a falling motion that resembled a shooting star, though the color was a spectacular sapphire blue.   At the end of the streak, closest to the ground, there was a large teardrop shaped light which disappeared when it reached the treeline.  The whole even lasted only a few seconds. I was the only person in the vehicle at the time of the event.   As for my background, I was raised in a nearby area and am currently employed as a social worker.  I have a graduate degree from CMU.  I commute this route down Hague Avenue on the way home each night.;42.2458096385543;-84.4006493975905
