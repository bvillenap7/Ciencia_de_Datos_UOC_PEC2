Formation of 3 lights heading SE, appeared to be fast and low altitude with no noise detectable. ((NUFORC Note:  NOSS satellites?  PD));2004-09-07 21:45:00;5 seconds;Formation of 3 lights heading SE, appeared to be fast and low altitude with no noise detectable. Three lights in a triangular or vee formation passed overhead from NW to SE. They were initially observed overhead and proceeded SE in a straight line until they were no longer visible. The sky was clear except for some clouds low in the sky far to the east. The lights were a steady off-white color, not as bright as aircraft lights (several of which were visible at the same time in other parts of the sky.) NO navigation lights were observed. The lights appeared to be slightly smaller than a No. 2 pencil eraser held at arms length. The western light was about 8 eraser widths from the lead light and the eastern light was about twice that distance. They did not appear to be connected stars were visible between the lights. There was no noise that we heard. They appeared to be lower than the other aircraft in the area and if that is the case they were travelling very fast to go from overhead to out of sight that quickly. Observers are a 51 year old female, administrative assistant for a major gas and electric utility and a 63 year old male, retired engineer, former Navy submarine officer and amateur astronomer.;42.2458096385543;-84.4006493975905
Two perfect lights move in perfect formation with no sound across the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.  PD));2009-09-08 21:15:00;5 min;Two perfect lights move in perfect formation with no sound across the sky At approximate time and date above I witness two air craft of known shape flying in a straight line formation from west to east.  Front craft was lighter dimmer light then went brighter towards the approach overhead.  Second light much brighter and stayed that way until it left sight.  First light got just as bright as the first then faded out then second light followed doing the same.  Both crafts did not make a sound and where flying lower than 30 k because jets where flying over head.  I one time one witness believe that one plane did turn to observe the crafts.  I have seen satelites before and thought they were, but they obsely not high enough.  Shooting stars/meteors fall or move much quicker than the formation did.  Judging by the commercial plans above the formation was between 15 - 20k feet.  And traveled the distance from above horizon 20 degrees to 20 degrees the other direction in about 45 seconds to 1 min.  The lights where about 1 inch perfect ! apart from each other.
