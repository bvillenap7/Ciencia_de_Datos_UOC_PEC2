At 5:02 AM while standing at my back door I saw a what I thought was a plane at first. As it got closer I noticed it had 3 white lights forming a triangle. None of the lights were blinking. It was moving very fast to the East.  Maybe 15degrees from over head to the South. No sound was heard, and it just disappeared. No clouds in the area at all.;42.2458096385543;-84.4006493975905
