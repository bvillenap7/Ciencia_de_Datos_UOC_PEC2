Me my sister and two neighbor kids were out in the yard playing, when one of us noticed this orange ball of light coming from behind us not to far over the tree tops.  We had this tall hill behind our house and our house was on a hill so you could see this coming from a good distance.   As we stood and watched this fly over top of us you could see the ball of fire rolling and you could here the sound of crackling like you would a fire.  It wasn't loud you could just here the crackling as it slowly went over us.  I've never seen anything like this again, nor have I heard of anyone witnessing this before.

It changed about 3 different colors started out as white, changed into red, green , then a blue color. at that time i looked at my friend and said what the hell is that! Then all the sudden the sky lite up like lightning does, and it was gone. my friend started crying and told me he wanted to get the hell out of there , but i managed to calm him down. But at the same time i was shaking very nervously. I still don't know what that was exactly,i know it definetly wansn't a meteor or any kind of plane. i just wish that i had a camera on me that day.
