fast moving over Michigan;2001-04-26 20:10:00;8minutes;fast moving over Michigan At aprox. 8:10pm I noticed a contrail being made in the northern sky.  The object making the trail was moving extreamly fast.  Three or four times as fast as a jet plane and at an altitude (guessing) of maybe 20 to 25,000 ft., it was going south.  Then at that speed, it made a 180 degree turn within 3 seconds, still leaving a trail.  Then about 5 seconds after it turned it disappeared.  I kept looking for about a minute or so and saw the object again, (no trail) going west then east then west again, all in a span of ten or fifteen seconds, then disappered.;42.2458096385543;-84.4006493975905

I am from Horton, Michigan, just south of Jackson, Michigan.  Last weekend I saw something that I will never ever forget. It was the night (or morning rather) of the huge snow storm, January 5, 2014.  I am a security guard and was stationed at Tenneco in Grass Lake, Michigan until 11:00pm.  At 10:40pm my relief called to tell me that he was stuck and was unable to get to work.  I offered to come pull him out with my 4x4 F-150, but I also got stuck.  We made it back to our work and were going to wait it out when I found someone to pull my truck out.  After getting un-stuck,  I got on I-94 via exit 150 heading west towards my house.  I realized that it was 3:45 am (January 6, 2014 at this point) and that Coast to Coast was on, so I turned on the radio and started to listen. After a few minutes of driving, and after passing exit 145,  I noticed that I could see what I can only describe as columns of light in the sky.  At first I just saw one, and thought it was a spot light.  But then I notice a couple of others.  It seemed strange and being that I was listening to Coast to Coast, my mind was open to all sorts of possibilities and I paid attention to every detail.  They didn’t seem to start from the sky nor from the ground, they were just there.  The light was not super bright, which is why I did not notice it at first.  There were nine of them, spaced equally apart, the same distance from me, and all the same brightness, surrounding me in a semi-circle.  There may have been some behind me, but I didn’t turn around to look because I was driving in dangerous weather.  Anyways, the columns of light were like perfect cylinders, the same width throughout. I couldn’t tell how far away or how wide they were. This is when it got even stranger.  Since it was still snowing, the sky was rather dark, although I could see a few stars through a couple breaks in the clouds.  I noticed a peculiar star and I realized that it wasn’t a star but a plane, because the light started blinking (as lights on planes do).  I watched it travel across the sky when all of a sudden it seemed to skip the whole horizon.  It started on my right (I saw it through the very right side of the windshield) and I watched it blink about five or six times and then stopped blinking for one or two seconds and all of a sudden was way to left (outside of the driver’s side window) and continued to blink. The whole time this was happening,  I could still see the beams of light.  I could see them for the whole drive home, about 35 minutes, until I turned off of the highway and started driving on back-roads through the country where the trees were blocking my view.;42.2458096385543;-84.4006493975905

It just had turned dark outside. We saw a long line moving from the northwest to the southeast. It first looked like a contrail from a plane to me but it was moving at a good pace.  We saw flickering within the line. It is impossible to say how big it was but it was above the clouds so it makes me think that it was massive in length.;42.2458096385543;-84.4006493975905
