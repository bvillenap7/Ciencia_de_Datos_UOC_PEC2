Millenial Falcon-like craft enters cumulus cloud in broad daylight in Jackson, MI on July 9, 2012.;2012-07-09 16:00:00;5 seconds;Millenial Falcon-like craft enters cumulus cloud in broad daylight in Jackson, MI on July 9, 2012. I was driving west on I-94 just off of South US-127 from Lansing and heading towards Jackson, MI.  The sun was shining brightly, but a huge cumulus cloud very low to the ground covered the southern area south of Business 94.   A craft approximately the size and shape of the Millennial Falcon (from George Lucas's Star Wars movies) appeared just above the cumulus cloud and performed a perfect loop-de-loop head straight down to earth and back into the cumulus cloud where the craft disappeared.  I never saw the craft again.   The color was tan just like the craft from Star Wars.   I know the shape, because I had a model of the craft that I never finished.   Imagine my surprise to see this!  The craft was handled smoothly in the loop-de-loop.;42.2458096385543;-84.4006493975905

Noticed a red and yellow and red light with a flashing green light almost in the shape of a triangle.;2014-05-24 02:50:00;2 minutes;My friends and I were watching the meteor shower when I noticed a red and yellow and red light with a flashing green light almost in the shape of a triangle, though I could make out a saucer shape until it got further away.   When it gained some distance I was swerving back and forth.   After that it wad hidden by trees. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Multiple balls of fire moving twice as fast as planes in a triangular pattern. Two were not lit and hovered and we're moving slower.;2020-08-29 20:50:00;8 minutes;Multiple balls of fire moving twice as fast as planes in a triangular pattern.  Two were not lit and hovered and we're moving slower. 3 objects that appeared to be a ball of fire, triangular in formation traveling at what appeared twice the speed of a plane moving northwest to southeast.  Another one followed that was not lit, appeared to be metallic in color and disc-shaped.  That object then stopped and hovered in place as 3 more came from the same direction and speed as the first set.  Once the 3 passed this object it then caught up to them and continued but only the other 3 appeared to have the ball of fire. 2 more appeared, one lit and the other not. The one that was not lit was much closer to the ground and you could distinctly see the disc shape and underneath, on the bottom of the object was 3 small disc shapes and what appeared to be a cockpit looking object in the middle of the small discs.  Our windows were open and no sound was heard.;42.2458096385543;-84.4006493975905
