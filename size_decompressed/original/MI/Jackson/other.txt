I saw an object/light in the sky unlike any others I have ever heard of.;2006-09-18 21:00:00;2 to 3 hours;I saw an object/light in the sky unlike any others I have ever heard of. I was headed north on I-140 about 8 to ten miles south of I-94 at about 8:45 p.m. on 9/18/2006.  I noticed a bright blue light flashing every second or two on my right. I thought it quite strange to have a light like those used as airports in a farmers field, but forgot about it.  When I noticed it a mile or to later it was in the same place in my passenger side window. When I noticed it again it seemed as though it was flashing once in one spot next second many miles away.  Then a few miles south of I-94 I noticed it remained in one spot perhaps one hundred yards above a farmfield. It no longer looked like only a small blue flashing light but hundreds of times larger and every time it flashed I could clearly see a massive square structure made up of transparent tubes of a variety of sizes at the bottom.  I continued to see it flash west on I-94 all the way to past the kalamazoo river and jackson. I did capture digital photographs from far away when driving.  The images I got were nowhere near as clear or amazing as what I saw looming large above my vehicle, but very interesting even so.;42.2458096385543;-84.4006493975905
