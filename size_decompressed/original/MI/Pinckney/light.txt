My friend ((name deleted)) and I were standing on the dock and noticed seveal lights approaching from the west , they were quite high- estimated at at least 20,000 ft. They were travelling at a very high rate of speed, and approx 70 degrees overhead, they slowed and almost stopped.They were flying in a V formation. several minutes after the initial sighting, comin from the same direction that the lights had come from, several more lights appeared going toward the lights. We soon recognized these to be jet planes(presumably military). As they got closer to the lights, the UFOs departed at an incredible rate of speed, leaving the chase planes far behind. The time frame for the ufos to dissapear from overhead to the horizon was maybe 3-5 seconds. The planes remained in the general area flying a search type grid for 10 minutes more, and then returned back in the direction they had come from. Within the next several days we talked to a number of other people who lived in the area within a 10 mile radius of where we were, and they had witnessed the same objects, complete with chase planes as we had within the same time frame. I am sorry the date is only an estimate, I have never documented the incident until now. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.458;-83.9056

Thought it was aircraft at first, but then I noticed the lights, left to right with no gaps in timing. There were other aircraft in the area but not traveling in its direction.;42.458;-83.9056

I ran up to see,and it was a shining silver light.  It sat in the sky hovering then vanished.  It repeated this twice then shot to the sky, we watched the light for 30sec. before it vanished in the sky for good.
