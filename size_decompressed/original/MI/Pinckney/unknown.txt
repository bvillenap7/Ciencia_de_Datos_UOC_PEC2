Me, My sister, our friend and my dad were out in our yard having a bonfire. It was a lovely night to be outside. The sky was full of stars and it was nice and warm.  Me, My sister and our friend wanted to go inside to get some marshmallows and hot dogs but we did not bring out a flashlight and I like to have a flashlight in the dark so we were going to the shed to get a flashlight the shed is only about 10 feet or so from the fire pit.  So we walked in got the flash light and walked out with me in front then our friend then my sister as i stepped out I saw two bright lights directly over us we could have reached up and touched it the shed is not that tall and it was probably at the same height as the top of the shed or a little below the top.  I thought I was the only one who saw it but I found out different.  We were astounded at it.  It could not have been a plane or anything of that sort it made no sound it was completely silent and no plane is that small and no plane makes no sound and no plane could get that close. more mysterious is the lights were there for so short yet there was no sight of anything coming or leaving. just the lights.  We wondered if my dad had seen this or anything he might have been able to tell us so we knew what it was.  He had seen nothing.  We all saw it. my dad didn't, yet he was only 10 feet or so away from us.  It bugged me what it could have been I have no answer but I know it probably was nothing known to our society.
