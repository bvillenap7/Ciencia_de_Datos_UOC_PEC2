2 or 3 star like objects in night sky, but not stars or satellites. Kept moving back and forth/up and down.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??));2020-03-14 00:28:00;4 minutes;2 or 3 star like objects in night sky, but not stars or satellites.  Kept moving back and forth/up and down Woke up at quarter or so after midnight to use bathroom.  Back in bed curtain to window was open and a weird twinkle in sky caught might eye.  Immediately got a feeling of strangeness and got up to look: thought these were bright stars or satellites, but they kept blipping then moving back and forth quickly with very tiny lights that would flash next to them.  Would also move up and down.  I watched for a few minutes to make sure what I saw was not aircraft or tricks on my eyes.  Definitely ufo of some kind.  The light they emitted was strange, like a star but would almost go a dark blue opalescent but I could see it against the blackness of the dark sky.  Two craft but I might have seen 3.  To be honest I lost interest because it was unique but no one else to share experience.  But still in my mind  I figured I would report.  South west direction, mid to low in sky.  Too bright to be stars that would be there, I know the night sky well and Iâ€™ve never seen bright stars! in that area of sky.  Not to mention moving back and forth and overall strange feeling it gave me that this was not normal.;44.3802;-83.8309
