cigar like objects going at high rates of speed;2007-09-02 23:00:00;2-3 min;cigar like objects going at high rates of speed My husband and I were on our way home from the neighbors house (walking) when we looked up at the stars. Because we have seen these fast moving things before, we were looking again to see if we could spot them again. Within about 5 minutes or so we spotted one which was very bright off-white cigar shaped object that was going south to north direction at high speed. Within a short time anouther one of these objects came into view, however it was going slow, then stopped. That one did not move again from the time we seen it to the time we went home. The other two were seen at the same time, going really close to eachother, then continued on in oposite directions. The only difference in these ones compared to our very first sighting is the shape of the objects. Once again these objects were moving at high rates of speed, no noise at all. Not sure if my camera is strong enough to catch these objects, but were going to try it on the next clear night we have. I also will send drawings of what we first seen and these ones tomorow.;46.3315;-87.4449
