Triangle UFO Sighting Near Gwinn, MI.;1998-05-01 22:00:00;1 minute;Triangle UFO Sighting Near Gwinn, MI. My boyfriend and I noticed one very bright, white light in the distance as we headed South on St Hwy M-553 on our way to Gwinn, MI.  As we passed the entrance to KI Sawyer Airforce Base, we could see that the light was huge, super bright, very low (just barely above the pine trees) and stationary.  It never moved!    As we neared Southgate Road, we approached the light.  Slowing down directly in front of it, I could plainly see that this object was triangular in shape.  It had one central bright white light (the one we noticed from the distance), as well as one small blue light on the left, and a small red light on the right.   My boyfriend and I couldn't believe our eyes!   We quickly turned his truck at the start of Southgate Rd to get a better look.  I had turned my head to keep my eyes upon this fascinating object.  As he turned the truck, I quickly turned my head to face the object- and it was gone!  I only took my eyes off of it for a split second- and it was NOWHERE TO BE SEEN!  It totally vanished!   Please keep in mind that KI Sawyer Airforce Base shut down all operations and closed on September 30, 1995.  It was an uninhabited ghost town in 1998, when we witnessed this object.
