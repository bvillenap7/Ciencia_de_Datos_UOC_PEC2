Many blinking objects moving at high speed, red and white lights observed 2 nights in a row in upper MI  ((NUFORC Note:  Stars??  PD));2007-07-07 01:00:00;aprox 2-3 hours per night;Many blinking objects moving at high speed, red and white lights observed two nights in a row in upper MI My husband and I moved here two weeks ago and noticed that we can see the stars clearly unlike the place we lived prior.  The first night we seen objects in the sky was over at a neighbor's house. The objects looked at first like twinkling star's, however they had bright red and white lights on them. My neighbor being airforce, and my husband being ex military brought up a good point, no aircraft on earth could be that high up in the sky and move that fast. The night was very clear on 07-06-07, truly amazing to see these objects. Anouther thing that we were thinking, no aircraft here can change direction at a 90degree angle going that fast. Tonight we brought out several other people, one adult and three older children to see if they see the same things. The adult thought we were out of our minds, but is now a believer once he seen them for himself. Now to let you know, there is a very small airport around here, however we hear and see them land and take off. We know what the lights look like from those, and can say that the objects we seen were nothing like an airplane. Tonight when an airplane did fly over, it took about 8-10 minutes to leave our sight, where as these objects are going at a much higher speed and are constantly changing direction. Right before we came inside for the night it became cloudy. We could no longer see any of these object's, however once again when a plane flew over, we could see the light's through the clouds. This in turn means to us that these objects are above the clouds beyond our vision.;46.3315;-87.4449
