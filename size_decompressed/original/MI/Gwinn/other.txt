I walked into the woods and when I came back all 6 of us saw 4 amber lights in the sky.  They appeared to be in the shape of a trapezoid, but then shifted in a triangle formation, with 2 of the lights on the bottom coming together.  Shortly after, the 2 lights on the left faded out, followed by the other 2 on the right.   We have video of it as it has already been posted on Facebook and shared on my Facebook account.  I believe that if I had brought an infrared camera I may have been able to see the 4 lights as I believe they may be boosters.  The technology on this thing was amazing though.  The the way it moved showed it had anti-inertia technology.   I just wanted to report this information and hope that it gets passed on to Bigelow Aerospace for review.   I've noticed in other UFO reports and videos that a lot of them represent a similar shape, the triangle.  I also know that that symbol has been seen on many artifacts found all over the world that are 10,000-12,000 years old.   If you look in the video, it looks like there is a very faint beam connecting the 2 lights with each other on the left and a separate beam on the right pair as well.   I spoke with another witness from near by and determined from the direction she was looking and the location she was looking from that it was about 400 yards away.
