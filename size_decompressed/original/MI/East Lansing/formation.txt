triangle formation of 3 saucers in East Lansing.;2001-04-13 22:30:00;5 seconds;triangle formation of 3 saucers in East Lansing. I was walking around my town at night around 10:30 on April 13.  I glanced up in the clear sky and saw a triangle formation of 3 saucer shaped objects. The saucers flew overhead silently and very quickly.  I have seen these saucers more times than I can remember in East lansing.  They seem to be a pretty common occurance.  They always fly silently, but at varying speeds.  Sometimes they fly so fast it seems impossible. ((NUFORC Note:  We are not aware that saucers fly over this part of Michigan with the frequency implied in the report.  PD));42.7351897142858;-84.476658857143
