5-6 Black Diamond shaped Silent Objects;2000-11-15 14:00:00;10 sec;5-6 Black Diamond shaped Silent Objects What I saw in the sky was 5-6 Black diamond shaped floating objects. They were flying in a syncronized fashion with a centralized some-what larger  black diamond shaped one in the middle. They were floating south south-west,north-north east right at the top of the tree tops. They were close enough to hear if they made a sound but they were silent. It was a clear blue sky and it just so happened that when it flew by at about 35-40 miles an hour no one else was on the road where I witnessed them. The smaller ones were about the size of about 3 full size vans. The larger one was about 2-3 times bigger then the smaller ones. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
