Green flare like object streaked from SWW to NEE	;1999-11-16 19:00:00;20 seconds;Green flare like object streaked from SWW to NEE	 I noticed a green flare like object streaking from the SWW to the NEE at 7pm.  At first I thought it was a firework, but it was maintaining a horizontal path from horizon to horizon.  I would characterize it as something entering the atmosphere except it appeared to be lower than normal 747 style traffic, or it was quite large, but the detail in the flame would make me believe that it was closer to the ground that far away.  Also there where small orange lights coming out the back.  I believed it to be ember type material breaking away but the lights fell directly back, one at a time evening spaced and they didnt fall away as I would expect waste material to do.  They were evenly spaced and fell directly behind the object, but still seemed to be keeping up with the green flame which is why I think it was not just a meteorite.  Apparently from the number of calls you were getting many people seen it,  i was in my car pulling out of a coffee shop at the time so I dont know if it made noise.  there were probably 10 to 15 people seated outside the coffee shop and I noticed that all of them were up and looking as well.;42.7351897142858;-84.476658857143
Object with orange lights turned and did 2 very fast circles;2012-07-17 21:30:00;30 seconds;object with orange lights turned and did 2 very fast circles Two of us sitting outside saw what looked like a shooting star go part way across the sky and then stop. It then turned 90 degrees and proceeded southward then quickly made a circle went further south and circled again. It then proceeded south out of view. Everything lasted about 30 seconds and the circles were too fast for any jet. We did not hear any sound or motor. It seemed to have 2 or 3 lights orange or yellow. We both thought it was maybe 20,000 feet high but the circles were done so quickly I think it must have been much lower. We both can not logically explain what we saw and it does not fit any flying object we are aware of. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
