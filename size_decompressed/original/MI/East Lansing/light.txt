Satellite type objects just faded out of sight (existence?);2002-06-06 23:45:00;10 minutes;Satellite type objects just faded out of sight (existence?) Outside on a clear sky watching the stars, saw a satellite, watched it move slowly away, no big deal.  Saw another one, or so I thought, however this one moved sort of in a curve and faded out.  I assumed its reflection of the sun had been blocked by the earth until I saw another one in the same eastern part of the sky.  Then when walking back to my main apartment door I saw another one Due North, much brighter, became very bright like when a plane turns towards you.  However this one, Also disappeared.

On June 07, 2002, he retracted, and stated that the prediction had been a hoax, designed to show how gullible human beings can be regarding the UFO phenomenon.
