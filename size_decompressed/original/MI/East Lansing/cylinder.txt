Cylinder cigar shaped object over East Lansing, MI.;2008-10-03 11:15:00;5 minutes;Cylinder cigar shaped object over East Lansing, MI. Features of object:  Length: 50 feet?  Width: 20 feet?  Color: Changed from blue to purple to orange and yellow. Features: Long fat cigar shape with fluttering wings on side. Myself and five others witnessed this object in the sky around 11:15Pm on Oct. 3rd 2008 in East Lansing, MI.  The object appeared out of nowhere and out first thought was that it could be a helicopter.  The object made no noise and just sat there with objects wings? on the side of it moving in a constant slow wave like pattern. It sat there for a long time (5 minutes) and slowly was changing color. After about five minutes the object darted towards the south at a high rate of speed.  The objects on the side of the craft “fluttering wings” started moving more rapidly before the craft darted off.  It changed colors constantly and was very creepy.  I personally was a little scared not knowing what it was and had the feeling that it was watching us since it sat there for so long.  I didn’t believe in these objects until I actually saw one.  The object looked like a fat cigar with fluttering wings and had a light blue haze cloud surrounding it.  We were all a little creped out after that and laughed it off.;42.7351897142858;-84.476658857143
