Orange fireball traveling parallel to horizon suddenly vanishes;2012-06-26 22:00:00;25 secs;Orange fireball traveling parallel to horizon suddenly vanishes Sitting on my deck in the backyard when I looked up in the sky and saw an orange light, at first it wasn't very bright.  As I continued to watch it move through the sky in a northernly direction it became very bright and was orange in color.  I jokingly told my friend who was also on the deck that there was a ufo.  He moved over next to me a saw the bright orange object continue to move across the horizon through the sky and then vanish over the trees.  The orange object was moving fairly slowly and was quite large relative to other objects in the sky.  It left no trail.  It made no noise.  There was a slight undulation to the path of the object as it moved through the sky. Movement was parallel to the horizon.;45.1302;-87.6262
