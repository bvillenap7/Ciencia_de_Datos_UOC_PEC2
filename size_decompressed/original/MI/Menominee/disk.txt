Cloud piercing, invisible object.;2017-05-29 12:22:00;2 minutes;Cloud piercing, Invisable object. May 29th, 2017, I was on a job in Menominee, Michigan.  Supplies for my job had not arrived, so we ruturned to the motel for a day off. We were staying at the ((motel name deleted)) on the Bay which has a nice area overlooking Green Bay. I was sitting out there watching the boats and such and enjoying the nice weather and just in wonder at the beauty of the sights. It was a kind of cloudy day but not dark so I was watching the clouds and day dreaming a bit.  Wishing my Wife was with me to see the beauty and such. As I was looking at a large, solid cloud bank, it suddenly was pierced by a shape I instantly recognized!  Now I know it sounds weird but I swear it was the same shape as the Ships from 'The Invaders' TV show.  Or the Haunebu that was said to exist in WWII. I ran to get my camera and got a shot of the cloud penetration as it was desolving. Nothing came through the clouds!  It was if it was invisable but it left a very clean out line that I can still draw to this day. It did not form over time but just appeared in a blink!  One second a solid cloud bank the next second the shape.  No sounds, no vapor trails, no other odd sensations I could detect. Even the ducks swimming near by did not react in any way.;45.1302;-87.6262
