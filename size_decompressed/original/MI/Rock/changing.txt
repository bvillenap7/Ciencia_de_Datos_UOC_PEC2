Very bright, white ball exploding, reappearing and shape-shifting travelling slowly past Michigan;2013-12-24 17:45:00;20 minutes;Very bright, white ball exploding, reappearing and shape-shifting travelling slowly past Michigan We noticed a bright light out of our bay window, SW of our home around 5:45 pm.  At first we thought it may be a comet.  We looked at it through binoculars and it seemed like a ball of fire with a possible white smoke trail following it. I filmed it with my older Samsung camcorder, which has an 8mm cassette tape.  I have a 2 minute and 40 second recording which I don’t know how to copy, convert or forward to anybody.  It is a shaky video, but is a very clear image showing what seemed to be a ball of fire transforming, reshaping and at times, exploding into a very large entity, then imploding, only to shape-shift again. It was quite a distance away from us.  At times it looked round like a planet, until it exploded into multiple parts and shapes and got very large.  It was white in the center, with some noticeable green and was a pink or purple color around the edges.  It was not metallic, or dome shaped or triangle shaped.  It appeared to be organic in matter. We actually watched it for about 20 minutes.  At times it went behind clouds and was not visible to us.  It was traveling from the SE to the NW at a slower rate of speed.  It was not “streaking” across the sky.  (I researched some videos of the ISS, which seems to travel NE in an upward direction.  This traveled NW, going downward).;46.0501;-87.1273
