I noticed two white balls of light in a treeline to the east about two hundred yards away.  They were motionless at first about thirty feet above the ground. They then moved north about fifty feet very slowly.  They both dissappeared for about two seconds when one suddenly appeared about 100 feet away and about thirty feet high.  It moved to the west at about 10 miles per hour staying at about thirty feet.  It continued west, passing my position by about 50 feet.  It was white, about baseball sized and glowed an even white color.  There was no halo nor spikes of light around it.  I went behind a tree and was gone.  I felt unusually calm during the event, with no feelings of fear.  There was no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.5166;-84.6565
