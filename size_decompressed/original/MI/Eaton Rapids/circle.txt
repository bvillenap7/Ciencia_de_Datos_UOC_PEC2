Round, glowing circular object shoots down from the sky at a 45 degree angle;2003-02-16 21:00:00;seconds;Round, glowing circular object shoots down from the sky at a 45 degree angle At around 8:30pm my boyfriend and I were downstairs in the basement watching TV. All of a sudden, we both happened to glance up at the window behind the TV and we saw this glowing, circular object shoot down from the sky at about a 45 degree angle. We thought it might have been a shooting star but we don't believe there were supposed to be any meteor showers. Also, shooting stars are usually not as big as the object we saw and they usually die out after a few minutes (like a streak across the sky). This object was different. It was big, bright, and round, and as it shot down from above, it didn't fade in the least. It also looked like it was going to land, but we couldn't confirm that it had.;42.5166;-84.6565
