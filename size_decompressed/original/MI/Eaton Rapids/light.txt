Blinking red green blue and amber light;2015-01-26 03:30:00;Hour;Blinking red green blue and amber light I was driving home from work heading south from Lansing to eaton rapids. I looked over towards Orion's Belt and roughly 30 degrees to the left of the Orion constellation I seen a colorful light blinking blue, green, red and maybe amber. I see this same light frequently. From my front door facing west I seem the light about 40 degrees to my left.  I went inside to get my phone and Try to record it. I was inside for approximately 15 seconds.  I returned to my porch and it had moved to directly in front of me.  It was very far away so it had to have covered a great distance in that shot Period of time. Unfortunately, I didn't get to physically see it travel, although I am certain it was the same object I had just observed with my wife.  15 seconds prior to the movement.  I then watched it slowly travel a distance of roughly 10 degrees to my right in a period of 15 minutes before it blinked out.
