Red Fireball in Southeastern Michigan sky 11/22/2012.;2012-11-22 16:30:00;5-10 minutes;Red Fireball in Southeastern Michigan sky 11/22/2012 My husband and I were standing in the driveway of my mom's house (Thanksgiving Day 2012) and we noticed what appeared to be a red fireball coming our direction (heading north east).  It was much  lower than an airplane which caught our attention.   It moved swiftly but slow enough to get a good look at it.  My husband describes it acting like a jet engine as it looked like someone may have been &quotaccelerating&quot and the red colored fireball would intensify in color and then return to its original red fireball appearance.  It kept doing this (accelerating type of activity) without making any noise.   There was nothing else in the sky around it .. just this one fireball.   We watched it move northeast until it went out of our line of sight.   I kept checking the websites to see if anyone else in the downriver area had this same experience and have not seen any reports to date.;42.2523;-83.2107000000001
