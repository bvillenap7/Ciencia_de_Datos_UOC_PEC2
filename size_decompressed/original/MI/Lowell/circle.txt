Orange glowing balls above tree line.;2007-08-18 23:00:00;1 minute;Orange glowing balls above tree line. I was lying in bed looking out the window when I saw 3 circular orange glowing objects off behind the tree line.  At first I thought it was an airplane because we live fairly close to the Kent County Airport.  Then they disappeared.  Approximately 15 minutes later I saw at least 3 again Iâ€™m not sure if they were the same or different ones.  They were moving up and down above and below the tree line and then they disappeared.  Anyone else see these? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));42.9584;-85.3624
