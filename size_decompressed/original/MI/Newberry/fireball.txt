We were out of town just hanging out in the North country trail and Newberry was the closest place to us.  We all had a couple of beers but we all were sober enough to know what we saw.  Even our DD saw it.  It got super quiet, everything almost stopped, even time.  We all were very disoriented and felt a little sick.  Put of nowhere, we saw what we could only identify as a fireball like object.  It flew in a strange pattern, and didn't act like a fireball.  What felt like 4 minuted was actually hours, time didnâ€™t feel real.  A moment of silence took over us, trying to come up with plausible reasons of what this could be.  We came up with nothing, it was our DD who decided to look up different possibilities and the internet lead us to you.  It seems like the right path, we can only hope telling our story will help us learn and come to terms with what we saw.;46.3414;-85.5196
