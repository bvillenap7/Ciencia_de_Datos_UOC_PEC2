3 satilites moving in triangle formation from north west to south east.;2001-06-09 23:50:00;2min.;3 satilites moving in triangle formation from north west to south east. On 6-9-01 I saw several satilites and I'm entering this so maybe someone can say by the timeing that these were just more satilites. At 2345 I saw one sat.moving west to east,it was to the north of me.Then at 2350 I saw what I thought was 3 sat. moving in formation from the north west to the south east. I have seen sat. before but never in a group and never in that direction (I always thought sat. went straight east-west or north south Or vise versa)These objects were in a triangle with the leading edge having 2 and the 3rd behind the left side.(if you had a square and blacked out the bottom right corner thats what it looked like). They were moving steady like sat. but slower than any I've seen in the past and on this night.I watched them for probably 60 sec. before I desided to go inside and wake my wife up and have her come out and see what she saw. This probably took another 60 sec. to get her shoes and coat and her outside(I was afraid they would be gone).But they were still there I pointed them out and asked my wife what she saw(I had just told her that I wanted to show her something)and she verified what I had seen. She was able to watch them for probably 30-45 sec. before we lost site of them behind the trees. While we were still out side at 2400we saw 2 sat. moving north to south and south to north they passed each other very close to each other and almost over head. I know that these were probably just sat. but like I said I've never seen them like this. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the witness was observing satellites.  We believe, further, that the three satellites moving in formation may have been the ones that are part of the U. S. Navy N.O.S.S. satellite system.  They have been reported to us since July 1996.
