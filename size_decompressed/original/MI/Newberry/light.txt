A star-like light passing overhead in an arc, appearing in intervals over a time of about 60 to 120 seconds.;2003-08-07 21:00:00;about 2 minutes;A star-like light passing overhead in an arc, appearing in intervals over a time of about 60 to 120 seconds. On my back stargazing at Camp Paradise near Newberry.  A star-like light passes in an arc at zenith.  This lasts about two seconds.  The light reappears, following the same arc, for another second then goes out.  Seconds later I see it again, farther away but following approximately the same arc.  This finally disappeared and I did not see it again.  The first time it appeared, I thought it was just like a lightning bug passing overhead.  This would have been very unusual, however, because there were almost no other bugs whatsoever and I had certainly not seen any lightning bugs.  When it reappeared I was sure it was no bug because it was obviously distant, star-like and moving at a rate like a very distant object might move.  A satellite does not orbit in an arc,  an airplane would not have appeared in intervals and would not have taken nearly the same amount of time to travel the way this did - unless it was very, very far away and at such a high altitude.  I have seen so many airplanes, satellites and lightning bugs to know this was not any of this.  The intervals of appearance, the appearance of great altitude and distance and the time it took to travel the distances I observed it all indicate something I cannot explain.;46.3414;-85.5196
4 thousand foot long string of 11 red flashing lights stationary on Lake Superior north of Whitefish Point, Michigan.;2017-10-30 00:15:00;45 minutes;4 thousand foot long string of 11 red flashing lights stationary on Lake Superior north of Whitefish Point, Michigan. On the Lake Superior bluff looking east over the lake 17 miles west of Whitefish point, there is a very long string of 11 red lights at horizon level.  They are stationary flashing red two seconds then off two seconds. detached from the line further north is red light with a flashing white light.  This is positioned just north of the entrance to Whitefish bay.  The line is approximately the length of three or four 1000 ft cargo ships.  I have been up here for forty five years, seen numerous ships out on the lake, but just sitting there like this not moving for over 45 minutes  They are approximately 17 to twenty miles from my vantage.   Binoculars showed no outline of ships.;46.3414;-85.5196
