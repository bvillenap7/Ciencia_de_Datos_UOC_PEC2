When we loked up we saw a trinagular shape with white and red lights.  When it came down a little we saw the details of on the craft.  It had red and blue stripes along it and a odd shapped symbol at the end.  The event took about 5 minutes then it flew away;42.1807;-83.2523

About a half hour later, I saw it again.  It made a very faint low tone noise.  Although it was a very clear night, it was very dark.  With Binoculars I saw it had about 4 white lights up front and one in the back with one flashing, a large half sphere dome light on the bottom, and one constant red light on top.  It was not using anti-collision lights.  Although it was dark, I made out a dark triangular shape and it was moving so slow.   I saw the same thing last year about this time but I was by myself, so I'm glad I had someone with me this time.  WHAT IS IT?;42.1807;-83.2523
