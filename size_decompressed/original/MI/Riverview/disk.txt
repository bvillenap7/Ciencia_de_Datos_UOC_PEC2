My 2 friends and I were standing outside @ 1 AM this morning and we were over at my house.  We were swinging on my old swingset when all of the sudden, ((name deleted)) pointed into the sky.  There were ten bright orange colored saucers.  There weren't all that far from the ground.  Maybe 100-300 feet.  We stood in awe of them.  They moved fast, constantly switching places with another ship. When we went inside, it was still 1:00 AM. ((name deleted)), ((2nd name deleted)), and I ((name deleted)) are 3 13 year old girls.  We come from a rather normal upbringing, sorta (((name deleted)) mother died and my dad died as well.)
