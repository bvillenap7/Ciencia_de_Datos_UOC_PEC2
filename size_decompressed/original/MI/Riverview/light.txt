Very bright light 5-10 miles away from Riverview, MI moves unusually in night sky.;2010-04-11 21:05:00;aprox. 15 minutes;Very bright light 5-10 miles away from Riverview, MI, moves unusually in night sky. I was outside smoking my last cigarette before I turned in for the night, when I saw what appeared to be a very low star in the sky.   As I was watching this star object (which was glowing brighter then any star I could see in the clear night sky)  it appeared to float slightly up and down in the sky.  I continued to watch as it dimmed in color(bright orange). At this point I yelled at the top of my lungs for my wife to come and look at this object.  She came running with her digital camera in hand and as I pointed it out she took a single picture of it.   We were both standing there in awe as it seemed to bounce around the sky with no particular flight pattern, lighting up very brightly and dimming to almost no light what so ever(there were many lights on the craft). At this point we couldn't even speak to one another, I think it was just the shock factor of what we had witnessed.  We had watched for approximately 13-15 minutes. It was about 5-10 miles away from were I was located.  I initially thought that the photo we had taken didn't come out very well, then my wife used the 8x zoom feature on the camera and....well I was surprised to see a very clear picture of it.;42.1807;-83.2523
