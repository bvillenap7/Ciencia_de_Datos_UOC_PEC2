rectangular object that changed shape;2005-01-15 14:30:00;3-4 minutes;rectangular object that changed shape This was in the middle of the day- it was a rectangular object with a hazy ring around it  and it looked very far away so my impression was that it was very large.  It looked like it was moving down slowly toward the horizon, which may have been a trick of the eye because of the curvature of the Earth?  It was in SE MI close to the Detroit River, and it was in the eastern sky so it was over Canada. It looked almost like a comet, I actually thought it was a huge meteor and was waiting to see where it would land (I do admit my heart was pumping thinking of movies like Deep Impact, etc)  As it moved down toward the horizon, I watched it change from a long rectangular shape, to simply oblong, to circular, and finally I couldn't see it all. I noticed this while waiting for a train, so I had a several minutes to watch it. can a meteor or space debris stay in the sky for 3 minutes? (give or take a min.)  CAn a satellite be seen in the daytime or look that big? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  Meteors, which traditionally strike the atmosphere at a velocity of 50-75 km/second, are not visible for 3-4 minutes.  In fact, they only very rarely are visible for more than a few seconds.
