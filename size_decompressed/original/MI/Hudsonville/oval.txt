Looking at the northern sky at about a 30 degree angle up from the horizon we saw a object moving towards us. I studied the object trying to figure out what type of jet it was. (I was raised near a Marine Corps Air field in Yuma AZ.) As a young man I would watch the jets go on there training missions and could identify any jet there was, during the Military appreciation days I would go to the shows and the fighters would fly over at Mach 1 and Mach 2. The object approached at least at Mach 1. As it got closer I told the other man That ain't any jet. It was Oval flying just below cloud level, as it flew over head there wasn't any sound. I tried to get my 7 year old granddaughter to see it but she couldn't it was an dark oval with a slight aura around it, against a cloudy sky, you could not follow the sound forward to the object like you can a jet. It flew beyond us to about a 55 degree angle from the southern horizon and then turned slightly upward and flew into the clouds and out of sight.;42.8728000000001;-85.8773999999998
Orange lights over Hudsonville.;2013-05-26 22:45:00;5 minutes;Orange lights over Hudsonville While taking my nightly walk, I saw four oval orange lights in the sky, slowly flying south of where I live.  They were flying in a single line, with the same amount of space between them.  They glowed a steady soft orange, no other colors.   They went behind a tree line, and after I ran up the hill to see past the trees, they were gone.   After the event, I and the two other witness, who I met at the bottom of the hill, noticed a sudden influx of air traffic including a helicopter circling the area.
