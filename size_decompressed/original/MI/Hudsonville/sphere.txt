Blue-Green Sphere Moving in Circular Pattern Over Ottawa and Kent County, Michigan;2006-02-12 06:00:00;1 hour 15 minutes;Blue-Green Sphere Moving in Circular Pattern Over Ottawa and Kent County, Michigan At about 6:05 am on Feb 12 2006 I was traveling northbound on 48th Avenue in Ottawa County, Michigan. As I was driving I looked up in the sky and could see a greenish light moving in a circular pattern. It would make one revolution about every 2 seconds. So I continued to travel northbound and the light seemed to move with me as I moved. I pulled into the Georgetown Ice arena so that I could get a better look at it. It was not too high in altitude, probably about 50 feet in the air. While I was stopped it was making a perfect circle around the house across the street. After about 5 minutes of pondering what it could be I continued down the road, and it seemed to move with me. It never got any closer or farther away. I turned eastbound onto M-45 and it started to move eastbound with me also. Once I started to get into the city it got farther into the sky and higher into the air. After I arrived at the grocery store to pick up my girlfriend I looked up and could not see it, but I didn't think that it was gone, so I traveled northbound on Collindale rd in Standale, mi and once I got to a location where there were no city lights and it was still there. Looking on a map it appeared as if it was circling over the Sand creek golf course. The time now was about 6:50 am. I traveled back to the store and picked up my girlfriend, and went back to the location where I saw it on Collindale rd, and it was still in the sky, but very faint as the sun had started rising. We could see it faintly on the drive back home on M-45 in the North sky. We lost sight of it at about 7:17 am. the light could not be coming from a stationary object on the ground because it when I first sighted it, it appeared to be about 150 yards north of me, later in the morning it appeared to be miles away, but still north of me. The sky was kind of hazy/foggy.;42.8728000000001;-85.8773999999998
