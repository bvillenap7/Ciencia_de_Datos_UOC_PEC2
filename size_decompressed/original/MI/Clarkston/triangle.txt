Huge triangular craft in Metro Detroit area;2012-06-15 23:20:00;10 seconds;Huge triangular craft in Metro Detroit area As a amateur stargazer, I'm somewhat familiar with the nightsky.  I was actually looking around for passing satellites as they are visible in my area that time.  At first I saw three orange triangles moving across from east to west.  No sound or any movement variation between the three lights.  As I watched them fly above, the triangular lights were brighter toward their centers.  As the lights were overhead, you could see a structure holding them together.  It appeared to be transparent.  It was massive.  Several miles across. Like a cloak or something.  As I moved to to get a better view, everything disappeared.;42.7449523255814;-83.4145418604651
Triangular object with 2 small round objects in clouds in daylight,1 of the objects took off at increadable speed.;2013-10-12 18:30:00;30 minutes;Triangular object with 2 small round objects in clouds in daylight,1 of the objects took off at increadable speed. Round object moving slow, vertically up above clouds and back down below clouds. when viewed thru binoculars it was triangular with 2 smaller round objects just above the first.  All were bright white possibly reflecting the sun.  Viewed by 2 adults and 3 children.  After about 25 minutes, 1 of the objects shot straight up at an unbelievable amount of speed (blink and you would have missed it) and was gone. watched for roughly 5 more minutes when heavy clouds came past but objects were gone when clouds passed.
