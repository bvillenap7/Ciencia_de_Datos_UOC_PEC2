Brilliant orange/yellow fireball appears at concert also witnessed by two state police officers;2011-07-21 22:00:00;1 min.;Brilliant orange/yellow fireball appears at concert also witnessed by two state police officers While attending a concert at DTE Energy Theater tonight a brilliant Fireball appeared overhead.  I was just leaving the concert and told others who were leaving to look up.  I grabbed a picture on my cell phone.  It was a small round flame object almost directly overhead.  As I reached the exit gate it was moving away.  That's when I bumped into two State Police Officers who were also following the object. I ran out into the parking lot as it slowly faded out.  I am unsure of its direction because I was at an unfamiliar area to myself.  This was an very vivid object and was witnessed by myself and my friend I attended the concert with as well as the two officers and others.;42.7449523255814;-83.4145418604651
