Two instances of a formation of three lights moving rapidly across the sky;2021-04-02 22:00:00;3 seconds each;Two instances of a formation of three lights moving rapidly across the sky Time estimated, but between 9 and 11 PM.  Looking north, I observed a formation of three white lights (apparent magnitude of each light estimated around 1.0-1.5) arranged in a roughly equilateral triangle move rapidly northwestward across about 40° of sky in approximately two to three seconds, first visible to the NNE and disappearing in the NNW about a second before it would have gone behind the treeline from my location. As it was dark, I could not discern any form or silhouette between or around the lights, so I don’t know whether this was a solid object or not. About 10 minutes later, another formation of identical description moved parallel to, but slightly east of, the first formation’s apparent path. Both times, the three lights were solid in brightness and white, and neither made any noise. The weather was mostly clear, and there was some light smoke from a bonfire nearby. Only the first formation was observed through this smoke. I have been an amateur astronomer for about a decade, so I can confidently rule out satellites (based on rapid speed across the sky) and airplanes (based on solid lights and no sound). If not for it having more than a single point of light, and the fact it happened twice, this would have looked very similar to a meteor/shooting star.;42.7449523255814;-83.4145418604651
