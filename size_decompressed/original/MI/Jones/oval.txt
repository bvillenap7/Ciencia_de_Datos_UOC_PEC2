small Smooth moving orange glowing oval;2006-10-01 01:00:00;2-5 seconds;small Smooth moving orange glowing oval What I had seen as I was driving on m-60 east was a glowing orange oval coming from the left side of the road crossing to the right side of the road right above the tree line about a 1/6 mile away from a bar in jones (we were heading from indiana and were expecting a truck that just pulled to be a drunk, we did not go to the bar).  It appeared to me to be about 8 inches to a foot in length, moving in a smooth arch and just glowing orange.  I wasn't going to say anything but my friend yelled did you see that? WTF?.  Then I knew it was there.  According to him it had steam coming off it (it was cold last night) so we knew it was giving off heat.  He also said he could actually make out the shape.  I only had a couple second glimpse and it looked like an oval to me.  First thought in my head is what bird glows in the dark?  It was just really really odd.  This isn't the first time I've seen one of these but it is the first time I've had someone with me to back up my claim.  Also of note, there was no noise.  My window was partially down and the radio was off.;41.9155;-85.8381
