3 to 4 colors emanating in the sky darting back and forth and disappearing and reappearing for about an hour.;1998-07-15 23:30:00;about 1 hour;3 to 4 colors emanating in the sky darting back and forth and disappearing and reappearing for about an hour. We went outside and saw lights in the sky that were very unusual and quick moving- faster than an earthly craft- and darting from one part of the sky to the other.  There are some fields across the street from where we were.  The area is rural.  We saw a lot of them maybe 15 or so, some of them could have been the same one.  We saw about 4 or 5 of them at a time that were for sure separate crafts.  They had orange white and red lights on them and some green when we looked through binoculars.  Some would just disappear right out of the sky and then reappear on the opposite part of the sky.  They didnt get that close to the earth, they stayed up in the sky aways. They appeared to have 3 maybe 4 colors emanating from the craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));43.3904000000002;-86.3315000000002
Orange yellow spherical light streaked across the rural forrested highway and disappeared beyond the treeline.;2013-06-14 02:15:00;3 seconds;Orange yellow spherical light streaked across the rural forrested highway and disappeared beyond the treeline. After leaving Chicago after dinner on June 13, 2013, I was headed to Pentwater, MI.  At approximately 2:15 a.m., e.s.t., I was driving northbound on RT 31, a few miles North of Whitehall, MI.   There is treeline on both sides of the highway, and along the area dividing the highway directions.  The treeline starts approximately 25 yards off the street.  Streaking from left to right, heading away from the lake, was a spherical or ovular object that was bright yellowish/orange.   I only saw the object as it flew over the center treeline, and until it disappeared over the treeline to my right.  It crossed the highway approximately 50 yards ahead of me and was approximately 75 feet off of the ground.  It was 50% larger than a passenger van.   It moved extremely fast - treeline to treeline only took it 2 seconds or so.  It was totally silent, and there were no other cars on the highway in either direction.  Its movement was perfectly parallel to the ground.   After it cleared the treeline to my right, it seemed to arch slightly downward to cling to the treeline and disappear from my sight as I drove by.   I was alone in the car, but my dog seemed to suddenly look at attention after he had been sleeping most of the drive.   The fluidity of the object's movement was unlike any motorized object that I've ever seen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));43.3904000000002;-86.3315000000002
