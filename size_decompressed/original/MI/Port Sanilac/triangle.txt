Red lights in triangle shape in horizon.;2012-07-07 11:00:00;15-20 minutes;red lights in triangle shape in horizon. My dog wanted outside, put the dog outside, he wanted right back in, did not want to stay out.  I walked out and looked above my neighbors house and two sets of lights were horizontaly in horizon.  All of sudden one rose with lights in triangle shape, then moved up and away.  The second set of lights did the same thing.  The top light was very bright.  I called my sons out and they watched them also.  I regret not grabbing my camera.  There were a few small lights shooting across the sky away from the lights.  Those maybe satelites.;43.4361;-82.5499
Urgent sighting and possible encounter.;2017-07-05 03:00:00;3 hours;Urgent Sighting and Possible Encounter At about 3 am I went outside of my house to smoke.  I walked out the front door.  After I was standing there for a couple of minutes, a dark shadow in the sky caught my attention.  The craft approached from the east and stopped about 20 feet to 50 feet in front of me and was about 10 to 20 feet off of the ground.  It stopped and hovered over me for a period of time,  While the probe/ship was hovering over me I felt as though they were trying to probe into my mind.  I felt very cold and my body was shaking uncontrollably, and my left arm was also raised up at the elbow and my hand was waving.  There was some kind of light surrounding myself and the Alien, I can not remember how I left the alien ship.   When I came back to full memory the ship was about 200 feet in the air.  I went back inside my home and I laid down, then suddenly the door closed and the clock rang.  At what I believe to be 4 am I walked out of my home again to smoke and the triangular object was in the sky about 1000 feet in the air.    At about 530 am, I was outside my home again, smoking, when I saw a bright light hovering over Lake Huron.  It appeared to be about 5000 feet in the air and stayed in one position.  There was also an ominous glow and the birds and animals were all making strange and alarming callings sounds.  I believe that the aliens have done some kind of extermination on me.
