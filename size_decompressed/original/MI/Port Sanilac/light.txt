Second night sighting.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??  PD));2017-07-07 03:00:00;45 minutes;Second Night Sighting. I walked outside of my home at 3 am this morning, when I saw a bright light in the sky to the east, in the same location of the craft that I saw the night before.   I looked at it for a couple minutes and realized that the craft had red, yellow and white lights.   I went back inside of my home, and as I was trying to get inside the door, I felt the presence of a being trying to catch me.   I called the hotline and then went back outside to take this video.
