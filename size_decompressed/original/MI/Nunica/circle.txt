fast moving object size of star shoots fast east and then lights up and disappears.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible Iridium satellite.  PD));2008-09-02 01:25:00;6 seconds;fast moving object size of star shoots fast east and then lights up and disappears. I was walking out to my car to put the windows up ( i had school in the morning and i didn't want my windshield to be a fogged up). I looked up into the sky and saw what appeared to be a fast satellite or airplane going east. I followed it with my eyes for about 3 seconds as it shot east.  At this point the object lit up with lights for a good 2 seconds, and then disappeared. I sat outside for a good half an hour to see if this object would come back, but it never did.   I was extremely freaked out by this and tried to contact someone to report it. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible Iridium satellite.  PD));43.0845;-86.1017
