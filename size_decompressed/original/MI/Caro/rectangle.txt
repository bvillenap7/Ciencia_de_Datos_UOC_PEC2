It was shortly after dark when I viewed two lights (one in front and one in rear) moving directly toward my house.  I was able to only detect an outline of the craft as it was directly over head.  No noise except for when it was over head.  The sound was that of wind moving over an object in unison with it's position.  It appeared to be flying rather low though once it was overhead and I was able to hear the craft it must have been a few hundred feet or yards high.  It moved fast though not so fast that I was able to view it coming in and go over till it was no longer in sight.  It was almost as if it was a drone or video controled like craft.  The first thing that popped into my head was the drone craft utilized in Pakistan.  Anyway, I could not believe that it was happening to me and I was able to actually see this craft as best as I could considering that it only had two lights (front and back) and an outline of the craft along with it's low flying abilit! y with no real engine noise except for the sound of wind or sort of like a windmill rotating extremly fast though absent of motor noise.
