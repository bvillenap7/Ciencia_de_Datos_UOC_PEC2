White cigar-shaped object dissappears after being sighted.;2009-01-02 04:05:00;5 seconds;White cigar-shaped object dissappears after being sighted. The date of the questionable UFO sighting occurred on January the second, in the year 2009, around the time of 4:05.  This sighting of the object occurred over about five seconds, and was accompanied by the sound of a passenger airplane or jet aircraft.  Describing the UFO, it was merely a white cigar shape moving about the speed and altitude of a jet.  It had no visible wings or anything of the sort. What happened was that I was sitting in a room, and I looked out my window, which faced north.  I saw this object through the trees of my woods, and it went behind one of the trees.  As I was looking in the area, I did not see the object re-appear on the other side of the tree.  When I saw it, it was going from the North-Northeast to the Northeast. A similar experience happened about five years ago, but I was on the playground at my school, where I saw about the same thing.  I showed it to some people, and as I was about to show someone else, I could not find the object, although it could not have left the zenith in that amount of time that I turned back around.  It was going in about the same direction as the previous one too.;43.4855;-83.3846
