Odd light changing color, seemed to worry dog.;2006-04-26 22:50:00;about 10 minutes;Odd light changing color, seemed to worry dog. At first I thought it was an iridium satellite.  It went from west to east in the northern sky, it was a blue/white light.  Once it got to the almost due east part of the sky, it no longer kept the linear path.  It started going side to side, and I thought it must be a plane on a confused path.  When it was going east it was blue/white, when it was going west it was red/white.  When it was red, my dog would look up at it and whine, when it was blue again he would stop.  This went on for a while (I had no watch) then it turned east again after going back and forth, turned very red and disappeared.  It was quite odd.  I checked the iridium paths tonight and saw none for this area of the sky at this time.  While is was going east originally, when it was almost to the spot where it started back and forth, a jet was coming from the south east to the west north west.  The jet was accompanied by a jet sound as it came across, this light did not.  I had no optics to look closer at the light.  It could have been a plane and I would have thought nothing of it if it wasn't for my dog whining when it was going west in its oscillations.
