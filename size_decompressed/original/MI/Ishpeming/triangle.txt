Trianglular object with blue lights seen with binoculars and telescope;2005-04-03 22:29:00;>10 min;Trianglular object with blue lights seen with binoculars and telescope I first saw what I thoguht was a plane comming up from the treeline--almost exactly southwest, maybe 3 degrees more south.  It first caught my attention moving backward down too the treeline again.  I started looking, following it with my unaided eye it came back up to the same spot about 10 degrees over the treeline.   It then moved left to me, a southwardly direction, 10-15 degrees.  This was the point where I started wondering and got binoculars (16x32 power).  It was triangular with blue lights, my hands were not steady enough to tell then where the lights would be on the object.  It looked like a stealth bomber the best I could tell at this point.  By this time I really wanted to know what it was out there.  I had my telescope by the door because I had planned on using it tonight.  It is a 130mm reflector, with a 25mm eyepiece in when I grabbed it.  I got it out and on the object.  It was an isosceles triangle with blue lights on what would be the sides of the wings if it was a plane.   After I got the scope on it, I had to follow it back to the tree line.  The scope was set at 2 arch seconds at first, and that was not fast enough.  I had to change the speed of the scope, but I had lost it below the treeline before I changed the speed on the scopes mount.;46.4346999999999;-87.7093000000002
