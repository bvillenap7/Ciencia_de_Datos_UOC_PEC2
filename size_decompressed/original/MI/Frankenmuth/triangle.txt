Silent triangular object with 5 evenly-sized lights one at the nose/center and two on each side leading out.;2017-04-01 23:30:00;2 seconds;Silent triangular object with 5 evenly-sized lights one at the nose/center and two on each side leading out. I was walking with my girlfriend from the Bavarian Inn to Tiffany's in the downtown area.  My girlfriend said look at the sky, referring to the clear skies and the stars, when we saw the triangular shape fly about 1000 feet overhead and disappear.  It almost looked as though it vanished into the clouds, but there was no clouds.  There was no sound.  I wrote down my description of the object and then asked my girl to describe it.  She said the same thing: triangular object with five lights one in the center and two evenly distributed lights on each side leading to the tail.;43.3401;-83.7415
