4 lighted rectangular/oval objects...;2005-10-29 07:30:00;7 minutes;4 lighted rectangular/oval objects... I was at the back side of ((name of establishment deleted)) drinking a cup of coffe and just gazing at the morning sky, when I started watching what I first thought was a plane taking off (I do believe there are some small craft landing strips in this area).   This plane was soon joined by 3 others close by, and I realized that these lights I was watching were not any commercial or private aircraft.  The closer the first one got to me, I could see it was rectangular or long oval shaped with a very bright light from one end to the other.   As the craft got closer, the light imploded and the craft disappeared.  Then the second one did the exact same thing!  I ran back to the hotel to get my camera, and my keycard would not work to let me back into the building...I watched the last 2 craft do the same thing.   I am not sure of what I saw, only to say that I know they were not airplanes...it has got me pretty shook up!  Anothr weird point to make was that the keycard to the building would not work while trying to re-enter the building...but as soon as the last craft disappeared...it did.   Is this just a coincidence?;43.3401;-83.7415
