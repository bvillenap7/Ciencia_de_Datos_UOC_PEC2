Bright light shining with 4 lizard-like beings approaching.;1970-07-22 03:00:00;several hours?;((NUFORC Note:  We are uncertain whether this report is submitted as a serious-minded account of a genuine event.  However, we post it, nevertheless.  Date is approximate.  PD)) Bright light shining with 4 lizard-like beings approaching. Late at night in the mid-summer month of July I was awakened by a very intense bright light shining from the back side of the house that I grew up in.  I was accustumed to seeing bright head lights from the railroad trains as they approached my dads property from the town of Grand Blanc.  But, this time there was no deisel engines roaring and the light never faded as would when the trains passed by the property.   I could see this really bright light coming from the other side of the house and in order to really see it I had to go down stairs and look out the back porch door.  When I did this I was so blinded by this light that I had to cover my eyes and that is when I saw them.   A small group of four short, very stout, Dark-skinned, weird looking....almost a dark purple or navy blue color Lizard-like beings. It felt like a circus or carnival coming right at me,no! Coming for me! I freaked and went inside in a sort of strange dream-like panic and desperately needed to hide somewhere. I could not think and quickly just layed down on one of our families picnic benches that we used for feeding the large number of siblings that I grew up with. I tried to imagine that I was invisible and turned myself into a bench, for I was only 9 years old at the time. They came inside and as a group picked me up and carried me away. I was paralyzed by some kind of hand held instrument and it all just seemed like some sort of carnival-like dream. When I regained what I thought was my consciousness there I was laying on that bench still. It was just starting to turn a tad bit light outside and I went back upstairs and went back to sleep. Later that summer I started having night scares and an intense fear of sleeping in my own bedroom. I did everything I could to spend the rest of the summer at my nephews home we were close in age and I simply had no recollection of this experience, until I was a teenager and started having this exact re-occuring dream. For the longest time that is what I considered it to be, just! a reall y strange dream. Until I saw the movie,communion! The creatures were just like the ones they described visually in that flick! And then many years later my sister told me she saw them carry me out the door. We both have had to deal with this peculiar sense of being abducted and violated through some vague sense that we suffered through some ordeal. I believe that they zap you with this instrument to prevent  terror shock from killing us! Realizing this has in no way made my life any easier. It has been a burden on my psyche and self will. There are/were peculiar psycological and behavioral problems that I feel have stemmed from this occurence/disturbance in my childhood. I would sleep under my bed, seizures from out of no-where. Doctors probed my brain to see if I had epilepsy. An asthmatic condition would strike if I was suddenly spooked or surprised. To this day I still struggle with what happened. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  One of two dramatic sighting reports from the same source.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM UNIDENTIFIED PERSON)) Brother not joking of his encounter. He is a honest dear person, and knows no lies. The letter you recieved on 4-27-2007, of Lizard like creatures, was reported by my brother. He did have this happen to him and lives with it, daily.It is a very acurate account and is no joke.

An orange glowing light moving extremely fast in the sky.;2008-05-17 00:30:00;2-4 Minutes;An orange glowing light moving extremely fast in the sky. Driving home with my mother and grandmother, we noticed a plane land at a nearby airport.  About a minute later we saw an orange glowing light moving extremely fast in the sky coming from the opposite direction of the plane.  The color was kind of a dull orange, almost like a fireball.  After a minute or so of moving fast, it started to slow down and then it came to a complete stop.  A minute after that, it disappeared.  I rolled my window down and heard no noise whatsoever coming from the object.  It was a very dark and clear night.  This is probably one of the weirdest things I have ever seen.;42.9285;-83.6332000000002
Bright Orange Light over Grand Blanc, MI.;2009-01-14 23:15:00;2 Minutes;Bright Orange Light over Grand Blanc, MI. One ball shaped UFO seen in the clear night sky. It had one orange light that did not flash. The UFO was flying straight at about 1,500 feet. It was definitely flying faster than an airplane.;42.9285;-83.6332000000002
It was a flashing light going to fast to be a plane or sattilite.;2009-04-20 18:30:00;20 min;It was a flashing light going to fast to be a plane or sattilite. At a drive in. me and 2 friends saw a flashing light moveing at high speed directly heading to the right of us.  It was going to fast to be a sattilite or plane. But the color flashing did mush resemble a sattilite. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.9285;-83.6332000000002
3 bright lights holding a vertical position over central Michigan, USA.;2013-10-10 20:30:00;20 minutes;3 bright lights holding a vertical position over central Michigan, USA. Just after sunset, just above the NE horizon.  Both the Moon and Venus are bright in the sky, and I was aware of them both, so I did not confuse the additional lights with planets, satellites or stars.  There were 3 bright lights in a straight, vertical line.  They were not moving.  They were not flashing.  I kept a close eye on them during my drive home, they slowly dimmed and disappeared over the 20 mins that I was watching them.  I am certain they were not airplanes or helicopters.   There were no flashing lights, nor did they change position at all during the time I viewed them.  I am not ready to believe they were aliens, but they were certainly up in the sky, maintaining a constant altitude, and they all left within 1 minute of one another.  It was one of the strangest things I've ever seen. To finish up, I do not use a smartphone or else I would've taken photos and/or video.  My wife called me during my drive home to ask if I saw the lights.  She saw them as well, independently of myself.  I am submitting this in hopes that it can be cross-referenced with other sightings in the area.  There IS an airport in near-by Flint, MI, and I did see 2 airplanes flying in the vicinity.  I assumed they were just landing like normal.  Neither aircraft seemed to be related to the other lights in the sky, nor were they any sort of response to the lights in the sky. Thats it!  I know others had to have seen them, hope you get some good info.  - K;42.9285;-83.6332000000002
Star shaped light moving very fast, not airplane,jet or satellite or meteor in Grand Blanc, MI at 2300 6/2714.;2014-06-27 23:00:00;90 seconds;Star shaped light moving very fast, not airplane, jet or satellite or meteor in Grand Blanc, MI, at 2300 6/27/14. A very fast moving light across the sky moved over the area near Belsay and Perry Rds. at extreme speed and in the back drop jet with blinking lights was compared and speed was considerably slower than light.  Light wasn't a satellite, or meteor.   It moved in a diagonal path across a clear, star light night and finally disappeared in a cloud after about 90 seconds.   The object appeared as a star size light at first, but the speed and movement alerted us to something not celestially fixed.   It had no blinking lights as an aircraft or jet would have, it wasn't tacking along as a satellite does and speed was too fast, and it didn't leave a streak or a quickly burning and disappear as a meteor would do.   It crossed from the edge of the southern eastern sky to the northern eastern sky line before disappearing in a transparent cloud as the night was fairly clear and the stars seen fairly well as this part of the area has few light pollution interference from the ground.

Bright pulsing light caught on our HD surveillance system;2014-10-08 23:43:00;2-3 minutes;Bright pulsing light caught on our HD surveillance system The wife and I just laid down in bed and i had my eyes closed, but we were talking, when suddenly my wife said OMG, what is that light i opened my eyes and just just caught a glimpse of a light pulse from the monitor.  We have a high end HD surveillance system and a monitor next to our bed.  We both got up and were watching the monitor and talking about what just happened when about 4-5 minutes went by and a bright light pulsed again and lit up the screen.  My wife and i were freaked out by it since our house backs up to trees. I grabbed a flash light and went outside and i started shining my flash light on the video camera to see what it looked like versus what we saw. It wasnt even close!  The angles were different as well since i was on the ground and the light that flashed on our screen was from an angle higher than our house.  We played back the event about a dozen times and saw a bright light (round) in the top part of the screen.  What is even more intere! sting is that you can see the back yard light up just before it comes into the screen (both times).  It was also bright enough to look like a repeated flash on the screen (very bright)...it looked like it moved very fast but seemed to go in a circular motion (quickly)..at first i thought someone might have shined a flashlight on the video camera but i ruled that out by testing that theory...my flashlight is very bright and could not duplicate the intesity, pulsing, motion or brightness...weird :-);42.9285;-83.6332000000002

Bright orange lights in sky flying east to west.;2016-10-01 19:45:00;2:00;Bright orange lights in sky flying east to west. We were walking south when we saw a set of three orange lights travel east to west in the south skies high over the treetops.  After about 20-30 seconds, they seemed to fade away.    This happened twice more, one with a set of four lights and another with three lights.  They appeared to fly in a triangular formation, each time fading away as they reached appogee.;42.9285;-83.6332000000002
A light started flashing, almost as if someone was turning a gigantic flashlight on and off. ((anonymous report));2018-06-22 10:00:00;Seconds;When I opened our blinds facing the North Sky, I took a moment to look at the clouds as it was complete overcast and suddenly from the north sky a light started flashing, almost as if someone was turning a gigantic flashlight on and off.    This wasn't the first time I have seen activity and this… unnerved me.   I shut the blinds.  A few weeks earlier driving home from a park in Flint, both the driver and I saw a beam of light and took photos.  The photos are not too clear as they look faded from the sun’s brightness so we did try to adjust the contrast and it did show up better.  Unfortunately all we had was a cell phone.;42.9285;-83.6332000000002
