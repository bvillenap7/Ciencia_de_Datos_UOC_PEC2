Gold/yellow bow-tie shape with red orange center.;2014-08-07 00:01:00;minutes?;Gold/yellow bow-tie shape with red orange center. I live on a bluff above a creek.   I went out to let the puppy out by the pool.  Neighbors often put out fireworks during the summer, so I thought nothing of this for a split second.  Then I realized that there was no sound at all from what I saw.   It was very brilliant at first...in the shape of what I can only describe as a gold and yellow bow-tie with a orange center dot.  I tried to discount this as we live in the flight path of a local airport.   This thing moved in a fluid motion from from north northwest to straight above and rapidly ascended above and fell out of view.   I really did not want it to go away.  I told my husband about this and of course, he thinks I am retarded.  I have never said ANYTHING like this to him before. gold/yellow ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.9285;-83.6332000000002
