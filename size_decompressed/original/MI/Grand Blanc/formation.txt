Grand Blanc, Mi., two lights not blinking in a staggered formation, low altitude, and no sound.;2014-11-20 21:20:00;1 minute;Grand Blanc, Mi., two lights not blinking in a staggered formation, low altitude, and no sound. While outside on my deck facing east, I happen to notice two white lights, not blinking, in a staggered formation close to each other for about a minute, until my sight was blocked by roof lines at approx. 8:20 pm.  I couldn't tell if there was 2 objects or just one with two lights. It seems it was one object since the lights moved together perfectly.  The location was parallel to Fenton Rd. heading south, near Grand Blanc Rd in Mundy Twp., Grand Blanc.  At first, I thought it was an airplane, since there are many planes near by due to Bishop Airport about 10 miles away.  So, as I am watching this formation it was lower than usual than an airplane would fly in the area, also there wasn't any sound usually associated with an engine. The lights seemed to float.  When looking at the lights i noticed that at higher elevations, there was an airplane to the north and two more at higher elevation to the south with blinking red and white lights.   What i saw was completely different, it kind of stunned me, left me thinking, what did i just witness?  I'll be thinking of this for a long time.;42.9285;-83.6332000000002
