I have seen the same black/dark triangle shaped plane/ufo at a standstill at least 3 different times throughout the past 3-4 years.  Th;2000-12-01 17:00:00;3-4 minutes;I have seen the same black/dark triangle shaped plane/ufo at a standstill at least 3 different times throughout the past 3-4 years.  The first was in 1996 and the object was still above the treeline next to the US-23 expressway between Grand Blanc and Torrey Road exits.  I could see the lights on it which it had a red triangle underneath in the middle and a white light in front - it was a complete triangle not a stealth bomber which has like a triangle but v-shape to it. If it wasn't a UFO then is it a new military airplane???  Well since then I have seen two more farther off and they seemed to be at a standstill also.  They were also around the Genesee County area.  I haven't told anyone of the last two sightings but I know I'm not seeing things because the first one was so close and visible. The first sighting happened about 5:15am - 5:30am because I was on my way to work. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.9285;-83.6332000000002
I was driving south on Saginaw St. in Grand Blanc at about 8:30pm and I noticed a triangular thing hoovering just above the trees above;2003-10-21 20:30:00;2-3 minutes;I was driving south on Saginaw St. in Grand Blanc at about 8:30pm and I noticed a triangular thing hoovering just above the trees above Bella Vista Subdivision.  It had lights on all three corners, and some on the bottom.  My first thought was a ufo, but then I thought that would be a bit far fetched!  So, I stopped at Kroger on the corner and watched it for a couple of minutes.  It stayed in the same spot, not moving, while I watched.  It had no sound, which I thought was very strange.  All of the planes that fly low over our sub are VERY loud, and it wasn't shaped like any plane I have seen.  I pulled out of the parking lot to go home and when I turned to look at it again, it was gone.  I spoke with a relative who is in the military, and he said that there are no planes like that.  I have always thought that people who see these things are not quite all there, but I KNOW what I saw.  I am not a skittish person, but am a college educated, stable person. It bothers and perplexes me that I don't know for certain what exactly it is I saw that night.;42.9285;-83.6332000000002
delta shaped craft with odd colored and flashing lights;2009-03-19 23:05:00;1 min;delta shaped craft with odd colored and flashing lights I stepped outside to look at the stars. I spotted to the east 2 planes flashing red and white lights very high up heading west. I turned to the south and saw a delta shaped craft at a much lower altitude, heading northwest. It had 5 or 6 multi colored balls of  light, odd colors, not the typical red, green and white of regular aircraft. The tips of the triangle had yellow lights that flashed alternately back and forth. I didn’t hear it make any sounds. I tried to get my cell phone camera on, but couldn’t see it on my phone. I called my son to go outside and look up, it was heading in his direction, he saw it also. It flew in a straight line at normal speeds. It had to fly within a half mile of Bishop airport. Time observed about 1 min.;42.9285;-83.6332000000002
