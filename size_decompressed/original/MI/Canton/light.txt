3 bright lights traveling south, Canton MI.;2010-12-24 20:30:00;2 minutes;3 bright lights traveling south, Canton MI. At 8:30 pm on Christmas eve I was walking into my parents living room when a low bright light caught my attention outside of the sliding glass back door. I approached the sliding door suspiciously and witnessed 3 lights. These lights reminded me of candlelight. Together these objects moved synchronized in a triangle formation maybe 60 feet from each other and slowly. These lights were traveling south toward my parents’ home when I had seen them, maybe 1000 yards away. There was a lot of cloud cover. These objects were traveling silently below the clouds and perhaps only 150 yards in the air. My mother curiously went outside to closer examine what we were witnessing.  As these lights approached my location they abruptly stopped 50 yards from my home. As I was standing inside the home, pressing my face to the sliding door, looking straight up into the sky I could not see these objects and where they had stopped from that perspective.  I opened the door and stretched my body out and looked up to watch these objects rise into the clouds and leave.  They left one by one and I watched them rise into the clouds and could still see them until the light dimmed out completely... VERY WEIRD, I haven’t seen anything travel the way this did. I am a college student with 20/20 vision and I make every attempt to be objective. My mother is a house wife. This was a very chilling experience.;42.3115121951219;-83.4649048780485
Canton, MI - Large - Brilliant -  Orange/Amber Star-Like U.F.O.S - shrink and dim down / then disappear !!!;2011-09-11 21:30:00;4 minutes;Canton, MI - Large - Brilliant -  Orange/Amber Star-Like U.F.O.S - shrink and dim down / then disappear !!! Canton, MI / 9-11-2011 - First two U.F.O.s seen @ between 9:30 - 9:40 p.m. My 12 year old son and I were walking our dog around our neighborhood and when we almost reached the end of a court, I happened to look up into the south sky and noticed a very brilliant star-like light approaching( heading North ).  It looked slightly smaller than a golf ball from where we were standing.  I told my son to look at it.  We were both stunned and we both started saying Wow... what is that ?  Oh... my god ! etc.  I said, That is definitely a U.F.O.! and my son agreed, as we had never seen such a large orange/amber moving star-like object like this, in our lives !  It was coming toward us and I grabbed my son's arm and started backing up because it was very different, so I thought it could be dangerous.  We both just stared at it as it seemed to hover in one spot for a while, and then it began to arc ( take a curved path ) toward the East.  As we watched, it began to slowly shrink / dim out.  It looked as though it was getting smaller and less bright until it was just a dot without any light at all... and then it vanished.  We did not lose sight of it, it just disappeared !  Then my son yelled out that there was another one.  I looked around and seen the exact same thing, in the exact same area that we seen the first one.  Again...  It was slightly smaller than a golf ball, extremely bright... brilliant.  It looked like a huge orange/amber moving star, just like the first one did, and it also seemed to stop and hover, but this one moved slightly slower than the first one, but it did everything else the same. ( no blinking lights, did not blink, just brilliant ( flickering ? ) bright orange / amber light... like a huge star ).  It started to arc toward the East, and then started shrinking / dimming... until it looked like a dot in the sky, without any light... and then it! was gone.  Vanished !!!  Just like the first one did.  We waited to see if another one would appear, but did not see anything, so we ran home with our dog and told my husband what we had seen.  He asked us to show him where we had seen it ( all the while making fun of us ), so we ( my husband, son, dog and I )went back outside, and my husband noticed a star-like   ( slightly larger than a large star ) moving object, up in the sky, moving from West to East.  When he pointed it out to me, I told him it was the same color, but much, much smaller( farther away ).  My husband is a major skeptic ( engineer ), but he did take a picture with his cell phone camera ( yet to see the pic ).  He also did make the remark that the color was unusual, and he did not believe it was an airplane or a helicopter.  He also said he had never seen anything like it.  I told him that what he was seeing was sooooo much smaller( farther away ), that it was not as shocking as the first two that my son! and I had witnessed.  We ended up losing sight of this far a! way one , so my husband did not see it shrink / dim out and disappear, but at least he did see the orange / amber color of it.  We then took him to the exact spot that the first two appeared at.  We did not see them again. This was a very strange sighting that my son and I will never forget !!! If there is anyone else in the Canton, MI area that has also witnessed this /these U.F.O.s, please feel free to contact me.;42.3115121951219;-83.4649048780485
Line of Lights over Canton, MI;2012-09-15 20:15:00;5 minutes;Line of Lights over Canton, MI I was driving down Warren Road in Canton, Mi at about 8:15 p.m. with my friend when I saw about 8 to 10 lights in the sky.  The lights were East of my location at about a 15 degree angle of elevation in a slightly curved line and the middle was made up of lights that formed triangles with one UFO that was in front. The lights were white with a yellow tint. Before we pulled over, we saw an airplane banking and flying towards the UFOs.  The airplane had a red a blue light and was moving faster than a private or commercial plane. Five minutes later after we pulled over, they were moving West towards us and were then at a 45 degree angle of elevation.  While I was trying to get my phone out of my car to take a picture, my friend started to yell from the field, “Hurry up, they’re disappearing!”  By the time I got to where he was in the field, the lights had disappeared. My friend told me that the light in the front had started to rise vertically but slowly, but then increased speed and was gone in an instant. The other lights in the line then disappeared the instant the lead UFO had flew up, according to him.;42.3115121951219;-83.4649048780485

A group of red-orange lights following one another, travelling at a high speed and disappearing upwards into the atmosphere;2015-05-27 23:30:00;5 minutes;A group of red-orange lights following one another, travelling at a high speed and disappearing upwards into the atmosphere Reddish-orange light traveling at fast speed, heading East over Southwest Michigan.   The light appeared to disappear into the atmosphere.  Three more similar lights in formation appeared afterwards and seemed to be following behind the first light.  They disappeared into the atmosphere as well.  A fifth light appeared out of the Western sky and appeared to be the tail end of the group.  The light, however, stopped for 5 seconds, then shot up into the atmosphere.;42.3115121951219;-83.4649048780485
I felt as if my vision and perception was being altered with when they flew over. Everything became blurry and I had double vision.;2015-10-14 22:00:00;30 minutes;I felt as if my vision and perception was being altered with when they flew over.  Everything became blurry and I had double vision. Me and my dad were outside and starting seeing an object with a blinking red light on it that was moving extremely fast that it appeared to be skipping across the sky and then it was making a bunch of really sharp movements upward and down and left and right which airplanes obviously don't do, the craft would also abruptly stop in its path, and then continue on its course.  Then we saw another one, it was a blinking light that looked like a star and it was blinking all over the place really fast across the sky.  The objects eventually disappeared.;42.3115121951219;-83.4649048780485
UFO looked like Venus bright white light holding postion in dusk sky, as planes came in veiw UFO cloaked out.;2016-03-20 19:30:00;15 minutes;UFO looked like Venus bright white light holding postion in dusk sky, as planes came in veiw UFO cloaked out. March 20th 7:30 to 7:45 I was on my phone talking with my girlfriend driving due west down joy rd in Wayne county, Mi.  The sky was clear, pink and blue as the sun set. I made a comment to her on what I thought was Venus ((sic.  Jupiter)) making an appearance in the evening sky.  I thought it odd for it should be in the East.  The UFO was 45 degrees 55 degrees off the horizon due West and holding still. I made a mental note of 2 aircraft. The 1st a passenger jet flying due east at high elevation (Contrail) full visibility less than 100 miles out and closing fast with UFO off  its South/East at the 1st  planes 2 o’clock and at a lower ceiling.(UFO). Pilots had to see it. 2nd passenger jet was flying due North West at lower altitude full visibility of it in forefront climbing and closing in at 30 miles out.  UFO would be maybe 80 miles due North/West of 2nd plane at a slight elevation to 2nd plane 10’oclock.  Pilots had to see it. So as stated the UFO looked like VENUS bright and clear light.  But when it dimmed which at first I thought maybe a light skim of cloud pass through it, I noticed it “Twinkling”  the light it look as if it was rotating left to right. It grew bright again and then I thought Venus does “Not Twinkle” like a star.  All the time I was giving play by play to my girlfriend on the phone.  As both planes closed in on the UFO air space it just went dark, turnoff, disappeared, and vanished!!!!  Just was not there anymore!!! It did not fly off it just went it to Cloaking mode. My original Face Book post 20 March at 20:08  Okay I thought I would share this with you all about 20 minutes ago I was driving due West and noticed a bright shiny light that I thought was Venus in the Western sky it kind of faded out and then got bright again.  I thought it was the clouds fading out Venus in the Western sky but then the two planes that were flying in that direction got in view and the bright white light disappeared it wasn't Venus I saw in the Western sky and it sure wasn't a reflection of some plain headlight because it was way too big I thought it was the planet Venus, but I think I just saw a UFO it was a white bright orb and it disappear just like that !!!!!!!!!!!!;42.3115121951219;-83.4649048780485
