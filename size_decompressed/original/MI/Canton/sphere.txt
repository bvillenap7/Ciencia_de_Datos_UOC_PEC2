THE OBSERVANT SPHERE;2007-07-21 15:30:00;15 minutes;THE OBSERVANT SPHERE I AM A 27 YEAR OLD DRAFTSMAN I COME FROM A MILITARY BACKGROUND AND ONLY HEARD STORIES OF U.F.O'S. I WAS AT THE POOL AREA IN MY APARTMENT COMPLEX WITH MY FRIEND TAKING IN SOME SUN RAYS WATCHING PLANES FLY OVERHEAD FROM DETROIT METRO. AT AROUND 3:15 PM I NOTICED A FAINT REFLECTION OF THE SUN ABOUT 3,000-5,000 FEET ABOVE ME AND TO THE EAST HEADING WEST. I TOLD MY FRIEND AND POINTED SEVERAL TIMES AT THE OBJECT  UNTIL HE FINALLY SAW IT. IT MOVED REALLY SLOW AND WHEN I WAVED AT IT WHEN IT WAS RIGHT ABOVE US IT STAYED FIXED ABOVE US FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES, LIKE IT WAS OBSERVING US. IT APPEARED TO BE A SPHERE SHAPED METALLIC OBJECT, I THOUGHT IT COULD HAVE BEEN A BIRTHDAY BALLOON BUT WHEN IT STAYED OVER US FOR TEN MINUTES I KNEW IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING ELSE. AFTER TEN MINUTES IT STARTED TO SLOWLY MOVE SOUTH WEST THEN IT CHANGED VELOCITY AND MOVED SOUTH. I THEN LOST SITE OF IT AND WENT BACK TO SUN BATHING.;42.3115121951219;-83.4649048780485
Orange-Red Spherical object sighted over Plymouth/Northville, MI @ 23:00 EDT;2013-07-05 23:12:00;~10 minutes;Orange-Red Spherical object sighted over Plymouth/Northville, MI @ 23:00 EDT Was out on my back deck watching neighbors set off commercial grade fireworks, 22:45 Hrs EDT.  An orange-orange red spherical object appeared from nowhere, in the North Western sky.  I cannot say how far this was from me (see below), actually, or at what altitude with any assurance, but, it was a Half Dollar size by approximation to my eye.   ~22:50 Hrs. EDT  During the fireworks display, the object moved with instantaneous motions. (ie. moved from place to place in a blink of your eye.  Moving horizontally. Object seemed to be over Northern Plymouth / Northville, MI Townships during this observation. The object moved several times at instantaneous speed then remained stationary for the last aprox. 2 mins of observation then accelerated vertically, (very fast)-Eye blink speed and vanished. I took no pictures as I supposed, at a distance, they would just another meaningless  blurry image.;42.3115121951219;-83.4649048780485
