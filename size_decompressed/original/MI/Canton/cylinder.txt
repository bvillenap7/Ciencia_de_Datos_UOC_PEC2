It definitely wasn't a plane or Christmas lights.   I went to look and it was a flying cylinder shaped object.  It was dark, so I couldn't really see how it looked like.  It had lights that were blinking, like plane lights and it could not be a plane, even though I live near an airport.  If it was, I would have been able to hear a loud thundering noise flying over my house.  It was at least 2 yards high above the roof of a house.  It flew past 2 houses near mine and then swerved to front part of my house.  I went to see it from my foyer window.  It was small from a far distance.  It flew across the window view and headed for the woods clearing nearby.  After that, I couldn't see where it went. My cousin who was driving in the neighborhood on the way to my house and hour and a half earlier said that she saw it come from the neighborhood across the street and come to my neighborhood.  It went behind some houses then swerved towards the direction of her car and then turned back and flew somewhere else.  My guess is that it probably has something to do with the government like calculating census or there looking for someone.  I do not believe that it is a UFO from outer space.
