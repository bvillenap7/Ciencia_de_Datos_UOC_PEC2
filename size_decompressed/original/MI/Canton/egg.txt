This event took place August 5, in 2006, the time I remember well as I looked at my watch, which indicated at 4:55 am.  My house is on the fringe of the countryside, at the edge of Wayne county and bordering Washtenaw county.  I was alone when I witnessed this. Just as I opened my garage door, my attention was caught by a flash of light. It was brighter than most meteors I’ve observed before.  This object entered from the North at about 20-25 degrees above the horizon.  It had a plasma type trail wider, brighter than anything I’ve ever seen and it was traveling faster than any known object I’ve witnessed, such as meteors or conventional propulsion craft.  The air had a slight electrical discharge and a very faint crackling sound as it appeared out of nowhere in the sky as it headed from the North to the South covering about a third of the horizon in travel distance, over what would be from my direction looking North East toward I-275 and the area North East of that highway.  This would be in the areas of Livonia, Southfield on up toward Warren, Michigan. At first I thought it to be a meteor, however, I instantly looked to the end of the flash and noticed a shape appearing that of a craft about a mile up or more, possible disk shaped with a corona type discharge around the craft, making it look like it had some sort of field generation effect around the craft. From my vantage point it had stopped in midair, just pass the I-275/M14 interchange for about 1-2 seconds, then traversed back the way in came, but much slower like an aircraft.   It zig zagged  to the East direction, went straight up, zig zagged some more in the same direction and again went further straight up, taking what appeared to be an orbit like a satellite with the same speed as one, heading toward Lake St. Clair, Canada.  The entire event lasted about 15-20 seconds.;42.3115121951219;-83.4649048780485
