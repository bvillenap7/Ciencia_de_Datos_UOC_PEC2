UFO Encounter in Canton Michigan.;1994-03-09 21:00:00;2 min;UFO Encounter in Canton Michigan. Riding with my mother and my grandmother home the power was out in the entire neighborhood I saw a very bright like above our home.  My mother thought it might be a helicopter with a searchlight.  But it hovered way to still to be one.  As soon as we hit our driveway the light sped off threw the sky like a shooting star.  The neighborhood light's and power went back on.  When my mother hit the garage door opener to open the garage the garage went up realy slowly slower than normal.  We opened up the door to our home and all of our papers that we hold up on our refridgerator were on the floor along with the magnets that held all of them up.  The house had a smell of fish, and no one had been cooking fish that day or any day prior. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
