Twelve to eighteen white, wing shaped craft flying northwest through Canton, MI.;2008-11-22 14:00:00;15-45 seconds;Twelve to eighteen white, wing shaped craft flying northwest through Canton, MI. UFOâ€™s in Canton, MI  12-18 white objects resembling boomerang shaped seagulls flying in triangle formation was witness by my son and me.  It was the 2nd or 3rd weekend in November at the Family Video located in Canton, MI at the intersection of Canton Center and Hanford.  My son and I were waiting in the car while my wife ran into the store to return a movie.  The sun roof was open because it was a clear but brisk day.  I noticed what looked like seagulls flying very high in a Northwest direction. I noticed there was no movement from the wings, or circular pattern and they appeared to be traveling in threes.  Each group of three formed somewhat of a triangle.  It seemed to be 3-4 groups before I pointed out to my son to look up from the back seat.  He witnessed the last two or three groups. My reference points would be seagulls flying high in the sky and satellites flying across the sky at night. I would say that it was the height of the high flying seagulls at the satellite pace.  It was between 12pm and 4pm on either a Saturday or Sunday. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

Triangular shaped UFO with lights at corners hovering at cloud height over home;2009-10-01 09:00:00;1 hour;Triangular shaped UFO with lights at corners hovering at cloud height over home Saw bright lights above me while sitting on couch thru skylight. Got out binoculars and saw a gray, triangular object tilted at an angle with lights at corners. Object hovered and stayed in one place for about an hour. Checked on it periodically. It was quite high up, near clouds but could be clearly seen with binoculars. Did not appear to be a plane or anything else recognizeable. Could not determine size but must have been fairly large to see at that distance. Was not a reflection in my skilight. Too high for blimp or helicopter.

Tringular craft with bright white lights on the corners in S. Canton.;2011-09-08 20:30:00;5 min;Tringular craft with bright white lights on the corners in S. Canton. While delivering pizza in the rain near Denton and Geddies roads, I spotted a triangular craft flying low, slow and silent, heading west toward Willow Run Airport   The Triangle had bright white lights on the three corners and a reddish glow from the center of the bottom.  I could make out most of the outline against the clouds and it was not shaped like any aircraft I have seen.  I watched it as I drove into the neighborhood and as I pulled up to the house I was delivering to.  I went to grab my iPod to take a picture but when I turned around it was gone.  I brought it up to some open minded friends of mine and one of them stated that they have seen similar objects around the same area on different dates.;42.3115121951219;-83.4649048780485
Black triangle aircraft with white lights on each point, completely silent, seen flying low SW to NE.;2013-10-10 20:35:00;3 minutes;Black triangle aircraft with white lights on each point, completely silent, seen flying low SW to NE.   Another light on the right was turned on briefly, then off and then a light on the left was turned on briefly, then off. Less than an hour after that, a sound similar to a warning siren (the ones tested the first Saturday of every month at 1 PM) was heard for a moment, then a boom, followed by the siren sound again.   All three sounds lasted for about a total of 5 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.3115121951219;-83.4649048780485

Silent triangular shaped object with flashing white/yellow lights was spotted in hovering over neighborhood.;2016-03-18 06:00:00;1 minute;Silent triangular shaped object with flashing white/yellow lights was spotted in hovering over neighborhood. While I was getting reading for work in the morning (6:15ish), it was still very dark outside, I noticed an unordinary light pattern outside of my bedroom window.  I looked outside and noticed that the light was coming from a triangular shaped object that was hovering in the sky.  It appeared to be about 50 feet above the roof of a home about a block away.  It was still, not moving at all, for the first 30 seconds or so that I saw it, and then it started to slowly float across the sky.  The object was not making any sound at all but it did have bright white/yellow lights around the object.  I quickly woke up my husband so that he could see this thing, and he also thought it was strange.  We both saw the object slowly float through the sky and I followed it as much as I could before I could not see it anymore. I also noticed there was a regular airplane further up in the sky at the same time which seemed to be traveling normally across the sky.  We live by an airport so I am used to seeing normal planes fly around our home.  But this object was flying way closer to the ground than an ordinary plane would, it made no sound whatsoever, and it was just standing still for a while before moving slowly away-which is not typical airplane behavior. There were two vehicles that were driving down my street at the same time of the sighting and I am certain they had to see this object too-I was hoping to find a sighting report here to confirm that we are not crazy.  :) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
