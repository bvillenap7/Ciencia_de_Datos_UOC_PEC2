White circular shaped object appearing to intercept jet passenger plane;2013-07-07 19:00:00;2 minutes;White circular shaped object appearing to intercept jet passenger plane This sighting occurred in July of 2013.  I did not, at first want to report it, but felt that over time it may be helpful to someone interested.  I also reported in August of 2006 of two other sightings as well, one from my home and the other at work. This particular sighting happened around the first week of July.  The sky had intermittent cloud coverage, but for the most part was a beautifully clear sky.  I was sitting on my deck sky watching as I like to do, observing Jet traffic, birds or just anything, man made or not.   There is a lot of air traffic where I live and I am very familiar with aircraft, plus their flight characteristics, performance and so forth.   At around 7:00 pm, a passenger jet flew overhead at about 20,000 feet, heading East.  I watched the jet pass overhead for about 5 seconds and switched my attention to something else on the ground momentarily.  Then I decided to look up again at this jet.  As I did, I noticed a white circular object rising up heading directly underneath the jet, as though intercepting it.  I missed where this object was ascending from or flight path it was taking before this, it was just there is all I can say.   The object was circular from my view, rising and changed direction underneat! h the jet and passed through the contrails of the twin engine jet, missing the jet plane by what looked like a few hundred feet or so, then continued to climb at a fairly steady speed and went North.   I went to get my binoculars, which were just inside the house, upon my return, the round shaped object had just entered into some clouds and I lost sight of it. Its speed was about that of a fast climbing military jet, going to afterburner mode.   The size of the object was about half the size of the passenger jet when it reached the same altitude, judging by it passing through the exhaust stream of the jet.  The event lasted about 2 minutes.
