My family and I went in our backfield to observe the meteor  shower.  The sky was clear and no moon.  I observed an object, (white light,) that was traveling in an almost due south direction. The object then changed course moving to the southwest and then made a complete circle.   At this point, the object would move straight, suddenly reverse direction, move left and right, and make 90 degree course changes without slowing down and then come to a complete stop.  This repeated itself for approximately 25 minutes, and the object then appeared to get dim and then disappear all together. The object appeared to be very high in altitude and did not make any noise that we could hear.;43.7705;-85.5251
