Flying orbs in sky above northport.;2011-08-06 21:45:00;15;Flying orbs in sky above northport. This evening we were sitting near the bonfire and we saw three sets of glowing objects rise from behind some trees to the north (Cathead Point). Some were connected, apparently, because when one would turn the others would turn as well.   The second set of orbs moved independently, one moving toward another and then disappearing into the sky.
