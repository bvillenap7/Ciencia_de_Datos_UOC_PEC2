Bright craft viewed in northern sky, craft hovered for 10 minutes while being watched with binoculars. Craft backed away slowly.;2008-06-13 22:30:00;10 minutes;Bright craft viewed in northern sky, craft hovered for 10 minutes while being watched with binoculars. Craft backed away slowly. At around 10:30pm my wife and I were walking out to our barn to check on the animals. It was a clear night with lots of stars. We immediately saw a bright object in the northern sky. We watched the object for a little bit and my wife ran back to the house to get our binoculars. When she returned I looked at the object with the binoculars and clearly saw an oval shaped craft with 4 lights that were horizontal. The bright lights shadowed the craft so it was easy to see. The craft just hovered for about 10 minutes. Then the craft started backing away slowly and just disappeared.  My wife also saw the same because we were passing the binoculars back and forth. The is the second time that we saw something like this.;43.058;-83.1718
