Orange light and a blue light.;2011-10-08 22:30:00;1 hour;orange light and a blue light. My girlfriend and I was walking my dog at 10p.m. on 10/08/2011.  And decided to stop at lake were we live. I saw a blue light shoot across the sky so we went n sat at the picnic table by the water and then 5 mins after I saw the blue light there was a orange light really slowly moving across the sky id say about 200 feet high. There was also a airplane in the sky which was noticeably moving a lot faster with blinking red and white lights.  We watched the orange light for about 10 mins and the light just seemed to start faiding when all of the sudden it dimed right out and dissapeared but seemed to be traveling from east to west.    20 mins later we saw a blue light slowly go from what seemed to be going west to east and was about 200 feet and then just vanished like it dissapeared it faided out just like the orange light. I know for a fact these were not aircraft of our world;42.37;-84.247
