There was a bright yellow flickering light southwest above the treeline. It was many times brighter than Venus can be,and it waxed and waned in intensity over the course of 20 minutes.  There was also some faint reddish light.  It moved slowly toward the south covering approximately 45 degrees of the horizon.  A small plane flew nearby and the light of the plane was nothing similar to this light.  This light did not have a regular strobe like an aircraft and there was no sound.  At one point near the end, its intensity decreased to about that of the surrounding stars, then slowly increased back to its original intensity.  We finally lost sight as it went into the distance and trees obscured it.;42.9580266666667;-85.4788466666667
Bright light hovers then zooms away near Grand Rapids GRR Airport.;2015-11-02 19:00:00;10 seconds;Bright light hovers then zooms away near Grand Rapids GRR Airport. One bright light, intensity about 3 times brighter than brightest planet on most nights, appeared in the southern sky just as the stars were coming out.   Light did not move, but glowed bright white, intensified, then as it began to fade, or dim, it zoomed off in an upward and southeastern direction, fading to nothing as it got further on it's trajectory.  Similar to one I spotted winter 2014-15 in same area.;42.9580266666667;-85.4788466666667
