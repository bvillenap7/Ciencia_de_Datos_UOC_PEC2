An aircraft hovered over a car coming in our direction & then reversed, hovering over our car.;1977-07-14 23:00:00;30 seconds;An aircraft hovered over a car coming in our direction & then reversed, hovering over our car. I was with 2 friends driving home from Lincoln Lake at around 11:00 pm.  As we were coming into the town of Greenville we all noticed what appeared to be an airplane flying across the sky from our left to right.   The aircraft suddenly made a 90 turn in our direction.  We realized that it was following a car coming in our direction.  I immediately thought it was a police helicopter chasing a stolen car.   We all watched intently as we kept approaching the car.   We were travelling at about 60 mph as was the car coming in the other direction.  As the car passed us we all looked out the rear window to watch what was happening.  We couldn't see anything so as I turned back around (seated in the front passenger side)  there was a bright light coming thru my window.  I immediately realized this aircraft had fully reversed and was now hovering over our vehicle.   I knew not even a helicopter could make such an abrupt maneuver and thought immediately it could only be a ufo.  Being a risk taking 19 year old I decided to roll down my window and check it out.  I tried to see what it was but the light was so bright I couldn't actually see the craft.   The wind coming in my ears at 60 mph was loud but I couldn't hear an engine or helicopter propeller.  I kept yelling at my friend driving to pullover!!   We all jumped out of the car and looked directly above us but nothing was there.  Then, as we looked over a farmers' field we saw the light of the craft just zoom off and disappear into the horizon.  I have no way to calculate the speed it was going but it almost looked like a shooting star but not quite that fast.;43.1771999999999;-85.2472999999997
