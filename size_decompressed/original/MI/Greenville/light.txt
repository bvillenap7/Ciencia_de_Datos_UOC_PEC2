I was watching TV at my fathers cabin Near Hunter Lake and saw a blue light in the window, I then saw a red light and ran to the window to see them both come together into one light that was blinking many colors.  The colors were an awesome neon type of colors blinking many colors yellow red blue white green orange.  Nothing like I have ever seen before,  My father had a telescope by the window and  tried to scope it in and was having issues so I grabbed his binoculars and looked threw them instead.  I could see no shape at all just many blinking colors. I watched this until it was to small to see, about 15min.  It went side to side a few times but was moving away from me until It was gone.;43.1771999999999;-85.2472999999997
