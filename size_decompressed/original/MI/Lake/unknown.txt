It was a chilly night so I was closing a window before retiring for the night when I noticed an unusually bright star (so I thought) in the sky.  As I looked at it, it seemed to grow even brighter still, and then just as quickly it grew dimmer.  Soon it dimmed completely out.   I thought this was very odd as it was a perfectly clear night.  I decided to investigate it further so I went and found some 10x binoculars.   Upon examining the spot in the sky where the object had been I found nothing but stars, but looking a bit futher north I found something in my sights that took my breath away.  The object was comprised of 3 lights a larger blueish/green light in the center with two smaller reddish/brown lights on either side.  The larger light in the center was slightly elevated above the two smaller red lights, otherwise the 3 lights would have formed a horizontal line.   Immediately, my mind connected the 3 symetrical lights into some kind of or attached to some type of aircraft.  But, this craft was motionless.  I soon discovered a second object beside the first, then a third above that one, and fourth, all of identical size, color, and shape and all motionless and not blinking or pulsing.  As soon as I had counted the fourth object the lowest object began to move, slowly at first, but then accelerating rapidly straight up to the outside of the other 3 objects which remained still.   At this point I wanted someone else to see what I was seeing, so I went to get my parents.  Upon returning just seconds later all of the objects had vanished, we ran outside to search the rest of the sky and found nothing.;43.8561;-85.0249
