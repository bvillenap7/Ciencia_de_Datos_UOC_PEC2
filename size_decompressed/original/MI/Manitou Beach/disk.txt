I found it on Google Earth, while looking at a detailed zoom of Michigan.  The picture is obviously a satalite photo of Devil's Lake.  I then noticed a sphere/disk shaped bright light, making a strange patern under the water.  The scale of it compared to the docks and boats, makes me think it couldn't possibly be a boat. It's making perfect angles and the turn it appears to be making in the photo seems rather perfect. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
