I hope I can get this done with as little drama as possible. Sorry it's taken so long to report but the more reports I read maybe what my adult son and I saw might be more worthy than I originally thought. On August 20 at 7:pm dark with clear skies my son asked me to come outside. I'm disabled so with much ado I went out and looked up where he was pointing. I saw it and turned to go back inside but then it occurred that I've never seen anything like that before so I returned to get a second look. What we saw were two stationary orange discs side by side. My son has much better vision than I said that on the outside edge of each were small red flames all around. We live in the country next to a lake (if that matters) and there was no noise emitting from either of them. It was hard to explain the distance only to say that the size of each was fairly equal to the size of the moon but it seemed they were no more than 5 miles at the maximum away from us. My son said that he really didn't see them much longer than me but that they were in the same position than when I saw them. When I returned it was just then that we got to see them leave our area. They moved on very slowly spinning at first in unision with each other then very quickly sped up but it seemed to me they disappeared before actually flying out of sight though they were heading in a southwestern direction when they left. I've always been a disbeliever in UFO'S but this made me a believer!;41.9638;-84.2779
