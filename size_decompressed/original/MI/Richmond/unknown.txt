When i went exit a page it would a slurping-like noise, In general it was slower.after this i look out my window i see a object flashing white lights about 10 or 20 feet above the treetops (I think).  I didnt go and investigate as it was late and I didnt want to wake anyone.  It is now the morning i have been hearing planes outside.  If it was not a ufo it could have been flying out of Selfridge which is a nearby military base.;42.8389;-82.7996
