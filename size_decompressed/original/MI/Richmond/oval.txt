Steady moving oval object with an orange glow as if on fire.;2007-08-10 22:15:00;2 minutes;Steady moving oval object with an orange glow as if on fire. It is Friday night, August 10, 2007.  I am a 41-year-old male, married 14 years with an 11-year-old daughter. She was having a friend spend the night, and wanted to sleep in the yard in the tent. We started a small fire, set up the tent, and made smores. As night fell, we turned out the lights to see the stars. At approximately 10:20 p.m. we saw an oval object appear in the sky. It hade no definite shape, but was glowing orange on the top half.  My daughter, her friend and myself moved through the back yard to keep it in view around the trees. It was about 30 degrees above the horizon, and moved from our west to south. Its speed appeared to be slower than when we have watched planes. There were no lights (red, blue, green or white), only the orange glow. We all 3 remarked how it looked like something burning. I have witnessed shooting stars, comets, aircraft, hot air balloons, and even the occasional faint satellite, and this was none of those. The size was similar to that of a dime held at arms length. My immediate thoughts were that there had been some sort of disaster with the shuttle or space station. My daughter said maybe a plane on fire, but we figured a plane would not keep speed and altitude if it were burning (plus there were no other lights). I know that the confirmation of 2 11-year-old girls may not hold much weight, but we all saw something very different tonight.;42.8389;-82.7996
