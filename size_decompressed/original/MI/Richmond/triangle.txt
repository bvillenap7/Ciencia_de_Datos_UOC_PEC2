It went directly over top of me.  It was a very quiet morning and as it passed over me I could hear a faint sound reminded me of the Jetson's cartoon cars or something like the 6 million dollar man noise (nah nah nah nah nah nah...etc) but very faint and sort of tin-ish.  It came out of the south east over my head toward the north west.  I live about 10 miles north west of Selfridge AirForce Base and it came straight from that direction.;42.8389;-82.7996
