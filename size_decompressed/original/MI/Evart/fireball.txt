Green fireball  travelling south to north in mid Michigan.;2001-08-01 00:20:00;7 - 9  seconds;Green fireball  travelling south to north in mid Michigan. I was travelling home from Midland towards Luddington (East to West) at around 12:20am this morning and I saw what I thought to be a shooting star tracking from South to North. I cought it early on and Couldn't make my mind up what it was, I was almost suggesting to myself that it could be a satellite due to the way it wasn't getting brighter, when it did just that. Slowly it started to fizzle like a firework, then it grew in size getting brighter all the time and seemingly sparking, then I saw a puff of green and then it all turned a really bright burning green. I past a few trees but could still make it out it was so bright, then I came out on the other side (I was looking pretty nuch North now) and the fire stopped and just this red glow continued for a second, then it was gone. But I do suspect there is a hole in the ground a few miles north from here. The object didnt break up. Have you had any other reports of this nature in this area, and does this fit the Russian booster theory? I would really like to know if anyone found the whole. Regards;43.8886;-85.2628
