I was in the woods with a few friends, when we began to see a light that seemed to circle something.  We could not see what it was circling but it blocked the moon and clouds.  It was just rotating around and around.  We tried to get closer by driving but we never seemed to be able to get any closer.;43.8886;-85.2628
