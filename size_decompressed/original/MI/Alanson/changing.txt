Shape-shifting lights over Alanson, Michigan.;2015-12-04 18:00:00;5 minutes;Shape-shifting lights over Alanson, Michigan. headed home (mackinaw city) from visiting mom at mclaren hospital (petoskey),i spotted 2 bright lights which i thought was a plane with landing lights and looking south east and realized as i glanced up again to my surprise they were stationary and as i got closer going down the fairly steep hill coming to the light from chicago street at the intersection of 31&68 the 2  large round lights turned into 4, it was around 6pm and heavy traffic  as i turned right (south) on 31 and watching and driving i went 100 -200 yards turning right into the gas station to park and watch and make sense of these lights i pulled to close to the gas station canopy so i backed up and looked up only to witness them impossibly vanish in front of my eyes,i had no alchol and no i wasnt smoking anything and as much traffic as there was someone else had to see them,please dont tell me ive lost my mind and seeing things,what got me is 2 smaller bright white lights turned into 4 much bigger round lights and they were crossing one another at first 2 lights side by side turned into 4 lights in a straight line and changed formation to 2 side by side and behind them the other 2 they criss crossed and vanished and this all happened in 3-5 mins;45.4431;-84.7910000000001
