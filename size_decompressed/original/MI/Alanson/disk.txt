((HOAX??))I was walking by the sliding glass door of my house when something caught the corner of my eye out in the snow covered field.;2014-01-30 18:00:00;20 minutes;I was walking by the sliding glass door of my house when something caught the corner of my eye out in the snow covered field behind my house.  Normally I see various green bushes in the field, however this time one in particular caught my eye.   When I stopped to look directly at it it looked as if it was a normal bush.  However when I caught the correct angle it started to shine a brighter green and took a disk shape.  After looking at it quite sometime, I went to go invenstigate.  The moment I opened my door I heard a sound like that of clinking chains,followed by that of a wind-up eletrical whirring.  The bush disappeared, a saucer took shape and as I stared at it there was a brilliant green flash that blinded me for about 5 mins afterwards.   When I regained my vision the bush was gone, leaving no trace of having ever been there. ((NUFORC Note:  We have no way of knowing whether this is a serious report.
