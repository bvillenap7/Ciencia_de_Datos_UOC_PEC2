Daytime sighting of shape changing object.;2013-09-17 16:20:00;3 minutes;daytime sighting of shape changing object. I was driving down the road and happened to see an object flying very high.  At first I thought it was a airplane but, as I observed It, It didn't look like any airplane I ever saw!  It was like Two spheres stuck together.  As I watched It, It changed shape.  It started looking like a elongated triangle.  No contrail could be seen.  No sound either.  Weird!  Conditions were clear skies and no clouds.;43.0210300000002;-83.7155533333335
