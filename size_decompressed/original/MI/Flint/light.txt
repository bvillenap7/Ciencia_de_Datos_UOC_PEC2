a star seemed to move across the sky;2002-09-25 21:05:00;one minute;a star seemed to move across the sky approximately, nine p.m. on 9/25/02, i was star gazing, when i watched one of the stars, moving across the sky travelling in a north - east direction. the craft, or whatever it was, was the same brightness as an average star in the sky, and moved at an methodical leasurely pace. it was not a shooting star, or an air plane, i'm pretty sure, as there were no flashing lights, and its brightness, did not change: also it's altitude did not seem to change, as it travelled out of sight.again it seemed a star just started to move across the sky.

Red Object, fast moving craft that did not appear to follow the FAA rules.;2005-04-21 22:05:00;30 seconds;Red Object, fast moving craft that did not appear to follow the FAA rules. The craft appeared as a bright red light, with no blinking, approached us from the East and quietly moved overhead.  The entire duration lasted approximately 30 seconds.  The object was indead red as it past over. It past quickly over-head faster then jets seem to past. The sighting seemed strong enough for us to be sending you this information.;43.0210300000002;-83.7155533333335
Observed bright, rapidly flashing light, changing colors, direction and moving with unusual acceleration.;2008-05-14 00:13:00;90 seconds;Observed bright, rapidly flashing light, changing colors, direction and moving with unusual acceleration. I am a married, 44 year old college educated, business owner. I happened to wake up shortly after midnight and observed through a west-facing window, a very odd single bright rapidly-flashing white light in the distance above the trees.  At first the light appeared stationary, almost like a firework then it moved to the southeast.  The flashing was noticeably quick and in a pattern, not like a typical plane.   I woke up my husband who also saw the light through a south-facing window.  The color of the light changed from white to a brunt reddish color.   The light was moving at an unremarkable speed when it changed directions and accelerated upward to the northwest out of view.  The window was open but there was no sound associated with the activity. The acceleration of the light was uncharacteristic of any aircraft we have ever witnessed.;43.0210300000002;-83.7155533333335
Stange light, great speed, strange maneuvers;2008-05-14 00:15:00;20-30 sec.;Stange light, great speed, strange maneuvers I am a 35-year-old husband, father of two, business owner, not on drugs – legal or otherwise and an occasional drinker but had not consumed alcohol the day/night of this observation. On about the night of May 13, 2008 (about 12:15 on May 14) I was sleeping when my wife woke me to observe a strange phenomenon she observed shortly after midnight.  She said she had seen a strange, seemingly near stationary strobing light outside our west window of our second story bedroom window-probably about 15 degrees off the horizon. From the bed, I looked out the window but did not see the lights.  My wife got up and opened the blinds covering a south-facing window.  I then saw a very bright light – bronze in color.  It was flashing regularly and was very crisp and clear at the source. Our home is located in the flight pattern of an international airport and also a local community airport, so aircraft are regularly flying over our home.  I have lived in this area for over 10 years and have seen many planes both during the day and at night.  Nothing about the light I observed resembled an airplane.  I don’t know exactly how to describe the light but it was just so different than any light I had seen in the sky before.  The size made it look distant but without knowing the size, determining the distance was impossible.  What was unique about that light was that it was so crisp, and on a hazy night, one would expect an aircraft landing light to be fuzzy at a distance. I watched as the light traveled a little above the treeline defining the horizon heading approximately south.  The light alone was strange, but after watching it for a few seconds, it made a smooth but tight turn upwards and changed direction to the north or northwest.  After the turn, the light increased in speed suddenly, and then flew out of my view.  My wife ran to the other end of the house in time to catch another glimpse of the light before it disappeared completely from sight. It is hard to judge size, distance, and speed without known references, but the object was either very small, close, and slower  or large, distant, and extremely fast.  There was no sound, so a small/close object is not likely.but the light was so crisp that it didn’t appear to have been a known object at a distance.  if the object were distant, then the speed as it climbed up was incredible.;43.0210300000002;-83.7155533333335
Extremely bright golden/yellow globe-shaped object spotted traveling west to east at midnight in Genesee County, MI.;2009-07-05 00:02:00;1 minute and about 15 sec;Extremely bright golden/yellow globe-shaped object spotted traveling west to east at midnight in Genesee County, MI. Shortly after midnight, my friend and I were walking up a hill to his home on Kearsley Lake where we had been enjoying the fireworks on his pontoon boat when we both noticed a very bright golden/yellow light in the sky almost overhead.  We watched the light - which was similar in shape to a globe or rounded sphere - as it crossed the sky from west to east.  When we first noticed the light it was moving rather slowly, then as we stared at it, trying to ascertain what exactly it was we were seeing, it sped up and rapidly disappeared from view.   We are senior citizens, both of us are in our early 60's, and well educated (I am a retired administrative assistant and former community college instructor and my friend is a retired GM engineer).  Frankly I have always felt that only crackpots reported UFO's, and I am very uneasy about reporting what we saw however, it was not a plane, meteor, fireworks display, or anything else that would make some sort of sense.;43.0210300000002;-83.7155533333335

I was just one bright light. Brighter then all the street lights we could see.  We were driving and saw it flying over the tree line across a field.  Then it just disappeared.  It was very strange.;43.0210300000002;-83.7155533333335

I was at the intersection of Jennings and coldwater rd, when this huge light came out of no where as I was driving.  This light was the size of a late model Chevy suburban. I then wake my girlfriend so she could see it.  Her and I continued to watch and follow this object  all the way to Pierson rd. In this time about 5 to 10 minutes the giant bright light dimmed down and it was a giant oval shape. It then took of super fast tord the east then stopped on a dime went west stopped on a dime again and proceed to go east. this oval object just vanished into thin air.;43.0210300000002;-83.7155533333335
Strange light over Flint Mi.;2013-07-28 01:30:00;1 minute;Strange light over Flint Mi. Sunday July 28th at 1:30 am in the skies over Flint Michigan I saw a very bright light straight over head.  It was too big to be a satellite and it paused overhead and then started moving east. It disappeared after a few seconds of travel.  It was larger than a satellite or the ISS. I’ve seen both and this was not the same. I had seen a shooting star 5 min before seeing this object. I also saw a BRIGHT flash in the sky “Like Lightning “butt the sky was crystal clear.  It seemed very large and at a very high altitude. ???  It was an exciting experience.;43.0210300000002;-83.7155533333335
White/orange light hovers then drops out of sight from an extreme altitude by flint mi.;2013-12-24 21:00:00;5 minutes;white/orange light hovers then drops out of sight from an extreme altitude by flint mi. My wife and I seen a white/orange light very high in the air staying what appeared to be still for a few minutes.  Then it shot down at a very high speed!  It did not appear to fall because of the rapid speed and straight line in which it descended.  I feel it is important to say bishop airport is almost straight southwest of where I was and that from my living room chair I see and hear planes come and go almost everyday.  This thing stayed still and then fell at a very rapid speed from the east.;43.0210300000002;-83.7155533333335
Moving light making crazy turns.;2015-12-02 05:45:00;30 minutes;Moving light making crazy turns. At first I thought it was star, but then I noticed it moving.  It made turns and hovered.    Definitely not an airplane, and made maneuvers that helicopters do not do.;43.0210300000002;-83.7155533333335
3 lights like orion's belt stationary for a moment then flew away;2019-05-27 00:15:00;5 minutes;3 lights like orion's belt stationary for a moment then flew away i had a ufo sighting on May 27th 2019 at 12:15am in flint michigan:  On May 27th 2019 at 12:15am in Flint Michigan, as I took my dogs to the backyard of my home located on S. Vernon Ave., Flint, Michigan, 48503, I looked to the North and just below the Big Dipper, I noticed what appeared to be the three (3) stars from Orion's belt.  A moment later I realized that Orion would not be in that part of the night sky.  I continued staring and confused for about a minute or so.  All of a sudden the three (3) stars began to move to the East in formation and at a steady speed.  I continued to watch them until they flew out of sight (approx 5 mins). Unfortunately I left my phone in the house and did not get video of this incident. I was just wondering if there were any other reports on May 26/27th 2019 of these three (3) lights over Michigan, or am I the only person to notice?;43.0210300000002;-83.7155533333335
