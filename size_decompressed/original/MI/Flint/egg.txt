Flint Michigan November 2 2010 UFO sighting oval gray grey metallic sighting;2010-11-02 08:39:00;3 minutes;Flint Michigan November 2 2010 UFO sighting oval gray grey metallic sighting I was driving South to work on 4-75 from Clio Michigan, I was getting close to downtown Flint and saw a large grey object in the eye that immediately caught my eye. First of all it was an odd shape, almost like a balloon shape, dark gray and metallic. I knew at first sight it was not normal, at first I was adjusting eye sight to make sure it wasn't one of those balloons they float above dealerships, no, it's much bigger. Hot air baloon was my next thought, no basket underneath and at least 2 times as big as that would be. Then I notice it is moving, and gone..... Didn't creep me out but I couldn't stop staring and swerved lanes quite a few times.;43.0210300000002;-83.7155533333335
