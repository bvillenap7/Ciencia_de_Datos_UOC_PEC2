A metalic object flying at a high rate of speed;1982-06-12 13:00:00;3 minutes;A metalic object flying at a high rate of speed I was fishing on Mott lake and, it was early in the afternoon so I wasn't having much luck. I was looking at the clouds in the sky seeing if I could see any signs of a storm because I was in a boat, when I saw 3 sphere like shapes connected by 3 cylinders it was quite far away but, I could tell it was moving faster than any jet I have ever seen. It was about as high or higher than normal jets (commercial) fly from what I could tell. I was alone and, I had no camera but, I will never forget how the object looked, it was so strange looking.;43.0210300000002;-83.7155533333335

In the sky to the north of where I was sitting, a large orange spherical shaped object was travelling very slowly from east to west.  It did not appear to be burning or fiery, just a glowing orange color.   My family has a history in avionics (my father flew a B-17G in WWII and I flew cargo with him for years after the war) and, from my own personal experience, I would have to estimate the size at about 75-100 feet in diameter, about 1,000 feet up in the air and travelling at about 2-3 knots.   The object travelled about 75-100 yards at this speed then immediately ascended in a northerly direction at a highly accelerated rate.  It did not bank like you would expect from an aircraft,  it immediately switched directions.   I could not detect any sound coming from the object or its flight.   I watched it travel in this direction until it was out of my line of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness on three occasions, and we consider him to be an exceptional witness.  He has flown aircraft, since boyhood, and he reports that he has never in the past been witness to a UFO.  We suspect that his report is exceptionally accurate, and reliable.

Multiple orange lights making no sound heading east over Flint Mi.;2013-10-19 22:15:00;7 minutes;Multiple orange lights making no sound heading east over Flint Mi. At approximately 22:15 hr my wife and I was driving west bound on Richfield rd toward the intersection of Richfield rd and Genesee rd.   We noticed a orange light in the sky then looking a little farther into the horizon we see another orange light following the first light heading East.  I tell my wife to start recording them with her phone.   Then another orange light and another, the orange lights were showing up rapidly. We would focus on one and then notice two more we hadn't seen before.  I Do a U-Turn on Richfield rd in front of the Richfield Bowl bowling ally, 5340 Richfield Rd, Flint, MI 48506.  I am now travleing east and turn down Shamrock dr.   I knock on my brothers door and he and my nephew watch with us as the orange lights go past heading east.;43.0210300000002;-83.7155533333335
