Red blinking lights looking like radio towers move and then disappear behind tree tops.;2013-08-18 21:30:00;5 minutes;Red blinking lights looking like radio towers move and then disappear behind tree tops. Just got out of work and was riding with friends to go to their house in Burton.  We're going down Bristol Road, when I notice some red blinking lights north of the road.  I found it odd since there were towers on Bristol and Dort, but not on Bristol and Center.   I showed it to my friends in the car, and we stopped in the road to check them out.  They were chilling over the tree line.  If you were not from the area you wouldn't think it was odd.  However, as we were figuring out if they erected new towers in that area the lights started slowly moving east.   My friend pulled a U-turn and started speeding after the lights.  The lights started moving faster out of view due to the trees.  When we hit Bristol and Dort again there wasn't anything in the sky.   There is an airport east, however we thought that we would have been able to see the aircraft in the clearing.  Not sure what it was.
