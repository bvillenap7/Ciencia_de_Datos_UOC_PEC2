UFO over Flint, Michigan 1991;1991-06-01 23:30:00;<2 minutes;UFO over Flint, Michigan 1991 The time is pretty close, I think... but the date is just a guess. I shared an upstairs bedroom with my brother Sam. To better understand the stoty I have to describe the bedroom. It was the entire 2nd floor. About 12'x24' with windows at either end lengthwise, 2 in the main room and one at the end withthe stiarcase. My brother and I were staying up late one summer night watching tv, playing video games etc. in our room. I remember that a box fan was running in the lone window near the stairs to cool the room down, so that may account for the humming noise I remember but I'm pretty sure the ufo we saw was humming. Anyway we were up late and fianally going to bed. Our beds we on either side of the double windows. As I was falling asleep I noticed colored lights outside. I got up and looked outside the open windows and saw what I thought was a helicopter hovering about 10 feet above and between our house and the next door neighbors. I woke up my brother and told him to check out this cool helicopter because we were both really into anything that flew. As we watched this thing I realized right away that it was not a chopper because there was no rotor wind and it wasn't making noise except for the humming (could've been the fan). Then I started to get a feel for the size of this thing. It looked as though it was only 10-15 feet above the house but it covered an area at least 30' in diameter maybe more. I also noticed two rings of lights on the craft. The inner circle of lights were a very dim white or yellowish color, and the outer ring had different colors that seemed to shift in sequence. The lights were very dim all over the craft. We watched it for nearly a 1min. before I noticed Chris our neighbor, looking out his window at the ufo. Right then the craft took off. Slowly at first it turned about 180 degrees and then it was gone. I've told a few of my friends about this and have been laughed at. I figured that I was nuts. But two Christmas's ago, my brother brought it up after dinner. I! was in shock! But he remembers it the same. Has anyone else reported ufo's in the Flint area? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Object moved VERY slowly then accelerated incredibly fast from a stop, completely silent.;1994-08-20 21:00:00;2-3 minutes;Object moved VERY slowly then accelerated incredibly fast from a stop, completely silent. Was with my mother and sister.  In a car almost to our home, my mother stopped the car when she noticed some lights when looking out her driverside window (looking in a southern direction).  There were several lights of various color which looked as if the object was spinning very slowly, and one blinking light in the center on the top.  It could be seen not far above the tree line in the dark moving in a western direction VERY slowly with no change in elevation.  After debating if it was a helicopter or something we rolled down the window and there was complete silence.  If it had been a helicopter, it would have had to be within a 1/4 mile and would have obviously made considerable noise.  Soon it stopped and began to decend straight down even more slowly than it had been moving.  Suddenly it instantly accelerated almost too fast for our eyes to follow it increasing in elevation and heading in a south-eastern direction.  I thought I could still see it, quite some distance off now, but my mother was quite shaken by it and wanted to get my sister and I home.

ufo while driving on exspress way;2005-09-01 15:00:00;about 2 minutes or so;ufo while driving on exspress way While driving in our car on the exspress way, I looked up and what I saw was a silver, gray shinny disk shape object.  It was a sunny day with only a few clouds.  The disk seem to just float, and then it just disappered.   When I spotted it I told my husband that it looks just like an ufo. There was no cloud trail if it was a jet. There were no wings, and it was oval disk shape, moving very slow it seemed to float.  there is no doubt what I saw was an ufo.

Sept 20, 2007, two UM-Flint students observe 11 discs making formations in the early evening sky.;2007-09-20 17:30:00;15 Minutes;Sept 20, 2007, two UM-Flint students observe 11 discs making formations in the early evening sky. We two students were saying good-bye in the parking lot on University of Michigan - Flint campus. The early evening sky was an intense clear blue.  When I looked up, at first I thought I was observing Venus, as a steady bright looking planet appeared out of nowhere.  Soon there were several large bright looking stars slowly moving about in formation.  The first formation looked like a horoscope constellation and then they formed a square with three dots below.  I counted what appeared to be a total of eleven metallic gray crafts biding time playfully in the sky.  The bright light look just sort of changed to actual craft-disc appearance.  Two of the discs were actually doing flips like pancakes. One zipped toward the first main lighted disc(this disc never moved, the rest formed around it)  as though it were going to hit it, but quickly darted up at the last moment.  They appeared to be putting on a show for us.  We had the feeling they knew we were watching them.  We were frigtened and looked down to take the strain off our necks, when we looked up, they were all suddenly gathered right above our heads, all of them, way up and not moving.  We scattered to our cars and left.;43.0210300000002;-83.7155533333335

But I remember I was on the bus, looking at the sky, when I noticed a bright disk-shaped light in the sky that passed by.   It lasted for about 20 seconds, before it disappeared behind a cloud.
