I was driving home from vacation in New York City, and when we got home, there were dogs howling loudly and crickets chirping aggressively. I then saw a yellow-white flash in the sky, and it hovered for about 30 seconds. It made a loop-the-loop and then flew straight up, and then began to fly forward. The farther it got away, the brighter the light. It stayed in the sky for about 2 minutes and then disappeared. When it disappeared, the noise stopped. I was 100% sober (I like to smoke weed since it is legal in Michigan) and didn't know what the hell happened.;43.0210300000002;-83.7155533333335
