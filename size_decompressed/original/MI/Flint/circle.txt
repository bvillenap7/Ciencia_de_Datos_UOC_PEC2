Circular flying object with red white and blue sets of lights.;2009-06-30 22:11:00;30 seconds;Circular flying object with red white and blue sets of lights. We heard a noise louder than an airplane from behind, It was really dark and airplanes do not usually fly by the area especially that late. We were in a small subdivision. We looked up and saw three sets of lights one red one blue and one white in triangular shapes surrounded by smaller white lights in the shape of a circle. It appeared to be spinning at an angle and we could tell it was spinning because the lights were turning clockwise.
