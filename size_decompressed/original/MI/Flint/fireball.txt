Orange firey object floating in night sky!;2011-07-04 22:15:00;5 minutes;orange firey object floating in night sky! On july 4, 2011 approximatley 22:15, I was walk down the street and i seen an object in the sky i believe it to be a ufo. It looked like a big ball of fire, about half the size of a baby, small but large to see something like i did in this night sky.  The object moved towards me from a far  distantance, it made sort of a circular motion and they back and forth very fast, it had made like a high pitch screeching sound. I then grabed my phone to take a picture, the picture on my phone did not look like what i seen in the sky when i took the picture, thats what got to me,  it then stood there like something was watching me for about 3 mins, and then quickly went away it just vanished into the east sky. i then called authority to seek answers they told me i was crazy, i personally dont belive i am, and knowone belived me, and that scares me!  I as a U.S. citizen  personally did not belive in these type of things untill i came face to face i am petrified, worried , and i need answers, is it what i thik it was?   What did i see was it a ufo, it was fourth of july could it have been fire works?  I dont know, but it didnt look noramal to me!!;43.0210300000002;-83.7155533333335
I observed a large unidentifiable object with a long tail of fire traveling across the sky.;2012-05-24 21:15:00;~3 minutes;I observed a large unidentifiable object with a long tail of fire traveling across the sky. On May 24, 2013, at approximately 9:15 pm, I was on W. Hill Rd in Flint MI. I was facing a more or less Westerly direction and looked up.  Over my right shoulder, travelling from East to West was a flying object trailing a long tail of fire. As I watched, I removed my cell phone and recorded video footage of the event. The object proceeded in a Westerly direction until it vanished into a bank of clouds.  I kept recording, anticipating the object’s re-emergence from the cloud bank, but saw no further sign of the object.  It was much larger and more vivid in the sky than any aircraft I have previously encountered.  It burned very brightly and intensely, reminding me of nothing more than a launched rocket as it may appear shortly after lift-off, while still travelling through Earth’s atmosphere.  It was that appearance which caused me to make the reports and requests for information I made.  Being a Cold war Veteran, I could not help but equate what I saw with a possible missile launch. Being concerned for the safety of persons, I called Bishop International Airport, MI Air National Guard, MUFON, as well as local news agencies who I asked if they had received reports of this event-all replied that they had NOT received similar reports from other persons. Several suggested that I report the sighting to police, which I did NOT do. Whether Terrestrial or Extra terrestrial, there was no crime which I observed being committed or anything which I would perceive as falling under “Police Jurisdiction”. The Officer I spoke with from Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center spoke to his Base Commander, who had previously served at Wright Patterson AFB in Ohio, and the Commander stated that the USAF does not “officially recognize UFOs” and cannot, therefore, take reports concerning the sighting thereof.  He recommended I contact the National UFO Reporting Service and provided me with the number and website information to do so.  I am now doing so. Feel free to contact me if you have questions or information concerning this Atmospheric Event. I do have video footage which should be reviewed by an analyst.;43.0210300000002;-83.7155533333335
My daughter and I were on our way home from Genesee Valley Mall.  We were at a red light on the corner of Linden & Beecher Rd.  I looke;2012-06-14 21:30:00;5-10 SECONDS;My daughter and I were on our way home from Genesee Valley Mall.   We were at a red light on the corner of Linden & Beecher Rd.  I looked up in the sky and coming from the south eash and heading north west was a HUGE fireball looking things going through the sky.  It changed colors a couple time, but was mostly a aqua greenish blue color.  The sky was clear, except for the path of this fireball.  It seemed to be traveling behind the only clouds in the sky and shortly after it went out of sight, the clouds faded away as well.  The object kind of looked like a roman candle, but it wasn't going vertical, it was going horizontal and it was descending as it went across the sky.  No way was it a firework.  It was also about 2&quot in diameter as it went across the sky.  I mean it was LARGE.  No firework could have done this unless someone fired it from a helicopter over 10k feet and even then.... it would be so small like a spec.  This was huge!  My first time eve! r seeing anything like this.  It is something I will always remember it for as long as I live.;43.0210300000002;-83.7155533333335
Large, glowing object  (fireball?) invisible to naked eye;2012-09-23 14:00:00;1 minute;Large, glowing object  (fireball?) invisible to naked eye On 9/23/2012 the sky had been intermittently overcast with dark clouds/sun most of the day.  There was rain in the vicinity- although not exactly where I was.  I saw a beautiful rainbow to the SE of my location, and went in to get my camera.   I took pictures of the rainbow......and to the right of this rainbow you can clearly see the moon (although between clouds).    After downloading the picture on my computer, there was a large, glowing object to the LEFT of the rainbow, which was not seen with the naked eye.  It can not be a reflection- as it was 7:00 pm- and the sun was setting on the horizon behind my home in the WEST.  This photo was taken and the object was DUE EAST of my location.   What is it??   P.S.  I can not e-mail the picure- but it is posted on the MUFON website.;43.0210300000002;-83.7155533333335
