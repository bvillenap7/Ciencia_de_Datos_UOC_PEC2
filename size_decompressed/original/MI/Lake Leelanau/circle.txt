Twelve small reddish objects crossed in a left to right pattern over Lake Leelanau;2012-07-03 22:20:00;25 minutes;Twelve small reddish objects crossed in a left to right pattern over Lake Leelanau Witness Summary July 3, 2012 North Lake Leelanau 10:20PM Lake Leelanau, MI 49653    I was seated at the stern of our pleasure boat at approximately 2220 on the evening of July 3, 2012.  In a nearby town across the lake, fireworks were scheduled to begin in about 25 minutes.  The sky was partly cloudy and the full moon was beginning to rise.   There were many watercraft in the lake as well as many spectators watching from their homes or the beach.   My husband became excited and told me to look down the south end of the lake.   I observed a small, reddish orange light floating above the lake.  I would guess that it was about 1000 feet up in the sky, but I do struggle with measuring distances, as I did not have my glasses on at the time.   I watched as another followed the first.  I cocked my ear upwards attempting to hear a motor noise and heard absolutely nothing.   All in all, there were at least 12 of these small objects that I observed.;44.9901;-85.7291

Witness Summary July 3, 2012 North Lake Leelanau 2245  I am a 47-year-old Navy veteran and private pilot.   On 03 July 2012, at approximately 2245 hours, I was my boat preparing to watch the firework display on north Lake Leelanau.  I was at N45 01.210’, W085 44.060’.  I was approximately 250 feet from Porter’s landing at a depth of 48 feet.  The winds were calm, light and variable.   I observed an orangish-red glow moving from left to right from my position along the 45th parallel, travelling south to north.  The object appeared below the clouds that were present and it moved silently.  I estimate that it was approximately 5, 000 feet AGL.  Nevertheless, it was in between the ground and the clouds present.   The orangish-red orb was followed by 14 other objects that followed the exact same flight path as the previous one.   This all occurred just prior to the start of the firework show and I observed two of the objects go black and I could see their outline in the sky.  I could remember thinking that they looked like about the shape of a quarter.   I had no success obtaining accurate weather information from the FSS, NWS, NCDC and others.  I have seen many craft from both ships at sea, on vantages at land and from aircraft that I myself have piloted.  These looked like nothing that I have seen.  No strobes, nav lights or noise were present. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and we found him to be exceptionally capable, as an observer.  PD));44.9901;-85.7291
