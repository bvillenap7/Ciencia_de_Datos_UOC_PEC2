I was sitting in my car on a driveway on a farm, facing north and uphill toward a trail on a bluff, several hundred feet away.  It was very dark out there in the country.  I think there was no moon and the weather was clear to a little hazy.   Suddenly two lights that looked like headlights appeared at the top of the bluff where the trail was, bright with a fuzzy aura.  They continued to come toward me, about the same height off the ground as headlights, getting brighter but not necessarily clearer.   When they were about 50 feet away, they began to break up into many, many points of light, as if they were tiny stars shooting toward me.   Feeling suddenly frightened, I put my head down on the steering wheel as they soundlessly shot past me and all around me.  I picked my head up and checked behind me, but they were completely gone.   I checked the time on the car and about the right amount of time had passed on the clock.  I felt completely normal if a bit shaken, and got out of the car.   It is the only experience of this type that I have ever had, and I still can't find an explanation.;44.9901;-85.7291
