Red swiveling spotlight underneath low flying object;2011-08-25 21:00:00;1-2 minuted;Red swiveling spotlight underneath low flying object Was out walking my dog around 9 pm. Saw a glowing object coming from the north.  The first thing I noticed was how low it was flying and if it had been a plane I certainly would have heard it. As it got closer, I saw a red light scanning/swiveling back and forth.  Looked like a spotlight.   Ran inside to get my camera.  Didn't get a real good picture, but certainly looks like something I've never seen before. Definitely not a plane. Definitely a skeptic when it comes to UFO's. Not so much anymore.
