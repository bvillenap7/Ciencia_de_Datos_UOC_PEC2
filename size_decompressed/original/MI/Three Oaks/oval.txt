In our field of vision of the sky from our front porch, it took 60-75 seconds for this low flying,quite large orange object to cross the landscape. In seemed very low, moving unnaturally slow, and was completely quiet.   At first,we believed it was some kind of firework debris that was on fire and floating across the sky, but it couldn't be.  It looked a brightish, flame orange and was roughly circular, but it did not have clear, easily discernable edges.  It appeared almost illusory... Like seriously bad special effect.  All witnesses are in complete shock.   Not sure how this web site works, it was revealed in google search, but if any other witnesses saw this, I would be interested in discussing.;41.8186;-86.6179
