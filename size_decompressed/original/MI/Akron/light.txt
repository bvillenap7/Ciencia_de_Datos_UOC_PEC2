About 10:00 pm, my husband and I  came home and parked our car in the garage. I was ahead of my husband walking toward our house when I saw a small ball of bright  twinkling colored lights come from over our shed. It was bouncing back and forth. I called out to my husband to hurry, when he came out of the garage he saw it to. Then 3 more  balls of bright twinkling colored lights came from over our shed bouching around and hovering over our heads. They were  larger than the first.  It was as if they were looking down at us. They appeared to get about 8 ft from us.  After a few minutes they floated up to the sky, where we saw a large round saucer. It was also very bright and had many colored sparkling lights on it. The 4 balls of light entered the large ball. It hovered for about 5 minutes and then moved away toward the SE ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));43.5845;-83.5449
