First colorful light far in sky then 3 lights in a row, Saginaw County, MI;2010-08-11 20:00:00;10 minutes;First colorful light far in sky then 3 lights in a row, Saginaw County, MI First of all I want to start by saying I am not crazy, last night at about 8pm my boyfriend and I were going to his house in mid-michigan and were going down a somewhat country road to get there, the road had houses on it but we were the only car on the road. While on the road I saw a light in the sky that was far away that looked like a weird star or planet or something and after he saw it we started arguing about what it was, it wasn't moving but he said it was a plane and so I pulled over to prove it wasn't moving, it then started moving back and forth so we were both wrong and we saw a plane pass below it (it was definitely a plane). I started getting a bad feeling and said we should go so we continued driving down the road when (and this is the part where i swear i'm not crazy, we both saw exactly the same thing) three lights in a row came out of nowhere and started coming directly towards us. It was flying very low, too low to be a plane and almos! t in the tree line, at this point I was the most scared I have ever been in my life, it was not stopping and my boyfriend was telling me not to stop the car but I turned it around as fast as I could and started going as fast as I could the opposite way, I was telling him to call 911 and he got out my phone and had the number dialed but didn't call and when we got close to a more main road and started seeing other cars I started to feel better. I was near tears when we got to the main road and once we got there he tried to say it could have been another plane, so I insisted we go to the airport, once there he went in and talked to a sheriff and airport worker who said that the only flight that came in was from Chicago, this all happened before 8:30pm. We then concluded that there was no way it could have been a plane, (my boyfriend is very rational and level-headed) after the airport he told me that while we were driving, whatever had been in front of us was driving directly next to us less than a quarter mile away, he got a vague look at it and said it had no wings or tail. This was the most terrifying experience I have ever had and I almost can't believe it happened.;43.5161;-84.1822000000001
