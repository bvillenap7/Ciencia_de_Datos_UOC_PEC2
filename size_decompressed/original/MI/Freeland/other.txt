No sound & it hovered just 100-150 feet above us. Lights in a sequence on bottom. My friend and i were havine a bonfire. My dog started to go nuts barking and jumping up, she pulled her spade right out of the ground. (something a 25lb. dog can not do) We looked up to see an object that was NOT moving. Seemed to be just hovering in mid air like a harrier jet. It made no sound. It had red, blue & yellow lights on the bottom of it going round in a sequence like morris code. We just stood there unable to move. Suddenly the object SLOWLY moved forward and to it's left. When it got over the neighbors house it just disappeared. It was black in color and was about 100-150 ft above us. Ifelt as if i could touch it. It looked smooth like plastic and had no rivets. It had a long spear shaped nose on it and the back was flat. It had no tail wing. It reminded me of stelth w/o a tailwing. The nose was far longer than a stelth. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));43.5161;-84.1822000000001
