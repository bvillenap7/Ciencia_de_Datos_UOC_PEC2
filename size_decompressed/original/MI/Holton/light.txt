Unknown light makes 90 degree turn and disappears.;1985-10-01 05:30:00;3-4 minutes;Unknown light makes 90 degree turn and disappears. I was climbing up a ladder into my bow hunting stand , it was a crisp clear morning with many stars.  As I was climbing I looked up into the sky, not to specifically see anything but naturally as one climbs a ladder. I saw a bright light, not very large, passing from the north and moving to the south, the light appeared to be quite high. I thought it was an aircraft passing overhead.The light was steady, did not blink. I did not notice any sounds, nor any delayed sounds due to a jet airplane overhead. As the light was directly over me it appeared to come to a stop, stayed there briefly, say 2-3 seconds, then moved at an extremely high rate of speedoff at a 90 degree angle to the west. In comparison to most obervations of spacecraft in orbit, which I have observed, much faster say within 2-3 seconds it was gone from sight. The size of the light was about the same as most earth objects in orbit which I have seen over the years. I could not identify any details as it was much too high in the sky. However, the abrupt 90 degree turn after stopping was noted as unusual. This is the first time I have mentioned this to any organization.
