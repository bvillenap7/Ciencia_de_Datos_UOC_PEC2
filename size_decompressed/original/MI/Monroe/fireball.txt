Blue-ish fireballs in sky.;2007-06-15 10:30:00;7-8seconds;Blue-ish fireballs in sky. As I was sitting in my backyard, during a very clear night, I noticed in the corner of my eye a streaking flash,like a shooting star. As I looked up to see it over my head, it exploded in a blue flash. The flash looked like a fiery ball that then seperated into two blue-ish fireballs that appeared to chase each other in a tight circle in the very spot the explosion happened.The fireballs had long tails that form a circle when the chased each other. The fireballs continued to circle one another faster adn faster and closer and closer until they came together and exploded again in a larger blue-ish explosion. The fireballs then seperated, each going opposite directions, one appearing to burn out and the other compressing into a tiny star-like ball. The star-like object continued its path across the sky, looking much like a satellite, until it could no longer be seen. There were three other people with me, but they only saw what appeared to be the satellite crossing the sky. The entire episode concerning the firball-like objects lasted a mere 6-7 seconds.;41.9109830860532;-83.468272997033

Orange Fireball hovering close to Fermi Nuclear Power Plant;2011-10-31 21:15:00;1-2 Minutes;Orange Fireball hovering close to Fermi Nuclear Power Plant On October 31, 2011 (Halloween) at approximately 9:15 pm, I and my fiancé witnessed a UFO sighting.  It was a cool night and clear sky.  We had just gotten home from taking our 2 year old son trick or treating.  We began to clean up some of our Halloween decorations.  I had taken our trash cans out to the road for pickup when I noticed the odd object. I yelled for my fiancé to look.  He looked up and said oh my gosh I see it too.  We were so shocked and excited.  We were facing the Southeast when it was spotted.  The object was an Orange Glowing Ball that hovered over the trees and a house for approximately 1-2 minutes.  The object then began to move closer.  As it moved closer to us we could hear a faint humming sound.  The object was present for about 3 minutes total and then vanished into the sky. My fiancé’ grabbed his camera out of his pocket to try to take some pictures and video.  He was just taking videos and pictures minutes before.  The phone kept shutting off and on.  The screen was also flashing.  The phone is not even 2 weeks old yet and we have never had any other problems with it in the past.  The phone would not function properly until about 5 minutes after the object vanished.  We live right on Lake Erie in Monroe Michigan.  Fermi Nuclear Power Plant is also very close to my home.;41.9109830860532;-83.468272997033
