It was orange, and did not blink but stayed a constant orange, with an almost burning quality to it.    It did not shift direction but proceeded east until vanishing a few miles east of our position.    The duration of our experience lasted approx 90-120 secondsâ€¦;41.9109830860532;-83.468272997033
