3 orbs of light too slow for shooting stars.;2013-07-16 10:30:00;A few seconds;3 orbs of light too slow for shooting stars. My friend and I decided to take a walk out to the quarry behind the veterans memorial park located on Dixie highway in Monroe, Michigan.   We continued to change into our bathing suits and jump in the water.  Our night started with simple conversation when my friend noticed how well we could see the stars.   While gazing at the stars my friend noticed what looked like a shooting star, and then another that occurred right after which went in the same direction.   The first he described to be a bright orange color and the second to be a faint yellow color.   The last one we seen went a lot slower and was a yellow color.  It left a small trail behind it and disappeared into the night sky.;41.9109830860532;-83.468272997033
