V shaped object over St. Ignace,MI  on 7-2-03;2003-07-02 23:59:00;2min;V shaped object over St. Ignace,MI  on 7-2-03 We were in ST. Ignace,MI  camping and my sister and myself were coming back from the showers at midnight. I happened to look up over the camper and noticed a V shaped object with lights all along both edges of the object, the lights were round and luminous. There was no sound and it seemed to be decending on an angle the shape looked like a stelth plane. In a matter of  two min. it vanished. We both could not believe it and a woman near us said she wondered what that was as well. The next day our husbands talked to other people in the camp ground and told them what we saw and some other people reported seeing the same thing as well. This object was fairly large and the night was very clear and the stars were visible. We never saw it agian.;45.9985;-84.6978
