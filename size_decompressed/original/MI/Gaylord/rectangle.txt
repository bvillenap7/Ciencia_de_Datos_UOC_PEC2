WOW;2002-02-05 20:35:00;2minutes;WOW Drivingnorthbound on 1-75 1/4 mile from mile marker 283 at 8:35pm on tuesday feb. 5, 2002.  My mother and I witnessed a rectangular shaped object gliding southbound in between the north and southbound lanes, it was a greyish white color that seemed illuminated.  It looked small, 2-4 feet wide, it glided at a maintained level out of sight.  It looked to be around 40-50 feet up in the air.  It was gliding against the wind without losing altitude.  I have never seen anythin like it...  It was no plane, It was no weather balloon, It was nothing blowing in the wind...  It glided at a maintained height, against the wind...;45.0140638297872;-84.6713553191489
