Large craft over field--2 witnesses.;2015-08-23 21:00:00;10 minutes;Large craft over field-2 witnesses. It was just like any other Sunday evening in Northern Michigan...... A few of my  family members were coming home from town, they live approx. a mile from my house.  Upon passing my driveway (opposite my driveway in a farm field), my sister, and her 2 year old daughter saw a large craft with blinking lights hovering in a field about 50 ft above ground level.   When they reached their house they called and texted me to ask me if I was flying my drone, although my sister said she already knew the answer, as the craft was far too large to be mistaken for a drone.  My niece was rambling on for hours after seeing the UFO.   I don't know if I would believe anyone's account of this craft more than my sister, and niece.  They sent a video of my niece running and rambling around, whilst my sister and her husband asked if it was an airplane..... or a drone... to each my niece would say no... or kinda but different ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
