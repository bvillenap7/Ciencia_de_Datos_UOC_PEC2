Bright moving object in the night sky in Otsego County, Michigan;2008-08-23 11:00:00;45 min.;Bright moving object in the night sky in Otsego County, Michigan My boyfriend and I decided to drive to his parents house to look at the stars which is off of Charles Brink Rd. After about 15 minutes or so I spotted an extremely bright star close to the tree lines, and it appeared to be moving in an irregular way. Every once in a while it would brighten and dim, then flash red. We watched this “star” for about 45 minutes to an hour. Most of the time it would stay still, but about every couple of minutes it would move in different ways. Sometimes it would slowly move up in the sky. Sometimes it would slowly move down. At times it seemed to zig zag back and forth or move in a wave motion. And there were even times where it would make a small circle. After a while we just got sick of watching it and decided to drive home. There have been no other sightings since then.;45.0140638297872;-84.6713553191489
