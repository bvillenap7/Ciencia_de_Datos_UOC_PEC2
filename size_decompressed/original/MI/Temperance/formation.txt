My brother & his wife were leaving after Thanksgivivg dinner  He happen to notice very bright lights in sky.  His wife came in house telling everyone to go outside and look in the sky.  I grabbed my camera as I walked outside and sure enough there were very bright lights lighting up the sky.  There were 4 for sure in the front line and I believe two behind at each end.  As soon as we got outside the rear lights started to fade then the line started fading out one at a time.  We weren't sure if they were lost to cloud cover or fading out.  As soon as I walked outside and seen them I started recording.  I started to zoom right away towards one of them.  The 1st second of video you can see 4 lights in line all equal distances apart.  You can hear everyone on the audio questioning what they are seeing.  The lights were silent and headed east over Lake Erie.  We see planes headed to and from Detroit all the time, this was not even close.  These lights were huge in comparison, silent, and moved very slow.;41.7697;-83.5824
