Orange orb-type object spotted by an experienced firefighter/paramedic while on duty.;2014-10-06 20:10:00;15 seconds;Orange orb-type object spotted by an experienced firefighter/paramedic while on duty. I have been a firefighter/paramedic for 15 years.  While I was on duty this evening I was in the apparatus bay washing the ambulance when I heard a dog barking, which seemed out of place as I have never heard a dog in this particular area before.   At about that same time, the radio station I was listening to went from clearly audible music to static, the digital radios in the ambulance started to bonk no signal, and I felt an eerie presence.   I stepped around the front of the ambulance and out the overhead door where I saw a large, orange orb type object streaking from a south-southwest direction to the north-northeast at a very high rate of speed.  There were no sounds as the object passed and no visible landing or navigation type lights.  There were also no other aircraft visible in the area at the time.   As this area is very close to both Detroit Metropolitan Airport and Toledo Express, air traffic is very common place and the sounds of various aircraft extremely familiar.   As soon as the object was out of sight, the dog stopped barking, the digital ambulance radio returned to normal operation as did the music station I was listening to.;41.7697;-83.5824
