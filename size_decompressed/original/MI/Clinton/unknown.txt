2 White Lights appearing nightly in SE Michigan Sky - appear to change color & shape.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus and Jupiter?  PD));2015-07-12 22:00:00;Hours (nightly);2 White Lights appearing nightly in south east Michigan Sky - appear to change color & shape - do change location. From the town of Tecumseh, MI, one can look Northwest to the skies over neighboring town of Clinton, MI, and on a nightly basis just around dark (Occasionally earlier while still light) 2 bright white lights appear in the sky.  Both are similar to stars but much closer to the ground,  Both change shape, color and location multiple times during each sighting.   When observed thru Binoculars the light is too bright to make out anything particular, however appears to be a spherical object attached that waves in the wind like a piece of cloth.    I'm sure it's just a weather balloon or navigational beacon, but I can find anyone else who can confirm this.   There is Commercial aircraft, Cloud Seeding Aircraft and small recreational sky diving Aircraft in this area as well.  Any information would be appreciated.;42.0639;-83.9442
