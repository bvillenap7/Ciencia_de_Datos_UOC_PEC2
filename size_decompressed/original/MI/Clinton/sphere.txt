previously stationary bright blue object descends rapidly towards ground;2008-09-25 02:09:00;5 seconds;previously stationary bright blue object descends rapidly towards ground At approximately 2:09 AM Eastern Time on 9/25/08, I observed an object that appeared as a stationary, round bright white light. All of the sudden it turned a blue color and zoomed off, covering approximately an eighth of the southeastern sky.  It looked as though it was gliding towards the earth, rather than away.  Also it was visible in front of a cloud.   It all happened within the time frame of about 5 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
