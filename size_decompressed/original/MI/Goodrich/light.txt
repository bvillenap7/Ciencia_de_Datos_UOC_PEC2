As my son and I looked at the stars in the night sky, we noticed a BRIGHT orange, glowing light in the eastern sky.  As we were trying to figure out what it was, and if it was moving, suddenly, it sped off, at an incredible speed, into a north-east direction.  We watched it until it disappeared, which only took seconds.  Might I say, I have never believed in other life than ours on earth, however, now I believe there are others 'out there'.;42.915;-83.4861
