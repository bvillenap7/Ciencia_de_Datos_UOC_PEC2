Circular orbs making no sound, flying low and moving up in speed and altitude.;2014-07-05 00:00:00;1 hour;Circular orbs making no sound, flying low and moving up in speed and altitude. Red/Orange shaped orbs began flying northward, coming from the south.  Objects made no noise while flying over, gradually began to pick up speed and altitude.  I was outside smoking while i looked up to see the first orb flying about 500ft overhead when I looked farther south and saw another one coming to me, headed north.   I hurry inside to get my father to witness the event.  By the time we got back outside, 4 more of the strange circular orbs were nearing us.   The circular balls of light were picking up speed very fast and also gradually moved higher in altitude.;43.2701;-83.557
