Goggle Map-Street View: 24222 New York Dearborn MI- North West Sky Location;2008-08-02 11:15:00;20min;My niece was looking at her address on goggle map, street view and looked in the sky and said there was a flying saucer over her house-North West Location. Address is not hers , just a reference address Date,Time & Duration is today's info, photo is not dated. Goggle Map-Street View: 24222 New York Dearborn MI- North West Sky Location http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF-8&hl=en&tab=wl  There is a airport & fight path in the area, It is a sunny, bright day with a lot of glare & shinning in the photos that day. What makes it strange is: The shape of the object When you look from different streets (Notre Dame St-NW - different distance) (Boston St.-West & Smaller)) Still staying in the same general direction. Shape stays the same. When you search for it again a few more streets away (TIME) it is gone. I believe if it was was something on the liens, it would show up in different locations and directions  There is probably a simple cause of this effect, I do not know what to tell her and just in case there is not a simple answer, it could be worth looking into. Please keep me updated,  Thank You ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));42.3130608333333;-83.220935
