Series of low flying anomalous air craft;2019-11-17 18:00:00;1 hr;Series of low flying anomalous air craft I was driving down Telegraph road towards Ford road in Dearborn MI around 5:45 pm when I saw a very large strangely lit cigar shaped craft passing overhead rather quickly but silently and with ease. I wrote off what Iâ€™d seen as being a very high tech low flying blimp and redirected my thoughts. About five minutes later on the same car ride I saw a saucer shaped (much smaller) craft moving quickly overhead near McMillan and Heinz street in Dearborn Heights. (It appeared to be maybe half a mile from where I was viewing it). The lights, speed, and possibly shape were changing. It eventually stopped moving and hovered for a moment in place before lowering towards the ground at a ninety degree angle.  I pulled down the street to my destination, ran inside, and about twenty minutes later left again to go to the gas station. Upon leaving the gas station I saw the same very large cigar shaped craft I had initially witnessed now hovering above ford road near Golfview! . I took the car home and took the dog for a walk about ten minutes later to see if I could see anything else. In the same spot near McMillan and Heinz where I saw the small saucer shaped craft I now witnessed what appeared to be a white circular light appearing almost like a hole in the sky. It was very bright and emitting rays similar to a small moon moving overhead. Eventually the white orb appeared to change shape and now appeared as a horizontally moving craft with rgb lights blinking. In between these sightings was a steady and unusual stream of low flying identifiable air craft all headed in seemingly the same direction.;42.3130608333333;-83.220935
