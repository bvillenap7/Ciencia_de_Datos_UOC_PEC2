Slow, low flying triangle with no sound;1977-01-10 20:30:00;3 minutes;Slow, low flying triangle with no sound Traffic was very light on I-94 between Southfield and Telegraph.  I noticed cars approaching pulling off the road and was wondering why.  Then I happened to see it in the sky.  It moved very slowly, without sound.  It had to be at least as big as a football field and I pulled off to watch it about 1/4 mile ahead of me.  Once it had crossed the expressway I could see the back end and it was like a huge window all the way across. There were no running lights, but the triangular shape was well defined by the moonlit sky.  This was less than 5 miles from Detroit Metro Airport and had to be flying very low because the incoming planes to the airport disappeared behind big triangle.  All in all I think there was 8-10 cars that pulled off the road to watch it.  It was reported in the Detroit newspapers because my girlfriend showed me the article the following day and she was amazed because the description matched my sketch.;42.3130608333333;-83.220935

I wore my hair without braids to work that day.  Looking to my right I could see tiger stadium lights from a distance.   then felt a strange feeling in my hair,like a magnet was pulling my hair.I then felt my hair and looked up to my right up to the sky and seen a triangular fire-like object hovering beneath the clouds. it was beautiful, it was in a sapphire blue round like fog but the blue fog did not touch the ship. the fog was like a haze. I had goose bumps. Then I hit my friends leg and yelled look and they did and yelled what is that.The object then shot off north like the u.s.s. enterprise on startrek it left a shape of the ship after it streaked off and line after it left. It was like it was in two places at the same time. The ship was huge it made no noise. I yelled at two other drivers,the driver behind the car next to mine on my right nodded her head up and down and sped off. I could not catch her. I and my friend made a police report in dearborn.I also called airports,NASA,and FBI. They gave me a number to a scientist and he said he's studied ufo's since WW2 and said that's what we seen. That same night I seen it I believe I was visited mentally the night of the sighting as I slept, I had my eyes closed seen a dark figure but I could not move. When I did wake up the blinds were lowering. I was scared. I told fellow employees and supervisors and no one disagreed it was unbelievable the cloud around the ship pulsated.the ship was a reddish orange like a phoenix.;42.3130608333333;-83.220935
Object with red solid lights and blinking green flying and hovering overhead - faint 'whirring' sound;2014-11-05 20:50:00;:10;Object with red solid lights and blinking green flying and hovering overhead - faint 'whirring' sound I went out to walk my dog, and noticed strange lights in the sky - they appeared to be 3-4 solid red lights with green flashing lights on the side or forward of the red lights.  I stopped to observe, it looked like it was hovering around my neighborhood (I could hear a slight whirring sound.  It was a bit lower than a helicopter would fly and moved quite fast.  It started moving towards the west, hovered there, then came back east, above me, and continued.  I shined my flashlight towards it, but obviously it was too far above me to have any reach.  I could see airplanes traveling much higher (I am near a flight path). It is not possible that this was a persons drone.  The range it traveled was too far, and it was very dark outside. I am an Engineer.  I have asked others in my neighborhood if they saw anything, but so far haven't found anyone that also saw it.;42.3130608333333;-83.220935
