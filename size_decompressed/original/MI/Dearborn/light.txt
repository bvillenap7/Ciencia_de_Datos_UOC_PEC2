Silent orange objects flying in the night sky in Dearborn, Michigan.;2010-07-17 23:00:00;5 minutes;Silent orange objects flying in the night sky in Dearborn, Michigan. Myself and two others witnessed what looked like two balls of orange fire flying through the night sky while enjoying a fire in the back yard.  They were silent and as they moved flew in a zig zag pattern. One went north to south and the other went west to east.  They flew so fast and shot straight up into the sky and then just vanished.  This is not the first time that any of us have witnessed this and many times I have knocked on my neighbors door just so that I could have another witness. I do have pictures of these things and have witnessed them several times.  One of the witnesses used to serve in the millitary, the other witness used to be a sherrif and both have never seen anything like this before. Last year when this happened I had eight guests in my back yard for the fourth of july celebration.  I have seen up to eleven of these objects flying in formation and am very bothered that more people dont pay attention to the night sky.

At first I thought it was a aircraft but I did not have the blinking lights like all the commercial planes have I watched it for a couple of minutes.   I saw other commercial aircraft in the distance and this red orb was faster than the commercial planes.  It did not change its flight pattern.  To my observation it looked like it had a escort.;42.3130608333333;-83.220935

Observed what appeared to be a satellite moving north to south just below big dipper then noticed it changed heading to a die west course and decreased elevation to the point that it was approx 20 thousand feet.  Had a bright white strobing light that on every third flash was so bright was like it was taking a pic of ground and blinding.  Craft disappeared on a westerly heading behind roof of house inhibiting view and then reappeared approx five mins later and assumed exact same heading it took on approach as it exited all the way back to extreme elevation along bottom of Big Dipper south to north then dissapearing.;42.3130608333333;-83.220935
