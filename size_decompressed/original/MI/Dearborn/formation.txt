Three of them lined up with the exact same distances apart from eachother. The other round light was next to the lead light and again the same distance. It seemed to move slowly at first then spead up very smoothly until it was out of range for me to see it. I did not even realize how fast it went until it was moving and past an airplane which was only a few miles from the lights although the lights were higher than the plane. the lights were out of my sight in just a couple of seconds and the plane was in my sights for about a minute.;42.3130608333333;-83.220935
7 red/orange orb-like lights in a straight line moving upward before 4th of July fireworks, then faded and disappeared one at a time.;2013-07-04 22:30:00;15 minutes;7 red/orange orb-like lights in a straight line moving upward before 4th of July fireworks, then faded and disappeared one at a time. There were about 7 red/orange orb-like lights in a straight line moving upward from the sky right before the fireworks started for the 4th of July.  They were moving at an angle, and when they got higher they faded then disappeared.  Then we saw other fireworks in a different location farther away with the same lights in the formation of the big dipper.  We saw a third sighting again at another location of three red/orange lights in a triangle type shape, then they just hovered, moved upward then faded and disappeared.;42.3130608333333;-83.220935

Before the fireworks began we saw 7 red orange flickering balls of light lined up in formation across the sky.  They seemed to be hovering the each fading off in the distance the entirely disappearing.  Later while driving home were looking at fireworks in another location and saw the same red lights near the fireworks there were about five of them in the formation of the big dipper again each fading individually, eventually all disappearing.  As we got closer to home we viewed different fireworks and again we saw the red lights near the fireworks in a formation on a triangle again each time fading away leaving two then one visible eventually all disappearing.;42.3130608333333;-83.220935
