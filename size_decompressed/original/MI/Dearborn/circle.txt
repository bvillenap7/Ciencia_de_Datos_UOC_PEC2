Is this a commercial attempt at advertising?;2011-05-01 00:20:00;current;Is this a commercial attempt at advertising? I went on the back porch to smoke a cigarette.  I saw many lights rotating in a tight circular formation.  The circles kept getting wider and wider.  I contacted my son in his bedroom to look. At first he said it was a light.  To which I said there was not a significant degradation in light pattern as it spread wider. There was zero sound.;42.3130608333333;-83.220935
Jello mold shaped UFO.;2015-11-15 13:00:00;~2 hours;Jello mold shaped UFO. On November 15, 2015, at approximately 13:00 hours, I observed what appeared to be a point of fairly bright light in the southern sky.  This point of light was several degrees south of zenith, and slightly east.  Weather conditions at the time were clear, sunny, and fairly warm.  The light was similar in brightness to Saturn.  I observed the light with the naked eye for approximately three minutes.  The light did not move, flicker, dim, or increase in brightness.  I went indoors and obtained a pair of binoculars. Upon returning outside, I used my binoculars to look at the object.  It resolved in the field of view of my binoculars as a disc shaped object.  The object was not moving, nor were there any lights or other activity around the object.  It appeared to be chrome or light grey in color and at a fairly high altitude.  The material was very reflective.  I observed the object for about five minutes.  Unable to determine what the object was, I then went back indoors and brought out my Orion 4.5â€™ Equatorial Reflector Telescope with a 25mm optic. I found the object in my telescope and was able to notice greater detail about the object.  It was circular, and appeared to have thick, ribbed sides, similar to a Jello mold in appearance.  In the center of the object was a small nodule, also circular, that could best be described as the top of a bell.  There did not appear to be any tethering equipment attached to this object, nor any lights, windows, doors, or instrumentation attached, nor any motion from the object.  It remained stationary the entire time I observed it, which was about twenty-five minutes.  The object also appeared to be very stable and did not appear to be moving as a result of any winds that may be at the altitude the object was at. After resuming my outdoor activities, I came back to look for the object just before 15:00 hours.  The object was gone. I could not locate it anywhere else in the sky using my naked eye or my binoculars.  I searched online for anything similar and located an object with uncanny resemblance spotted in New Zealand in 2014.
