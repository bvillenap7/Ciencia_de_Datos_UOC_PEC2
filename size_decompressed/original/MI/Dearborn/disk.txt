Saucer with multi-colored lights near Fairlane Mall in Dearborn;1983-06-01 16:00:00;20 minutes;Saucer with multi-colored lights near Fairlane Mall in Dearborn I was in my car with my girl friend driving to Fairlane Mall in Dearborn Michigan. While on Hubbard nearing the mall we saw a saucer shaped craft hovering over a 3 bedroom home.  It was as wide as the house. The house was at least a 1000 sq. foot two story home.  The saucer could be explained as having 3 parts and silver or brushed aluminum in color. The lower base, the center which had circular multi-colored lights that rotated around the ship, and the upper dome. The lower dome had a lens (not sure if it was a light).  After stopping the car in the middle of the street we got out of it yelling. People came outside. Then the craft started to move (with not sound at all) and we followed it down towards Farilane Mall. It then went beyond our view covered by a tree line.  I went home after this event. Later that day my mother and sister came home after going to the same mall and told me what they saw. I mentioned to them I was in my car following it.  This was one of those times you ask yourself why did I not have a camera!
