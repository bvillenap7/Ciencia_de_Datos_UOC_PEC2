I was walking with my roommate into the Toys R Us on Michigan Avenue and we were watching a hawk - soon our eyes caught a silver glint high in the air and we lost interest in the hawk.  It was way far up there but it was clearly metallic. It was hovering and we heard no sound whatsoever. It wobbled a little and then shot straight UP at a very high velocity and was out of view in milliseconds. It was titanium coloured and cigar shaped hanging vertically in the air. We attempted to take a photograph (cellphone) but the clarity is terrible and you can't make anything out.  I have no idea what it could have been - I've never seen a man made craft move like that.;42.3130608333333;-83.220935
