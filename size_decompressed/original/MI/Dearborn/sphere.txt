Numerous spheres flying from east to west.;2017-09-01 10:20:00;20 minutes;Numerous spheres flying from east to west. My co-worker and I were taking a break outside of our work, and continuously saw 1-3 spheres at a time steadily flying directly west, well above the clouds.  They were all over the sky, but headed in the same direction, one group right behind the other and spread far apart.   At the same time this was happening, the sun had a faint halo around it.  When they stopped appearing, the halo was gone, and it started getting cloudy.   We are almost directly under the flight path of DTW, so you can obviously tell what was an airliner and what was a sphere.   The spheres did not leave any kind of trail, and would sometimes zig-zag their flight paths. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello again. I just spoke to someone at the NWS who stated a couple of things.  There was a high Cirrus overcast (I assume thats what was causing the halo around the sun), and lower sparse clouds moving in another direction.  I can’t tell you the exact altitude of the orbs/lights I saw, but they seemed to be a bit higher than the lower clouds.  Also, I don’t think I made it clear that the objects were not just in one spot in the sky like a flightpath or a line, but rather spread out in the entire sky, and as far as I could see.  They were just as visible from a distance, or directly above me.  If this was a weather phenomena, then what a sight!  Very cool indeed! Here are the specifics from NWS- This Cirrus Overcast at 25-35k ft. Wind direction - from SW-NE (240 degrees) @60kts Lower cloud altitude - 4-6.5k ft.  Wind Direction from East to West (coming from 060 degrees) @20 kts;42.3130608333333;-83.220935
