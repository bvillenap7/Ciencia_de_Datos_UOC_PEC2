2 Bright Orange Spheres;2012-09-11 23:00:00;5 minutes;2 Bright Orange Spheres Sighting Details: When I went outside at around 11 pm I noticed two bright orange balls flying in a vertical pattern. At first I didn't pay too much attention since we are so close to Detroit metro airport. After watching for a couple seconds I quickly realized that these orbs of light were definitely not planes from the airport.  At that point I decided to get my wife so she could see them. She immediately knew these were not planes. From the time I went in the house to get her (just a matter of seconds) the orbs changed their flight from following each other in a vertical pattern to horizontal.  They made no noise, and flew in a very distinct pattern. I don't know what they were, I do know they weren't like anything I have ever seen in the air. My mother-in-law also witnessed this and was as baffled as my wife and I. I was able to watch them fly for probably 4-5 minutes before they were out of sight. I am hoping someone on here may be able to substantiate my! story, or possibly shed some light on what we may have witnessed.;42.3130608333333;-83.220935
Silent orange fireball moves across sky.;2013-07-13 22:00:00;2 minutes;Silent orange fireball moves across sky. My, husband and I were sitting on our patio in our back yard at about 10 pm when an orange fireball began heading closer to us coming from the Southeast heading Northwest.  It was unusual because it is quiet. Makes no noise at all.  We watched as it changed directions and headed out of sight.  I attempted to look at it through binoculars but once I got the lens aimed the object through the lens appeared to be jumping all over the place.  This all took place within 2 minutes. This is the second time we have seen this, the other was about 3 weeks ago.;42.3130608333333;-83.220935
Bright slow moving orange (fire) balls moving at an angle up into the sky.  ((anonymous report));2017-07-04 23:25:00;3-4 minutes;Bright slow moving orange (fire) balls moving at an angle up into the sky. July 4th, I took my dogs out at about 11:25. There were a lot of fireworks being shot off, so I expected to see some things but this was different. While I was waiting for my dogs I noticed a bright orange light that looked like a fireball or a firework being shot off.  But it was moving very slowly up and over at the same time.   It slowly moved up and over my house until it disappeared into the clouds above my house.  I then noticed another light exactly like the first moving exactly in the same direction and at the same rate of speed.   The second one disappeared somewhere up above my house.   I thought it was very strange, so I came inside to google it, to figure out what it might be.  That's when I found the many other reports of the same type of sighting.
