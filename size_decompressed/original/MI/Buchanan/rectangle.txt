Spotted a UFO with lights floating above treetops!;2008-08-19 22:00:00;5 minutes;Spotted a UFO with lights floating above treetops! My boyfriend and I were driving on Miller Rd, when we saw something up in the sky to the left.  At first I thought it was a tower of some sort, but it was different than anything I have ever seen.  It looked like some type of rectangular craft that had two bright lights pointing in what seemed to be the front of the craft.  The beams of the lights seemed to go out for many many feet although I couldn’t be sure from the ground.  Their were two lights on the bottom that were the same, pointing to the ground.  The craft didn’t seem to be moving at all, and when we stopped at a stop sign, we saw that it was floating just above the treetops, and not moving.  When we turned and got a look at what I believe was the back, we saw five to ten lights as bright as the others, but with no beams.  We rolled the windows down and heard nothing.  A plane or helicopter would have made some type of noise, and this was like nothing we had ever seen before.  I am convinced what we saw was a UFO.;41.8361;-86.3737000000001
