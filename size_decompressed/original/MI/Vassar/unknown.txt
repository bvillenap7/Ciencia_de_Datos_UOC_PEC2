Three unlit aircraft escorted ( or followed ) by a helicopter.;2009-05-18 21:30:00;12 seconds;Three unlit aircraft escorted (or followed) by a helicopter. My name is ((name deleted)), I'm a 26yr old male. I'm currently studying psychology. I'm an excellent problem solver, very resourceful, and well trusted.  I have good eye sight and would never waste my time posting a joke of any sort on any website. I was just on my way to the video store at about 9:30pm, just as I got in my car I noticed 3 aircraft traveling slowly in a southbound direction about to cross M-15, about 1 mile northwest of the shell station in town.  The three aircraft were being followed closely by a helicopter. The helicopter had all the usual lighting that any aircraft would display.  However, the three aircraft in front had no visible lights.  They had slim profiles unlike the helicopter. They were following eachother in a close manner, single file. It was night but the sky still maintained a its blue color as the last of the suns light disappeared.  Visibility was excellent.  I am wondering what I saw. I have been able to produce no logical explanation for unlit aircraft escorted (or followed) in the night skys.  Any small planes would certainly have visiable lights, and for three of them to be togeather, unlit ???  Fighter jets are out of the question, I would have been able to hear them, and the chopper would not have been fast enought to follow.  I have worked around aircraft, hands on, and I'm baffled.  I tried to call the police shortly after to see if there were any other reports, but in this small town the police station is closed at night. I hope someone will stumble across this post and provide an explanation, and I will check back tomorrow to see if anyone else saw this.;43.3682;-83.5838
