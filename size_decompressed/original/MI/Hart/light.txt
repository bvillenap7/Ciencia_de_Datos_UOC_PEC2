VERY bright red-orangish light seen over silver lake---Lake Michigan Area;2008-10-16 20:00:00;15 minutes;VERY bright red-orangish light seen over silver lake---Lake Michigan Area The object was very bright..then it would dim a little bit..not by much, It would get very bright and turn an orangish-red color..it was kinda hazy looking because of the distance it was from us. It seemed to stay in position for quite some time,the direction of the craft was out by silver lake over the lake michigan area. There was one object seen where me, my bf, and my mom were at. It did not move fast, but after about 15 minutes it moved a couple inches over where trees were in view, but i could still see the object through the trees from the distance i was at, i know for a fact that it was a ufo.
