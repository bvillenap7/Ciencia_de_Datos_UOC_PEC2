Glowing round orange object that moved very fast and silently.;2011-08-27 23:00:00;approx. 10 min.;Glowing round orange object that moved very fast and silently. My husband went behind our barn to pee, and saw a round orange glowing light at about tree line height.  He thought it was a helicopter, but had no sound.  He came in the house to get me and by the time I reached the out door a object was a couple of miles up in the air.  All I was able to see was this orange light with a halo effect around it.  It stayed at that height for about a min. another one appeared from the west at about the same height.  A friend of ours took out his camera phone and by the time he was able to try to get a picture, it was too far away.  The lights went straight up in the air until you couldn't see it anymore.  It moved silently and very fast.  There was no drinking or drugs involved in the evening.  We had as a matter of fact just had a late dinner.  And my husband went out side to see his friend off.;43.4004;-84.8482
