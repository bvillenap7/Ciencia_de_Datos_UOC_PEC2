Bright light in sky.;2012-12-27 20:00:00;45 minutes;Bright light in sky 12/28/2012 Riverdale, MI Last night, at 8:00 pm, I was coming home from work, traveling south on a county road.   I noticed in the sky about 300 feet above tree level a bright white light.  After about a mile I concluded it must be a spotlight from a helicopter.  The light remained fixed, slightly to the east of the road.   As I approached my home I turned into the drive and the light remained fixed in the sky above and behind my garage.  As my headlights illuminated the garage the light dropped rapidly behind the garage.   I parked my car and walked to the back of the yard to investigate.  The tree line, approximately 600 feet in back of a tilled field, was backlight with a bright light.  I went into the house retrieved a flashlight and camera.  I then proceeded down a lane on the south property line. The backlight was no longer bright but more of an amber color.  Because it was a full moon and the ground was snow covered I kept the flashlight off as I approached.   I was within 100 feet of the tree lin! e when the amber light went suddenly out.  At this point I lost my nerve and returned to the house, locked the door and closed the curtains.    This morning I walked to the back of our property to complete my investigation.  There was nothing to indicate anything unusual happen the night before.;43.4004;-84.8482
