It moved across the sky at same height to the south.   It all the sudden rose in the sky about a couple of miles and stayed there.   Another object of the same kind appeared from the west and both took off at the same time to the stars till you could no longer see them. We tried to get pictures but the object moved so fast it wasn't possible.  We just happened to be out side seeing our visitor off.  It was hard not to notice an orange glowing object in the sky. I was not a believer of such things but now I am. It was the strangest thing I have ever seen.
