I saw a U.F.O. while flying a kite at 8 yrs. old;2003-09-26 03:07:00;0:08;I saw a U.F.O. while flying a kite at 8 yrs. old My dad and I were out flying a kite,and from the the corner of my eye,I saw a glowing lght.It had one wing at 4:00 and one wing at about 10:00, so it was definately on an angle. It started out as a reddish color, then an orange, then to sort of an opaque. It was kind of hard to see because it was kind of cloudy.I ran inside to get the phone to call someone, but before I had even left, it turned a bright yellow and disappeared. The closest airport(or military base for that matter) is Detroit, and they do not fly anywhere near Pleasant Lake.
