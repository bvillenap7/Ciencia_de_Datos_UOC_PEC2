Very large, cigar shaped with round portholes on Lake Michigan's bluff.;1980-07-20 01:00:00;30  ??;Very large, cigar shaped with round portholes on Lake Michigan's bluff. I was driving home around 1 AM when I saw a huge, cigar shaped object with approximately 8 lit portholes around the mid-section.  I pulled to the side of the road and watched it for about 30 minutes, there was no other cars on the road while I was there. I didn't see it move, but it was definately hovering.  The road I was on ran along the Lake Michigan shoreline, up on the bluff.  I was about 200-300 feet away from it, I certainly didn't want to get out of my car and check it out.  It was sitting in a side yard of the only house in the area and if it makes a difference, it was across the street from the very large Whirlpool Administration Building. This is the first time I ever reported this, my family told me not to tell anyone, we live in a small town. :-);42.1089086206897;-86.4268465517242
