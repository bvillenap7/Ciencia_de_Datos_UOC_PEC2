There were six of us out the next night on 10/29/00. My kids were trying to film their own version of Blaire Witch Project. My son noticed an unusually bright star in the southern sky. We have been visiting the area for 20 years and never saw anything like it.  I attempted to report at that time and got many skeptical laughs. I did get many minutes of videos.  We saw a bright white light that was changing colors to an orange and then would explode with a ring of light and then shrink. When we took the video home we saw that the object wasn't changing colors, it was just rotating.  It even showed what looked like some type of support structure. I would be willing to give more details if interested.;44.7223;-84.0568
