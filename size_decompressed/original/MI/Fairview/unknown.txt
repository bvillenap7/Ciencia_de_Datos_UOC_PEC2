Twinkling white, blue, red and green hovering light along with fireball object.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD));2015-01-12 19:00:00;3 hours;Twinkling white, blue, red and green hovering light along with fireball object I was going outside to start my vehicle, when I looked up at the stars.  We live in a small town, and having no city lights does wonders for stargazing.   I noticed a very bright, twinkling “star”.  Both my husband and I have seen it before, so I watched it for a bit to make sure it was the same thing I had seen.  Both times, I noticed it was moving in odd directions, up, down, diagonal, and sometimes a sort of circle.    I also noticed it was not only white but flashed some blue and red, with possibly some green.  I watched it for a long time to make sure I was seeing what I thought I was.  I went in to tell my husband and we watched it together.  My kids saw us staring at the sky and started watching and noticed the twinkling lights as well.  It was visible for a few hours and I think the clouds dimmed it out and it just faded away.   During that time, maybe half an hour before we lost visual contact, we saw what looked like a comet or fireball in the sky.  For a split second I thought it was a shooting star, but when I thought about it, it was most definitely NOT a shooting star, way too close and very big, and the “twinkling star” was most definitely NOT a star because as far as I know, stars don’t move.   I cannot tell the shape of the object because it’s a little too far away, but it doesn't move like any craft I am aware of. ((NUFORC Note:  A possible sighting of Sirius, we suspect??
