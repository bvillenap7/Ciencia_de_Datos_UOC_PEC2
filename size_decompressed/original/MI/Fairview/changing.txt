Sighting in Northern Michigan 10/28/00;2000-10-28 19:30:00;5 minutes;Sighting in Northern Michigan 10/28/00 Saw a non familiar star in the southern sky while up north. It only moved twice. It changed shapes from round to eliptical. It was pulsating, not blinking like an aircraft. In fact it changed colors from yellow to white to red. Several times it burst into a large reddish area, disappeared then came back. The witnesses used binoculars, photo camera, and I filmed all except the last minute. The object at one point was circular with pulsing rings around a dot.During the last minute two more objects came and joined up with this one formed a triangle, then a line, then at that time we saw aircraft approaching, then the objects just vanished. My son claims to have seen the same thing at home last night next to the moon. I had a hard time filming because of the light.;44.7223;-84.0568
