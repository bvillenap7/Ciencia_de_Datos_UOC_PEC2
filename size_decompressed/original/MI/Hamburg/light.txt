Three times this object appeared, dissapeeared and reappeared Was on the boat with my dog.  I pulled up to a neighbor boat.  After floating for only a minute we both observed an orange light that was very bright.  It just appeared out of no where.  We both shut off our radios and motors and could not hear any noise from an engine.  This orange light approached us and appeared to be only 500 ft away.  It then began to move east towards Metro airport.  Just after the light faded. It instantly re-apperared in the same spot it was first seen.  This happened three times and did the same flight pattern as the first.  This is the second time that I has witnessed such an occurence on the same lake.;42.453;-83.8098
