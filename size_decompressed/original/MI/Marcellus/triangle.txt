Aloha  I am not the person who saw this craft, my brother did.;1986-08-01 20:00:00;2 min.;Aloha  I am not the person who saw this craft, my brother did. He was coming home from work near dusk on the same day the folks saw the triangle over Bankson lake in Lawton Mi.  What he told me is, he was coming home on M216? When up head of his truck he saw a GIANT triangle craft (black with lights on the tips) going very slow right above some high voltage wires (right over them!) He then stopped his truck and got out to see it just before where the powerline crossed the road.  He watched (from outside his truck) as the craft went over the road right in front of him.......I remember him telling me it was bigger than a 747 and going 10 to 20 mph.......(floating!) From what he said, he was only a 100 ft or so away, he saw it VERY CLEARLY!  He never told me about it until 10 years later when we just happened to be talking about UFOs, one thing about my brother, he doesn't lie or embellish stories! If he said he saw this, he did! I did know about the Bankson lake sighting, he told me it was on that same day. I am not sure how far Bankson lake is from Marcellus, but I think they are fairly near to each other.  Just thought I would share this, since I think the truth is about to be revealed to everyone............very soon)  aloha from Hawaii ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
