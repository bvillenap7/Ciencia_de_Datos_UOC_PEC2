((anonymous report));2018-02-16 23:45:00;3 minutes;Walked outside and immediately noticed a huge white Chemtrail being made, from West to East.   Then I looked up to the East and saw 5 jets making more trails covering the sky and obscuring the night sky.  Then right above the concentration of jets a huge fireball came across the sky at high speed covered in flames and sparks traveling from North to South.   The Fireball then disappeared from view.   Note:  This occurred in the same exact area that had a meteor strike last month that shook the Earth causing a small earthquake.
