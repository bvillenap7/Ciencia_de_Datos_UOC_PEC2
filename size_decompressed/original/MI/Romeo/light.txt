Glowing light hovering and rising slowly then shooting across dky.;1991-08-07 21:15:00;2-5 minutes;Glowing light hovering and rising slowly then shooting across dky. The object was a glow of light about 2 feet wide with an orange tint.  It had a glow around the light signifying that it was bright.  It was hovering approximitly what looked like 10 yards sbove the road. I was heading west on 32 mile passing the romeo high school when i saw the glowing object. I quickly pulled off into the school parkinglot but tree were blocking my view. Pulled out to the road and the object was higher and no longer directly above the road. I quickly pulled across the street into a sub to get a better view. The object seemed to just be hovering in the air. It was slowly moving up at a very slow speed the object continued to do this till about 50 yards above ground.  I then yelled out my car window to see if it would change the pattern of it.  At this point the object moved a quick speed heading north east. I continued to watch the object but from the point it started moving it was gone in a matter of 5-10 seconds.;42.8366;-83.0396
