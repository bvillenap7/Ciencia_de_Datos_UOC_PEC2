Strange light, Craft and Motion;1973-08-15 23:20:00;10-15 minutes;Strange light, Craft and Motion Friend and I were walking west to our camping spot and noticed a strange color light to the north at treetop level.  Not only was the light strange the shape and motion also was different.  It was a orangish yellow color in a parallelogram shape tumbling head over heels so to speak.  My friend was frightened as we both said what is that, within minutes a guy my friend knew stopped where we were and asked us if we saw it.  Seems that he was coming home from work (2nd shift) when his motorcycle died on him, than the craft silently flew (tumbled) over him.  He restarted his bike and stopped when he met us on the private lane.  He was fairly animated and distraught from the experience which only made my friend more concerned about camping out that night.  We got to our tent and I had to convince him to stay, I told him I'd sleep outside and he could stay in the tent if I saw anything else I would wake him.  This is where it gets stranger.  I believe we both fell asleep.  I had a strange dream this night and it was recurring for years, where I was running and trying to hide from a creature and every time it catches meI  Wake up.   I woke up that night and went in the tent and my friend wasn't in there, so I went home.  The next day I asked what happened, he said he heard a noise and looked out for me and I was gone.  So he went home and got to bed at 02:00, I got home at 04:00.  We never really talked about this ever and I don't know why, I reached out to him in later years and he still refuses to talk about this.  I believe that this was my 2nd experience with the first happening in Detroit in spring of 1966.;42.1219;-85.5061
