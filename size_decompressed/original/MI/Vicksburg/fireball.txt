We had been deer hunting all day and were discussing the day's events when I caught a light out of the corner of my eye. The picture window in the living room was directly to my back and I looked up and saw this orangish (extremely bright!) object followed by several other smaller but similar objects streaking across the sky from southwest to northeast in direction. I yelled at my friend to look, look now, hurry!, he jumped out of his chair and looked out the window and saw the last 2-3 seconds of it. Through the window I would guess that I had a view of approximately 20% of the sky and I saw the object for 8-10 seconds.  I know you have a lot of reports on this but thought you might like another. The time and date are specific as I checked the clock immediately.  I am an avid meteor watcher.  I try to observe all the meteor showers and was going to go out later that night to try to see some that were expected but did not plan on seeing anything like this. The meteor shower for the 17th was a total dud in this area except for this fireball which I do not believe was related at all.  I have seen many shooting stars, some quite amazing and none of them begin to match this one size, brightness or duration!;42.1219;-85.5061
Streak of light heading up at a 60d angle.  It looked just like a meteor, but going up, not coming down.;2013-08-12 19:00:00;second;Streak of light heading up at a 60d angle.  It looked just like a meteor, but going up, not coming down. I was talking on the phone with my nephew when I was looking out the window to the South West.  I saw what I would describe as a reverse meteor.  It went up from the ground at about 50-60d angle at 2-3 times the speed of a meteor.   If it were coming down, I would have said it was a meteor, but to go up on an angle!!??  Now there was a storm heading our way, but I know the difference between lighting and a streak heading into the upper atmosphere.  I would say it looked similar to the way fireworks would go up, but many, many times faster.  It went as far as I could see in a flash. If it werenâ€™t for a darker grey sky in the background with the storm coming, it probably would have never been noticed.;42.1219;-85.5061
