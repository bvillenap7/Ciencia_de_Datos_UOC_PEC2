10+ bright lights traveling in serial over West Michigan  ((Starlink satellites?));2019-12-22 19:30:00;5 minutes;10+ bright lights traveling in serial over West Michigan At approximately 1930 on December 22, 2019, I was sitting in the hot tub outdoors enjoying the winter weather and the bright, clear sky over Michigan. I had just asked my children which star they thought was the brightest in the sky, and as I looked west, I noticed at least four bright lights traveling in serial across the sky, fading as they traveled further as if disappearing into the distance. They were traveling in a straight line, appearing perfectly spaced from one another and traveling along the same exact path. As they traveled further and began to disappear one at a time, new lights continued to appear from over the tree line until at least 10 of them had traveled along the same exact path and disappeared. The lights had the same appearance as stars, but shone much brighter and were obviously far closer. They did not move like, or appear to be, airplanes.  Based on experiences I had in the military, my initial impression was that these might have been missiles or rockets being test-fired over Lake Michigan from a launch point somewhere in West Michigan â€“ possibly near the area of St Joseph based on where they appeared to be coming from. However, I am unaware of any launch or test sites in this area.;42.1219;-85.5061
