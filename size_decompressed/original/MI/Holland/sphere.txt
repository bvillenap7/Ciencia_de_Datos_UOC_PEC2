Planet-like spherical light in area where no planets should have been;2005-03-03 21:30:00;1 minute;Planet-like spherical light in area where no planets should have been My brother was driving me home from work and I was looking out the window at the stars because the sky was nice and clear. In the northwest I could see the constellation Cassiopeia and underneath it, approximately 10 degrees above the horizon was a amber colored spherical light. It was larger than a star and wasn't moving so I assumed it was probably Mars. The light was slowly fading and getting brighter like thin clouds were passing in front of it, but I could not see any clouds in that direction. As we drove along it became obscured by trees, and I lost sight of it. I didn't really think it was unusual until I checked 2 separate sky maps and there were no planets in that area on the maps. The object was somewhere between the constellations Andromeda and Lacerta. An airplane flew past approximately 5 degrees above the object, but I'm not sure whether it was at the same distance as the sphere. I told my brother there was something in the sky, but he missed it because the trees hid it when he turned to look.;42.7942118741068;-86.1231163090135
A solid colored vehicle moving at high speed whith no characteristics of anything registered to fly in our airspace.;2014-07-04 21:30:00;2-5 minutes each;A solid colored vehicle moving at high speed whith no characteristics of anything registered to fly in our airspace. We were in my back yard which is a rectangle and the rear behind the house faces north. We were just waiting for dark to light off fireworks when someone noticed a red-ish/orange-ish ball of light.  The first time I saw it, it was in the southeast sky moving rapidly northeast. It had a height of maybe 10 to 15 thousand feet off the ground.  Comparing this to a balloon or parachute, there is no way to move a balloon or parachute that fast. The second time I saw it, the sky was still light yet and it was as if the ball of light appeared from nowhere then moved from north to south at a very high speed.  I quickly ran into the house and got my binoculars and when I ran back out it was gone. Finally, the third time I saw one was Saturday night while having a campfire in the middle of the night.  About 1 or 2 am on the 5th of July.  I saw it come from the north off in the distance very far away.  It moved very fast towards us and disappeared behind the trees in a duration of about 2 to 3 minutes.  No blinking lights, one luminous color only.  This is not known military or civilian.  Parachutes and balloons cannot move like that and go that fast. One of us (not myself) is an honorably discharged marine who served in Afghanistan recently.;42.7942118741068;-86.1231163090135
