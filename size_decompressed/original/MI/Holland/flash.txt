Bright white flash and strange whirring sound on clear night.;2004-10-24 23:15:00;1-2 seconds;Bright white flash and strange whirring sound on clear night A friend and I were taking a walk outside at around 11:15 pm. We stopped for a minute and were standing in the middle of the road talking, when the whole sky lit up for about a second with bright white light. Neither of us saw any object or meteor, and the light came from the west. The moon was shining in the southwest, and the flash was brighter than the moonlight. We noticed there were no clouds anywhere in the sky, and ruled out the possibility of lighting because of that and the fact that we didn't hear any thunder afterwards. We did, however, hear a strange whirring or buzzing for about 4 or 5 seconds immediately following the flash. We walked in the direction the light came from and up a hill to see if we could see any objects in the sky, but we didn't see anything else. I don't know if it's relevent, but my ears started making random clicking noises soon after we saw the flash and have been doing so now for about 4 hours.
