Spotted a group of bright lights, low in the sky, hovering over a parking lit with a near by water tower.  The lights ranged from white to green to red.  However on my phone (started videotaping) some purple lights were recorded as well.  The group of lights didn't move a lot, hovered mostly, for about 25 minutes before moving further west towards Lake Michigan.   At that point 4 of us hopped in my car and tried to follow it.  When we reached the parking lot , 30 seconds away, the group of lights suddenly turned into a V formation and has a small cluster of lights next to that.   As the V formation and cluster of lights seemed to form from the previous hovering lights, it went from being super low and close, in the sky, to higher up and appeared further away.  However, when we stepped out of car to look at it, the V formation and cluster of little lights appeared to be right overhead.  The top left light, the brightest one, of the V formation kep flashing the red, green, white and sometimes Orange.   The strange thing about all of this was when I was recording the hovering lights initially I had no problem getting on tape.  When I pulled out my phone to record the V formation and cluster of lights NOTHING would show up on the screen/recording.  The V formation gradually appeared to move further back, towards Lake Michigan,  very slowly over the next 45-55 minutes.  But was still easily visible for a long time after that.  One thing we all noticed about the V formation was the bottom two lights on the left kept moving in and out of the formation, from side to side, constantly.  It was very strange and fascinating!!!!!;42.7942118741068;-86.1231163090135
