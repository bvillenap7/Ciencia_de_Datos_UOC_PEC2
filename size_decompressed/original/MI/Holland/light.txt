bright flashing lights;1998-02-09 04:00:00;seconds;bright flashing lights my husband was sitting in a parking lot off m-40 in Holland, Michigan about 4am on the morning of Feb. 9, 1998.  He saw real bright intense white light flashes.  Too bright to see where they came from.  Only lasted a brief second.  Three flashes total.  Can't remember if it was clear or cloudy skies.  This is the second time he has seen these lights.  We were outside about midnight back in July or August of 1996. Both times it was like someone had a flash bulb, the light is that intense, almost like lightning.  Both times their has not been any thunderstorms or bad weather.  Just wondering what this could possible be.;42.7942118741068;-86.1231163090135

We were lighting off fireworks and I looked in the sky and saw a bright light moving very slow and I said look a UFO and two other people saw it and we watch it turn around and move away slowly disappearing into space! I would say that it was very far away!;42.7942118741068;-86.1231163090135
weird moving lights in North east part of Holland's Sky;2006-08-12 03:00:00;over 3 hours;weird moving lights in North east part of Holland's Sky Well i have seen this light in the sky is the same area for the past couple months. I will be sitting in the back of my truck and i will notice that it was moving in circles. So Saturday (8/12/06) i grabed my fathers video camera and I have video of it.. My little sister was there watching it with me when i was filming. but there was no talking. While watching the video it changes colors. you can see it moving like crazy then it will change into a blur, like a haze around it.. I showed it to my mom the next day and my brother and his friend and they tell me that is messed up.. It you look at the North east part of the sky in the holland area you will see it.. matter a fact it was there just tonight, and i am sure its still there.. I am almost positive that it is not a satalight, plane, planet or star. The video that i took there is VERY VERY little movements of my hands, i used my trucks side wall of the bed for stability.;42.7942118741068;-86.1231163090135

I looked at the other stars to compare.  The other stars were not acting the same.   I stayed in one position for 45 minutes and used a very mature white pine tree as a point of reference.   It became apparent that the star wasn't a star but a hovering object moving very slowly in the sky.  I took a picture the first night.;42.7942118741068;-86.1231163090135
