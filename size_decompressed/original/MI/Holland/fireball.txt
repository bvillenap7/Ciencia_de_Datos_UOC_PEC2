Green light streaking vertically towards Lake Michigan;2004-07-22 23:30:00;3 seconds;Green light streaking vertically towards Lake Michigan A friend and I were sitting on the beach, talking and having a cigarette, at approximately 11:30 p.m. In mid sentence he said, Hey! Look at that! so I quick turned my head and observed a bright green light descending rapidly in a straight vertical line. The light faded before reaching the water, and travelled a distance of approximately 2 hand lengths with arm extended. It did not explode like a firework or a boat flare normally would.  There were no boats visible on the lake at the time, and it was too far over the water to have been a firework launched from the shore. We also did not hear any sound come from the object.  It's possible that it may have been a meteor. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));42.7942118741068;-86.1231163090135
2 bright orange/red balls moving SSE to NNW (one after the other) across sky in approximately 10 seconds.;2016-08-23 22:20:00;<1 minute;2 bright orange/red balls moving SSE to NNW (one after the other) across sky in approximately 10 seconds. 8/23/2016  10:20 pm  Holland, MI.  I would like to report 2 rather bright orange balls that I just saw travelling in a straight line SSE to NNW direction.  I observed these objects from the deck and driveway of my home in Holland, MI.   The objects had no strobes, and were much brighter and quicker than e.g. Chinese lanterns.  (Note that it is quite still out ... not even a breeze.)  Each object traversed at a steady pace across the sky in approximately 10 seconds.  No sounds.   The first one disappeared to the NNW into light cloud cover.  That may help you understand the altitude.  About 15 seconds after the first disappeared from sight, a second followed the same track from SSE to NNW ... same apparent speed and altitude.  The second seemed more red than orange on the travelling front edge of the ball.  Hard to say the true size, since an actual distance couldn't really be determined.  From my view, they both appeared to be about the size of a pea in the night sky (fairly clear out this! evening, with a nice view of the stars).  I wouldn't exactly call them fireballs, but they did have something of that look to them color/texture wise.;42.7942118741068;-86.1231163090135
