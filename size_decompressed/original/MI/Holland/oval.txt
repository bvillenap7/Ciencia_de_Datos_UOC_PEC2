Two white objects flying twice the speed of other jet aircraft, following the flight path of a plane that had just flown over.;2020-08-18 15:30:00;~5-8 seconds;Two white objects flying twice the speed of other jet aircraft, following the flight path of a plane that had just flown over. I am a recently retired Engineering Standards Lead for a major aviation company.  On August 18, 2020, my wife and I were riding our bikes and took a break at approximately 3:15 PM.  We typically rest in a grassy area adjacent to a golf course about 3 miles from Lake Michigan, where we have a clear view of most of the sky.  We saw a couple commercial jet aircraft, and one that we watched heading east seemed to be a bit different from the usual aircraft we see.  Shortly after that plane flew over, we saw two white objects that appeared a bit oval in shape, flying east at about twice the speed of the other jet aircraft we observed.  The objects then varied their flight path and turned to the south east, where we lost track of them in some clouds.  We haven't been able to find any other info about the incident.;42.7942118741068;-86.1231163090135
