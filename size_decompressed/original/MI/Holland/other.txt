2 star like objects heading east as if one directly followed other. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.  PD));2009-09-08 21:20:00;2-3 min;2 star like objects heading east as if one directly followed other Just happened to have walked outside to check the pool filter, looked up to see if the stars were out, pretty full night sky, the moon was not up yet.   I live on a direct e-w road, so direction is correct.   In the direct sky above me, I thought I saw a brighter than normal star at say 1 o'clock position looking north.   Shortly (within 4-5 seconds) another bright star appeared at 11 oclock position, both were moving at a faster than normal speed for any aircraft, both were direct path of each other, both moving in same north-eastern direction.  Both passed over the tree line horizon.   Far brighter than normal star(s) but far dimmer than Mars  in southern sky. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS and Space Shuttle in formation.
