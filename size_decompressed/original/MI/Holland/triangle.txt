I was on a long stretch of road around 11:45 p.m. Wednesday night and saw a small grouping of bright white lights on my right hand side off in the distance coming down towards the ground quite fast, and thought it was maybe a plane coming into the airport nearby, but as I got closer so did the lights to the ground.  Then I next realized that it was a few miles in front of me now crossing the road I was on. I sped up and got to where it was just on the other side on the road Hovering above the tree tops on the left side of the road about a quarter of a mile off the main road (that I was on).  It was a strange shape like a triangular shape with lights on each corner and on light in the middle.  It hovered there for a solid minute, as I watched the lights in my rear view mirror I turned around and headed back towards it. As I turned around and headed back towards the lights I noticed it went straight up as if it were hovering like a helicopter taking off and when I looked again it shot really fast across the road and it was gone.  Gone. I came to the clearing in the trees where a field was and you could see the open sky and land for miles and there was nothing.  The lights/object had completely vanished.;42.7942118741068;-86.1231163090135

Dark object on a clear night.  Triangular in shape, similar to a B52 stealth bomber.  Was witnessed by three people.   No sound was noticed and extremely dim lights might have been present.   Blocked out stars and moved through the sky at a rapid rate.   Disappeared from sight within five seconds or so.;42.7942118741068;-86.1231163090135
