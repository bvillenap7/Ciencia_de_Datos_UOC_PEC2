Well I'm always up all night and I only smoke outside,so it was just before 4:00AM,as I was lighting my ciggarette it kinda caught my eye(I like looking at the stars,but I'm not literate to the field)anyway I figured it was a star twinkling,it was east of me what seemed at least 1 mile away and at medium altitude(mabe small plane average)and it was a blue light above a white one,the white brighter or bigger.I didnt hear any aircraft around and that's when I noticed what seem to be little red lights sort of ringing the bigger blue one because the blue light seem to lean over and the white one(beneath it)went evenly the opposing direction.I could see like a straight line between the blue and white when they did this.It acted like an axis smoothly to my right twice,that's when I saw the red lights. All this being said one final note,all the lights and straight line seemed a sort of blur as if the object was spinning,the line might have been the shadow casted from the white and blue lights on the object when it leaned(the line not being true in appearance),but uprighted seemed to disappear along with the red light(s).To finish,I was getting cold and done with the smoke and honestly I didn't want to believe what I thought I had seen,perhaps being slightly affraid.HEY WHO KNOWS? MOST THINGS CAN BE EXPLAINED AND THOSE THAT CAN'T ARE ONLY PONDERED ON.;42.7942118741068;-86.1231163090135
