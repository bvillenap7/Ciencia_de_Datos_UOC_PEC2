I heard what sounded like a helicopter hovering outside my window, I just moved to this small town so I was eager to see my first helicopter since being here. Well upon going out side to see it, I quickly learned it was in fact not a helicopter.  It was cylinder shaped almost like a helicopter except it had no tail and was more of a cylinder shape.  It was approx. 15-20 ft above our 2 story roof and there were 2 bright, white, round, lights on the bottom in a row one in the front almost like headlights as well as one on each side but none on the back other than the on on the bottom in the rear. there were also 2 very small red lights on the right and left side and had what liiked like a fin or something attached o the craft's side which almost had me beliving it could have been a plane for a split second before realizing those were not the lights of any aircraft I've seen.  There was also almost a haze of fogg around the craft, it was very cloudy skies but the ! craft was too low I think for the clouds to cause it.;42.7942118741068;-86.1231163090135
