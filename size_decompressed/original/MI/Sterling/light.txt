PD));2016-07-04 01:00:00;~2 minutes;While star gazing and pointing out satellites, we were watching what we thought was a satellite when its intensity brightened making its size appear larger.  This brightness lasted for a few seconds and then dimmed back to a normal satellite looking size.   A second satellite came into our view starting off large and bright and then dimming.  I saw the same thing a few years back in the same location.   Do photo satellites have a flash?  I didn't think so but that was the only theory that we all hit on with the exception of UFO.
