Triangular glow races across Michigan sky on 3-14-2012 at around 11 pm;2012-03-14 23:00:00;3 seconds;Triangular glow races across Michigan sky on 3-14-2012 at around 11 pm I saw a massive triangle that had a hazy glow travelling North West at an incrededible speed.  It travelled in a straight line and went across the sky so fast that had I not been looking up into the sky I would have missed it. It took about 3 seconds to travel over half the distance of the sky before it dissappeared.  My 10 year old son saw it before me but I can not attest to what exactly he saw.  I have played this over in my head a hundred times and it seemed that this object was way up in the upper atmosphere.  This makes no sense.  It had to have been thousands of feet across to be seen from the ground.  There is no possible way this object was man made.  It travelled way too fast. I have been trying to come up with a different explanation for what I saw but I have come to the same conclusion that I had as it appeared and disappeared the night before last.  This was an aircraft not of this world.;44.0687;-84.0487
