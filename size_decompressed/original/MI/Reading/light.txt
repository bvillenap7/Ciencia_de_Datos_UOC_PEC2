My girlfriend and I were paddle boating on her lake looking at the stars, satellites, and planes when we saw what looked like a very bright star moving NE in a slight zigzag/weaving motion quite rapidly.  We had time to watch it cross the sky for a bit then it quickly faded into space and we didn't see anything like it again that night.  Unfortunately we didn't have our cameras/phones with us. We've been casual star-gazers for a little while now and this is our first experience.  We know enough to know that this was unusual.  It was really cool!;41.8436;-84.7658
