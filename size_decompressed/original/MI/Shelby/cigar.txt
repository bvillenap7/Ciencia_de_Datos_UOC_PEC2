Shinny silver tube craft no wings - some dark areas.;2005-09-02 13:22:00;one miniute;Shinny silver tube craft no wings - some dark areas. Driving home from work on US 31, I noticed what appeared to be a jet in a cloudless blue ski to my west.  The object appeared out over lake michigan near the coast a few thousand feet up in the ski.  I kept looking at the what I thought was a plane (Many jets fly over this area close to my home), I could not see the wings.  The object was shiny silver with some dark.  Usually I notice planes moving but this object appeared to be stationery.  I kept looking at the object expecting to see some movement or wing but did not.  At the last citing if it were a plane it would not have left my viewing ( I have seen many jets). The object simply vanished.;43.03208;-84.35968
