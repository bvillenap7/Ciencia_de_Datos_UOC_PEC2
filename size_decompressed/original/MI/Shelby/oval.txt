Circular bright object flying in sky from north to south along Lake Michigan in Shelby, Michigan.;2019-07-30 23:00:00;2-3 minutes;Circular bright object flying in sky from north to south along Lake Michigan in Shelby, Michigan. We were enjoying the meteor shower on the beach of Lake Michigan off the private community of Cobmoosa Shores in Shelbym Michigan.  We witnessed several shooting stars and satellites.  It was myself, my partner, our 12 year old son and his friend.  This bright circle sphere oval was very large and coming from the north.  It travelled past us and we continued to watch it and suddenly it disappeared.  While we were observing the only person who had a phone was my son and I asked him to take a video but he didnâ€™t LISTEN and just took a picture.  As clear as the sky was though the only thing that pleated was this unifentified flying object, not even a single star of the millions we seen showed up with it.   We continued to watch after this observation to see if satellites disappeared or we could see across the whole sky we could.  We watched airplanes to see the same.   On our way home near Kokomo, Indiana, strange things were happening on our car map which made me look into things and figured I should report this.;43.03208;-84.35968
