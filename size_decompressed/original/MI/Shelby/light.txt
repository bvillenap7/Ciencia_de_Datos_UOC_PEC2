 It looked like a star but would change to a lite blue, to red, to star white. ((NUFORC Note:  Star or planet?  PD));2016-08-05 00:00:00;~6 minutes;Drove from utah to michigan with wide and daughters to get my son and was staying with my sister and parents at their place in shelby.  I belive it was the night of 5 august 2016, between 11pm and midnight,  and my brother and I was outside drinking it up as I had to head back to utah the next morning.  My brother said ((deleted)) dude is that a ufo?  I said your drunk dude I don't see anything.   Then he pointed it out to me.  It was to the west, like over lake michigan, which was about 15 mins away.  It looked like a star but would change to a lite blue, to red, to star white.  It would move from left to right then down then up and back left, and then go though it's colors again.  I couldn't belive it and ran inside and woke my whole family up.  My dad was amazed, my mom and sisters didn't know what to think, my daughters were amazed,  and it freaked the heck out of my 13 yr old son.  We can't have been the only ones to see this.  It was incredible!;43.03208;-84.35968
