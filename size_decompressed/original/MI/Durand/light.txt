This part is what struck me as strange the craft did a button hook and stoped abruptly as if someone or thing had parked it. Witnessed by longtime friend who veiwed the same object as I did.  Both of us will take a polygraph to confirm sighting is authentic. time was 9:15pm till 10:00pm. The small object was not a sattelite.;42.9059;-83.9938
Several scattered lights in sky slowly formed a single line.;2012-11-07 20:45:00;>10 minutes;Several scattered lights in sky slowly formed a single line. I was driving along i69 on my way toward Lansing from Flint when I looked over to see several red lights in the sky.  They were scattered around in no particular order, then slowly began forming a single straight line. I didn't watch them for more than a couple minutes to see what happened next but thought it was a strange occurance.;42.9059;-83.9938
