Possible crash.;2014-03-06 22:40:00;4 seconds;possible crash I looked out the passenger window of my car because a thought i saw a small explosion in the sky overhead.   I saw an oval shape with a very long tail indicating that it was burning up in the atmosphere.  It then split into two and went out.  It was glowing as it went out of view.   I saw several aircraft at multiple altitudes including a helicopter that followed the flight path of the object.;42.9059;-83.9938
