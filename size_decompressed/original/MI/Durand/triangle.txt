Got home at 11:11 and went to let my dog out. Clear sky. Looked up for a moment and noticed movement in the North West of my viewable sky. Three groups of two lights of a dim orange color. The lights traveled from the north west to the south east and did so in less than fifteen seconds. I did not hear anything. The groups of two lights were equal distance from one another and together they formed a triangle.;42.9059;-83.9938

Motionless and soundless.;2014-07-11 22:15:00;Drove by it;Black triangular object with red/ blue small lights, and a large spotlight-like light. Motionless and soundless. Driving home on Westbound 69 and saw triangular shape above treeline.  The object did not move like a normal aircraft would.   Phones froze when we tried to take pictures (iPhone 5s).   There were blue and red lights on the side as well as a large white light.  When directly under the unidentified object, we noticed the object was large and hovering without any noise.  The object remained in rear view mirror until we went around a curve.;42.9059;-83.9938
