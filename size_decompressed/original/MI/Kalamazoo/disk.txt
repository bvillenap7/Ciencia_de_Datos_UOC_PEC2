Close encounter near Kalamazoo;1977-11-15 22:30:00;2 min;Close encounter near Kalamazoo I was camping alone in the woods between Galesburg and Kalamazoo during an Indian Summer. At around 10:30.  I was stoking a small fire when I heard a sound like air rushing.  I did't think much of this initially because I was about a mile and a-half from the power plant and they release steam from time to time and it sounded like that. But, unusually, this time it was getting louder then louder until I realized something was very wrong, it seemed to be coming from all around me out of the darkness. I looked all around me but could only see a few trees dimly lit by the small fire, then I looked up. All the leaves were off of the trees and I could clearly see a circular craft drifting right above me over the tree tops in a Northerly direction. It appeared to be about a hundred feet above the tree tops. It had a dome structure on the bottom with a  cross structure as if for support with four green lights around the dome's edge.  There were alternating white and red lights around the outer edge of the craft. It may have had a slight glow to it. The tree tops did'nt move and it glided along then started to curve around to the West and went over a nearby gravel pit. I ran through the woods trying not to run into trees or trip in the dark.  I crossed a couple fields and fence lines until I came to the edge of the gravel pit where I could look down over it. I did'nt see the craft and don't know where it went. I have read that UFO activity increases during years of close passes of Earth and Mars and this was one of those years.
