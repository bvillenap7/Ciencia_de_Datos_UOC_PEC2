Large triangular craft, no lights or sound, spotted at low altitude.;2007-03-30 21:30:00;1-2 min.;Large triangular craft, no lights or sound, spotted at low altitude. I was driving east on Kilgore road, at approx. 9:30pm Friday. On that route, I noticed something in the sky heading north, moving I would estimate at about 40mph. I’m also estimating the altitude of this craft was 1,000 ft. The craft was a triangular shape, coming to form a right angle for pretty much the entire length of the craft. I’m estimating the length to be 200-300 yards, and the width to be around 100 yards. There were absolutely no lights on the craft, nor were there any discernable markings. It appeared to be black in color, but it was dark outside so it was hard to distinguish any color. There was no noise associated with it either.  I stopped the car and got out, watching this craft as it continued north and out of sight range. Myself, being the founder of our local paranormal investigating team, I went through the proper channels to make sure this was a genuine sighting. I checked with dispatch to which there weren’t any calls coming in to report it, and I also checked with NWS to see if it might have been a low level cloud, to which there were not any low clouds in the area. If needed, I will submit a sketch of the craft.;42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897
((HOAX??))  Triangular black craft with 6 lights on the bottom flew behind my house.;2007-06-07 23:00:00;30 seconds to a minute;Triangular black craft with 6 lights on the bottom flew behind my house. I was facing the window above my bed while reading a novel. It was just before 11pm and I saw lights in my peripheral vision coming from outside.  I looked up and saw this triangular craft that was too dark to make out against the night sky but had three lights at each corner and three lights in the center of the bottom, all of which formed two triangles, one inside the other.  It flew rather low, I would estimate it as being about two inches wide and I don't know how far away it was from my house.   It flew from north-east to almost directly west.  It was in plain sight for at least 30 seconds and then went behind the trees. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax.  One of several reports from the same source, and they seem to us only marginally credible.  We may be wrong.  Source describes herself as a college student.  PD));42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897
It was very bright!!  Like fire orange bright, and it had 3 lights all orange in color on the bottom.;2015-10-25 20:40:00;5 minutes;We were on our way home tonight on D Ave.  When in the sky I could see what almost looked like one of those candle lanterns off in the distance.  I could quickly tell as fast as I said what the heck is that, that it was NOT one of those.  It was moving towards us going in the opposite direction we where traveling.  As it got closer and bigger I could totally tell it was not a plane, copter or anything like. It was very bright!!  Like fire orange bright, and it had 3 lights all orange in color on the bottom.   I have no clue what it was and I have not been able to find anything online to explain it.  We quickly turned around in a driveway and tried to chase it, but in the short time it took us to turn around we couldn't find it.  We went all back down the road to 131 expressway with no luck... Lots of jets in the sky because it was a clear night.  But this clearly was WAY to low to be a jet, was not a jet because of the light and man I'm just dumbfounded.  Wondering if others have seen the same thing.  It was just so so bright…;42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897
