Went back in house to get spouse and when we came out it was gone.  A few minutes later thru a window I could see a blinking red light behind the trees.  My spouse said it must be a tower, but in the morning I couldn't see any. I went outside to chain up our dog.  I noticed an orange cone shaped object glowing above the trees.  I thought it was the moon at first, but it was too odd shaped with a slight fuzziness around it.   I went back into the house to get my husband but when we came back out it was gone.  A few minutes later I went into one our bedrooms and glanced out the window and between the trees I could see a blinking red light which my spouse witnessed too.  About half hour later I could still see the light.  My spouse thought it was a tower, but in the morning I went out back to check it out and could not see a tower.  I was looking West from behind our home toward Alamo Twp.   We had just turned off all the lights in our home to go to bed when I had seen this.  There was no sound coming from this.;42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897
A slightly conical black UFO hovered for roughly 10 minutes over Kalamazoo, Michigan.;2007-05-06 12:35:00;10 minutes;A slightly conical black UFO hovered for roughly 10 minutes over Kalamazoo, Michigan. The slightly conical, black or dark colored craft was hovering to the east of my house in direct view of the kitchen sky light that faces east. At first I thought it was something on the window so I moved my head from side to side and found that it was actually something in the sky. It hovered for about two minutes and maybe for longer but I ran to yell for my parents to come see it. After they came down I couldn't find it again until it started moving east at a slow speed, getting smaller and less conical in shape. I'm sure it wasn't changing shape but because it was farther away it was harder to see it. My parents were able to see it  for a few minutes while it was drifting east. I grabbed a pair of binoculars and ran outside to get a closer look but was unable to find it with the binoculars and focus them to see it clearly. A minute or two later it passed behind my neighbors' trees and I was no longer able to see it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
