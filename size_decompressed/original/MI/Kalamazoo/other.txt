It covered the complete sky at a speed slightly slower than a falling star.. but this was not a falling star. My friend and I were floating on rafts on Pickeral lake not too far from Sprinkle Road and Kilgore.. by a Winery in Climax Scotts.  We were just relaxing on the lake, it was quiet on the lake and were were anckored down so we wouldn't move.  The night was slightly chilly so we didn't go swimming like usual, but the stars were very clear, and everything was rather calm.  I saw something moving very fast across the sky at first I thought it was a shooting star because I have seen a number of them at that lake, but this did not dissipate like meteors do.  Then I noticed that it was making strange and sharp turns and jumps side to side, I alerted my friend who then quickly picked up on the sight.  He saw the strange jigs and jumps it was making and the speed at which it was traveling.  We were both amazed because we had never seen anything like that before.  We have told a couple of people but most just say Oh.. that's nice.;42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897
Another sighting from Kalamazoo;2003-08-15 20:30:00;20 sec;Another sighting from Kalamazoo I was camping in the woods between Galesburg and Kalamazoo sitting by a small fire when I suddenly heard a very loud sound coming from the direction of the gravel pit which was approx. 300 yards from my camp.  It sounded like a Kawasaki motor cycle reved to about 15,000+ RPM's!   I jumped up to see if I could spot it but saw nothing. The sound lasted only about 15 sec then was gone. The next day one of the farm hands came by and told me some local kids were riding their dirt bikes in the gravel pit when they saw a craft take off out of there. I asked him if it was at about 8:30 last night and he said yes it was.  I told him I heard the thing take off. He asked me if it would be alright if the kids came back there to talk to me about it because they thought they were nuts.  I told him it was. The kids stopped by and told me what it looked like.  They said it looked like a barbell or two vertically positioned disks with a tube between connecting the disks.  I guess it looked like Darth Vader's fighter craft (!) which seems very odd indeed. The next day I took a walk down to the gravel pit to see if there were any marks on he ground.  I found an odd looking depression in the gravel.  It was conical like you would expect as if someone had removed some ground in gravel and the sides caved in to form a cone shape but, there was no sign of the removed dirt nearby!  It was as if something was extracted from underneath and the gravel settled back down into to the space below. There are some strange goings ons at this gravel pit during years of near Earth/Mars approaches as during my report of 1977. I would like to note that this year 2003 was a near pass year between Earth and Mars. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Four Orbs in one object flying above Kalamazoo;2007-06-09 18:25:00;15 Minutes;Four Orbs in one object flying above Kalamazoo I was swimming in our pool, with 8 kids, when we sighted brilliant flickering lights in the NE direction at maybe 3/4 of a mile away at a height of 2,000' to 3,000' possibly.   It was much bigger than any helium balloons given at parties.  It appeared to be 4 circles bound together flashing green and sliver lights individually.   I ran into the house to get my glasses and my camera.  It continued a slow ascent away from us to the SE direction.  It would flicker from an almost imperceptible light until it flared up again like the light a star would give after dark.  A passing personal jet flew underneath it.   I have worked for Cessna and Boeing.  I have spent a lot of time around McConnell AFB and the object was higher than military aircraft and commercial aircraft.  I’d estimate it at 7 ½ miles high.  It than reversed course at an extremely slow speed and came back to us in a NNW heading until it was straight above our heads and it disappeared.   Balloons?  I don’t know what it was except it was unusual.;42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897

The light was incondescent looking and we could see more of the object that wasn't illuminated ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
