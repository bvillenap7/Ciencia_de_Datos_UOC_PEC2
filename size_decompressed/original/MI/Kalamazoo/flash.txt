It traveled from the ground to the clouds and split up into several parts. Sometime in March in the early morning my friend and I were traveling east on D avenue and somewhere around the cross street of N. Westnedge a bright red flash illuminated the whole sky, the ground, everything in the truck, it was like a flash of bright lightning.  The flash was so bright it lit everything as bright as day in red. It originated from the forest to our right, my view of the actual object was blocked by the truck but my friend said he saw something like a beam of light shoot from the ground into the low clouds as it traveled up it seemed to split up into different parts and travel through the clouds.  There were some low clouds around the area that were kind of thick but the whole sky was not covered, there were many parts of the sky that were clear, no thunderstorms or anything.  Though this left us in awe we did not report it to the police.  I just saw the report address in the Battle Creek Enquirer (local newspaper,) so I decided to report it.;42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897
