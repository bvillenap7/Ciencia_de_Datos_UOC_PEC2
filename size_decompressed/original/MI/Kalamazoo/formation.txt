I was working as a chemist at a large drug company in Kalamzoo, looking out of the window, which faced north. I observed what looked like birds at first. I was talking to a friend on the phone, asked him to hold while I went outside to get a better look. There were dozens of what looked like animals swimming in the surf , for lack of a better description. They were white, and seemed to be at an extreme height. They appeared to be riding the wind, but they were not. I am a hunter and am familiar with the flights of several birds, but these were not birds. The moved somewhat slowly from north to south. I knew they were strange and still dont know what they were, but I am cetain they were not animals. Whatever they were, it is clear they were under intelligent control. I am interested if you have ever heard this sort of thing before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897
