My wife and I went to smoke a cigarette at 8 am outside when she said, What is that?  I thought she was talking about a bird on a garage, and said that's what it was. &quot she said &quotno flying in the sky&quot I looked up with her and saw a very Shiny Silver Pill shaped object flying south, it appeared to have no wings and left absolutely no jet trail and also didn't make a sound.  We watched it for a minute and I was going to try and get a photo, there was a plane flying across it at a higher altitude and had the normal plane signs..' The UFO was going through a tree blocking my view and I went to the other side to get the picture and was waiting for it to come out the other end but it never did!  My wife asked if it shot upward because she didn't see it either...it really left us baffled!;42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897
