a little ball of light making little circles in the sky;1998-12-09 00:00:00;about 1 minute;a little ball of light making little circles in the sky I was in the batchroom and I thought I was seeing things, maybe that is still the case but I looked out the window and I saw the little ball of light and it wasn't too far up in the sky.  It was making circle motions fairly fast and then it would stop for a second and then start up again and I went outside to take a better look.  Well, it had started moving slowly toward me and when it passed over head I saw that there was a red light on it and I could hear it but it was a very low sound.  Not something that a plane would make I don't think.  So it might be my eyes deceiving me or it was indeed an unidentified flying object.;42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897
Fast blue light without sound in Kalamazoo.;2002-05-15 21:00:00;3 or 4 seconds;Fast blue light without sound in Kalamazoo. A blue, circular light moving fast to the northeast near Borgess Hospital in Kalamazoo MI.  No sound and no change in direction.  It was either very low and silent or very high and fast.  Others there saw me look up and move around the building we were near to see where it went but they weren't looking up in time to see it.  There is a heliport at the Hospital and an airport in the area but nothing matched this bright light. ((NUFORC Note:  The year of the incident is not indicated by the witness.  We assume that the witness implies a 2002 sighting, and we have assigned an arbitrary date in May of this year.  PD));42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897
((HOAX??))  White light moving east changed direction and then hovered for half an hour.;2008-03-08 01:00:00;33 minutes;White light moving east changed direction and then hovered for half an hour. I was in bed reading at one in the morning like I usually do on the weekend. Since my bed's headboard is against the wall with a window facing the backyard, and against the opposite wall is my dresser with a mirror on it, I can see out the window by looking into the mirror across from my bed. As I was reading in bed I saw a speck of white light going across the sky through the mirror, so I put my book down and looked out the window to watch it, and sure enough, it wasn't an airplane like I originally thought it was. As I watched, it flew west at about the speed of an airplane and then it started going in the opposite direction. It didn't stop or turn, it just all of a sudden started going east instead of west. Then, after it was behind the tree in my neighbor's backyard it stopped. I was still able to see it through the branches and after it hovered there for a couple minutes I ran and woke my parents up so they could see it, too. The three of us watched it for about twenty minutes, and it was moving very slowly east. Its speed was almost unnoticeable, east. After about twenty minutes the clouds came and covered the UFO so we couldn't see it anymore. My parents went back to sleep but I stayed up watching to see if the clouds would thin out enough to see it again. After I'd waited ten minutes the UFO turned red and continued on its eastward journey at its original speed. It seemed to have grown about twice its original size, but that might just be because it changed color and became brighter. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible hoax.  One of several reports from the same source, and they seem to us only marginally credible.  We may be wrong.  Source describes herself as a college student.  PD));42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897
Fast moving Orange light over Kalamazoo;2010-07-15 01:10:00;2min;Fast moving Orange light over Kalamazoo I had been home from work for about an hour and was online, when I realized I had forgotten my phone in the truck.  It was very dark outside and I was having trouble focusing to see where I was going, when I got to my truck and unlocked it, I just happened to look up in the sky to the west.   That’s when I saw this orange light very orange light it didn’t blink or flash and didn’t make a noise so there was no mistaking this as a plane and it was going too fast for it to be.   It continued to move north until it just disappeared.   I came inside and got on Google to see if there was anyone else that may have seen it and posted it somewhere.  That’s when I saw all the reports of similar sightings and I came across an article called the ‘UFO Traffic Report’ and it had a link to here to make a report.   I’m a grown man, I know I’m not crazy and I’m not saying this was an Alien UFO but it was like nothing I have ever seen before.;42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897
Bright light in the sky appeared to be a star but was a lot brighter, stayed in the sky even as the sun had risen.;2010-11-18 05:30:00;2.5 hours;Bright light in the sky appeared to be a star but was a lot brighter, stayed in the sky even as the sun had risen. On a mid-level visibility night I woke up and glanced outside to see an extremely bright light up in the south-east sky.  It was around 5 30 or so and the light looked a lot like a star except it was much much brighter than any other stars around. It stuck out right away,  I watched the object for around 2 and a half hours,   The object seemed to be luminating but staying completely still.  As the sun began to rise the circular shaped object did dim because of the suns light, but as all of the other stars had disapeared it remained, same spot luminating.   At about 7 45 when the sun was quite bright u could still see the ball of light.   My father saw it as well and he is not a man easily spooked how ever he even agreed that it wasn't a star or any conventional aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the correct date of the sighting is November 18, and we have altered the date above.  We suspect that the witness may have been looking at a planet, or perhaps a prominent star, and we will recommend that he check the same area of the sky at about the same time of morning.

glowing orbs in the sky;2011-08-18 19:00:00;2 Hours;glowing orbs in the sky Early this week two days prior to the date listed we saw 4 objects in the south sky. 3 made a triangle formation the fourth object was high above the point of the triangle. At first they looked like they were at a standstill until the highest object began to move down toward the triangle and then the others followed but more to the right.  Eventually the objects disappeared.   All objects almost looked as if they were extremely shinny, almost catching a bright glare from the sun, possibly being lit with a light. Two days later we were looking into the north east sky when we saw the same objects again.  These objects started off low in the sky in a large clump then quickly broke off into several individual balls, following behind them two more individual objects.   At first they looked like balloons, but then they began looking like they were too far away to be a balloon, and they also had the bright glare.  As these objects moved toward the east we could see and very small black dot just below a few of them until the objects disappeared into the sky. One hour after we seen these objects we drove west of my house to get a better view on top of a parking structure.  Once here we see another object all by itself, this object moves from the west sky toward the north then back to the west when it appears to slow down and disintegrated into the sky, leaving a short smoke trail.

Facing north when I go out my door I see orange lights that move unlike any man made craft.    They do not start moving till I focused on them.  Then they go like a bat out of hell.   I have seen them a half dozen times in the last few months this is my first time reporting them ..;42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897
