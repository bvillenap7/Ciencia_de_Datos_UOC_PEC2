A spinning lighted low down circle UFO.;2000-01-15 23:00:00;10 minutes;A spinning lighted low down circle UFO. I saw 1 ufo. It was really late at night and there was this small object in the sky. It had multi color flashing lights, and it was moveing right over my house, maybe 3000 feet up. It moved around slightly, then decended down to maybe 1000 feet above my house. The lights were realy big and they were flashing on off on off. The object then began to spin a aproximately 5 miles per hour. This object was huge maybe the size of 3 or four busses across. After hovering for about 10 minuets, the object shot up in a flash.;42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897
Red circle over Kalamazoo.;2013-10-14 20:30:00;5 minutes;red circle over Kalamazoo. I work as a security guard. I was doing a patrol of condos of a senior community when I seen this red round object coming toward me.  I stopped the patrol car and got out and looked up to my right (the passenger side of my car).   When the object which looked like it slowed down, when it was right over me.  There was no sound to it, and it was traveling about 30mph and an altitude of 100 to 150 feet. When it got by me, it picked up speed and started gaining altitude.   All I could see is a red dot, the farther it got, then it just disaopeared;42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897
This is the second sighting of the exact same nature.;2014-05-25 09:00:00;1 minute;This is the second sighting of the exact same nature. Reddish-orange circular object outlined by elo heading north to south.  It was traveling at a decent rate of speed and then slowed down for 20 seconds as it went over our airport here it went vertical and out of sight no more lights.  There was no such thing flashing it was a constant light until it went vertical out of sight.   I called the airport sheriff and he said he saw nothing and gave me the phone number to the tower and nobody at the Tower answer the phone.  This is my second fighting of an object like this.  The first one was the size of a moon and was probably 40 miles away.  The one thing I can't explain and I find interesting is that when I sleep I hear high pitched Morse code in my ears.    I know you said you don't read anything that is a joke or a hoax I know this is crazy to most but the cold in my ears has gone on for years before I started to have sightings.   I would like to know if you have gathered any other information that coincides with this.;42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897

Black spherical/acorn object hovering over Kalamazoo, MI;2017-09-12 19:05:00;23 minutes;Black sphereical/acorn object hovering over Kalamazoo, MI Two or three times a week, I visit East Hall on the campus of Western Michigan University (the old east campus, if you're familiar), an alumni center on a large hill (Prospect Hill) with an outdoor balcony area (facing East) that overlooks the city of Kalamazoo, MI.  On a clear day, you're able to see signage on Sprinkle Road 7 miles away, so I'd say visibility is at least 7-8 miles from the balcony.  It's a great place to watch sunrise, watch the clouds pass, or watch the air traffic over Kalamazoo:  either the helicopters landing at one of the two hospitals or the planes coming into Kalamazoo International Airport, etc.  In other words, East Hall has a great view of the entire city of Kalamazoo and its airspace.  For more info and a photograph of the balcony area of East Hall go to: https://wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Campus_(Western_Michigan_University  7:05 p.m.-7:09p.m. As soon as I walked up to the wall/railing at the edge of the balcony area and looked out (see photographs), I immediately noticed an unusual, featureless, solid black, roughly acorn-shaped/spherical object on the horizon, completely stationary, approx. 1 thumb's width above the tree line, due East of the balcony area.  I'm 5' 8'' tall and from where I was standing, the object appeared to be at eye level with me.  I immediately began taking pictures.  The black object appeared to be hovering, completely stationary, in between Kalamazoo and Battle Creek (26 miles due east of Kalamazoo).  I was not able to gauge the exact distance, but the black object looked to be well outside the city limits of Kalamazoo, possibly as far east as Battle Creek.  (Perhaps it's worth mentioning there's a military base with an airstrip in between Kalamazoo and Battle Creek: Fort Custer)  The stationary, black object clearly and instantly stood out as unusual against the grayish clouds behind it.  I've watched all sorts of air traffic from East Hall for years:  helicopters landing at either hospital, air traffic coming in to Kalamazoo International Airport, hot air balloons, drones more recently, etc.  This didn't look like any air traffic I've ever seen before. 7:09p.m.-7:16p.m. est The black object remained stationary for ~ 4 minutes, before I called a friend in Galesburg, MI, (in between Kalamazoo, MI and Battle Creek, MI, 7 miles due east) and asked her to go outside and scan the horizon.  She didn't notice anything unusual in the sky.  During this time, I began pacing the length of the balcony area to get different vantage points of the object and during this time it very gradually ascended a very short distance (less than a thumb's width) and traveled a very short distance in a northerly direction (moving less than a thumb's width to the left).  Its motion was so subtle that I really wasn't able to see it with my naked eye, rather, repeatedly returning to the spot where I initially spotted the object to judge its progress.  When the black object had finished moving (more or less coinciding with the duration of the call) the object was less than a thumb's width away from where I spotted it initially, having moved very slightly to the north (to the left)! and ascended very slightly.  The object's size did not change during the duration of the sighting. 7:16p.m.-7:23p.m. I ended the call with my friend in Galesburg and began looking for a phone number for the Battle Creek Police Department, eventually finding a number for Calhoun County Sheriff's Department.  The object remained stationary during this time. 7:23p.m.-7:28p.m. I called the Calhoun County Sheriff's Department to see if they were aware of any hot air balloons, large drones, etc. in the air over Battle Creek or the surrounding area.  They were not aware of any.  Almost immediately as I was put on hold to transfer dispatchers, at approx. 7:27p.m. the object began making a very gradual descent dropping straight down, until it dipped below the tree line and completely disappeared from view by 7:29p.m. It's descending! It's descending, I said to no one.  By the time the next dispatcher came on the line, the object had dipped below the trees on the horizon. 7:28p.m.-8:14p.m. I remained at the location of the sighting for almost an hour and the object did not reappear.  During this time, I spoke with you, NUFORC, and made various calls to the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Airport Unit and the Kalamazoo International Airport, in an attempt to check for any balloons, drones, statotinary objects, etc. tracked on radar in the area.  The airport did not immediately return my call and the County Sheriff's Airport Deputy was unaware of any balloons, drones etc. in the area. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness via telephone, and found him to be quite eloquent in his description of the sighting, and serious minded.  We have looked at the photos he has made available to NUFORC, and we see nothing at all in the photos that is discernible as a foreign object.  If an unusual object is visible in any of the photos, it is little more than a small, and extremely vague, smudge.  PD));42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897
4 circular light spinning at a high speed.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly advertising lights??  PD));2019-02-04 03:15:00;15;4 circular light spinning at a high speed. My dog wanted to go outside.  He never goes out at this time of the morning.  I let him out in the back yard.  He usually doesn’t take long but he didn’t come back, so I walked outside and saw 4 round lights spinning in a circular motion over a house in our neighborhood.  I watched them spin for a while, then went back to sit down. 15 minutes later I went back out and they were still ther spinning.  I then went back in. I went back out at 4am and they were not there anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly advertising lights??  PD));42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897
