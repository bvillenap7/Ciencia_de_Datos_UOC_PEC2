A Bright Blue Fireball moving at High Rate of speed, similar to a firework display.;1998-11-01 00:00:00;1min;A Bright Blue Fireball moving at High Rate of speed, similar to a firework display. My friend and I were out very late one night in the local woods.  It was fairly cold and pretty well lit by the moon in the sky, not necessarily full or anything with some very. very high wispy clouds (stratus I believe).  Anyhow, we were leaving the woods at some point between midnight and 2 in the morning (EST).  I remember a bright blue flash that looked like lightning, it lit up everything and refelcted well off of the snow.  We looked to the north to see what looked at first like a bright blue firework (with trails) shooting straight into the air from ground level.  It kept getting higher and higher to the point we both realized it was not a firework.  It got VERY high into the sky and then quickly it turned south at a 90 degree angle and shot across the entire sky.  I should have reported this years ago, but I could not remember exactly when it happened.  This would have been very visible to anyone driving north on US-131. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897

It broke apart or there were other tinyer bits of fire that where around it at first but as it streaked on it became one. Lets put it this way I thought at first we were being Nuked. I stoped got off the steps and watched it till it disapeard at the horizon line. I thought that it was the end of the world. Started to pray..... I have seen UFOs before I have seen Bigfoor! I have never seen anything like this in my life and don't think I will ever again! Wish I could describe this better...... Time: somewere around 7 Pm;42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897
Reddish-orange fireball;2012-09-15 21:14:00;20 seconds;reddish-orange fireball Looking towards the Southeast sky I observed a reddish-orange bright light which I thought was an airplane at first, but it was moving slightly right and left and right again and growing bigger and brighter.  It then appeared to be a fireball, which faded to nothing within a few seconds.  Near Aquarius constellation.;42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897
Massive caravan of a hundred red/orange fireballs moving from west to east at a steady rate in formation for at least ten minutes.;2013-10-11 16:35:00;~10 minutes;Massive caravan of a hundred red/orange fireballs moving from west to east at a steady rate in formation for at least ten minutes. First, I want to say that your second posting guideline is hilarious and probably comes from tens of thousands of terribly typed reports consisting of mostly gibberish.  My sympathies to the people who have to go through these things.  And now for my report... I walked outside at around 8:35pm on 10/11/13 and immediately noticed several red/orange glowing dots in the sky.  I heard a plane flying, so thought nothing of it for a moment but it quickly became apparent that the lights were not planes or helicopters or anything of the sort.  My thoughts went to balloons, either large basket types or the now popular lanterns or whatever.. no, these were flying in formation and moving at a steady rate from WSW to ENE (I'm guessing. They weren't flying exactly W to E, and I'm no pilot sooo...)  What I thought were half a dozen lights turned into dozens and dozens if not a hundred or more as they continued to travel in the same direction in formations of 2 or 3 to as many as 5 or 6. There appeared to be two different types at least based on the size of the glowing orbs in relation to each other.  Too, a couple times I noticed smaller glowing balls of fire shoot out or zoom away from the larger orbs.  The slow moving herd of glowing balls of red/orange light may have had escorts of some kind, because I noticed two or three orbs moving faster than the others by themselves, not part of any of the larger formations.  I don't know for sure when they actually started flying by as I feel I walked in to the halfway point of a massive caravan, but it lasted until nearly 8:43pm.  Tried for pictures and video, but my phone wasn't up to the task. My family also witnessed the event, as did one coworker I texted to make sure he saw the stuff Im always yammering about.  I would be surprised if you weren't flooded with reports of this event and expect it to make the local news.  I feel the sheer volume of craft lumps it in with some of the larger sightings you hear about in Mexico or Arizona.  Dozens and dozens if not a hundred or more.

Hovering fireball type object seen in the southern skies of Kalamazoo on Friday Oct. 10th, 2014 9:15pm;2014-10-10 21:15:00;30 minutes;Hovering fireball type object seen in the southern skies of Kalamazoo on Friday Oct. 10th, 2014 9:15pm Two of us saw what appeared to be a hovering fireball or object round in shape, that was seen in the southern sky south of Kalamazoo, MI. It hovered low in the horizon and did appear to be moving only slightly. It wasn't perfectly still but you could tell it was slightly moving.  I used the term fireball but it could have been a mass of lights, orange/red in color appearing at a distance as a fireball.   I tried to take a pic but it was too far away.  It wasn't a Chinese lantern, but based on the distance and how big it still appeared, it had to have been huge.  I checked Flightradar(iOS app) and there were no flights at all in the area.   After hovering for about 15 mins approx 9:30pm it was gone.   I did check the internet for similar sightings and there have been sightings like this in this area.;42.2684379198712;-85.612441197897
