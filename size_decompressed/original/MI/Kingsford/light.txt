I let my dog out at 1820 that evening and glanced at the stars. I thought I noticed movement to the north looking about  30 degrees up, just over some tall pines nearby. I then noticed two stars traveling west to east, one behind the other,  separated by what appeared to be a mile or more. I  thought it was probably a couple military jets but I did not see any blinking lights so I went in to get my binoculars. Through the binoculars the objects appeared as stars,bright white lights and nothing else. There was no sound  heard after their passing as there normally would be with jets. I got my son to take a look and we watched them disappear. They seemed to fade out or enter high clouds. Lights from the town tend to hamper the view of the sky in the direction they were traveling.;45.8046;-88.0764
Orange light over Kingsford, MI;2008-02-18 19:45:00;5 minutes;Orange light over Kingsford, MI On 2/18/2008 at around 7:45PM I was shoveling snow when I noticed a bright light coming towards me from the SW. I thought it was a small airplane with its landing light on. I would estimate it was 1000-2000 feet in the air and the light was bright orange like that of a city street light. I thought the color was a bit odd for an airplane and I watched it come closer listening for the sound of its engine. I did not hear any sound and it seemed to gain a little altitude. It then slowed to a stop almost overhead and then I thought this can’t be a normal aircraft. I watched it not wanting to miss anything that it might do but I also wanted to film it. I ran to the house to get my video camera and filmed it from our deck. About that time it started to head due south and was the size of a large star. It continued until it faded out over the town of Aurora, WI. I managed to get the object on film but it is VERY shaky.;45.8046;-88.0764
Fast moving light, showed 4 sharp perfectly spaced points of light  through binoculars,;2012-06-29 22:20:00;5 seconds;Fast moving light, showed 4 sharp perfectly spaced points of light  through binoculars, On June 29th, 2012 my wife and I were in our backyard with a small campfire and we noticed that there was a lot of what we call “movers” in the sky among the stars.  After watching the stars for a while, I went to get my binoculars to have a better look at the movers.  At about 22:20 my wife pointed out a very fast mover which looked reddish,  directly above us heading east.  I was able to look at it with the binoculars and saw there were actually 4 sharp, evenly spaced, lights close together on the trailing edge of whatever it was.  It seemed like the back of an extremely fast moving jet but made no sound.  I lost sight of it as it made it's way east.;45.8046;-88.0764
