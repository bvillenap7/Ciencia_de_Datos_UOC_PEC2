I was compelled to look upward above my head and clearly saw a triangular craft travel at high speed overhead me.  The craft made no noise what so ever but it did make me feel drawn towards it.  There were no lights to be seen as it moved from the SE to the NW in the sky at about 100 to 300 ft above me, instead it had something I could only describe as either active camo or a cloaking device that was active as it moved. This effect made it easy to see in the sky as it sped by even in the dark, allowing me to estimate the craft to be similar in size to a B-52 or some similar sized plane or jet but without any features we would recognize today.  I wish I could say 100% that it looked like the so called TR3B but with how fast it was moving I could not get that clearest look at details that would lead me to believe one way or another but it was very similar to say the least. I am part of a very military back-grounded family, including my own time and tour of duty over seas so i am familiar with stealth aircraft in action as well as many other aircraft.  I have even been inside of a B-52 so I remember how large it was, and this triangular craft was similar in scale for sure.  I would love to know what it was I saw last night;45.8046;-88.0764
