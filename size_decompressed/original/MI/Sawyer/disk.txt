Alien Tests Soil.;1990-07-05 17:00:00;3 minutes;Alien Tests Soil I saw an alien and a UFO in Sawyer Michigan in 1990.  I was eight years old.   There is a couple from Chicago who own a little cottage who are barely ever there...probably why the alien chose that spot.  In watching one of the latest episodes, I was astounded to hear of all the other activity right there in South Haven so close to my sighting.   The UFO was hovering right over the cottage spinning really slowly and looked like two dinner plates, one turned upside down on top of the other...it was grey like made of metal...where the plates met there were many different colored lights but when the UFO started spinning faster the colors began to run together..I saw the alien outside of its craft...with an ultrabright light surrounding it...It definitely glowed...It was testing the soil with something that looked like those lights that commonly light walkways up to a person's house only the light from it was neon green...I think it was testing the soil..I ran inside to get my parents and when I returned the alien and the craft were gone...
