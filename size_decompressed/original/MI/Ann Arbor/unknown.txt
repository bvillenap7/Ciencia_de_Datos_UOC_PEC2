I awoke at about 3:00 am to use the washroom and returned to bed, glancing out my south-facing window as usual.  I noticed an unusually bright white light that appeared to be hovering between Orion's Belt and Sirius.  What caught and held my attention were the smaller lights that periodically went on and off in all directions radiating from the bright white light.  At approximately 03:35 an airplane passed across the sky from west to east and it appeared to fly behind the object.   As a geologist,  I mapped the constellations, the airplane's trajectory and the object (as well as the approximate location of the flickering lights in relation to the main, larger white light) so that I could estimate the size of the object if ever I was interested enough to attempt to track down the airplane's distance from my home.   After putting together my scaled figure, I went to bed. This was about at 04:30. ((NUFORC Note:  Celestial body, we suspect, although that is just a guess.  PD));42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
Craft flashing many colors near Ann Arbor, MI;2009-09-14 04:30:00;One Hour +;Craft flashing many colors near Ann Arbor, MI I awoke early, and decided to go for a walk to wake up.  As I saw on my porch drinking coffee, my eye caught what I thought at the time was an airplane in the distance.  I sat watching, waiting for it to disappear from my sight, but it never did. I had observed some flashing lights, but dismissed it for airplane navigation lights.  As I looked closer, I noticed that the lights were not only blue and red, but yellow, green, and white as well.  Needless to say, I became quite intrigued.  It was around this time that I realized that in the 16+ minutes I had been observing the craft, it had not been moving away from me, but rather had stayed in the same spot moving in a circular motion.  After every two and a half or three rotations, the craft would then abruptly move diagonally to the opposite end of the previous circle.  This went on for another ten minuted until it quickly shot forward about fifty meters (rough guess), and repeated the circles.  The way the colors ke! pt changing assured me that it was not an airplane, and the way it moved was unlike anything I have ever seen before in any type of aircraft.

Unusual stationary lights seen at night near Ann Arbor, MI 5-24-2014.;2014-05-24 22:20:00;1.5 minutes;unusual stationary lights seen at night near Ann Arbor, MI 5-24-2014 *Might* have been a helicopter.  BUT lights and movement quite unusual if so:  4 vertical red lights + very bright blue light in the middle and to the right of the red vertical lights, blinking in an ON-pause-ON-OFF repeating pattern, each ON about 1.5 seconds, the pause about 1/10 sec, the OFF about 1/4 sec. Size of lights/craft were roughly size of fingernail on man's pinky finger held at arm's length. Lights/craft were stationary for more than a minute... then object moved horizontally about 1.5 x the width of a man's fist at arms length, then stopped abruptly, then slowly descended to below tree top level over the course of about 10 seconds, when sighting was lost. Lights/craft was approximately 30 degrees elevation from the horizon, viewed in a southeast direction from northeast Ann Arbor, about 120 degrees southeast, measured clockwise from magnetic north. No sound was heard, but could have been masked by nearby highway noise. Movement of lights/craft appeared to be very precise.;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
Object moving erratically in 5-10 degree radial patch of night sky recorded above SE Michigan.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD));2019-01-21 03:00:00;3.5 hours;Object moving erratically in 5-10 degree radial patch of night sky recorded above SE Michigan, other sky objects moved predictably Single small very bright object in the southern sky above southeastern Michigan-–observed and recorded by a scientist moving around a small radial area of the night sky (a 2-dimensional radial area approximately 5-10 degrees in diameter) located about 5 degrees above the horizon.   Moves in an erratic manner not consistent with any known planetary object in motion or manmade aircraft or spacecraft trajectory.  Luminosity consistent with a near atmospheric object.  Movement of the bright object is not a consequence of atmospheric conditions or of intrinsic sensory/motor tremor or micro-movements, as “naturally-occurring” near space manmade satellites or far space stellar objects near this object moved in known, predictable patterns and were also recorded.   Since I do not believe in UFO’s, is this possibly a new class of drone?  (funded by the Defense Advanced Research Agency (DARPA?)).;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
