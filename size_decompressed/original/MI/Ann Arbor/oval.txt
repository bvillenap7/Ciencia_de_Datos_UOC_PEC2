We live in the country, approximately 6 or 7 miles from town so it's pretty dark out here at night.  It was Friday or Saturday, August 11 or 12.  Around 10:00 p.m. I went outside and stood in our driveway and watched the sky for Perseid meteors.  Unfortunately, the moon was shining in the south sky and then a few puffy clouds came in from the north.  However, I was still able to see a few faint meteors and quite a few satellites pass overhead between the patches of clouds.  It was nearly 11:00 pm and I was about to give up and go inside.  Some clouds started to cover the moon and it got a little darker, so thinking that my chances of seeing some meteors would be better, I decided to wait a little longer.  I looked up in the western sky (the big dipper was a little to the right) and saw something move so fast, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me.  I was more or less facing west and looking up to about 60 to 70 degrees above the horizon.  This thing zipped into my line of sight in a straight line from the right (north) to almost directly overhead.  It made an immediate 90-degree change in direction, no delay at all like a billiard ball bouncing off the side of a pool-table, and then zipped to the east and disappeared in the clouds.  The sighting lasted only 2 seconds!  It was oval shaped and flat not shiny, and dark gray. There were no lights or sound.  It was nearly the same color as the dark gray clouds against the black sky.  I think it was above the clouds.  And it was huge.  It was the size of my thumbnail held at arm's length! I didn't see it approach from the horizon.  It just came out of nowhere all of a sudden and then disappeared.  I;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
