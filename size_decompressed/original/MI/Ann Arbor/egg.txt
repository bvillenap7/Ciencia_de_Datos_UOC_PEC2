Translucent egg-shaped balloon like object in early morning sky in Ann Arbor, MI.;2001-06-27 07:05:00;10 minutes;Translucent egg-shaped balloon like object in early morning sky in Ann Arbor, MI. I was driving along Scio Church Road between Parker and Wagner Roads in the early morning with my 11 year old daughter.   The sun was shining and the sky was blue.   We were headed east.     My daughter says, Look at that hot air balloon without the balloon.    I looked and saw a translucent egg-shaped bubble with a smaller dark ball above it up in the sky about a mile or so to the northeast of us - about as high up as we usually see hot air balloons.    I pulled off the road to get a better look.     It was very strange.   I couldn't tell how it was staying up in the air - there were not propellors or any other apparent source keeping it up.    It looked like a silvery white balloon and it almost looked like two human shapes were moving around inside of it.    The shape was just about the size for the 2 shapes to be in.    It appeared to hang in one place and drifted side to side from the top just very slightly.     I did not have any binoculars unfortunately.    When we turned onto Wagner Road headed north, we couldn't see it anymore.   It was almost like the sun had been shining through it to make it visible to us.     We both thought it was very strange and probably a UFO.    The people we told thought we were nuts.;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
Green Egg gives air show in South Central Michigan;2019-08-19 05:00:00;3-5 seconds;Green Egg gives air show in South Central Michigan As I drove south on Hwy 23 in Michigan I looked to the Left (East) at what I thought was the constellation Orion.  Then this Bright glowing green egg just seamed to raise for the ground and moved from the south to the north, it made a dip and a rise and arched Downward again leaving some kind of a trail behind it.  At the bottom of the second dip, it rolled over to the right and shot off at a approx 100-110 degree angle disappearing in a flash. this was no more than 200 yards from me.;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
