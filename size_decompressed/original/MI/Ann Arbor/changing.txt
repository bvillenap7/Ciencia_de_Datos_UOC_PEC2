Probable HOAX:  5 ufos, silent black objects, moving slowly;2006-01-02 00:00:00;5 mins;5 ufos, silent black objects, moving slowly at first we saw six light reflecting off the clouds. The six lights were grouped into pairs, which at first, traveled together but then moved about eachother in random movements.  they were traveling from east to west.  One of the lights slowly began to fade away as if it were disappearing into the clouds.  Another set followed and eventually the last pair disappeared over our building.  all were silent, and no actual object was seen, only lights.  At that time I looked back to the east and notice a silent black object moving slowly just below the clouds.  Above this craft you cloud see a round light reflecting off the clouds.  at one point it appeared to stop and hover, but it eventually began to move on slowly. Again I looked to the east and seen a larger black object with the same reflecting light above, moving slowly. As we watched both, the first eventually disappeared on the over our roof, and the larger second followed. ((NUFORC Note:  Probable hoax.
