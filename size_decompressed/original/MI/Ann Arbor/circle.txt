UFO siting in Ann Arbor MI,;2007-10-04 18:45:00;15 Seconds;UFO siting in Ann Arbor MI, I was out near a park with my co-worker flying his RC Plane. He had a videobox recording that was receiving a wireless signal from the camera he mounted in his fuselage. He asked me to be a spotter while he flown the plane via 3rd person perspective his 3 inch screen hooked up to the receiver.  He the plane was directly overhead, I noticed a perfectly round shape that was hovering above us.  It looked like a donut because it appeared to have two circles in each other. (A small circle in a larger circle)  The color was tan or orange and dull and was moving slowly and then disappeared. I believe it was going upwards maybe.  I could not tell if it disappeared or went up out of site.  I rubbed my eyes thinking I was seeing sun spots because of the time of day, but sure enough it was still there directly above us.  I was too flabbergasted to say anything to my friend because he was flying his plane and I did not want to distract him.  Nor did I want to be ridiculed or laughed at.  I guess I did not know how to deal with this situation.;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
