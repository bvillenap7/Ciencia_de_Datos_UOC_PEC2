Ufo in long cloud moving through sky;1977-07-15 00:00:00;Half an hour;Ufo in long cloud moving through sky I was walking back from getting pizza at Domino's at the Georgetown mall around 11:30 on a crystal clear summer night.  You could see in the sky forever as the sky was very clear and it was rather bright that night with the long days of July.  We saw what we thought was a tornado in the sky approaching our homes.  It was enormous.  It was wide at the top and then trailed off to a skinny tail.  We ran home and I announced to my brother and father that there was a tornado coming and we have to take shelter.  Neither one of them moved an inch.  They said the sky was clear and no warning on TV for tornados.  They just did nothing.  I ran to my friends house and he was out back on the porch with his sister as I recall starting at this weird cloud moving through the sky.  It was not a tornado.  It was a cloud I can best describe as a snake or caterpillar.  It has a beginning and an end and was the same thickness throughout.  We we first saw it I guess it was like looking at train tracks with them wide up close then barrow in the distance and that is why we thought it was a tornado.  I watched close and saw a craft moving inside the cloud as it made it's way across the sky.  It was higher up then before I would say and was directly in front of us now.  I wanted to get a closer look.  I ran home and grabbed my brother's telescope. I set it up on my friends porch and tried to look at the craft.  I could not get a fix on it with the high power scope.  I looked through the smaller spotting scope attached to it and got a clear view of the cloud and the craft.  It looked like the cloud was leading and concealing the craft.  The craft flew very strangely.  I can best describe it as a how a moth flies.  All different directions, but making forward progress.  It never left the cloud area and was about in the middle of the snake body of the cloud.  It bounced around rapidly like a pin ball.  It had lights of three colors that were blinking.  All of the sudden, it was a! s if it knew I had an clear view of everything, and this is the most fascinating part to me, the cloud made a very sharp ninerg degree turn away from me.  It was like the cloud was in a tube.  The snake like cloud followed right along the path of the head and the ship did the same.  It was pretty high in the sky now.  I watched and watched as it slowly made it's was away from me and was no longer easy to see. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Triangular shaped object seen on Aug, 19, 2004 near Ann Arbor, MI;2004-08-19 22:00:00;5 minutes;Triangular shaped object seen on Aug, 19, 2004 near Ann Arbor, MI On Thursday, August 19, 2004 at around 10:00 p.m. I was driving home from a late dinner with colleagues. I was driving westbound on M-14, an expressway in Southeastern Michigan. I have driven this expressway for the last 20 years (I am a serial commuter) and I know it like the back of my hand. It was dark out and as I rounded a corner I noticed a large, bright object just over the trees up ahead of me. As I got closer, I noticed that the light came from three large circles with a flashing orange circle in the middle. They were in a triangular pattern. The light was an extremely white, very intense light. I was the only car on the westbound side of the expressway so I slowed way down to around 10-15 mph, almost to a stop. The object was about 200 feet in the air, just past the Gotfredson Road exit (going westbound), on the south side and about 50 yards off the expressway. At first I couldn’t see the structure that the circles of light were attached to but as I got closer and was more directly under it, I noticed that the lights were attached to a triangular shaped object. The only way I saw the structure was because it was slightly darker than the night sky. It had some depth but probably wasn’t more than 30 feet deep. I thought it was odd that the lights did not throw any reflection up to the structure. The lights had no reflective properties at all. Even the ground below was not lit up by any light. With as bright as these lights were and how close it was to the ground, I couldn’t understand why nothing was lit up. This thing was large. It was the size of a 747 or so, if a 747 could be triangular. The ends of the triangle were blunted, they were not sharp. The object made no noise. This particular section of the expressway has no development and is surrounded by crop fields and stands of woods. There is no lighting or large buildings. When I slowed down to a crawl, I noticed that this thing was staying stock-still and was making no noise. None. I watched the object for about two more minutes. It never moved. The only motion was the orange light blinking in the middle of the three white lights.;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
Object was black and triangular with white lights on each corner;2008-06-30 22:40:00;2 minutes;Driving down Maple Rd. south before Textile Rd.

Two black triangular craft seen hovering over Ann Arbor airport.;2008-07-20 21:35:00;5 minutes;Two black triangular craft seen hovering over Ann Arbor airport.  They were sighted from Maple Rd. just north of Textile road.  They were not heading anywhere. They were hovering.  It was still pretty light out and this being second time spotting them in this area.  One had red and blue blinking lights like a plane but it was obvious that it was not a plane and the other one had just the three white lights.;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
Triangular UFO Seen Over Downtown Ann Arbor;2011-03-27 11:15:00;30 seconds;Triangular UFO Seen Over Downtown Ann Arbor At 11:15, a friend and I we’re in the alley behind work, having a cigarette. The sighting took place in downtown Ann Arbor.  My friend looked up and exclaimed, “What the **** is that?”   He pointed directly upwards to a triangular object who’s three points were each designated by a soft, blue light.  The object seemed not to cruise a regular speed, but to sort of float and pivot slightly back and forth, headed in a general northwest direction.  The object itself was barely discernible, except the back looked slightly concaved, or fish-tailed.  We saw the object floating for about 15 seconds before it disappeared behind the buildings in the city.;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
A triangular shaped craft containing one lit circle at each vertex was spotted flying over a park just after midnight.;2013-06-16 00:23:00;5 seconds;A triangular shaped craft containing one lit circle at each vertex was spotted flying over a park just after midnight. My lover and I were watching a movie in the park (at least 100 other viewers were in attendance) and a triangular shaped object with a lit circle at each vertex appeared to float over the crowd before disappearing behind a building.   The object was seen in flight for about five seconds.;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
Three bright white lights across the front of one single vehicle.;2014-02-02 21:30:00;30 seconds;Three bright white lights across the front of one single vehicle. It was a clear night.  There were 3 bright white lights straight across.  I could not make out a shape, so I have guessed that it was triangular.   The craft was at about 1000 feet altitude, traveling south to north at the speed of a typical helicopter.  Very little sound.   My initial guess was a B-2 Stealth bomber, but I have seen them before and they are very loud once they pass you.  This was not.

Observed 3 bright white lights in a equilateral triangular shape, pass directly and silently overhead, at a high rate of speed.;2017-06-09 23:30:00;<15 seconds;Observed 3 bright white lights in a equilateral triangular shape, pass directly and silently overhead, at a high rate of speed. On the night of June 9th, 2017 at around 11:30 PM,  I observed 3 bright white lights in a equilateral triangular shape, pass directly and silently overhead, and travel in straight line toward the South East at a very high rate of speed until out of sight. I was home and in bed when one of the dogs decided he needed to go outside, so I got up and took him out to the back yard. The sky was clear and so I paused to gaze at the stars.  I usually hope to see a meteor or a satellite drift by.  But that night, I looked straight up and immediately saw a very bright light moving what seemed to be just above a 60' tree behind me.  I wasn’t sure what it was, but as I watched, 3 lights in the shape of an equilateral triangle slowly came into full view directly above me. The lights were bright, white, and steady (not strobes), however, they seemed to have a shimmering, star-like quality to them.  My first thought was that someone was flying a drone over our house, but it seemed odd, since I’ve never seen any drones flying in our neighborhood, and it was a bit late at night. The second thing I noticed was the absence of any sound — it was totally silent.  I remember thinking that it all seemed very odd, and if a drone was flying possibly only 100 feet above me, I would have easily heard the buzzing sound of the motors/rotors. Watching it, I felt a sense of awe although it was also slightly disorienting since it was hard to tell exactly how large the formation was, or what the true elevation was.  They seemed to be moving very fast, maintaining a uniform triangular formation, and moved at a consistent speed in a straight South-Easterly direction over the house and yard.  It took less than 15 seconds until they were out of sight — which would be several miles away. I live outside the city lights in a dark suburban area, on top of a hill so I can see well above the tree line to the South.  I had a clear view of the lights during the entire observation, they didn’t disappear behind trees or clouds and I watched them as far as the eye can see.  I’ve observed balloons, meteors, satellites, jets, helicopters and small airplanes, but this triangle of lights was unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Finally, about 4 days after my observation, I mentioned this to a friend who also lives in the neighborhood.  He remarked that around that time, he and his wife were out for a walk when a bright light went overhead (his first thought was that it was drone) followed by other lights that seemed to come from the side and “join up” with the lead lights. They said they looked like bright stars, but they moved very quickly through the sky as a group. About one month later, I asked him if he could remember exactly when and what he saw.  His response shocked me.  He said he would “check his phone” to look at the “date on the photos”.  Turns out he has about 7 photos and a very short (3 second) video.  I’ve reviewed the photos, and they show at least 2 groups of triangular lights, and perhaps a 3rd or 4th group further in the distance.  My friend prefers to remain anonymous, so unfortunately, I can’t attach the photos/video. I’ve never witnessed anything like this, and felt the need to report it.  Any help in understanding what was seen here would be greatly appreciated.  By the way, my friend and I are both employed as software developers.;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
