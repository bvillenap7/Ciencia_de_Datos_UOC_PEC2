It was dusk when the two of us were driving down the street.  I noticed the object in the sky and said, what is that? We pulled into a parking lot and observed the object for awhile.  It was very large and was goldish in color.  The edges were not smooth, but kind of jagged-almost like a sand dollar.  There were marks on the outside of the top of the object.  It was completely soundless and was bobbing up and down at the sides very much like a gigantic balloon.  As we watched the vehicle slowly moved westwardly and higher in the sky.  We got back in our car and breifly followed it, but it dissappeared into the distance. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
