Large object, slow moving, very large near Packard St. in Ypsilanti MI.;2003-09-24 11:30:00;10 minutes;Large object, slow moving, very large near Packard St. in Ypsilanti MI. 9/24/03 approximately 11.30 AM.  I had just dropped my girlfriend off at work in Ann Arbor and was heading back to our apartment in southern Ann Arbor. I was driving East on Packard St, towards Ypsilanti. Just after crossing Carpenter road, I saw a large object in the sky, just above the treeline. At first I thought it was a blimp, but when I took a second look at it, it seemed to have corners along the edges rather than a smooth curving surface of a blimp. Curious about what it was I decided to try to follow it.  Basically, describe its physical appearance, it was dark, but it was far away so I cannot describe it as any more than a silhouette. Its size was about as long as a quarter held at arms lenght, but it was very far away, maybe a mile, but I am not very good at estimating distance. It seemed rounghly rectangular or hexagonally shaped, being maybe four times longer than it was tall. Its first appearence made me think Blimp but once again, the outline had corners and it seemed a bit too large and skinny.  As I headed south on Packard, the object seemed to be vertically positioned just above the treeline. It was much farther away than the treeline as it would move slightly and sometimes be partially occluded by the trees. It also seemed to move slightly South and East. As I got closer, it seemed to become more occluded by the trees so I decided to turn South on Hewitt Rd. The object  continued to become more and more occluded by the trees. Soon, it dipped below the treeline and I was no longer able to see it and by the time I reached Ellsworth, I had lost it.  I am not sure what it was. It was too slow and too big to be an airplane, and its shape didn't seem right to be a blimp. I rarely see blimps in this area anyway, except during football games, which was not today.  I will email a drawing of the object.;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
This was a bright, vertical, elliptically shaped “contrail” that didn’t move or dissipate. There was no visible craft in front of it.
