Four college students (University of Michigan)were on the top of the med school parking structure looking for the comet that was supposed to be visible.Instead, we all saw a red/orange flashing light streak across the entire visible sky in about 2 seconds, andthen make a 90 degree left turn.  It then flew for another couple seconds and then disappeared.  We allsaw exactly the same occurrance.;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
My first impression was that I was looking at 2 commercial jet airliners moving together, side by side with their spotlights on.  When ;2000-03-27 18:00:00;15 seconds;My first impression was that I was looking at 2 commercial jet airliners moving together, side by side with their spotlights on.  When the 2 lights were almost overhead, the light on the left turned off.  The bright light on the right continued on about 5 more seconds, and then it went out and the running lights came on.  There was enough daylight for me to see that where the light on the right had been was a plane.  But where the left light had been was nothing. We live about 12 miles west of the municipal airport, so we see a lot of air traffic.  A lot of the planes that I see flying over from east to west are displaying their bright white spotlights, and then it seems like once they reach altitude their spotlight goes out and then you see their blinking running lights it's pretty obvious that it's a plane.  Something in the sky caught my attention in the early evening a few weeks ago, and I looked up and saw a pair of very bright white lights, coming from the east and moving together to the west.  There was a short distance between them and I felt sure that I was looking at two separate objects.  My first impression was that I was looking at 2 commercial jet airliners moving together, side by side with their spotlights on.  Their speed was not unlike other planes I see flying in the area however, I don't often see 2 planes flying side by side like this.  So I continued to watch them.  When the 2 lights were almost overhead, the light on the left turned off  like a big stadium light when it's turned off, it sort of faded out.  I expected then to see the blinking running lights turn on, but they didn't.  In fact, I didn't see any structure or lights in that space at all.  The bright light on the right continued on about 5 more seconds, and then it went out and the running lights came on.  There was enough daylight for me to see that where the light on the right had been was a plane.  But where the left light had been was nothing.  It was like this thing on the left was flying with the plane and then just disappeared.  There were no other planes nearby.  I was puzzled and wondered where the 'thing on the left' went, but I figured there must have been something there that I missed.  Problem is, I haven't been able to forget about it.;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
three red glowing balls following eachother like follow the leader in the night sky.;2000-11-04 19:30:00;i dont know what that mea;three red glowing balls following eachother like follow the leader in the night sky. it was about seven thirty when me and my two friends were by cherry pond and suddenly we saw threee red dots come out from tree tops, they followed eachother perfectly they looked to be red and fast then suddenly they when diaganal and then sort of leveled out, but this cocould of been a plane but not like we saw it. it was really much of light but also an oval egg shaped too. also the red balls stayed together sort of like follow the leader. It could have been three different ships, or one big one with three big red lights seperate from eachother. ((NUFORC Note:  Three students submit this report jointly.

TWO RED-ORANGE LIGHTS  IN FORMATION OVER ANN ARBOR, MI.;2005-09-04 21:00:00;5 seconds;TWO RED-ORANGE LIGHTS  IN FORMATION OVER ANN ARBOR, MI. I've seen things like this before, but never there.  My Cousin and I were fishing on the Huron river and I was admiring the evening sky.  I saw what I thought to be a satelite, very dim, red-orange, moving slowly at high altitude, almost exactly from west to east.   Aprox. two seconds after I first noticed the satelite, another appeared next to the first. The second one was the same color as the first, only slightly dimmer.  Almost as soon as the second object appeared, it encircled the first, one time in a counter-clockwise direction,  and then the two objects split up.  The first, having changed it's course only slightly, continued in an easterly direction.  The second bolted south and disappeared.  The two objects seemed to be at their brightest when they first appeared toghether, then got dimmer from then. I watched the first object moving east, until it was too dim to see.  This whole event took less than five or six seconds, so my Cousin didn't get a chance to look up in time. However, we both noticed five aircraft, also at pretty high altitude,(too high up to hear), flying fairly close together, following the same flight path the first object took. When I say fairly close, I don't mean in formation, but they were too close to be commercial aircraft. The aircraft flew by about one minute after i lost sight of the first object.(following perhaps?);42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
suspected ufo over Ann Arbor;2008-02-27 06:32:00;2 minutes;suspected ufo over Ann Arbor I was out walking my dog when I saw a bright white light traveling west southwest over Ann Arbor. It was traveling a good deal faster than air traffic over here does, and I noted that there were no flashing red or green lights. So I watched it. As I watched it executed an instantaneously abrupt 30 degree right turn. A few seconds later it repeated the maneuver, and was headed west toward Jackson. It then slowed to a near stop for a second, and then resumed course and speed. Aircraft flying over here do not maneuver like that, they come in on a heading and leave on a heading which is maintained. Moreover, they are not capable of such abrupt maneuveurs.;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
Brightest lights moving in the weirdest patterns with a lot of plane and satellite activity around it.;2011-03-30 23:30:00;1 hr;Brightest lights moving in the weirdest patterns with a lot of plane and satellite activity around it. I was driving home from dinner on a back road with my girlfriend when we saw the weirdest thing.  The brightest LED like light was flashing over the western horizon.  Then the flash turned into 3 flashes, each at the same time about a mile apart for one flash, and then back to the same 2 second pattern of one light flashing.   We both felt chills down our spines as we watched this spectacular event.  There was no way this was a airplane. I have never seen lights this bright, and it would move like lightning.  We parked the car at a field and watched this amazing event.  We then noticed a abundance of what seemed to be planes or satellites bunching around the lights.   We left the scene because it was cold out and we were freaked out.;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
Weird orange lights over Ann Arbor.;2013-07-19 22:20:00;10 minutes;Weird orange lights over Ann Arbor. My wife and I saw 20-25 orange lights, flying or floating from Southwest to Northeast, in single formation, and at low altitude.   The lights weren't blinking like aircraft, and they were passing beneath the sporadic cloud cover.   During the event, we could see jet airliners flying above these weird orange lights at much higher altitudes.   These objects didn't make any kind of sound as they passed over.

Extremely bright light, not moving.  Situated just at the cloud cover line in the eastern sky.  Darted up through the clouds.;2013-11-01 07:30:00;10 seconds;Extremely bright light, not moving.  Situated just at the cloud cover line in the eastern sky.  Darted up through the clouds. I was driving to Pioneer High School with my daughter.  As we turned from 7th St. onto Stadium Blvd. the light was visible just under the cloud cover, in the eastern sky (slightly southeast).  It was extremely bright and at first I thought it was a meteor.  However, it did not move.  Just as I was about to point it out to my daughter I saw it move slightly upward and shoot into the clouds, disappearing very rapidly.  My daughter had seen the whole thing too.  She then told me that several nights prior she and three friends had seen two of these, moving synchronously before disappearing.;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
Low flying, stationary pulsating white light near S. 7th St and Princeton Ave, Ann Arbor.;2014-10-01 22:00:00;2 minutes;Low flying, stationary pulsating white light near S. 7th St and Princeton Ave, Ann Arbor. This event occurred on a cloudy night in Ann Arbor on South 7th Street, close to the intersection of Princeton Avenue.   Walking home from work sometime approximately during fall of 2014, while talking on the phone, I looked up and noticed a large white blinking light, very nearly directly overhead, slightly towards the northwest.  I am not certain of the altitude of the light, but it could not have been more than a few hundred feet in the air, based on my perception of it being close, and since the cloud cover was relatively low (I could see no planes, stars, etc., and the clouds seemed to pass around the light occasionally).   As I watched the light it did not appear to move, but remained in one place.  The light was a bright white/yellow and pulsated from completely bright to completely dark about once a second.  I watched the light for about 2 minutes and relayed the strangeness of it to the person on the phone.   After about 2-3 minutes of spectating, the light either turned off or was engulfed by the clouds.   I did not identify any sound coming from the light.   I waited another 5 minutes before leaving the area and did not see anything more.;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
Several white lights seen hovering/flying around one another, miles at distance towards WSW from Ann Arbor-Saline Rd/W. Ellsworth Rd.;2015-01-15 16:00:00;20 minutes;Several white lights seen hovering/flying around one another, miles at distance towards WSW from Ann Arbor-Saline Rd/W. Ellsworth Rd. This event occurred sometime after the new year, either in January or early February of 2015, close to dusk.  I observed this event while traveling southwest on Ann Arbor-Saline Rd and looking towards west-southwest.  When I first noticed the event I was crossing over I-94 and continued down the road until I reached West Ellsworth Road, where I pulled into the parking lot of First Unitarian Universalist church to observe.  I witnessed this event for about 20 minutes, part of the time on the phone and relaying what I was seeing to a friend. As usual in Ann Arbor, it was a cloudy day. Cloud cover was high and intermittent, with large cumulus clouds miles in the distance in the direction I was looking.  While driving, I noticed 3 or 4 lights several miles towards the west-southwest.  At first I thought they were planes since there are airports nearby, but as I continued to watch I noticed that the lights were moving around one another, up and down, left and right, and continuously crossing paths.  The lights were white, solid, and did not blink or pulsate.  Their speed of movement was not particularly remarkable.  After a few minutes two more lights emerged from the clouds (cumulus clouds were a backdrop for this event) and some of these lights would circle others, or move back and forth, while some would stay still.  Occasionally, one light would fade away (into the clouds?) and another light would appear nearby.  I watched these lights, which stayed generally in the same area of the sky during this time, until one by one they faded away and were no longer visible.  I do not know if what I witnessed was planes or similar aircraft flying in some formation, or if these were truly UFO/UAP.  It is important to note that during this event I did see several planes in the sky with their familiar blinking lights, however they, for the most part, moved uni-directionly and most planes would appear and disappear comparatively swiftly to the lights.;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
Pulsing bright light near sundown.  ((anonymous report));2016-08-22 20:27:00;15 minutes;Pulsing bright light near sundown. I was out for a run and not iced a very bright light in the sky near sundown. There were 2 airplanes in my frame of view and they were noticeably dimmer and had condensation trails, where the object I am describing was stationary and pulsed its light off then on with a frequency of about 3-4 minutes and an off time of roughly a minute.   I watched the light strobe 3 times and then it turned off for at least 5 minutes before I went indoors. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Two red glowing lights, moving slowly southeastward, looking from central Ann Arbor.;2016-08-22 22:30:00;5 minutes;Two red glowing lights, moving slowly southeastward, looking from central Ann Arbor. While biking home tonight I came to the intersection of Hill Street and South Division St., I stopped to check my phone for messages, when I looked up and noticed two red glowing lights in the sky off towards the southeastern horizon.  At first I thought they were planes, but I quickly realized that they were an unusual solid red color, unlike a plane with blinking lights.  I observed the two red lights as they slowly moved further towards the southeast until they vanished, one after the other, into the clouds.   I could not tell at what elevation they were flying, only that they seemed to be generally at the same elevation as the planes flying nearby.  They moved markedly slower than all of the obvious planes flying nearby, and the lights kept the exact same distance from one another throughout my observation. I took a photo using my cellphone camera which shows the two lights clearly, however it does not show the red color I observed with my eyes and there is little detail to the lights.  Notably, the airplanes that were also in the sky in the view of my camera did not show up on my camera, as I assume they were not bright enough to be captured.  Please let me know if you would like this photo.;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602

Everything got very quiet (we had the car radio on and it got very static and then totally quiet, car was still running though) and the light filled the sky for between 5-10 full seconds.  It pulsed a little bit halfway through.  Then, everything went back to normal.  Everyone with us was amazed, and everyone agreed that it did not look like lightening.  Not to mention lightening and thunderstorms during the winter in Michigan are very rare.   The light was also a bit green.;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
