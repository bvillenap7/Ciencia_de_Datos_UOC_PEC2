What were they?  I don't know...could've been anything...possibly military, but I don't know... I've always thought there was something to all these sightings...there are too many people seeing too many things to be just written off as mistaken identy, or others...I'm just not so sure...wish I'd have my cam-corder (which I now carry in my cab wherever I go)...;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
Observed 3 objects flying in a tri-angular (or V) shaped pattern...

I pulled my car over and got out of car to watch them pass...appeared at first to be hot-air balloons...but as it was 10:30 PM, thought that to be unlikely...nearly passed directly over me...passed from due west to due east...had very bright light on front and alternating red/white lights on rear...seemed to be travelling at about 100-200 ft, at about 50 or so kts...hard to tell..didn't have anything to guage their size with...watched objects for 45 minutes...no sound heard...after losing sight of objects, I contacted my dispatcher who I asked to Step out of the office, turn to the north, and look up...which he did just as they passed over...afterward went to payphone to call 911 and tell officials about objects and direction of travel...member of ham radio skywarn group...also contacted media (an all news radio station WWJ, and local TV station <WDIV>...while both were cordial, when I asked 911 operator if anyone else had contacted them, I was told that they couln't tell me at that time...but did talk to Mich State Trooper who told me, while being too far away to see himself, others were observing and following ...(I wondered what they would do if they were to catch them???)... Nothing appeared locally in the media...did see newspapers from Flint and Grand Rapids the following day have story on front pages...also, was told by two Huron Valley Ambulance attandents they had also seen the ojects... So what do I think they were?...Who knows...I just know what I saw ... I try to carry a palm corder around with me, and a scanner with a tape recorder...just in case...;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
Grey hourglass-like shaped object hovering, then disappeared behind clouds.;2011-09-23 18:55:00;5 seconds;Grey hourglass-like shaped object hovering, then disappeared behind clouds. I was driving north on State Street in Ann Arbor Michigan, about to turn left onto Textile Road, and I saw a large grey object about 3-5 miles away, maybe 15-25 degrees from the horizon. The object was long (maybe several hundered meters) and somewhat narrow, but with a series of bulges, with one prominent bulge just high of the middle of the object which was perpendicular to the ground (lengthwise).  The object could have been some sort of balloon, but I have never seen any sort of ballon like it.;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
