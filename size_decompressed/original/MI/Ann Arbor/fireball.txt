Falling white light made u turn and disappeared.;1996-09-18 00:20:00;5 sec.;Falling white light made u turn and disappeared. I was driving North on U.S. 23 just past the Geddes Rd. exit. I saw something out of the corner of my eye to the North West. I thought it was a falling star. It was coming down fast at a slight angle when suddenly it turned and made a U turn and disappeared. From the time I looked at it, it made a J shape making a perfect 180 degree turn and disapearing after going back up about half the distance that I seen it coming down. After I saw it, I realized it didn't have a tale like a normal falling star. It was a bright ball of white light. There was a red ford ranger in front of me and the driver slowed down and was looking up in the same direction as I was, so he must have seen it too. I wanted to report it, but didn't know how until now. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate it, but the date may be approximate.  PD));42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
Numerous fast moving, large red lights in Northern sky at night;2012-06-08 23:00:00;1 hour;Numerous fast moving, large red lights in Northern sky at night In the northern sky for about an hour, we saw countless red fireballs, though only a maximum of 3 appeared at a time, cross the sky.  They moved extremely fast, so that excludes the possibility that they may have been Chinese lanterns.  There were three other eyewitnesses other than myself.;42.2780656108596;-83.7357395927602
