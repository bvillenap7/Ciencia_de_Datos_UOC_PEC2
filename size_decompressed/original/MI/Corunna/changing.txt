large, flat black with grid lines and port holes soundless craft;1998-10-20 11:30:00;one min.;large, flat black with grid lines and port holes soundless craft I was driveing home one day and came around a curve, looked up and thought I had seen a hot air baloon. The only problem was it was a nasty low cloud windy day. There were some trees in the way so I speeded up to get a better look and when I did I couldent belive what it was I saw. This craft was large, sort of grayish black colored and appeared to have grid lines like graph paper on it along with port holes along the middle. It dropped down from the dark cloud bank and I could see the turbulance it was causing in the cloud. The thing seemed to change shape and was moveing fast but not faster then a  jet air liner. I couldent understand why it was so soundless. After it crossed in front of me I floored my car  so I could see it go away. Well the thing was now moveing directly away from me and it looked very thin as all I could see was a vertical line now. Man I was so excited to get home because it looked like it went right over my house but when I got there no one was home. Well my pulled in about a min later and I was pissed that she dident see it and my son started laughing at me. I thought there would be some thing on the news but nothing was said. I know at least two other people saw it but they were gone when I turned back to where I first saw it.;43.0416;-84.0295
