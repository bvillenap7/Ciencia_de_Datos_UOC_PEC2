They did not move, and three disappeared.  Then 30 seconds later the lone one took off at a 45 degree angle and climbed till it was out of sight.   Higher than anything I have ever seen before in about six seconds.  All four were a bright orange and red and no blinking lights.   They also did not make any jet or sonic sounds.;43.0416;-84.0295
