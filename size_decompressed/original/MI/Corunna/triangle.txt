Looking east out of the patio door just over the field we spotted bright lights low on the horizon and it appeared to be heading towards us. As the lights moved closer you could make out that the craft had 3 large, round, very bright (non-flashing) white lights on the underside that formed a triangle. The craft was VERY silent, flying low and moving at a slow pace across the moonless sky. We went out in the backyard to get a better look as it flew just about directly overhead. We were able to see only a slight outline of the craft due to the lights shining so bright. We lost sight of the craft as it headed southwest in the general direction of Lansing.;43.0416;-84.0295
