Bright light hoovering over the night sky, getting dim and bright at different times.;2010-08-14 00:30:00;30min;Bright light hoovering over the night sky, getting dim and bright at different times. It was about 12:30am my brother called me and asked me to check something in the sky... it was a bright light that kept hovering up and down and side to side, at a different point it had another light that was deemer and moved.  Then the small light was gone but the other light was still doing the same thing.  My brother turned the light on from our house and then the light would get dim and as soon as we turned the light off it would be bright.  Dont know how long it was because I got tired and went to bed.;43.3393;-85.8318
