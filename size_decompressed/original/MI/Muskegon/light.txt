White orb of light, impossible motions, and rates of speed.;2013-06-18 00:00:00;45 seconds;White orb of light, impossible motions, and rates of speed. This is an experience that took place over a period of probably 2 weeks, and on three separate nights. Starting off with only myself as a witness, and on the last occasion, including my Fiance in the sighting. On the first night of this experience, I was alone outside my home enjoying a cigarette. Gazing at the night sky as I always do, partly because I love outer space, and partly because this is definitely not my first experience with UFO's.  Nothing was unusual when I ended my smoke, and went inside to the kitchen for a snack.  I got what I needed, and began to head downstairs to my living room to watch TV, or just relax.  The door to outside my home, is at the top of my staircase and I looked out the window as I was headed passed.. and saw a light in the sky, like a dominant star, that surely wasn't present when I was outside just moments before.  So I stopped for a harder look, and noticed it was moving slightly..  Then it stopped. I had a strange feeling wash over me, as if this thing could see me...  So I slung open the door, triggering my motion sensor porch light, and I stepped outside.  At this very moment, it picked up moving slowly again, than accelerated at an indescribable rate.  I took a &quotU&quot shaped, arched path,  Straight out of the Earths atmosphere, and it was gone!  I told my Fiance about this experience that very night, when I joined her in bed for slumber, and we went on with our lives.  About a week and half later, her and I were having a bit of a disagreement late at night.  So I decided to just go for a walk, and cool off. I sat at a park, on a swing set at a local nearby elementary school for, a good hour.  Smoking a few cigarettes, and reflecting on the situation at hand, and how to handle it upon returning home to my Fiance.  I was looking at the sky, and stars for this entire hour or so, seeing nothing unusual. I got up and started walking home, eventually turning the corner to the road I reside on. I glanced into the sky, in the same direction I first witnessed the ball of light, and much to my surprise, THERE IT WAS! It acted in the almost exact same manner as it did the first occasion, moving very slowly.  I took it upon myself to wave my arms in the air, because again, I had the feeling this thing could see me, for whatever reas! on.... And when I waved my arms... it again accelerated at an unearthly rate, and left the earths atmosphere!  I once again, returned home, and explained to my Fiance that I had damn near the same experience as I had a week or so prior.  This time it was a little bit deeper conversation, as I obviously was a bit more shaken up. I described it to her in high detail, from it just being a white orb of light, to its flight path out of the atmosphere, and out of sight... And we once again, simply returned to our everyday life.  The very next night, at about 11:00pm, we decided it was a nice night for a mutual walk. We went to the same park, at the same school, I visited the night before alone. We sat on the same exact swing set, and talked for a while. Then decided to head home. We together turned the corner to my house... and I looked again, where I had seen it the first two occasions for shits and giggles.. and I could not believe my eyes when it was actually there again.. I stopped dead in my chances and said, excuse my french.. &quotFucking Look&quot! My Fiance then looked into the sky, and seen the orb of light I had describe to her twice in the last week. This time was a bit different, though. It was again, slowly moving.. but this time it was steady, and coming straight for us. It was dimming slightly, and returning back to its usual brightness, as it was headed twords us... it wasn't changing in elevation at all, as it went right over our heads. Eventually passing us, and then it took its! same arched flight path, right out of the atmosphere, and out of sight!  This is something that happened to me alone, twice. I explained it to my Fiance both times, on the night of the occurrences.. Then on the last occasion, she was there to witness EXACTLY what I had described to her. Validating everything to her, and even completely to myself. It is 100% unexplainable, and the way it happened, leaves no question in our minds of that. I couldn't make that up twice, and have exactly what I had said, happen a third time.. with a second witness. We are both still absolutely amazed.  Thanks for your time.

Mysterious single bright light flashes over West Michigan.;2015-07-25 23:00:00;~30 seconds;Mysterious single bright light flashes over West Michigan. At approximately 23:00, on the night of 7/25/2015, members of my family and I were on the front porch of our home.  I was seated in such a way that I could see a large area of the night sky.   Suddenly, as I watched a satellite passing in a northerly direction, there was a large, bright flash in the total darkness of the sky.  I commented on it, and it happened again about five seconds later.   At that time, three of my sons came off of the porch and proceeded to watch the sky where I indicated.  Almost immediately, there was another bright flash which was followed again by a bright flash approximately fifteen seconds later.  There were a total of four flashes, with me seeing all four, and my sons seeing two of them. The light appeared to be uniformly round, very bright in comparison to the surrounding stars, and somewhat larger than the largest, brightest stars or planets  that we customarily see in the night sky.  The object seemed to have moved a distance equivalent to holding a dollar bill sideways at arm's length (approximately 2 to 2 1/2 inches).  There were no aircraft in the immediate vicinity, and the light did not flash or pulse like those of any aircraft that I have ever seen.  Simply put, what we saw was a light which appeared out of nowhere, flashed brightly four times in no apparent pattern, and stopped flashing. We have watched satellites and aircraft in the night sky for years, and none of us has ever seen anything like what we witnessed last night.  The light was spotted at approximately 75 degrees, directly north from our position.;43.2157224215246;-86.24096367713
Bright, fast, white light.;2015-08-18 00:40:00;3 seconds;Bright, fast, white light Exited rear of workplace and looked up to see a large, white, very bright light traveling fairly low and very fast.  Cloud ceiling was 12,000 ft this evening and no stars visible.  Object made no sound that I could hear.  After traveling in a straight line from NE to SW it went at a sharp downward angle and disappeared from view.  My first thought was helicopter, but if it were, it would have crashed into the ground.  And it was moving way too fast to be the State Police helicopter that is familiar to our area.  Watched meteor shower for several hours just two nights prior to this, and this was no meteor.  Drone, plane, helicopter?  I don't know, but I've never seen anything like it.;43.2157224215246;-86.24096367713
On the shore of Lake Michigan, we saw what looked like two normal stars, moving from north to south, one following the other.;2015-09-28 01:11:00;45-180 seconds;on the shore of lake Michigan we saw what looked like two normal stars moving from north to south one following the other then they reached another star where their lights turned off. a minute later they reappeared as if the were stars in the night sky.  We watched them sway in synchronicity for 2 mins until the became stationary.;43.2157224215246;-86.24096367713
Very bright light in motion over western Michigan.;2016-06-17 00:02:00;30 seconds;Very bright light in motion over western Michigan. At approximately 00:02 on June 17th, 2016, a co-worker and I were standing outside of the building and looked to the south, toward the moon, and immediately saw a very bright light, moving to the north at a very fast pace.   Our first thought was that it was the space station, but it appeared to be on a trajectory moving away from Earth, and it dimmed and reduced in size very quickly.  The approximate viewing time was 30 seconds or less, and the object appeared to shrink into the distance as it moved to the north.   We went back inside and looked up the viewing schedule for the ISS and discovered that it was neither the ISS, nor was it a scheduled viewing time of the CYGNUS satellite.;43.2157224215246;-86.24096367713
