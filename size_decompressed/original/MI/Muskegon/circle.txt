AS I WAS WATCHING THE JET I SAW I CIRCULAR OBJECT HIGHER THAN THE JET MOVING SOUTH. IT CROSSED ABOVE THE JET SHORTLY AND SHORTLY AFTER WAS NO LONGER VISIBLE DUE TO HAZE. IT FLEW STRAIGHT AND SEEMED TO BE GOING SLIGHTLY FASTER THAN THE JET. I SAW NO LIGHTS OR COLORS, BOTH APPEARED WHITE IN THE SUNLIGHT. THE ONLY THING UNUSUAL WAS THAT IT WAS DEFINATELY CIRCULAR IN SHAPE.;43.2157224215246;-86.24096367713
We saw an object round in  shape appear in the  SW sky that traveled NE  ((NUFORC Note:  Overflight of ISS.  ));2010-08-25 21:35:00;2-3 minutes;We saw an object round in  shape appear in the south west sky that traveled north east and appeared to be flying lower in the sky than most airplanes travel at.We then saw an airplane that had blinking lights cross paths with the object except the airplane looked to be 2 to 3 times as high up in the air. The airplane was traveling North to South. When we looked at the object with binoculars it apperaed to be a bright white circular spaped object but there were no red or blue flashing lights on it. I asked my friend if it was a space station or satelitte, but he pointed out how low in the sky the object was.He said Space stations or satelittes should be higher in the sky than airplanes not lower.

Round low flying object.  White light.;2013-01-14 21:39:00;10 minutes;Round low flying object.  White light. I was letting my dog out like I do every night and always look up to see the stars. I noticed a circle object floating across the sky.  It was dark out and a few low flying clouds.  This object was higher than. the lowest flying cloud.  It seemed to have some kind of low light under it and it only would light up 1/3 of the object at a time.  And the light moved counter clockwise.  It was hard to determine the diameter because of the darkness and distance.;43.2157224215246;-86.24096367713
Reddish orange glitzy UFO circle over Lake Michigan.;2015-02-25 20:30:00;3-5 minutes;Reddish orange glitzy UFO circle over Lake Michigan. This is the second night in a row  same spot over Lake Michigan.   I spotted an object that was circular and was reddish orange with a green haze around it.  It was dazzily and glitzy, and hovered in the same 100 ft radius, moving slowly left and right, and up and down.  Then disappeared.  The first written report I made to you guys was the 25th of Feb., the day after the first sighting.;43.2157224215246;-86.24096367713
