My husband and I were leaving the Hearthstone Restaurant in Muskegon, Michigan at approx. 9:00 pm when we were looking out to the west and noticed Venus in the clear night sky.  My husband said Look at that! and by the tone in his voice I  realized that it wasn't Venus that he was pointing at.  We both saw 2 faint pinkish lights traveling at a high rate of speed, one trailing outside and slightly behind the other.  They started to fly closer to each other, appearing to almost collide.  Their speed dropped very suddenly, they appeared to correct their positions, abruptly changed direction to the northwest and faded out of sight.  It appeared that we were viewing two flat, teardrop shaped, lighted objects.  There were no blinking lights, no noise and all changes of speed and direction were unlike any aircraft we have ever seen.;43.2157224215246;-86.24096367713
Bright white light moving vertical then horizontal.;2013-09-30 07:30:00;10 minutes;bright white light moving vertical then horizontal We saw a bright light moving vertical up from the horizon into the sky at very fast speeds.  The bright white light then moved horizontal across the sky moving at record speed again until it disappeared.  It was seen when the sun was going down and the horizon was glowing orange and red.  The UFO was definitely a bright white light moving very fast first vertical for a very long distance then from East to West until it disappeared.;43.2157224215246;-86.24096367713
