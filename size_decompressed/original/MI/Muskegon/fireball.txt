5 to 6 fireballs traveling northwest;2011-08-12 23:00:00;30 seconds;5 to 6 fireballs traveling northwest I was sitting outside of a friends apartment having a cigarette, waiting for some more friends to arrive. I remember looking into the sky, noticing stars peaking threw the clouds when I saw four very dark red fireballs flying just below the cloud line in a diamond formation. There was one, maybe two trailing behind, almost looking as if they would speed up and slow down just a little to keep up with the formation. I remember they were traveling northwest, at a very high speed, and flying lower than a commercial airline. I watched them for almost 30 seconds until the tree line got in my way. I realize this is now almost a year later, but I remember this sighting as if it happened yesterday. After listening to Mr. Davenport on Coast to Coast tonight, I felt I should submit my sighting.;43.2157224215246;-86.24096367713
UFO sighting in Muskegon, Michigan.;2014-07-13 21:20:00;15 minutes;UFO sighting in Muskegon, Michigan. We observed a comet like flaming object with a mid sized tail moving from the north northeast to the west southwest direction with a 45 degree descent for approximately 15 minutes before going behind the western cloud.   As it moved we could see that there was no residue behind the trail proving it was not a che trail and it periodically grew brighter as if  it was on fire.   Tried to capture it on camera on my phone but it was not picking it up well.  When we increase magnification it does show a circle form.;43.2157224215246;-86.24096367713
