On June 16, 2021 I was driving East on Sternberg Rd. The sky was clear blue with about three or four high altitude chem trails. I stopped at a light and immediately saw an intense white light blinking on and off about 5000 feet in the air. There were no colors just an intense white light. This lasted for about two minutes. I turned and went to Olive Garden. About twenty minutes later while seated outside waiting for a table, a large silver cigar shaped object came from my right flying fairly fast above the treeline. It was completely silver with no markings, no windows, no wings and absolutely no sound. It was approximately 1,000 feet in the air with a length of 500 feet and about 50 feet thick. It had a vertical line in the middle and was flying horizontally. It then in a split second, went about ten miles to the other side of the county and disappeared from view. It stayed at the same altitude the whole time and the event lasted less than 5 seconds.;43.2157224215246;-86.24096367713
