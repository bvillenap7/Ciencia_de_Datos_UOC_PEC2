Shortly after we noticed alot of person airplanes and helicopters in the same direction it took off in.;43.2157224215246;-86.24096367713
A large triangle with lights on the corners moving west to east.;2002-06-08 23:15:00;10 seconds;A large triangle with lights on the corners moving west to east. I was sitting out side and saw a flash (like lightning from a distance) and said to my wife thats odd lighting and no clouds. Then I looked up around the unbrella canopy of our table to be sure there were no clouds, thats when I saw a swirling flash or something and then saw three lights forming a triangle moving west to east and no stars showing with in the triangle. No sound. I was hitting my wifes shoulder yelling look.she did not see. The lites that made up the corners was not the same color as the stars but yellow in comparison.I watched it till it went out of sight. Had it not been moving I never would have seen it.;43.2157224215246;-86.24096367713
Black Triangle flying treetop level slowly over road;2004-02-18 19:50:00;40 seconds;Black Triangle flying treetop level slowly over road My wife and I were driving home in North Muskegon tonight and at 7:50 p.m. as we were coming to the intersection of River Ave. and Orishal Drive (we were driving west toward Lake Michigan) we saw a big black object go across the road at just about tree top level with lights on both ends. We think it was in the shape of a triangle. It went across the road and went down below tree level. The intersection of River and Orishal is about 1 mile from Lake Michigan. The thing we saw seemed pretty big, as big as an airliner, but completely black and it made no noise that we could hear. We were approximately 300 feet from it. Anyway, we saw something, and I want to know if anyone else reported this object.;43.2157224215246;-86.24096367713
Three low flying orange lights forming a triangle with a haze around the object on a clear night.;2009-08-12 22:30:00;5 Seconds;Three low flying orange lights forming a triangle with a haze around the object on a clear night. We were out laying on the lawn trying to watch the last night of the meteor shower when we noticed 3 almost orange in color lights moving across the sky in an almost straight line (possibly a slight zig-zag motion). The lights stayed in perfect unison and did not appear to be very high up (maybe 1000 feet or less on a guess). The odd thing was that although it seemed to be a perfectly clear night the 3 lights appeared to have a large haze around them and it also seemed that there was a slight glow in the middle of the triangle. I can't really judge the speed but it was comparable to a slow and low flying jet except for the fact that there was no noise what so ever (but this also depends on the true size of the suspected object).  I was an Electronics Technician in the US Navy from 00-05. Stationed on an aircraft carrier from 01-05 and have never seen anything like this.  My brother was there also and saw the same thing.  His girlfriend said she saw it and said it looked like a bird or three birds flying in formation or something but I have no idea how she came up with that conclusion and wonder if she even really saw what my brother and I did.  We were all in the same exact location on the ground.;43.2157224215246;-86.24096367713
Orange glowing triangle Muskgon on beach.. grew in size as it came closer, then flashed away as soon as we stood up.;2010-06-10 00:00:00;20 minutes;Orange glowing triangle Muskgon on beach.. grew in size as it came closer, then flashed away as soon as we stood up. My wife and I were siting on the beach in Muskegon, an orange glowing triangle seen in the distance.  It started to get closer and closer...and big as it became close.   We got really worried and thought we should get away ASAP.  As soon as we stood up...the orange triangle was back to its tiny shape and in its original position..  BOTH of us confirmed we say the same thing.. we went out year after year with a camera to try and capture it on film.. but to no avail.;43.2157224215246;-86.24096367713
Three bright orange lights that made a perfect triangle - very large - moved to the East , no noise at all;2016-09-05 00:00:00;30 seconds;three bright orange lights that made a perfect triangle - very large - moved to the East , no noise at all saw two brilliant orange lights that seemed to be moving together , then noticed a third light that made the triangle. I had earlier thought what a great night to see stars , not a cloud in the sky , but realized no stars within the lights . it moved slowly to the east and as it moved stars would show up , I couldn't see an object but something was between those lights! Gone in less than a minute. Can't begin to think how big this must have been. wish my brain would stop thinking about it and let me sleep.;43.2157224215246;-86.24096367713
4 lights over Muskegon Unity Fest.  ((anonymous report));2017-08-12 22:00:00;30 seconds;4 lights over Muskegeon Unity Fest. I was sitting with family & friends at the Unity Christian Music Festival on Saturday evening listening to music.  At one point towards the end of the concert, I was looking skyward due to the meteor shower that would be visible later in the night when I saw 4 faint lights moving together in a Northern direction.  3 formed a triangle & the 4th was to the right... after a few seconds, the lone light started moving in an erratic pattern, then would come back to the side of the triangle. At first I thought it could be a drone taking pictures of the festival, but once the erratic movements of the 4th light started, I knew I was seeing something odd. Shorty thereafter, at least 30 Chinese lanterns became visible several miles to the East, then within 5 minutes, a helicopter took off & circled over towards the lanterns. There were many things to see that evening in the sky, but the 4 lights I saw were quite odd.  They were about the same illumination & size of most of the stars that evening.  The sky was clear that night as well, which allowed for clear sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
