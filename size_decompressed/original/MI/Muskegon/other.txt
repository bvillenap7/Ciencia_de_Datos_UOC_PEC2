Glowing green light dives repeatedly then comes up out of the water.;1998-04-20 21:00:00;10 Mintues;Glowing green light dives repeatedly then comes up out of the water. I live near the Michigan/Ohio border and my husband and I would go camping on Lake Michigan’s west coast.  While walking down to the beach area I stopped half way with a strange feeling that something was out in the lake as though some intelligent being was saying stop here.  It was like a feeling of dread, and was unable to move closer to the water.  My husband was able to go down to the water’s edge. As I looked out over the water I saw a strange greenish light in the water.  This was NOT a boat or ship.  It would dive down and then back up.   After a while it came out of the water and began to travel towards the southeast.  It retained its green color light and as it got to the beach it took off really fast and disappeared.;43.2157224215246;-86.24096367713
I looked back and it was gone.;1998-06-01 19:25:00;19:25;I looked back and it was gone. Went to go grab item thinking it was a children’s rocket ship, I was called by my father . I turned to look and turned back to look at the toy and it was gone. About a foot and a half high yellow and red balanced on three legs . It looked like a children’s rocket ship . The smallest detail was a very small circular window on the center . This is one hundred percent accurate.;43.2157224215246;-86.24096367713
Unknown object in flight over the skies of Western Muskegon;2007-05-14 12:15:00;less than a minute;Unknown object in flight over the skies of Western Muskegon I work in the town of Muskegon, and while on break at around 12:15 in the afternoon, an object in the Western sky caught my attention.  At first I thought it was a bird, but it was approximately 10-15,000 feet up, and I quickly realized two things one, I probably would not be able to see a bird that far up from the ground, and two, it was moving way too fast to be a bird, even with the heavy winds in the area. I watched the object as it crossed the sky, and realized that it was on a straight trajectory to the North, at a very high rate of speed. The thought came into my head that it must be a Military Fighter Jet, however as I lost sight of it, I realized that given the speed it was traveling, I should have heard some type of sound....there was none. One of my co-workers was also on break at the time, and noticed me looking to the sky. She looked up and saw the object as I did, and wondered if it was a jet. I told her that I wasn't sure, given that there was no noise. I may not be an aerospace engineer, but I have been to every Muskegon Air Fair since the age of 5, and I know that you can still hear the jet engines of a Military Fighter Jet as far up as 25-30,000 feet. I'm not sure what it was that we saw, but whatever it was, sure was trying to get somewhere in a hurry. I hope it's good on gas mileage!;43.2157224215246;-86.24096367713
