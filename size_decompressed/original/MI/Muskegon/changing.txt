Star clusters moves and changes shape;2010-04-03 22:00:00;30-60seconds;Star clusters moves and changes shape    This was in total darkness, we looked up to admire the stars and there was a cluster straight ahead of us a little above horizon line.  At first it looked like an unusal cluster of stars but it began to contract and expand.  It moved closer and back, my partner just said, What the HELL!   It looked like a bunch of stars that were oblong in appearence but then condensed together as if you would hold hands and stand in a cirdle and then all run together as a group, in and out close/far.  It then seemed to move father away and then literally was gone into the darkness.  We stood speechless.  We are in our 40's and very level headed and I normally would not become involved, I even called the police, I tried to call the airport too.  The best I can explain it was an oblong chain of lights that moved forward/backwards, condensed and expanded and then disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with theses witnesses, and they seemed to us to be both sincere, and sober-minded.  PD));43.2157224215246;-86.24096367713
