Graduation night of Marlette High School. I was driving my family back to Detroit. Their was 8 of us in the car that night. My aunt and uncle were 20 minutes ahead of us in a different car and seen the same thing. We saw a bright light streaking back and forth across the entire sky range. It did this 3 or 4 times. To travel this distance, this event got everyones attention in the car and other cars on M-53 that night. Their was 8 of us that night in the car. It came North real fast and stopped right above the road. we stopped the car almost right under it. It was so close we could of hit it with a rock. It was a shape of unknown and was completely silent. Their was a haze around one side of the object that made the sky look distorted. The radio signal in the car went dead but the car did not stall. We all got out of the car and the same with the other cars on the road that night. This was around 11 pm or so. It hovered there for a few minutes and then  speed off east in an instant . Alot of cars followed us immediatly to the Romeo State Plolice and filed a report that  night of the incident. They said they had similar reports in the area about an half hour after that in that area. A few minutes after we left the initial area we saw a few of the army aircraft planes  going over the same area we saw the object area but their top speed was now where as fast as this object was.
