THIS WAS THE FIRST OF TWO THAT WAS THERE . I DIDN'T SEE THE SECOND ONE BUT THE ONE I SAW WAS ABOUT 1/4 MILE AWAY. WHEN I FIRST SAW IT  WE WERE GOING NORTH 6 MILES SOUTH OF MARLETTE MI. ON M-53. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A SHINY PARTY BALLOON AS IT MOVED FROM EAST TO WEST , I WATCHED IT MOVE ACROSS THE ROAD. AND GO BEHIND SOME TREES . THATS WHEN I THOUGHT THATS FUNNY THOSE TREES ARE 1/4 MILE AWAY AND I COULD SEE IT PLAINLY . SO IT HAD TO BE REAL BIG AND MORE THAN THE 1/4 MILE THAT THE TREES WERE FROM ME. NO PARTY BALLOON IS THAT VISABLE FROM THAT DISTANCE . WHEN WE GOT TO THE TREES I EXPECTED TO SEE IT IN THE FIELD . THE SECOND ONE WAS ONLY SEEN BY MY PASSENGER . IT LOOKED LIKE A POTATO CHIP BAG KIND OF TUCKED OR PINED AT THE BOTTOM . IT WAS A LOT HIGHER AND MOVED EAST . I AM A RETIRED CITIZEN , GOT ALL MY FACALITIES 53 AT THE TIME . I WAS DRIVING  SO I COULDN'T SEE THE 2ND ONE OUT THE RIGHT WINDOW. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness is anonymous, but describes self as retired.  PD));43.3397;-83.0521
