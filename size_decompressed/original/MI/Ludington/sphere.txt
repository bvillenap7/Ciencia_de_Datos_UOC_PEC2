At approximately 22:47 on June 27, 2014, while sitting on our screened-in porch overlooking Lake Michigan three of us observed an Orange/red sphere moving basically south to north.  It was too bright to be an aircraft, and didn't have flashing marker lights.  Our view is from the eastern shore facing west - so it couldn't have been light reflecting off of an aircraft.  This was a fairly calm night and we couldn't hear any noise from the object. It covered the distance from south to north in a minute or two.   It is hard to judge the altitude maybe several hundred to a thousand feet from the lakes surface.   The cottage porch is about 30 yards from the surf line and 80 feet above the water.  While we were wondering what it could have been at 22:57 ish another object the same as previously described glided by along a slightly more east/north track from south to north like the first one.;43.9696999999998;-86.4416999999996
