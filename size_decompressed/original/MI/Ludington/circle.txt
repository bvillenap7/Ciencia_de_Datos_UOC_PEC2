Big Bright Light;2011-08-14 23:00:00;hour and half;Big Bright Light We were sitting outside with our kids by our fire and when we looked in the sky there was a bright round light flying through the air.  Too fast to be a star or satellite but there were no flashing lights so could not have been an airplane either.   We would watch it fly through the air for a few minutes and then would suddenly appear smaller and then disappear.   This happened about six or seven times while we were watching the meteor shower and then after seeing this a few times we saw a big ball of light in the northern part of the sky. Not sure if it was a comet or not.  That was the last time we saw the big white light though. Right before the comet.;43.9696999999998;-86.4416999999996
