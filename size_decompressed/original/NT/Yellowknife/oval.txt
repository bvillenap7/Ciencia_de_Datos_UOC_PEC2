Twilight sighting of bright, glowing, red, oval and moving object in northern Canada.;2004-12-09 16:15:00;8 minutes;Twilight sighting of bright, glowing, red, oval and moving object in northern Canada. While driving in our small city at very near 4:15 PM (MST)we noticed a bright red object in the sky. It appeared to be moving at high speed although we later debated the speed of the craft at some length. One of us thought that it was moving slowly and for a period was stopped, another thought that it moved at extemely high speed. One thought that it changed directions a number of times. We are confused about the sighting.  It was very bright, and the only object in the sky. It was roundish in shape but probably oval would be more accurate. It seemed big. It was clearly red in colour.  There were no other colours present. Just a steady red glowing light. This was what made it stand out so clearly. It was nearly time for the sun to go down, and the sky was white. Here the night hours start very early due to the location on the globe. The sun was down but there was still light in the sky.  This object was not the northern lights, a star, the sun, a planet, a meteor or anything else we have seen before. Other people saw this object while stopped at one of the main intersections near the hospital and Wal-mart. We could see them looking at the object from their vehicles as well.  The object appeared, from our location, to be right over the main part of the city, and then moved off over Great Slave Lake. We were driving at the time, on our way to the vets to pick up a dog, and when we came out of the vet clinic the object was gone, but the night sky was still bright enough to see that it was gone. It was no star. It moved deliberatly.  It was interesting, but we were not terribly upset or frightened. Just left with a sense of What in the world was that?;62.456;-114.3525
