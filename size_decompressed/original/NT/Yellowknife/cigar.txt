In the air, over Great Slave Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada, I saw motionless, a long silver cigar shaped object in the air. The sky was very cloudy with dark grey clouds. There had been a thundershower about a half hour earlier. This object stood apart from the the clouds as it was shiny, but not like chrome, more like the stainless steel of a medical instrument. It was definatley not flat-colored like the backing clouds.  I could hear no noise, possibly due to my distance from it. I could not tell at about what altitude it may have been at, I am not a meteorologist. It was clearly, in my opinion, not a conventional aircraft. There is significant aircraft activity in this area. Helicopters, float planes and passenger planes of all descriptions. One often looks up to see the aircraft coming and going, and gets to recognize many of the regular aircraft, by their paint and markings.  There is no air polution in this part of the country. This was not a weather balloon, it was motionless. It was not a helicopter, float plane, or regular aircraft, it was silent, and motionless.  I advanced up the road to see if I could get a better look at it, and it moved slowly into the clouds, and did not reappear.  I will say as well that I got the sense that there was more depth to the object than what I could see from my vantage point.  I am not on any medications, drugs or under the influence of alcohol.
