Unusual object observed in skies over Yellowknife.;2004-07-20 14:00:00;20 seconds;Unusual object observed in skies over Yellowknife. Object was observed following a slightly arcing flightpath in a northwest direction approximately 3km north of downtown Yellowknife. Altitude and speed were difficult to estimate. The object appeared only as a dark spot in the sky with no definable shape. The weather conditions at the time were ideal, clear skies and warm temperatures.  As stated, the object had no clear definable shape. However, travelling just slightly ahead were two very shiney spheres, one on top of the other and considerably smaller than the main craft, perhaps even connected. It was quite clear however the object was not a fixed wing or rotary aircraft.  I made visual contact with the object after observing an elderly couple looking skyward. The gentlemen was pointing at the object as it silently moved across the sky overhead. I glanced upward and made visual contact immediately. Speed and altitude were difficult to estimate as I had no references to estimate the size of the object. I visually tracked the object for approximately 20 seconds. I then observed a small group of teenagers approximately 100 meters away from me also visually tracking the object. All of the persons in my immediate area were strangers.;62.456;-114.3525
