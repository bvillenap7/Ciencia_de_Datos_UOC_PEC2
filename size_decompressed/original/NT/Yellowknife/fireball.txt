Blueish Green Fireball the size of a low Moon. I was driving north of Yellowknife on the Ingraham Trail Past the Mines but before Prelude Lake on a hill goind up, I was this flash right in front of me! Heading Northward, looking like it would crash land, Very Fast moving Blueish Green Fireball. It was the summer of 1999 during the Night (Either the start or end of summer as it can get bright at night). Don't know if there was any sound as I was testing the Cruise-ablility of a Burnt CD I just made and had the Dance music blasting... ) Anyhoo, Just thought I'd drop a line as it scared the S**T outta me and Thought it prudent to turn around and head back to town. Wish I had a Jeep Cam like those Police do...;62.456;-114.3525
