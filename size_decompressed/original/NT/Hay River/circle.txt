I stopped to wait for a couple friends coming about 5 minutes behind me. I noticed the moon was very low and in the middle of the cutline. It took out my camera and took a couple pictures one that shows the object and then I zoomed in on the moon and took a second picture the object was out of that photo's field of view. I did not notice the object until I downloaded the photo. The weather ws very clear that morning and about -8 Celcuis. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the anomalous object may be the result of a globule of water on the objective lens of the camera, or perhaps a snowflake, illuminated by the camera's flash.  PD));60.853;-115.6943
