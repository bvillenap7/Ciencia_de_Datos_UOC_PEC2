I was listening to talk on an archived Rense show about golden orbs (fire balls, he was speaking to Peter Davenport. Last year in Darwin many people also saw them. Strangely enough it was at a time when the US military was staging a joint war games exercise - Pitch Black which occurs every year across the Top End of the Northern Territory. One incident was a firework display ona city beach the objects were observed by hundreds of people and hardly even commented on. They travelled slowly across the night sky, formed a triangle and then some manouvres then disappeared. They were also seen by my sister and many other people that we spoke to. Each time the behaviour was similar. The glowing golden objects travelled ina perfectly spaced file across the sky out over the sea. They would then manouver into traiangles and other shapes and then either disapear or rocket off at a great speed. On the local radio a man confessed to having released hundreds of orange garbage bag fire powered devices off at various localities. What a psycho - he must have spent a fortune and to what avail? I myself saw on separate occasions, examples of both types of objects. The pyro devices were erratic in behaviour and it was quite obvious to any viewer as to what they were as they flickered and drifted rising and falling. I saw the latter objects on the night of the lunar eclipse. The other orbs travelled in lines straight and at a constant speed not in any erratic fashion at all. We all think that the orbs were some kind of military test. The amazing thing was how blase people were about them. Oh UFOS maybe? Just thought you might be interested.
