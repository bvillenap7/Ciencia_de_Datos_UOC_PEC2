But heard it break through sound barrier then went silent. looked into the sky in the direction of noise but could not see anything looking for lights of a plane. Maybe low flying fast jet but not in a major city near a civilian airfield on black out. At 20:30 saw chevron shaped lights in sky white light on wings, flashing white light on top and steady red light underneath. Lights vanished except for flashing white light, after approx 1 minute. not sure what it was but definately not military as near civilian airfield and did not look like your normal boeing aircraft.;-12.4497969230769;130.8489
