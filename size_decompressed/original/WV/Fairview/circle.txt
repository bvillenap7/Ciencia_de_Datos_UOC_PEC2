We observed a greenish blue circular object hover for a brief second high in the sky to the north of our location and then suddenly drop toward earth at a very high rate of speed.  There was no tail like a meteor usually has and the color was not like that of a meteor.  It was a very laser like path from a 1 o'clock position in the sky to a 7 o'clock position on the ground (behind the ridge top).  After arriving at work we learned that three other people had witnessed the same event at the same time noted.  They all said the color and behavior was consistent to what we had seen.
