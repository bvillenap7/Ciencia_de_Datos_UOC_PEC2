Small triangle with 3 lights floating low over a field then slowly flying away.;2013-10-10 21:17:00;45 seconds;small triangle with 3 lights floating low over a field then slowly flying away. Object was small and about 100 to 200 feet off the ground over a field near the main road. It had 2 white lights and 1 red light forming a triangle. Object was hovering for about 20 seconds then began to fly slowly away to the north. Initially, I thought it was a helicopter until I saw the specific shape of a triangle.  I then rolled down the window in the car and shut off the engine to check for sound, nothing was heard. Object flew off with white lights forward to the left and right and the single red light to the rear of the object.;39.1751;-80.3807
