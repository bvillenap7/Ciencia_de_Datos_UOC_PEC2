A V-shape formation made up of approximately 8-10 lights.;2008-10-31 00:00:00;8-10 seconds;A V-shape formation made up of approximately 8-10 lights. Approximately 12:25a.m. on october 31, a friend and I saw what appeared to be a v- shape of lights moving in a southward direction. There were 6-8 lights in the v formation. It looked like a flock of geese the way they were flying. We watched for a few seconds and then the 2 lights that were toward the back of the v went out of formation, and did a 'zig-zag' around the lights at the very end of the v. As quickly as the lights moved out of formation, they quickly moved back in the v. The formation didn't seem to slow down when this happened and kept traveling to the south. The lights seemed to be flying higher than a plane, appearing as little white dots in the sky. This lasted for 8-10 seconds, because they never disappeared into the sky, but kept traveling until they were out of sight.
