Large bright sphere seen above Hedgesville forest near Morgan County.;2015-03-25 21:30:00;12 minutes;Large bright sphere seen above Hedgesville forest near Morgan County. First seen while on Rt 9, driving in direction of Berkeley Springs. First observed large white sphere as I passed Tomahawk Rd.  Turned onto Butts Mill Rd and I finally got away from the trees. I heard no sound or saw any flashing lights. I watched it move over trees, moving back and forth, up and down.  When it hovered it became brighter.  I immediately called my daughter to explain situation and told her to expect a text within 10 min that I was OK.  I saw the object the entire way home. When I got home, which is a rural area, I watched it go down low in the distance. It became quite bright. I stood in my yard a few minutes.  No noise. I watched it for maybe a minute and then it just disappeared.  Some neighborhood dogs were barkinv and howling.  When I went in my home my dog was shaking.  She has large ears. Perhaps she heard something I could not. I looked for the object 30 min later. It was still gone. I have not seen it since that day.;39.5191;-78.0894
