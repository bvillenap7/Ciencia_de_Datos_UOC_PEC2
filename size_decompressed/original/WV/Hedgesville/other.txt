I went outside and was able to spot the close orbiting moon at about 11 pm so I yelled for my friend to come check it out.  As we were both looking at it a strange orange object started moving through the sky out of no where.  There were no blinking lights on the object and I was trying to convince myself that it was a helicopter but I never heard any sounds.  I don’t really know what shape the object was but if I had to give my best educated guess I would say whatever a helicopter looks like from a distance in the sky.  My friend was telling me that he thought the movement of the object was weird, sort of wobbling while flying through the sky.  I thought it was strange as well, but I can’t really explain it.  It just seemed to move unlike a completely “normal” flying object.  We watched the object move for about 15 seconds until it went behind a cloud.  It should have only been behind the cloud for maybe 2 seconds, but it never reappeared anywhere in the sk! y.  It was cloudy out that night however, the path that the object was headed on should have been clearly visible.  I know of no object that could change its trajectory so that I would not have seen it fly out of the cloud.;39.5191;-78.0894
