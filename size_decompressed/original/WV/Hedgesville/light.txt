10-15 lights over hedgesville, WV;2005-03-20 08:30:00;10 minutes;10-15 lights over hedgesville, WV I was coming home from a movie with my friends and i looked up at the sky for a sec and saw 3 bright lights in a triangle in the southeastern part of the sky. and as we watched these lights we saw more lights moving in the same direction as the original lights. As the lights in the triangle lights started to move they dimmed and when off in different directions. One light flew over at about 50-75 feet up and about 250 feet away and it made no sound. As it flew over the dogs in the development went crazy and were barking very loudly. it was very weird because the dogs had not been barking before.the lights were a bright redish.

a star like light moving irratically and changing colors (red,green/blue, white);2005-09-06 22:15:00;30 plus minutes;a star like light moving irratically and changing colors (red,green/blue, white) Noticed a star like object that was changing colors from red to white at first.  The object moved behind some tree limbs and back to the open sky in a motion like a ball bearing being moved in a tupper ware container.  It also moved in 90 and 45 degree angles.  It was observed for more than a half hour, as jet liners passed on their normal routes, I knew it was not a plane.  The light later changed from a red, to a white, then to a blue/green color in no set pattern.  It did not shoot off in any direction, just faded out in an off white color.;39.5191;-78.0894
Bright star-like craft flying over the valley just about every night and posted web info on it just seems to disappear.;2010-07-10 21:00:00;4 hrs;Bright star-like craft flying over the valley just about every night and posted web info on it just seems to disappear. About every night for the past month I have seen a bright statlike aircraft flying through the valley.  I ussually notice it in the sky right before it gets dark and it seems to be stationary.  After dark it drops altitude and stays low to the ground.  It shines a very bright lite and makes very weird patterns through the night skies.  I have noticed that when vehicles are passing through the valley it will get real dim and almost dissapear so it is not spotted.  After the vehicles pass it gets bright again. It also dims when it is changing its location.  My wife and kids have also seen this.  Nobody seems to know what it is and everything I've googled on it in the last week has magically disappeared on the web.  I believe it's top secret and it's also a way for the government to invade peoples privacy.  Like a said, everything I've read about it just seems to disappear off the web the next day.;39.5191;-78.0894
