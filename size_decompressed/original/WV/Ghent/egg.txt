It was scary!;1987-03-08 12:27:00;10 minutes;It was scary! We were driving one night to the gas station down Odd Rd..  This road is very dark at night. Me and my three buddies were going out to get some beers.  On the way we saw this big flash of light and it made all of us jump out our boots.  Our car engine died and wouldn't re-start.  We looked up and saw a green glowing egg shaped craft. We got scared and ran through the woods.  We later returned to out car and there was no sign of the craft.  We told the sheriff but he didn't believe us. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));37.6203;-81.1044
