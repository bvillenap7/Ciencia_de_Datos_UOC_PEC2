Athens.;2017-03-21 04:00:00;3 seconds;I was driving to work, later down the road when I was turning onto the I-77 on ramp from Athens, I saw very briefly towards the West (about 3 sec) a small chevron shaped object maneuvering through the clouds/fog over the Camp Creek area around 4am this morning,   It swooped down from the fog and did a loop and swooped back up into clouds/fog, it had no lights only a dark circle under its belly, the reason why I got a glimpse of it is because when it swooped down the glow of the city lights reflected off its belly, the size of this thing was about the size of a small aircraft and it was about 1200ft in the air and about 4mi away from my location over the hills, like I said I only saw what it did very briefly and never saw it again.  It might have been a military test drone, I've heard that the WV air force base in Charleston sometimes test aircraft over the area.;37.4298;-81.0012
