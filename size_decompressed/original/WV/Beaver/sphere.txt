5 spheres over Beaver.  ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch from Wallops Island.  PD));2017-06-29 04:25:00;20 seconds;5 spheres over Beaver This is the 2nd time I'm contacting this site, I reported a sighting back in March in the Athens area and today I was a witness to another event much more bigger and closer than the last sighting.   I travel 40mi to my job in Beaver 5 days a week from Athens, most of I-77 and I-64 to my work does not have lights and it's a drive in the dark most of the way, when I was traveling East on I-64 I was 3 exits away from Airport Road that leads to the industrial park, I noticed to the Northeast Venus and to the East I noticed a light behind some clouds, which I assumed was the moon, when I reached my exit I noticed that the light was getting bigger and just when I started to turn into the exit I noticed to my right the light had broken through the clouds to reveal a huge purple sphere with 4 smaller purple rounded spheres under it in perfect formation (best way to describe the formation of the 4 rounded spheres on the botton is like the 4 dots on a pair of dice), about 300 yards away from me and about a height of 1500-2000 feet, I had no where safe to pull over and take a photo because this exit is very small and has concrete barriers on both sides and I had at least a vehicle behind me, when I finally got on Airport Road, I passed the Shell gas station and noticed 2 people in the stations parking lot looking up to the sky in the direction the spheres were, I decided to pull over in front of the hotel accross the street from the gas station to take a 2nd look at this thing and to attempt to take a photo, when I got out of my vehicle the spheres were gone but I could notice a very faint purple trail mixed in the clouds left behind by this thing. I will send a photo I found online that's very similar to what I saw and a drawing to this sites email address.;37.7492;-81.0725
