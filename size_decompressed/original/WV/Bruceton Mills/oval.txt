Glowing object in sky soared across night sky then vanished.;2007-01-17 20:45:00;30 seconds;Glowing object in sky soared across night sky then vanished. Walking from my barn to house with dogs, turned to listen to coyotes, I was standing on an uphill driveway above treeline.  I saw an oval or round light that looked like it was falling across the sky.  It definitely was not a plane, too big too fast.  It was not a falling star, too big, too slow.  Meteor, not sure.
