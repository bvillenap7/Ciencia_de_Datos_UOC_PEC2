Saw a triangle shaped craft, very large, made very little noise, low altitude.;2000-03-01 00:30:00;15 mins;Saw a triangle shaped craft, very large, made very little noise, low altitude. We were riding on an old reclaimed strip mine. He had stoped to rest and take a little break and enjoy the view from the top of the largest grassy hill on the strip when we noticed a triabgle shaped craft moving south to north across the sky, the craft was very low altitude, well below 10,000 ft, very large, moved fairly slowly, took about 5 mins for it to go completely out of sight. the were 4 lights on the object, all white, 3 small white ones on the points of the triangle, and a large U shaped light in the middle of the craft. The area that this object was seen in is a very rural area with no major airport near, nor any military bases, only mountains and small towns and alot of mining activity.;37.5821;-81.5377
