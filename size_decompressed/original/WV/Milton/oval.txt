24 ORANGE LIGHTS OF MILTION, WV.;2013-09-01 00:55:00;15 minutes;24 ORANGE LIGHTS OF MILTION, WV. I'M A POLICE OFFICER THING OF 13 YEARS AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.  I STARTED NOTICING THE OBJECTS APPEARING OVER THE TREES OF THE HORIZON AND THEY LOOKED TO BE GOING THE SPEED OF A HELICOPTER OR A LITTLE SLOWER.   AFTER ABOUT 10 OF THEM WENT PAST ME I NOTICED THAT SOME OF THEM HAD DISAPPEARED WITHOUT A TRACE.   THEY ALL SEEMED TO ALMOST FOLLOWING A FLIGHT PATH AS IF THE WERE ON OR STRING UNTIL 3 OF THEM HAD WENT INTO A FORMATION OF A TRIANGLE.   I STARTED VIDEO TAPING FROM MY I PHONE AND DECIDED TO CALL MY DISPATCH CENTER AND HAVE THEM TRANSFER ME TO TRI-STATE AIRPORT.  I TALKED TO A AIRCRAFT CONTROLLER AND TOLD HIM MY STORY AND SENT HIM A VIDEO.    HE STATED THAT HE HAD NOTHING IN MY AREA BESIDES 2 COMMERCIAL AIRLINES.  HE ALSO HAD SEEN SOMETHING APPEAR AND THEN DISAPPEAR OFF THE RADAR SCREEN AS I WAS TALKING WITH HIM.  THERE WAS CLOUD COVER LAST NIGHT AND THE OBJECTS WERE BELOW THEM. I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TOO SHARE WHAT I HAVE ON VIDEO OR ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ALSO TO NOTE THERE WAS NO SOUND AND IT WAS VERY QUIET OUTSIDE.  THE OBJECTS WERE ORANGE, KINDA REMINDED ME OF THE FIRE FROM A HOT AIR BALLOON.;38.4167;-82.1488
