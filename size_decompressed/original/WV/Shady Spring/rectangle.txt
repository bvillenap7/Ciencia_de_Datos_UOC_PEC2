Self-contained glass box of fire;2011-03-22 21:50:00;5 minutes;Self-contained glass box of fire Can only be described as a square form, such as a glass box that appeared to contain a burning fire.    The object appeared to hover approximately 100 meters above the ground near my home.  Its motion was steady and traveled in a northwestern to southeastern path, moving in the direction of Summers County from Shady Spring.   It offered no noise, no change in trajectory, and constant speed of travel.  The glow was a bright, burning orange yet it provided no illumination to the ground or any surrounding trees or landscape.;37.7416;-81.0149
