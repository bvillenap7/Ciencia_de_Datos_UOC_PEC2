3 pulsating lights in small town West Virginia;2012-09-22 23:30:00;5 hours;3 pulsating lights in small town West Virginia On the evening of Sept 22 2012 i was getting ready for bed i walked to my kitchen window and looked outside and seen this big red pulsating light.  I called for my husband to look at it then i noticed two more red pulsating lights to the right of the other light.The other two lights were smaller than the first light i seen.  I grabbed my phone and started recording.I watched the bigger of the three lights move very slow it would go up and down and side to side.  The two smaller lights one was moving up and down and side to side and the other one would do circles around the other small light, and it would go towards the other small light and then back and the whole time it looked like the lights were pulsating.I started taking pictures and on my phone.  When i would zoom in on the lights to take the picture the lights looked like a grey blob same thing while i was recording.  The weird thing that puzzled me was each picture i took of the lights they all showed up a diff! erent color and the only thing i seen was red pulsating lights.  I don't believe in this kinda stuff but i know what i saw and after that night i am a believer..;38.8669;-82.114
