PD));2007-05-15 23:00:00;45 minutes;It started like a bright star,then moved quickly across the sky, changing colors and size of the light It started out looking like a bright star. On the video disc, we caught it moving rapidly. It seems to have a flat bottom at times and on the video, it looks like a saucer at the bottom of a big , round light. To the naked eye, it seems to move slowly, but on the video it moves very fast. It has red, blue, grren and yellow colors. It goes from a small light to a very large one. Usually, comes about 20 till 11 and leaves about 11:30. While filming, it also seems to come straight at the camera, then descipate into a starburst or large shadow. You can also see shadows on the video of it zipping by. It comes down and hovers above a tree line on top of a hill across from my sisters house. I discovered it while taking my dog outside for a walk before going to bed. I called to my two sisters to come see. They have no clue what it is. We showed the film to my brother-in-lAW when he came home from work.He has no idea what it is either.I have filmed it about 4 times in 2 weeks.
