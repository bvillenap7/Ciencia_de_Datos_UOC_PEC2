Bright light appeared and lost time now having weird dreams;2008-03-15 23:15:00;40 minutes ?;Bright light appeared and lost time now having weird dreams  I was 17 years old. I was at my girlfriends house and it was a school night she lived aproximatly 30 mins from my house.  So having a curfew of 23:30, I would leave her house at exactly 23:00 every night. I left on time that night traveling south bound on St Rt 62 from Mt Alto, WV, Headed towards Hatrford, WV. I was on time so I was traveling the posted speed of 55 mph, give or take a few.  As I headed into the area known as &quotBrinker Hollow&quot I saw a large bright light in front of me at the tree line. I'm a vol. firefighter so I knew it wasn't healthnets helicopter I would have heard them on my radio. It was so bright that I remember rolling down my driver side window and starting to come to a halt. From my memory I heard no noise, just saw that bright light. The next thing I remember my phone is ringing and I'm about 2 miles south of where I saw the bright light. It was my father yelling at me asking me why I wasn't home. I made up a quick story that ! wasn't believable. I saw on my phone that aproximatly 40 mins of my time had disapeared. I had multipal missed calls from my girlfriend and from my dad.  For the longest time that night was just stashed away in my past although now I am having vivid dreams of the missing 40 mins.
