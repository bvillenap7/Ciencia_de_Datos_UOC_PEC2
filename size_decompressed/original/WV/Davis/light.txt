Large Flickering Light;2009-10-15 22:00:00;at least 10 minutes;Large Flickering Light I was leaving work at Blackwater Falls, approaching the intersection of Rt. 32 when I noticed something in the sky out toward Rt. 93. The object caught my eye because it was very large (larger than any star, planet, or satellite that I've ever seen) and was flickering. After turning onto Rt. 32, I decided to proceed onto Rt. 93 to get a better look, as I thought that it may be a helicopter. I stopped about 1 mile down Rt. 93 and turned off my vehicle. I got out and listened to see if I could hear a sound coming from the object, such as rotors.  The object made no sound at all.  Upon determining that it wasn't a helicopter, I got freaked out and left about as quickly as I had come. ((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.
