2AM dog went crazy trying to hide-- no moonlight in room, then object left and light came back.;2007-05-08 02:00:00;10 min;2AM dog went crazy trying to hide-- no moonlight in room, then object left and light came back. At 2 am Monday night - my dog awoke me - he was trying to get under me or the pillow and blankets, he was frantic. I woke up and noticed that there was no light in my room, which is normally lit by Moonlight. in a few minutes the object that was blocking the light left and the moonlight came backin the room. I went to look outside and did not see anything-- but I did see the shadow moving and light replacing it. It took me some time to calm my puppy down, he was shaking in his boots. any ideas on what that could have been. ??;39.345;-78.7509
