Bright red object seen in sky.  ((anonymous report));2016-08-05 21:46:00;2 minutes;Bright red object seen in sky. I was just finishing yard work late in the evening when I noticed a brightly lit red colored object in the southern sky.  Object was moving in easterly direction.  Object was bright, then oscillated to a lower brightness intensity, then went dark.  One minute later another object with exact same characteristics followed the same path as the first object.  Sky was very clear, and it was easy to discern how these objects were much different than other planes, which were also in the sky.
