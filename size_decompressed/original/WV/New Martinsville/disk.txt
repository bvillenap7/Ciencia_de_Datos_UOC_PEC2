Orange Compact Disc Shaped UFO Seen Over West Virginia;2003-03-08 20:00:00;45 seconds;Orange Compact Disc Shaped UFO Seen Over West Virginia Five men were standing outside.  One looked up and noticed an orange compact disc shaped object moving very quickly through the air.  It had a slight zig zag to it's movement.  Also, there was no exhaust trail.  There were no blinking lights to indicate an air plane, plus it moved in a way too erratic for any airplane or helicopter to move.  The center was not as lit as the outside edges were.  All of us saw the shape.  At one point, we moved because it was starting to go behind some trees.  Three of us went one way, two of us went another.  From about a hundred feet apart, all of us saw it until it disappeared into the horizon.;39.6598;-80.8616
