My mother and I and 3 neighbors were talking in our alley way late that evening. Out of nowhere appeared a large disk over our homes and lit up like a Christmas tree. It hovered stationary briefly,Then as fast as we could blink it moved from its' stationary position to a higher one where it,again, hovered there for a moment and and then was gone with a flash.
