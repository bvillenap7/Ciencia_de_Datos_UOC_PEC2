Ball of light;2019-11-29 00:00:00;Less then a min;Ball of light Me and my partner was driving back from a transport to Parkersburg and we was headed back to Charleston when in the sky we noticed a bright light that was stationary for a second or so and the it moved to the left at a high rate of speed. At first I thought it was the airport light but it was to fast and it never returned in the sky. After looking in the sky for a few mins I started to tell my partner what I saw and he interrupted me and finished what I was saying which the same story. About 15 mins later I was looking in the sky trying to repeat the experience and all of a sudden in a different are of the sky further away I seen the same thing happen again this time my partner stated that he seen it before I could say something. After driving for another 30 min we see the glow of Charleston and we can see the airport light which is yellowish on on bulb and green on the second one and no where near as bright as the anomaly we seen earlier.;38.6242;-81.6218
