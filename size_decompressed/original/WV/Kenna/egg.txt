When they were doing the Walley world scene at the end of the movie they caught a UFO in the scene where they board the last roller coaster.  The one with the Loop.  When they assend the first hill you can see the skyline on the shot when they reach the very top of the hill. If you freeze frame the dvd or VCR you can see something strange in the air.  I know this sounds crazy.  Look into it. ((NUFORC Note:  We will try to find a copy, or an e-address for Chevy Chase, to confirm the claim.  There are similar report for the movie, Jaws, at the point in the movie at which Robert Shaw is describing the sinking of the USS Indianapolis in the Pacific during the end of WWII.  When the actors go onto the deck of the fishing boat, and object streaks below clouds.  Seconds later in the film, a similar event can be seen to occur.  We have no way of knowing what the filmed objects were.  PD));38.6242;-81.6218
