We saw a craft slowly moving north at night. Object was about 500ft up moving at about 10 MPH. We watched it form about 1/2 mile out to where it was directly overhead. Some sound of a propulsion system, not a prop or helicopter, but similiar to a jet engine. Round light pattern of multi-colors, dozens of lights, in a circular patten. Object was solid and nearly hovered above the house for 2 minutes. In a instant, the craft went form a near still position to a speed that must have been 1000 MPH, absolute impossible acceleration, going to the North to a distance of possibly 3 miles in a matter of a second. It then did a rapid zig-zag pattern 3 times and shot up into the sky and was lost form our sight. (Mother, sister & myself) Object originally spotted by my aunt who saw it form her house about 5 miles away and called us to go outside and look. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));38.6242;-81.6218
