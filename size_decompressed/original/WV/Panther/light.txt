And yes it was moving, I also told my self it was a satiate, then it went away like some one turned off a light, so I said to my self it was a asteroid, and as soon as a was about look away, it lit back up in the same spot it disappeared in and shot to my right  un realistically I ran in the house and told my wife I was freaking out, I never believed but now I'll never look at the sky the same again.;37.4818;-81.8931
