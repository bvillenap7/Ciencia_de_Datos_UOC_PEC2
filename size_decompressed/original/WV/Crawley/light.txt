I was standing outside in my yard when i looked up and seen a light flying towards me i watched as it went over me it made NO sound what so ever and was very bright and going real slow.  Iv been seeing these lights (UFOs) since 6-25-2012 since then iv been going out every night to watch the sky's and almost every nights i see at least one and i have at least 15 different videos of these events.  I seen way more than what iv got on video.IV had them stop and hover right over top of me just a little higher than tree top and still no sound what so ever i have had them shine their light at me after shining my spot light at them this happened several different times.  Iv also seen them stop on a dime and either make a right or left and even shoot straight up in to the black sky and gone in a flash.Iv seen what looked like to giant headlights drop out of the sky from no where as it came closer and closer the lights would go out and then about ten min or so i would start seeing what looks like a single points of lights flying around.I know of at least 15 different people that have seen these lights.  I know this all this sounds crazy and hard to believe but it's i can barley believe it my self something is going on !;37.938;-80.6287
