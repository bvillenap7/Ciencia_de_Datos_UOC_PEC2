Had 3 beers 1 had a drink koozie around it, the one I was drinking. Started to notice some strange beams of light around our cabin. Beams of light started to hit the trees around us, we never got out of the hot tub. A car pulls onto the road and stops in front below our cabin. They seem confused as the passenger gets out to look our direction as if they're seeing something we aren't. As we are looking at them the light beams get brighter then shoots away. The passenger gets back in the car and they drive away. Like I said we never got out of the hot tub but my drink koozie is missing, as if we were taken out of the hot tub and put back but not as we were found. The koozie wasn't found until the next morning by the tree that had been flashing with a bright beam the night before. I believe we were 100% visited by aliens. Time was missing and our drink koozie being out of place was a giveaway too. Marks on my body were found the next day as well.;37.9722;-81.1579
