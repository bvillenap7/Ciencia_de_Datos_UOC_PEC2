Burning glowing sphere(sparks);1996-07-05 00:00:00;about a month;Burning glowing sphere(sparks) Around early summer of 1994 me and a friend was sitting on parents porch talking when I happen to notice a weird object in the eastern sky. It seem to be traveling at a slow rate of speed and at tree level. Object was round with bright orange glow, as if it was on fire. Had sparks falling from the rear or off of it. At first I thought it was a rescue flare but was too small. We watched for about 10 min. No sound, No other lights. 3 more objects followed the path in the same course as the first. If the first slowed the others followed. I saw these several times during a month in diffrent formations from diffrent directions. There was up to 5 but no less than three.My parents, my brother, and my neighbors all saw them. I am sure that someone else in Oak Hill or surrounding area did too. I have kept looking for them but I havn't seen them since that year. I still have no answer to what we saw.;37.9722;-81.1579
