Object made 3 - 90 degree turns and then disappeared.;2009-08-27 21:00:00;approx. 4 min.;Object made 3 - 90 degree turns and then disappeared. Object blinking red and white lights very fast was seen heading West, then North, then East, and then South before disappearing.  The object could not be made out because it was to high up, however, as it changes each direction it was done in a 90 degree turn.  They were not rounded turns in any sense of the way - straight out right angles. We watched it for about a minute, it then turned and traveled for about thirty seconds or so each time before turning again, and after the third turn we watched it for about 20 seconds and it just disappeared.
