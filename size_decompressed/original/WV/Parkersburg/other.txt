Im 22 now. And i turned and saw 4 huge lights very low to the ground flying straight twords me. They made absolouty no sound what so ever. The lights were very bright but did not shine they didnt give off light it was just liek the were light but they had a light gray rim around all the lights  as if it was metal. They flew as if they were almost connected together, but I didnt see anything connecting them. They came at me slow growing larger and larger. There is a big tree in my neighbors yard they turned right behind the tree. It was like it pivited on the first  light and then just dissapered. If you have heard anythig like this please let me know.. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));39.2666406779661;-81.5268237288134
