The object at first apeared to be a plane and i live by an airport and can tell when a plane is moving to slow to stay airbourne, in fact this space craft was still to the human eye, and was extremely low to the ground.  The craft was oval in shape and appeared to have numerous windows, and had 2 parts one was the main structure and the other seemed like a observation deck.  It was gray/silver in color.  The area in which i observated the craft was over a hill near a field with cows and a winding creek near a church.  The object turned towards our car and jerked like a pendulum as if it were gaining momentum and shot towards the sky to be unseen again.
