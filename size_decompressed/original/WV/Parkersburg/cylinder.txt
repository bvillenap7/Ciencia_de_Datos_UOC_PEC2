Cylinder/cigar shaped light tube slowly climbs higher and higher.;1999-08-15 01:00:00;2 minutes;Cylinder/cigar shaped light tube slowly climbs higher and higher. We were outside letting our dog out, it was a nice late night.   Something moving in the sky caught my eye.  I looked in the direction, high above a nearby tree, and saw a HUGE, but very far away, tube of light slowly climbing higher and higher in the sky.  By slow I mean that it was slow moving to my eye, but, with it's distance, it had to be really moving fast.   I yelled at my husband (who was playing with the dog) to look, what is that ? He turned, he saw it, and we both watch it for maybe 1 to 2 minutes.  At first we thought maybe it was a huge firecracker that was going to finally explode or start falling downward, but, that never happened.  It was too bright, but, did not actually give off light, I didn't light up anything around it like a lightbulb would.  It steadly climbed, climbed and climbed, at maybe a 45 degree angle.  Then, it was as if someone flipped a switch and turned it off, it was just gone.  This sounds strange I know, but, it was as if it flew behind something, although there was nothing there for it to fly behind.   This object did NOT give off light, it was light, as if it were just light and nothing else, a white light tube. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.;39.2666406779661;-81.5268237288134
