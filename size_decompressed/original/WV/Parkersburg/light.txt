At approx. 2049, myself, mother, father, and family friend(who was out of line of sight)was setting outside. I noticed in the north sky a light that starting getting brighter and brighter, as if it was coming closer. The light was a brilliant white. I have never seen any color of light like this. I said an exploitive and my parents turned. My father saw over half of the incident. My mother witnessed it and stated it was an air plane. As she was making that statement, the light began to dim and get smaller at a slow but steady pace. It continued this unitl it loked like it went away from us, seeing the light dim to nothing.;39.2666406779661;-81.5268237288134

Hovering red light over Parkersburg.;2013-06-21 22:50:00;30 seconds;Hovering red light over Parkersburg While driving home heading south within city limits we noticed a bright red light hovering(it was stationary) in the sky above.  At first it appeared to resemble a low air craft as earlier there was a low flying helicopter.  However this light was not moving and we noticed it wasn't making any sounds.  After remaining stationary for several seconds the light started to fade (wife says fizzle)then it changed to a bright white light and then faded and vanished.;39.2666406779661;-81.5268237288134
Several lights seen over Parkersburg, WV;2014-05-03 21:45:00;3-5 minutes;Several lights seen over Parkersburg, WV While at work in Parkersburg, I stepped outside around 9:45pm to talk on the phone to a friend.  During the conversation, I looked in the direction of US50 and initially saw four orange lights in a triangle shape, heading in a south east to north west direction.   After a minute or so, I saw four to five more lights appear, and all changed direction to the north.   After around 5 minutes, all the lights had disappeared, no obstructions to block view before the dissapearence. The objects appeared to be over US 50/I-77, and maybe 1,00 feet or more in the air.;39.2666406779661;-81.5268237288134
I saw a series of 10-12 bright orange lights rise silently into the sky and move northeast over the course of about 15 minutes.;2019-03-29 20:10:00;15 minutes;I saw a series of 10-12 bright orange lights rise silently into the sky and move northeast over the course of about 15 minutes. At approximately 20:10, I saw a bright orange light appear on the horizon (which is a hilltop from my vantage point) at roughly 270 degrees.  It rose into the sky and proceeded to move northeast. I would guess that it's altitude was at least 1000 feet.  When it reached a bearing of about 30 degrees, another identical light rose, again at about 270 degrees, to approximately the same altitude and moving at about the same speed (as far as I could tell).  I could perceive no noise from the lights there was traffic moving on the road below me which was fairly noisy, but even when that fell quiet I could not hear any noise from the lights.  The lights remained steady in color and intensity I could observe no strobes nor navigation lights. The pattern of lights rising at 270 degrees an proceeding northeast continued for about 15 minutes.  As they made their way northeast, their altitude  varied, with the highest no more than 50% higher than the lowest.  At least twice, two lights rose at the same time and separated somewhat as they moved northeast.  My observation was interrupted for about 3 minutes, as I went inside to get my phone at about 20:15.  I didn't have the presence of mind to keep a good count, but I know there were at least 10 lights, but more likely 12. I do have a few minutes of iPhone video, but it is too large to email conventionally - I'll attempt to send it via an iCloud dropbox.;39.2666406779661;-81.5268237288134

But as I watched I seen 7 more directly behind the other spaces perfectly... The crafts went from one side of the horizon to the other in a matter of 1.5-2 minutes...;39.2666406779661;-81.5268237288134

The yellow light appeared to have a deliberate course and was straight. While I was watching, the light vanished/went away. It did not extinguish or go out but stopped.  I looked to see if it would reappear following with my eye it's trajectory, but it did not reappear. No clouds in sky to hide light. No sound from traveling light.;39.2666406779661;-81.5268237288134
