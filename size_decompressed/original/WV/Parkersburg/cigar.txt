Cigar shaped silver shining object seen in clear daytime sky.;2005-02-15 14:45:00;5 minutes;Cigar shaped silver shining object seen in clear daytime sky. It was a warm day for February, around 55 degrees. My nephew was on my roof cleaning out the gutters, that is the only reason I was looking up, I was watching him on the roof (he is 21).  I saw it first, really moving FAST, coming from the south-east and heading north-west. It was huge, it appeared to be silver, and very bright, as if light was being shined on it, it had no lights, nothing flashing, no sound, and no tail or jetstream. It was huge and we could see it very well, as the sky was clear. It had no front or rear, and no windows, it's entire shape was the same.  As soon as I saw it, I asked my nephew what it was, he looked and we both watched it. As it started to get out of our vision, a jet was coming toward us from the north (it had a fuel trail as a jet does), these two objects were going to cross paths and were nearly side by side at one point. The jet was high in the sky and tiny (although you could tell that it had wings), and this thing was four or five times longer than the jet.  I am stunned to say the least, we really have no clue what it is we saw.;39.2666406779661;-81.5268237288134
