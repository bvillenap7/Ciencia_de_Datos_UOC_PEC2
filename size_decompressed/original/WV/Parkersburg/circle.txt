Multi-colored craft hovering above me.;1980-06-01 05:00:00;3 minutes;multi-colored craft hovering above me. I was 12 maybe 13 years old. I had a morning paper route and usually set out around 04:45 to start delivering my papers. When the event happened it was still dark and I was walking down a deadend road. The road stopped near a large wooded area. I didn’t hear anythingbut all of a sudden these lights appeared overhead, directly over me. There were 4-5 separate lights…white, light gold and green were the colors. The lights were large not small and they, looking back, were about 200 feet off the ground. I could not see the complete shape of the ship/aircraft but the leading edge that I did see was rounded so I am assuming the entire craft was round or oval. Being so young out by myself, I was shakien a bit, so I immediately looked away and began walking fast away from it. When I got a football field in length away I turned around. And it was gone. No noise nothing. I have never told anyone about what I saw.;39.2666406779661;-81.5268237288134

On the above listed approx. date and time i was on patrol in the northern end of the city parked running radar in the 2600 blk of dudley ave.  At the approx time listed i observed a bright blue light that illuminated  the entire sky that lasted for approx. 5 seconds.  the blue light immediately turned to a bright green color that lasted approx 5 more seconds.  the light then suddenly stopped at which time it was as if nothing had happened.   another officer who was approx 16 city blocks away (approx 3 miles) then asked the other units working if they had witnessed the incident.  myself along with 2-3 other officers advised him he had. our dispatcher then advised they were recieving a heavy amount of calls from civilians reporting the strange lights that illuminated the sky.  the shift superviser then contacted the state police detachment in charleston, which is an hour away from parkersburg, and was advised the had also recieved multiple reports of the same lights.  the officer that had spoken on the radio asking if others had witnessed the light advised me he saw a ball of light that was blue,changed to green, then dissipated completely.

Bright white light flying in the sky, hovering and diapeared before our eyes.  ((NUFORC Note:  Satellite??  PD));2008-06-05 22:10:00;1 minute;Bright white light flying in the sky, hovering and diapeared before our eyes We were standing outside talking, when we saw a round light in the sky.  It got really bright and was flying over us high in the sky.  It changed directions a couple of times and flew backwards.  It seemed like it hovered or slowed down and was in one spot.  It got brighter and faded to nothing right before our eyes.  We didn't think it could be a plane because you can always see the flashing lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Satellite??

Large bright white light traveling quicky in the Northwest sky.;2013-06-28 01:30:00;30 seconds;Large bright white light traveling quicky in the Northwest sky I was getting ready for bed and around 1:15 my dog wanted to go outside.  I let her out and waited about 15 minutes then started for the back door and noticed a big white light through the window.   My first thought was that it was a street light and maybe the storm had knocked down trees that normally block them on the next street over.  When I opened the door I saw the light was over the trees and moving very fast traveling East in the Northwest sky making no sound.  It was as large and bright as a streetlight!  I watched it for several seconds until it was blocked by a neighbor's tree. I ran inside to grab my phone and headed out the front door but it was gone.  I went back in and out the backdoor to get my dog and she would not come to me.  She was crying and would not come out from underneath the house.  I finally had to coax her to come out.;39.2666406779661;-81.5268237288134
