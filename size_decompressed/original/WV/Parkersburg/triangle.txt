I was training a new driver for my truck route. After we had passed the Ohio/Virginia border, he yelled,Look at that.  So, I pulled the truck over and we both got out.  Just to our left, and bigger than my hand as I stretched out my arm, was a black triangular craft with a dim, white, light on each corner and a dim red/orange light in the middle.  It seemed to be so close, you could throw a rock up and hit it.  However, it did not even make the slightest noise.  We observed it for at least ten minutes, as it glided toward the large hills that dominate the area on Interstate 77.  It should be noted that Wright Patterson AFB. is only a couple hundred miles to the west of this sighting. Personally, I do not believe that this craft was manufactured anywhere on earth. It did not have the look of any conventional aircraft that I have ever seen before or since. Also,  maybe you remember the story of Indrid Cold, this was the name of the alien who kidnapped a man from Mineral Wells, W.Virginia.  Mineral Wells, was only six miles more south from this sighting.  After much reading, I find there is supposed to be a vortex of sorts in this general vacinity.  Well, that's about the extent of what I have to say about this particular incident.  Thanks for listening. I appreciate it. ((Name and address deleted));39.2666406779661;-81.5268237288134
