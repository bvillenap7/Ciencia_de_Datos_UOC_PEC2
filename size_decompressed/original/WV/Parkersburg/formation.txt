At 11:45 Jan 30, 2016.  I had just parked my car and got to the top of my stairs, when I looked up and seen 6 objects in a somewhat circle pattern formation flying across the sky above Grand Central Mall in Vienna, going north into Ohio.  This was directly above the Ohio River.   The sky was clear in places but they flew in or below the clouds.  I seen them do things our planes cant do.  They moved eradic in their formation.  They then split into two teams of 3 and went into 2 triangle formations.  I've spent my life looking at the night sky.  I've seen satellites and the space station several times and thousands of falling stars.  These things were dim L.E.D looking lights and they were longated.  They moved faster than anything man maid and they didnt make a sound.  I kinda wish that I wouldn't have seen them.   Did anyone else see them?  They were not hiding.  What does it mean?  Anyway they were not large crafts.   Please post if you seen them also.;39.2666406779661;-81.5268237288134
