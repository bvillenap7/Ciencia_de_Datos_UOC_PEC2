And the reason im posting this is because just the other night end of may 2010 I had a dream !  I was in my car it was night and one of my friends was driving but i didnt like it and we went into the interssection and all the power went out.  he said that he knew what it was and started to look up into the sky and the same time I felt a violent vibration on my ! body even effected my vision so violent....shaking me..and i felt myself being pulled in a thousand different ways ... like my particals being pulled a part moving up!
