Light hovering over tree top;2001-04-15 19:00:00;3 minutes;Light hovering over tree top Me and my aunt were driving north on route 52 going back to Princeton.  It was still early in the evening and she was driving and I was the first to notice the object hovering and moving very slowly across the top of the tree line I had my window down and there was know one else on the road.  I immediately turned down the radio and had her look at what I was seeing so we slowed down and could not hear anything from it we could not believe what we were seeing.  All we could see were 3 vertical lights that were very close together kind of like a vent.  I continued to watch it until it was out of sight.  And to this day, I have never forgotten that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));37.3748;-81.113947368421
Cobalt bue lightning like flashes near I-77 exit 9 at Princeton, WV.;2014-02-02 22:00:00;1 minute;Cobalt bue lightning like flashes near I -77 exit 9 at Princeton. Observed at least three powerful cobalt blue flashes of light behind a ridge between I-77 exit 9 and possible MM 11.  The flashes were noiseless and moved from north to south. The light event was preceded with blinkng table lamps, cable TV pixelation, house cat scratching to get in quickly at the main entry, and deep blue flashes reflecting on the southwest wall of the dining room coming in through the north facing patio doors. After stepping out onto the rear deck I could see the last of two flashes and determined that they were not associated with the usual power company outages since the color was not typical, the flashes were noiseless, and were actually moving at a high rate of speed.   I have been an electrical engineer for forty years and this event is not typical for a rural interstate that has no transmission lines around.;37.3748;-81.113947368421
