Back curved inward. no markings no sound. hovered above treeline Traveling south on Rt. 2 near the Market street bridge. Just before entering Follansbee, WV, Hovering just above the tree lines. A large black craft with 2 bright lights in front and 4 deep red lights. 2 of the red lights were centered on the bottom of the white lights. The other 2 lights were each side of the triange. There were no lights in the back of the craft which was bowed inward. The overall shape was that of a triangle that looked like the corners were cut off and the back was curved inward. There was no letters or writting on it anywhere. The bottom was smooth. Like it had no landing gear. I could not see any windows, or doors. I was very close to it. It was around 4:30 a.m. At first I thought it was an airplane, but it did not move. It made no noise. We slowed to watch it with the windows down. We went up on the hill to get a good look at it. The clearing showed the entire sky. The shy was clear. It just vanished. Nowhere in sight. I was not drinking or use drugs. Very clear of mind. There was another person in the car with me and my husband. My husband was sleeping. I can't find anything on the net that looks like this. How can it just vanish like that? Awsome. Could you please let me know if you know what this was.;40.3324;-80.585
