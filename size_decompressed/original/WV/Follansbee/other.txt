The Greatest Conspiracy on Earth Chapter 2 Tensions have escalated in the cell that the United States government has created around me cell is a term used for an operating government intelligence gather group.  The exact use of this intelligence can only be speculated.  Some things could be mentioned but this could be an act of treason.  So for now just use your imagination. As mentioned in the first document, aliens, me and GOD.  The assholes that I call them have become more aggressive towards me.  They have resorted to psychological devices. These devices use sound and cerebral techniques to alter my surroundings, which can be discomforting, but fuck them anyway.  Also, the hybrids on earth, which mask themselves in a matrix, are coordinating with the pure bloods in an all-out attempt to persuade me into an agreement of sorts.  The Matrix I believe is similar to the matrix in the movie LIVE, which stars Rowdy Rodney Piper. This agreement would be an acceptance of their right to dominate earth and its people.  I will not cooperate with them!  I know of other Alienâ€™s that have better intentions towards us and they are near or present now and more are coming.  This is the reasoning behind this assault.  I believe the new comers attacked the assholes. Ex. Lake Michigan, the Green Fog. This probably hid the craft at the bottom of Lake Michigan.  The other one was from god Ex. Mass corona ejection from the sun melted a craft near Venus. After these events their where two attempts to take my life, I survived only because I am super natural and god protected me.  They keep repeating to me, listen, and I will not listen to the assholes, because they are planet takers.  I only listen to my inner voice or conscience.  May GOD bless us and good luck!;40.3324;-80.585

Approximately 8:30 PM EST, my friend and I stepped outside for a smoke after dinner. We had just finished eating at my sister's house who I was visiting and lives on ((road name deleted)) Rd. on Hoverson Heights in Follansbee,WV. Niether one of us had any wine or any type of alcoholic beverage prior to or after dinner nor do either one of us use any type of controbane of any kind.  The location is atop a mountain in the West Virginia hills and very dimly lit. Shortly after lighting my cigarette I looked up to admire the clear skys and the stars when I noticed a very bright light up to my left (north). I raised my left hand pointed to it and said, damn, ((name deleted)) is that a star? He looked up to what was his right and said, not sure. I said, it's looks to bright to be a star. It was a large, round, bright light with a kind of stripe or some type of band around it. It began to fade straight back, away from us not across the sky and fade out as would a shooting star nor did it have any type of flashing lights and move across the sky as would an airplane. It simply faded away from us dimmer and dimmer until it was completely gone. I am a 54 year old man and must admit I never really believed in UFO sightings until tonight. I swear it was a very very strange experience and has me talking about it to everyone I can. I felt the need to report it because of it's validity. ((NUFORC Note:  International Space Station passed near Follansbee, WV, but at 20:03 hrs. (local), and it would have been visible to the south, not the north.  We do not know what the witnesses observed.
