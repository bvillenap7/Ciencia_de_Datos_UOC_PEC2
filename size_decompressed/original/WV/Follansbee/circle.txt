2 green lights hovering low maybe 85ft above the rd RT2N.;2017-09-24 19:00:00;2 minutes;2 green lights hovering low maybe 85ft above the rd RT2N 9/24/17 around 7pm.  My wife and I were traveling on RT2N, between the Market St Bridge and Veterans Bridge.  As I pass the Market St Bridge, I notice 2 small Green Lights hovering above the road, about 85ft up, just sitting there.  I drove directly underneath of it, both of us were leaned forward looking up at it.  It appeared to be about 5ft in diameter.   As I pass underneath and merge to get onto the Veterans bridge now heading E into Steubenville OH I am looking back at it the whole time.  As I get onto the bridge it starts moving slowly across the water maintaining its height traveling SE into OH.  I tried to slow down as much as possible without causing a safety issue with the traffic, until It was out of sight.  It was too big to be a personal drone.   No way our local small-town news has any type of weather drone of that significance.   Who knows, just super weird.  Coordinates of where it was hovering 40.376016, -80.603570 ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.  PD));40.3324;-80.585
