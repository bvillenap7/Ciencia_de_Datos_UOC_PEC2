An unidentified flying object (UFO) was spotted hovering near Williamson on Tuesday afternoon and there were several witnesses who watched it. The Williamson Daily News got several calls about the UFO which appeared southeast of downtown. The autumn sky was a clear, bright blue with sunshine. The first call came in from a railroad employee. He and several others saw it as they got off work around 3:00 p.m. Another call came in from a resident of West Williamson. Constructions workers at Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College in the West End of town also sighted the object. Another woman from the South Williamson area also said she spotted the UFO. A resident of the Valley View subdivision, which is south of Williamson, viewed the object through binoculars. She said the UFO appeared to be oblong and seemed to run vertical, rather than horizontally. Employees of the Williamson Daily News and City Tire, which is right across the street from their offices, saw the object hovering for well over an hour. Customers of the automotive repair business also saw the UFO. Heads were turned skyward toward the object. At times it appeared to get brighter. Several jets appeared to fly in the vicinity of the UFO.  Contrails could be seen zigzagging all around the object.  This made for much speculation by those who witnessed the strange, airborne object. Reports from Pike County also said the UFO was spotted near Elkhorn City and Pikeville, Ky. Facebook was alive with people commenting on the pictures that were uploaded.  It made for an interesting afternoon in and around Williamson.;37.6885;-82.2623
