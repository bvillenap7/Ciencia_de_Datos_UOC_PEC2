Five white dots at gret height sped away at incredible speed.;2016-08-15 13:00:00;1 minute;Five white dots at gret height sped away at incredible speed. My wife and I were standing outdoors, and looked up to see five white dots, stationary in a circle, at an apparently very great height.   As we watched, they circled, and one by one, took off to the southwest at a very great rate of speed.   The whole thing lasted less than a minute.   I happened to have cheap pair of binoculars, but these things were so high, I could see no detail.   I'm a commercial pilot and a lifelong aviation buff, and I can attest that these were some type of aircraft, at an extreme height, and moving at an incredible speed.   The weather was severe clear and blue skies.;38.0946;-81.7654
