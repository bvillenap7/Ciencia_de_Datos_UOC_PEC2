Four bright orange red lights in Shepherdstown, WV.;2013-08-17 21:10:00;5 minutes;Four bright orange red lights in Shepherdstown, WV We were driving across the bridge from Sharpsburg, MD, into Shepherdstown, WV, and as we weren't even off the bridge yet, we immediately saw these bright orange red balls or orbs in the night sky hovering & then gravitating slowly towards one like they were changing formation.   Very odd.  Even my six year daughter saw them from the backseat in the car.   It was eerie & very magical.;39.4297;-77.8143
