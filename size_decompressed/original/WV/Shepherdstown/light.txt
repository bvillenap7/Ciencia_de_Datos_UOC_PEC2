((anonymous report));1997-07-18 23:00:00;2 minutes;Summary : saw a bright white flashing (2 to 3 sec intervals) light in a field approx. 40 ft in the air. object was stationary. coming home from a fishing excursion on the potomac river, a thunderstorm was rolling in.   i noticed an unusally bright flash ahead of me to the right of the road.  the light appeared to be much brighter and whiter than the lightening in the sky at the time.  the light was stationary and flashing at regular intervals of approx. 2-3 seconds.  the light was flashing towards my car not in all directions.  i could not see the object producing the light but there is no known source to my knowledge that would produce this light in this field.  i feel certain that this was not a known aircraft common to this area.;39.4297;-77.8143
I saw a bright light outside of my window.;2008-02-05 06:00:00;45 min.;I saw a bright light outside of my window. I was looking out of my window and I saw a bright light in the sky.  It was too bright to be a star, or a plane.  I called over my dad, he of course said it was nothing, but I still thought what I saw was a UFO.  I decided to just forget about it.  But, I kept looking out the window to see if it was still there.   After about 45 minutes, it just disappeared.  Like a light switch going on and off.  And when it went away, there was like a... almost trail left behind it.  Like a light colored streak in the sky.;39.4297;-77.8143
