UFO over Shepherdstown, WV on 10/31/02;2002-10-31 22:30:00;5 minutes;UFO over Shepherdstown, WV on 10/31/02 I saw a craft similar to the picture - http://www.nuforc.org/S53138.jpg - hovering over Shepherdstown, WV, while traveling from Sharpsburg, MD, on Rt. 34 near the Antietam Battlefield.  It seemed to hover for about five minutes.  It was hazy out & the lights appeared to fade back up through the haze after a few minutes.  Assumed haze was normal, but on the MD side of the Potomac River (that seperates WV & MD in that area) was clear. However, I thought the red dot in the center might have been a plane, as the triangular lights appeared to move and rotate in synch, but I remember the red dot moving seperately.  The craft was at least as large as described in the picture, as it appeared over the town of Shepherdstown, WV, while I was about a mile away from where it would have been hovering. On a randon side note, there is a Government Wildlife Area that is fenced off, but does have an above ground facility (can't remember the name off hand).  When I just tried to find it on MapQuest, there is no reference to it. People in Shepherdstown report black helicopters and SUVs frequently, especially on 9-11-01. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD));39.4297;-77.8143
