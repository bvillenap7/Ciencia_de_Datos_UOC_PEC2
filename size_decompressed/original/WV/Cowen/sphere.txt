I saw a round blue, almost translucent sphere.  It was directly overhead, moving very fast over the house.  It was flying below the clouds, there were no flashing lights.  I ran into my house and went out the back door to the back porch and seen it moving extremely fast until I couldn’t see it anymore.  It took less than a minute.  There was no sound.  Since it was cloudy it couldn’t be a plane or helicopter or star;38.4168;-80.5343
