Then the ground shook, this i thought was a mine blast. A bright light lit up the skyi was very frightened, the light moved over my house and paused over the porch, which was on the other side of the wall as my room. I covered my eyes and looked out the window on the door adark figure appeared outside I was paralized. I closed my eyes and re opened them, I was floating above the headge outside my house. I looked up and saw an arangement of red,blue,yellow and, white lights. In the middle of the craft was a growing light then I noticed that it was a door I screamed, and woke up in my bed three days later, I still to this day can't remember what happened durring thoes three days. My only reminders of this incounter  are numerous scars, and horrable dreams. Three years ago I was taken to the hostpitial because of a car crash, whall there the doctors informed me of many small disc-shaped growths found through-out my body. The news of this brought the memory back and fromthat day till now I have been drawn to find out as much as I can. Sence then i have moved to Summersville in Nicholas County and I have begun to remember the incident. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate, source is anonymous.   PD));38.4168;-80.5343
