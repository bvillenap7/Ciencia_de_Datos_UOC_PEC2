Three-lighted triangular object, slow moving outside Huntington, West Virginia.;2004-05-08 02:00:00;5 mins;Three-lighted triangular object, slow moving outside Huntington, West Virginia. There were three lights triangular shaped in pattern that slowly moved across the night sky.  At first, we thought they were satellites, until the group of lights passed over a star and the star disappeared behind the shape.   Then we noticed the bottom was slightly illuminated against the background of the sky, but a lighter color than the sky.  The lights were steady, not blinking.  The object moved in a constant, slow direction across the sky similar to a satellite.  The front light was red, the back two white.  We watched until the object faded off into the distance.  The path it took was from left to right in our fields of view.;38.4544;-82.2185
