Sighting of a disk 3 times the size of an airplane in Gerrardstown, WV, near Martinsburg.;2015-04-12 22:30:00;Seconds;Sighting of a disk 3 times the size of an airplane in Gerrardstown, WV, near Martinsburg. Oval elongated craft spotted in southwest sky.  Traveling at a very high speed.  Seen by my son and a neighbor at another home in our development.  There was also a plane in the sky at the same time.  It was 3 times that size!   Before my son saw it, my dog began to growl and bark out the window.   We live near the mountain here and strange sightings are becoming frequent.   I am scared to death to think what this may be.   We are also a few miles away from a regional airport too.   Never believed until now.;39.3811;-78.1173
