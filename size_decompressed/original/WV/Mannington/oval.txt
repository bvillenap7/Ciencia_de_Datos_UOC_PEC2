I look up and an object that looked sort of like a half moon with something coming down off the front left side.  My kids said it looked like the moon, but the moon was behind us.  I parked the car ran out in the yard to get a picture and it was gone. The background was in a valley above a small damn that is a fishing club surrounded by hills.  No houses or businesses only a small clubhouse.  I did not get a picture and me and my two children are the only witnesses that I know of.;39.522;-80.3552
