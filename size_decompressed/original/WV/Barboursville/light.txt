We were camping out at a friends house, getting off the trampoline, when one of us looked to the sky.  When we all looked up, and saw a blue, about 1-2mile long light.  It disappeared about 30 seconds afterwards.  It kept appearing and reappearing every 30seconds to 1 minute.  We heard a wierd sound, and it flashed across the sky.  One of the kids looked at the moon, and reported it growing.;38.3864;-82.299
