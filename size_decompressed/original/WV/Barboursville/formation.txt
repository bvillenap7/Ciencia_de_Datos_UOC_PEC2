We drove to next exit turned around went back and they were gone. I was driving and we were on our way back from Bowen's Ridge Church near Huntington, and I saw 6 golden colored lights on the horizon to our left and pointed it out to the others. The lights looked like they were in a lop sided diamond shape and they went over the road from left to right of us.  As we got beside they were above West Pea Ridge Barboursville beside exit 15 off 64.  They were golden colored bright and spreading out moving up and down and just hovering about 500 to 1000 yards diagonally to us in the sky.  By the time we pulled off the highway they were behind the trees.  We went to the exit 18 turned around went back and they were gone.;38.3864;-82.299
