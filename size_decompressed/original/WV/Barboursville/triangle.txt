We noticed an orange triangular shaped light hover in the sky over our campsite at Beechfork State Park campground.  It did not make any noise.  We have no idea how long it had been there.   After we spotted it, it lingered for about 4 minutes and slowly moved across the sky.  We watched it move away for approximately another 6 minutes.   A white round object flew across the sky and met it in the air.  Together, they disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
