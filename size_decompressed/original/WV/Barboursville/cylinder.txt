Fast moving cylinder object vanishes into sky.;1985-06-19 20:30:00;5 Seconds;Fast moving cylinder object vanishes into sky. My wife and I were walking along a street in Barboursville, WV's, Linmonte area.  It was cloudly and recently stopped raining.  I glanced up and seen this grey cylinder shaped object coming straight up from behind a hill at a very fast speed.  It made no noise at all, but seemed to have a haze around it.  I pointed to it as my wife looked the top of the object stopped moving but the bottom kept going and it vanished.  The entire duration of the event lasted about 5 seconds.   An odd feeling come about my wife, and I after the event we then walked back home. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Mr. Davenport,   that was an error of mine in the date. It was in fact 2011, I was in a rush to get it to you so i wouldn't forget the details. Please take note it was 2011 not 1985. Thank you ((END ADDENDUM));38.3864;-82.299
