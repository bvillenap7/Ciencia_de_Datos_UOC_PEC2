I was jogging at a local park after dark and saw two objects moving slowing towards each other.  I thought they were planes but it was odd.  They made no sound.  Both objects got closer and appeared to mere then a blue flash to the ground and there was nothing there.  The flash seemed to hit something over a mountain because there was a flash. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, I saw the objects about 15 minutes but what’s weird is that after the flash is stopped and the next thing I know is that my watch timer went off indicating 40 minutes lapsed @ 8 minute mile.  I only went 3 miles so I don’t think the objects for 25 minutes stationary?  There were other people that had have seen what I saw as well.  I thought the objects collided in mid air but there’s nothing on the news about a mid air collision. ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));38.3864;-82.299
