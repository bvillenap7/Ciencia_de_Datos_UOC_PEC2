The time was 12:20am it was a warm cloudy night. While walking my husband and I spotted a bright oval that had a hazy glow to it, the object was about 20 feet away from us and it went between some trees.  The object was very large and moved quite fast, the object moved very fast and landed somewhere in the neighborhood.  I went with my husband to look for the object but could not find where it landed, when we returned home I could hear buzzing noises and I seen hazy silhouettes moving in the trees.
