intense blue light on route 10 between davis creek mountain and barboursville(rural area);2003-08-08 00:15:00;4 minutes;intense blue light on route 10 between davis creek mountain and barboursville(rural area) my mother and i was driving north on state route 10 just a few miles past Davis Creek Mountain and on our left around the hillside we could see a super bright blue flashing light that lit up the entire valley between the hills that we were driving through.  at first we thought it was an emergency vehicle, but i quickly relized it was way too bright for just strobe lights on a police car or fire truck.  we never actually saw the craft but the light was so intense, and i am sure there were no man made light sources in the area that could emit that much light.  then as we aproached barboursville, toward route 60, i saw a small flash maybe distant flash over the hill to my left which would have been the western sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, according to the witness, although we do not understand that aspect of the report, since the report was submitted on the same date that the alleged sighting occurred.

UFO during the eclipse.;2017-08-21 03:10:00;1 second;UFO during the eclipse August 21, 2017, on August 21, 2017, at approximately 3:10pm, during the Eclipse, I saw what looked to be UFO in nature.  I was watching the eclipse, the moon was almost completely done with covering the sun.   As I was watching the last of the eclipse, I noted, and so did my husband, a usually odd shape flying what looked like in between the Moon and Sun.  It was long in shape and looked to have wings.  It looked like it was going extremely fast and I only saw it for a few seconds, if that.  It looked black in color and was long and thin and looked like it had wings. Both me and my husband saw it at the same time.;38.3864;-82.299
