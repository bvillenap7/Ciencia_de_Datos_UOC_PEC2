It appeared to have red and blue lights flashing with them.  The sky was clear and the view was clear and unobstucted I called my son's girlfriend to observe and she too witnessed these objects.  At times they would appear to disappear and reappear again.  They moved rapidly, but staying within one area of the sky.  At one point, they seemed to omit smaller lights in rapid formation coming from one of them.  I was only glad that I had another eye witness to this event as I would have thought my eyes were playing tricks on me.  I do not know what they were, but I know what we saw and it was not what one sees normally i'n the sky.  I hope this helps in some way. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Capella??
