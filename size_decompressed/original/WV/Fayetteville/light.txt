Exactly south (compass) from our location sitting on the guardrail and it was glowing red and remaining in the same spot or a few minutes the it would shift.  It juat vanished.   Then 2 more appeared about 2 minutes later, before the fireworks even began.  They hovered for quite awhile then they darted about 30 feet and stopped again.  They remained after the fireworks began but completely vanishe within 5 minutes of beginning.  They glowed green and changed to red just before they vanished.;38.0654;-81.0953
A star-like light appeared to be flying for approximately 13-14 seconds before pulsing two bright bluish-white lights and then vanished;2015-08-27 21:00:00;15 seconds;A star-like light appeared to be flying for approximately 13-14 seconds before pulsing two bright bluish-white lights and then vanished At approximately 9:00pm Thursday, August 27, 2015, I happened to be smoking a cigarette on my front porch, when I noticed a light similar to that of a distant star, but yet was moving.  I thought it may have been what at first, seemed  to be a high altitude jet flying over the New River Gorge area, yet the more I observed the object it appeared to be flying at a more than normal rate of speed and DID NOT have any flashing light as, you would see with most terrestrial aircraft.   As I walked out into the driveway to watch it further a bright bluish white light flashed twice in intervals over one second exactly apart before vanishing leaving no trace, nor light.  This entire observation lasted only fifteen second before simply vanishing in the sky.  It did not leave in one direction or the other, only ceased to be there.;38.0654;-81.0953
