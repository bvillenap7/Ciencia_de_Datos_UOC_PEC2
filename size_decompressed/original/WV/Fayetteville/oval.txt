Bright yellow light above Fayetteville, seen for a couple years in a row.;2015-07-17 01:00:00;30 seconds;Bright yellow light above Fayetteville, seen for a couple years in a row. Me and a couple friends came home from a party around one am.  We were laying in bed, when all of a sudden my friend jumped over top of me and yelled, pointing out the window so I looked over.   A yellow bright light was in the sky, about as high as power poles, maybe 50 feet from our window.  We watched it for a second before it disappeared around the side of the house.  It went slow at first and then shot off.  We immediately closed the window.   This year, around the same time, another friend was here and he saw it come up to the window.  We all did.   The light was so bright we couldn't tell how big it was.  My friends parents even saw it too.  But nobody else ever believes us.;38.0654;-81.0953
