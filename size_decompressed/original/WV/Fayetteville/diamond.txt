Orange sphere following family of four;2011-07-06 21:00:00;20 min;orange sphere following family of four around nine pm my oldest son was playing at a friends house in the front yard and my son was 11yrs old at the time and he noticed an object hovering about 40 ft away at the same height as the telephone pole is at, first he said it looked like a parachute with a orange ball attached to it  but as it came closer he said it was a solid looking object and at that moment my wife pulled up to pick him up and she also noticed it and made him get in the car with her and my other son and they left  heading home and the object follwed the car at a speed of around 35mph hovering out from the drivers side at the height of the telephone poles, my wife said the car kept running but the lights went out and she noticed that the orange ball was pulsating rapidly so she increased her speed but it kept up with her until they pulled into the driveway where it just hovered above the car so they got out of the car and my oldest son ran in and got me and as i came out it shot straight up through the clouds leaving a ring in the clouds, now i served in the army for six years and have seen all kinds of aircraft and i have used flares this was NOT man made i believe this was a probe of some kind because my son and his friend said it just sat there watching them for about 10min, i have perfect eye sight and i consider myself and my family rational and honest people, this was not of this world...;38.0654;-81.0953
