I immediately saw a triangle shaped bay of solid non-pulsating non-flashing red lights.  The object appeared to be triangular in shape but was not well illuminated.  The object appeared to be 500 to 1000 feet over the end of her street (approximately 100 yds. south of my position).  It was slowly moving towards my position.  There was no noise, no odor, no sensation of heat or any other perception other than the visual. 	I called for her to hurry and come out of the garage.  This took her approximately 45 sec. to 1 min.  During that period of time the object pivoted 120 degrees towards the southeast and up-angled at about 60 degrees.  It silently accelerated away in that direction.  My girl friend came out of the garage and videoed a point of red light moving away.  She only saw the object once it was so distant that the three lights could only be distinguished as one. We watched the object disappear up and away from us.  The whole incident took 3 to 5 min. 	I ask her neighbor and friend, who is a state police officer, if this was perhaps a drug plane using infrared.  He stated they do use infrared but it is not visible.  Meigs County across the river is infamous for growing marijuana. 	I have since been told that several other people in the neighboring town of Hartford saw something similar but I don't know their names. 	The Mason County airport is about 15 miles south of where this occurred in Point Pleasant, WV.;38.9877;-81.9625
