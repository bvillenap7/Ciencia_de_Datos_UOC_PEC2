Disk shaped object sited over Mason County W.V. traveling at high rate of speed.;2000-10-12 17:40:00;6 seconds;Disk shaped object sited over Mason County W.V. traveling at high rate of speed. We were getting ready to watch a parade on main street when we saw a Cessna 172 private aircraft. While we were watching it when we noticed a round object much higher than the plane, looked like maybe 25k or 30k msl traveling from West to East at a very high rate of speed. It was only visible for approx. 6 seconds then it was gone. The object looked as though it was reflecting the sunlight. I don't know who the others were beside me at the time. I myself am a Private Pilot, 53 years old,U.S. Army Veteran and have lived here in New Haven all my life. I work as an Electrical-Electronic-Maintainer at an Aluminum production plant here in West Virginia.;38.9877;-81.9625
