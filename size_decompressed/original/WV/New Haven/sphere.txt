This object was orange in color and started as a small dot, about the size of this 'o', just above the horizon over a power plant. We were out in the country away from lights, except from the power plant, and the sky was clear. I spotted the object first and noticed that it was slowly rising in the sky. I pointed it out to my cousin because we both had telescopes growing up and I knew he would help confirm that this small, glowing dot was actually moving. We watched the object slowly rise about 2 inches from the point I first spotted it, and it also started to grow larger in diameter, and shone more brightly. The object then seemed to blink out and reappear a second later 3 hills over above the horizon. It was brighter and larger than it was when it was visible a second ago. The whole disappear and reappear took place in a blink of an eye. When it reappeared, it moved quickly up in the sky and vanished again. I have done hours of sky watching and seen many different types of 'shooting stars' so I know what the look like. It was the disappearing of the object that really freaked us out. I have never seen a shooting star disappear, reappear, and move the opposite direction and disappear again. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  PD));38.9877;-81.9625
