Black disc shaped object bounced around and vanished.;2019-04-13 19:45:00;3 minutes;Black disc shaped object bounced around and vanished. I was on a commercial aircraft above central West Virginia.  We were at an altitude of 32,000 feet at a speed of about 400 mph at sunset.  Some clouds in distance and craft was in front of those clouds.  It looked to be at least 20 miles away.  It seemed to move and stop.  Then it disappeared and reappeared in a different place.  I took two pictures with my Android phone.  The craft seems very small but can be seen stationary in 1st pic and moving in 2nd pic.;38.4766;-81.0711
