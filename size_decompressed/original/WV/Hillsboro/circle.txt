It attracted my attention because it did not move, not at all.  I got binoculars, could see no details other than large and bright red. Had dinner, along one with guests. Object still there.  It had not moved an inch. Looking with glasses it started upward slowly at frist and very fast as it dissipeared.  Are there other sightings of this type? ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1973 is approximate.  We wonder if this is a hoax report, alluding cryptically to the Sun in the daytime sky, although we recognize that the Sun does not move swiftly across the sky and suddenly disappear.  Witness does not indicate whether he managed to obtain a photograph during the some four hours he witnessed the object.  PD));38.1137;-80.2672
