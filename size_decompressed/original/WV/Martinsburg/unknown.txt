Lights go from very dim to extremely bright As we were sitting on our dock on the Potomac river near the small town of Bedington, WV we observed numerous small and medium white lights that traveled in the same pattern. We have watched these events for over 5 years. These lights sometimes seem to get extremely bright, almost like an afterburner on a jet fighter. They are extremely high in the sky and the lights do NOT blink. They are steady and there is no sound. They travel at an extreme speed. We have ruled out the passenger plane theory, even though we are in the flight path for Dulles airport in Virginia because of the strange movements these objects sometimes make. They never change color, the light just goes from very dim to very bright. I cannot tell you the shape because of the height they were traveling and the fact it was dark. We have tried to video tape these lights but they are simply too high in the sky to show up on video. We would love to fing someone close to where we live to do a little more research on what these strange, fast and nimble crafts are. I would appreciate any info you can provide as I feel we are watching the UFO highway above our house, which is located in the country!! So perfect for watching events like these.;39.4721473214285;-77.9504437500001
huge blue light 50-80 feet wide in sky that lasted 3-6 seconds.;2010-10-09 04:00:00;6 seconds;huge blue light 50-80 feet wide in sky that lasted 3-6 seconds. I was driving from Inwood, WV toward Martinsburg, WV, when my friend and I saw a blue light light up the sky.  The light was kind of far away and was brighter in the center and got lighter going outwards.  The light span in the sky was probably 50-80 feet wide.  It appeared for about 3 seconds, went dark again for 2 seconds, and lit up again for about 2 seconds.   Power in Hedgesville, WV, had went out around the same time and the power company had no clue what happened.
