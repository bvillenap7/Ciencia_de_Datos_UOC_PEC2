floating disc, numerous quick course changes,  shortly afterwards aircraft seeming to grid search area.;1973-07-20 19:00:00;5 - 10 minutes;floating disc, numerous quick course changes,  shortly afterwards aircraft seeming to grid search area. Approx. 1971/1974 early eve.6 - 7 pm & towards the end of summer.   Myself, sister & friend, were playing.  As we exhausted ourselves with summer play, knowing in a very short time our mothers would call us in for the night.  We lay on the front lawn giggling, and staring at the early evening sky.   We then noticed a large, typical disc shaped object, silvery in color.  It made unusual movements, floated near and far within seconds, then would suddenly fly off into a direction, stop hover, and again change altitudes and direction like I have never seen since.    Within minutes several Air Force jets (?) along with a couple helicopters appeared which seemed to fly in a searching grid type pattern.   Just prior to them showing up the disc moved westward toward the mountains.   I've never spoken of this & would like to research further, I.E.  A more precise timeframe, newspaper articles, and or sightings by others, along with any cooberating info.  I know what I saw, I'm a professional, owning a business for 15 yrs.   This has haunted me for years. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));39.4721473214285;-77.9504437500001
