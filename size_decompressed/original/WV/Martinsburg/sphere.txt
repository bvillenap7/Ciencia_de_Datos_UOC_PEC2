I looked up and a stationary round object opened up on the bottom and out came a bright beam that was like a spotlight and it got wider/expanded and brighter over seconds  towards the ground then suddenly flashed at each 15 minute points of the clock then got spotlight shape again slowly widening and brightening at the same time, then slowly got thinner as it was  fading slowly away then it seemed as if it ascended extremly fast into the clouds as if the  clouds just sucked it up.then a plane took off from the airport and circled the area around where  the object was.;39.4721473214285;-77.9504437500001

I was driving into work this morning and looking at the beautiful clear full moon when a large white sphere appeared right next to the moon.  It was huge--way too big to be a star or an plane.   I watched for about a minute and decided to stop and take a picture.  When I got out to take the picture, it totally just disappeared.;39.4721473214285;-77.9504437500001
