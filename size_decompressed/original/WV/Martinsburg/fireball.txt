Weird ball of light falling to the ground.;2014-08-03 21:30:00;15 seconds;Weird ball of light falling to the ground My husband and I were sitting on our back deck enjoying a cigar and a cup of coffee, discussing our plans for this week.   We have a large hill behind our house along with a few other homes.  We have a lot of planes that pass over our house due to the military air base next door, I always enjoy looking up at the different planes going by.  I happened to notice a small plane passing over but as it just went by the corner of my eye straight over the hill was what looked like a fireball falling rapidly.   It was all white and no red or orange or yellow. but looked as if an object was falling to the ground.  I saw no more as it either became fizzled out, disappeared or actually made contact with the ground.   Right before we saw this object we had taken our puppy inside because he was trying desperately to get back into the house, whining, clawing and scratching at the sliding glass door.  He loves the outdoors but for some reason he did not want to be outside at all. Just weird.;39.4721473214285;-77.9504437500001
