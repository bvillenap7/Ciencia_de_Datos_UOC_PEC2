I was outside smoking a cigarette and I usually like to look at star formations. I looked out off of my porch out over a large hill, and 2 cigar shaped objects came up over the hill probably 1600 meters out. Not off of the ground, but more like over the horizon.  Being military, I have seen some weird things, and never believed in UFO's.  However, this was amazing.  They moved slowly, and then would jump straight up probably 2 or 3 hundred meters, then would come back together. it had greenish blue lights, and id say i could count about 10 or so lights on the side facing me on each of them.  It lasted about 6 or 7 minutes, and then they went beyond the hill, and I couldn't see them. I ran inside to get a video camera hoping they would come back, but they didn't. When I was stationed at Fort Hood Texas, we saw a few weird things in the sky, but nothing ever like this. we always thought it was people doing night training..but this is not Fort Hood, and I'm not aware of any night training missions around here. I thought I would say something. I hope this helps..;39.4721473214285;-77.9504437500001
