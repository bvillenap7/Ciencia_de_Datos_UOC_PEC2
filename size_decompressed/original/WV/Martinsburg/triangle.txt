Had three flashing bluish/white lights that flashed in a counter-clockwise triangle. I, who was 13 at the time, and a friend who was 14 were camping out under the stars in my back yard. It was a mostly clear night with a full moon and some scattered high cirrus clouds. My friend saw the object first and immediately pointed it out to me. It was three strobe-like lights flashing in a counter-clockwise triangle. It was moving very fast across the sky from north to south. It passed over the scattered cirrus clouds, so I estimate it must have been above 50,000 feet in altitude. It would move irratically from side to side and diagonal while maintaining it's forward (southerly) course. It was as if it was actually jumping like a water bug. Since it was at least 50,000 feet in altitude, I estimate when it jumped it was jumping at least a couple of miles at a time. We observed the object until it cleared our horizon (until we could no longer see it). It was moving too fast for me to even run and get my telescope out of the house. It cleared our horizon in about 45 seconds time. A passenger jet at altitude takes nearly five minutes to clear our horizon. Taking that into consideration, this thing must have been moving at thousands of miles per hour. It didn't leave a contrail of any kind and it made no sound. I never actually seen the body of the object all I could see was the lights, so I'm assuming it was shaped like a triangle because of the pattern of the lights. The lights were not very bright -- they were like a strobe in the sense that they flashed similarly to a strobe but they were much softer then strobes. They were bright enough to see through the cirrus clouds when passing above them. I called the local Air National Guard and they refered me to a UFO reporting line, which I called and reported to. They seemed quite interested in my observation. I have never seen this object or anything similar since. It was a very exciting night for a couple of young teenagers. As for backgrounds, we were just normal kids. I am thankful that we were able to see such an awesome sight. I will never forge! t it.;39.4721473214285;-77.9504437500001
A triangular metalic UFO exhibiting no vapor trail was spotted in the vicinity of two commercial aircraft.;2000-09-16 07:12:00;1-2 minutes;A triangular metalic UFO exhibiting no vapor trail was spotted in the vicinity of two commercial aircraft. Two commercial airplanes were flying east to southeast following a flight pattern we've frequently seen.  Another unidentified flying object appeared at first to the rear and below the two commercial aircraft.  The commercial aircrafts emitted a clearly visible vapor trail.  The UFO did not.  The UFO seemed to be flying faster than the commercial aircraft due to the fact that it appeared to pass the commercial aircraft.  After watching all aircrafts for about a minute we took our eyes off of it to check the time.  When we looked up again the UFO had disappeared but the two commercial aircrafts were still visible.;39.4721473214285;-77.9504437500001
Triagular object hovering overhead;2008-12-14 20:30:00;5 minutes;Triagular object hovering overhead About 8:30 PM EST, my daughter and I were outside.  A triangle shaped light pattern, made up of 3 lights at the tips and one in the center, flew in from the west.   Once directly overhead, it was easy to see the triangular shape of the object.  I thought it was a plane or jet at first, but it seemed to hover overhead and none of the lights were flashing like ordinary aircraft.   After a couple of minutes directly overhead, it performed a U-turn and head back towards the western horizon.
