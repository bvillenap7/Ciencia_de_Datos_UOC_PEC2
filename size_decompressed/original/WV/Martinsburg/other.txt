We were north of Martinsburg headed toward the Potomac River bridge crossing into Maryland.  It was twilight.  My wife first saw the configeration of lights to our northeast (at about 45 degrees), then I saw it.  It looked like a chandelier of evenly spaced lights, two tiered with perhaps five lights visible on the top tier and perhaps four lights on the bottom.  The object just hovered, then it disappeared.  I saw it for maybe 20 seconds my wife saw it a bit longer.  There may have been a wisp of exhaust/smole/cloud where it had been.  We both were dumbfounded. I am a retired Dept. of Defense research analyst with training in missile and space systems, but I have never viewed anything like this in my 39-year career.

Two red, slow-moving, circular lights suddenly become star-like and and blends into the night sky.;2014-09-27 20:30:00;90 seconds;Two red, slow-moving, circular lights suddenly become star-like and and blends into the night sky. I would like to preface my report by saying that I do not associate UFO sightings with aliens from outer space who have human-like proclivities.  In fact I am more inclined to believe that what I saw was probably a secret American aircraft.  This is what I saw:  On Saturday, September 27, 2014, at around 8:50pm, I saw two circular red lights moving slowly in the sky of Martinsburg, West Virginia.  The lights were far enough apart, and were moving slowly enough to lead me to believe they belonged to an aircraft preparing to land.  There is a military air base around here, so I was accustomed to seeing slow-moving aircraft move in in this fashion.  However, I did think it a bit odd that a) I did not actually see the plane, which I should have seen at the distance (the objects were not very high, and practically over my head) and b) I did not hear the drone of the engine.  As I watched the lights slowly approach I expected to hear the drone of the engines at a! ny minute.  Instead suddenly the lights dimmed, one at a time, and then disappeared and in their place I saw what looked like two stars twinkle brightly, and then it was over.  There was something very strange about how the red lights suddenly became stars that blended into the night.  In fact, I could have sworn that one of the red lights put some quick distance between itself and the other just as they switched from red lights to twinkling stars.;39.4721473214285;-77.9504437500001
