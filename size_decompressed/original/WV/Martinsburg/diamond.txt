It was something totally different . it defied the laws of  nature! The craft was between 150 To 200 feet in the air moving maybe 25 to 30 mph.  It was going so slow it should have dropped out of the sky.It made no noise.  It had 4 lights. No lights were blinking. It had a charcoal black color to it sorte like the color of a stealth fighter jet.  It may have been 30 to 40 feet wide in all directions.  It was diamond shape but it was more a Square shape.  It flew almost parallel with the road I was on . It came right over top my car! I got out of my car and watched it make a banking turn while it almost came to a stop. this was rt 9 (edwin miller blvd) rd in Martinsburg WV.  It flew right over top of arbys . Then it flew southeast for a while till it went out of view.;39.4721473214285;-77.9504437500001
Diamond shaped object with orange flashing lights;2014-09-25 08:38:00;2 minutes;diamond shaped object with orange flashing lights I saw a diamond shaped object directly above the emergency room at veterans hospital.  When I first saw it it looked flat and then it turned and became very narrow and then just disappeared before I could get a picture;39.4721473214285;-77.9504437500001
