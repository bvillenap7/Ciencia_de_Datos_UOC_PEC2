They manuvered very strangly they could change direction without changing speed and could move forewards and in reverse with ease. They could move side to side and take a 90 degree turn without the nose turning. It was the strangest thing I have ever seen passing over my house several times. And there was a strange haze when they were closer.;39.4721473214285;-77.9504437500001

The first night it had happened, I was sitting in the chair, and looked to the west where my best friend lives on the otherside of the development.  There in the sky was a VERY HUGE BRIGHT LIGHT, it looked as if it was white with a orangish glow around it.   At first, I thought it was a star, but when it started to get closer to the horizon, I knew it was not.  It was there for almost 10mins and then it was gone, not faded away, but gone. Now, the next night, it happened again, same way, same area.  It looks like it is over the farm's field, who has cattle and other farm animals. This has been happing every night at the same hour, and same duration.  I want to know what this is, I have even called my best friend and asked her on her days off to go and see what she can see, but the next time it happens, I will try to get a better look.;39.4721473214285;-77.9504437500001
Very green light appeared and fell straight down.;2013-10-02 20:05:00;2 seconds;Very green light appeared and fell straight down I saw a very green light appear while looking due east (we are in between Martinsburg and Hedgesville)  It fell downward.  It looked like something fell out of the sky.  It may have been a meteorite, but it didn't have a long tail, and it just appeared, not streaked.  A few seconds afterward, there were aircraft flying nearby. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));39.4721473214285;-77.9504437500001
