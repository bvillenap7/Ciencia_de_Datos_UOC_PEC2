I was standing on the back deck, smoking a cigarette, when I was compelled to keep looking at an unusual colored star that looked teal in color.  I kept hollering in the house to come look at this star how bright and beautiful in color then about 30 seconds later it started to die in color where I could make out the Aurora shake and it was a teal diamond hexagon shape craft or object slowly flying through the sky about half the shy length it just shot so fast I could not believe it as in the process  I went inside and got my wife and her nephew to take a look so whatever it was couldn't be explained but only one thing extraterrestrial ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
