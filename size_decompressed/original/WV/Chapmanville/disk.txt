It was a very pretty night out as my girlfriend and I Were outside just hangout on the swing. I was showing her the constellations and where they where located.  As I went to point out what I thought was the international space station we noticed a very fast moving object .As we are watching this object it zipped behind a mountain an we thought that was that. Well was I wrong next thing we know we hear like a firecracker wick burning sound and as quick as I could blink this craft what was a oval saucer with a rotating light underneath it is setting right in front of us about 100 Feet in the air.  As this craft shot in front of us it knocked the power our from everyone around us.  The whole 3 minutes it sat and what seemed like observing us we are looking in amazement knowing what we are witnessing is a UFO.  Well we hear the wick sound again then a super loud boom it takes off gliding like a well thrown paper airplane no other sound than the wick burning and loud boom did it ever make as it leaves the area we were in the power was ! restored in the instant it took off .  Well we are at the local Walmart about july 28th and a security guard who works there actually overheard us telling some friends about it and interrupted us and ask when this was we said about the beginning of the month she said  I bet that it was the same one that knock our power and backup generator out on july 13th annd I’m being completely honest the women had a picture of the exact craft we had seen the exact day we seen it plus the Walmart is only 3 miles away from where we were.  I’d like to speak vocally with someone ad I can describe it better in that way than writing it like this .  Thank you for your time.;37.9729;-82.0206
