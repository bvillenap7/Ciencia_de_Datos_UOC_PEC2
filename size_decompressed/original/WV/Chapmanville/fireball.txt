Fiery looking sphere moving very slowly.  I couldn't hear any noise like a plane or chopper would make. It moved straight up and disappeared.  It came back down, but another one came down right behind it. They were just moving around in that one spot.  Then one dimmed the lights, or something and I could barely see the outline of a triangular object with rounded edges spinning like a boomerang.  Then it disappeared again!;37.9729;-82.0206
