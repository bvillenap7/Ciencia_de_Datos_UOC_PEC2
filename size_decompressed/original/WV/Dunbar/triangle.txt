We noticed an object behind us in the sky and realized it was not a plane or helicopter.  We watched this object, and decided we would follow it.  We drove around the area as it moved around in approximately a 1 mile radius.  We then noticed it looked like it was on Pinewood Drive so we headed up the hill onto Pinewood.  At the top of the hill where the Leonard's lived at the time, there was a tree right beside their house on the right.  As we got to the top of the hill we observed a triangle shaped object, with lights in the shape similar to a Mercedes symbol flying right on/in the tree.  It did not make any sound and we were within 30 feet of this object.  We both said OMG and my boyfriend did a u-turn and it was gone.
