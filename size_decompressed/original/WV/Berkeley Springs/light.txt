While stairing at the stars, I noticed a line to the west of us of airplanes flying into DC direction, but a little later directly North of us, I was looking to the stars and noticed a very slow moving star.  Thinking it was just a satellite, like you can see a star-like object moving at times, but this one got brighter.  When I pointed it out, it kept getting brighter and bigger.  It past directly over us and we kept watching it.  There were no lights blinking on it just a very bright light that was no longer just a star.  We continued to watch it and it then moved toward the stars and then vanished south of us, where we could not even see a faint light either.  It was topic of discussion all night and I even stayed out longer to see if it came back  it never did come back.  I wish I knew what it was.;39.5515999999999;-78.1846999999999
