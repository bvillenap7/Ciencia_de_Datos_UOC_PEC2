Large object with rotating blue-ish white lights hovering above mountain in middle of nowhere.;2014-05-20 04:15:00;10 minutes;Large object with rotating blueish white lights hovering above mountain in middle of nowhere. Was on a mountain road around 4:15 AM, and as I got about 2/3 mile down it, I looked out across the valley and saw a circular set of lights rotating or flashing rapidly on the next mountain top over from my position.   They were covering the area of about one and a half football fields and were stationary, just hovering.   Size of the object about these lights was large (could tell from the way the stars and sky were blocked out.)   I watched for about ten minutes, then it occurred to me I was sitting there with my head lights on and could be seen as well so I drove off. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Forgot to add to my previous report that the circular lights object was eight miles or north of Rupert. ((END ADDENDUM));37.9685;-80.6696
