UFO with orange light in a hurry to get somewhere.;2015-08-03 00:30:00;Seconds;UFO with orange light in a hurry to get somewhere. I was driving on Rt. 60 heading home from work.  In between the neighborhoods of Rupert and Crawley, I saw an orange dot in the sky.  I at first dismissed as a star.   This object started moving closer toward me and got close enough to where I could tell there was some sort of structure around it.   It makes a sudden turn and goes east very quickly and vanishes from my site.;37.9685;-80.6696
