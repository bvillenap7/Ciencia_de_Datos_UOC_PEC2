unidentified object appeared to be following contrail of jet airplane;2008-09-18 18:40:00;5 minutes;unidentified object appeared to be following contrail of jet airplane It was a nice clear evening with no clouds and I was out for a walk.  I had just looked at my watch and noticed that it was 6:45 p.m. and then my eyes were drawn to the sky where there was what looked like a short contrail from a jet.  But what was unusual and really got my attention was an object that seemed to be following the same general direction of the contrail, but it's speed varied.  It was so far away I couldn't tell if it was another jet or something else, but there was no contrail or anything around it.  I took a picture with my digital camera and I can't tell if it is one or two objects behind the contrail.  (See photo attached.);38.7914;-81.3312
