On the night of September 2, 2011 at approximately 9:00 p.m.  The night was clear the object I witnessed was a bright light with a smaller light atop it.  This object was traveling in a south easterly direction I stepped out to smoke and just like every night I look toward the sky.  The difference in this night was that I saw a bright light in the sky moving erratically and going fast then slowing down.  This object had no sound or flashing lights as seen on other air craft which fly much higher than this object was. I watched it travel in a south easterly direction for approximately one minute at this time it vanished behind the tree line.  I also shouted for my wife to look at the same object she agreed that it did not appear to be a plain or chopper.
