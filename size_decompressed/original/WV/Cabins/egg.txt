There no pivacy restrictions While vacationing in West Virginia on 06-04-02, I was taking pictures of a vertical rock cliff in front of our rental cottage, I lost my balance and snapped a shot of the sky by accident.  I was using a digital camera and I had my laptop with me. That evening I downloaded the pictures I took into my computer. To my astonishment the accidental shot of the sky was not just the clouds. There appeared to be a very strange and unexpected object which in the cloudes. It appeared to be a UFO or possibly some kind of orb. My wife and I were flabergasted to see this. It is interesting to note that were not far from some of the secret government areas. I also am interested in getting some feedback on this. <p> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness forwarded digital image to NUFORC, and we have examined it.  It may be refracted light from a droplet of water on the objective lense of the camera, but that is a guess.  The object's image in the photo is diaphonous, and does not exhibit any really substantial, solid image.  PD));38.9512;-79.2783
