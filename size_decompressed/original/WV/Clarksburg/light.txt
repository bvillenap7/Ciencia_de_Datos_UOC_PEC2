STRANGE MOVING LIGHTS...;2011-06-25 22:00:00;then to current;STRANGE MOVING LIGHTS... WE WERE GETTING INTO THE CAR AFTER WATCHING A MOVIE AT MEADOWBROOK MALL IN CLARKSBURG/BRIDGPORT WV,   MY SON POINTS TO THE SKY,  AND I LOOK UP AND I SEE A LIGHT MOVING SLOWLY ALONG THE SKY,ALMOST LIKE A MOVING STAR, OR SATELLITE BUT,  IT WAS MOVING BACK AND FORTH ZIG ZAG AND CIRCULAR MOTIONS.  THERE WERE NO FLASHING LIGHTS OR BLINKING. SOLID ORANGE PINKISH COLOR.   WE CALLED THE LOCAL NEWS STATION, AND THEY WOULD LOOK IN TO IT.  I ASKED SOMEONE TO COME OUT TO RECORD IT, AND THEY ASKED WHY I DIDN'T RECORD IT ON MY PHONE AND I SAID I TRIED BUT THE PHONE WOULDN'T PICK UP AN IMAGE.  I SPOKE TO A MAN IN THE PARKING LOT AND TOLD HIM TO LOOK AT IT.  HE SAW IT MOVING AS WELL, BUT SAID ITS LIKE A STAR OR AIRPLAIN OR SOMETHING.   THE NEWS STATION NEVER CAME AND THE FOG ROLLED IN HEAVY AND NOW WE ARE LOOKING ON LINE FOR ANSWERS, OR MAYBE TO REPORT THIS.
