Large Disc hovering over a National Guard Armoy for 2 minutes then gone.;1985-05-15 20:00:00;2 minutes;Large Disc hovering over a National Guard Armoy for 2 minutes then gone. (I know this was a long time ago, but I still remember very well)   I was a a tough man contest in Clarksburg WV and had gone outside to smoke a cigarette (were not allowed to inside).  I was not the only one out there, others (strangers) were out there as well for the same reason.   We were all talking when I had a strange feeling,  I looked up and hovering directly over top of the Nathan Goff Armory (National Guard Armory), there was an enorrmous round disc shaped UFO.  It was as big as the building, and in the front of the building where I was standing, it hung out over the roof.   There was three sets of lights, one white, two blue, all of which were constantly in motion revolving around the thickest part of the UFO.  There was no sound, nor air disturbance.   We all saw it and watched it for about 2 minutes.  Nothing happed, it just hovered there.  Then you could feel an energy in the air, but nothing more, and the craft shot straight up and was gone.   Again, there was no sound or displaced wind, nothing, it was just gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));39.2874000000001;-80.3418999999996
Round, pulsating orange object in the sky -- no noise;2013-02-02 20:00:00;2 minutes;Round, pulsating orange object in the sky -- no noise Clarksburg, WV--beginning of February 2013:  It was about 8pm and I was outside sweeping snow off the back stoop.  I looked up to let the snow fall on my face and saw a round, pulsating orange object slowly moving in the sky over my house.  It was headed toward Rt. 50.   It didn’t make any noise.  It didn't dart around.  It stayed in a straight, steady line.   When my girlfriend saw it, she said it looked like the object was on fire because of the way it was glowing.   We watched it for a couple of minutes until it went out of sight.  (The hillside in front of the house, which is the side of Rt. 50, obstructed our view.)   It was so weird, yet exciting!

Numerous reddish orange spheres moving at high speed from north to south.;2014-09-13 20:30:00;30 minutes;Numerous reddish orange spheres moving at high speed from north to south. Neighbor rang our door bell around 8:30 PM on Saturday, September 13, 2014.  Upon going outside, my wife and I saw several groupings of round, reddish orange objects, in a very loose formation, traveling north to south at a high rate of speed.  What appeared to be sparks were falling from the sides and trailing edge of several of them.  I was looking at them through 16 power binoculars.  The bottom of each round object appeared to be composed of multiple circles of light such as an LED flashlight.  We heard no sound from them.  The height was above the cloud layers.  The clouds appeared to be at or above 15,000 feet.  The cloud layer they overflew was approximately 10 miles due south of our location.  They appeared to be well above that cloud level.  There were 3-4 loose formations of 8-10 objects.  Several minutes after the last formation there were two “Tail End Charlies.”   I am an ATP/CFII/MEI with over 4000 hours.;39.2874000000001;-80.3418999999996
