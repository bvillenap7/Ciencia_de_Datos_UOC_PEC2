Asatched the light travel back and forth and uyou could see no craft. When the light went off, oh my God.;1979-11-22 23:00:00;2 hrs;Asatched the light travel back and forth and uyou could see no craft. When the light went off, oh my God. I was off duty in November, 1979, deer season, working as an undercover vice officer.  I was traveling from a friends house and we spotted a small light on top of the hill above her house moving back and forth across the ridge.  We watched the light for almost two hours.  It went or traveled back and forth and up and down in a very slow fashion. An airplane started toward the craft and the unidentified object shut down the light and to our amazement the craft became very visible and moved very swiftly over our heads away from the oncoming airplane.  The craft was huge, you could observe the indentures of the giant steel structure pausing over our heads.  I would estimate that the craft was larger then thrre football fields combined or larger. The plane came closer and the craft took off in a southern direction faster than the speed of light. Their was no engine noise. You could see the craft fly out of sight for miles as a big black machine in the sky. I called the airport and advised them I f they had any reports of a UFO and they denied any planes being in the area.;39.2874000000001;-80.3418999999996
Silver glowing disk hovering in the sky above Clarksburg, WV.;2012-12-20 22:30:00;30 seconds;Silver glowing disk hovering in the sky above Clarksburg, WV. I was driving down Rt. 50 in Clarksburg in a massive snowstorm and I always look over downtown just because it is so beautiful from Rt. 50 right there and to my surprise hovering right above downtown is this glowing disk shaped object.  As I continue down the road I keep looking over and there it sits just hovering and glowing with a soft light.  I got a very good view of it and it even seemed as if the snow that was coming down heavily would disappear as soon as it hit the glowing part of the disk.  Had the roads not been covered with snow and I not been afraid if I pulled off the road that I would have never got back on I would have stopped and took pictures.   It had me totally in awe and its something I still think about regularly.  I got a really good view and I can say without a doubt in my mind that it is a UFO.   As for a background on me I am 28 yrs old and a construction inspector and on that particular date when I seen the disk I was driving home from Christmas shipping for my daughter. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));39.2874000000001;-80.3418999999996
2 cigar or disk shaped objects with 3 bar shaped lights on each of them.;2015-01-19 09:00:00;2:00;2 cigar or disk shaped objects with 3 bar shaped lights on each of them. Was walking up Washington Ave., when I saw a bright solid orange light.  I thought it was a new street light because it wasn't moving until it slowly started moving right.  My friend, his girlfriend and I stopped and began watching it as it sped up, before stopping again after moving from my 12 to 4.   That's when I noticed it wasn't 1 light but 3 long lights.  Then as it began moving again, I noticed a second one off in the distance.  These objects where probably at around 8000 ft if I was to guess.  It didn't make any soumd.   Whatever it was seemed large, and moved a lot like a similar object I seen around 2009.   I have seen something similar 3 times within 1 mile of each other.  All orange, but until I saw this one I never noticed the three bars of light and always thought they where 1 light.   In the past 10 years, the feds have been buying up a lot of land around here too.  And there is a Lockheed Martin factory close too.  I seriously think something weird is going on in north centeral WV.  There are places where you can see large air shafts coming out the ground, but there hasn't ever been word on what they are doing.   I hope you can dig more up on this because no one else seems to care.;39.2874000000001;-80.3418999999996
