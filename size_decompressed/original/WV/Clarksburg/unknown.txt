A  star that  wasnt a star;2002-07-06 23:00:00;6 minutes;A  star that  wasnt a star It was a little after 11:00 PM on saturday night. My family and I were all inside. My father was asleep, but my Aunt, brother, his friend, and myself were playing a game in the kitchen. My aunt walked outside to smoke ( there is no smoking allowed insinde the house.) A few minutes later she called for me. She said she needed a second opinion about something. I remember her pointing to the sky and asking me if i saw the star ...i looked and saw what appeared to be a star. Then she told me to look closer because she didnt think it was a star. As i looked closer I noticed it was flashing blue and red lights on both sides. After about 3 minutes the object shot up rather quickly...and stop very suddenly. It continues to do this in different directions for several minutes. By this time I had woken my father up and got my brother and his friend outside. A couple of minutes later the object flew away very quickly out of site.;39.2874000000001;-80.3418999999996
