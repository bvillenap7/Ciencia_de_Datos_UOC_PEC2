Orange lights in a triangular formation.;2014-01-01 00:10:00;50 seconds;Orange lights in a triangular formation I stepped out onto my back porch shortly after the ball dropped on New Year's, to see three brightly glowing objects traveling north-east in a perfect triangular formation. I opened the door and yelled for my father to come out.  By the time he got outside one of the orange lights was gone, but he witnessed the two that were still glowing and still traveling at the same speed.  The objects continued in a strait line directly over my home.  As they continued to travel north-east another of the lights went out, and the last light continued on the same trajectory until it was out of sight.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.  My father and I were both startled by what we saw.  I then decided to call and report what I had seen. I was very surprised to hear that there had been a flood of calls reporting nearly the exact same thing that I had seen all over the U.S. and Canada.  What I found very strange was the precision with which they traveled.  The three lights, or objects, maintained an exact distance from each other as they traveled.  They had to have been controlled. It was very strange.  There was no sound coming from them either.  I tried to get video of the objects, but was only able to record a 2 second clip of them on my cell phone. The quality is not very good, but they are visible.;38.375;-81.8313
