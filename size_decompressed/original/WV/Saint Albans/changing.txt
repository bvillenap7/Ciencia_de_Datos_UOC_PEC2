I was walking home with a friend in the town I live in.  The neighborhood we live in is well populated and along the Kanawha Valley in WV, although there is alot of country around here.  Me and my friend had been up all night and we were talking on our walk home when we noticed what appeared to be a plane.  We noticed that it had white lights.  I saw a light appear to come on on the front of it like a light you would see on any regular plane, but I found it rather odd that the light appeared to go off and dissapeear.  When the light went off I thought the plane had left somehow but then 3 lights came on and the object then appeared to be triangular, with a light on each corner, one red, one green, and one white.  The lights were blinking and then appeared to dissappear totally.  It should be noted the duration of the entire event we never heard any sound as to whether there was an engine in the craft or not. We were stumped as to what happened but knew we had witnessed something incredible.;38.375;-81.8313
