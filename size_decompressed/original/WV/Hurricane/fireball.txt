It was about the height of where an airplane would be flying. It stayed in place flashing for approximately a minute.  I believe it was a cell phone tower at first, then possibly a dying star.   The light then began falling to the ground whilst alternating between blue and red flashing colors.  It seemed to fall in a straight path directly towards ground.  Five seconds later it rose back into the sky, once again flashing red.   It stayed there for several seconds and fell again.  Once more it rose into the sky, further away this time.   It then began heading south/ south east while still flashing red.  It then disappeared.   I was in a vehicle in an open parking lot at this time.  The sky is very clear tonight, not overcast whatsoever.   I have never seen anything like this.   My fianc√© was also a witness to this as well and has the same account of all details.;38.4203;-81.9947000000001
