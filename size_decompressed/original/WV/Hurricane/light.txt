Unidentified Green Light Travels over Hurricane, WV.;2019-01-07 19:32:00;1 minute;Unidentified Green Light Travels over Hurricane, WV. Date/Time: Monday, January 7, 2019 at approximately 7:30 p.m. Location:  Teays Lane, Hurricane, WV.  I was outside walking my dog, when she became unusually spooked.  I looked due south and noticed a solid green light that, with the glow of the clouds around it, looked to be just under half the size of a full moon in the night sky.  It moved north directly overhead and glowed with a kind of high intensity neon green.  I have never seen a colored light shine through the clouds so brightly.  At the time, the national weather service reported a cloud ceiling of 2,300 feet, and there was very light rain. I have an app called Flight Radar 24.  I checked this app, and no aircrafts with a transponder were anywhere within 50 miles of my location.  Being familiar with aviation and having flown an aircraft before,  I looked for an accompanying red light or even a white strobe light and there were none. The object made no noise at all, and the night was quiet enough to have heard either a propeller or jet engine at high altitude.  The intensity of the light did not change, and comparing it with other aircraft that typically fly over, it appeared to have a ground speed of well over 1000 mph.  Overall, it took approximately 1 minute to go from the southern horizon to disappear across the northern horizon.  These times were documented by a text I sent to my wife immediately before seeing it, and a phone call to my wife when it was disappearing to the north.   I tried to take a video with my cell phone but was unable to keep up with the object to even view it in the screen.  The path it took was directly over the intersection of route 34 and Interstate 64 in Teays Valley, WV.  It traveled in a straight line, made no turns, and did not appear to change altitude. I reported this to WSAZ news who hadnâ€™t received any reports yet.;38.4203;-81.9947000000001
