Slow moving, green lights, huge object.  Sunnybrook Rd. area, but could be seen for miles.;1999-03-15 20:00:00;approx. 5 minutes;Slow moving, green lights, huge object.  Sunnybrook Rd. area, but could be seen for miles. I was not the witness, but many of my close freinds were.  It was apparently over Sunnybrook Rd. when 2 seperate cars, each with 3-4 inhabitants, spotted a huge object moving across the sky.  The kights, as far as I can remember, were said to be light green.  The object itself was barely visible, its size was only known by the portion of the sky it blocked.  One car tried to follow the object, but sunnybrook ends by the interstate and they could only go so far.  At the same time, on the same day, 2 kids were skateboarding at the bank on Main Street in Hurricane when they saw the same object.  They described what they saw, and it was in the same area.  There was no realation between the two groups of people.  I am not sure of the exact date or time, and the people who did see it were either too hysterical or too embarrassed to report anything.  The one thing that was most commonly used to dismiss this sighting was that it occurred on the night of a meteor shower, however, the object was around for too long, contained multiple lights, and was absolutely enourmous.  I am posting this only because I happened across this site during a project for Marshall University and hoped that someone else may read this who saw what they saw.
