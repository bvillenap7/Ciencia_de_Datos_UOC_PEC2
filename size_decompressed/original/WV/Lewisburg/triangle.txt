I was walking the rim of the rock quarry at approximatly 2:00a.m.  I observed a triangular shaped object moving towards my location from the northern sky.  It stopped above the rock quarry and began to hover.  It was approximately 300 feet away from me and 600 feet up in the sky.  It made absolutely no sound whatsoever.  Nothing could be heard from it.  There were different colored lights on bottom side of the object, white lights on each end or wing of the triangle and lights in towards the center of the craft.  This craft was hugh.  It was capable of moving in any direction, vertically, horizontally, and angularly.  Every movement was precise, controlled, and smooth.  It would hover between moves as if it were observing something.  Needless to say I was in shock and ended up on the ground.  I was hysterical with fear and overcome with curiosity.  I had never seen anything like this before, nor have I ever since.  I tried to remain as quiet as possible so I would not be detected by the craft, but I somehow suspected it knew I was there.  I was really scared to death, and strangely struck in amazement at the same time.  It's very difficult to put into words.  I just laid there on the ground and watched it.  Finally, from a stand still in the sky, it suddenly took off at a very high rate of speed in the same direction it came from and in about 3-4 seconds it was completely gone.  That's all I remember.  It was over with the blink of an eye.  I have not spoken but to only a few people about this incident for fear of being ridiculed.  I know what I saw and to read it on paper somehow leaves it lacking in realism.  But nothing can ever change what I experienced, what I felt, what I saw.   For me it was a life changing experience.  My fiance observed that when I speak of this, I get visably shaken and nervous, he feels there's more to this than I am aware.  I am willing to be regressed, to see if I am repressing memories of that encounter.  After all these years it is still hard to think about it, much le! ss talk about it.;37.8117;-80.4434000000001
5 yellow-orange objects triangular in shape moving independant of each other in Lewiburg, WV for over 15 minutes.;2012-07-06 22:30:00;10-15 minutes;5 yellow-orange objects triangular in shape moving independant of each other in Lewiburg, WV for over 15 minutes. Was sitting outside from late afternoon until well after dark.  Saw several satellite’s and meteors.  Turned around to the SE toward Lewisburg, WV and saw 3, then 5 yellow-orange objects  rise on the horizon an hover.   At first thought 3 planets were rising in the night sky close together until all moved independent of each other, but still gravitated toward a one in particular.  Two on left moved off and dimmed.   One then reappeared and moved at vertical angles until above center object.  Triangular  in shape with three visible points of light.  Each of same size.  One on top and top on bottom.  Called for my wife who came out and also clearly observed.  When objects dimmed it seemed at first they were lowering the level of light from each and turning off.  Then it donned on us they were actually moving off initially at very slow speed and then such speed as to disappear.  Others would hover and slowly float around in the same general spot or barely move.  ! Then speed up and turn at sharp 45* angles with no visible arc.  No sound detectable.  No pulsing.  All disappeared.  We got into our truck and started to drive to next door hayfield.  Two reappeared in same location.  One left and the other stayed visible for several more minutes.  Seemed to be the one others had gravitated towards.  Then it move slowly in a linear manner, made a 45* angle to the left and poof was gone…;37.8117;-80.4434000000001
