She went into the other window near the bathroom I was in and then seen the light zigzagging near a light pole near our place. She yelled for me to come look but I was peeing but stopped myself to go look as quick as I could. I was about 2 steps away from the window before she said it vanished. She thought it was possibly police or someone with a flashlight but we went outside immediately after her sighting and there was nobody outside. I tried to recreate it with a few different flashlights but the light wasn’t solid and you could only see the beam. I’m not skeptical but if I don’t see something firsthand then I suggest more scientific explanations first so I also suggested it being a drone but a drone wouldn’t just vanish and it’s not like she seen it in the sky.. it was approximately 200 feet off the ground. My second thought was ball lighting but ! it wasn’t lighting or even raining and she said the shape was like a oval.. she also said it was similar size to a circular sled.;37.8825;-81.2023
