Fireball Object Descending from Sky;2020-06-07 19:30:00;1 minute;Fireball Object Descending from Sky I was smoking my routine cigarette when I happened to look at the sky to see a fireball or some type of craft descending from the sky. It was obviously falling or descending at high speed because I could see a trail of what I assume was fire behind it. I seen many different colors from the flame behind it such as blue, white, and faint pink. It all happened so quickly so so couldn’t photograph it but I did document it in my journal and even drew a picture of it from memory when I came back inside. I hollered at my girlfriend to come look but unfortunately she wasn’t fast enough to catch it.;37.8825;-81.2023
