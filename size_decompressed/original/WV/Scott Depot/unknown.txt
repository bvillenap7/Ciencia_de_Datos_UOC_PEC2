Secret aircraft comunicating with unknown;2014-02-27 03:05:00;3 minutes;Secret aircraft comunicating with unknown I am a evening shift postal worker in WV, once I arrive home I like to watch the stars.   I saw an object that at first glance I thought was an ordinary aircraft.  Two lights and one in the middle flashing.  It moved slow, no rash movements.  But what triggered me to send this report is that the light sequence changed.   After a few seconds all three lights were on parallel to each other, then only one was on.   Then finally the lights reappeared and changed into a triangle pattern.   I have over 6 years experience in the US ARMY.  I didn't think too much of it until I looked carefully at it and notice the light sequence.  I think it was a human aircraft, however it seemed as if this aircraft was communicating visually with another aircraft that was not seen.   There was little to no sound.;38.4465;-81.9027
