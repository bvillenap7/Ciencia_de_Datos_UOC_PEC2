Alum Creek;1995-08-08 23:00:00;do not know;Alum Creek At about 11:00 pm on the way home I came up on a straight stretch and noticed and something that long and had alot of lights. I tried to get the person that was with me to look but they would not, they kept saying there is nothing there. Getting to the end of the straight stretch, I had noticed that the 20oz soda I had propped between my legs was gone. The straight stretch of road is about a 1/2 mile long and it felt like forever. A little while later I would have dreams of little people with big eyes coming at night. I was unable to move witch made it more scary to me. I remembered someone with a red light overtop of me, and some how I was able to move my hand. When I did the light burned my finger.Still have the place on my finger;38.2874;-81.807
