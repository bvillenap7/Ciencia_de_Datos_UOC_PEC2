white square object moving very fast;2006-03-25 13:00:00;5minutes;white square object moving very fast This thing was unlike anything I have ever seen. Instead of the disk shape and metalic color I'm used to seeing this thing was square and white. I tried to watch it for changes but my husband couldn't get off of the road fast enough and it shot through the sky so fast it was gone by the time we got pulled over to the shoulder. When I first caught a glimps of it I thought it to be a bird but then I realized it was a totally square object and I thought Oh my gosh! this isn't a bird, and what bird can fly as fast as a jet which happened to be about the same height as it was. It was traveling across the area of the jet and went through the jet stream just after the jet passed. But then it shot away so fast it was gone.;38.3026;-80.8394
Reddish-orange object floating above 4th of July crowd.;2016-07-04 21:00:00;30 seconds;Reddish-orange object floating above 4th of July crowd. My wife and I were at Wal-Mart, on 4th of July.  Just before the fireworks we saw an object float in from the south.  It emitted an orange-red color.  There were many witnesses.  The object made no sound.  It seems it was observing the crowd and not interested in the fireworks because it flew west and disappeared.  The fireworks started and we did not see it after that.;38.3026;-80.8394
