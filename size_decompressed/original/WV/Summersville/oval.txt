UFO flying west, in daylight, oval shape, silver, disappeared in about 5 seconds.;2012-04-10 13:45:00;5 sec;UFO flying west, in daylight, oval shape, silver, disappeared in about 5 seconds. Tuesday, April 10, 2012 Where: Summersville, WV   I came out on my front porch at 11:45 am., during the day. The sky was clear, not a cloud in the sky. The temperature was about 65 degrees. I happened to look up and I saw a silvery object flying slowly, west.  It looked to be about the same altitude of a jetliner, about 30,000 ft.  I could not tell if it was spinning or not. It had no plume like a jetliner.  I ran into my house to grab my digital camera and when I came out, the object was gone. An airplane cannot disappear that fast. Airplanes can be followed across the sky but this object just disappeared.;38.3026;-80.8394
