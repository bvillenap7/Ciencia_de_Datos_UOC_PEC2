Large  white cylinder object heading northwest direction;2009-04-16 15:00:00;30 sec;Large  white cylinder object heading northwest direction I was in the passenger seat of the car. I was looking in the north direction for traffic and nothing was coming so I looked up at the sky as we pulled out on the road, and I saw a very large long white object  ( A large piece of pvc pipe) going northwest at a very fast speed. @1,000ft at about 60 to 70 degrees off the horizan.  I lost sight of the object as we pull on to the main road and I ask the driver the to try to pull over put we couldnt in time.;38.3026;-80.8394
Shiny, silver cylinder type UFO near Veteran's Day Parade.;2012-11-10 14:15:00;30 seconds;Shiny, silver cylinder type UFO near Veteran's Day Parade I was filming a Veteran's Day Parade and I happened to look behind me and I saw a silver  shiny cylinder type of object, floating in mid-air.  The sky was clear blue and warm that day.  The object was several hundreds of feet in altitude.  I am sure nobody else saw it because everybody's attention was on the parade. I had my camera on a tripod and I began unfastening it so I could turn around and photograph the UFO.  By the time I got my camera unfastened, which was about 20 seconds, it had vanished. I should have picked up the tripod and camera and started shooting instead of trying to unfasten the camera first. I started to bring a second camera with me that day, but didn't. Next time I will.;38.3026;-80.8394
Silver cylinder flying object with no wings, flying west, moving in a straight line, with no sound.;2014-06-23 22:30:00;5 seconds;Silver cylinder flying object with no wings, flying west, moving in a straight line, with no sound. Saw a silver cylinder flying object with no wings, flying west over town of Summersville, WV.  No sound and traveling faster than an airliner.  Did not glow.  Must have been about 10-20 thousand feet.   It flew in a straight line with no exhaust.  But I saw it fly into a light cloud and I could see exhaust but when it exited it into the blue sky, there was no exhaust.  Thought it was a gov. drone but did not see any wings. I saw the same silver flying type craft over Summersville Lake a few years ago but at a lot lower altitude. It also had no sound or wings. Don't know what this thing is but I would like to know. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I just submitted a report but, because of the use of military time, I reported the time incorrectly.  I reported it as 8pm local but it was 10pm-11pm local (I guess 22:00-23:00).  Please correct. ((END ADDENDUM));38.3026;-80.8394
