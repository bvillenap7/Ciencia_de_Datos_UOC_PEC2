Large number of planes and very bright light moving.;2019-08-29 23:00:00;1 hour;Large number of planes and very bright light moving. Looked out the front door at around 11pm and saw a very bright light in the sky that at first i thought was a star.  It was changing colors and when I saw a plane fly by it I noticed it started to move and then stopped again.  After watching for several minutes I noticed several blinking lights in the sky above a mountain in the distance that appeared to blink at random intervals, almost like they were communicating.  They would blink blue and red. I noticed a large amount of planes in the sky, at one point I counted four planes in the sky at one time. I went back inside for around fifteen minutes and came back but the bright light was nowhere to be found.  The blinking lights and planes are still in the sky at this time.;38.3026;-80.8394
