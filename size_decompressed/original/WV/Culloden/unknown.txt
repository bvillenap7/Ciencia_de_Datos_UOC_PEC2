As we were returning home, we were passing through this small town when I looked at the driver and he was staring straight ahead.  When I asked him if he was okay, he just looked at me with a terrifying gaze and said...do you see those lights?  I was in the front passenger seat and hadn't noticed them because of the color of the lights in his vehicle reflecting off the inside of the glass anyway.  To our left (south) through the trees we could see a grouping of lights (about 20) moving along with us at the same speed we were traveling, about 30 feet off the ground.  There is a mountain ridge also to our south, and the lights were below the ridgeline, between us and the ridge, and appeared to be about 300-500 yards away.  The lights were all blue and randomly scattered about the object.  The color could best be described as a cold electric blue.  They didn't flash or rotate.  We stopped the vehicle about a mile down the road and the object also stopped.  It span of the lights were about 100 feet and were about 20-30 feet high.  We could see the lights very well through the trees.  It just stayed there as we got out (and got a soda).  There was no sound.  When we left a couple of minutes later...it continued to follow us until we went through a cut in the hill.  When we came out the other side (the valley opens wider), the object burst out from behind the hill into the open and immediately flew over the south ridge.  We never saw it again.  We knew what we had seen and it still gives me chillbumps to think about it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));38.4231;-82.0702
