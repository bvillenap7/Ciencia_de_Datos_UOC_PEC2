My friend and I were walking down a street in our home town, then suddenly we heard a loud noise from the sky.  We both looked up and seen a oval shaped aircraft with a blinding light.  It was very high up in the sky then it flew down towards the woods.  After we couldnt see it any more we noticed a aura around it.

Orange glowing object flies through Ohio Valley near Huntington, WV;2019-08-03 21:23:00;90 seconds;Orange glowing object flies through Ohio Valley near Huntington, WV The object appeared Saturday night, August 3, 2019, at approximately 9:23PM (ET).  I was sitting with my wife on my patio facing NW, close proximity to the Ohio River, when I saw a large bright circle heading south.  My location is in a rural area surrounded by rolling hills and forest.  I immediately pulled out my smart phone and started recording.  I have the entire event on video with audio.  Within only a few seconds the object was almost directly overhead, moving fast and it appeared to be glowing orange.  The speed of the object appeared to be similar to a jetliner.  Over the next 30-40 seconds, the object continued south and flickered briefly, then disappeared entirely.   In this area, we see a lot of falling stars, satellites, and aircraft.  This was unlike anything we've ever seen.  More unusual was the object appeared to be guided rather than falling.;38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
