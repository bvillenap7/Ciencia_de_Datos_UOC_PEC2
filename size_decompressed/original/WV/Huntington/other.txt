Making it appear daylight outside as well.  The color everywhere was she same.  No fading or brighter in one area than the next.  Very weird. I saw it through the blinds at first, then I raised the blinds and the unusual light show continued.  ANYONE driving or outside had to experience this as well as it was so grande in nature.  What struck me odd was the fact of the clarity of blue everywhere, or orange or red when colors changed.  There were periods of no color at all then colors.  No sound heard.;38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
Two military grade Chinooks flying overhead.;2015-02-10 14:18:00;20 seconds;Two military grade Chinooks flying overhead. This is technically not a UFO because I know what it was. It was just very unusual to see.  Two Chinook twin roater helicopters were flying overhead.  There are usually helicopters but never these ones.   Just kind of wondering what they were doing. Not sure if this is the correct site to use or not. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
