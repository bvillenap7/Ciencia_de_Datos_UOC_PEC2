UFO Sighted over Spring Valley in Huntington, WV, on Christmas night.;2014-12-25 23:45:00;5 minutes;UFO Sighted over Spring Valley in Huntington, WV, on Christmas night. At approximately 8:45 pm DST, we were sitting in our living room which has a large picture window when suddenly in the southern sky, a large delta winged craft (much like the ones from the Phoenix, AZ sighting) appeared out of nowhere.   The craft hovered for about 2 minutes and began moving due north at a slow speed.  The craft had five very large orange lights changing to yellow and back.   We are approximately 2 miles from the Huntington Tri-State Airport located in Kenova, WV.  The craft moved slowly from south to north and paused for approximately five minutes.  The lights went off one at a time until only the center light remained.   It stayed in place for another 20 seconds and suddenly shot straight up.   I have a video to document the sighting in MP4 format, should you like to see it.  Thanks.;38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
