Near the horizon, it suddenly appeared in a rectangular shape. I noticed a bright star suddenly appear in the western sky at approximately an 11 o'clock position. It then fell toward the earth in a streak of white light. Near the horizon it suddenly appeared as a rectangle. Within this rectangle were vertical bands of light, the center appeared to be black and spherical. I dont recall all of the colors in the band except a green and a blue. I do recall that the colors seem to shimmer.  Visually it was a perfect rectangle and small. It disappeared without a trace.;38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
