Kanawha River West Virgina 1994;1994-12-25 04:30:00;6 minutes;Kanawha River West Virgina 1994 My wife, and I were traveling east on I-64 from St. Louis headed for West Virgina,and we had just entered into Huntington, or Charleston West Virgina near the Kanawha river about 4:30 am on Christmas eve,or Christmas day I am not sure about which day when. I was driving,and my wife was awake in the passanger seat when I told her to look over to the left,but before that I noticed an air craft that resembled a helichopter which dropped a container into the Kanawha river that looked like a parachute, then the container was lifted back up into the air craft.After that I started to slow downand,and also roll my window down to hear the sound of what I thought was a helichopter,but we hear no sound at all,and we were only about 100 yards away.We watched as the air craft moved very slowly behind the trees near the river as I followed it's path,and about 100 yards down the river when it stopped,and we pulled over to the side of the road to a stop. We both looked up just over the trees to a large window shaped object with a bright clear window that had a small bright round red,and green or even a small blue light I can't be sure on the blue light. What was so scary is that it made no sound at all from a very close range,and moved side to side up and down trying to avoid us. After we looked at it for a few minutes my wife said let's get the hell out of here. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Decades ago CNN broadcast alien contact — covered up;1995-06-01 19:00:00;~20 minutes;Decades ago CNN broadcast alien contact — covered up CNN broadcasted the airing of multiple UFOs in Russia and one landed near Moscow.  Wolf Blitzer was one of the reporters.  They also had a reporter broadcasting live from Russia and was in a large crowd.  The reporting indicated that the event appeared to be man’s first contact with extraterrestrials and the reporter in Russia pointed to objects in the sky. The broadcast was abruptly terminated and went to commercials.  When the news came back on they completely acted like it never happened and aired their regular commentaries, never mentioning it again.  This was witnessed by 5 people I knew from college that were in different locations.  However, I have never been able to find any reports about it nor meet anyone else that witnessed it.  In my opinion, it made me believe that the government is actually repressing information.;38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
At ~6:45 a.m. on 12-26-99, I watches a football shaped light approached from the S/West and travel N/East,it remained as constant starl;1999-12-26 06:45:00;10-15sec.;At ~6:45 a.m. on 12-26-99, I watches a football shaped light approached from the S/West and travel N/East,it remained as constant starlike light in a football shape(horizontal position),no strobes or beacon lights seen on it, appeared to  be at a low altitude or a 25 to 30 degree angle on the horizon. Saw it for 10-15 sec. and it looked the  same coming as it did going. No strobes, beacons or sound. 12-26-99 at ~6:45a.m. while walking my dog, I looked up to see a very high flying jet overhead that I had heard roaring in the distance(the jet had red,green and white strobes easily seen). After the jet flew out of sight toward the S/West and I could no longer hear it, I saw a football shaped light approach from the S/West and a much lower altittude. It was approx. 25-30 degrees above the horizon line and moved at a very quick pace. It grew in intensity as it passed over Huntington,but it never revealed a strobe or flashing beacon light. It looked like a football travelling horizontally. from my S/W(my left) to N/E(my right). I watched and followed it till it went out of my view. The sky was crystal clear,the waning moon was visible and I could even see white con tails that streaked the pre-dawn sky. Not a sound could be heard as it traveled at a very quick clip. Perhaps 5x's as fast as the passenger jet I had seen a few minutes earlier. Just a football shaped light as big as a grain of rice held at arm's length.No contrail, marker lights or sound. Looked the same coming as it did going.;38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
A distortion in the sky that moved and stopped, then moved again.;2001-11-01 21:00:00;1 minute;A distortion in the sky that moved and stopped, then moved again. My parents and I were just sitting on our porch about twenty one minutes ago when I saw what I would describe as a distortion of the sky. It kinda looked like maybe a triangle, but I couldn't really tell. It was huge, I would guess maybe a hundred feet or more, depending on how high up it was. It moved really slowly over the tree tops and slowed down as it came over the Ohio River. It looked like it was just looking at the water then it came towards our house. It speeded up and dissapeared over the hill to the back of our house. I'm not really sure of the exact details, but it seemed to have a sphere on the bottom, but like I said it was just a distortion. The reason I think it had a sphere on the bottom(semi-sphere) is the way the stars moved. They got longer and longer, and then seemed to get really close at the middle of the distortion. This is my second Ufo sighting, but I really don't know what it was. It could have been some strange gas that can stop and move again or a military aircraft that can go invisible. The reason I don't know if it is or not is because I never heard of anything like this before, but if it was a Ufo, it's a strange one. And something else that was weird, all of our watches stopped at the same time, and was a minute behind all of the ones in the house.;38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
A distortion;2001-11-01 21:00:00;about i mine;A distortion Ok, my son, my husband and I saw something, but I don't really know what it was. It looked like the stars were moving in a direction coming toward us. My son seems to believe its aliens, but I don't believe in that sort of stuff. He said he summited another sighting him and his brother had last year, and he said it would be helpful if his brother would email you. He asked me to email you to tell you my verson of it. All it really did was move across the sky and stop. Then it moved again over our house. Thats about all it did, and our watches were a minute behind the clocks in the house.;38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
