I and my girlfriend watched a silvery luminous football shaped object.;2008-02-28 16:00:00;1.5-2minutes;I and my girlfriend watched a silvery luminous football shaped object. I felt drawn outside around 4 pm on 2/27/08(Thursday).  I was looking at a few jets spewing out chemtrails when I noticed a silvery football shaped orb (w/no exhaust nor features). It was a very clear, blue bird sky with the exception of the chemtrails.  I yelled for my girlfriend to come outside and she spotted it also.  We both agreed it looked more like an oval, football shape with a silvery luminosity that stood out in contrast compared to the chemtrail jets that were close to it. At one point in the beginning, I thought the object was going to crash into or nearly miss a chem trail jet as they approached each other from opposite directions.  I caught one good photo with my digital binoculars as it faded into the distance.  I and my girlfriend have filled reports with MUFON and I have spoken with the West Virginia MUFON investigator.;38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
White pulsing disc near moon over Huntington WV;2014-05-16 07:30:00;2 minutes;white pulsing disc near moon over Huntington WV My wife and I were walking out of a business at approximately 7:30am, it was a very clear morning sun was out as was the moon (it was full), I noticed a white disc object that had a pulsing haze around it.  I pointed it out to my wife, the object was in the southern sky what looked right next to the moon, the object moved west toward the moon then dipped as if it was tracing the moon, making a “U” maneuver.  The object moved westward further then dipped straight down southward and stopped. When the object stopped it hovered in place for a few seconds and small flash of light emitted and the object then disappeared.  In my general vicinity 3 people (myself, my wife, and one other person) was watching the object.;38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
