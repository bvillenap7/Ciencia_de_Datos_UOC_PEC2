We were on I-64 near intersection of WV, OH, and KY, near Huntington, WV.  The object was glowing, no visible means of propulsion.  No markings.  Two aircraft approached, one from east, other from northwest.  Son had binoculars, identified one as Navy Tomcat, other as Air Force F something or other.  He  had binoculars.  As aircraft approached, the cigarette shaped object glowed very brightly, like a magnesium flare, then became invisible.  The aircraft broke off and returned to their bases, apparently. Dear friend, now deceased, had farm near Beattyville, KY.  There is a Buddhist monastery near there, and they were apparently contacting aliens as at Mt. Shasta.  Many people congregated there to observe, her dad gave them permission to camp out.  The sightings were reported to newspaper in Lexington, KY.  Dr. Kern, an astronomer at U of KY, said the UFOs were the planet Venus.  No wonder people hesitate to report.

cylinder shaped craft enters cloud bank and never reappears;2004-07-12 17:40:00;1 minute;cylinder shaped craft enters cloud bank and never reappears I was standing at the kitchen sink and looked out of the window. Traveling in a north-south course was a dull silver cylinder shaped object. It was traveling at a leisurely, steady pace and I first thought it was an airplane.  However, I suddenly realized that the object had no wings or tail. I retrieved my binoculars from the nearby utility room and walked to another window in the kitchen which faces south. I expected to get a better view of the object from this vantage point. Just as I reached the window, the object entered a small cumulus cloud bank. Although I didn't have time to look at it with the binoculars, still was unable to see any wings or a tail that would indicate a plane. The object never reappeared from the cloud.  There were no other clouds in the vicinity of this one. I searched the skies for approximately 10 minutes both visually and with binoculars to no avail. It definitely wasn't a blimp or an ultra-light. Even if it had been one or the other , it should have reappeared from the clouds. There was no haze in the skies. Weather conditions at the time of the sighting: Sunny, partly cloudy. Temperatures 86 with the winds from SW 10 mph. Visibility at 10 miles.;38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
cylinder shaped object with no lights or sound with plane following behind it;2008-10-01 05:00:00;10 minuts;cylinder shaped object with no lights or sound with plane following behind it Four of were sitting outside in the warm weather then all of a sudden we saw this silver cylinder shape thing in the sky. It had two silver cyclinder shape object side by side with what looked like some kind of bar in the middle connecting them together.  It was heading toward the Ohio River. There was no sound. It had no wings. There was a small plane following behind it. We watched it until it went out of our sight. There were no lights on the cylinder shape thing and it and the plane were not going very fast and they were low in the sky. We can't be sure of what it was but it was something we had never seen before. The weather was really nice outside and people were in the pool swimming. I wouldn't mind talking to someone but since I have only a cell phone I can't except collect calls on it so if someone would like to talk to me I'll be glad to talk with them.;38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
