cigar-shaped ufo spotted .;2003-02-15 14:00:00;4 minutes;cigar-shaped ufo spotted . First of all, I belong to the LORD and it is HE who guides me to write this. My daughter and I were traveling from Huntington, on I64 headed east to our house in Putnam,co. we looked up in the sky and we saw an aluminum-sublike ufo(what you call,cigar-shaped-maybe). It was moving slowly(extremely)and being in the passing lane,I crossed over to pull off on the burm to watch it. It was just there moving ever so slightly and it just dissapeared. It was very large,silver and although The  LORD has blessed me to see many UFO's I've never seen any that looked like this. Several days later, my daughter and I were at a food drive-thru in putnam,co and we were waiting for our order when she said,mom is that a star? I said,no, that's a ufo.It wasn't until many days later when I was telling a friend about the experience we realized the ufo we were looking at during the drive-thru, were two different ufo's because the one I saw was red and the one she saw was white(these looked like little circles and did not last long-maybe a minute). I was trying to find the CIA-UFO information to give a report of something from the past that is present now that has to do with our visitors. I can no longer find a web site for their UFO information  listed. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
cigar shape objects came from the South heading toward the Ohio River to the North;2008-06-30 17:00:00;5 mins;Cigar shape objects came from the South heading toward the Ohio River to the North Last summer (2008) 4 of us adults were sitting in the front yard when we spotted an unusual object in the sky.  It was around 5 p.m.  We saw two cigar shape objects silver in color side by side and appeared to have something in the middle connecting them together.  A few hundred feet behind this object was a small plane following it.  They didn't seem to be traveling very fast. They came from the  South and was heading toward the North toward the Ohio River.  We live on Rt. 2 or what use to be called Ohio River Rd. I called the news station and all they said was that I have seen something very unusual but weren't really interested.  I also called the UFO reporting hotline and I got a recording that they would have to call me back collect.  I have a cell phone and can't take collect calls even if I wanted to. Iâ€™m 54 years old and swear to you this is true. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
