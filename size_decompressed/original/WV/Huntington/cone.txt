Security guard and I watched an ice cream cone like object.;2007-02-23 20:40:00;two to three min.;Security guard and I watched an ice cream cone like object. I have a witness this time.  Tonight at work at approximately 8:40pm, I saw the same  cone like object from Altizer, as it hovered over the Procterville area.  As soon as I came outside, I immediately located the luminous object but it was a bit higher in the sky and somewhat closer (approx. 20 degrees) above the horizon. I motioned the security guard to come over.  I pointed it out to him and told him it was the same object I had seen the previous evening at approx. the same time.  We were looking towards the north.  We stood together and watched the object as it hovered and slowly moved eastward (almost drifting like a balloon) around the hillside and dipped out of view.  It was in view for approx two to three minutes.   We both agreed it wasnâ€™t a star or a plane (the sky was very clear w /a few planes high up).  We both watched it together for approx. two to three minutes before it drifted east and dipped downwards.  The guard said it seem to be over RT. 775 in Ohio.;38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
