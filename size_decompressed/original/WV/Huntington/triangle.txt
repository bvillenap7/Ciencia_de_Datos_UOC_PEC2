30 foot triangle shaped, constant humming, static electric which made face and arms tingle, disapeared toward the west.;2001-04-22 20:50:00;2 minutes;30 foot triangle shaped, constant humming, static electric which made face and arms tingle, disapeared toward the west. Responded to a barking dog & noise disturbance.  Upon arrival a constant humming noise could be heard, almost felt coming from the vincinity of the river(Ohio River).  While walking toward the sound, a dark triangle shaped object, about 30 feet across, slowing emerged from behind a clump of trees.  A static electric feeling was in the air, causing my skin to tingle, espically my face and arms, which were exposed.  The triangle shaped object continued to raise to about a 100 feet in the air, then took off toward the west, slowly at first, then so quick, it was gone.  This was about 1 mile from the tristate airport, which reported nothing unusual.;38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
Triangular white LED lights in the pitch black night sky.;2015-12-07 01:00:00;30 seconds;Triangular white LED lights in the pitch black night sky. I was outside childishly throwing  pebbles at a huge possum that was sitting on a branch way up in the tree when in my perephreal vision I saw what appeared to be a flock of white birds in the pitch black night sky.  As they flew closer I noticed it wasn't birds at all but white led lights in a perfect v formation.  It flew low and quickly and just as fast as it appeared it disappeared.  I understand there is another explanation.  It may have been a government drone.  However if it wasn't the only other explanation is just out of this world.;38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
