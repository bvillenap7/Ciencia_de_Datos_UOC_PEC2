As it came ;1999-12-29 19:20:00;10-15 sec.;Watched a bright luminous light approach low over city From the S/W. Made no sound as it moved at a slow steady rate speed. As it came closer towards being directly over head it looked more like a star  radiating light striations. Then it suddenly blinked out. While taking an evening walk with my dog, I noticed a large rounded light appraoch low in the sky. I first thought that it was the medivac heliocopter that can be seen on a daily basis but as it got closer no discernible noise could be heard. I walked up the street where the trees would not block my view and I stood still - waiting for it to pass directly over me. I noted, that compared to western horizon and the hills and low mountains in the east that it may have been at 1500 feet or less and was no more than a mile away. The degree of angle may have been 30 to 35. Sky was clear and the moon was brightly waning. It became larger as it appraoched ( size of a penny held at arm's length). By now it looked more like a slow moving, pinkish star low in the sky-complete with raditing striations. Then before it got over head , it just simply blinked out. Never made a sound. Other identifiable craft could be seen flying at much higher, safer altittudes (silouetted against the sky w/red,green & white strobes on them). But none of them were like this fallen starlike object. in addition I could see a thick dark contrail where the object had been before it winked out.;38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637

Numerous star-like objects observed in Huntington, WV;2013-08-02 21:30:00;1:30;Numerous star-like objects observed in Huntington, WV The following events occurred from approximately 21:00 on August 2, 2013 until about 23:00 and were observed by myself, my step-son, and my son while we were eating dinner on our front porch:  	Just as dusk was setting in, a low flying black military helicopter fly over our home from west to northeast.  I was facing the east on the porch which faces south.  Then as darkness filled the sky, while we were talking, I had noticed a bright star-like object in the eastern sky.  I turned my head and said something then looked back up and the large object became a swarm of blinking smaller white objects.  My response caused both witnesses to look to the east and what we saw was at least 8-10 blinking objects that dispersed moving rapidly in all directions and then just disappeared.  It reminded me of a swarm of lighting bugs.  Only one stayed blinking heading in a southwest direction before also disappearing.  A short while later, another bright white object which had been in a south east position during the first event started to get brighter as it moved in northwest direction and then just disappeared.  We saw several smaller objects that were star- like going in different di! rections after that.  One even made a sharp left while moving north. Some were smaller than others.  Around 23:00, two more helicopters fly over the house going south west. One was flying just above the tree tops and had a spot light of some sort turned on. We did observe many planes during the event and checked to see if any satellites were passing over during the discussed time frame and found that there were in fact two.  We live close to two hospitals which do use life flights and a small airport.  In addition, we had some cloud cover overhead last night along with some clear skies. All the observers are over the age of twenty-one, no one was drunk, medicated, or high.  The young men are both educated and I have a M.A. in political science.  I do not have a logical explanation for what I witnessed on that evening.;38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
Green lights in the sky.;2018-10-01 11:31:00;2 seconds;Green lights in the sky Me and my girlfriend were driving down 3rd avenue, heading home from work and all of sudden we see a small light in the sky and suddenly we realize it happens to be flying across the sky really low, flashing multiple colors but mostly green, we only got to see it for 2 seconds so this all happens really fast but other people on Facebook seen it as well;38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
