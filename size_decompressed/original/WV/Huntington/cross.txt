Most where red but a few where whitrAs I watched more abd more came out from behind the trees.  They moved in a kjnd of staggered line.  The ones that where white had little balls of white light thtat fell from them.  They all moved west at the same speed until they reached a point in the sky where it looked like they moved away from earth and slowly faded away.;38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
