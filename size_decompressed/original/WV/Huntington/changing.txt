Well, at about 2:30 in the morning, I walked out on my porch. I heard a siren type noise, and it seemed to be coming from every direction. I walked off my porch and saw what I thought were five search planes because they had a bright light in the center of them which slowly blinked. They were, I'm guessing, about two hundred feet up. They all came really close together, and then the siren noise stopped. They flew over the ohio river, and just stopped there. Then, there was a weird swishing noise, like you would expect to hear at the beach. One of the lights faded out, and the rest of the lights grew brighter, and it happened again and again until there was only one, extremely bright light. The light started to dim, and then it changed from a weird ball shape to a more of a ring shape. The ring was about 15 feet in diameter, not very big at all. The ring started to spin, and then stopped. The light fell into the water, and then came back up again, kind of like when you are flying a kite and it goes down and up. From what I saw, It looked like it was making the water come out of the river and flow straight up like a rod. The water stopped when it was around ten feet off the river. Then, the water dropped back into the river and the ring formed a ball again. The ball just kinda fell into the river and the light went out. I'm not sure what it was, but I am pretty darn sure it wasn't a plane.;38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
2 round objects in the sky.;2020-11-08 14:00:00;2 minutes;2 round objects in the sky. On Thursday 11/8/2020 at approximately 2 pm I was in the parking lot of a Speedway gas station in Huntington West Virginia, delivering fuel to the location.  I was looking up to see if I could see any airplanes and noticed two white things that appeared to float in the air.  At first I thought they were pieces of paper or something floating the way paper ash floats in the air from a fire. But, there was no fire.  These two objects were shiny.  I was wearing dark polarized sun glasses and could not see these objects at all when I took my sun glasses off.  They seemed to spin or rotate because they went from being round looking to a straight line perpendicular to the ground and then back round again.  I could not tell how big they were because there was nothing to reference them to.  At first they seemed to float, then one of them shot straight south really fast. The other one stopped and stayed motionless. The one that had zipped away stopped and zipped right back over to the one that stopped.  A normal airplane went by behind them and it was really slow compared to how fast they scooted across the sky.  I did not hear any noise or sound from the objects.  I watched them for another 30 seconds or so and they just went away. The whole thing lasted maybe a minute and a half to two minutes.  I have no idea what these things were but they were not anything I've ever seen or what I'd consider “normal” to see in the sky.;38.4149722222223;-82.4277134920637
