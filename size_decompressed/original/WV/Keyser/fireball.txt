West Virginia man sees strange orange object in the night sky;2014-11-03 01:30:00;5 minutes;West Virginia man sees strange orange object in the night sky As I walked outside my home, I looked in the sky to see a round shaped orange glowing object shooting across the sky at the speed of a shooting star.  The object was moving in a north west direction than quickly made a 45Pop degree turn at a rapid speed changing its direction to south west.  It was moving to fast to be any kind of man made plane or helicopter.  The object couldn't have been a shooting star or space junk falling to earth because of its rapid change in direction.   I will be the first to tell you that I don't believe in such things as aliens and ufo's.  However, their can be no other explaination for what I saw in the sky.
