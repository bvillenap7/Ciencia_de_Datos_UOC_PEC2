It was solid red and then solid white, changing between those colors every minute or so.  It stopped in the sky, stayed there for a few minutes and then disappeared.  I observed the object from a dark back road.  I wasn't in any kind of vehicle and there wasn't any houses or buildings in the immediate area.  I tried to get a picture and/or video of it with my phone but I couldn't see it on my screen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
