The distance it covered in the few seconds I viewed it was about 5 miles. There was no sound at all.  It passed almost directly over the City of Keyser and disappeared from view as it went beyond Green Mountain.  The light was blue/white and it shimmered beautifully as it passed.  The light around it also seemed to be somewhat distorted.;39.4527;-78.8926
