Red, yellow/white, and blue lights on saucer object floating over house. UFO WV.;2013-01-19 17:00:00;1 minute;Red, yellow/white, and blue lights on saucer object floating over house. UFO WV. As I was driving home,I saw an orange light off in the distance and thought it to be rather strange.  As I approached it closer and closer it came up on my left on route 19 on the way home to Fairmont, WV.   I completely stopped my car in a 55 mph zone and rolled down my window.  It was cold out but clear and I saw a disk object about the size of my car spinning and hovering over this house flashing red, yellowish/white and blue lights.  It hovered for around 15-20 seconds and then took off a little slowly, it sat for another couple seconds and took off into the sky.   That is when I quickly grabbed my Iphone 5 and snapped three pictures.  It was around 6pm so it was slightly dark but the quality is rather good and you can see the lights spinning on the object.   I also had my window rolled down and noticed the object to be very quiet.  Like a fan you'd have in your bedroom in the summer.;39.494;-80.2221
