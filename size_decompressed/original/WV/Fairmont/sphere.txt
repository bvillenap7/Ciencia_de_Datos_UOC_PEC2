We were driving South on US Rt 250 in the Watson area of Fairmont West Virginia at approximately 8:25 PM.  At that time we both noticed a small light moving directly above the highway which appeared to be moving from South to North directly above the highway.   At that time we stopped at the top of the hill at the intersection of Otlahurst Drive and US Rt 250.  I get out of the car and I see the object moving very slowly in what appeared to be a North to South direction.  It appeared to be moving directly above the Tygart River from this vantage point.  I got my ipone out and shot video of the object for approximately 1-2 minutes.   To the point I got tired of shooting, and then right after I stopped, the object disappeared into the sky or clouds.  It was very cloudy on this evening and it is possible that our view was blocked by the clouds.  It did appear to be very low in the sky.   Possibly 300 feet or less above the ground.  At first we thought it could ha! ve been a helicopter.  But there was absolutely no noise.  Then we thought it could have been a balloon that somebody illuminated somehow.;39.494;-80.2221
