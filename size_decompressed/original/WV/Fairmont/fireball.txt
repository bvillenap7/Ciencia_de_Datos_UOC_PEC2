On the night of June 11, 2011, in a middle-upper class neighborhood in Fairmont, WV, my mother and I were chatting outside, when she interrupted me by jumping out of her chair running across the deck pointing.  What the heck is that, she excitedly yelped?  High on the horizon in the far off distance we observed many fireballs moving relatively slowly, with no sound in uninformed groups of 3-5 totaling about 15. I ran in the house to grab my camera & attempted to capture a picture of them.  After approximately 4 minutes they disappeared.  Not knowing how to change the shutter speed this is was my best shot.;39.494;-80.2221
Red, orange fiery, glowing sphere witnessed by five people.;2013-06-22 22:00:00;3-5 minutes;Red, orange fiery, glowing sphere witnessed by five people. My family and I were sitting around on our porch one clear, summer night when my father noticed the object first.  It was a round fiery glowing sphere with red, orange light that seemed to undulate as a fire would but within this circular object.  We noticed it slowly moving seemingly toward us in an angled, upward  direction.  There wasn't any audible sound at all.  We all went out on our lawn, and,  as we watched it was right over us at this point.  Not sure how high it was, but the size was approximately the same as my thumb nail at arms length.  At this point it continued to slowly ascend upwards no longer at an angle.  We watched it became smaller and smaller until it was no longer in sight.;39.494;-80.2221
