star like light  that changes colors;2008-09-01 23:00:00;35 mins;star like light  that changes colors It was around 11:00 pm on Sept. 1, 2008, when what seemed to be a large bright star, shone in the sky.  I was inside sitting on the sofa talking to a family member.  My attention was drawn to the window and the star.  I asked my cousin to look at the star because it seemed to be changing colors.  We both agreed that it was changing color from white to red and then to blue.  We then grabbed two other family members and a couple pairs of binoculars and went out onto the front porch.  Through the binoculars we could see the light changing colors in an almost fibre optic style.  The light hovered slightly above the tree line for about 35 minutes. At times it seemed to fade and then become stronger.  After about 35 minutes it began to dip down into the tree line.  After that, it just disappeared. Very unusual.
