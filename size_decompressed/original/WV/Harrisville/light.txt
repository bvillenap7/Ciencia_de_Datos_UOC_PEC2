Lime green bar of light in evening sky.;2008-04-08 20:30:00;2 minutes;Lime green bar of light in evening sky. Went to take trash out and as I was walking around the patio behind our house I glanced up in the sky.  Looking over the roof of our house I saw a lime green bar of light stationary in the evening sky.  It was about five feet long and hung silently.   I stopped and starred at the light for about half a minute and then became paranoid.   Got a feeling I was being watched by someone or something.  I darted behind the house so I would be out of view.  Thoughts of what should I do came to mind.  So I walked down to the corner of the house and peeked around to see if the light was still there.  It still hung there in the sky in the same place.   Dropped the bag of trash off at the can and ran back around the backside of house.  When I got back to the side door, I asked my wife to come outside and take a look.  I went around to the front of the house and light was going.;39.1436;-81.0323
