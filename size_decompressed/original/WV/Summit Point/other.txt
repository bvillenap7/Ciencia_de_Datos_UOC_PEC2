Early in the morning. Before Dawn, approximately 0545, I saw a glowing orb in the sky, southeast over my house. The object was a glowing orb. It hung motionless in the sky. Stationary, if you will. Object glowed red on the end. Object was conical in shape, similar to a shuttlecock from badmitton. The tip was red, the middle was glowing green and the opposite end was a pale glowing yellow. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We do not know what direction the witness was looking, but we wonder whether he might have been looking at a long-lasting contrail, which was reflecting sunlight from the rising Sun.
