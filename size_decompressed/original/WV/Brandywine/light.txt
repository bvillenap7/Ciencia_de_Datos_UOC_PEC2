At first I figured the light to be that of a planes landing light which then dimmed which I told myself was a result of it changing altitude.  The brightness fluctuated which seemed awkward for a air craft to change altitude so much. When first spotted it was near Cassiopeia heading towards the constellation Taurus.  When it was over head I spotted no additional or flashing lights and after it was heading away it remained just as bright which alerted to me this was not the landing gear of an air craft.  Just after passing Taurus now heading towards Orion the light was extinguished. I do not wish to disclose my background, but I am law enforcement related.  I was just outside smoking a cigarette getting ready to head for work.;38.6357;-79.2096
