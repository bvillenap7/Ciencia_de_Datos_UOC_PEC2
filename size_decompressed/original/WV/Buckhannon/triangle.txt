Me and a friend began to examine the craft and noticed a strange light configuration.  Three small lights in each corner (red) and a pulsating lght in the center (orange).  Until that day we were both sceptics. The ship was making making no sound at all and was sitting absolutely still.  We exited the car and began to get a better look.  It was very large in a perfect triangular shape.  The lights at each corner were very small in comparison to the large center light and were also not pulsating.  They were red in color but appeared to fade slightly into an orange in the center.  In the middle of the craft was at first glance an orange light but after careful examination was hanging down like a large ball of light pulsating and fading and then restoring to full brightness.  We then realized that the road permitted a closer look.  We entered the car and began towards it.  We ran under a passing of trees and then cleared them.  the veiw of the ship was elliminated by the trees.  Upon reaching the other side the ship was gone from sight.  The sides appeared to slope inward at an angle from bottom to top.;38.9755;-80.2407
