What I saw happpened about two years ago. I am a truckdriver and I was relaxing with my head out the window of my truck and I saw a white object streaking toward, how can I discribe this, let me see, an object in the sky that looked like hole with a white halo around it. The best that I can make of it was that the lights was on the top of it and the light rays were reflecting off the top of the object back into space creating a halo so to speak. Anyway, I counted a total of 17 of these objects fly into it (the halo) and dissapear. I took it they landed on the top. That is what I observed. I know that their is not a ship of ours up there or an orbiting platform of any kind that we have to my knowlege.;38.9755;-80.2407

Bright light lit up the entire sky. Circle shape shot through the sky. Leaving behind a glowing neon (purple/blue) streak that remained for at least a minute. Streak was horizontal to the ground. After the light faded, everything was dark. No other sounds or lights afterward. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));38.9755;-80.2407

Then the lights went out, we heard a loud roaring sound like a jet and saw lighting flashing sideways.  It sounded like it went straight over us, then nothing.;38.9755;-80.2407
