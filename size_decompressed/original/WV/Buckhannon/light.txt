At first my neighbor and I thought they were just people in the woods with flashlights.  But after he walked through the woods between our houses, and told me to come watch.  We observed more than 6-10 individual lights, that floated through the woods all around the mountain that my house sits on.  When we shined a strobing light towards them, they moved closer but got dimmer. Some lights were orange, some white, some yellow, and they often changed colors and brightness.  We also used night vision to observe, which revealed beams that looked almost like search lights, scanning the fields below us.  Even with the naked eye you could see the lights scanning through the trees.  They moved smoothly and quickly, like drones almost but they aren't drones.  The sounds accompanying the lights were mostly a constant hum like a car engine running and occasionally revving, and both of us because separately heard what! sounded like water running toward us.  However we are on top of a mountain with nothing but cow pasture and Forest around us, with no streams or creeks or ponds.  Honestly very freaked out.  I thought maybe the neighbor was losing his mind but tonight it was too real.  As for our backgrounds, I'm a college educated single mother, and he is an ex military truck driver.;38.9755;-80.2407
