UFOs Observed Over Buckhannon, WV - September 2012;2012-09-26 19:00:00;~10-15 minutes;UFOs Observed Over Buckhannon, WV - September 2012 UFO cluster/formation of approx. 15-20 smaller-sized oval shaped black objects suspended and floating lower in the sky area (below clouds, but high above buildings).  Approx. 5 of the objects were separated from the rest of the cluster/formation, with each of these spaced in what appeared to be near-equal lengths apart, but in a zig-zag patterning.  The cluster/formation of at least a dozen of these objects appeared to move &quotlightly&quot and without any particular observable &quotcontrolled&quot movements.  They would occasionally separate in small distances from one another, but only for brief periods before returning to very close proximity to one another.  All of the objects appeared to be the same size and shape, and all appeared to &quotfloat&quot in the same general direction.   One of us described the objects we were observing as appearing &quotlight as feathers&quot.   A video was captured using a Nokia Lumia 900 cellular phone camera, howe! ver upon playback the objects are nearly indistinguishable from the sky, with the exception of the cluster/formation of objects - which still appear quite small to the eye on video.  These objects were first spotted as we were traveling on Camden Ave., toward the intersection of Camden Ave. and Marion St.  After stopping at the stop sign at this intersection, we made a left turn toward the &quotPoe&quot Bridge on Marion St. and stopped the vehicle before the bridge in a parking lot, near where a new church is being built.  We got out of the car and observed the craft for about 10 minutes, as they gradually moved toward US-33.  Observers of these objects are two males, both withholding graduate degrees in the field of psychology. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
