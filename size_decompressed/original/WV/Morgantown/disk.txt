It was getting dark, so I decided that i had better turn around and head home. Just as I turned around for home, a huge light appeared coming out of the sky. It became closer and closer. It then came about  feet off the ground, 20 yeards away from me. Then it left. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is anonymous to us.  PD));39.6246234177214;-79.9446702531646
Saucer-like object seen passing by downtown Morgantown;2009-03-23 09:50:00;30 seconds;Saucer-like object seen passing by downtown Morgantown I was in a classroom and happened to look out the window just at the moment a spacecraft-looking object passed by.  It was moving at what I would call a normal velocity for an airplane (i.e. did not zip by). It was moving in such a way that it passed by all the windows in the classroom, so I had about 30 seconds to look closely at the object. At first I thought it was an airplane, but did not see any wings or tail the object looked just like a saucer or the generic idea of what a UFO might look like. I honestly couldn't believe my eyes and kept watching as it passed by, looking intently because I expected to recognize it as an airplane.   I'm terrible at gauging distances, but the object seemed close enough to where I would have expected to hear some noise from the jets, were it an airplane.  I did not hear anything. The lack of tail was especially puzzling and I'm still convinced the object was not an airplane.;39.6246234177214;-79.9446702531646
