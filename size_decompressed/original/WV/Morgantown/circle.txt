Solid round silver ball passing over at about 3000MSL.;2004-10-10 14:00:00;10 sec;Solid round silver ball passing over at about 3000MSL. I was rideing with my girlfriend on I-68 West 1/2 mile leaving the sabertan exit on a clear day and happened to look out of the passenger window and up. I saw a solid silver ball shaped object cross over to the right of the car at an altitude of about 3000 MSL. I am a private pilot and the object didnt look annything like an aircraft. It was moving  to fast for an aircraft. It only took ten seconds from our car to the horizan to disappear.  I called the Morgantown airport minutes after the incident on the cell phone to see if they got it on radar and the reported no.  No wings,no tail, round and ball shaped. I never believed any of the storys until I seen for myself. I will never forget.  I wasnt sure who to report this to until I watched the ABC show on UFOs.  Thank you.

Large white ball of light with incredible speed and directional changes.;2018-09-27 05:00:00;5-7 seconds;Large white ball of light with incredible speed and directional changes. I am a smoker, but do not smoke in my home because we have children.   I went out around 5am, before getting ready for work, and saw large white ball of light flying at an amazing rate and speed in the sky.  Much larger than a star, which makes me think it is closer to us.  The turn radius and speed  were insane, and it flew off so quickly after changing direction in mid air.  I have never seen anything move so quickly and change direction so effortlessly.  Very intriguing.  This is the third occurrence, since I have lived at this location.;39.6246234177214;-79.9446702531646
