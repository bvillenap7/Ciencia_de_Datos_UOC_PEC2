Cigar shape rolling through sky;2010-08-16 19:45:00;5 minutes;Cigar shape rolling through sky My boyfriend called me on the phone and told me to get the camera and run down to the parking lot because he spotted a UFO.  He had just arrived home and noticed a metallic cigar shape flying above the treeline.  The camera battery was dead but I got our dog and ran down anyway. By the time I got to the parking lot, the object had flown out of sight behind some hills.  We got in the car to drive a bit in the general direction it went and see if we could spot it again, but we couldn't see due to all the hills in the area.   About five minutes later, we headed to our apartment building.  We went to let the dog use the bathroom and that was when I spotted the object, headed back in the same direction it came from.  It looked like a jet with no wings, and it made no sound. I could not see any markings.  It appeared to be rolling like a barrel as it made its way through the sky.  My boyfriend estimated it to be at 1,000 ft. altitude.  He also saw an antenna on the craft which I did not notice.   We watched it for about a minute until it flew out of sight.  About two years ago we saw an object that was the same shape and also appeared to roll or rotate as it flew before in this town, also in broad daylight.
