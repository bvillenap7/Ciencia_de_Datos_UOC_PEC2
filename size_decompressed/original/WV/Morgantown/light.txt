Large spherical bright lights moving in tandem perfectly horizontally across the sky,7 totatover 1o minutes,hovering stationarry and fa;2012-07-17 22:30:00;10 mintutes;large spherical bright lights moving in tandem perfectly horizontally across the sky,7 totatover 1o minutes,hovering stationarry and fa while walking my dog at approx 1030 pm 7/17/2012,i observed two lights in the sky that were identicle traveling horizontally across the sky.first i thought it was planes,then realized they were too close together and were traveling too slowly. also there was no noise.the lights were pulsating,getting brighter then weaker.they appeared two be large spherical lights,im grossly estimating they were several thousand feet above the ground,and probably several miles away.as they slowly moved horizontally to the left across the sky,they remained an equal distance appart.then they appeared to hover stationarry for several minutes, then the farthest left light slowly faded out,and the one to the right moved further to the left to that some spot and hovered for a few minutes ,then faded out,and as one moved from right to left a new light appeared from the right(from behind a hillside),the lights were all exactly equal in size shape and color and activity.no noise whatso! ever,they always moved perfectly horrizontally across the sky and when they reached the far left point,hovered for several minutes,in exact position,did not sway left or right or up or down,and slowly faded out.and all the while were pulsating equally.a total of 7 lights were seen that traveled from right to left across the sky then faded out.all were exactly the same.and moved the same way,and always maintained equal distance apart.the whole thing lasted approximately 10 minutes.the lights were unusual in that they were large spherical,pulsating,some color change of white to red,equal,and very very slow moving.and that they remained stationary for periods of time.the possibilty exists that these lights were around a large rotating object because of the equal spacing,but only the lights were clearly visible.after 10 minutes the last light faded out and no further lights appeared.no noise at all ever.it was extremely hot this day approx 97 degrees in morgantown,and at this t! ime at night still about 90 degrees and clear skiy.very unusua! lly hot.;39.6246234177214;-79.9446702531646
This light I'm seeing appears to be moving in a short distance back and forth.;2015-04-06 23:28:00;30 minutes+;This light I'm seeing appears to be moving in a short distance back and fourth. At 11:29 pm est, I noticed what appeared to be a bright star.  After focusing on it while lying in bed I noticed it changer colors, mostly white and changed to red several times.   Also, it was moving back and fourth also up and down but in no paticular pattern.  It's moved angled up and down also side to side.  Also the object is flickering.   I used a compass and it is roughly 60 to 63 degrees NE.  I am currently monitoring it now.;39.6246234177214;-79.9446702531646
A flying object, that changed colors from white to blue, would fly straight and pause mid-air.;2017-09-02 22:00:00;1 minute;A flying object, that changed colors from white to blue, would fly straight and pause mid-air. My boyfriend was driving me home one night.  All of the sudden i pointed out a weird glowing object in the sky standing still.  He stopped the car on the road to look at it too.   When the car stopped, the object started moving in a straight line towards  direction, would stop, and fly back to where the object originally was.  When the object would pause in mid-air, it would change colors from white to blue, then back to white.   My boyfriend decided to keep driving and i turned around in my seat to look for the object and it disappeared.;39.6246234177214;-79.9446702531646
