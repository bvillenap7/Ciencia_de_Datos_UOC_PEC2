My family and a few friends were camping on the Cheat Lake in the summer of the late 1970S It had to be around July 1, do not know the exact date.  I was down by the lake when I saw what I thought was a shooting star, but as I watched it,it stoped.  I was puzzled because a shooting star doesnt just stop in mid air.   As I watched it turned into a round glow and started moving very slowly toward us.  When it was streaking like a star it seems very far away, but when it turned into this glow it seemed to be very close very fast, althought it seemed to be moving very slow.  I was so stunned I ran to the boat dock and started yelling for everyone to come and see this.   Then 2 of my sons came running down as the craft started to have pulsating lights that were rotating around the craft.  It stayed! there for a few minutes and then started to move away, when it started to move it turned into the white glow again.  then it was gone.  There was no sound.;39.6246234177214;-79.9446702531646
