Red/orange/blue bolt across the sky..;2006-04-25 12:00:00;20 seconds;Red/orange/blue bolt across the sky.. I can't remember the exact date or time, but it was sometime in the month of April of 2006 i believe.  It was during the day, I was driving to my apartment down Stewartstown Road, as I looked to my right there was a an organish/redish/bluish fireball that went across the sky. It was an amazing sight. Didn't hear any sound. Went by quick.;39.6246234177214;-79.9446702531646
I saw a fireball of green light that was completely silent.;2012-09-20 00:57:00;Around 3 Seconds;I saw a fireball of green light that was completely silent. I was inside of my apartment when I heard what I thought was a helicopter. Walked onto the balcony to see, and saw what I thought to be a firework falling, it was like a bright green fireball. It was silent, made no noise, and disapeared over the horizon. I live near an airport, so I don't believe that the UFO was the source of the noise that I heard at first. Quite frankly I am a little freaked out, the hairs on the back of my neck are standing up. I thought it looked like an asteroid, but it was a perfect circle, with only a short trail of light behind it. Definitely a UFO;39.6246234177214;-79.9446702531646
