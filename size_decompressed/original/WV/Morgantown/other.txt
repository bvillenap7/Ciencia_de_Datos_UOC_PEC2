strange lights above touchdown city, wv  ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.  PD));2004-08-31 20:30:00;1-2 minutes;strange lights above touchdown city, wv me and my friend walked out of a local restaurant between 8:30 and 9 pm.  i looked up and saw what looked like a distorted shaped of the moon shining through the clouds.  but to the left and right of the light, there were stars.  we looked closer, and there wasn't a damn cloud in the sky.  it wasn't until we ligned up the object in the sky with a still standing object, that we discovered it was moving very slowly.  the lights never changed color or patterns or anything, but they also had no flashing port and starboard lights neither, which are required on all commercial air crafts.  the size of this thing was huge.  you know how you can pinpoint the center of light shining through dense fog?  yeah, that light or lights were about 10 - 20 times the size of lights on planes flying across the sky.  as we watched this slow moving ball of light, we noticed the shape sort of resembled a round dumbell.  almost identical to a giant cars headlights in the sky.  now heres the totally weird part.  after about a minute and a half, the oject started fading, as if it was getting further away, or losing light power.  not to sound cynical, but it looked like it was leaving the atmosphere.  i have never seen anything like this before.  i have a witness who saw it all, and we even stopped a guy walking his dog to point it out to him.  i'm really kind of curious as to what it may have been.  please respond.  i took digi photos of the sky, but they came back black, but i'll send them.  maybe you can superimpose...but by the time i got home to get a camera, the object was almost faded out.

Numerous  glowing objects crossing over North side of city, along the same axis as wind direction.  Swirling motion, flickering as if contains flames.  Rising from Monongahela River near water treatment plant, gaining altitude until rising above cloud ceiling.  Maybe scores of smaller hot air balloons?  Or experiment at Engineering campus of WVU?

Entity showed itself next to black mass in Morgantown, WV.;2014-12-09 02:30:00;15 seconds;Entity showed itself next to black mass in Morgantown, WV. Date: 12/9/14 at 230am EST  Location:  Morgantown, WV.  	It was around 230 am EST, I walked to and opened my sliding glass doors on the bottom floor of our house, facing the South West direction.  This is where I smoke, since my wife is pregnant, and I don’t want a smoke filled house.  It is also very common for me to wake and smoke throughout the night.  I proceeded to light my cigarette and was on my smart phone, when I looked up and saw it.  I have a short backyard, about 15 ft, and then it slopes upward at a 45 degree angle for approximately 40 ft, to a road with a newly built vacant house on the other side of the road.  This house always has the outside light on. 	At the top of the hill (in front of the road and vacant house), there was a black box looking mass approximately 8ft long and 6ft tall.  Next to this there was the being, which looked like a classic grey, 4-5ft tall, but long skinny arms.  The being had one arm on the mass as if to be leaning or bracing itself on it.  The being was clear to see due to the light of the vacant house shining behind it (Directly).   This lasted for only 2-3 seconds, as my mind processed what I was looking at, and then my animalistic fear rushed over me like I have never felt before.  I had the immediate feeling the being wanted me to see it, since it was standing directly in front of the vacant house light for me to see.   But when fear and panic shot through my body it quickly darted either into, or behind the black mass (as if it could sense my fear of it).  It moved quit strangely, almost like a sliding mechanical way, smooth, quick, graceful and without a sound.  I have never seen anything living move like this before, which elevated my fear more.   I stood there looking for approximately for another 8-10 seconds and then yelled, “You’re freaking me out”.  I closed and locked the door, turned off the TV and lights, and ran upstairs, jumping into bed with my wife, where I laid awake waiting for sunrise so I could go check out the premises of the sighting.;39.6246234177214;-79.9446702531646
