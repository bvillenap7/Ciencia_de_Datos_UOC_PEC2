I am sorry I dont know the date and am sorry that I am now reporting a 9 year old sighting.  But I finally found your website.  I started getting alot of calls about lights in the sky.  Between songs, I looked out the window and saw them too, creeping slowing across the sky, almost like a blimp, but with many colors, green, red, white, etc.  Continue at full description below... So I watched this large thing with flashing lights slowly move across the sky north of Morgantown West Virginia.  I am undertain of the exact date but I think it was on a warm fall Friday or Saturday night.  The lights were almost in the shape of a triangle, like a fat arrowhead.  They were not perfectly outlining the object but instead appeared somewhat at random.  The object would be stationary, then rise, and then move forward slowly again.  This went on for about 20 minutes.  I even announced it on the radio and I got even more calls from people who also saw it.  Finally, I went back to the window and it was gone about 20 minutes after I got the first call.  That is it.;39.6246234177214;-79.9446702531646

triangle shape with a light on each tip of the triangle. a red light on the top tip of the triangle.;2009-11-08 23:35:00;90 seconds;trianle shape with a light on each tip of the triangle. a red light on the top tip of the triangle. We saw it outside of my window just cruising in the same direction. It had three lights on each tip of the triangle and a red flashing light on the top of triangle. It was going a steady pace and within 90 seconds it was out of sight. It seemed to be going way faster than a plane and flying very steadily.;39.6246234177214;-79.9446702531646
Y-shaped or triangular object in the sky overhead, traveling westward.;2011-08-29 22:50:00;20 seconds;I took my dog outside and stood on my deck shortly before 11:00 PM.  While looking at the stars I observed a Y-shaped or triangular object in the sky overhead, traveling westward. The object had four lights, one at each tip and one in the center.  The lights were not particularly bright but they were steady, not blinking, and appeared white-yellow in color.  The lights were on a solid object that blocked out stars as it passed.  The individual lights were not separate objects.  The object made no sound.  It was difficult to accurately judge size, altitude and speed, but it appeared to be very high and larger than a jetliner. The speed was faster than a normal jet aircraft but slower than a satellite, and much slower than a meteor.  The object did not leave a contrail.   I observed the object for about 15 to 20 seconds, then went in the door and grabbed binoculars from the table. I was back outside in less than ten seconds but the object was gone. There were some scattered clouds but that portion of the sky was clear. The moon was in its new phase and was not visible. I am a scientist and an avid stargazer.  I often watch meteor showers and watch for flyovers of the space station and other spacecraft. This was something unusual that I have not seen before.;39.6246234177214;-79.9446702531646
Triangle shaped BLUE UFO Morgantown West Va;2012-11-15 21:00:00;5 seconds;Triangle shaped BLUE UFO Morgantown West Va Was driving down Mclane Ave in sunny side, morgantown WV.  Looked up in the sky and clear as day i see a neon, glowing Triangular (like a spear-head) light.  It was Blue.  It was travelling at a fast speed,  and as i looked at it, i knew what i was seeing was real because it was a solid object... not just a light blur that we some times get.  No, this was solid, and plain as day a UFO, could not have been anything else. I called 9-11 to report it...  I told the people i worked with i saw it (As soon as i got back to work at the restaurant,  worked nights) and i even asked a couple people on the street if they saw it.  9-11, the people on the street - no one saw or heard anything.  i felt like it was just me..  but,  A couple days later one person i told about it said that she saw someone else talking about it on facebook..  that made me feel a little better.  now recently, about 8 months later it's still on my mind,  so i looked up on this website UFO's seen in WV... and i saw the following posted:  5/30/13 23:30	Charleston	WV	Triangle	10 seconds	Blue Triangle over WV.	7/3/13  Now i know for sure i'm not the only one.....  There's a blue, triangular UFO flying around, and it's as if the person flying it is able to turn it's light on and off..  because again, after seeing it for about 5 seconds, moving fast pace,  it just disappeared in the nights sky..;39.6246234177214;-79.9446702531646
Watching a UFO bigger than a plane ziz zag and dance around without actually leaving its locaton.;2014-10-24 01:00:00;30+ minutes;Watching a UFO bigger than a plane ziz zag and dance around without actually leaving its locaton. I have been watching this thing for 30 min to an hour.  It stays in it's location but moves around in a zig zag or dancing pattern side to side and up and down with actually going anywhere.  It hovers in same spot for long periods.  When a plane was approaching at about the same altitude, it moved up about double and then triple the space above the plane.  After the plane passed, it came back down.  It is now (1:40 am) hovering just above the ridge.  I am between Grafton and Morgantown on Rt 119.  The UFO is in the eastern sky.  When I first started watching it was just to the right of the dipper. It is lower in the sky now and the dipper is up above.;39.6246234177214;-79.9446702531646
