redish-orange glowing sphere;2007-03-29 09:30:00;5-mins;redish-orange glowing sphere Returning from my lunch break, I noticed a red glowing light in the sky about the same level of venus, somewhat to the right of it(almost due north). I commented to my fiance, who was visiting me on my break, about the object. I thought it was Mars, by the redish-orange color of it. However, I didn't remember seeing Mars in the sky near Venus recently. Then the object which had seemed to be setting still in the sky for a minute or so (about two blocks worth of uphill walking)starting moving quickly east. After it had passed about halfway through the sky, we noticed a small line of two or three fading, not blinking, whitish blue lights behind it. Picture a basketball dragging a couple of Christmas lights. These lights made the entire trip across the sky. Maybe not related, but spookyily enough, a helicopter seemed to follow the object just as it was leaving visibility. This helicopter was not the often observed Healthnet medivac.;39.6246234177214;-79.9446702531646

White, orb of light hovers, then darts into Western sky over downtown Morgantown;2014-10-17 20:10:00;2 minutes;White, orb of light hovers, then darts into Western sky over downtown Morgantown Friday, October 17, between 8:10pm and 8:15pm, Morgantown, West Virginia - over South Park area. Large, white orb of light hovers then darts from Northwest sky to Western sky where it disappeared in the distance.  The sky was cloudy, but there is always a great deal of ambient light in our area coming from the downtown area and a nearby mall complex.  My wife was standing on the front porch of our house, looking north-west. She noticed a large, “softball sized,” white orb below the cloud cover.  Possibly 250-400 feet above the ground and maybe four or five blocks north of our house.  It was hovering/hanging in the sky when she first spotted it.   As she tried to comprehend and understand what she was looking at, it darted away, and crossed the entire sky/horizon in under a second.  It did not leave a visible trail or change directions.  At first she thought it was a star or low flying plane, but realized it was a round orb of light.  It dashed across the sky in a straight line, and she thought it traveled horizontally without gaining or losing altitude.  Moved at such a fast speed, she is confident it was not a helicopter, drone or plane.  It had the appearance of a shooting star except it started from a dead stop.  It was also eerily quiet outside that evening and the object made no noticeable noise either while hovering or moving! across the sky.;39.6246234177214;-79.9446702531646
