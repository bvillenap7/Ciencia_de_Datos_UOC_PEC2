Silver craft covered in pentagonal panels in West Virginia;2011-04-22 15:00:00;3 minutes;Silver craft covered in pentagonal panels in West Virginia I was walking my dog, and noticed what appeared to be a bright star a small distance away from the sun in the middle of the day.  I thought this was very odd from the intensity of its brightness. I thought perhaps a planet was visible, but noticed the star was growing brighter and brighter until a small amount of silver began to show in the center. The silver began to expand until a long oval shaped craft was visible. It appeared mayber 1/4th the size of the sun, but I was able to see that it was covered in shiny pentagonal panels that were all reflecting the sun on the side facing it. It appeared to hover silently for a small amount of time before receding into the white light, however as it was leaving i could see the black of space around the curves of the craft until I could no longer see any silver. After the silver of the craft disappeared, I could no longer see any black space, but only the initial white light that shrank in a twinkling dia! mond shaped fashion until it was invisible. The craft appeared to come through some two dimensional portal of light as you could see half the craft emerge from a flat plane of light.;39.6246234177214;-79.9446702531646
