Large Ball of White Light Falling Slowly from Sky;2003-12-08 01:00:00;about 3 seconds;Large Ball of White Light Falling Slowly from Sky I was driving a friend of mine home after work. The sky was clear. It was about 1AM on the dot. As I was driving, I noticed in the top left corner of my windshield a bright ball of light coming almost straight down toward the ground. At first, I thought it was just a drop of water fallind down my windshield, and that a street light had refected on it, making it look luminous. But I was definitely not.  It fell at a constant speed, very slowly. It moved in a straight path, and just slightly toward the left. We were driving, South/SouthWest-ish. It was A bright white ball of light, with no tail at all. I was only able to see it for about 3 seconds or so, from the time it came into my view from inside my car, until it was obscured by some high trees that were along side the road. It looked about the size of the fingernail on my pinky finger if I hold it as far away from me as possible. And my guess would be that it was only a 5 or 6 hundred yards away from us.  I wasn't going to say anything about it to my friend, who was sitting in the passenger seat next to me. But I noticed that he was looking in the same direction, and that he had seen it, also. I asked him Did you see that? And he told me he did, and had no clue what it was.  It moved way too slowly to be a shooting star, and was way too bright, and too large. And it was definitely falling down from the sky, rather than towards the horizon in front of me. I heard no strange sounds.  (I put a checkmark in my report that the object landed, because it appeared to be nearing the ground until it went out of view, but it may not have actually landed);39.3819;-81.453
