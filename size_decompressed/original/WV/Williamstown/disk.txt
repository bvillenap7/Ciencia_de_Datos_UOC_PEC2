There has to be something to this?;2003-12-01 01:00:00;Not Sure;There has to be something to this? My Nephew is 10 years old and lives in Williamstown West Virginia.  He has an extremely High IQ.  He also lack Common Sense like most People with high IQ's do so he is not prone to make things up.   He was around 8 years old at the time of the sighting and was up reading in his room.   He told his Mother and my Mother several weeks later that he was reading when he looked out of his Bedroom Window and saw a UFO hovering above a Soybean field behind his house.  He descriped the object as a Silver Disc making no sound hovering above the field before leaving.   When asked why he did not wake my Sister he could not respond.   I also had an encounter with my family back in the 60's which I reported on the site.;39.3819;-81.453
