Craft hovered over the pond, silently with its lights on.;1975-07-15 18:30:00;4 minutes;Craft hovered over the pond, silently with its lights on. Craft was hovering above a small pond approx 30 feet of the water.  Craft was approx 100 feet in diameter, silver in color, with lights (white/green) on the outer edge around the entire craft.  No sound.  Appeared to be a seam of a door/hatch underneath, but not certain of this. I stood there in awe for approx 4 minutes, then went back down a short trail to tell others.  We returned it wasnt there.  In hind site I wish I would never have left to tell others, maybe I scared it off.  I'll never forget the experience.  It was awesome.  I've told alot of people over the years but most think its all in my head. This was 37 years ago.  Seems like last week to me.
