Unexplained craft rising from the side of the mountain.;2020-11-26 01:34:00;15 minutes;Unexplained craft rising from the side of the mountain. There was 1 saucer shaped craft. I observed it rising into the air and hovering for approximately 15 minutes before I left the area. The craft seemed to be light colored, saucer shaped, with something similar to fire, but white and blue in nature being emitted from the bottom. It almost appeared to have a rocket like appendage on the bottom. It rose rather quickly from the side of a mountain, the same mountain that my husband and I have seen other unusual things come from, and hovered the whole time that I sat and watched it. I sat there for approximately 15 minutes before leaving. I am an currently unemployed teacher with a Master's in Reading Education. I'm 52 years old. I'm a married white female. I do have photos and videos.;38.4832;-80.4476
