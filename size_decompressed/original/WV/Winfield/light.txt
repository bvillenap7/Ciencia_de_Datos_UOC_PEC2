We immediately noticed there were an abnormal amount of planes in the sky, many being in very close proximity.  Around 11 o clock, I saw a white object appear out of nowhere and streak through the sky before  disappearing.  It happened again 15 minutes later, this time we both saw it.  We saw it two more times before we went inside.  Never seen anything like it.;38.5072;-81.89
