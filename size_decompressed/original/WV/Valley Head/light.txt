Friend saw a fleet of 20 objects flying in a very loose formation E/W.   Blinking lights on each - white, red and green, in a square shape…  No sound, but a pulsating vibrating sensation.... Made him uneasy and he went inside… Then he checked to see if they were gone and there were 10 coming N/S underneath the 20 travelling E/W.  Silent.;38.5342;-80.0362
