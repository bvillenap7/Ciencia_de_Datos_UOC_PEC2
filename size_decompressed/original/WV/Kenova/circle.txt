Last night, about 10 pm, I was sitting on the porch of my apartment building, when I saw a bright circular object as big as the moon.  It simply appeared seemingly out of thin air, and was approximately 6 or 7 hundred feet directly above the apartment building.  I only saw it for about 20 seconds and then it just vanished the same way it came.   A minute or so later, I saw, in the same area, what looked like a large number of sparks like you would see when a transformer is arcing, but this was much too high in the sky to be anything terrestrial.  This too, only lasted a few seconds, and then it completely disappeared.;38.3574;-82.5175
