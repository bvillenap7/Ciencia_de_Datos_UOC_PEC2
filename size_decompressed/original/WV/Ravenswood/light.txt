Two bright lights in eastern hemisphere at a 45 degree angle;2007-03-30 21:01:00;1  min;Two bright lights in eastern hemisphere at a 45 degree angle Approximately at 21:01 on March 30,2007 I was sitting by a camp fire in Ravenswood West Virginia  looked up at the sky as I normally do at about a 45 degree angle in the eastern hemisphere I saw two (2) lights they looked like very bright  stars one about an 1 and a ½ above the other. I didn’t think much of it for a moment…I looked back at the camp fire said a few things to my friend next to me, looked back up and both lights were gone.  I told my friend of what I had just seen she watched the sky, as I went in to find out how I could report it to you.  Neither she nor I have seen the lights since. I don’t know how this will help but I thought I would at least report it. Thank you for your time and consideration.
