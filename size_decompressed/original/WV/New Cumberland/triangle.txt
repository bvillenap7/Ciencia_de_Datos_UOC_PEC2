Three red lights forming a triangle in the sky;2012-09-03 21:45:00;10 minutes;Three red lights forming a triangle in the sky On the above date I was driving North On WV Rt. 2 and observed strange lights in the sky. They were glowing red and appeared to be hovering. I pulled off the side of the road and I stopped my car and watched them. The lights seemed to be moving towards each other and in a triangle formation. The lights then seemed to slowly dissapear and then come back. One of the lights in the formation took a quick dive and the shoot straight back up again. At that point, I took out my I phone and proceeded to video the lights. I obtained a small amount of footage before they slowly disappeared.;40.5219;-80.5867

Then we couldn't see it again even though it seemed like it was chasing us.
