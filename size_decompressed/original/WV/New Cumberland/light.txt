High Altitude Bright Light during mid-day;2009-05-18 14:23:00;1 minute;High Altitude Bright Light during mid-day I was traveling north by car on State Route 2 just south of the town of New Cumberland, when I saw a light in the northern sky.  The time was 2:23pm (local eastern) and the sky was clear and sunny.  The light appeared to me to be an airliner at first.  Upon further review, the altitude must have been 100,000+ feet and the distance from my location unknown.  The light did not move in the sky.  The intensity of the light is really what kept my attention it was as bright as the sun.  I did pull my car to the side of the road to watch it because the size vs. altitude was not adding up in my head to be correct.  After about 1 minute, the object turned black/dark grey and seconds later I was unable to locate the object with my eyes.  Even when it turned black/dark grey, the size to altitude ratio would have made the object much bigger than an airliner.;40.5219;-80.5867
