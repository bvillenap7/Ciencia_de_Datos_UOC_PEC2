More than one object can appear always in the same sky location. It is oriented by finding the Big Dipper and the December moon the objects will be between them from the ground location in New Cumberland. The recording of video/audio picks up a humming sound of electronic chatter or interference,it does not seem to affect the video quality.  The event has also happened the following evening and on through the night. Still photos are grainy and show blurring of white with blue lighting.  Have 2 videos of the event as described.  There were 18 completely different objects on the 2nd evening. Have seen these in the past summer but attributed them to the airplane approach to Greater Pittsburgh Airport, but these are not following flight paths or landing approaches, though in the same vicinity. One of the best stills printed reveals a light pattern resembling the outspread wings of a goose in flight, yet it is difficult to say that the object sits between the wings. The observers are security employees used to being awake and alert, and observed this going into 3rd shift.  The 2nd evening of activity was on a night off from work. The observers are 35 to 40 year old white males, with an aversion to being labelled odd or drunk or crazy. Puzzled more than anything else.;40.5219;-80.5867
