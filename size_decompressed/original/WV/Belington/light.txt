Light streak found in pic/video.;2019-07-05 21:37:00;2-3 seconds;Light streak found in pic/video. I was attempting to take photos of fireworks at our county fairgrounds with my phone.  I was reviewing my photos the next day when I noticed the streak of light above left of a single burst.  My son had been video recording the event.   He reviewed his video and found the object 'flash' through approximately 2-3 seconds of video.  Each appearance lasted about 1-2 tenths of second, according to our phone video time counter;39.021;-79.9495
