This object was viewed while looking through a 5 scope to the north of Orion's belt on Saturday 2/22/2014 and was witnessed by my wife and myself.  What I can only explain was an object moving at a fast rate of speed through my field of view.  I was able to track it for a second before passing the scope off to my wife who viewed it but was unalble to follow it. The object moved pass stars in the background and was seemed relativley close to the other objects in field of view.;39.3116;-77.7672
Red and white flashing light over Harpers Ferry, WV.;2015-10-08 21:00:00;4 minutes;Red and white flashing light over Harpers Ferry, WV. The object was almost directly overhead, slightly north/northwest.  Far up in the sky.   It was a bright light that I first thought was a plane, because the light flashed bright white and then a dull red. However, it never moved across the sky.   It just flashed white, red, off, white, red, off, for roughly 4 or 5 minutes.  Then it seemed to shrink in size and abruptly disappeared.;39.3116;-77.7672
