Orange Orb in West Virginia;2009-10-01 19:00:00;2 minutes;Orange Orb in West Virginia Tonight, around seven in the evening, I was driving home from the store when I saw an orange orb to my left. I was driving down Hospital Hill when I saw it. It flew across the sky from my left to my right behind some trees out of my view. Once I arrived at the bottom of the hill, I saw it still flying down Main Street in the Fetterman area above some houses across the street from where I live. It moved rather slow. I watched it fly over a few houses across the street from where I reside and then it just disappeared. The UFO was a rather small orange orb.  It had no other lights on it.  It pulsated an orange glow. It did not make any sound or noise. I parked my car outside my house.  I did not see it reappear.  This is not the first time I have seen an orb in my area.  This is the first orange UFO I have seen, though.  The others were different colors.  I have a few on video if you are interested in viewing them.  However, I was driving this time and did not have my camera with me.;39.3408;-80.0285
