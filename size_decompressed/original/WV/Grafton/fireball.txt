At approximately 10:30, I saw a ball of light travel across the sky.  The light was white and seemed to be traveling SE but then turned South.  As it turned it got much smaller and changed to an amber color. I tried to take a photo but it shows only black.  I was not able to access the camera until the object had changed direction and gotten much smaller. My husband saw a similar object with several other people approximately 2 weeks ago.  It was in Fairmont, WV between the hours of 9 and 11.;39.3408;-80.0285
