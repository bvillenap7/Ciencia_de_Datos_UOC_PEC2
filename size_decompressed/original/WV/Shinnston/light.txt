formation of three lights seen then disappear;2016-05-29 22:20:00;<1 minute;formation of three lights seen then disappear We were driving around 22:20 across Shinnston Bridge.  I asked my husband what was that, and as I pointrd, it disappeared.  I made him drive back to see if maybe something had blocked the view, but it was gone.  I drive that road nightly,  I have never seen anything like this. It was a block of three lights.  Not quite in a triangle formation, but close.   I was so bothered by this I stayed quiet most of the evening.;39.3888;-80.2834
