I thought it was odd because there are no mountains in that area, no land, nothing that there would be a street light, or motor cycle or anything that would make sense.  I told my mom and she slowed down to look, but by the time she finally could, trees were blocking our vision of the aircraft so I had her drive down the road a bit and turn around but it took too long and my mom never saw it, only me.
