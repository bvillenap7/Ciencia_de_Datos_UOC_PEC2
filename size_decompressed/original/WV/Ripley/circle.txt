Me and my little girl was driving down toward WalMart when she looked up and said daddy what is that plane doing going so slow.I looked up in the sky over the hill and this cirlular shape that was moving real slow like the speed of a helicopter but slower was bright aluminum color .Its shape was very distict, then I looked down at the road then looked up again in a clear sky and this shaped just disappeared into thin air.We parked and looked up in the sky and saw a jet and its vapor trail.But this thing moved very slow in the sky and was very hesitant at approxitly a mile upand there was no trail or anying and the sky was perfectly clear.;38.8086;-81.7029
