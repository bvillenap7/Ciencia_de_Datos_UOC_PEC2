They were placed in a straight horizontal line in the sky. They stood still for several minutes.  I called for my Mother to come and see what I was witnessing.  she saw them too.  There was no sound, They were up in the sky several miles away.  (we lived at the tallest point on a street and could see across to the other hills.)The two outside moons  then moved into the center moon.  It did not grow any brighter or larger.  Suddenly, the moon disappeared entirely. Nothing more to add other than at the time this was in the same general direction of the greater pittsburgh airport.  There was absolutely no way these were aircraft as they stood perfectly still and shown like three full moons. They were about the size the moon would be as it rose in the horizon in the east.  That area was quite undeveloped back then. Lots of hills and valleys. sightings of ufo's were pretty common back when I was growing up though most people, my Mom included saw actual crafts.  These moons were the closest I ever got to seeing an actual ufo.;40.4171;-80.5614
