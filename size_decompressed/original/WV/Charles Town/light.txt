I was looking out my bedroom window when I saw a white light streak accross the sky. At first I though it was a meteor because I see them all the time, but I knew what it was when it blinked out and then suddenly blinked back on. It did this three times, in perfect rythym before disappearing over the horizon. It was bright enough to be one of the jets that circles over from the Air National Guard in Martinsburg, however those jets don't go as fast as this object was going and it made absolutely no sound. It couldn't have been a meteor because, obviously, they don't blink out and then suddenly blink back on. It was moving in an east/southeast to west/northwest direction. OK, backround on me. I'm 16 and I'm entering 11th grade. This is NOT a hoax. I firmly believe these things are out there. I've been waiting to see one since I was about six or seven. No kiding!;39.2825;-77.8521999999999
