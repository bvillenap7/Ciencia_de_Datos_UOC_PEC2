About 20 seconds behind them was another flying orange disc.  I had enough time to grab my phone and take a video of it and zoomed in tight.  However, when I zoomed in, the orange disc resembled a fuzzy fireball.   Also none of these flying objects made any sound. ((NUFORC Note:  There is a Charles Town, WV, in addition to Charleston, WV.
