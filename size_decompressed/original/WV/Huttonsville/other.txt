Come fr;2019-10-09 22:00:00;Hour;I was laying in bed my wife said there's a drone outside.  The light went straight in the air.  We saw about 5 blinking lights.  Come from over a near mountain.  We saw 2 in the left of room window.  My wife called her mom that lives less than a mile she confirmed she saw lights.  I then looked through a rifle scope.  At one it had two yellowish lights on each end and a alternating blinking white and red light in the middle.  It changed directions several times.  I viewed another one much farther away in the scope it appeared to be a spinning ball with 3 to 4 blinking lights.;38.6773;-79.9804
