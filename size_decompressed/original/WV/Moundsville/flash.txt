We was watching the sky and then we saw a shooting star.  My friend said he saw another one. I looked over and knoticed it was flashing and moving to the west and it was flashing red, white, and a little bit of yellow. We watched it for about 5 min. It was going up and down. It was about the same hight as an airplane but you couldn't hear it and it wasn't taking the shape of an airplane. After about 15 min. from the first time we saw it it was gone.;39.9122;-80.7295
