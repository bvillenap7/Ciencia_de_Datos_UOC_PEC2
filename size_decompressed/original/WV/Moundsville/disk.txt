UFO sighting Moundsville WV;2007-10-28 20:00:00;2 minutes;UFO sighting Moundsville WV My wife and I are both professionals and we saw a large disk object about 300 meters in diameter in the sky off to the left side of highway 250 South while traveling south to Moundsville WV from Washington PA.  e object had strobe lights around the outer edge which were red, blue, white and yellow.  e object appeared in the sky for 1.5-2 minutes duration before we lost sight of it in the trees.  It was flying at a height which I would suspect small aircraft to fly such as piper planes.;39.9122;-80.7295
