Bright, slow-moving, star-like light;1998-02-08 19:20:00;20 seconds;Bright, slow-moving, star-like light On the date mentioned above, I was observing the night sky with my telescope and a pair of binoculars.  After scannining the sky for a few minutes, I noticed an unusually bright star-like object positioned approximately 40 degrees above the southwest horizon.  I viewed it with my telescope, then with the binoculars.  It then started moving in a northerly direction. After about 5 seconds the light dimmed. It kept travelling north and approximately 15 seconds later, it disappeared.  I know this was not an airplane or helecotper because I have seen them through my binoculars before and they( airplanes and helicopters) move much faster.  There have been reports in the local newspaper by others who witnessed the same thing to call them to discuss this sighting.;39.9122;-80.7295
I was scanning the night sky with 7x50 binoculars when I noticed a light much higher than commercial aircraft usually fly.;1998-06-21 22:10:00;2 min;I was scanning the night sky with 7x50 binoculars when I noticed a light much higher than commercial aircraft usually fly. It was about a star magnitude of +4 or fainter.  It was (or appeared to be) a white light and it moved at a high rate of speed (much faster than any aircraft I have seen).  Approximately 15 seconds after seeing it, I noticed another light with exactly the same characteristics and moving in the same direction.  This is not the first time I was a witness to such an occurance.  Back in February of this year, on two different occasions, I saw a light moving N at a fairly low altitude. I was not the only one im this area to see it.  There was an ad in the local paper to contact this person if the UFO was seen.  I would like to contact this person.  If there are others in my area that witnessed this, please e-mail me at blaknite@ovis.net.;39.9122;-80.7295
