It was moving fast at 4,000 ft to 5,000 ft. Partly cloudy conditions something unusual about this craft it was quite strong bright light he moved in a second 15 degrees and then went straight up in the air till his light went out. No form as we could see just a light. By the way he shut off the light. This report is to the best of my knowledge. ((name deleted));39.9122;-80.7295
