Ive watched them so long and many times they stopped directly above me and trying to snap a picture of one of the statiary ones with my settings fixed to see the sky at night ( camera cant see in the dark without settings adujusting the visibilities) but the camera would not take the picture until the object was gone. they was almost acting as if they was on a recon mission, my family witnessed it, and the clerk at a local gas station witnessed it as well and one of her friends seen these lights all the way past logan, boom county and others, my brother and his girl friend seen them on their drive here. If i was military i would say this is a recon mission befor their invasion of superiority weaponries, ! abilities in battle and from my personal appinion people that think its a spot light from a boat on the river, there is no way that light could reach behind all the houses it did without glaring the houses with light.;38.4163;-81.8311
