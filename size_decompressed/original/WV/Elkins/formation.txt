Told my friend to look.  They were in a perfect snake formation.  Bright golden and star like..   We stopped our vehicle and observed them.  I took video on my phone but you can only see 2 of the objects there were at least 12.  BUT my friend also recorded but i did not see his footage to know the quality considering we were using phones.  They formed a perfect snake like pattern.  Then moved inwards forming something that resembled the big dipper.  One by one they shot into different directions.   It happened so quickly.  But at first they moved slowly.  Very slowly.   Finally there were two left and they flew towards one another and disappeared.  There were other vehicles that spotted it/them as they drove by.;38.9216;-79.8467
