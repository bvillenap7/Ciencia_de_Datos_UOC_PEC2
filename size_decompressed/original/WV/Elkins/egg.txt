Dark gray &quotegg&quot spotted hovering in daytime sky, disappears suddenly;2013-07-19 17:00:00;5 seconds;Dark gray &quotegg&quot spotted hovering in daytime sky, disappears suddenly Driving southeast along Harrison Ave./Rt. 92 in Elkins, I spotted to my right a graphite-colored egg just hovering still in the blue daytime sky.  It was sitting at roughly 2,000 ft. above ground, and I estimate it was about 4 or 5 miles away, south from my location. It would be the size of a pea at arm's length.  I tried to draw my wife's attention to it as she was in the passenger seat, but she wasn't looking in the correct direction and did not see the object.  As I continued driving, I passed some trees which then obscured my view.  Once I emerged into a clear field of vision towards downtown Elkins, the object was gone.  I am very familiar with general aviation and military aircraft, and this did not fit the bill. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));38.9216;-79.8467
