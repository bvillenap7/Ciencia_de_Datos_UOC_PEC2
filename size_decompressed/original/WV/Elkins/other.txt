Strange object in sky near Elkins, wv;2016-08-13 21:30:00;~1 minute;Strange object in sky near Elkins, wv Saw a bright object in sky looked like a star at first.   I was facing south my wife said look at that it is moving, not fast, not slow it was traveling north to south.   As we watched we could tell it was gaining in altitude because it was getting smaller.  The object had no flashing lights or sound.   It disappeared after about one minute, as it disappeared we saw something red in color that I can only relate to as possibly a rocket booster, that only lasted for about four seconds.   I have seen many so called shooting stars and many meteorites this was none of those.   It was a white bright light, appeared to be in the shape of a ball.  When the object disappeared it was instant, from bright white light to nothing, then we saw the dim red light which lasted for about four seconds.
