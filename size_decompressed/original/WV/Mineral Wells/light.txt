Two big bright lights, like headlights on a car but in the sky, shining through the clouds.   There was no sound.  Lights were loated above the treeline on the top of the hill.   My husband tried to walk closer, taking our normally brave dog, but the dog wouldn't budge, pulling on the leash towards the house.  We lost power about 1/2 an hour later.  This morning military helicopters and black helicopters were flying around the area.    mrning the;39.1887;-81.5148
