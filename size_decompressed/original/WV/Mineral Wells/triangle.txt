I was driving home and turned onto Chesterville road when I saw two very bright lights. I remember thinking, I don't remember seeing a tower like that before.  Is it new?  As I drove further and reached the top of the hill I quickly realized that it was a craft triangular in shape and it actually had three lights, one on each corner. It was huge an moved forward with a flat side first rather than a point first.  I was directly under it.  It was also very slow and silent.  I began driving again when I saw another car's headlights come up behind me.  I can't believe they didn't stop.  Was I the only one who noticed it?  I'm only reporting now because I didn't know there was a sight like this.   I don't feel so crazy anymore.   Thanks, UFO center.
