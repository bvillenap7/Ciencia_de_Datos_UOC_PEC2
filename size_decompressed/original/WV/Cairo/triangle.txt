Bright, triangle object in clear November sky over secluded ridge;2005-11-04 04:30:00;Approx. 3 min;Bright, triangle object in clear November sky over secluded ridge It was an extremely clear morning, and I was watching for the Taurids as I waited for my dog to finish his business.  I noticed what appeared to be a satellite, moving west to east.  It was the brightest I'd ever seen, however--brighter than Mars or Sirius.  I watched it cross the sky for a couple of minutes, surprised at its brightness and speed... but when it was close to being overhead (it was slightly to the North, rather than directly overhead),  I realized that it was actually a cluster of three lights, one on top and two below.  Nothing was flashing or blinking, which is why I thought it was a satellite at first the lights were steady and extremely bright.  At this angle, they were distinct. The lower lights were smaller in diameter, but just as bright.  The object seemed too bright to be a satellite.  After another minute or so it disappeared over the eastern horizon.;39.2325;-81.1554
