Rotating in circles and then disappeared after about 15 seconds.;2000-01-20 10:39:00;15 to 20 seconds;Rotating in circles and then disappeared after about 15 seconds. My husband and I went outside to video the lunar eclipse I was looking through my video camera trying to find the moon, and my husband spotted a bright white light in the  south direction of the sky. I proceeded to film the object while my husband was watching it, he later told me that the object (while hovering in one spot) had small individual lights rotating around it. I couldn't see them while filming, because it was a great distance away. The object appeared to bounce across the sky from right to left. The object decreased in size as it slowly faded from view. As soon as it was gone we saw a silver streak zip across the sky to the west. I have an excellent video of the incounter, when put into slow motion the object appeared to have alot of different colors flashing on and off and up in the left hand corner another object appeared that looked to be a beam of light shooting from the first object.;39.2325;-81.1554
