Hovering circular white light with red and green flashing lights.;2003-09-23 21:30:00;10:15;Hovering circular white light with red and green flashing lights. The light appeared (west) almost directly across from Mars over the Ohio River. At first it looked like it was flashing red but when I looked at it through binoculars I could see a green light also flashing. I've seen probably 10 planes and 1 helicopter fly past it. I think it may be a satellite because my cousin in Baltimore can see it, too. I just went outside to take a picture and it has moved far away from my house and I can barely see it now. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a twinkling star is the first possibility that would have to be ruled out, before we could conclude that the witness had witnessed a genuine UFO.  PD));39.2087;-81.6604
