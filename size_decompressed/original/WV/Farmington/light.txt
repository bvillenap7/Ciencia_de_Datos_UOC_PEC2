Small light seen zig-zagging over West Virginia camp;2002-07-10 22:13:00;10 seconds;Small light seen zig-zagging over West Virginia camp I was standing outide waiting for the next event on the shcedule of our summer camp when I turned my head upward. I saw a single, strange, white point of light zig-zagging across the sky. I followed it with my eyes as it zig-zagged. It flew behind a small tree and back into view on the other side. After a few more seconds of zig-zagging, it stoppedfor a second anm then shot off like a bullet, looking just like a strike of lighting blasting thruogh the atmosphere.;39.5064;-80.254
