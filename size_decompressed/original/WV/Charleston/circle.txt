blueish and white orb;2005-12-28 05:00:00;3minutes;blueish and white orb I walked out of my house with my dog, I was waiting on her to use the bathroom and I was looking up in the sky as I always do checking out the winter sky. I saw something that looked like Venus. you know kindof whiteish and blueish  meshing together so you couldn't tell what the true color was. it looked like a planet, until I noticed that it was moving very slowly. It took about three or four minutes to move across the sky.  Later that week I said something to a friend and she said she saw the same thing and she lives 35 miles away. no loss of time or anything like that but it was strange to see something in the sky with no markings, no lights flashing, nothing to id this light in the sky ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Just wanted to see if anyone noticed a pattern from 2014;2014-08-26 22:00:00;20 minutes;Just wanted to see if anyone noticed a pattern from 2014 Back in August of 2014, I witnessed several light changing objects in the sky and also some shadow looking craft flying around the colors.  The reason for my report is because as I was looking over other sightings from that day there where several of the same reports around the same time.  Just curious if you guys put those two things together which im sure you did.  But all the surrounding states on those couple of days had some of the same reports.;38.3594424000001;-81.647724
Larger craft with changing lights with smaller crafts flying around the light.;2014-08-27 00:00:00;30 minutes;Larger craft with changing lights with smaller crafts flying around the light. On the morning of Aug 27th, 2014,.  I was standing on my balcony looking towards the west. I was positioned on elizabeth st looking towards the westard sky.  I saw some strange lights in the sky. I grabbed my binoculars.  There was a stationary object that I was affixed upon that was changing colors from red green and a light white color.  I watched this object for several minutes just changing colors and not moving.  I  called my girlfriend to tell her what I saw.  She came to my apartment and she also viewed the object. I gave her the binoculars and she was focused on the object she pointed out to me that it seemed that several smaller objects where flying around the lights that I hadn't noticed at the time.   She gave me the binoculars and when I observed I saw these much smaller objects flying around where the lights where located.  The smaller objects where moving in such a way that it was not any aircraft ive seen.  Zipping from point to point rapidly this lasted for 30 minutes.  It looked as if they where going around where the lights where blinking.  This smaller crafts didnt have colors they just looked like regular light flying around.  They had no lights the smaller objects.  We observed about 5 to 7 of these smaller crafts around the circular flashing light object.  At the time I was a manager for an furniture company.;38.3594424000001;-81.647724

My aunt is not a nut case, Iâ€™m a none believer, but I have to believe her. She saw 3 round objects that were hovering & changing colors.  And then she heard Something land near her, got scared and ran in her house.  Checked it out the next day and the grass was discolored. I just thought I should report this to someone, my Aunt is the most solid mentally strong Person I know.  If you knew her as I do, you would have to believe her also. To recap: 3 objects hovering over neighbors home and then something landing with a Whipping noise, siting lasted approximately :20.;38.3594424000001;-81.647724
