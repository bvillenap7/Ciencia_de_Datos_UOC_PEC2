V shaped, silent fast moving orb formation.;2011-11-23 22:45:00;10 seconds;V shaped, silent fast moving orb formation. Appeared to be a string of perfectly, evenly spaced round shapes in a triangle formation.  Moving quickly and silently North to South.   No lights, but the shapes were illuminated by the light pollution from the ground.  Around the same distance from the ground as the small personal aircraft I see flying around here from the local small airport.   I have never seen anything like this in my almost 49 years on Earth!;38.3594424000001;-81.647724
Solid triangular lights or light on the underbody;2013-03-01 23:00:00;2 minutes;Solid triangular lights or light on the underbody I am sorry I do not rememeber the exact date, it has been a few weeks back, and it was cold out, I work evenings and went out to smoke, and I always &quot Look- up&quot I seen a few planes high up, (dots of light) and then I noticed a large bright one flying NE- SW, and it looked &quotlow &quot for an airliner etc, as it got closer, I seen it just above the clouds ( moon was out and clouds were illuminated) and it looked huge to be above the clouds and so low at the same time etc... the under body looked as though it had a complete triangle of lights, (it was black or dark in the center of the triangle) and then 2 small flashing lights about  45 degrees or so out from the broadest end or back end points of the object, not touching the triangle, and flashing alternately.  I live near an airport, and a national guard location, and I have never seen a craft like this.  It made no sound at all. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));38.3594424000001;-81.647724
Blue Triangle over WV.;2013-05-30 23:30:00;10 seconds;Blue Triangle over WV We were driving through the mountains of West Virginia and headed into Charlotte on our way to Kansas City to pick up a puppy we bought.  It was getting late and we were going to stop to sleep. It was night, and my British husband and I were looking off into the night horizon on the highway I64 West. When a haloed blue 3 light triangular shaped aircraft appeared out of nowhere, that didn't seem odd at first to me as I assumed it was a plane until it moved.... It moved down and and back up so fast that no human aircraft could have done that, in almost a U shape then it disappeared into thin air.  A plane flying away will gradually FADE out of your vision....not just simply vanish.  We didn't and still don't know what to think.;38.3594424000001;-81.647724
Lights appeared in a triangular shape.;2013-08-31 00:03:00;2-3 minutes;Lights appeared in a triangular shape. On August 31st, 2013, I was on my way home from work.  I noticed a Single light in the sky going perpendicular to the car.  Suddenly, the light did a 90 degree turn and began going parallel to the car.  Two more lights appeared along with the first forming a triangular shape just as it did the 90 degree turn.;38.3594424000001;-81.647724
