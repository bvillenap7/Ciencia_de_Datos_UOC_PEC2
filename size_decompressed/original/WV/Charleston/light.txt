Large craft spotted west of I-77;2009-07-10 00:35:00;Few minutes;Large craft spotted west of I-77 Object was spotted west of I-77 just past the stadium in Charleston WV.  It was unclear if it was a singular object with several lights or rather several objects with singular lights but I am more inclined to believe the first.  It was hovering for a few moments and disappeared just as I went to take a picture. Lights were there and then gone without a trace.

Glowing ball rose from the mountain, flew towards us, hovered above us for about 30 seconds, flew left, and vanished into thin air.;2012-07-04 00:00:00;~10 minutes;Glowing ball rose from the mountain, flew towards us, hovered above us for about 30 seconds, flew left, and vanished into thin air. A man in my grandmothers apartment complex warned us about a white light. We assumed he was just drunk.  Not even 5 minutes later, we heard a crash in the mountain that was literally 1 mile away. We saw a bright ball of light rise from the mountain.  It flew towards the apartment, hovered above us for about 30 seconds, flew left, and vanished into nothing.  It didn’t function like a star.  It didn’t make noise.  It didn’t flask.  To this day we don’t know what it was.;38.3594424000001;-81.647724

Approximately 10 lights located high in the sky traveling simultaneously NW to SE.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-28 21:19:00;About 2 minutes;Approximately 10 lights located high in the sky traveling simultaneously from northwest to Southeast,  lasting almost 2 minutes I was sitting outside with a small fire, watching stars. I live in the direct line of the airport in our area so I’m used to seeing planes go by. What I saw tonight were not planes. They were high in the sky almost resembling stars, they had no color other than white and  flew in a straight line at the same speed in the same direction simultaneously. I watched for about a minute then went and got my husband and son becasise I just couldn’t believe or explain what I was witnessing. I counted 6 but didn’t start counting until I realized it was something very strange. I used a compass and to the best of my ability I calculate that they were going from the northwest to the southeast. The whole thing lasted maybe two minutes before I lost sight of them over the mountain.;38.3594424000001;-81.647724
