Pulsing random light in random positions beneath Jupiter.;2016-04-09 23:00:00;10 minutes;Pulsing random light in random positions beneath Jupiter The UFO appeared under the planet Jupiter in the sky.  A light began to grow slowly out of the darkness, taking about one second to reach a luminosity equal to or brighter than Jupiter.  It would then fade out to black in the same amount is time.  It would then repeat this over about six more times but appearing in random nearby areas, but not leaving time for an airplane or helicopter to reach each position of the growing bright and fading light.;38.3594424000001;-81.647724
Blue Flash making quick maneuvers in the sky;2021-05-28 00:20:00;1 Second;Blue Flash making quick maneuvers in the sky At roughly 20 minutes pass midnight on May 28th I observed an object traveling at very high speed fly at an arc several hundred feet from the ground and go out of my line of sight. The speed was similar to a jet making quick maneuvers at low altitude. The object was mostly a blue flash glowing bright, but the center looked more of a solid object. There was also no sound made by the object.;38.3594424000001;-81.647724
