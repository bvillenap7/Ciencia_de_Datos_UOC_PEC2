Single white cross shaped craft, hovering high overhead, clear sunny sky.;2017-03-18 13:20:00;2  minutes;Single white cross shaped craft, hovering high overhead, clear sunny sky. Charleston, West Virginia, on Kanawha Boulevard, standing on the south side of the Capital building, on the sidewalk that runs next to Kanawha River. I was facing west, it was very bright and sunny sky. I noticed what I thought was a jet very high overhead.  Then I realized it was not moving at all, and was not jet-shaped as I had thought.  It was a  white symmetrical cross, what is referred to as a “Greek cross”. It sat there not moving, there were no con-trails, or any other indication of movement.  Then it turned clockwise.  It sat there for a bit longer and then cruised at an average speed, stopped, then darted very quickly to the northwest, then darted again southwest. It did not move like an airplane, jet or helicopter.  It darted very quickly at angles.  Then it just disappeared.;38.3594424000001;-81.647724
