I was lying in a hammock in my back yard, near Kanawha State Forest. From the direction of the forest moving toward South Hills came a craft shining lights of red, white and possibly another color.  The lights were moving wildly, the craft made an unusually quiet noise like an amplified insect, and it moved quickly but gracefully towards my house in a way that no helicopter could.  I ran inside, afraid. The noise was audible for a minute from inside the house, then gone.  An unusually large shooting star hit the atmosphere a minute or so after the noise disappeared.;38.3594424000001;-81.647724
Bright light entering cloud with major lightning activity and disappearing.;2012-03-19 06:20:00;20 seconds;Bright light entering cloud with major lightning activity and disappearing. I was sitting outside letting my dog do her business. There was very odd lightning to the NorthEast of my location, just south of Charleston, WV.  I have seen strange things in the sky before, and I know what meteorites look like, I know what satellites look like, stars, planets, etc.  The closest thing I xan compare ot to was that it looked about the same relative brightness as Venus has looked lately. Venus has been quite bright and this objects was as well.  It seemed to just appear, and looked to be going SW to NE, although it was at least as far away as an airliner flying around 25-30' ft. _t was moving faster than a Jet though anwas headed straight toward the small spot in the sky that had the strange lightning.  It never changed direction much but once it got into the cloud with the lightning it seemed to vanish without a trace.  Very shortly thereafter, the lightning stopped as well.  It was all very strange and had me very intrigued.  This is my first post ! here because it is the first time I have seen something I felt truly significant enough to post. I believe there was a correlation between the object and the lightning.;38.3594424000001;-81.647724
Strange Set of 2 Lights In The Sky Located Off Campbells Creek Drive, Charleston WV;2012-09-16 22:20:00;15 minutes;Strange Set of 2 Lights In The Sky Located Off Campbells Creek Drive, Charleston WV At approximately 10:20pm on 9/16/12 I saw an object in the sky just to the east of Charleston WV.  I could not make out a shape of this as it was off in the distance but stationary.  I saw sequenced white lights blinking on and off around this object and every few seconds a red light would blink on / off to the left of the white lights.  I watched this for approximately 3 to 4 minutes.  Then I noticed another identical set of lights doing the same thing further off to the east just above a tree line.  These lights were also stationary, not moving, just the blinking on and off.  Both objects were visible for duration of at least another 5 minutes or so.  I was out walking my dogs on this night as I watched these objects.   After the 5 minutes or so pasted the first set of lights that I had originally seen just disappeared.  I don’t know how else to explain it.  They didn’t fly off, or shoot up in the air, they just disappeared like whomever was operating the ! object had shut them off.  All during this time I truly was trying to figure out what I was actually seeing.  At first I thought it was a hovering helicopter looking for something.  When the second set appeared I was trying to remember if there was a tower nearby with a light on top for incoming or outgoing aircrafts to Yeager Airport in Charleston.  I assure you there was not.  First thing the next morning I drove down Campbell’s Creek Drive where I was standing when I saw these things and there was no tower above the hilltop where the second set of lights was seen.  After discussing this tonight with my husband I decided to report this to you.  This is the first time I had ever seen anything like this in my life and I am 43 years old!  When I came back inside that night from walking the dogs, the second object was still visible in the sky.  I had observed it all together for approximately 10 to 15 minutes.  I heard nothing during this time, no engines or motors running.  ! It was very quite outside.;38.3594424000001;-81.647724
2 bright lights seen flying over Charleston, WV.;2013-07-07 21:50:00;2 minutes;2 bright lights seen flying over Charleston, Wv The UFO was as high as an airplane.  I thought it was a plane until I realized there weren't any flashing lights.   I couldn't make out the shape because it was dark.   It had 2 big, bright lights & moved slow.  The whole experience lasted maybe 1-2 minutes before I lost sight of it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD));38.3594424000001;-81.647724
