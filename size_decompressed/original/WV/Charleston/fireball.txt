It was about the size of the full moon and looked much brighter. A bright green fireball with green sparks trailing it, streaked across the sky for about 5 seconds.  It was approximately the size of the moon but brighter.  The sky was clear with just a few scattered clouds.  For a moment the object passed behind a medium sized cloud and lit up the cloud like a light bulb.  The fireball seemed to be flying parallel with the ground.  I've saw hundreds of shooting stars and this was nothing like anything i have ever saw.  I hope i didnt leave off any important information.  This was the most unbelieveable thing i've ever saw in the night sky.  :);38.3594424000001;-81.647724
