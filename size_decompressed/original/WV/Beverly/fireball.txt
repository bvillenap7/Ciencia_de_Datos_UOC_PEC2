I was leaving home for work, going from unincorporated community of East Dailey, Randolph County, to Elkins.  As I was driving alone crossing the bridge of the Tygart Valley River heading north and toward US219, I suddenly observed a bright light going from West to East like a fireball or sphere (cirular about the size of a basketball if up close).  The treelines hindered my view somewhat but it only lasted about a minute or several seconds.  It was very bright and moved very rapidly and would have appeared to be over Beverly looking toward the distant horizon.  This was very unusual and really caught my attention.;38.8299;-79.8706
