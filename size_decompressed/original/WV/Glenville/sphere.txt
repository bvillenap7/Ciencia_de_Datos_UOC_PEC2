Orage orb over Glenville WV;2008-04-10 01:30:00;3-4 minutes;Orange orb over Glenville WV The sighting occurred around 1:30amEST. Four individuals on a hillside in central WV were present. The sphere was first noticed by one individual and then all four turned their attention to it. The sphere seemed to be high in the sky, but was roughly the size of a pinky nail at arms reach. The sphere could be seen over the top of a far building and moved almost parallel to that line. It however moved slightly up as it traveled towards the northern sky. It continued this course for 3-4 minutes before beginning to climb more. At this point something occurred at ground level diverting all attention there. When attention was returned to the skunk the orb was gone. It could not be explained as to where it might have gone or what it might have been. Certain things such as an individual on the roof of said building have been ruled out though.;38.9417;-80.8338
