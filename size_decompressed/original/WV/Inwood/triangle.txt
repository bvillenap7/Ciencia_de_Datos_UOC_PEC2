Orange triangle with flames from tail shooting through sky above tree line;2012-08-08 23:30:00;10 seconds;Orange triangle with flames from tail shooting through sky above tree line Around 11pm on August 8, 2012, I came outside to smoke. I just happened to look up into the sky and see an orange triangle (best described as the shape of a typical paper airplane) flying through the sky at tree line level. It seemed to have flames coming out of the back of it.   The entire object was the color of fire.  I guess it looked like a paper airplane (triangle) on fire, shooting through the air.  It moved very fast and disappeared behind a tree. I waited for it to emerge from behind the tree and it did not. I did not see it again.  About 10 seconds after this sighting, I saw two bright consecutive flashes in the distance.  The night sky on this evening was VERY clear. I immediately went back inside, as I was a little spooked and alone with my infant son.  I remained inside for the duration of the evening.;39.372;-78.0231
