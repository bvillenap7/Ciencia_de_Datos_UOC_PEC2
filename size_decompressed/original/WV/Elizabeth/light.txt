Bright light shooting across the sky.;2014-07-09 20:00:00;1 minutes;Bright light shooting across the sky. I went out to get my kids stuffed animal from the car, and as i looked up into the sky i saw a bright light speeding across the sky faster than any plane or craft i have ever seen fly over before.  There was no sound at all and out of all the planes i have watched many nights and all the shooting stars i have seen this was different in many ways.  The amount of distance that was covered in the short amount of time was faster than any jet i have seen on air shows, it was just different.  It was a bright light no sound and just constant speed until it vanished across the sky.;39.0567;-81.4009
((HOAX??))  Looked like a star that moved across the sky and flashed a white light and was gone.;2017-08-31 22:00:00;13 seconds;looked like a star that moved across the sky and flashed a white light and was gone. I saw a light that looked like a star at first, because it was so high up in the night sky, until it started moving.   After a few seconds it seemed to flash right at me like someone was shining a flashlight in my direction from way up in the sky and then it was gone.   I was shocked and had to ask myself if my mind was playing tricks on me. ((NUFORC Note:  For some reason, itness indicates that the date above is approximate.  PD);39.0567;-81.4009
