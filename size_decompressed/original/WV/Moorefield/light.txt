They would sometimes completely reverse direction or zig zag through the sky occasionally completely stopping. Not going insanely fast but faster than any airplane I've seen. Sometimes disappearing but rarely, most just fly out of site behind mountains. Seemed like they all left the area at the same time. Also I could not get a single one in a video or picture but can see stars perfectly fine in them.;38.9925;-78.9769
