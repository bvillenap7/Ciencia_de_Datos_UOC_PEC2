I walked outside onto our deck and saw 2 large yellow lights traveling in a Northwest direction in the sky.  Each of them had a red strip of light on the undersides. Both lights came from the Southeast and traveled at a speed and distance equidistant from each other.  They both suddenly stopped, hovered briefly, and then traveled in a Northern direction for a short distance, keeping the same separation distance as when I first saw them. They suddenly stopped again, hovered briefly, and then one traveled in an Eastward direction,  away from the other, toward the town of Lewisburg, for a large distance and then fizzled out disappeared. The second one remained hovering for a short period of time and then elevated upward and fizzled out and disappeared like the first one.;37.9636;-80.7793
