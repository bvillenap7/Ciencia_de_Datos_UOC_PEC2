The sighting took place sometime between 11:00 and 11:18 pm.The time of the sighting is unsure.I only saw it for about 45 to 90 seconds.It then dissapeared.The object was a little larger than an average sized star that was in the sky.It was white and yellow colored and was outlined in green at certain times.It was a very clear night with lots of stars in the sky and a full moon.My dog was acting very out of character and hyper all night so I went to check on him and thats when I seen it.Other dogs in the neighborhood were also barking.When it dissapeared it got smaller and smaller turning very dark yellow before eventually dissapearing all together.I don't think it was an alien space craft or anything but it was surely a strange sight.It was spotted in the northern sky towards hagerstown md along interstate 81 near a radio tower.
