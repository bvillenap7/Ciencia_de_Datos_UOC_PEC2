As the object headed for the treeline, we noticed that it appeared to be a triangle shaped craft that was facing Northwest.  We were looking at it fly away from us until it passed over the tree line at which point it was no longer in view.   No blinking lights, sound or anything.  It was definitely in our atmosphere and was not a satellite, shooing star or aircraft.  As I am a regular astronomer and can almost always tell the difference.  I would estimate the hight at 80000 feet and traveling about 1000 miles per hour.;39.5865;-77.8852
