Fireball like object seen in sky from Weston WV.;2020-09-24 22:15:00;1 minute;Fireball like object seen in sky from Weston WV. At approximately about 10:15pm EST on Thursday 9-24-2020, as me and my daughter were out on our back porch talking,  a large fireball like object , was spotted in the sky north east of Weston, WV.  The object was seen rising in the north eastern sky, seeming growing larger, and then it floated towards the north for several thousand feet, and then seeming to fly off into the North Eastern sky.  All of this happened within about a minute of time. The fire ball from our prospective was much larger than any stars or planets in the skies. With the cloudy conditions in the area, made the planets of Jupitar, Saturn, and Mars are hard to see. I am an avid sky watcher and even checked the Fight24 Radar app to see if there were any planes in the skies above us, and in that time there wasnâ€™t anything over the skies of Weston for a 40 mile radius.;39.0411;-80.4737
