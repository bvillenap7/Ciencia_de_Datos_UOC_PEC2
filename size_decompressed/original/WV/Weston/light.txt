Sighting going north from south very slowly, distance about a 1ft to 2ft in length. It was traveling around 15 to 20 seconds. Object very bright white light, no flashing, and no other colors. After object went out of view, seen possible what look like a meteor shower, but they were going in different directions. Tried to establish distance by how far the planes were flying above the object.  If this were just a meteor shower and the International space station flying over, from seeing other meteor showers before.  It seemed to me that most showers tend to cross in the same direction. Just struck me as odd and thought I would call someone that had more insight. Thank you for your time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
