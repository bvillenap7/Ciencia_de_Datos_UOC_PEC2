There was going to be a meteor shower so my we got up and went out in the back yard to watch it. So me my dad and my brother are sitting there watching to the south because that seemed like where most of the shooting stars were. Then my dad says Whats that, so I turn and I see this very bright light shining on us. It shined on us for maybe 7-8 seconds and the light went out. It then just looked like a satelite. It then moved slowly NW but stopped after a few seconds but did not make any turns or anything like a plane. It just stopped and started moveing back the direction that we first spotted it at. It then headed SE stopped and another beam of light came down when it was over the town of Aurtherdale, which we can see from are house. It was the most perfect beam of light I have ever saw in my life. Whatever it was it was very high up but had no problem for that light reaching the ground. I know it lit up the ground when it shined it on us. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
