((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-16 21:32:00;9 minutes;While looking north I witnessed 3 dim starlike lights traveling from west to east in a triangular configuration.  These were followed by 21 similar lights in single file traveling in what appeared to be the same direction and speed.  They were spaced approximately one hand width apart held at arms length.  They were observed to be close to the same distance above the horizon as Venus.  3 Of the objects flared to almost the brightness of Venus briefly. I was near a running brook during this observation so it's difficult to say for sure if the objects made noise.;37.593;-80.3407
