Bright oval light floating through the sky in a straight line.;2012-05-22 03:35:00;20 Seconds;Bright oval light floating through the sky in a straight line. I witnessed one oval flying object, floating through the sky slowly. It omitted a bright white light that seemed to be shining up and down, almost straight.  The light shined brightly through the fog, and seemed to pulsate up and down.  For around 20 seconds, I watched it float steadily, making no sound. It then seemed to vanish.;38.6549;-80.6785
Football shaped object, with dull white light hovering over Exchange, WV.;2015-06-22 23:45:00;10 minutes;Football shaped object, with dull white light hovering over Exchange, WV. Went outside to check garden.  It was clear.  I noticed a weird object in the sky.  It was shaped like long football, and was moving northwest. It was noticeably lower than the stars.  It emitted a dull, white light all around it.   My mother came out and watched it, and at one point it stopped for about 1 minute then dropped below the tree line.;38.6549;-80.6785
