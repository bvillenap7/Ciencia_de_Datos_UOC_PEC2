We were driving North on I79 toward Clarksburg, when the incident occurred we were about 1 mile from the Summersville/ Rt 19 exit.  We observed a large circle shaped object sink down from the sky for 4 of the 5 seconds that the sighting lasted.   After sinking slowly for 4 seconds it shot off rapidly to the left, horizontally and disappeared.  In comparison it looked as though the object was 1/2 the size of the moon.   The center of the object was dark and around the edge was a glowing white light.;38.6549;-80.6785
