AS WE WERE DRIVING, MY WIFE SCREAMED AND SAID LOOK AT THE SKY!  AS I LOOKED, I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE TAIL END OF A FIREBALL AS IT RIPPED THROUGH THE SKY.  MY WIFE WATCHED IT THE WHOLE TIME WHEN IT APPEARED.  I TOLD HER IT WAS PROBABLY A SHOOTING STAR, BUT SHE SAID IT GLOWED BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER, AND IT ALSO CHANGED DIRECTIONS.
