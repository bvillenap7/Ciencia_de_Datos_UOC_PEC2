Triangular UFOs spotted in Chester, West Virginia.;2015-03-20 13:00:00;3 minutes;Triangular UFOs spotted in Chester, West Virginia. Around 1:00am on the morning of March 20th, 2015, my two sons and myself saw a triangular shaped aircraft fly over the treeline behind our house.  It had three points.  The two points in the back were white and the point in the front was green.   It hovered over the trees for about 30 seconds before flying away at an excellerated speed.  Three minutes later we saw another one fly by, without stopping, and it looked identical to the one we saw only minutes before.;40.6003;-80.5607
