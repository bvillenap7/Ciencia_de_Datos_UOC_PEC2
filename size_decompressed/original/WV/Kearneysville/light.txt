They appeared to be moving mch faster than an airplane and in perfect fromation.  As I was watching them move infront of me I noticed the first light had a tail like a comet and then within an instant they were moving so quickly that they totally disappeared although it was a prefectly clear night sky. I am a 44 year old, registered nurse and I was driving to a friend's house after work. I was looking out the driver side window of my car when I saw 4-5 bright red lights low in the sky.  At first I thought it was a large plane getting ready to land at the Martinsgurg airport because it was in that direction and there are large planes that land there.  But the lights were far enough apart that it grabbed my attention and I thought  that is a VERY large plane.  At that point the lights appeared to make a sharp turn very quickly so that they were suddenly in front of me at a height that I could see them straight out my front wind shield.  They were all evenly spaced and looked about the size of lights you see on an airplane when it is about 500 feet up and the first light had a tail like a comet.  I slowed my car to watch it as did the car infront of me. Then the lights disappeared and there was no trace of the lights and I looked and looked for them.  I looked at my car clock so that I could document the time and it was 7:05pm. It was a prefectly clear night.  I have a fasination with watching the sky day and night and have seen many meteors, satalites, etc. and nothing has looked like this.  When I got to my friends house I told him what I saw.;39.323;-77.9544
