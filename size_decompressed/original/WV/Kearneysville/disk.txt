Silver colored saucer with dark trim around the bottom and top/middle.;2012-07-09 13:00:00;5 minutes;Silver colored saucer with dark trim around the bottom and top/middle. Siting Information- I spotted this unidentifiable object at around 1:30pm. I watched it until I could no longer see it, which was about 5 minutes. It had been hovering around in the sky and made no noise. It descended some, moving to right, then left, and afterwards it started to ascend until it was no longer visible. It was a hot and cloudy/sunny day during the siting and in a quiet farm area.  The object seems to have a trim on the bottom and middle/top.;39.323;-77.9544
