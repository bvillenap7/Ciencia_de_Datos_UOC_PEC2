5 or more orange lights.;2013-11-30 22:30:00;5 minutes;5 or more orange lights. While out walking the family dogs I had noticed a slow moving orange light.  It moved from south to north in a fairly straight line.  No noise at all.   Initially, I thought that it may be a falling star or something burning as it entered the atmosphere.  Then a second one appeared.   I went  inside and got my wife. We watched a couple more that looked exactly the same follow the same path.  Each time flying over us and then off to the distance and then disappearing.   My wife then went in and got our two daughters. (18 and 21)   We live on a farm and there was no noise to be heard.   We all watched as a couple more flew over.  Total there were at least 5 or 6.  I have lived here for 17 years and am out about the same time each night.  This is the only time that I had seen something like this.   Have no idea what it could be, one, perhaps even two falling stars, but not six that were identical in size and shape following the same path.   Not to mention that the flight of each lasted for a couple minutes.;39.323;-77.9544
