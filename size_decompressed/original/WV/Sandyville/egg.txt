Red Glowing Blimp-Like Object Hovering over a field;2001-10-02 06:50:00;5 min or so;Red Glowing Blimp-Like Object Hovering over a field On Oct. 2nd, 2001, approx. 6:50-6:55 am....my sister and nephew were driving out their dirt road, in Sandyville, WV.  My nephew was the first to see the object, yelling at my sister to stop the vehicle, etc.  She didn't at that time.   Then, as they traveled a lil further, he saw it again, pointing and tellign her to pull over. She did.  She describes the object as this:   Blimp-Like object....smooth...no ribbling or lines like a blimp.  RED..Bright Red...glowing red...(it was an overcast cloudy day, no sun), she said it had black square things on the bottom...several.   There were two doors that were open, like barn doors....that had a V-shaped item come out, and that had 6 circles on each side of the V.....Said it didn't move. No noise...nothing. They watched it for like 5 min.  Said it intrigued her, yet sorta scared her.   She said she went to drive a lil further down the road, and took her eyes off it, and so didn't my nephew, and when they looked back...it was gone.  That fast. Being how a blimp cannot travel that fast....she was really skeptical about mentioning it.   However, since my nephew as well, saw it, she said, it was hard not to tell someone. So, she told my mother and I, and I told her to report it.  She hesitated, and then finally decided she wouldn't, but said I could. Soo, I am reporting it.  Personally, i have a feeling its Military related....with all thats going on.  She is totally shocked.   She did however draw a picture of it....and as well as my nephew. Thanks for your time.;38.9099;-81.6513
