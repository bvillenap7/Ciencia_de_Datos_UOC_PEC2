(im not sure if those 2 are the same thing) but then it stated moving. Much too slow to be a shooting star. much too fast and the light was too bright for it to be a distant plane. it made no sound whatsoever until it disaapeared oer the trees north of us.

2 orange lights in Beckley, WV moving east to west staying just above tree line and moving at the speed of a plane;2017-08-19 21:00:00;3 minutes;2 orange lights in Beckley, WV, moving east to west staying just above tree line and moving at the speed of a plane I was inside with my mother and my father was outside on the porch talking to one of our neighbors.  My father called to us come and look at this my mother and I went out side.  He pointed to the sky and just above the tree line ther were two orange lights moving east to west.  The lights were sort of far apart and stayed near the tree line while moving about the speed of a plane.  They were gone pretty quickly;37.7921428571429;-81.2050200000001

Lighted object flies directly at United 1520 and makes sharp maneuver.;2021-06-19 23:30:00;2 minutes;Lighted object flies directly at United 1520 and makes sharp maneuver. On the night of 19 June 2021 around 23:30 local time, myself and my son were watching aircraft pass over the BKW airport navigational beacon and corresponding them with the ADS-B data from FlightAware. As we were observing United Airlines Flight 1520 pass Beckley from the SW to NE, a single white light with no other lights visible traversed on the inverse path of UAL1520 from the NE to SW headed directly towards UAL 1520. It appeared to be at a higher altitude than UAL1520. Upon reaching UAL1520 as we observed from directly underneath the two, the light made an immediate and abrupt turn NNW. It was so abrupt and perfectly sharp, a near 90-degree turn. Both my son and I decided that no craft short of a military flight could make this sort of maneuver. Confirming MLAT data with ADS-B exchange, we have confirmed that there are no known military flights in the region that would be apparent to us.;37.7921428571429;-81.2050200000001
