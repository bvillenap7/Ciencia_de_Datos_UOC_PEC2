Kanawha St about 8:45. My friend and I suddenly saw a huge glowing flourescent green flash shooting down from the sky. There seemed to be a glow around it. There was a slight arch trailing behind it and then it suddenly shot straight down over the mountain. There was no trail and tracers, just a glowing arch. This is nothing that I've ever seen before. The color was unremarkable and unusual. There was total silence. I thought some kids were on the golf course doing some unusual fire works. It lit up the sky. I talked to a friend of mine about 9:30. I had forgotten about the incident. He told me, I saw the strangest a few minutes ago... His discription was the same as mine ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports of the same object.
