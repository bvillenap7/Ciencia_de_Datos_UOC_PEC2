Me and my brother-7 and 13 years old at the time-were playing near an old abandoned train tunnel about a half-mile from our home, when my brother suddenly pointed up to the sky. Together, we saw a large, cigar shaped object moving very slowly above the tunnel. I am not sure how high the object was above the ground, but it was close enough to see detals of the object clearly. I would guess it was about 100 feet long, and clearly metalic with no markings that we could see. The thing that stands out in my mind the most was that there was absolutly no sound whatsoever. Neither did we see any windows or other openings. It was simply a solid, highly reflective object, that moved quietly above the tunnel at a very slow but constant speed. We watched the object for about 5 minutes, until it disappeared on the other side of the tunnel. We tried to find it again, but we could find no trace of it after that.
