No visible wings, rudder or means of pulpusion, no sound. No visible windows, no markings, no flashing lights. The pureist silver I have ever seen, almost like a mirror. There were 15-17 people present and all of us saw it. From my location it was about 75 to 80 degree angle. As it passed from our view into clouds, the sun could be seen reflecting off of it until it passed completely from our view.;37.8479;-81.9961
