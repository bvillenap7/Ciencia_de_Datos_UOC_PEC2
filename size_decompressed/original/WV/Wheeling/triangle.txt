Huge triangular light formation.;2000-04-28 21:00:00;30 seconds;Huge triangular light formation. Was driving up Bethany Pike towards Ogleby Park and spotted an odd, triangular formation of lights that appeared motionless and low in the sky.  The size was rather large (about the same size that a commercial aircraft looks when it first takes off and flies over you).  Lights on the craft were several colors.  There were at least 3 that formed a triangle shape and 1 in the center.  Was quite an impressive sight.;40.1041;-80.6424999999999
