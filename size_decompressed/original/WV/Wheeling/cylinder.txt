Dark, slow moving Cylinder  overhead in a  clear sky ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting by astronomer.  PD));2003-08-15 21:30:00;app 2 min;Dark, slow moving Cylinder  overhead in a  clear sky Although this sighting has been over a year ago, it is still fresh in my memory.  I was observing the Ring Nebula in Lyra with my 8 Orion reflector telescope and as I looked up at the sky I saw a very slow moving object heading east to west. I first spotted it coming from the Northern Cross and followed it across the sky till it disapppeared over the western horizon. My best view of it was in the Constellation Hercules. The object was Cylinder shaped, dark gray or black finish. I saw no reflection or any lights on it. I am guessing at altitude but would say about 1500 ft. I did not see any wings, tail fins or engine pods and it was silent. My first thought was that it was a blimp but ruled that out. Not sure of length but appeared larger than the Goodyear Blimp  I don't consider myself an amateur astronomer, but have been observing the night sky  since I was in High School( over 40 years).
