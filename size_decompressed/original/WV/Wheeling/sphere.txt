They would slow down and speed up.;2004-07-21 18:15:00;5-10 minutes;It was sunny out and i was walking down town, when i decided to look up at the sky. Well there were two spherical objects. Just gliding (floating) side by side. They would slow down and speed up. And when one would get to far away from the other it would stop until the other one would catch up. Almost like they were attatched together by a string. I know they were pretty small because at that time a low flying jet passed by and they were about as big as its cockpit. This lasted a good while. But then I lost them in the clouds. Were they weather ballons or something else, I have no idea. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
