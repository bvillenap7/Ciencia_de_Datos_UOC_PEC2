Blinking lights, spinning in a circular rotation.;2016-11-29 22:47:00;10-20 seconds;Blinking lights spinning in a circular rotation. I was driving around a bend and saw the flashing lights and object moving as soon as I turned the corner.  While continuing to drive, the object was still moving.  Once I slowed to take a better look at the object, I came to a stop and watched the object move anywhere from 30-50 feet.  Then after that, I sky lit up and the object was gone.  I didn't mention earlier, but there were deer spread across the field.  This makes me wonder if the object was examining for cows and once examining all objects in the field, it vanished away.;39.2991;-80.2429
