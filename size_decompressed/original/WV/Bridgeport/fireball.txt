On the night of November 4th, 2015, around 8 PM, I saw what I thought to be a UFO.   Straight ahead in the distance about a couple miles away appeared three glowing balls in a straight line which was moving slow at the time.  The object was glowing so bright it was brighter than ur average full moon.   The object could have been goin in a circular motion but was to far for my eye to see the exact movement besides the horizontal line it was traveling in.  The object sped up fastly and disappeared off into the sky!   Very eerie experience.  Only lasted about 15-20 seconds, before it disappeared into thing.air.;39.2991;-80.2429
