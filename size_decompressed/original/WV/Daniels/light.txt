At approximately 18:20 hours on the evening of 12/31/2007 at approximately 235 degrees southwest I observed a moving object in the sky. It was twinkling like a star, but moved from left to right, then up and down and then in kind of half-loop executions. I compared it to a stable background of mountains and trees to try and make sure that it was not my eyes. The other stars did not move as it did. I called this reporting center at 18:40 hours and was told it was a planet that had commonly been mistaken for an UFO. To my reckoning planets do not twinkle. I then compared that to I think it is Mars (on over to the right/west of the object). Mars did not move, but the object still made the movements as it had before. I did not record this event with camera because the camera could not focus on it. My mother came by to see it as well and ... she got scared.;37.7232;-81.1128
