A brightly lighted, fast moving, triangular object.;2006-01-11 23:52:00;5 minutes;A brightly lighted, fast moving, triangular object. I am currently trying to build my own house on a remote piece of property that borders Wayne county. Due to it's remote location and the high number of heavy and/or expensive tools on the site I have been camping out on the house site. 11:52 PM on the 11th day of the 1st month of 2006 I went outside to see why my dog was whining and to smoke a cigarette. Then I noticed a bright shimmering light above the next ridge. I found this to be strange because I look at that ridge on a consistent basis and there has never been anything over there. As I watched it the light began growing slightly larger and pulsating, inbetween pulsations a red light would appear. I got another smoke and continued watching, after a couple minutes it started to rise straight upwards. Then it started to come towards me, all I could do was smoke and watch in astonishment as this thing came straight at me. The craft started to gain shape as it got closer, I could tell it was triangular in shape and it had one extremely bright white light on the front and a pulsating red light underneath. It gained speed as it got closer and passed a regular jet in a couple of seconds. As it passed overhead I could tell it was huge, dwarfing any regular jet in the sky. It passed by without making a sound and within a few more seconds it was gone. The hairs on my neck would not go down and I had to have several more smokes before I could calm down and go to bed. Then on this morning of the 12th I got on your website and see a drawn picture of exactly what I saw last night. Trust me when I say my hairs are on end again.;38.2677;-82.266
