Moving at high speeds and doing  90 degree turns. We were all just standing out by our campfire near the river in the local area when I saw something come over the horizon just as it was getting dark.  It made no sound was very low, but seemed small in size no bigger than a small mini coop or something around that size.  But the speed was at least 3x faster than any jet engine I have ever seen there was no vapor trail or anything just the orb of white it-self and the speed with no sound which was what caught my attention.  Because usually when a jet flies over you know it and it leaves a very loud sound but this thing nothing zooming around in ways I couldn't imagine.  An aircraft doing complete 90 degree turns yeah right no plane does that at full speed I am 100 percent positive this was a UFO and I also have 6 others who will admit the same.   I have no idea but I have experienced other encounters as well a lot closer scarier ones which I won't get into because this isn't the place for it and it has me concerned about my safety and that is why I am reporting it here.  Because I have now seen them near my home in the sky and its kind of scaring me. -- Thanks ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
