Monongahelia National Forest/Marlingto Road UFO Formation sighting.;1996-08-15 19:00:00;1-2 seconds;Monongahelia National Forest/Marlingto Road UFO Formation sighting. While on the return leg of a late evening bicycling trip on a WV state highway through Monongahelia National Forest, I glanced up into a clear blue, cloudless sky to see 5 objects traveling in formation out of the south-west. Shape:  Imagine a ball positioned in front in the direction of travel in super bright neon blue tapering to a point with a length equal to about 3 or 4 times the diameter of the leading ball. In addition, imagine this blue shape surrounded with a slightly larger identical shape in super bright neon green. Had I glanced up one second or two later, I would have missed the sighting due to the tree tops on each side of the road providing only a small section of sky view directly above the road. The objects made no noise and were similar in size, but not all the same traveling about 10 times faster than a jet at high altitude. The next week, a TV show called SIGHTINGS reported the same sighting out in the western part of the USA. The sighting date year could be 95 or 96. The time of year is correct. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));38.2217;-80.5451
