While investigating an outage, ( unrelated to UFO activity), I observed an orange light in the sky to the northwest of me. There was no flashing light on it, as all aircraft are supposed to use at night. I was in my truck,and got my 10X binoculars for a better look.The object had a dull, orange light on the bottom of the front, and 3 brightly lit windows toward me. The brightness of the lights made it impossible to see a sharp outline. Object was moving slower than a light plane would fly. It was very clear weather, with temperatures in the mid-teens. I left my truck's engine running, so I heard no sound. Object went behind a hill and I did not see it again. After I got home, I looked the area up on a large-scale map, and found that the object was at least 3 1/2 miles from me. I feel that it was at least as big as an airliner.;38.2227;-81.9975
