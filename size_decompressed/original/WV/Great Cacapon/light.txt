Bright disappearing lights in sky near Great Cacapon, WV 7/14/01;2001-07-14 21:00:00;10 minutes;Bright disappearing lights in sky near Great Cacapon, WV 7/14/01 My wife and I were sitting outside on the evening of 7/14/01 at around 9 pm near Great Cacapon, WV.  I was looking down into the Potomac River valley to the north towards Little Orleans, Maryland.  I noticed what I first believed to be a bright star or planet well above the horizon line.  It caught my attention, either because of its unusual brightness or a vague perception of movement.  While I was watching it, it suddenly disappeared.  My wife had not been watching, and I described to her what I had seen, and commented on its oddity.  A few minutes later, I observed the same light.  I pointed towards it, and said there!  My wife looked up and saw the light.  It remained for approximately 3-5 seconds, then again suddeny disappeared.  It was too large and bright to be an airplane, and the suddeness of its disappearance was its most remarkable feature.  It was also well-above the horizon and could not have been an object on the ground.;39.5826;-78.3311
