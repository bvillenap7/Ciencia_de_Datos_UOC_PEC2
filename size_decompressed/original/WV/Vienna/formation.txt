10 orange single round lights traveling from NE to SW to West;2012-07-21 22:30:00;30 minutes;10 orange single round lights traveling from NE to SW to West The sky was dark, sun had been down about 1.5 hours or so.  While driving I saw about 10 tiny orangish single round lights traveling from NE to SW to West, in the area of the Ohio River.   When I first saw them they seemed to be traveling in formation at a low altitude (lower or the same height as a small plane) then the formation dissipated and the lights scattered, traveling west.;39.3234;-81.543
