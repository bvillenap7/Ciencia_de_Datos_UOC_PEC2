Looking south at Venus in the night sky, noticed a bright sphere rapidly rising from the horizon, then quickly disappearing as it gets close in the sky to Venus.  It reappeared again about 25 min later in the west as a bright flash, and as soon as it lit up it vanished.  It appeared to be making a 90 degree when it lit up making almost like an ell shape trail.  The object was as bright as Venus in the night sky.
