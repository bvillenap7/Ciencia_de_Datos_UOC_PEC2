High Altitude Craft.;2012-09-01 14:00:00;2 minutes;High Altitude Craft Me and a friend was laying in the yard looking into the clouds, enjoying the last days of warm weather left that year, when I noticed something extremely far up,  but the clouds seemed very high altitude... the reason I say this is because I could see different sets of clouds at different levels,   The ship seemed silver,  I'm not exactly sure about the shape,  it kind of appeared and reappeared in and under the cloud line, in the same location before finally disappearing completely.   When I first seen the object, I told my friend and he immediately noticed what I was pointing to.  The thing that got me is how it was so far up,  and it was stationary other than when the clouds would block the object.  There was light/s,  I'm not for sure how many, or designâ€¦but it is possible it was reflections. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
