A slow and steadily moving brilliant ball of light with no tail beam;1992-08-01 17:00:00;15 seconds;A slow and steadily moving brilliant ball of light with no tail beam My experience with an Unidentified Flying Object.  I didn’t realize there was such a place to report my experience, so I am writing this now after sixteen years.  I have forgotten the exact date and time but will never forget the other details – the image and brilliance of this strange ball of light and the feeling that it was certainly not normal.  I was sitting on a couch chatting with my visiting father.  At the time I was 32 years old and my retired Naval officer father (I mention that because my father is not prone to frivolity) was about 54.  We have a 200 acre farm in rural West Virginia – very secluded and private.  The couch faced a wall of floor to ceiling windows overlooking a small mountain ridge and a pond.  All of a sudden an enormous ball of light appeared – there was no beam – the light was consistent for the entire size of the “ball.”  It looked like the sun but obviously a bit too close!  It was clearly moving but at a very slow and controlled speed.  It was not falling.  ” My father and I have related the experience to people every now and again and frequently people will ask it might have been a meteor.  We don’t think it was because of its slow controlled speed.  It passed out of sight after about 15 seconds.   I called the police – but felt they wouldn’t take us seriously.  I told the person who answered that I just felt like I should report it (I didn’t call it a UFO) in case they got other calls attesting to the same sighting.  Nothing ever came of it.  My father and I, after all these years, both say that we certainly saw something that defies our ability to understand. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
