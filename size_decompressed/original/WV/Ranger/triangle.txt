There were four of us ranging in ages of 7 to 12.  It was about 9:30pm.  We saw 3, totally silent triangular shaped craft either hovering or moving too slowly to have been any kind of conventional aircraft. One was very low in the sky.  It seemed to be lower than the tree tops.  It was probably at least 50 feet across.  One was illuminated by the moon and had a rounded or bull-nosed edge.  Metallic to dark silver-the color of hemotite.  the other 2 craft seemed higher up, not smaller, just fur- ther away. They moved from east to west very slowly. My brother shined a flashlight up at one, that's how low it was.  Each craft had bright white lights on each corner and a reddish orange one in the center, that appeared to be flashing.  The sighting lasted for approximately 15 minutes.  We were children at the time so we were not taken ser- iously by our parents and never revealed this to anyone else...until now.;38.097;-82.1633
