Me and my father were camping in Seneca Rocks, WV.  We had bought a constellation map at the nearby Greenbank Radio Telescope Center.  So, we were walking around the campground looking up at the sky trying to see these constellations.   After that, we went back to our camp, grabbed our toothbrushes and headed to the building that had the bathrooms and sinks.  As we were walking, something streaked across the sky.  It was chevron shaped, but was more rectangular and was longer.   My first thought was that it was a jet, but  it was flying far too low, and if it was we would have heard the engines, and it was dead silent.   My second thought was that it was a large bird, but that was quickly ruled out since it was huge, probably the size (length wise) of a plane.   We only noticed it because for a few seconds, it blocked out the stars with its shape (which was the only way I'm able to describe its shape since there were no lights on it).   I still have no idea what it was, and my dad, who is the most logical and down-to-earth person I've ever met, is still baffled and can't offer up an answer.
