Saucer craft landed near us.;1973-09-22 15:00:00;one hour;Saucer craft landed near us. On this lovely fall day 2 friends and I were searching for old bottles in a remote pasture where a homestead once stood.  We were there several hours.  Around three o'clock a HUGE silver saucer craft glided silently down from the sky and followed the contours of the hills landing on the other side of the hill from us, probably 1/2 to 1 mile away.  We could not see the craft from where we were standing.  At first we were scared and then about 20 minutes later, when nothing happened, we decided to live and let live and went on searching for bottles.  About an hour and half later we heard three electronic beeps from the other side of the hill.  It was then we decided to leave.  The next day a friend of ours told us he had seen the craft come down near our property from his place on the other side of town (about 10 miles away) and wondered if we had seen it.  As far as I know this siting was never reported. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));44.055;-101.6876
