LARGE flashing lights set on horizon.;2000-05-15 23:00:00;5 minutes;LARGE flashing lights set on horizon. I was standing out on the deck that stood 6 feet off the ground.  This was late night around eleven.   I was looking out at the horizon when I noticed 2 glowing orange/red balls in an area I would say they were approximately 8 miles from my location.  These were huge!   They were directly at my eye level.  They were visually measured to be about 6-8 inches apart from my visual location width apart.   They were glowing together at the same time and then one would go out then another and flash randomly.  I would say they were about the size of the cap of a 20 oz pop bottle lid sitting right in front of a person.  They both lit up bright and then just disappeared.   Shortly after, about 5-10 minutes later there was the sound of military jets flying in the area.;44.3966;-98.4749
