Quiet, swift moving craft.;2016-11-13 20:45:00;10 minutes;Quiet, swift moving craft Moving swiftly across southern sky moving west then an abrupt turn to north, moved directly overhead with 1 solid white light and blue to red at its points.  I believed it to be an orb until it was overhead.  The birds were loud upon its approach then silent when close and as it moved away.  Craft made very little noise when directly above me and made no noise coming or when moving away.  Just a whirring sound when above head,  Most likely a government secret ops craft but nonetheless weird and awesome.  No chance to grab camera and I don't know I have a good enough one to have captured it, sorry.  There was no visible exhaust or trail.;43.8981;-96.9759
