Darker than night rectangle with dim lights;2003-09-12 22:20:00;5-7 seconds;Darker than night rectangle with dim lights Standing in fairly dark backyard in town.  Moon was rising in the east causing the sky to be less than black.  Could see quite a few stars and just a faint hint of the milky-way glow.  Mars was nice and bright in the sky to the south-east.  My girlfriend and I had just seen a group of geese flying off to the west, lit up by the city lights.  There were two normal aircraft in the sky, with easily recognizable marker lights.  I was looking to the north at about a forty-five degree angle when I say what I thought at first was another group of geese.  I quickly figured that this was not the case by the speed of the lights.  I immediately started to track the lights by pointing with my finger so my girlfriend could see them also.  Within a few seconds the 'lights' were straight over head.  At this point I could make out a 'darker than night sky' shape of what seemed to be a rectangle.  The rectangle had a dim / non-distinct light at each corner and one in the center.  A few moments later the lights had travel far enough south as to go behind a tree in my yard.  The object was approximately the size of a two finger tips at arms length.  No noise was heard (it was very still, 50 degrees, clear night).  Object was moving very quickly, esp. in comparision to other aircraft visible in the sky.  Object was traveling fast enough so that my girlfriend was not able to track and see it.  Was very discerning.  I have seen other UFO type items before, and this was one of the more blatant and strikingly obvious ones I have seen thus far.  Gave me some pretty good chills up and down my spine, and I am not easily shaken.;42.7926;-96.9218
