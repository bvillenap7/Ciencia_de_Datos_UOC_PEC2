I simply don't know what they were.;2005-08-27 20:15:00;4  min.;I simply don't know what they were. I don't know what they were. At around 8:15pm, my friend and I were parked in the Burger King parking lot, visiting and watching the cars go by. Something in the sky caught our attention.  At first, I thought it was three birds flying close together, but then noticed that there was no flapping of wings. They looked like three black triangle shapes that were flying close to one another. They made no sound. The three objects came from the north, flying south, and then went toward the south-west. I estimate their speed at around 30-40 mph, judging by the speed of the cars below. About a minute after the three objects were off in the distance and no longer visible, a fourth object was observed. This fourth object took the same flight path as the first three, and traveled at the same speed, only this object was shaped differently. This was like a black dot in the sky. There were no lights nor any sound to this object. I took a snapshot of this one, and am courious to see how it shows up on film. Again, this flying black dot went into a south-westerly direction.  I drove my car in that direction hoping to catch another glimps of it, but could not catch up to it.;43.7081;-98.0300000000001
