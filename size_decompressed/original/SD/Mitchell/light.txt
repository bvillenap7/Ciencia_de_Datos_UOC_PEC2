Dark object with lights around- went west and turned 90 degrees and shot north.;2010-10-14 19:20:00;2 min;Dark object with lights around- went west and turned 90 degrees and shot north. I was standing on my back deck, saw light way up high in sky with additional lights around- flew west and then made 90 degree turn and shooted north.  Disappeared.   There were no clouds in the sky to fly into- the sun was setting too so it was a little light out- but could see a dark object with the lights around it.  And it was quiet.  No engine sounds like a plane.;43.7081;-98.0300000000001
Gold light in the sky that separates;2011-12-15 18:05:00;45 seconds;Gold light in the sky that separates I was standing on my backyard deck facing south.  I noticed a golden light in the sky that divided into 2 lights.  Then one disappeared and the one that was left divided into two again.  It almost made like a 'w' shape when it separated. I was thinking, could it be a flare or firework, but it sure didn't look like any of those.  Also, I don't see much movement from it other then it separating.  Within about 30 or 40 seconds, it all disappeared.  It was not a star. It was a bright golden hue.   My town has a population of about 15000 or so, and there's no airplanes close to us either.;43.7081;-98.0300000000001
