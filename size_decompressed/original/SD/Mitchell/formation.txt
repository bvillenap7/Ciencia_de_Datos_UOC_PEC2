Four lights moving east then suddenly west.;2013-12-18 18:00:00;8 minutes;four lights moving east then suddenly west Was letting dogs outside and saw four lights to the south of town.  They all moved in formation to the east, almost in the shape of a rectangle.  My husband saw this too. Shortly after moving a ways, they switched direction quickly and headed west.  Each light flickered right after the other, they were spaced apart too, quite a bit.  They moved together to the west until I couldn't see them anymore.  Never seen this before in my life.  The way they flipped direction is unreal to me.;43.7081;-98.0300000000001

On the Evening of May 24th, 2019, there was a straight line formation of over 30 bright white orbs flying south.  This lasted less than five minutes as it flew directly south, all in formation, spacing from nearly right over each other as well as trailing hundreds of miles back in the far sky.;43.7081;-98.0300000000001
