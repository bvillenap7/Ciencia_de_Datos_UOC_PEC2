2 to 3 minute sighting of bright oval shaped object.moving south.;2009-06-22 21:16:00;3 minutes;2 to 3 minute sighting of bright oval shaped object.moving south. I was in my backyard talking to my sister, when she told my to look up.  It took me about a minute before I saw it.  it looked to be at roughly 7000 feet.  It looked to be a flattened oval about 3/4 of an inch long.  It was moving south at a constant speed.  It was a bright white color and appeared to have a highly reflective surface.  There was no indication of wings, contrails, engine sounds or strobe lights visible on it.  it went into a cloud bank and was still visible for a few seconds before it was gone from sight. i have had weather spotter training and a fair knowledge of aircraft.;43.9893;-96.6476
