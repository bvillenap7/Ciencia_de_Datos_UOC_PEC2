Appears to the naked eye to be a bright white light but at times you can see red and yellow in it also.  Looks about the size of a grapefruit and is at about a 45 degree angle above the horizon.  My husband came home and said that there were 3 helicopters in the area which is unusual. About all we ever see for those are medical ones.   He started telling me about this big bright light out in the west/southwest.  I went out and looked and came in and got the video camera.  Looking at the screen on max zoom (75x i.zoom) Panasonic HC-V130 camera)  When I first located it, it was more like a bright white light but, as I zoomed in, it took on the shape of a diamond.  The diamond looked to be a white or but, milky, not bright white.  Other times, in the video it looks different shapes and a darker color like a charcoal gray. The night is clear, stars and moon visible.  There are some towers about 6 miles west of here but, they have strobing lights and I am very familiar with them.  I do not know what this is but, it is not a plane, helicopter or any other type of aircraft I am familiar with.   I took several videos and a couple still pics.  I just went to the back door to look out, it was 20:31 and it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius??  PD));43.9893;-96.6476
