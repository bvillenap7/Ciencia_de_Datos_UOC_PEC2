There were nearly 20 of us present including several children under the age of 10.  At 22:15 one of us noticed an orange light in the sky almost directly to the east of us maybe a few miles away.  The light was moving above the tree line but quite a bit lower than an airplane.  There was absolutely no sound at all with the light.  It moved slowly towards us then veered slightly to the south and disappeared.;45.4501;-99.0155
Bright, unexplained light;2010-07-04 22:30:00;1:30 min.;Bright, unexplained light In Ipswich, SD, on the evening of July 4th at approximately 10:30 P.M., myself and about 15 others were setting off fireworks when we witnessed a strange bright orange/red type light in the eastern sky.   It moved slowly from the east towards the west and then veered to the southwest.   The light seemed to be over the town.   We witnessed the light for about 1 Â½ min.  The light appeared to be about 2500 feet above the ground and then seemed higher in the sky as it moved towards the southwest.   We could not hear any sound coming from the light.  In Ipswich, it would be very unusual for light aircraft to fly this late at night and this low, and we would have heard the engine.  We also felt it was not a balloon as it traveled faster than the speed of the wind that night.  We had no explanation.
