The light was gone within 2 seconds 5 - 10 seconds later the light appeared over M-hill in Rapid City.  It was not the sun this craft had a definite shape that was not a plane. The object looked more like a half frisbee. It disappeared into the clouds and then reappeared in a different location.  It did not have blinking lights like a plane would have had.  The light was not from the sun, I do not know what I saw yet I know that I saw what I did.  The second time it appeared it disappeared just as quickly back into the clouds.  Talk about strange. I guess I can now say that I am one of those crazy people who has seen a UFO.  I would like it explained to me, if there is a good explenation.;44.0760575;-103.246480416667
Gliding white soundless aircraft, shaped like a thin semi-circle;2011-08-13 03:30:00;15 seconds;Gliding white soundless aircraft, shaped like a thin semi-circle Saw gliding light, white soundless aircraft gliding in sky.  Shaped like a thin semi-circle. Moved fast and was very large. Second one was about 20 minutes later just higher up, flying on the exact same path.  No lights, just looked like it was reflecting light from the full moon.  It was the night of the Perseids Meteor showering which is why we were looking up.  Second odd object we have seen on the Perseids Meteor shower night.  It was odd this time because it was so quiet that night yet we could hear nothing from the aircraft.

Boomrang object with neon colored lights.;2012-12-15 00:00:00;5 minutes;Boomrang object with neon colored lights. The first time I seen this boomrang shaped objuect was in 2012 around December time.   I was sitting out side with my husband.  I looked up and seen a boomrang shaped object, on the front of it was lights that were colored green.  One the back part it it was lit up with light green colors.  But they were in a line so I could tell what the shape was. This object was moving slow.   I have also seen it again in 2013.  Around the same time and time of year.  Me and my husband were sitting outside but this time with our 2 female narbor's whom also seen it as well.   These sightings were only once a night.   I encourage other people to look as well.  I would love to know if this is UFO or military experements that they arent telling us about!  It was low to the ground about 50 feet above me. It was NOT a bight light, but very stelthy.;44.0760575;-103.246480416667
