Single, bright white light over Rapid City, SD.;2009-05-17 23:30:00;5 seconds;Single, bright white light over Rapid City, SD. I live about 10 miles from an Air Force Base that has B-1B bombers.  These planes are very loud and unmistakable.  I also live about 5 miles from a regional airport.  I have prior military experience with aircraft so I have more than general knowledge regarding general aviation. On the night of May 17, 2009 around 11:30 pm I stepped outside to smoke.  It was a clear night and the stars were visible.  I noticed a single bright, round, white light at about 35,000 feet (or more) in the sky to the north and thought it was a plan.  I looked up and it just continued to get brighter and quickly disappeared.  There was no noise and the color and shape stayed the same.  It almost seemed like the light was coming closer and just turned around and went up and was gone.  It took about 4-5 seconds. I have never seen anything like this in my life.  It wasnâ€™t a plane, satellite, or shooting star.  I wonder if it was a dying star or even a UFO.;44.0760575;-103.246480416667

Bright top shaped light spinning very rapidly flashing green, blue and red.;2013-09-21 21:30:00;30-40 minutes;Bright top shaped light spinning very rapidly flashing green, blue and red. Around 9:20 pm on September 21, 2013 i was sitting out back of my sister's apartment and noticed a blinking light in the sky towards the west of Rapid City, SD.  My sister had binoculars and I looked through the binoculars and the light appeared to be spinning very very fast.  It was so fast it was leaving a trail of the colors green, red and blue.  It appeared to be top shaped and stayed in the same spot.  We continued to watch it for about 30-40 minutes until it started drifting further to the west.

Pulsing noise, purposely did not look for craft.  Three seperate nights.  Gets louder and faster as gets closer.;2014-12-17 02:30:00;1 hour;Pulsing noise, purposely did not look for craft.  Three seperate nights.  Gets louder and faster as gets closer. Noise.  Pulsing noise 'wom.....wom...' etc.  Started outside, sounded as if above house, coming from specific direction.  Never heard similar.  Pauses betwen pulses exponetially decreased, as duration of pulses slowly increased, as did volume of noise as time went.   Sounded as if moving, changing direction slightly but on general course of down, toward window.  Right outside window: did not look.  Loud, 'wom.wom.wom.wom'.   Left room.  Then began hearing high-pitched, but very quiet Hertz-frequency-noises inside the room, exactly on one, and then the other side of bed alternating.  Did not see anything.  Occasionally heard slightly higher-pitched 'wom' pulsing noise outside of room.  Not cool.   Happened on Dec 19th, Dec 21st as well.  Today is Dec 22nd. Do not like these visits.  Never experienced anything like this, always been a skeptic. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.0760575;-103.246480416667
Sounds in the middle of the night.;2016-02-16 00:15:00;>1 hour;Sounds in the middle of the night. Strange humming sounds during the night.  It goes on and off like a car trying to start.  Then it turns off.  Like it powers down.  Like a *whewwww* then its silent.  I have no idea what it is.  It's not like a trumpet, its more like a humming sound.
