I have never seen anything like this before. It kind of scared me.;2001-10-15 19:35:00;30 seconds;I have never seen anything like this before. It kind of scared me. I was looking up into the sky looking for the space station that was was to pass over. I then seen somthing that at firt looked like a gagle of geese flying in a V. I then saw a streamer like thing, and thought that it looks like a tail of a shooting star. It then hit me that I was not looking at anything I have ever seen before. It looked like a arrow flying through the air about 150 to 200 yards in the air, and thare was now sound from the thing at all. I dont know what I saw but if somone may know I would sur like to know.;44.0760575;-103.246480416667
It hovered until we stopped like it was waiting for someone to see it.;2004-03-15 18:00:00;8min;It hovered until we stopped like it was waiting for someone to see it. We were headed east out of rapid city at exit 59 onto I90.  I was driving and noticed a set of landing lights pointed west like they were landing at Ellworth airforce base.   After a mile or two I realised they were'nt moving and said so to my companions.  We continued east all the while watching the lights.  When we got to the last airbase exit I stopped the car at the side of the off ramp.  We all three got out and looked up directly above us at this large black triangle.  It was just hovering above us at about 200 feet.  My guess was about 60 feet from corner to corner.  It continued hovering there for about 20 sec. and then 1 corner went down, another went up, and it turned and floated south towards Rapid City Regional Airport where it disappeared. The weird things:  It was right along side the flight path of military planes landing which is s.e. to n.w.. It was just after sunset the sky was somewhat dark but it was still plainly visible against the light sky.  We were the only people who stopped and I got the feeling they were waiting to see if anyone would stop and look.  When it turned we were directly below and I heard barely audible very muffled jet engines.  When it flew towards the civilian airport it disapppeared.  At first we thought it had to have flown over the airport but after thinking about it we knew that wasn't likely as there was a plane landing at that time.  The civilian airport is up on a hill which gave me reference height and we believe it flew over towards there and disappeared in front of the hill.  How we don't know.  It had landing lights on it just like the military and civilian planes all do.  No other lights were displayed.  Distance from exit 59 to the last exit is approximately 7 miles.  It was facing straight west while the landing path is to the n.w..  I think it was a military plane as the airforce base radar surely would pick it up.

Saw tri-angle lights under dark body while driving west on I-90.;2004-11-15 20:30:00;10 Min;Saw tri-angle lights under dark body while driving west on I-90 Driving West on I- 90 a friend of mine an I saw what appeared to be a very bright star decending tward the ground from about 10 or 15,000 feet to about 1500 feet above ground level as we drove tward it at about 90 MPH. By the time we were about a mile from the object we assumed it to be some sort of aircraft from Ellsworth AFB. We quickly changed our minds when the odject appeard to be Three lights aranged in a tri-angle, The lights looked like a very large street light except that there was a dark body behind the lights and it appeared to be hovering at about 1500 to 2000 feet, which Helocopter pilots dont like to do becouse they loose ground effect.  So we drive untill we are undernieth the object at which point were really freaked out we roll the windows down to confirm that its not a helo/ Harrier/ JSF X-plane Ect. and no sound was heard besides road noise, my friend sits on the door and looks over the top of the truck at the object and i Look out my open window to confirm that its not a reflection or any thing else. At this point we are driving about 60 mph next to a commercial truck whose driver looks at me with this wild expression as we both look back at the object it moves slowly tward the north and then just kind of winks out of view. To this day it is the only thing like it that i have ever seen, wether it was something from Ellsworth or not I dont know, I just thought that I should let somebody know.

the object was hanging in the air above us for about 15-20 secodns and flew away very slowly...;2005-04-20 21:00:00;1-2 min;the object was hanging in the air above us for about 15-20 secodns and flew away very slowly... We saw it while we were driving on highway. It was up in air above us, in front. It was floating in the air. We thought it was hellicopter. We approached until the object was above us and we parked our car aside on the highway. We got out and started to look at it. We didnt see it clearly because it was dark after sunset, but we could see that it was darker against the sky and was triangle shape (around 9pm) had larger yellow light in center and smal light on point and red and blue light on the end corners of the triangle. We didnt hear hellicopter sound and didnt know what was that. We assumed it was not a hellicopter. It floated there for about 15 or 20 seconds and moved away towards where we were coming from. And in its behind we could see bright light in center (on tail side) and red and blue slowly glowing on each corner of its tail side. We watched it until it was gone too far that we could see it anymore with our naked eye. We dont know what was that. Itdidnt look like a plane or hellicopter. It didnt have a jet or some kind of sound. What do you think it is? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  PD));44.0760575;-103.246480416667
Triangular Dark Silent Craft Over Downtown Rapid City, South Dakota;2006-10-30 23:00:00;10 seconds;Triangular Dark Silent Craft Over Downtown Rapid City, South Dakota Craft was completely silent and with no lights.  Sky was clear with many stars.  The craft was traveling north/south and was a triangular shape, somewhat like the stealth bomber.  I only noticed the craft because it was blocking out the stars behind and the craft seemed to reflect the glow of the city below it.  The flight was straight despite the high winds.  It never veered or moved from its path.;44.0760575;-103.246480416667

Loud humming triangular craft observed over Western South Dakota moving at high speed;2009-05-25 22:00:00;30 seconds;Loud humming triangular craft observed over Western South Dakota moving at high speed On 25 May 2009 at approximately 2200 hours, a triangular shaped craft was detected moving West to East over various locations in western South Dakota between Highway 44 and Rapid City Regional Airport. One letter written in to the Rapid City Journal described the object as 'making a loud humming noise before accelerating at an immense speed and disappearing out of sight.'  Despite an Air Show at Ellsworth AFB during the following weekend, only home-station aircraft, the B-1 Bomber were at the base and none were in flight during this time.  The craft was spotted by several eye-witnesses, some of whom detected the same craft at approximately 0430 on Tuesday the 26th of May, 2009.;44.0760575;-103.246480416667
