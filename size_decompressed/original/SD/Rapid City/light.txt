Looked for and found a satellite, as well as a UFO;2000-09-27 20:35:00;1 minute;Looked for and found a satellite, as well as a UFO On the evening of 27 September, I was in my back yard looking up in the sky.  I was trying to prove to a friend that what he had witnessed the previous evening was a satellite and nothing more, so I watched the same area of sky he had (due north) and waited.  Sure enough, a dimly lit object came from the south and halfway across the sky gained in brightness, reached a peak of brightness, and slowly dimmed and moved on.  I attributed the change in illumination to reflection of sunlight off a solar panel of a man-made object, but my story does not end here. Crossing the path of the above object and just barely visible to the naked eye was a dimmer object which seemed to have a reddish-brown aura surrounding it.  I thought it was a shooting star at first, but the object did not throw sparks and was travelling too slowly for a meteorite, but faster than any object that I have seen in orbit.  It moved from west to southeast, and performed manuvers (no meteor could have done this) in a zig-zag fashion.  I watched the object for a full minute until it faded from sight.;44.0760575;-103.246480416667
many light objects flying around in an area;2001-08-30 21:00:00;45 min;many light objects flying around in an area looking to the soutwest, i saw something that i thought was maybe fireworks then noticed that it was light objects flying around an area about 30 degrees above the horizon they would sometimes appear to chase each other  but mostly in a random pattern they would fly at a high rate of speed and then change direction at the same rate without hesitation---after about 45 min a slow plane or helicopter came from the north over the area--it had two bright large red lights on each end of it and a strobe in the middle--after that, we saw the objects no more.  the plane flew off to the south and southeast toward ellsworth air force base---we lost track of it becase of trees.     thanks;44.0760575;-103.246480416667
spooky light that shines at you but tries to act like a star in a constellation afterwards.;2002-07-12 01:20:00;2 minutes;spooky light that shines at you but tries to act like a star in a constellation afterwards. me and my younger sister stepped outside one night and i was showing her constellations as well as i knew them and all of a sudden in the big dipper a light that ithought was a star grew more intense and shifted a baseballs width held at arms length to my left (i was facing west). then the light looked similar to someone with a flashlight moving the flashlight in erratic patterns for a few seconds. then the light that moved dimmed again and stayed there for the remainder of the night. we were scared after this incident so we ran inside but we stayed to witness enough to know that it was not normal. after we gained enough courage to go back out again it felt to us as though we were being watched by the light. but we are okay now. thanx. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the objects may have been celestial bodies, but we have no explanation for why they would move as much as the witness reports.  PD));44.0760575;-103.246480416667
A single point of light, similar to a satellite, was seen moving erratically across the night sky over the Black Hills of SD.;2002-07-28 22:00:00;appr 5 min;A single point of light, similar to a satellite, was seen moving erratically across the night sky over the Black Hills of SD. I was enjoying a late evening soak in the hot tub on my deck outdoors with 4 friends. We recalled that it was getting close to time for the Perseids. We saw a few meteors, and continued to look for others. The observers were an adult couple, their teenaged daughter, and two adult females, ranging in age from 14 - 53. All adults are college educated, but not scientists. No alcohol or any other potentially conscious-altering substances had been consumed by any of us, the entire day. We pointed out to each other several moving points of light, at different times, that appeared to be satellites (we see quite a few of those out here). Then one of us spotted what he thought was another satellite. We all looked, and at first it appeared similar to the previous satellites we had seen, ie. a small point of light moving at a constant rate of speed, similar to that of a satellite. But then it began to move erratically instead of following a smooth, straight orb. It zigzaged and curved back on its path, and seemed to slow down and speed up, following the type of non-pattern you might walk if you were looking for something you had dropped in the grass, if you weren't sure where you had dropped it exactly. We discussed it, trying to think of anything that might produce such movement. After meandering about in this fashion for several minutes, the point of light just winked out. Not a gradual trailing off into the distance, but *poof* it was gone, completely. We all saw it... and none of us have never seen anything like it. I would guess the time to have been sometime between 9:45 - 10:15 pm, on July 28, 2002. I would estimate that the temperature was in the mid-to-upper 60s and it was a clear night, with little or no wind, at about 4,000' altitude, outside of Rapid City in a rural area near Spring Canyon, in the Black Hills.

landing of unidentified object;2005-02-25 05:47:00;3.0 seconds;landing of unidentified object I am a retired Air Force TSgt and hold 2 Bachelor of Science Degrees.   I have witnessed plenty of unidentified things but this beats me.  My sons (ages 18 and 14) and I were delivering morning papers.  One was in the car with me, one was outside.  I checked my watch immediately after the event.  As we were looking north over the city from our position we observed an object (that we believed was a meteor due to it's speed and blue-white color - but no tail) come over the car from the south-southeast toward the north-northwest.   As this object approached the horizon and we expected it to burnout, it suddenly stopped, hung motionless for a fraction of a second, and dropped straight to the ground in a controlled fashion, still lit blue-white.  It slowed as it descended, like an elevator. Wierdest thing I ever saw.  I estimate the range of the object to have been between 7 to 10 miles away.  It scared the heck out of both kids not to mention me.;44.0760575;-103.246480416667
Seemingly shooting star spilt into 4 objects, then joins back up into one object in the Black Hills.;2009-03-19 12:22:00;20 seconds;Seemingly shooting star spilt into 4 objects, then joins back up into one object in the Black Hills. I was parked in my driveway getting out of the car when I thought I saw a shooting star in the Western part of the sky, over the Black Hills, moving North East.  I exclaimed to my husband - look! A shooting star!  Make a wish!   But what I thought was a star wasn't.  It didn't fade out, it seemed very close to Earth too close to be anything but an airplane), it made no noise at all, and the shooting star-like thing split, uniformly, into 4 parts.  The 4 parts looked like shooting stars, same size as the original and they moved slightly away from each other.   After moving away from each other for 5 seconds, still going North East very quickly, they joined back up in a uniform fashion.  They didn't lose or gain speed, they just moved very fast at a steady pace.  By this time, I was squealing at my husband to get out of the car to see this, but the shooting star moved to a spot in the sky behind some trees in the yard, and I did not see it again.  I looked all around for anything that might have reflected light, like tree branches or power lines, but I found none.  This occurred in the middle of the night on a very quiet residential street, and no one else was around.  There were no trains, cars, airplanes or clouds around at all. I hope I gave you enough info!  This was a very exciting experience!;44.0760575;-103.246480416667

I looked to the east and seen a bright white light. I thought it was a helicopter but heard nothing. I let my friends know so they can look also. as we looked the light grew larger then made a sharp turn to the north. the light then began to fade out then disapeared all together.;44.0760575;-103.246480416667

It went across the sky in approx. three seconds.    I am positive it was not a satellite or airplane as it moved much too fast.  There was no flashing lights or nothing else.;44.0760575;-103.246480416667
Stationary lights hanging, dropping, then bouncing, then dropping and going out.;2014-06-29 03:55:00;15 minutes;Stationary lights hanging, dropping, then bouncing, then dropping and going out. A series of 3 lights. Red and yellow/orange hanging out in the sky stationary for 5 minutes.  Then the lights dropped down and hung out again for a few minutes.  They started slowly bouncing up and down kind of like a spider on a web.  They dropped again and the lights faded and went out.;44.0760575;-103.246480416667
Two yellow/orange flame-like lights hovering in a non-linear pattern and then dimming and traveling upward.;2014-08-16 21:00:00;10 minutes;Two yellow/orange flame-like lights hovering in a non-linear pattern and then dimming and traveling upward. Initially one light was seen in night sky over west edge of Rapid City, from a location near south shore Canyon Lake.   Roughly 2 minutes later a similar second light was noticed traveling upward across the horizon. Both lights hovered in sky and appeared to raise and lower vertically.  They were hovering slowly.  They were bright and appeared almost like a flame.  They were yellow/orange in color and flickering between very bright and dimming.  Approximately 10 minutes after noticing the first light, both of them traveled upward at an angle and dimmed.   When the flares were dimmed they could still be noticed moving in a non-linear pattern across the horizon, but less pronounced.;44.0760575;-103.246480416667

I chose a pair of bright stars in the northern sky to help keep track of the area where I was seeing the most shooting stars.   After coming out to check the sky's again for the 3rd or 4th time, I located the pair of marker stars  I'd been using to keep track of the skies.  That's when one of the two stars began moving quickly to the west, then suddenly shooting upwards and disappearing in less than a second.;44.0760575;-103.246480416667
