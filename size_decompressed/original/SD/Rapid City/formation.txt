Not a UFO per se, but one giant ball of light breaking up over a 20 second period of time traveling in one direction.;2014-09-02 23:00:00;20 seconds;Not a UFO per se, but one giant ball of light breaking up over a 20 second period of time traveling in one direction until it was between 25-40 streaks of light, still traveling in a column formation due north.  It was a large meteorite type object that broke apart over Rapid City, SD, and disintegrated ...  No plain or simple shooting star or fire ballon or seasonal meteor shower.  This was an impact on the atmosphere that blew me away, and my girlfriend too!  Like a Hollywood movie of a UFO breaking up in space crashing into earth!  It was THAT cool! ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the event might have been caused by re-entering space debris.  If the estimate of the duration of the event is accurate, the object probably was not a meteor;44.0760575;-103.246480416667
Between 17 and 20 orange orbs drifted toward the Black Hills.  ((anonymous report));2018-12-01 21:20:00;20 minutes;Between 17 and 20 orange orbs drifted toward the Black Hills. Originally, I counted seventeen orange orbs that appeared to drift up from the southeast. From where I stood, it looked like these things climbed up into the night sky, way off to the south, towards Custer State Park.  I watched as they drifted toward Keystone, and then angled somewhat toward the northwest, toward the Black Hills.  Only, the second time I counted, there were twenty of them.  The skies were overcast, but it wasnâ€™t snowing like it had been earlier.  The wind was calm, and the temperature hovered around 30 degrees Fahrenheit.
