Silver cigar shape craft over north rapid;2007-10-04 23:35:00;15 seconds;Silver cigar shape craft over north rapid It looked like a silver cigar shaped craft. I was letting the dog out in the back yard and looked up to see this thing going south east. It made a humming sound. No lights but i managed to make out the shape due to the city lights. Never seen anything like it. I am not crazy! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));44.0760575;-103.246480416667
