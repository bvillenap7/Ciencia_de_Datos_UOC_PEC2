Meteorite-like object tracking across the entire sky from east to west moving at a tremendous speed.;2004-01-14 05:40:00;<10 seconds;Meteorite-like object tracking across the entire sky from east to west moving at a tremendous speed. While out walking prior to daybreak, I saw this bright light in the eastern sky.  It had the appearance of a meteorite with a contrail behind it that glowed.  It was traveling from east to west and was continuously visible as it traveled completely  across the sky.  It was moving at a tremendous speed and there was no sound.  I could see the blinking lights of a large aircraft in the northern sky at the same time and this object was moving so fast it made the aircraft appear to almost be standing still.  The aircraft appeared to be flying above 30,000 feet and was so far off in the distance that I could not hear the sound of its' engines.  This object appeared to be at a lower altitude.;43.0692;-98.5255
