White light ball moving south to north, then up.;2016-09-29 21:00:00;20-30 seconds;White light ball moving south to north, then up Put kids to bed around 9, then went outside to smoke a cigarette.  I was on my phone when I saw a bright white light moving across the sky.  I initially thought it might've been a low flying aircraft, but no blinking lights.  I couldn't see a shape, just a singular bright white light.  I thought, well maybe it's a heliocopter with a spotlight, but I've seen that before, & this was different.  Also no sounds that you'd hear from a low flying craft. The light initially traveled from south to north, then made an abrupt 90 degree turn that initially looked like it was going east.  The light then faded to look similar to a bright star or planet.  It continued to fade and look like a dim star.  Then it was no longer visible.  What I initially thought it was moving east, seems more like it was moving out farther into space. I'm an Air Force veteran and I've never seen any kind of aircraft move like this ball of light. There weren't any sort of tail fire you'd seen in a jet either.;42.5281;-96.5069
