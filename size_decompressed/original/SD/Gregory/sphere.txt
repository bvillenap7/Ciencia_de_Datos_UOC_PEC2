I looked out the window and thought that he was talking about rocks in the pasture but he kept asking as we drove another mile down the road.  I finally stopped the pickup to see what he was talking about.   That is when my 13 year old saw the sphere about 1/3 the size of a full moon slowly drifting to the south at about a 35 degree angle above the horizon.  It seemed to stop and hover for about 5 minutes as we stopped.  I could strangly only see it with use of binoculars even though my eyesight is excellent. It was a white color but also looked translucent as you could see a hint of blue sky through it.  My 12 year old son never did see it, but all of the rest of us did.  I first thought it to be a weather ballon but it was traveling into the wind (south).  There was no sound.  All at once it made a 90 degree angle straight up, then a right 90 degree angle, then a 90 degree angle striaght down, then it rapidly disappeared to the south at a high rate of speed.   There were no airplanes in the area.  The sky was mostly sunny with a 20 mph south wind blowing.;43.2102;-99.364
