This was about, 1:15 AM when My Sister and I were sitting out in the front yard looking at the Milky Way, when a group of 9 or so lights came from the North and started coming toward us. They were in 2 rows at first, then as they got above us, they slowed and separated into a V shape.  I told my Sister to run in the house after it started to make this low Humming noise, (Kind of like, a Choir) I didn't know what to do, so I ran back inside after I watched it continue to fly South.  I do believe it was some sort of UFO, because it was definitely not a Group of Airplanes. I've only seen this one other time during that Summer, but I don't know what else it could be...;43.2328;-100.8535
