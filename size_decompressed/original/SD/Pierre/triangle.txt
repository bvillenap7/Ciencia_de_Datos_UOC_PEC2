Blinding bright triangle.  ((anonymous report));2017-08-05 23:00:00;2 minutes;Blinding bright triangle. We observed a very bright light moving west to east directly above us, more towards the eastern sky.  Moving quickly.  Very far away...but could barely look at it.  It was so bright we couldn't really focus on it.  Like a large star with a long tail.   After sometime, it faded and disappeared.   It hurt our eyes, yet it was very far away.
