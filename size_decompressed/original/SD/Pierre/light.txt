Monday at 9:00pm I witnessed a U.F.O that resembled a star.  It was bright and shiny, shaped like an elongated football height from the ground was 200 feet.   It must of thought I wasn’t watching until I started chasing towards the U.F.O.  Then it started moving towards the east, going fast and it stopped abruptly, one bright fluorescent light shined bright, then two green lights came on which must have been it back.   The object made a shuttering noise, before leaven my sight towards a 45 degree departure to space.   I was scared because it recognized I was watching it, and reacted by slowing down and left my sight of vision. I hope the people of the world, start looking up every night.   Thank you for reading my U.F.O. experience. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness and found him to be sincere and serious-minded.  We have changed the data above, to reflect a sighting on Monday, January 28, 2013.  PD));44.3694999999999;-100.3211
Bright light with no sound moves west to east.;2014-08-02 23:00:00;5 minutes;Bright light with no sound moves west to east. While sky watching Saturday, August 2nd, 2014, looking to the south my friend and I saw a bright light that was about the size and brightness of the ISS except this object was moving in a straight line from West to East. It appeared to be quite lower than any satellite but there was no sound made by this craft.  There was no wind on that night so I was really surprised at how quiet it was.  I have never seen a light that bright move in that direction. At one point when it was about ¾ way across the it got about 10 times brighter than it was originally and then faded out and disappeared.;44.3694999999999;-100.3211
