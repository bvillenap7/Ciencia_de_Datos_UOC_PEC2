Red and green lights moving with no sound over Pierre, in central South Dakota, seen in 1998 now finally reported.;1998-08-01 23:00:00;10 seconds;Red and green lights moving with no sound over Pierre, in central South Dakota, seen in 1998 now finally reported. My family and I had been out at night looking at the stars. A thunderstorm was moving in around the time we headed back to town. Our kids had gone into the motel and as my wife and I were heading in, I looked up toward my left and then pointed it our to her.  She saw it, too. There was no sound. It moved fairly slowly. The sky, as I recall, was overcast somewhat. This could have made the lights look somewhat hazy, sort of like seeing a colored light through a mist or fog. There was a row of lights appearing this way. As I recall they were red and green and not flashing. Each light, based on what may have been the distance in view of the objects speed and height as best as I would guess the depth of field, would be around one to three feet in diameter.  Again, the haze of the evening may have made the lights look larger than they were. But again, no sound was heard. In view of its unusual drifting movement, it is hard to think of a plane. And it was low and not close to the airport. The hazy lights were pretty much in a straight line, but from what I recall in a slightly elongated V form. Within seconds it moved out of sight. It would be natural to write this off, but it has been close to ten years and you are the first official place to receive my report. I do not know what it was. It did not fit the usual context of normal flying vehicles. So all I can say is it was unidentified. Thank you for reading.
