Bright oval light moving west to east near the North Star;2001-08-01 23:15:00;2-3 minutes;Bright oval light moving west to east near the North Star I noticed a brighter than normal light near the last star in the handle of the Big Dipper. It was moving South to North. It was moving faster than a satellite does. It grew dimmer as it moved and disappeared after 3-4 seconds. There was no sound. About 10 minutes later I noticed the same kind of light moving at about the same speed near the North star. It grew slightly brighter as it moved east. It appeared to slow as it continued to move east/southeast. It eventually stopped movement but it also grew dimmer until I could no longer see it. There was no noise. Estimated time lapse was 2-3 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the descriptions of the objects are somewhat reminiscent of orbitting objects.  They do naturally dim and disappear from sight as they pass into the Earth's shadow.  PD));44.3475;-97.8587
