My dad, cousin, and I were on our way into Mission to pick my mother up from her night class when we saw this orange light in the sky that faded from our right and turned up on our left. It did that twice in a row, and then the third time it got very bright then faded to this red color then broke off into three little circles.  Then a couple minutes later it disappeared from the left side of the sky then turned up on the right. It did that for about 10 - 15 minutes.  As we got closer to Mission the lights faded then disappeared.  After that we did not see them again.  It was the next day that we found out that another person who lives close to the town saw the same thing we saw. She went online and reported it. But I’m not sure what sight she went to, to report it.  It was just an amazing sight at what we all seen. I am still in shock that I saw that even though it happened a month and a half ago.  It was amazing. I believe that they were UFO’s in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate no time indicated by the witness.  We have assigned an artificial time above.
