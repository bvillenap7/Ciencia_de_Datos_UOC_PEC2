bright orange lights over Chamberlain, SD;2011-03-16 21:16:00;5 minutes;bright orange lights over Chamberlain, SD I was standing on my porch and seen a bright orange light in the sky, just below the cloud line above a row of trees in the corn field, as i stood watching it became brighter.  The first orange light began to dim and fade, and then a second orange bright light appeared about 20 feet in front of where the first orange light appeared.  It dimmed and then a third orange light appeared about another 20 feet in front of the second orange light, then a fourth appeared.  The first orange light reappeared, and then they all began getting brighter and dimming in different intervals.  The first orange light appeared to drop a flair or something the flowed down towards the earth.  The fourth light became very bright and then they all went out.  I was on the phone with my brother when I witnessed this occurring.  I was explaining to him what I was seeing, he said get the camera.  By then they were gone.;43.7953;-99.3118
