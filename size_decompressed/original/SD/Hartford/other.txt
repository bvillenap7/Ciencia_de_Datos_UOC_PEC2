Orange glowing planet sized object on horizon.;2014-01-06 23:52:00;7 minutes;orange glowing planet sized object on horizon Just west of Humboldt, SD as I was heading west from Hartford I saw a huge, bright, orange ball as big as the sun as it is setting for the evening, but this is at 10 minutes to midnight!!! Instead of getting out I decided to continue west to get to a higher point where I could take a picture and continued to watch it move from north to south along the horizon. By the time I reached the high point in the road it was gone, COMPLETELY!! Entire event lasted less than 10 minutes.;43.6204;-96.9414
