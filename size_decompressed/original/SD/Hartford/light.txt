((anonymous report));2017-04-11 22:00:00;10 minutes;Round, glows and blinks, maintains car speed and is near to me and the ground. Followed for miles, appeared to be attached to something Flew a little lower than crop dusting plane may fly, and maintained a speed of at least 65mph, as it was next to my car for at least 8-9mi.  It was a yellow/gold light shaped like the Chinese lanterns people may light on the Fourth of July.  The light flashed ever few seconds, faster than an airplane or helicopter light.  When I neared the next town and there were street lights glowing, it looked like the light was actually attached to a larger, round object.   As I drove through the town I lost track of the light, and when I reached the outside of town, I could no longer find it.
