He said some lights just went by north and looked like UFO's.   He called his brother who works for the Law Enforcement.  I went outside and looked to the North.  I said lets stay here maybe they will come back, and laughed.  Their neighbors said they all saw the lights and were amazed at how fast they went. I was looking North and I saw a small white light that I thought was a star move south towards us slowly then, it speeded up and when it came about 1/2 mile north of the housing area the light broke up into three lights.  As they moved extremely fast within 10 seconds they were above us they seemed to pause in midair with no sound.  The lights turned gold and there was no moon out that night. Then, the objects changed shape into golden flying angels.  Some of the neighbors said they looked like flying golden eagles from where they stood. Within the next second, the three objects flew at a southwest angle and disappeared completely into the dark night.  I ran in to call the police department and asked them to record it on their dispatcher log.  We talked with the neighbors for a few more minutes and I spent the night with my son and his family. i was spooked to return to my home which was 19 miles away. We couldn't even guess how fast the objects moved it was an eerie feeling watching the objects change shape.  I will never be a skeptic of ufo stories.  There is something out there I feel we are not alone. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));44.9994;-101.2415
