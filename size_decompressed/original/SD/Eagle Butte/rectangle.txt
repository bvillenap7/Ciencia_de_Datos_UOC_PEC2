My family and I were staying in a small Motel within the town of Eagle Butte the night of July 5th.  My husband and I went outside in the parking lot to smoke.  An acquaintance was outside as well and alerted us to a flaming red/orange light in the shape of a long, narrow, lateral rectangle in the southern sky, moving slowly and horizontally on a very determined smooth course, being the size of a nickel at arms length, and at an estimated altitude of 2,000 feet.   The object as it headed due north reaching closer to the horizon made a steady incline, yet it did not become smaller as most aircrafts would at an incline-it just disappeared.  It was proceeded by three more on the exact same coarse as the first from south to north. During the time of these sightings, several other people came out to witness.  There were a total of nine witnesses including a confused government contractor working for the Department of Homeland Security's Transportation Safety Administration. The next round of objects (three total) originated from the west to east (toward us) then veering off to the north. Heading in the same northern direction as the other four. Directionally as they headed toward us they appeared as round flaming red/orange balls, but as they veered their coarse to the north we could then see the rectangular shape. The night sky was very clear and there were no trails from these objects. It was obvious They had a definite, intelligent flight plan. The next day the phone system of the entire Motel was out of order.;44.9994;-101.2415
