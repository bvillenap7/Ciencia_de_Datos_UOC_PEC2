Sighted on June 10, 2004 While driving to work at 11:28 at night, I was near mile marker 38 heading east on Interstate 90 when I noticed two white lights about 15' apart flying northeasterly and to the north east of the interstate.  this put them roughly over the hills that run in the area (about 100' above the hill), there were no discernable running lights or anything to indicate it was an airplane.  the object was watched until it disapeared over the hill and no longer in view.  One other thing I noticed also was the radio fading in and out while the object was in view.;44.3692;-103.3617
