We saw a light way up in the sky that was vaguely circular.  The light flashed red green blue and yellow and  moved very fast and changed directions fast and sharp like no aircraft I have ever seen.   We saw this for a minute or so and then saw 2 military jets fly by in pursuit above our rental home. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
