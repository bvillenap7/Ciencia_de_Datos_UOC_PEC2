At the Buffalo Chip in Sturgis in the campground in front of Bikini Beach.   4 silent crafts in very close formation and very low flew over at high speed.  They were barely visible with only a glow, and so close it looked like they were only one craft.   One craft on the left side broke off from the others straight to the left. Was like a fighter jet formation buzzing the campground but silent and way fast!;44.3692;-103.3617
