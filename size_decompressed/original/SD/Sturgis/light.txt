At approximately 8:10pm MST, around 50 flying objects which were lit up flew over our house. They were in a straight line, and perfectly spaced apart. It lasted for about 15 minutes. We were unable to film as they were too far away and it was dark outside. There was actually an airplane flying underneath them that moved slower and had the lights that an airplane does.;44.3692;-103.3617
