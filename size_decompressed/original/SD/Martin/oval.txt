It was 11:00 p.m. and I was heading north.  I was looking at the stars and saw the Big Dipper and saw a ‘star’ go horizontally across the middle of the dipper.  When it got to the middle, it visually looked like it began flying straight down and I thought to myself planes do not make 45 degree turns. Then I realized the ‘star’ was getting larger and coming toward my car very fast and was not going down but coming towards me.  Then it was above my car outside my driver’s side, up quite a ways. This all happened extremely fast.  It followed my car for a few minutes and I was able to tell that it looked as big as a football field in the sky, with some lights around the edge of its kind of oval shape.  I had my window down and it made no sound at all. My little dog was in the back of the car and my camera was there, but I was too afraid to stop the car and get it to take pictures.  I watched it and in just a few minutes, it flew away so fast, I could not believe how fast it took off, going south, and then it was gone from sight.  I went home and told my mom and she said she believed me and had heard similar stories from other people in the area.  I did not report it because in 1984, most people did not believe you, so I just kept quiet except for telling my sisters.
