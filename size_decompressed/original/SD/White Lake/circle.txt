PD));2019-11-19 19:24:00;10 seconds;We just left a business on main street heading south toward I-90 when we spotted 2-3 warm white lights in the air south of our location. It appears as if one would dissapear then another one would light up so we couldn't be sure how many there were, it was between 3-5 of them. This only occurred for about 10-20 seconds before they just completely dissapeared. They were not blinking lights but solid that left with trace.;43.7564;-98.7076
