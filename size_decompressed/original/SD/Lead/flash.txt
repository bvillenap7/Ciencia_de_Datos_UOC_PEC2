Stayed in one location and flashed once every 2 minutes! My family and I were at Iron Creek Lake (located in the Black Hills of South Dakota) camping over the weekend.  It was around:00 am Sunday morning (9-12-04 - just after midnight) and I was sitting outside all by myself gazing at the stars.  It was then that I noticed a light flash in the sky.  It wasn't a big bright light or anything beyond the imagination, but it flashed once and that was it...at least that's what I thought.  I thought for a second that maybe I was just seeing things.  But about 2 minutes later, it flashed again.  So I started counting.  I was counting a little slow, but when I hit 1:45 (one minute 45 seconds) it flashed again.  The weird thing was the fact that it wasn't moving.  It stayed in the same spot and flashed every 2 minutes concistently for the 30 minutes that I watched, and it never changed locations.  I know it wasn't a satellite because I've seen satellites and it was bigger than that, and it didn't move.  It wasn't a star, it wasn't a plane, and it wasn't a helicopter.  I have no idea what it was, nor will I try to come up with ideas, but I would definately like to know what it was if anyone knows anything else about it.  If it would have been a constant light, it would have looked just like a star...I know that much.  If anyone knows anything about this, please let me know!;44.2663;-103.8691
