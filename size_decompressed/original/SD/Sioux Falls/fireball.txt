I am going out of my apartment reguraly to smoke cigaretes, and since I am working nights, I am a night owl you can say. I have seen me;2000-05-29 01:00:00;5 sec;I am going out of my apartment reguraly to smoke cigaretes, and since I am working nights, I am a night owl you can say. I have seen meteorites falling and burning, and I know satelites because I was in the military, and there is Eros Data Center here. Satelites can be seen regularly over our town. On the date of this report, I was out for the specified reason. Cool, stary night, no wind and no clouds. My atention got caught by a flash which came from the sky. It hapend on the SE side of town. Since I was facing that direction I imediately raised my head and I saw a flash trail, white at the point of impact and going through yellow to read and purple blueish at the end. The object fell from the sky coming from NE toward SSW and no sounds were heard. Back in in Europe where I am from in the mid 70's I've seen two Very weird shaped flying objects over Braila, far east Romania, coming like from Russia going west over a big industrial complex. They looked like space capsules, no insignias or writings on, and no sounds. I remeber that even tough just a kid then. Here in SF, I've seen lights flashing in the sky, but this month I've seen three lights dimer then the big dipper, considerably dimmer like the far away stars. Those lights were flying high and in app 1 minute disapeared in the sky. They were flying in a iregular shaped triangle, in sync and constant speed. And I mean they went up in the space, they just vanished going up. I am constient that they are only two explanations for such sights. Our gov secret projects or satan is cooking up something which I don't think is good for us. With respect ((name deleted));43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
