I saw a bright, large, blue shaped ball going from east to west towards the earth.  It moved quite slowly, and it was unusual looking.  The blue ball had an outer circle of white around it.  It didn't look like any kind of a shooting star/meteorite, that I've ever seen.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358

Cloaked spacecraft?  Something hidden in a cloud?;2016-11-11 21:00:00;3-4 seconds;Cloaked spacecraft?  Something hidden in a cloud? I went outside on the deck to have a cigarette like I normally do at night.  I'm always looking into the sky in hopes of seeing a meteor which is quite common, sometimes several each night.  This night was different. Out of the corner of my right eye (north) I'm facing west, I see a blur.  I will do my best to describe it...it was circular in shape, very large and very high, no noise, and moved incredibly fast in a straight line.  The only thing I can think of is it had a type of cloaking device b/c basically, it looked like a very fast moving circular cloud.   I tried to discount it as a comet, couldn't be-no tail, cloud remained in perfect shape as it sped from the north to the south across the sky and what looked like into space.  I believe it WAS in our atmosphere and than moved into space out of sight.  I've never seen anything move so fast in my life...and I was Air Force.  No lights, crossed the horizon and into space in less than 3-4 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

4 lights in a pattern.  4 lights that expanded and come back to center.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights??  PD));2018-03-04 19:00:00;1 hour;Stationairy. 4 lights in a pattern.  When i first saw it..not necessarily seen a ship per se but the lights. 4 lights that expanded and come back to a center point.  When expanded they were going clockwise in a circle.  They went from center and spread out to exact distance everyone and rotated.  Same pattern every time.  It was over a house.  So the size in comparison.. it was bigger.  I have video.  2 videos and pictures.  No sound.  Airport was 10 mi from location.  No drone either.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
Circle craft very high in the sky changing color.  ((anonymous report));2018-08-29 08:33:00;20 minutes;Circle craft very high in the sky changing color. Saw a craft very high in the sky that was white at first and then turned red.  It wasn't a jet or flight because it traveled vertically.  Also, it left behind no trails when moving like smoke.
