The object was pointed on the top side and rounded on the bottom.  Pure white light with a white tail.  Went from true north from a lower altitude (30 degrees) and shot straight up overhead (90 degrees above the horizon) and disappeared within 1 and one half seconds.  When it disappeared the light did not fade it simply vanised as if it went into a black tunnel.  The background was trees.  We live about nine miles south of Sioux Falls, SD.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
Have seen numerous objects over sky north of Sioux Falls in past few months.;2002-12-07 23:30:00;1.5 seconds;Have seen numerous objects over sky north of Sioux Falls in past few months. First off let me say that I live near Sioux Falls but would like to remain anonymous. Still can't believe I'm telling this but here goes. Around 12/07/02, at approximately 2330 hours, I observed a very bright, tear drop shaped object, travel from north to south across the eastern sky in relation to my position. The odd thing was that it appeared to travel in an upwards direction and then blinked out of sight. Duration was approx. 1.5 seconds. It was bright white in color and the light tailed behind it or at least appeared to. It is difficult to say since it was travelling so fast. I first chalked it up to something skipping off our atmosphere. Which perhaps is true. The thing is, I saw the same thing this past weekend, around 01/16/03, at approximately 0230 hours. This one was in the same general area of the sky as before. Except it appeared to travel upwards from south to north, ie: opposite direction. I am not sure what I have been seeing, but these two are not the only strange objects I've seen in the sky recently. I work outside at night so I occasionally see objects. These have all caught my eyes as I have been driving. So at least to me they are very noticeable. They have all lasted long enough to get a reasonable look at them. At last eye exam I tested around 20/10, plus I have a stygmatism on top of that, so I'm correctable to even better. Since I spend most of my time in the hours of darkness, perhaps my eyes are more sensitive to movement and light in the sky, and I'm just seeing more of the junk that's hitting the atmosphere than most others can see. Who knows. I am a college educated professional. I have doubted this stuff, but man, when you see weird stuff you can't explain, it bothers you and you really can't tell anyone about it. Especially with what I do for a living, supposed to be the unflappable one. Some who read this will understand what I'm saying with that last statement and wanting to remain anonymous. Anyhow, I see this stuff probably at least once a week over the skies north of Sioux Falls, SD. I see meteorites almost nightly, so I generally notice when somethings a little different. Well there you have it, hope this helps some people tell what they have seen. Reading the others on here helped me to do it. All I know is that there have to be more people like me, seeing this stuff and just not saying anything. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
Single very bright object seen moving through sky from North to South.;2014-08-12 13:30:00;15 minutes;Single very bright object seen moving through sky from North to South. At 1:30pm CST on Tuesday, August 12, 2014, we noticed a bright white object in the northern sky.  It was slightly West of true North.   It moved Southward (and a bit East) over the next fifteen minutes, until it was directly overhead.  At that time it was obscured by the bright sunlight.   The object was tear drop shaped, with the point downward part of the time, and to the right side part of the time.   I took some photos, but they are not very clear on the zoom.   It did not look like any airplane, balloon or other object I have seen.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
Tear drop shape was very brilliant white with red and blue tip.;2018-08-29 18:30:00;2 hours;tear drop shape was very brilliant white with red and blue tip The tear drop shape was very brilliant white and was reflecting the sun almost to a painful silver light- it had a glowing point that was blue and red- it remained stationary and did not move.  We verified through our telescope that it was not an airplane, weather balloon, hot air balloon or satellite.  The craft remained in the same place for almost 2 hours as the other stars that became visible moved around the sky.  The craft was in the atmosphere as it changed color while the sun set.  My husband used his star finder on his phone and it was NOT a star or a planet and was no where near the nearest star on the chart.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
