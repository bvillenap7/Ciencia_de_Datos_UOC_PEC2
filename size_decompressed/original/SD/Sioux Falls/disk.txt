A strange craft slowly descends from the vicinity of the star in a smooth, almost mathematical curve slightly towards us.  The craft stops and all the while rotating and flashing red and white lights revealed it's presence in the night sky.  Soon after the craft flew in a straight line away from us and remained off in the distance for the next 10-15 minutes. We had left before the ship left.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
