As I exit the building, my sister yells me to look up their, and says is it just me or is that star moving Not seeing at first due to thin layer of fog in the air I look past it and notice the star was moving,slowly silently away from us.Wheres the ID lights?  I asked. I don't know my sister says. As the object moves further from us it dematerializes and slowly evaporates.holy cow, we both shout.in excitement...then its gone,not wanting to take our eyes off the spot.all of the sudden as if to say OH ITS MY TURN a second craft of diamond star colored and shape followed in behind the previous one and then also began to move single file at that moment a third person joined us as we told her .look.look.look. wheres the ID lights she says.: We don't kno As then 30sec or so it also began to dematerialize and evaporate till completely vanished.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
