Giant white streak moving across the sky at a high rate of speed stopped and took a 90 degree turn and went straight up  and eventually;1997-11-17 02:00:00;3 minutes;Summary : Giant white streak moving across the sky at a high rate of speed stopped and took a 90 degree turn and went straight up  and eventually vanished into the night sky.   It changed colors from a brilliant white to a pale bluish hue. We were driving along Highway 11 at about 2 am at a rate of 55 miles per hour.  In the northeast quadrant we saw a bright white object tht caught our eye because it was moving very quickly.  it moved  from the east to the west and stopped on a dime it looked to be enormous and might have been seen from quite a distance .  We pulled the car over and got out to view it better. The object while it was stopped changed from the bright white light  we originally saw changed to a bluish hue.  It looked as though it was hovering over or near EROS Data Center. The cows in the field on the east side of the road seemed to be come nervous and start walking around. The object then darted off at a 90 degree angle and went straight up until it vanished.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
Glowing Orangish/Yellowish aircraft witnessed South from Sioux Falls S.D.;2008-06-08 21:30:00;3-5 secs.;Glowing Orangish/Yellowish aircraft witnessed South from Sioux Falls S.D. I was going to a freinds home that is located in the S.W. part of Sioux Falls S.D., I was on the cell phone with him to alert him I was there, the door that I will have to go through is located on the East side of the facility and he has to walk to this door to let me in. As I was hanging up the phone waiting for entry, I glanced up and noticed some very paculiar clouds that were looming of to the S.E. at approx. my 10/11 o'clock position. They were very strange in color, almost as if they were on fire from the setting sun. This was approx. 21:30, and there was no sunshine in my eye's for the building my friend lives in was blocking it. I thought to myself how unusual and how beautiful they were, when all of a sudden, an object came in from the S.W. at an incredible speed, the total sighting lasted only a few sec's, approx. 3-5 secs. and it disappeard from sight, but the profile of it is fresh in my mind.I mentioned to my friend when he answered the door, but he wasn't at my vantage point and was inside the building when this took place. I have called a local news station here and inquired about possible reports from other community sightings, but there was nothing. We have a thing called Sky Cam capabilities in my town so I asked if they were 24/7 activation, or if they are manually turned on and off, they informed me it was the latter to operate them, was hoping they were always running, they might of caught the object on tape/harddrive. Then I called the local airport and talked to the control tower, they had seen nothing on radar/Doppler from the night in question and that is when they directed me to you for reporting a possible UFO sighting, which is exactly what it was. The object was a brilliant glowing orangish/yellowish color, it had what seemed to be a golden hue all around it, there was what appeared to be a propulsion system to the rear that took up the entire distance of the area of the back of it and it also was emitting a cross between a flame and a vapor that was only apparent at the very end of the craft, it left no trails that I could see. Here's a rendition of what I seen: [IMG]http://i74.photobucket.com/albums/i246/Allred5923/possiblealien-1.jpg[/IMG] From the begining to the end of the visual sighting, it took approx. 7-10 secs to cover the plain from West horizon to East horizon. It was moving extremely fast.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
Red light object;2012-05-12 21:50:00;1-2 minutes;Red light object Talking to my sister on the pnone while sitting on my patio and saw 1 object in the sky, it was very red and moving Southwestward.   At first, I thought it was a plane but thought it was too red for a plane, then the light gradually diminished just prior to getting to me.  Approximately 1 minute later another red object came towards my direction and it too gradually diminished as if the light faded just to the east of me sitting on the patio.  The object was larger than a star and I notice a little white light with the red. At 9:52 pm, the 3rd red lighted object came and my sister said take a picture so I attemtped to on my phone but it didn't work.  It spooked me out so I came in to find a number to call but couldn't find a number in the phone book.  I opened my computer to get a number to report this and attempted to call at 10:15 but the line was busy, finally got through at 10:23.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
