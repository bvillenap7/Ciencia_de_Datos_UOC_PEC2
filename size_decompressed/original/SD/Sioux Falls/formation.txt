Eight lights in southeast Sioux Falls;2012-01-07 22:30:00;3 min;Eight lights in southeast Sioux Falls At approximately 2230hrs on 12/07/12 my wife and I looked out our back window to the Southeast of Sioux Falls SD.  We saw about eight amber colored lights in the sky.  They looked like aircraft coming to Sioux Falls for a landing except they were in no sort of formation.  It appeared as if they were heading north for a short amount of time then looked as to travel to the east and climb.  The entire time the lights would start to fade and brighten sporadically.  After about three minutes they all started to fade to the east and climb.  The last and most center of the lights was the last to fade.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
Small unorganized groups of orbs that had a goldish glow.;2017-12-04 21:40:00;~20 minutes;Small unorganized groups of orbs that had a goldish glow. I saw groups of lights flying over the city.  They were small clusters of orbs that had a golden glow emitting from them.  They went in and out of loose V formations and twisted around.  Some of them were barely visible, while others were bright enough to distinguish all the orbs inside the object.   Lines kept flying overhead for roughly 20 minutes before suddenly stopping.  A few clusters of the orb groups flew in formations of 3. ((ADDENDUM FROM READER)) There was a large snow storm the night of December 4th.  Unfortunately, I doubt anyone was able to see much outside.
