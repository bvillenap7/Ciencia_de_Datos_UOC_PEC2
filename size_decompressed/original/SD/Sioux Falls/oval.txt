Black, oval, reflective object seen gliding through the daytime sky.;2007-10-29 08:30:00;2 minutes;Black, oval, reflective object seen gliding through the daytime sky. At approximately 8:30 AM on Monday, October 29, 2007 I witnessed a black, oval object in the sky just east of Sioux Falls, SD.  It was quite high and still quite large considering how high in altitude it was. At first glance I thought it was an enormous bird based upon how it seemed to be gliding through the air. However upon further inspection I noticed that it was actually shiny and highly reflective. It moved at a fairly consistent pace, and it moved fairly quickly although slow enough that I was able to run into another room (to get a better view out of our sliding glass door) and it was still there. Again, it seemed to be gliding, but definitely not decending or falling. It went behind the large number trees in our neighborhood, and I was unable to see what happened to it from there.  Right before it went behind the trees there was a helicopter in the air which passed near it (although the helicopter was quite a bit lower in the air, it passed in the same vicinity...almost right under the object). I didn't get a good look at the helicopter so I don't have a description other than it was definitely dark in color. I was mostly transfixed on the other object. We do get a lot of hospital trauma helicopters flying over our house from time to time as we live on the edge of town, so the helicopter didn't strike me as unusual at the time.  I am a 30 year old woman and I have never seen anything like this object before in my life.  I have seen large weather balloons gliding high in the sky and I can tell you this looked nothing like a weather balloon. It was jet black with a highly reflective surface. It appeared oval in shape and moved at a medium, consistent speed. I heard no noise from it...although the approaching helicopter could have drowned out any sounds. It was a crystal clear sky, with little to no clouds and no haze or fog. And I no, I had not been drinking. :);43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
Two oval objects appeared in the sky right where unmarked planes made an X con-trail!!  ((NUFORC Note:  Contrails??  PD));2008-02-19 17:15:00;20 minutes;Two oval objects appeared in the sky right where unmarked planes made an X con-trail!! At 5pm I got a phone call from a friend in the country that saw 5-6 white unmarked airplanes in the sky leaving curiously large con-trails.  The sky was perfectly clear and there weren’t any clouds in sight.  The con-trails were different in size and makeup.  The large ones were not dissipating into the air and were left in a grid pattern from north to south and east to west.  I could tell the difference because the usual con-trails were smaller in size and dissipating into the air almost immediately after they were exhausted from the engines.  Then there was a distinct X that was made by these planes.  Suddenly out of no where there were these two oval shaped objects that were floating across the sky where the X was, not leaning behind and con-trails.  They were spaced apart and traveling east on the same trajectory.  I couldn’t see any wings and I thought it was just that they were too far away to tell but then a third plane came up behind them.  This plane had the con-trails and I could distinctly see the wings.  It was traveling in the same line behind the objects. I called the FAA and demanded answers to what was in our airspace and the operations manager put me on hold for about 20 minutes and then reported to me that the planes were an Air force training operation out of Reese AFB in Lubbock TX.  They were T-38 training planes.  Well, my father is an x-fighter pilot and retired commercial pilot and I know what T-38’s look like and it wasn’t them.  So I researched Reese AFB and it has been shut down since 1997. ((NUFORC Note:  Contrails??  PD));43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358

I'm not sure what;2016-11-05 11:56:00;15 seconds;I was at my house waiting for lunch.  I decided to go to the dining room to watch outside.  I saw an object in the sky.  I'm not sure what it was it just flying in the sky.  I estimate the object was 1,000 feet above my house and trees.   I look for my dad's phone and I found it and the object was still there and I took a picture of it.  I think it was a plane but I zoom at the picture and it was nothing I ever seen before.    The object was white appearance, windows, oval shape like a UFO, 40-50 feet in diameter and 12-14 feet high.  This the second report of UFO I saw in 2 years.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
