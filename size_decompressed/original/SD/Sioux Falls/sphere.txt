White sphere traveling at extremely hight rate of speed toward the ground before curving up into the sky and disappearing with a flash.;2017-03-04 21:48:00;5 seconds;White sphere traveling at extremely hight rate of speed toward the ground before curving up into the sky and disappearing with a flash. I was traveling west on I-90 between the Cliff Ave. exit and I-29.  I observed an airplane approaching the airport and the plane was traveling south across the interstate and preparing to landing at the airport.   After the plane had passed by and landed, I observed a large singular white sphere of light fly down toward the ground and then it changed course and curved up towards the sky again. It was traveling east to west.  It traveled as a high rate of speed and then as it came down it appeared to increase speed before changing flight path and curving up into the sky again.  As it curved up it abruptly disappeared and I seen two quick flashes of light where it disappeared.  I never seen it again.  It had no streak or tail behind it.  I was in my car but heard no jet noise.   It traveled at a much faster rate of speed than any fighter plane Iâ€™ve seen.  I also observed another plane that appeared to be preparing to land at the airport and this object streaked ! through the sky in between the two planes that were landing. At first I thought it might be a meteor but it did not have a tail and it changed course and turned up into the sky again.  It was also significantly larger than any star or flashing light on an airplane in the sky.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
