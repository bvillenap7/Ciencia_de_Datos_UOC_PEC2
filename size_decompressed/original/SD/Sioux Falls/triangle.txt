Grouping of rectangular or triangular objects, hovering, dancing around each other, absolutely silent, then rapid accleration.;2002-02-18 01:00:00;30 seconds;Grouping of rectangular or triangular objects, hovering, dancing around each other, absolutely silent, then rapid accleration. About 1 am I was outside with my dog, sitting watching the stars and I noted an airplane take off from the Sioux Falls airport. I was scanning the sky looking for falling stars etc., when my attention was drawn to a group of objects directly overhead. I can't say how high up they were, can't estimate size, but they were triangular to rectangular, a dull oranginsh brown color, and seemed to be reflecting the city lights or had a dull glow of their own. My initial thought was a small flock of geese, but as I watched I noted they seemed to be dancing around each other, changing positions but maintaining a close formation. As I watched, one of the objects swung out, moved to the front of the grouping, then began to accelerate to the northwest, with the others falling in behind then the grouping accelerated out of view. What was so striking was these objects were absolutely silent, even as they accelerated. There's a fairly large air-guard base at the airport which is a couple miles north of my residence. I've kept silent on this mainly because there have been no other reports of similar sightings in this area, and nothing about unusual phenomena reported from the air guard or airport radars.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
Triangle object without  colored or blinking lights, shortly later a bright shere shaped object was scene.;2006-02-04 19:30:00;1 minute;Triangle object without  colored or blinking lights, shortly later a bright shere shaped object was scene. I was eastbound on 57th Street and notice a small group of extremely bright lights, I was intrigued because there are no tall buildings in the area to have these lights attached and they were extrememly bright like stadium lights. As I approached closer, I noticed the lights were attached to a triangular shaped object and it appeared quite large and the lights were solid white lights at each tip of a triangle. The object appeared to be hovering as it didn't seem to move for a long time, it then seemed to rotate and slowly moved north and increased speed in a northbound direction. There were no colored and/or blinking lights visible on the craft, only the solid extremely bright white lights. I tried to follow the north bound path on Marion road but soon lost sight of it. I continued to travel north hoping to see it again and as I approached 26th St and Marion road intersection I saw what appeared to be a single white sphere come straight down from the sky and appeared as if it would have collided with the earth. It was northeast of my location but I was not able to judge it's distance from me. The sphere appeared small but extremely bright. I contacted the police department at 7:40 PM to see if anyone else had called in anything out of the ordinary and as of that moment they had no other calls regarding this but they would keep it in mind if anything came up.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
Large triangular delta wing looking 10 to 15 lights not bright dull and dim it moved very fast.;2008-03-24 22:15:00;30 sec to 1 min;Large triangular delta wing looking 10 to 15 lights not bright dull and dim it moved very fast. I need to tell you about what I just seen at 10:15pm central time March 24 2008. I live in Sioux Falls SD and had just gotten home.  I do not smoke in the house so i go out on the deck in the back yard to smoke.  at night I'm always looking at the southern sky and looking at the stars when the weather permits.  At first I thought this thing was a cloud when I seen it out of the corner of my eye.  But when I looked strait at it my heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest.  Then I thought it might of been a plane with no landing lights on coming in to the airport.  Then my eyes focused on it more and I thought it looked like a hang glider or a stealth bomber but this thing had a lot of dim blue/grey glowing lights on it at least 10 maybe 15.   This thing came in from the south east and swung in and up to the north it did not get right over head looking up I'd say it got to an 75 to 80 degree angle off the horizon.   I cant tell the distant but it looked fairly high up. If you hold a ruler out at arms length it was 3 1/2 to 4 inches wide from what looked like wing tip to tip it looked big!  From the time I first seen it to the time it faded away in the northern sky only took 30 sec to 1 min.  IT WAS AMAZING!  I am going to work on some drawings of what it looked like and the path it took,  Oh yeah it did not move like you would think some thing shaped like a stealth bomber would it looked like it was kind of side ways.

Triangle formation of lights moving quickly to the North, near Sioux Falls;2010-09-13 01:00:00;30 seconds;Triangle formation of lights moving quickly to the North, near Sioux Falls On Highway 38, headed East into Sioux Falls, I noticed two bright white lights, very low in the sky.  I thought it looked odd so I pulled over, as it got closer I noticed a third light, and it formed a triangle. There were no red or, flashing lights of any sort, just three bright lights in a triangle.  I could not see any actual craft or form, just the three white lights that formed a perfect triangle.  It came from the South and went directly over my vehicle, I couldn't make a good estimate on how high it was, however, it seemed rather low the lights were extremely bright, almost like helicopter search lights.  It moved rapidly to the North, and was out of sight just as quickly. NOTE: This was very close to the Sioux Falls Airport.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358

Triangular, 30- 40 seconds, multiple bright lights moving away slowly with no sound at all.;2013-01-08 00:00:00;30 seconds;Triangular, 30- 40 seconds, multiple bright lights moving away slowly with no sound at all. I was just arriving out at the expo Building at the Sioux Empire Fairgrounds when I came around the corner and saw a low hover craft which I first thought was a helicopter from the near by Hospital.   This craft was making no noise and started to move away from the fairgrounds as soon as I turned the corner around the building to see it.  It moved very slowly away heading south easterly.  It slowly increased in altitude as it moved away.   I watched for several seconds in disbelief and had a very eery sensation come over me.  There were several lights on the craft, way more then an aircraft would have and they were so bright that it seemed to mask the actual shape of the object, though I concluded it was a triangular shape based on the points of the lights.   The lights were blue, red, and yellow.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
