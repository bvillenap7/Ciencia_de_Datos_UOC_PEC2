3  Moving   Star Sized Lites Grace South Dakota Nite Sky;1992-07-28 02:00:00;30 min;3  Moving   Star Sized Lites Grace South Dakota Nite Sky One person witnessed streak of lite from ground to 30-40degrees from horizon in NW sky 2-5 miles Nth of Soo Falls. Pointed out to 2 others who began to verbally describe activity without dissent.Initial lite observed by this rptr.to be size of bright star moved horizontally 5degrs. then nolite,then lite observed to be mvoing in opposite direction approx 10 degrs. from former position. 30-90secs.later joined by another lite,then both lites moving up down or sideways-but also doing turns horizontally or sudden reverses of directionthen briefly joined by 3rd lite which streaked in from 10degrs. left of others at which time they maintained respective left right position within 5 degrs. of each other where rptr. said they played game or danced for 15-20 secs.Then 3 human witnesses reported  sightings to others.  Rptr. 10-15 mins. later observed shooting star streak go thru same sector.Then rptr. saw streak in NE sky as if fixedstar within field of vision accelerated at high speed away from rptr. and out of sight.skipping some detail and others observations,rptr. then went with 2 new observers and 1 orig'l obsvr.when rptr.asked 2 observers which thing they were viewing.1 new observer pointed out orig'l one which was moving slowly and horizontally lft and rt and compared to approaching airplane with landing lites on.  Airplane getting brighter and brighter and brighter than prvious brite star sized lites and obsever pointed out the unusual horizontal motion of the one as compared to the airplane's path which was predictable and approaching Nth end runway (5 miles out?)then we looked back to horizontal moving lite then rptr. looked back at airplane (formerly 10degrs. right of horz'l moving lite and plane was gone.)Rptr. asked new observer where plane was and observer said didn't know.Plane would have flown overhead but no lites no sound no clouds-plane gone.If military,we win.If not,we must be somebody's zoo.(Sometimes objects moved from 0 to very fast without appearing to accelerate as most non-! physicis ts would use that term.)Possibly swamp gas or weather balloons that lite up and move fast or don't move at all or move in opposite directions and then disappear.Possibly jet powered helicopters flying close to each other near airport not worried about airport area or flight restrictions or crashing into each other by playing game and flying close but not crashing when lites turned off.

My husband and I were driving south on Interstate 29 going to Sioux Falls. When we were about 6-7 miles north, of the city, I was looki;2004-11-11 12:30:00;approx. 5 mins;My husband and I were driving south on Interstate 29 going to Sioux Falls. When we were about 6-7 miles north, of the city, I was looking up in the sky watching for the usual airline traffic from the airport. I used to live in Sioux Falls not too far from the airport and loved watching the planes and am well aware of all types of conventional air craft. The day was clear and sunny with just a few lines of whispy clouds. I was watching one jet fly over, east to west and then another came along also, east to west. A little higher in the sky, I noticed a bright round, white,light like a nickle at arms length and, I am estimating about 60 degrees off the horizon to the south and a little west of the city. It was very bright and appeared to be flashing though, it could have just been the reflection of the sun. At first I thought it was another plane but it didn't appear to be moving and didn't have a contrail as the other planes did. I asked my husband if he saw it and he said he did. It appeared to be moving in and out and above and below the clouds and would fade out from time to time. When the second plane came over, I noticed another light of the same type lower than the second plane and on the same course. It disappeared after about 5-10 seconds, the other one was still visible. I pulled to the side of the road to get a better look and try to get some pictures. It disappeared as we drove on, then, it reappeared and I pulled off onto the off ramp and drove down another highway looking for a gravel road so I could park and watch it. It was still in the same place in the sky and still doing the same things. By the time I had found a gravel road, it appeared to be higher up but still in the same place and barely visible, then it was just gone. I did notice another plane come from the airport, circle around at a lower altitude in the direction of the light but, don't think this pertained to it.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
One, spherical light orb that is slow moving then rapidly accelerating up into clouds.;2009-07-26 15:00:00;2.5 minutes;One, spherical light orb that is slow moving then rapidly accelerating up into clouds. The craft I saw was round sphere shaped object that had a orange-yellow light to it. It was a cloudy day and the craft was moving fairly slowly in my direction.  Then it stopped probably about about a mile away from and proabably two thousand feet off the ground.  The object was probably about the size of a house.   After it was stationary for about 35 seconds, it flew straight up into the clouds.  I could see it disappearing through the clouds with the affect of a flashlight shining in smoke.  I found it very werid because airplanes always fly from east to west over my house and this was coming from the south going north.  And I don't think there is an aircraft known to have a flight pattern like I saw that evening.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
Hovering flashing lights moving up;2010-10-12 06:07:00;10 minutes approx;Hovering flashing lights moving up Light was flashing red and white. Low in the sky.  I did not have my glasses on at the time and thought it was a helicopter.  Then I realized there was no sound. It was hovering so could not be a commercial aircraft.  I got up, put on my glasses and go my camera out.  The object then moved away from me - not in a compass direction - but up while lights kept flashing.  Object moved up and too far to be seen after approx 10 - 15 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.

Bright light like space station but brighter and moving in strange ways unlike aircrafts;2011-09-20 06:33:00;6:33;Bright light like space station but brighter and moving in strange ways unlike aircrafts Today, that is Tuesday September 20th 2011 my girlfriend and I were on our way to the car from our apartment to go to work. On the way to the car I looked up as I do often when the stars are showing but it was 6:33 and the sun was about to come up so there was only 2 showing, And I thought that one of the stars was Brighter than normal at that our in the morning, the other being the north star or whatever star is almost directly straight up (I just call it the north star because I thought that was supposed to be the brightest star but I'm to lazy to do the research). I told my girlfriend to check it out... and she said I don't think that's a star i think its a plane or something because its moving.... I replied yeah it is moving isn't it?, but its to bright and its not blinking like airplane lights and it looks to high anyways maybe its the space station and somethings going on up there that's why its like testing that's why its so bright. Now what happened next is something almost like what I always see on u tube videos when I look up UFO videos.... instead of just flying straight and really slow like the space station always does.... its speed increased, then slowed, then slowly increased again and started curving like a car would to take a corner going right at an intersection, i don't know how else to explain it because it didn't turn a little or alot, but then curved back the opposite it then faced when it took its right hand turn and curved in the shape i would compare with a car making if it was to do a u-turn like a perfect half circle then I lost track of it in what looked to me like above the clouds. I Said to my girlfriend Wow that's not the space station did you see it turn like that? she said yeah its probably an airplane. I replied NO WAY, Airplanes don't turn like that they bank.. and they don't turn left and right and speed up and slow down, or have lights that bright, and besides, don't they blink? I really think We just saw a UFO. She laughed it off but I'm pretty convinced it was something.. I'm not saying little green men but I Am sure it wasn't an airplane or the space station... and not a star since we both say the same thing its not that we where getting dizzy looking up. I wanted to call the airport and ask if there was something wrong with a plane or something but that sounded stupid.... so I called 411 to see if there was anyplace to report this kind of thing and she suggested the police department and connected me... but I couldnt see it behind the couds and I wasnt about to tell a police officer I thought I saw a UFO. So i asked my girlfriend to look up on google who you call if you see an unidentified flying object and she got your hotline so i left a message this morning. I mean the whole experience probably was under 45 seconds.... It wasnt some long drawn out deal but it thought it might be important to tell somone I just wish i would have gotten it on video on my iphone, and still wish I had been able to talk to the airport and see if maybe some plane was flying manually in different directions or malfunctioning to explain the fluctuating speeds. Just thought I would tell SOMONE. So this is it I did and thats all I know and saw this morning.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
Bright rapid moving light;2012-11-06 17:45:00;5 seconds;bright rapid moving light Ending a cell phone call and getting out of my truck a light streaking from the North East horizon traveling West at  VERY high rate of speed caught my eye.  I saw the object as it reflected the suns light and it disappeared in the South Western horizon.    It was moving extremely fast, and left no tail like a shooting star, comet or object entering the atmosphere.  I can't explain in words how fast this object traveled from one horizon to the other and was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

An orange bright light pulsating over the east sky going south in Sioux Falls, SD, at 9:00 pm on January 12, 2013.;2013-01-12 21:00:00;2 minutes;An orange bright light pulsating over the east sky going south in Sioux Falls, SD, at 9:00 pm on January 12, 2013. It was an orange light going across the east sky going south. It would become really bright, then dim, bright, then dim. It was moving very slowly, but there is no human aircraft that can compare to what we saw.  It kind of looked like two tiny things stacked on top of one another when the light was dim, but then looked like one when it was bright.  I wish I could describe it better... the orange color was very pretty and vibrant.  A mix between bright orange and a dull orange. After the first minute, the lights became even dimmer, then disappeared all together.  It had the same slow glide the whole time.  It did stop for a split second, but it literally was barely even a stop..  It was strange.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358

My husband and I were out in our back yard at 10:30 pm talking.  I was facing south and he north. It was dark.  All of a sudden I see this very bright redish orangeish ball of light come up and over my neighbors house flying very fast and very silently.  It flew from south to north and made absolutely no noise.  Not a plane or a helicopter.  We've never seen anything like it.  Maybe a drone? I don't think so.  It flew a completely straight line, not wavering from it's path at all.  We watched for about a minute and a half until it was behind some trees.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358

A Huge bright light (white) was falling from the sky in an east to West direction.   I thought at first it was a falling star, but it was way too close to the ground.   I posted what I saw on Facebook, and another witness saw the same bright white light at Marion and 57th in Sioux Falls, light also heading west.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
