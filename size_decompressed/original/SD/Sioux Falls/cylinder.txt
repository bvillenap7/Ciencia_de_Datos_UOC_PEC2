The Ufo was white and a cylinder shape.;2015-06-28 11:42:00;East 63rd street;The Ufo was white and a cylinder shape It was 11:42 am in Sioux Falls near E 63rd street 57108.  The ufo was silent.  It was a cylinder shape.  I show one of my neighbor of the ufo.  It was flying 575-600 mph.  It had no wings, no tail section, or propellers.  I'm started to be a believer of ufos.   Years ago my cousins saw a ufo too in Hartington, Nebraska.  It was unbelievable that I saw one.  It was 10,000-20,000 feet above the ground.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358

At first, I thought it was a top of a radio tower but I couldn't ever remember one near there.   I continued watching and pointed it out to the driver.  My eyesight is better than his, he could see it but couldn't tell what it could be.   It started to move towards the water tower and went behind it, before this I assumed that it was closer than the water tower but this told me that it was bigger than I thought.    When it came out from behind the watertower it look like it had changed position, shape or it was fading out because soon after it emerged it disappeared.   It moved slow but smoothly, it seemed to shine before it emerged from behind the watertower.  It was cylindrical from my angle but it could have been saucer shaped.   I believe it couldn't have been a plane or helicopter because of its appearance and how it moved, I believe it might have been a weather balloon but the fact it wasn't moving when I first saw it makes me doubt that too.;43.5286242924528;-96.7307285377358
