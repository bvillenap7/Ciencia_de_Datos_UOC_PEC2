Numerous orange lights seen outside of town.;2012-10-03 08:24:00;2 hours;Numerous orange lights seen outside of town. Was on our way home and saw these lights appearing over and over in the sky North, North-West, and West of Wagner, SD.  They would appear then quickly fade back out, looked something like the famous Arizona sighting.  They were orange balls of light that would appear for a few seconds then disappear.  At one point I saw them in a really tight cluster moving horizontally to the ground way up in the sky.  It was almost as if they were flares being dropped by airplanes because there was a lot of aircraft activity going in the sky as well.  Apparently this has been going on for the past couple of days now, can anyone see if the military is dropping flares or something?;43.0856;-98.2804
Orange lights over Wagner/Lake Andes area. May be flares, can anyone confirm?;2014-07-02 22:00:00;5-10 minutes;Orange lights over Wagner/Lake Andes area.  May be flares, can anyone confirm? Numerous orange lights were seen in the sky.  Fireworks were being set off but there were too high to be any.  They seemed to be flares again as they went out after a while but there isn't any Air Force bases around here.
