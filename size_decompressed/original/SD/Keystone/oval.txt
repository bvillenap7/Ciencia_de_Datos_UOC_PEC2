UFO photographed near Keystone, South Dakota.;1981-09-27 15:30:00;3-8 seconds;UFO photographed near Keystone, South Dakota. I took this photo a while back. We had a family reunion in South Dakota. I didn't realize that was in the shot, I was just trying to  get all of Mt. Rushmore in the picture. Once i pulled my eye away from the view finder, i noticed it. I told my family to quickly turn and see it. The object was there for another good 3-8 seconds. It flew away really quickly but it was just barely slow enough to remain visible as it traveled, until it was out of sight. It seemed to be emitting some sort of aura, but it was difficult to tell because it was such a hazy day.;43.8848;-103.3995
