Bright Orange Tire Size Orb.;2017-07-24 00:00:00;2 minutes;Bright Orange Tire Size Orb. Hiking along Devils Tower Trail Number 4, around midnight with a group of 6 people.  We stopped for a break about a quarter mile up the trail from the Sylvan Lake trailhead.  We noticed a small orange bright object hovering to the west.  The object slowly hoovered from west to east traveling at about 10 miles an hour.  It went directly over us and was about 150 feet above our group.  Not a single sound just a bright orange object the size of a car tire.  After about 2 minutes it disappeared into the night.  Flying in a perfect line and not making a single sound as it cut through the air.;43.6573;-103.4258
