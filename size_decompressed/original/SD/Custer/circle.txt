Orange Lights East of Custer, SD;2011-07-22 01:30:00;5 Minutes;Orange Lights East of Custer, SD My wife got up to let the dog out about 1:30 A.M.  She saw several bright flashing orange lights an unknown number of miles to the east.  They were stationary and she had no idea of their origin.   I, the dutiful husband, was sound asleep.   She watched the lights for a few minutes and returned to bed.;43.6573;-103.4258
