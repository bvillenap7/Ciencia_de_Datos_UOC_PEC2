Ripples in the sky, and bright flashes of light.;2015-06-23 01:00:00;25 minutes;Ripples in the sky, and bright flashes of light. There are a number of rippling chevron waves throughout the sky, it has been going on for the past 25 minutes, still going.   At times there are bright flashes of light, much like a shooting star but there is no trail.  Also, quick moving objects have appeared a number of times.   The ripples become lesser and less frequent and then another bright flash appears and the ripples come back stronger and closer.   We've ruled out fog, shooting stars, and the possibility of seeing the northern lights.   This is unexplainable to us all.;43.0084;-96.632
