A triangular shape light that hovered for about 2 min and then just faded away.;2003-02-12 06:35:00;2 min;A triangular shape light that hovered for about 2 min and then just faded away. I noticed a different light in the sky that morning.  To low to be a star and too high and bright to be a yard light.  The way it hovered, and the color of the light was like a bright orange/yellow street light.   I knew it wasn't a plane or chopper.  I was driving south on Hiway 37, mile marker 146, southeast about 2-3 miles was a bright triangular shaped light.  I watched it as I drove.  It moved a little as it hovered.  After about 2 minutes, the light just faded.  I didn't blink, and I couldn't believe it was just gone that fast.  I continued to watch but saw nothing else.  It was the neates thing I ever saw!!

It was flashing different color of lights and moving up and down.;2013-08-26 08:14:00;3 minutes;It was flashing different color of lights and moving up and down. I was on the school bus at a stop to go pick up other kids when my friend and I realized that there where different color flashing lights moving back and forth at an angled position.   The sun was rising and so it was hard to see the lights.   When I was talking to my friend and I looked back it was gone, but it looked so close but yet it also looked so far away.;44.3567;-98.2245
3 red glowing lights.;2014-11-13 19:05:00;20 seconds;3 red glowing lights. At approximately 7:05 PM central time on November 13th of 2014, I was requested by my daughter to go outside to see something.  She directed my eyes upward to the night sky looking east.   As I looked up I saw three glowing red lights spaced a distance apart but maneuvered as one giant unit.  The lights appeared in an obtuse triangle shape.  The object was at about a 45 degree angle from my point of standing to the lit objects location in the sky.  The glowing circular red lights were each just slightly bigger than a large glowing star in size but the whole object would cover just under the size of a typical South Dakota November full moon (assuming by movement these were all one large object and not three separate moving simultaneously.)   It appeared to glide through the sky.  In about a sixteen second time frame it moved south-southwest approximately 6 inches from where it began to where the lights just vanished.   It was moving in a very slight angle, under 5 degrees from start to vanishing. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness and found her to be quite eloquent and sober-minded.;44.3567;-98.2245
The UFO looked BIG.;2014-11-13 21:00:00;1 minute;The UFO looked BIG. I had seen three reddish orange lights in a triangular shape moving to the east.  It was dark out, so it was easier to see 2 of the 3 lights but when I got a better look at the unidentified object the 3rd light was behind my tree.    When I went to go get my camera and turn it gone I looked to see if it was there it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  No time was indicated by the source of the report.
