Red flashing lights that apeared randomly across the sky.;2009-05-15 00:00:00;15 min+;Red flashing lights that apeared randomly across the sky. I saw with my mom and her boyfriend, a series of flashing red lights popping up in the night sky in random places.  It could not have been a plane or a light tower used for planes because it would flash in one part of the sky, then it would flash in a completely different spot. It never flashed in the same spot more than once.;44.3567;-98.2245
Extremely bright light moving SE at a fast speed.;2013-06-20 23:05:00;10 minutes;Extremely bright light moving SE at a fast speed My husband and I were standing on our deck, he was blabbing on about how work went today when I was staring at the moon. All of a sudden I see this extremely bright light appear out of no where, I got my husbands attention, at first we thought it was just a airplane, but this light was just one singular, extreme bright light shinning down, it was moving southeast at a fast speed.  We watched it for about four minutes before it just disappeared. After trying to figure out what we just saw I looked up in the sky at the opposite direction of last sighting, and noticed another bright light, not as bright as the last one, moving about.  This one was a little different as it didn't fly in a straight line, but would fly for a couple seconds then drop down a little bit, and a couple seconds later fly upwards again, this continued for another 7 minutes to which it finally disappeared.;44.3567;-98.2245
