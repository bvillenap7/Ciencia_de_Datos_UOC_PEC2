And these lights seem to be hovering and making quick side to side movements overlooking the trees of Wakpala..  They stayed til 7:30 am..  The biggest light made a noise wich sounded like the trumpets in the sky that were heard around the world..  They then all start gaping back up into the atmosphere..  One noticed me and turned around and start coming towards me.. It came so close to me then went invisible..  But i can still see its eye.. It examined me about ten minutes and was gone..   I now regret being so brave to let it see me..  The reason why is that it somehow altered my mind and i now see alot more of them and they r always by me..  And its very scary..   I am npw in the hospital with doctors telling me im crazy but how can i be crazy when i have proof of my hallucinations..  Scared wishing i had help..
