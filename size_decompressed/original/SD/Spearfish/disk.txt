Classic saucer.;2016-11-26 18:00:00;30 minutes;&quotclassic&quot saucer We saw a bright light in SW sky, much brighter than stars.  When I got out a spotting scope you could see it was strobing colors.  When I put it on highest power it was clearly a flattened disk with different colored lights on edges.  I went outside to take a picture and it had dropped 15 to 20 degrees and now sat right on the horizon.  This was a matter of a minute or two at most.  It was in the clouds and I couldn't get a picture.;44.4974;-103.8669
