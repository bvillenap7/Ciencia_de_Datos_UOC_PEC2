I saw a cigar shaped, glowing blue object travelling at a high rate of speed.;2002-09-06 20:30:00;1-2 minutes;I saw a cigar shaped, glowing blue object travelling at a high rate of speed. I was outside on my back porch and saw an object at cloud level in the southwest sky travelling at a high rate of speed toward the southeast.  It disappeared from sight into the horizon after transversing the entire sky.  It was cigar shaped and appeared massive in size.  It glowed the entire time.  The color of the specific cigar shape was like a bright blue gas flame.  There was a long white trail behind it that was sparkling.  My husband got to the porch in time to see the tail dissappear.  The entire event took about a minute.  It went behind the clouds at times and lit them up from behind.  There was absolutely no sound at all.  It was amazing but also frightening.  The cigar shape was defined but glowed around the edges.  There were no blinking lights and it appeared to be at least 20 times the size of a B1 Bomber both in length and width.  I was the only witness at my home except for the trail of white light which my husband saw.  I did learn later that a child in Rapid City ( 45 miles SE) saw it too.  In addition a young man and his mother saw it in Chadron, Nebraska which is south of Rapid City around the same time.
