I was looking at the stars to the west, and realized that one was moving.  It was moving down really slowly, and then it would stoot back up from where it started so fast that it looked like it disappeared and then reapeared.  It did this for a long time.  Then I noticed another object, that looked like a star also, coming right for the first object that I saw.  As it drew closer, it became brighter and brighter.  It seemed to happed in slow motion.  When it got to the other object, the other object shot down to the point that it was originally was going down to almost instantaniously.  The object that was coming toward it got really bright and disappeared.  The object stayed here about 10 minutes, then started moving to the north at the same speed that the object that was coming toward it was going.  About 4 to 5 seconds later, it was gone.;44.4974;-103.8669
