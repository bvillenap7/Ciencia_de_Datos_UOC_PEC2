Two bright lights seen while driving;2012-12-22 02:07:00;5-10 seconds;two bright lights seen while driving We were driving between Wallace and Florence heading south on Highway 20 In South Dakota at about 2:07, when we both saw a very very bright bluish green blob of light go diagonally downwards towards earth, and ground.  The only problem we have is how far away it was, as it was slightly foggy.  One says it was about 30 yards in front of us, and heading directly into a field near us, and another says that it was more up in the sky, like closer up with the stars and heading somewhere off in the distance. Obviously this is a big difference, and we might even think it was an asteroid or something burning up in the gravity and friction. When we were near Watertown, SD, still on highway 20, I saw another one, but only caught a glimpse of it, and it appeared to be duller, but still the same color was definitely lower than the first, and slower, but more on earth, like not so much in the stars.  We have no idea what we saw, but we saw something.;45.0554;-97.2866
