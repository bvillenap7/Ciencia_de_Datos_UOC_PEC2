On November 19, 2007 while on a deer hunt in Lyman County, South Dakota, my son and I were sitting in the dark at approximately 6:30 a.m. waiting for first light. I spotted a very bright white light that was moving across the sky and pointed it out to my son and asked him if he thought it could be a satellite or an airplane. We both agreed it was far too bright and too close to be a satellite or airplane. Plus, it wasn’t making any noise. With the naked eye it appeared to be round in shape, but when I checked it out with my binoculars it looked more triangular. It continued to move across the sky from west to east. But what REALLY got our attention was when two much smaller circular lights flew right past it going the opposite direction and then appeared to circle around behind it. Surprisingly we weren’t really scared, but more interested than anything else. Could it have been some bizarre military flight, or was it truly a UFO? I’m convinced it was, even though no one really believes us. My son is a young teenager and I'm a late 40's business executive with no science background. This was a unique experience for us and something we'll talk about for a long time. ((NUFORC Note:  Overflight of ISS.  PD));43.8897;-99.8528
