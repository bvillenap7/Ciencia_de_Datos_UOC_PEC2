It was approximately late morning.   The student who was about 9 years-old noticed it first.  She asked me what that thing was in the sky and I had no clue!   Here it was broad daylight and this object was hurtling through the clear blue sky.  It looked like some sort of cylinder with a sort of handle projecting out from it.  The handle appeared to be rotating.   We both thought it looked like it was jump roping.  That was how the movement would be described.  I don't remember it having any lights but it was going extremely fast.   It was too high up to get a better idea of the exact shape.   I was just struck by how odd the movement was.   By the time we found somebody else to see it it was gone.  I just assumed that it was a falling satelite or maybe even some type of spy surveilance that had fallen out of orbit but I have always wondered what it was for sure.;43.5514;-97.4749
