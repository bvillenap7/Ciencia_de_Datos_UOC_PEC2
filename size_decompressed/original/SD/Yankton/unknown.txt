I looked up into the sky and I saw a yellow/orange light that appeared basically out of nowhere and it seemed like it was close to us.   The other witness said that the shape of it was weird like it had points and there were two lights on one side of it and one light on the other side.  It moved somewhat in a straight line but it wobbled a little.  As it continued to move it began to fade away into the sky.  I watched it until it completely faded away.;42.8822;-97.3906000000001
