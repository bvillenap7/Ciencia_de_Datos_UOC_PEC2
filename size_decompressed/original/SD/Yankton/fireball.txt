Orange fire ball that made a weird humming noise.;2014-01-02 20:00:00;5-10 minutes;Orange fire ball that made a werid humming noise. On 01/02/14 at about 2000 hrs I was on the east edge of town.  I saw an orange fireball hovering near a local factory.  While the object was hovering, there was a humming sound that I have not heard before.  After about 5 minuets the object moved at a high rate of speed heading north. I heard on the police scanner, that the local sheriff's office has also received a call about the same object and a deputy was dispatched to the area.  I do not know if the responding officer saw the object or not.;42.8822;-97.3906000000001
