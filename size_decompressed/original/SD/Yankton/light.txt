T;2011-08-15 21:00:00;1 minute;I was told to come outside to view something that my friends saw in the sky because I have seen a UFO at one other point this summer.  This time it was one light that moved across the sky.   The light just suddenly stopped in the middle of the sky and I thought to myself what kind of aircraft can just STOP in the sky and not begin to fall down to earth?  Then the light began to move across the sky again and I ran down a block and it was gone!;42.8822;-97.3906000000001
Steady deep red light.;2012-06-29 23:30:00;5 Minutes;Steady deep red light. I was driving home, west of Yankton, SD, on Highway 52 near Lewis & Clark Lake at about 11:30 or 11:45 when I noticed a deep, steady red light slowly traveling from the south to north across the lake. I had my window down and didn't hear any sound. There were no blinking lights like a normal airplane. Just a very steady light. I tried to take a video with my phone, but I'm not sure it showed up, since it was so dark. It was a very dark orange/red color and faded out when it was about straight in front of me, or just slightly to the right of the highway. It didn't seem very high in the air. I'd say about the same altitude that a small private plane would fly. Seemed to high and steady/smooth to be a flare or some sort of long-lasting fireworks. I'll be interested to hear if anyone else reports anything, since there are a ton of people camping at the lake. I would imagine a lot of people had to have seen it.;42.8822;-97.3906000000001

2 orange lights hovering slowly before flickering out west of Yankton/North of Gavins Point Dam;2020-08-22 22:30:00;30 seconds;2 orange lights hovering slowly before flickering out west of Yankton/North of Gavins Point Dam 2 orange lights hovered very slowly and at a uniquely slow pace to the West of Yankton just North of Gavins Point Dam.  One started to flicker off and on in a manner that a normal operating aircraft would not do.  It was completely silent and had no noise of an engine.  The first orange light eventually went dark as if it sputtered out.  The other orange light continued to move to the west until it too flickered out.  Even though I could no longer see the orange glow, I felt as if I could see the objects still moving as I could see them traveling in front of the stars in the night sky.;42.8822;-97.3906000000001
