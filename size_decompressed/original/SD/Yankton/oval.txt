5 white lights coming towards me as flying object;1995-08-15 06:00:00;1-2 minutes;5 white lights coming towards me as flying object was putting laundry in my van and turned around and looked west to the sky. saw 5 lights that were solid and moving towards me from the west. stopped and hovered which wasnt long. and moved south towards yankton, sd. and took off very fast and disappeared.  I was scared and in awe at the same time because i didn't know what it was. the following day heard on radio that others saw it and they said or announcer said it was meteor shower. but i think it was a ufo in yankton, sd.   this was in the mid 90's and in summer to mid fall as i remember not having a jacket on was a warm early morning around 6:00 am. i didnt hear any noise.  I will never forget it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));42.8822;-97.3906000000001
