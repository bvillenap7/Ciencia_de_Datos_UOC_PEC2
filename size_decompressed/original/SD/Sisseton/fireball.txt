Armageddon or Deep Impact  type fireball cruises over South Dakota;2004-09-02 22:43:00;5 seconds;Armageddon or Deep Impact  type fireball cruises over South Dakota On 9-2-04 at about 22:43 my wife and I were watching tv inside our house when my wife said hey, hey, hey, look! and was pointing out our living room window which faces due North.  I jumped up and looked outside and witnessed a huge fireball traveling low on the horizon in a straight line from West to East, it then curved downward and disappeared.  It was bright and from our house it appeared the size of a basketball, white in color and traveling slow. It also didn't leave a streak or a trail and when it disappeared it didn't appear to break up or anything it just faded out.  I am a Security professional with 12 years experience observing and reporting at my job.  My wife works in education.;45.666;-97.0691
