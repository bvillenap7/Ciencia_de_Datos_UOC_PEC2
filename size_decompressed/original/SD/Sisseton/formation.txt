Strange jet fighter formations in the middle of the night.;2003-08-30 23:15:00;4 Minutes;Strange jet fighter formations in the middle of the night. On the above date and time at approximately 23:15 my wife and two younger brothers witnessed a formation of lights fly overhead as they sat outside smoking a cigarette.  My wife hollered for me to come outside and look at the lights which I did.  I noticed at least 6 bright lights, 2 non-flashing white lights in front. and five red flashing lights in the back   flying to the East in a large V shaped formation, they weren't flying very high or fast and they gave off a low rumbling sound somewhat like a jet.  As the formation went over my house they suddenly broke their formation and were moving around.  The whole event was startling to witness.  One of my brothers was hollering at me to get my camera.  I told them it would not pick up the lights so there was no use trying to take a picture.  I called the Sheriffs Dept. at about 11:30 to see if any one else had reported these lights.  The dispatcher said no one else called anything in.  Then at 12:03 a.m. another formation of lights flew overhead just like the first formation, heading east and a little to the North.  We had all decided to stay outside to see what was going on at this point.  And then again another formation of lights just like the first formation flew over at about 1:15 a.m heading in the same Easterly direction.  I am assuming these were fighter jets going overhead but the first formation seemed a little odd, the lights in front of the formation didn't seem like aircraft lights.;45.666;-97.0691
