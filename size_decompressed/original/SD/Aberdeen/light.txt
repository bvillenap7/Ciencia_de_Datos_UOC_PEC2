There was no tail behind the object, which was much brighter than any plane I have ever seen, certainly much brighter than a star or meteor, and roughly ovular in shape (so bright that shape was hard to determine).  The object was silent.  The object moved at a seemingly high rate of speed before slowing and starting to fade, though it would pulsate a bit while fading.  Eventually the momentum stopped altogether and the light faded out while stationary.  I observed this for about 3 minutes between first looking up and noticing the light, and when it faded completely from sight.;45.465480597015;-98.4809462686567
