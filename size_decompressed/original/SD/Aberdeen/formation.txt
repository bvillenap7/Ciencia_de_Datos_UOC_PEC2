Orange balls shooting into the air and forming a check mark formation.;2009-12-31 23:00:00;3-4 minutes;Orange balls shooting into the air and forming a check mark formation. I was arriving home from work.  I stepped out of my car and saw several orange balls shoot into the air.  I thought at first it was fireworks since it was New Yearâ€™s Eve.  I walked to the end of the driveway, maybe 5 feet to get a better look without tree limbs in my way.  The balls made a formation that looked to me like a check mark.  They hung in the air for a minute or two.   I started to walk into the house, all the time looking at the orange balls.  In the time it took to open the front door and tell a relative about what I saw and tell them to come outside and see it too, the balls were gone.  We went around to the back of the house, thinking that we may be able to see it back there.  Nothing.  All of this happened on the south side of town.;45.465480597015;-98.4809462686567
