((HOAX??))  Saucer/disk seen by one middle schooler in Brandon, South Dakota.;2018-07-12 03:15:00;3:25;Saucer/disk seen by one middle schooler in Brandon, South Dakota. I was on the bus heading home.  When I looked out my window to see three saucer shaped disks flying.  You might think my head was playing tricks on me nut I swear I saw these flashes coming from these saucers.  At first they were moving slow then at a quicker pace each second.  I turned to tell my friend but by the time she looked out the window the saucers were gone.  Lots of people thought I was crazy when I told them about it on the bus. I swear I saw three disks flying around that day, and I am not crazy.  Well this all was happening I noticed that I felt sick to the stomach and got red blotch's on my skin for a short period of time.;43.5856;-96.583
