Two silent stars hover vanish when jet nears;1994-07-21 22:00:00;ten minutes;Two silent stars hover vanish when jet nears On 21 July 1994 two local women spotted two very bright starlike lights around 10:00. The lights were red and white respectively.  They made no noise and didn't move.   They watched the skyshow for about ten minutes--it ending when the object/objects disappeared as a jet plane entered the area.

5 points of light moiving quickly and erratically at different times;2003-04-25 21:00:00;30 Min;5 points of light moiving quickly and erratically at different times Points of light moving more quickly than sattelites,somewhat herkily and not quite in a straight line. All seen within about 15-20 min of each other. First one appeared as a light increasing in intensity then fading, then moved southeast, next  one northwest, then 2 southeast, then 1more appeared overhead with a bright flash, faded, and moved southeast.  About 5-10 min later 4 different aricraft moved through the area although appeared to be at lower altitude-identified as aircraft because had port and starboard lights and strobes on and 1 was low enough to be audible.  We are an hour's drive from Ellsworth Air Force Base.;43.4237;-103.4765
