It got bigger and bigger as it came closer. Lasted about 5 seconds. When it stopped in a blink of an eye there was a green glowing object like a glow stick, of 3 bow shapes the front bow was around 300 feet wide. The other 2 bows faced backwards from the 1st. About 50 feet between the front and rear bow shapes. Connecting all 3 shapes was a pale green glow, like a fluid like membrane that you could see the stars through. As it flew over the house, about 300-500 feet high, the green light went out and a metal surface lit up by the lights in town appeared. Moving only a few miles an hour. No lights on it or windows. Then disappeared from view. Lasted 50 seconds in all. Never made a sound.;43.4237;-103.4765
