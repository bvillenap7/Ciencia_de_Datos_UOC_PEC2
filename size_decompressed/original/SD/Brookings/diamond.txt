That is, until it began to move.  I wasn't startled, as I've seen strange UFO-like objects in the sky many times in this town before.  As a night-owl, I've become quite accustomed to seeing them.  The star started slowly moving and then stopped.  Short red and blue lights, beams if you will, shot out of the bottom of the star.  After about 10 minutes or so, it disappeared.;44.3063512195122;-96.7872853658536
