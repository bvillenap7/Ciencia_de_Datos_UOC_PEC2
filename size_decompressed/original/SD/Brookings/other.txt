Strange fast moving silent orbs seen over South Dakota skies.;2009-05-08 12:30:00;8 seconds;Strange fast moving silent orbs seen over South Dakota skies. Last night I went outside a little after midnight to let my dogs outside and water my strawberry plants.  When I was done watering my plants I leaned back on the trunk of my car to light a cigarette facing north, when I thought I saw a shooting star in the sky and did a double take.  This was unlike anything I have ever seen and was not any civilian or military plane at least not any that is publicly known.  It appeared to be one craft however I could not make out an outline of the object.  One very dim orb was leading the other dim orb except what made this so strange to me was that the orb in the rear was visibly offset  from the other, meaning it was not directly behind the first, almost diagonally behind and to the side of the first dim light.  It moved from east to west, then almost lost sight of it behind a big tree, but I ran excitedly to the other side and caught a clear view as it proceeded west until it faded off on the horizon line.  This object was extremely fast and did not make a sound. I ran inside after I lost sight of it, and grabbed my camera and walked westward for half an hour but was unable to see anything else.  It was very exciting, I am still very excited,  I live by a small airport and often film the airplanes, and growing up I lived by Forbes Field Air National Guard Base, one of the largest airstrips in the United States, and I would often see F-117's and B-2 Stealth fighters and bombers, even flying low and in formation in the day and at night, and though stealth's look very creepy at night and fly in triangular formations, I can identify them for what they are, and this was no military plane that I have ever seen.  Thank you very much for taking my report.;44.3063512195122;-96.7872853658536
