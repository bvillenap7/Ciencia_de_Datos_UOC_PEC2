Triangular Shaped Drone;2020-01-19 18:30:00;<1 minute;Triangular Shaped Drone Object over Interstate 29 south of Brookings, SD. I was driving southbound on I-29 about 10 miles south of Brookings at 1830 when I noticed stationary lights over and slightly to the right of my lane, approximately ¼ mile in front of me.  As I approached them, I leaned and looked up at them out the top of the windshield, and I could see the silhouette of the object against the sky.  Appeared to be a triangle, with green, red and white navigation lights at each point of the triangle, and I'm guessing 10 to 15 feet across, and an elevation of ~300 feet.  No noise could be heard over the engine noise of my truck.  Temperature was –5F.  I could relate this to a large drone, but awfully weird to see someone flying one for the fun of it in subzero temps at twilight.  I do have a short video of the object, albeit not very good.;44.3063512195122;-96.7872853658536
