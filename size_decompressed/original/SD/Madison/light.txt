I was walking back to my home on my nightly walk. It is a full moon, so the sky was lit up very well.  Is I peered to the left, something that looked like a shooting star shot up from behind a garage across the street. I have seen shooting stars, and this was not a shooting star.  The figure was seen for about 5 seconds, and after that it was no longer visible.  It was rather large, and had a radiant aura surrounding it.;44.01;-97.1145999999999
