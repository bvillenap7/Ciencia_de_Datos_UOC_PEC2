I was driving north on 470th avenue west of Dell Rapids near the intersection of 470th avenue and 243rd street when I saw a blue flash of light NNW of where I was.   At first I thought it was one of those planes, you know, that have the little trail behind them?  But then I realized it was going to fast.  It moved towards the ground very fast and I only saw it for a few seconds.  I didn't see where it went or if it landed or crashed, although I can't imagine anything falling at that speed could land safely.  It was white in the center, but the edges of whatever was falling and the trail it left in the sky looked bright blue.  It seemed like there was some sort of blue haze around it.  It fell smoothly and without any other motions.  It's hard to say if it was glowing or not, given that it was rather bright and cloudless outside, but it seemed to be to me.  I didn't get any pictures or video, as I was driving and it happened relatively quickly.  It looked to be about th! e size of a honeybee, from my perspective.;43.82;-96.7213
