Silent, triangular shaped object with no lights!;2015-10-31 20:00:00;30 seconds;Silent, triangular shaped object with no lights! It was Halloween night.  My sister and I were standing out on the back deck after handing out candy to the trick or treaters.  It was about 8:00 or so.  It was a very clear, starry,  cool night.   She looked up and pointed at a silent, triangular shaped object flying directly over our heads at a pretty fast pace.  It was traveling southeast.  We watched for about 30 seconds, then it was out of sight.  It appeared grey/metallic--it almost looked transparent.  We both thought it was strange because there were absolutely no lights on this object.  We only saw it because the lights of the city reflected against it.   We have an air base in Sioux Falls.  This didn't make any  noise like the fighter jets that sometimes fly overhead.  It was definitely an unidentified flying object because we can't explain it!;43.82;-96.7213
