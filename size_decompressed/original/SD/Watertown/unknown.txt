The contrail left by this craft was all that was visible.  Probably a high altitude/high speed Recon aircraft.  Its contrail is long and wide and definitely NOT a commercial plane.  Cloud conditions permitting, the sightings are observed and recorded.  The flight path this time was from West to East.  This could be the government's replacement for the Aurora.;44.9048;-97.1243000000001
Unknown reconnaissance craft possibly fron Nevada or Califorinia areas..;2012-05-16 11:15:00;2 minutes;Unknown reconnaissance craft possibly fron Nevada or Califorinia areas.. This is the second time I have reported this craft.  In my opinion it is a reconnaissance aircraft (replacing Aurora?) and it leaves a long and broad contrail and is silent.  It is NOT a commercial flight!   The contrails usually appear from the North heading South and from the West heading East.;44.9048;-97.1243000000001
