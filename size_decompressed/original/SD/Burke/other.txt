Air Force bombing runs mistaken for UFO's;2005-09-20 22:00:00;40 seconds;Air Force bombing runs mistaken for UFO's My wife and I were returning to our home in Mills, Nebraska. It was about 10 pm traveling north on HWY 137, north of Newport Ne. We observed two orange objects falling like flares  in an area over or north of Burke, S.D. We then came to an interchange to proceed on Rt. 12 to go west and then again in the sky to the north we observed 5 more orange objects, they were like round flares being droped from an aircraft, each one lighting up, one after the other in a horizonal line.  Then one final  large flare falling lower. Upon watching we noticed a plane was droping these flares. I am sending this because we read in the Norfolk paper, that someone reported seeing a flying saucer that same night. I believe that the Air Force Base in Rapid City was busy that night with practice bombing runs over the Missouri River. Might be related.;43.1844;-99.2984
