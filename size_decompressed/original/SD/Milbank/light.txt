Notice single white lights  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-18 21:00:00;15-30 minutes;I was taking my dogs out and I was looking up at the sky at the asteroid light and night sky like normal. I notice single white lights equally spaced apart, no sound from them for being so high in the sky, moving from the West to the east at a fairly decent speed. I called my wife and son out to see it, because it was something strange in the night sky. I counted 10 at that moment and as I looked to the east I noticed more lights heading the same direction and then vanished.;45.2141;-96.626
