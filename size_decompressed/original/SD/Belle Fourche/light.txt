Flashing in an off pattern.  The light slowly began moving away.  Then changed directions and headed towards us.  We heard no engine noise.  After it got within a certain distance, it disappeared behind a nearby hill.  There appeared to be three lights.  Red, green, and white.  They all had their own pattern.;44.6743;-103.8451
2 lights appear one over the other, both ascend, slowly disappear.  Saw same last 3 nights.  ((anonymous report));2019-05-14 22:00:00;10 seconds;2 lights appear one over the other, both ascend, slowly disappear. Saw 1 light same area last 3 nights. The past 3 nights I've seen a single star-shaped light appear, then fade out.  I am familiar with stars and often watch the sky.  This star-like light seen three consecutive nights. Low and behold, tonight, in the same spot, as I go out to smoke my pipe, there are 2 lights that appear, one above the other.  Both rise slowly, then disappear. Moments later, I saw 4 or five lights in formation flying in that general area, these were flashing.  I watched and several lights just disappeared, but one did a circle and flew back from direction it came from.  I also heard a jet engine.  I wonder if jets were sent to investigate?  Why did several 'jets' disappear?   Also, I took motorcycle ride yesterday to Alzada Montana then to Hulett, Wy,...I saw two different military-style 'outposts with people inside fenced areas.  The second one (100 x 100 feet fenced?) had a amtrak like vehicle with a gun turret?  I hear jets flying overhead now 22:12.;44.6743;-103.8451
