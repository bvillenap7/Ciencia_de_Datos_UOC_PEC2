Saw 3 round yellow  orbs in the NE sky last night at 6:23 pm (approx).  Two lights together (like on an airplane wing) and one in front.  The two,lights together came closer together then went back to the airplane wing formation.   The third light stayed in front.  The lights stayed at the same altitude and were in the same area of the sky.   As I drove north saw this phenomenon again.  Saw this event three times. ((NUFORC Note:  HOAX.
