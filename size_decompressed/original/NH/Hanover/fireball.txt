Green fireball lasting a few seconds only, must be other witnesses out there.;2011-10-25 20:59:00;2-3 seconds;Green fireball lasting a few seconds only, must be other witnesses out there. I was walking away from the CT river and saw a green fireball, lasting only a few seconds in the eastern sky.  At first I thought it looked like ignited falling ash from a green firework, but there were no fireworks around.  There was no sound either.;43.7019;-72.2827
