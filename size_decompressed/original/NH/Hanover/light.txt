red light landed slowly in the woods;2007-04-14 00:00:00;10-20 seconds;red light landed slowly in the woods I was going to sleep and then I saw this red light coming into my window, then I got up and walked to the window, and astonishly, I saw a sharp red light slowly landing down about 100-500 meters (I was really not sure how far) away and then when it disappeared while it entered the woods behind a house.  Then I thought it might be an UFO, so I waited for several minutes, but I did not detect any more red light, so I went back into bed and kept staring outside the window for a while before I fell asleep.;43.7019;-72.2827
