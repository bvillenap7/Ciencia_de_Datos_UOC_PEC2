In the sky straight ahead of me I saw a white circular object that I thought initially may have been a star still visible.   The object remained there for about 5 seconds, then just disappeared instantly.  I never took my eyes off it so I know I didnâ€™t just lose sight of it, it simply disappeared from the horizon.;42.82;-71.8545
