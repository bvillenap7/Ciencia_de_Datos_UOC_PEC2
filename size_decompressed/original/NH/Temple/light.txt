I had my lower strength glasses on, so I popped my contacts in and watched this for a good 15 minutes. It's worth noting it is windy tonight, with some clouds. This light was SO bright and just above the tree line. It would dim, get super bright, blink a little, and darted a little to either side, then back up!!!! It would get dim while the stars around it stayed the same brighness. And just like that, it was gone. I waited 10 minutes and it never came back. I'm still shaking. That was breathtaking! 100% drug and alcohol free.;42.82;-71.8545
