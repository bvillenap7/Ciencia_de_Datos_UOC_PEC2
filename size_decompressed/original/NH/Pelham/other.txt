It was a clear sky during a cold night. It was somewhere between 7:15pm and 7:25pm. A very large, and white colored glowing object appeared in the sky, seen from the truck my father and I were in. The object was larger than a full moon, but gave off an illumination similiar to what a star looks like in the night sky.  The object was to the south.   As soon as the object appeared it started traveling to the right (to the west).  It looked as if the object was at an elevation somewhere where an airplane might fly.  The object was moving at very fast speed, and using both of my arms to make an angle, it continued traveling westward for about 4 seconds, making roughly a 20 degree angle from where i was sitting. At the end of its movement, a thin orange streak shot out of the east side of the object.  A half a second after this happened, the object dissapeared instantly. My father also had the same observation of this object.  The only other known probable witness was another car's driver, who was in front of us and pulled over seconds after it started, and went back on the road after we drove by.;42.7288;-71.3046
