They hovered for a handful of seconds, and in perfect unison, and very quickly, the three formed a perfect triangle.  The triangle hovered for about 10 seconds before darting into the distance, faster than anything I have ever seen.   Before its departure two other independent lights emerged, one hovered by itself for a minute and then took off while the other took off a few seconds prior, both following the original 3 that formed the triangle.  The triangle remained in its shape until it was out of sight.;42.7288;-71.3046
