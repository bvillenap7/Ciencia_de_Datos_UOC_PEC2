triangle object seen by 2 people;2006-01-18 16:20:00;5-10 min.;triangle object seen by 2 people I could not believe my eyes, this thing in the sky appeared out of nowhere it was looking at me as if i were about 6 feet from it, i was driving down a main road and it appeared to the right side of my window as if it were following me and then dissapeared, again i looked around and there it was just looking as if it was not moving at all in the sky this time it was farther away it was shaped like a triangle and i could only see a black and grey color. I stopped on the road to try and get a better look and i could see it hubbering over the same spot and then out of nowhere this thing vanished. I read the paper the next day and a man who was an airplane pilot reported the same incident to the newspaper, no one believed me then when i saw that someonelse had seen this odd object i felt like i had someone out there that saw it too.
