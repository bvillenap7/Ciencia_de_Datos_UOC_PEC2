It sailed through the sky directly above our back yard without any kind of noise.;1991-05-25 21:00:00;2 min;I don't talk about this very often, but it has been heavy on my mind lately.  It has been over 12 years now, but the experience is still so vivid for me.  I was on the deck at my parents house relaxing under a starlit light in their hot tub.  I was just sitting there, when suddenly the jets in the hot tub turned off.  I reached to turn them back on, when I looked up to see this huge...enormous shadow coming over the treeline.  It moved so slowly, yet so deliberately.....at about 2mph.  I stood up and stared straight at it...It sailed through the sky directly above our back yard without any kind of noise.  At the time I wasn't really afraid.  I watched as it filled most of the visible sky between the trees in the back yard.  There were bluish/whitish lights on the bottom of it, but they were not very bright.  As it left, the hot tub jets turned back on and I just sat there in disbelief.  I think that I wanted to believe that it was just some military experiment out of nearby Pease Airforce Base, so I really never talked about it to anyone other than family.  Last winter I found your site and was thrilled to see that other people have had similar encounters.  I am reporting this because it is still so clear in my mind and I believe that what I saw was not from this world.;42.8836;-71.1741
