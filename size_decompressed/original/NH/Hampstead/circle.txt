Round shiny extremely bright almost silver-looking object over day skies;2011-01-13 07:30:00;3 minutes;Round shiny extremely bright almost silver-looking object over day skies On my way driving into work this morning, I noticed in the sky what appeared to be an extremely bright almost silver looking object, which appeared to be round.  It was very high, so I thought it was a falling star at first (because it was coming down and at an angle almost like down a rainbow), but then realized that stars to not fall slowly and this tended to descend at an angle and then went sideways very slowly for about half a minute and disappeared. I pulled my car over and it was gone. Nowhere in sight.  It was so bright and shiny almost silver that I thought it was a falling star.  However, do stars fall that slowly fromt the sky? I dont know.  Maybe it was? I dont know, but just thought I would report it. It definitely was not an airplane.  It was low enough to make out the shape, but high enough and bright enough to not be able to see any particulars about it.  I wanted to take a picture, but by the time I pulled over to look outside, it was gone.  Anyway, just thought I would report it.   Thank you for taking the time to read my report. :) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.8836;-71.1741

A circular object shot across the sky in about 3 minutes it disappeared.  While it was moving it had a zigzagged motiton to it.  It was very bright and did not flicker.  Three men saw it and were amazed. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.8836;-71.1741
