Bright Light In Sky Over Rockingham County, NH;2008-01-13 05:20:00;2 minutes;Bright Light In Sky Over Rockingham County, NH woke at 4:30am and was sitting at my kitchen table working on my computer. At or about 5:20am I looked out of my kitchen window, wich extends from top of ceiling to about 1 foot from floor and about 6 feet wide and faces west with a 90 degree viewing angle west to south and ground to ceiling level.  I looked south and noticed a very bright light in the sky at about 70 degrees in the air from ground surface. Distance and height of the object is not known. I thought to myself thats a really bright start.  About 30 seconds after noticing the light an aircraft moved in the direction of the light coming from an easterly direction proceeding west at a steady speed (possible proceeding to Manchester Airport). I'm positive it was an aircraft - it had a single white light and a flashing red light on and off every 1 to 2 seconds - and was moving in a steady horizontal dirction going west.  The light faded and then vanished. It did not move east, west, or north. I looked around for other stars in the sky and could only see one or 2 stars so I suspected cloud cover had obscured my view. Its now 5:55 am and the light has not come back.;42.8836;-71.1741
