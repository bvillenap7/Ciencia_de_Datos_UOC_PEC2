bright light descending slowly in the east/northeast;2009-05-12 21:35:00;0:1:30;bright light descending slowly in the east/northeast I had gone outside tonight, 5/12/2009, approximately around 21:35 to take the dog out. I had looked up to see a really bright white (star-like) light in the sky. I noticed it descending slowly. At first I thought it were just my eyes, but after watching for about 10 more sec I knew I was definitely seeing it correctly. I immediately ran inside and yelled to my husband to come look at it. We both watched as this bright light descending very slowly behind the hills in the east/northeast. This light was almost 2x's the size of the brightest star/planet that had been just to the left of the light when I had first noticed it.;44.9082;-71.4808
