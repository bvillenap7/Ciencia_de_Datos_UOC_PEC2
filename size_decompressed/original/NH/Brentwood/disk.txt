The route I use takes me through an area with a history of various UFO sightings and encounters. I was driving on a backroad, with lots of open space and farmland. I just so happened to look to my right, and I saw a very distant object, hovering in the sky, just above the trees. To the lower left of it was another disk-shaped object, only slightly larger, and glowing white. Both were stationary but floating. I didn't get to look for long, as I didn't have time to pull over or I would end up being late. I tried to capture what I saw with my phone, but the images and brief video aren't the best quality.  As stated earlier, I do live in an area where UFO sightings are somewhat common. Many of the sightings had been on the exact road I was on. Later, on my way back from work, I took the same route and saw some strange activity then too. As I was driving in pitch darkness, I saw two different flashes of light, several minutes apart from each other, in completely different locations, that seemed to come from nowhere, with no noise to accompany them.;42.9827;-70.9472
