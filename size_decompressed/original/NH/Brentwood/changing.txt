Definitely not an airplane;2021-06-11 18:15:00;2 minutes or less;Definitely not an airplane The object changed shape. It first appeared oblong then seemed thin and then back to larger oblong shape. The object seemed to cloak or disappear for a few seconds also. This all happened as I approached exit 7 on 101 East and then turning onto 125 Calef Highway in Epping NH. I am extremely interested to see if anyone else saw this object. Please send updates if other reports are made.;42.9827;-70.9472
