Floating lights over treeline;2013-02-05 19:30:00;15 seconds;Floating lights over treeline I was driving my two young kids home when I saw what I thought was a radio or cell tower in a residential neighborhood in town.  It was quite lit up and it looked like there was a have beneath it.  It appeared to have multiple white lights in a diamond or circular shape with one red light to one side.  It was very low to the ground and unmoving.   I continued to look at it as I drove, for about 15 seconds total.  It didn't move at all during that time and was quite bright.  It seemed to be right above the tree line, maybe a half mile away.  I drove by the same place the following morning and there was only sky to be seen in the space.;42.8637;-71.5132
