Verticle row of hovering lights in the southern sky moving east to west.;2013-09-20 01:05:00;still happening;verticle row of hovering lights in the southern sky moving east to west. I went out on the front porch to have a smoke around 1:00AM. Noticing the full moon i could see few stars.  I was drawn to a shooting/falling star,  Then off in the same general direction i noticed 3 or 4 vertical lights hovering east to west and then west to east. Back and forth but moving in a westerly direction.  At one point i saw what appeared to be a small bright light or orb shoot out from the center of the row and was shot west, with the light vanishing quickly after leaving the lights.  I used the tree line to be sure it wasn't me moving. I could see these lights through the pine trees they were bright.  I have never seen this site before googling it tonight.  I did a search to see if there had been any other reporting of light formations like this.  It is 1:35AM now, i am going back out to see if it is still hovering, because i lost sight of it due to moving behind trees.

Cloud unveils circular white light.;2014-08-28 05:00:00;10 minutes;Cloud unveils circular white light I was sitting on my front steps and noticed a small wispy cloud to the Southwest.  The cloud began to swirl somewhat and then moved aside uncovering a circular white light.   After 1-2 minutes, the cloud began to swirl again and covered the light and it disappeared.   Shortly thereafter, I said to myself I wish I could see that again after which I experienced this again although it had moved several miles away in a straight line.   The object was the size of my thumb at arm's length and at an angle of 10-15 degrees above my location.  Total time of both sightings was around 10 minutes.;42.8637;-71.5132

White light moving slowly and changed direction;2017-04-15 23:58:00;6 minutes;White light moving slowly and changed direction I have a wireless security camera in my shed with motion detection.  It records 30 second clips with infrared night vision.  A mouse keeps triggering motion during the night.   On the night in question the camera shows a flash of light (1 frame) over the neighbor’s house, left side of the clip.   Next clip shows no light.   Next two clips show a definite white light on the right side which occasionally blinks (maybe goes in and out behind trees?) and moves slowly left and up until, at the end of the last clip it is going out of range of the camera.   Not an airplane.  Only a white light and it changes direction.   Several of us watched the clips over and over and can’t figure out what else it could be. ((NUFORC Note:  We have viewed all three video clips, and we do not know what the small white light is.  Clearly, it is moving slowly, at approximately the angular velocity of a satellite in low earth orbit.  The ISS was not visible at the time and of the sighting.  We do not know what the object is, although it may be the landing light on a distant aircraft.  PD));42.8637;-71.5132
