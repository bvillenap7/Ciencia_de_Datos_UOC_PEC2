Round orange object in late night sky, no tail;2020-07-12 23:37:00;1-2 minutes;Round orange object in late night sky, no tail I was on my dock below the trees.  I saw an orange round object flying overhead with no tail.  It was under cloud cover going in a straight line. I had to run up my dock stairs to follow it.  I saw it through the trees and then had to run to the front of my house to keep following it.  It continued in a straight line until it the trees blocked my view.  There was no sound I could here.  It lasted about 1-1/2 minutes.  There were no blinking lights.;42.8637;-71.5132
