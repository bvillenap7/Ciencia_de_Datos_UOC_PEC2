Like a planet, but moved about.  Not an a/c. Round, bright when magnified. Distant, hard to hold in viewfinder.  ((NUFORC:  Venus.PD));2004-03-11 19:45:00;10 MINUTES;Looked like a planet, but moved about.  Not an airliner. Round, bright when magnified. Distant, hard to hold in viewfinder. In the western sky I saw a bright round object about 20 degrees above the horizon.  At first I thought it was a planet, such as Mars or Saturn.  I stared at it, and I noticed the object moved around at random, not particularly rapidly. There was no trail. The light emission was steady, not blinking. This moving object was confirmed by a second observor who said it looked like a Mercedes Benz 3-pointed star without the circle around it.  I put the videocamera on it and at 20x zoom it appeared to be a sphere.  It was difficult to keep the object on screen when at max zoom, so I conclude it was a good distance away.  We are in a flight line to the Manchester, NH Airport (it is 4+ miles NNE) and see a lot of planes, usually coming in from the SW but occasionally from far away in the West.  A plane came in as I was videoing this object, so I put the camera on the airliner for a contrasting shot.  It was not comparable to the object.  Planes are steady, this object was mobile horizontally and vertically and is not like any plane or star I have seen before. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus may be the explanation.
