I seen what I think may have been a small craft that darted across the sky like a flash but it didn't really look like a craft more like a superhero going into hyperspeed as silly as that sounds. It had a blue green glow.  It shot off North, North-West and it was in our atmosphere. It felt like it was close by. A few seconds later, there was a flash in the sky directly North which look like a star exploded.  it was pretty bright, but a quick flash. The Flash was a bright white light.  There was no star there before or after. Perhaps it was a portal?The Object was more west of the bright flash and at a lower altitude.;43.0286;-71.1922
