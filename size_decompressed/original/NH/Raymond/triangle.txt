Triangular object with multi-colored lights  hovering at treelines;1977-06-01 00:30:00;2 Minutes;Triangular object with multi-colored lights  hovering at treelines Myself, My brother, and my cousin were sleeping.  Loud jetlike-whistling noise awoke myself..strange because I never had heard a jet before in Raymond NH. Ran outside through front door and observed large well-lit triangular object with multi-colored(green, white, blue, orange, red)flashing lights on bottom hovering just over large pine tree in front of house. Note: No street lights in community where I once lived. I started screaming to my brother and cousin to come out see the object hovering above me. I ran into the house screaming in excitement and then ran back out..object was gone(no sign of its departure,no more sound).  I then called my parents who were in Boston at the time to tell them what I had witnessed..didn't call local authorities because they wouldn't believe me anyway. My brother and cousin heard and were awakened the noise but didn't see the object. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD));43.0286;-71.1922

The craft was triangular in shape,as far as we could tell the craft was black except a small white light on each corner and a huge flourescent pink light in the center which flashed every minute illuminating the entire street.  The craft continued to move souteast at a speed that would make modern air craft stall it was going so slow. The craft made no noise not even a humming tone.

It was three bright white lights evenly spaced out to form a triangle and appeared to all be on one craft.;2014-03-10 20:00:00;5 minutes;I was driving east on rt 101 and noticed 2 bright lights close together out my drivers side window in the distance as I approached exit 4.  I watched it for about 3/4 of a mile of driving on rt 101 east past exit 4.   The lights appeared to be hovering in one location and as I drove I started to notice a third identical light forming a triangle with all three lights and I did not see any blinking red lights or any blinking lights at all like on a plane.   I pulled over in the breakdown lane after seeing the shape of a triangle and got out of work van and the craft shot away extremely fast going southwest and disappeared extremely quick.   I kept looking around for it and even got off exit 5 and turned back on rt 101 west and drove back to exit 3 to see if I could see it at all anywhere again and it was nowhere to be seen not even in the distance.   It was three bright white lights evenly spaced out to form a triangle and appeared to all be on one craft.;43.0286;-71.1922

Saw what seemed like an airplain very very low in the sky, until I got closer and saw that the three bright lights were just a few feet above a tall pine tree on the road.
