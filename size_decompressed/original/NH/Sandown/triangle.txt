Watched for 30 seconds or so and the i saw, what I thought was a plane, but it wasn't.  It had 3 lights facing down, like dull headlights on a car. And a flashing red light, I think in the center.  It was following the first smaller craft.  I watched it go south west until I couldn't see it anymore.;42.9388;-71.1837
