Bright white, round, wingless, object traveling steady from West to East.;2017-08-08 21:00:00;30 seconds;Bright white, round, wingless, object traveling steady from West to East. A very bright, white, round, object passed over my house, from West to East, at 2100 hrs.  It appeared to be approx. 3 times bigger than how a large star/planet would appear, and it seemed to be much lower than where most large aircraft would fly, possibly 3 or 4 thousand feet.  There was not a contrail.   Many airplanes fly overhead, and no matter how high up they are, they can be heard.  I could clearly see that there were no wings, no blinking lights, it moved slowly and steadily and was silent.   This is the second time I have seen this type of aircraft on this same route.  The last time was in October 2016.;42.9388;-71.1837
