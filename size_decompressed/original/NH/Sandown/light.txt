On 5/27/2019 at 11:24 me and a friend were on my back deck in Sandown, NH.  The view on my deck is a full tree line from east to west.  It was a clear starry night with the North Star almost right in the middle of our view. A little west of due north just above the tree line appeared a really white bright star.  I said to my friend “is that moving” and within a few second we realized it was coming right at us from about 5 miles away.  I immediately thought to myself that it was a jet airliner considering the speed it was coming at us.  I thought it would be cool to get a video of a jet flying extremely low directly over my house if I could be fast enough.  So I ran to grab my camera from inside. I was inside for about 15 seconds and returned to see the bright light about 2 miles away. Oddly enough, it was completely silent no engine noise or nothing. Just as the light was about 2 miles away it all of a sudden changed course from roughly straight south to rising into outer space with no hesitation.   The light that emitted never blinked, stopped or strobed, it just got brighter as it got closer.  It traveled straight up for about 5 seconds when I said to my friend “it’s going to disappear”.  Not a split second after that when I finished fumbling with my camera, the object did just that and faded out and was gone. I know this was not a commercial jet, satellite, balloon, drone, etc.  The size was big enough that I thought it was a jet.  It was brighter than any star right from the get go to only get brighter.  It was always the same white light and did not change color.  We later seen a couple more unexplainable strange flash bulbs but nothing like what previously happened.;42.9388;-71.1837
