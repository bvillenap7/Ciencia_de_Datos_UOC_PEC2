Tried to start brand new camera would not operate completely locked up trying to prepare invade of another occurrence. 30 seconds later in same vicinity but uncomfortably closer in earths atmosphere a large bright whitish orb appeared out of nowhere and started traveling east for 45 seconds before disappearing behind my backyard tree line. Full moon more blue than black sky but no clouds at all visible stars.  No flashing light no colored flashing light like a plane not a helicopter way too big for any type of drone and completely no noise dead silence. Once object vanished multiple dogs or coyotes began to howl all around my area.  Got spooked out and went inside.;42.9388;-71.1837
