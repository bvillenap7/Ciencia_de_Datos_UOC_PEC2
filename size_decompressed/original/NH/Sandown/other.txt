Dark black shadow blazes through the night sky;2016-12-22 01:24:00;2 seconds;Dark black shadow blazes through the night sky I was watching the clear night sky other than some distant clouds in the horizon.  A jet black beam, shadow, or wave barrels across the sky and disappears.  Since this is not a object or something that emits light I have no idea what it could be, potentially a form of Aurora borealis?  It raced behind the clouds with a section still to be seen above the clouds speeding through the sky, so it is in outer space or appears that way.   I have seen this before in but has been smaller multiple sections following each other, extremely fast and just cut across the sky and disappear.  They almost appear as lines like in the parenthesis as a example (I, ll , lll ) but almost fuzzy like a low lit shadow along the edges.;42.9388;-71.1837
