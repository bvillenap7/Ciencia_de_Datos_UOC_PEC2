Another smaller light appeared to float around this larger light. The object appeared initially as a star or celestial body. Upon viewing (for 4 minutes), irratic movement and red and blue lights persuaded viewers (I and my wife) that this was not an airplane or a celestial body.  I (a 36 year old software industry professional) watched for 40 minutes while my wife (a 31 year old at-home mom) watched for 10 minutes and was drawn away by our 2-year old's waking from sleep.  During my viewing, I contacted the local (1 mile away) air force base (a satellite tracking station) and asked whether they could view it, either by sight or by radar.  The individual who answered indicated that they had no radar for that purpose but agreed to go out an view it himself.  After a follow-up call, he indicated that he did believe he saw these.  I contacted the local airport's sherriff's office to ask them to call the tower to see if they could view this craft.  No follow up with the airport.  I also contacted an airforce base some 60 miles south but the tower could not view it. The shape was difficult to acertain..it simply looked star-like. During the last ten minutes of viewing, the object moved off to the right. Having contacted the UFO Center, it was suggested that I get a tripod and film it.  After 5 minutes search, I found and set up the tripod but by the time I returned, the object had moved off.;42.9725;-71.6919
