Multiple orange balls in the sky.;2013-11-20 17:50:00;5-7 minutes;Multiple orange balls in the sky While driving home on Rt 3A going north out of Bristol around 17:50 hours a large bright orange ball appeared in the NW horizon and at first we thought it was the planet Venus.   Then we realized that it wasn't because it was in the wrong location and then it just disappeared.  Then about 2 minutes later we turned left onto West Shore Rd and several more bright orange balls appeared in the sky toward the NW.  They came into the sky quickly and brightly.  They lined up in a row or formation and we saw 6 of them.   We immediately found a place to pull over to watch them.   My husband turned on his video recorder on his phone and we both got out of the car to watch them.  There was another vehicle parked by us and the gentleman in it got out to observe them too.  They went from orange to a bright whitish color and then went dim.  Then all of a sudden they started flashing different bright lights (red, yellow,white) and more appeared.  Then they took off in different di! rections rapidly.  As they were leaving they would flash brightly every few seconds.   All 3 of us were mesmerized by how they were flying off so fast and we could see their flash way off in the distance.  My husband did get them recorded.   Once we got home and uploaded it to the computer, we realized there were actually 10 of them.  We uploaded the video on youtube.com.  Please note in the video, we didn't capture the orange bright color.  We captured them after they went to the whitish color and flashing.;43.6076;-71.7423
