Much brighter than any star in the sky.  And it appeared to be moving.  It was pretty far out, but you could see it perfectly fine.  It moved slowly then would stop, and then repeat until it faded out. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.6076;-71.7423
