Reddish orange circular craft spotted over New Hampshire conservation area.;2013-08-10 22:00:00;30 seconds;Reddish orange circular craft spotted over New Hampshire conservation area. At approximately 2200 hrs. on 10Aug2013 while at a camp near the Bennett Conservation Area in Bristol NH, 7 adult males and females witnessed a circular reddish orange craft travel from the West to the Southeast at a slow and straight direction.  The lone craft had visible smaller lights around the edge of the circle. The lone craft was silent while  moving in a straight line.  The sighting lasted approximately 15 to 30 seconds.  It was difficult to estimate the distance of the object from the ground.   At approximately 30 seconds into the event the trees prevented us from seeing the object.   Less than 10 minutes after the event two helicopters began circulating the conservation area.  My first visual of an UFO.;43.6076;-71.7423
