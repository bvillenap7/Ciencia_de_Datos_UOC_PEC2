And I was watching them. I was driving home from work when I saw in the cloudless sky a silver sliver over hills of Grafton Co..  As I was getting closer to Bristol {Grafton Co.} I lost site of it behind trees. Getting closer to where I live the sun was starting to set,  As I  came around the hill on rt.104 there were 2 of them . One was at an angle one way { \ } the other { / }way.  One was a little higher above the  other.   The orange red glow of the sun set was reflecting off the bottoms of them, as if they were watching the sun set. it was so cool.
