My wife, friends and I were sitting on the front porch having coffee when a fast moving very bright light caught my eye coming in from the east. It stopped and remain stationary for some moments and started to move very slowly to the nne over the treeline. I have 34 seconds of video with my iphone.  No sound at all.;43.6076;-71.7423
