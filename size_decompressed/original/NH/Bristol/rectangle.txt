Building shaped object  w/lights moving west in mountains;2003-09-17 22:00:00;7 min;Building shaped object  w/lights moving west in mountains I Live on the side of a mountain and spend many nights outside with telescopes and binoculars gazing upward... I can see the milky way band from my porch and usually walk my dogs at night with all the lights off so I may get the best possible view of the sky... There is pretty much zero light pollution in my area so my space view is amazing.. anyway I was walking my dogs and was scanning the super clear sky as usuall when I saw a shooting star and then moments later an extremely large rectangular object appearred from the east and was heading west... I am familar with aircraft dating back to WWII and this was unlike any I have ever seen... It looked like a building on its side with many lights... I say it looked like a building cause the lights resembled tiny windows... Kind of like a skyscraper on its side... I did hear engines (unlike jet engines) and its was moving very slow almost to slow to be flying.. I did not see any wings and there were no other craft around.
