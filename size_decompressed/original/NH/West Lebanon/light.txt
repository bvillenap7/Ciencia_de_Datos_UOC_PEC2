We walked the same paths each time through the grave yard and past the school and back around to our appartment.  One day we stopped at the grave yard and sat down by the veterans memorial on the plot.  I looked up and said Wow, the sky is really clear tonight. Me being fasinated with the stares keeped on looking up for about 5 minutes, when all of a sudden I see something that i thought was a star start to move.  I ask ((name deleted)) if he saw it move and he said no, so we both waited to see if it would move agian and it started to move agian.  I asked ((name deleted)) did u see that!? and he replys Yes! What is that?!  In amazment we layed down and watched this object that looked like a simple star dart across the sky, stop, then quickly jerk in the opposet direction.  We've gone back there many times after that night and we almost always see these objects.  I have even brought my girlfreind there to witness them.  This one night I was looking up and saw what i thought was an octigonal constalation of some sort, but when one  of the stares broke off and started moving i was really suprised, then another would break off.  I am really confedent that if almost anyone would just simply look up at the sky at night for more then 5 minutes...some of those things we think are stars..might just be a discised ufo!  I've done resurch on ballons and satalites and nothing comes close to this.;43.6448;-72.2971
