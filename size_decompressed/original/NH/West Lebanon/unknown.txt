Leaving work, walking across the parking lot, I looked up at the sky as usual.  I saw an amber colored, round light.  I heard no sound.  First I thought it was a far off plane coming in for a landing.         (Lebanon Airport is on a hill right behind my job site) then this light faded as another came on.  This was in a straight line, so I thought the plane was banking and I was seeing the other wing.  Then another light came on at the same rate as the second one faded, still in this straight line, at about a 35 degree angle to horizon from right to left.   still no sound.  I realized this was not a plane.  They were not flares being dropped.  Flares don't remain stationary. Since it was dark, and the lights of the parking lot were on, I couldn't see a craft.   The lights repeated this pattern at least 6 times.  I am not sure how far away these lights were from my position, but they were low in the sky. I stopped a coworker to show him just before the display ended.   He was as baffled as I was.  We could hear a plane take off from the airport.  It flew over us at this time.  There was still no sound coming from the direction of the lights. I got into my car and drove out of the parking lot and onto the highway as fast as I legally could.  I wanted to get away from the parking lot lights.  Looking in the direction the lights were, I saw nothing unusual,  just stars, the sky was clear.;43.6448;-72.2971
