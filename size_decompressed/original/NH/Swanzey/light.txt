I was out walking my dog as I do every night.   As I looked up over the tall pines lining a field by my house I saw an object about the size of a large star emitting an orange color come out of nowhere, sit there for a split second and than started zig zagging upwards fast before it disappeared.   I heard no noise coming from it and I continued to search the sky for a few moments afterwards but saw nothing else.   So being easily freaked out decided to take the dog home for the night.;42.8411;-72.3301
