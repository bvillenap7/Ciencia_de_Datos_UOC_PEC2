Strange silver sphere over Swanzey,NH;2008-05-27 20:30:00;20 minutes;Strange silver sphere over Swanzey,NH I was getting ready to observe Saturn at approximately 20:30 hours on 5/27/08, with my Takahashi FS 102 refractor when I noticed a funny ''star'' in the vicinity of Leo.I could not yet see other stars in the sky as it was not quite dark enough.As I slewed my scope to the object,that was not listed on any of my charts,I immediately noticed that this was nothing that I've ever witnessed,(Been an avid amateur astronomer for 22 years!)It was silver in appearance,with odd dark grey shadings and funny reflective lights seemed to omit from it.There was also a small point of light that was circling the sphere in oblong  irregular patterns.It was completely stationary,I know because the sidereal tracking was turned on on my mount and I had to compensate for it.It remained there for approximately 10-20 minutes.My girlfriend,who was with me also witnessed the ''event''.It then suddenly just disappeared into the sky.;42.8411;-72.3301
