Three white lights seen over I-91 in Springfield, NH;2010-12-11 19:00:00;2 minutes;Three white lights seen over I-91 in Springfield, NH At around 7:00 on December 11th, 2010, a couple girlfriends and I were on our way to a concert in Bellows Falls.  As we drove down I-91 South I noticed a trio of lights far in the distance. I told them to look at what was ahead, and we all found it strange.  At a first glance it looked like stadium lights, but then I realized there were no stadiums anywhere near the highway and this object was floating. As we continued to drive and watch this object, it came closer and closer very quickly. This was strange as it seemed so far away.  It was very dark outside so the color of the object was not seen. The lights were white and flickered very slightly.  Before I could get a picture of it the object flew over the trees to the right of us and out of our sight.;43.4901;-72.0448
