June 20, 2013 9:50-10pm (22:00).  Canterbury, New Hampshire.  My boyfriend and myself were in our back yard admiring fire flies, this is when we walked over to a path we have leading to our chicken coop my boyfriend noticed in the sky what he thought to be planes.  About 100 feet from where we stood we saw 3 red bright lights round in shape.  There were two red lights that were clearly separate objects following closely to a much larger object. It flew closer approximately 50 feet above us very fast.  When it was above the tree tops we could see them in an opening of the trees.  I saw a triangular shaped flying object with a haze around it very large in size with red lights, two separate objects trailing behind it, both were red lights moving in their own paths.  The two red lights were flying behind it never beside it.  The 3 objects hovered slowly over the tree tops towards the north silently as they flew over our pond we could not see them because of the trees.  This is my account.;43.3569;-71.5625
