Blue-Green Object Streaking Through the Sky;2013-09-22 19:20:00;3-5 seconds;Blue-Green Object Streaking Through the Sky I just saw an Unidentified Flying Object in the truest sense of the word.   At appx. 720pm over the vegetable garden of the farm in Canterbury, NH an object heading west began to glow bright blue-green while moving at the speed slightly slower then a descending meteor.  It might have been a few thousand feet high, but was certainly not as high as when planes fly at higher altitudes of 20,000 - 30,000 feet.  While I have int mind it was a metallic object crashing, there is one peculiarity.   I spend a lot of time outside and see a lot of meteors. I have yet to see one which brightens, dims and brightens again during decsent.  Likewise I have never seen one glow blue-green during descent.  Within the appx. 3 seconds I saw this object it glowed blue-green then dimmed then brightened up again.  It appeared to slow down each time while glowing which makes sense do to speed and atmospheric resistance.  The trees west blocked the rest of the view but I could see through the ! lower portion and was looking for a crash because the object was quite large and fast.  I did not see the object go lower.;43.3569;-71.5625
