Orange light in the sky.;2015-04-11 02:17:00;3 seconds;Orange light in the sky On April 11 at 2:17 am my girlfriend and I were driving to work on I-93 South in NH near the Canterbury Exit.   We both saw an orange light traveling through the southwest sky from right to left diagonally towards the horizon.  The light was dark orange in color and did not have a tail.  It travelled for approximately 3 seconds and then disappeared.  It travelled fast than a satellite but slower than a meteor and did not appear to fizzle out, it just disappeared.;43.3569;-71.5625
