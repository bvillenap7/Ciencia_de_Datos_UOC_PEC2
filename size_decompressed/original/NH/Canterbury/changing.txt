Sighted very bright clear ball, moon shaped, with red & green circles around it.  Visable to the naked eye .  Picked up binoculars, through them the orb, took on a horseshoe shape with beams of red lights shooting down.  Shape appeared almost translucent, or 3-D.  Watched with binoculars for about 5 minutes, shape would almost flatten out and change into squares, upon examining with a telescope, the shape  was a large orb broke off into three triangles, all still within the orb.  Than formed the ball again, than broke off into 3 circles, began to move rapidly within the orb, with very bright red and green lights surrounding them, this   continued for about 3-5 minutes, than merged again to the large orb.  At times with the eye this appeared to be like a giant ferris wheel moving around with all the colors.  This orb could change shapes, and appeared almost translucent, yet when I viewed through it, I saw bright glowing lights.  It moved out of view for a few seconds, and when it reappeared, it was not as bright, the light was clear, of halogen quality.  after 30 minutes it finally went behind the hill.  The sky was crystal clear, I began to see this at dusk, and continued until well after dark.  the sky above the orb was brightly lit, it is amazing it was not viewed by others.;43.3569;-71.5625
