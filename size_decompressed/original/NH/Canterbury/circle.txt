I CAME HOME AFTER WORK AND PULLED UP TO MY DRIVE WAY AND SAW A LARGE ROUND OBJECT THAT WAS A ORANGE REDDISH IN COLOR BUT NOT GLOWING OUTWARD, BUT SOLID IN COLOR I STOPPED MY TRUCK COULDN'T BELIEVE I WAS SEEING SO I FLASHED MY HIGH BEAMS TO GET ATTENTION NOTHING HAPPENED SO I SHUT OFF MY TRUCK TO LISTEN FOR NOISE. NO NOISE! THE LARGE OBJECT WAS MOVING IN BETWEEN THE VALLY AT SLOW SPEED HEADING SOUTH TO SOUTHEAST AND THEN RACED DOWN MY DRIVE WAY TO PARK AND RAN TO A EMBANKEMENT AND WATCH IT GO SOUTH EAST AND IT APPEARED TO GO LITTLE FASTER HAS GOES THROUGH THE HILLS OUT OF SIGHT! THE BEST RECULATION THE I GOT WAS BIGGER THEN MY FARM HOUSE BUT IT WAS VERY DARK OUTSIDE I'M GUESSING IT WAS OVER CAST THAT NIGHT. I WENT TO WORK THE NEXT DAY 3:30 IN THE AFTERNOON TOLD THE GUYS WHAT I SAW, THE GUYS THOUGHT I WAS WHACKED IN THE HEAD! I WAS IN THE MILITARY FOR AWHILE  BEFORE I GOT MEDICAL DISCHARGE!
