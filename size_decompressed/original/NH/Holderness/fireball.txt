Delivering newspapers in the Mt. Prospect area of Holderness, I glimpsed a large greenish/blue fireball @0315.  What surprised me the most was the rate of speed, much slower than a meteorite.  This must have been due to being much closer to the earth.  In relative size it appeared to be 1/2 the size of the moon.   My first encounter with a fireball was on 2/15 @ 0515 hrs. on Rte. 113 in Holderness.  This fireball seemed much closer and was white in color.  I had never seen a fireball before and was quite astonished at the size and slow rate of speed.  It appeared to be very low, almost directly overhead.  The following night I glimpsed another at a much greater height.;43.7378;-71.6044
