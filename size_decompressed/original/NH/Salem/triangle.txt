We both thought it was a helicopter covering a story of some sort as it was hovering and not moving. As we got closer and almost underneath I saw that the lights were not spot lights and that there were clearly 3 lights ( one on each corner) and 1 slowly blinking red light in the center.  We could clearly see the outline of the craft and i would guess that it was at least 60-80 ft from point to point.  We were close enough to realize that it was making no noise.  It slowly hovered to the south and then to the west maybe 600 feet to the west of rt 28.  We drove in to Walmart parking lot as a Police car was speeding out in the same direction towards the craft.  We quickly parked and got out of the car to watch it and it was gone.;42.7811000000001;-71.2155999999998

It was so  brite it could not figure out what it was.  It was just hovering and then it moved what seemed about a few mile in just a few second.  It was in the shape of a triangle ..I dont know what it was ...  But i Do know it was not a helicopter or a airplane..  It was very huge it did not make any sound..;42.7811000000001;-71.2155999999998
