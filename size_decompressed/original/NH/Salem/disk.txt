As i was lying there with my face looking upwards to the beautiful blue sky.  i noticed a metal object falling from the sky. There was three other people with me. And I told them to look at that thing falling from the sky.  They couldn't see it. So i made them lay on the car where i was located, and pointed there head to the object. then I told them to keep looking straight up till you see what i see.  They found the object too.  At that time it appeared the object stop in its falling.  And hovered there for a long time.  Eventually all four of us was watching this object flash on and off.  The three of them sat there for over four hours total. Then all of a sudden, all three of them started moving northwards I was located in Salem, New Hampshire, at that time.  They started moving very slowly and started to go faster, and then short into space very quickly. I couldn't stop looking up for the rest of the day.  Then i notice from the Southeast another object coming but this one was totally lite up.  It went to the same place the other three object where sitting for three to four hours. Sat there for less then a minute.  Then it headed off in the same flight path the other three went. this one must of hit its boosters because it took off very fast and was out of sight in one second heading north. Then a fifth object came from the west to the same location. and did the same as the forth. sat there for a few minutes and blasted off towards the north in the same direction. it went so fast i could only see its burners as it moved northwardsâ€¦ ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
