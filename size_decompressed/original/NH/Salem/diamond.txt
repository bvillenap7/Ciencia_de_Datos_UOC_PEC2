I stepped out onto my deck at about 6:30 am and immediately noticed a very bright light in the sky.  At first, I thought it was probably an airplane, but it did not appear to be moving. The object appeared MUCH bigger (at least 5 times) than any of the stars in the sky and VERY bright. I thought I could see a 2 blinking red lights on the bottom, but not sure.  I went back inside to get my binoculars but was unable to get better resolution through them.  I walked downstairs to the back yard and watched the object for another couple minutes.  The light seemed to fade slightly, as if a haze passed over and brightened again.  In about 30 seconds it was completely gone.;42.7811000000001;-71.2155999999998
