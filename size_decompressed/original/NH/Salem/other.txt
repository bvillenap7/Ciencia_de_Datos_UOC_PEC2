An unusually high number of airplanes traveling one after the other from Northeast NH to Southwest MA;2020-02-15 12:10:00;20 minutes;An unusually high number of airplanes traveling one after the other from Northeast NH to Southwest MA On February 15, 2020, shortly after noon, I was driving West along Rte 111 in the Salem N.H. area just before Rte 93 when I noticed to my left that there were several large airplanes, presumably passenger planes, one following another at what appeared to be the usual traveling altitude (? 30K ft)  I thought it odd that there were so many airplanes traveling in the same direction, same altitude, all somewhat equally distanced from each other.  I took a couple of pretty bad pictures with my cell phone which mostly just showed the contrails of each.  I then continued on my way to take Rte 93 south.  After I got on Rte 93 I saw that there were many more aircraft, as I described previously.  I stopped counting at 32.  These planes were travelling from Northeast NH to Southwest Massachusetts, as far as I could tell. Nothing unusual about appearance except for the sheer number of them.  Not knowing how to research a happening like this, I asked family and friends on FB if anyone had witnessed this. No one claimed to see what I had seen.
