Metallic object reflecting the Sun, then vanishes.;2013-10-20 08:10:00;10 seconds;Metallic object reflecting the Sun, then vanishes. I was traveling on I-93S around Salem at 8:10 am on 10/20/13.  In the center of my windshield, above the horizon,  I see a metallic sphere or cylinder reflecting the Sun at approx. 15,000-25,000 ft.  As I’m trying to identify object as a plane, it disappears in thin air.   The sky was totally clear.  The Sun was at 10 o’clock and the object was at 12 o’clock.  Very interesting indeed… ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.7811000000001;-71.2155999999998
