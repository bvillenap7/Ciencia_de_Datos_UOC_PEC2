While going for a walk on Wheeler dam off of north main street in Salem.  My friend and I were looking at the stars when we stay 2 balls of light just above the atmosphere flying from the direction of Arlington pond.   At first I thought the balls of light could have been a couple satellites.  Which is very common to see at night when star gazing. Both object disappeared once they reached a certain point in the sky.   Suddenly as both balls of light disappeared we noticed a 3rd light approaching from the Haverhill Ma direction.  This ball of light disappeared when it reached the same location in the sky.  All the objects reached the same point in the sky within about 10-15 seconds of each other.  As we stood in disbelief we noticed that the point in the sky where the objects disappeared seemed to black out other stars.  We noticed a circler type black spot in the sky.  Then we noticed the dark spot slowly fade out revealing the stars behind it.   After the whole incident ended we noticed a very unusually amount of small engine aircraft in the area.  Just small planes,  No helicopters.  We counted 5 planes total.  Which is also unusual for this particular area. (3) balls of light and (1) dark circle in the sky that blocked out stars. for a total of what I would consider to be (4) objects.;42.7811000000001;-71.2155999999998
Light High.;2015-07-31 21:56:00;15 seconds;Light High I observed a single light, very high in the sky, without any blinking lights.  It was traveling north from south. The speed was faster than a jet but not as fast as the ISS.   While viewing it, still it disappeared while I still had a clear view of it.  It did not blink out-simply just disappeared. No regular aircraft travel this route or follow any flight plans such as this.  I did observe a small aircraft traveling west to east just after my sighting.;42.7811000000001;-71.2155999999998
Bright ball of light over Salem, NH 2 witnesses.;2016-02-18 18:10:00;4 minutes;Bright ball of light over Salem, NH 2 witnesses. I was walking up my driveway whilst taking up the trash barrels with my friend and we witnessed an extremely bright ball of light suddenly flying southwest over my home in Salem.  We both stopped dead in our tracks and I scrambled for my cellphone to take video.   Typically if I see a plane or a satellite, I don't bother even looking for more than a moment as they are very common in my area.  However once what i thought to be a satellite at first slowed down then stopped I had to take a closer look.  Just as i began recording the video the object starting moving as if it never stopped.   There were several small aircraft in the night sky and they're were on their normal flight paths.  It was clear and there were many stars.  Just as the main object started to fade in the distance the object which was just a brilliant white ball of light disappeared over methuen ma just a few miles in the distance but not before a smaller and less luminous object appeared directly above me and my friend.   This object flew quickly over head and was heading south of Salem.  I've seen simular objects before mostly satellites, however these objects were not characteristic of a satellite or high altitude aircraft.  I've been an observer for 18 years and wouldn't report anything that i felt was typical.   After the second object appeared it faded off into the distance.  I checked this site to see if anyone else had any sightings in New Hampshire and they did.  Not exactly  the same as what i saw but ufos have a funny way of changing their appearance.  So their sighting may or may not be related to mine.  Here is a link to the video taken that evening.  I hope it helps: https://youtu.be/g_eCM9OErdo ((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the video, and it shows a white speck of light, moving around the Moon, in the night sky.  We are not convinced that it is an authentic UFO.  PD));42.7811000000001;-71.2155999999998

I did not see any solid shape, just an red/orange ball of light.  I thought it was a headlight of a plane but it was too big. It was about how high a plane is in the sky. I have not told anyone.  I don't want to get teased, but I know it was odd.;42.7811000000001;-71.2155999999998
I noticed this bright blue light the lit up the sky.  Seconds right after it happens again.  ((anonymous report));2017-11-06 18:25:00;1 minute;I was leaving from the Rockingham Mall in Salem NH to head back to MA.  So I took the highway back home.  As soon I start merging to the highway, I noticed this bright blue light the lit up the sky.  Seconds right after it happens again.  I’ve seen this happen multiple time from the same direction and it always happened when it’s dark and cloudy.   I’ve passed by during the day, but you can’t see nothing that will light up the sky blue. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
