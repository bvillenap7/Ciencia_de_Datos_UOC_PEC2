Bright Red Object Dodging 2 Military Jets!;2012-12-12 23:00:00;5 minutes;Bright Red Object Dodging 2 Military Jets! We heard a(loud roaring)noise coming from outside,  My husband and I jumped up and went outside to see what it was, my husband continued outside as I ran back to get a video camera(which was of no use battery was dead)  But the (loud) roaring noise was 2 military jets going over our house,  1 was going west to east and the other jet was going east to west, by the time I got back out I saw the jets passing by each other going in opposing directions, at this point I was facing west and there was a bright red lighted object appeared to make no noise or if it did miiltary jets dronned out the noise,It was hard to tell the shape because of brightness of light, I would say saucer shape and my husband says circle, this object looked as if it was going to crash,  It appeared to be going down at a fast rate, by that time the military jet that was going east turned back west,this object then, suddenly excellerated back up and veered westerly,   We were watching it trying to! figure out what the h. was going on as it was moving at one point I noted a bluish green streak at the Top left hand corner of the object, It then appeared to go North until we could no longer have it in view and the military jets went off after it into the distance.   When we first saw the jets and the object we were thinking this object must be a plane in trouble or something it's going to crash, but when we saw the manuvers and the rate this object moved not to mention the dodging of the military planes this object appeared to do! We are shaking our heads saying what did we just see?  What were those military Jets doing with this object...Looked and felt like a UFO chase to us???????;43.3001;-71.8326
