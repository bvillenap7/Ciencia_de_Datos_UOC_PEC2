The single light was pinpointed,such as a distant star and white, and travelling from the North/North East toward the South/Southwest at a slow but steady unaltered speed.The sky was completely clear with no overcast. After viewing it for about 10 or 11 seconds, it abruptly reversed its' direction but on an angle approx. 30 degrees from where I first noticed it. It did not stop or appear to slow down in any way upon changing direction.  Recently, I have viewed this same phenomenon documented on television, (shown 3/24/00 on FOX network). This was exactly, without any deviation, the same type UFO that I witnessed that night.  The one that was documented was filmed from a satellite in 1991.  I am convinced this was not from ice,debris or any man made product and in fact it was a visitation from an alien spacecraft. I have viewed satellites before at night and have never seen them change direction.;43.7094;-71.4823
Lights hovering over Lake Winnipesaukee;2020-10-02 18:45:00;15 minutes;Lights hovering over Lake Winnipesaukee I was eating dinner in my car at Center Harbor town docks on the Shore of Lake Winnipesaukee.  I noticed an object consisting to two horozontal bright lights hovering over the lake about a mile from me.  With binoculars I could see no real form and it had no blinking lights as helicopters have.  It hovered about a hundred feet above the lake.  Then it rose up slightly and nthen moved to the right in a westerly direction, passing behind some trees.;43.7094;-71.4823
