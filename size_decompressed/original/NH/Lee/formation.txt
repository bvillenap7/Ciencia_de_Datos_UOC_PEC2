While walking outside with my wife I noticed what I thought was helicopter drone.  At first, I thought the lights were rotors.  However, they were not stationary.  It was a long gray cigar with 2 thin bright white cylindrical objects similar to a florescent light moving with it. So, I deduced that it was a KC-135 Tanker with two fighter jets.  I attempted to put wings on it and count engines, it had none.  The whole time I am trying to make sense of what i was seeing the “fighter jets” were moving very quickly and erratically all over and around this thing. I was only able to observe it for about ten seconds as it was moving very fast with no contrail like all the other planes had at the time.;43.1165;-71.0009
