Looking NW a bright white ball like light appeared in clear sky still a mostly light outside.   Around dusk. Was probably as a high a commercial planes fly but below the clouds.  How long it was there before we saw it was no more than a few minutes.  We all saw it and freaked out because it was clearly a UFO. Not a craft any of us had known to exist.  For some reason we think it knew we saw it because we signaled it with headlights and lighters and waving and yelling from car in open wooded area and it blinked once, maybe twice.   We couldnt believe it and after a minute it blinked again and cut the distance in half within a second and was probaly a couple miles from us as opposed to 5.  Maybe more, hard to tell distance.  Don't know how far eye can see.  But definatley was 50% closer to us.  We were shocked and we wouldn't take our eyes off it.   It soon dissapeared.  And so did we.  Started car and got the out of there.   What we didn't think of at that time, but later on was maybe it was right above us that last time.  Didn't take time ot look.  The area is near a AF Station.  Proabaly 20 miles away.;43.0714;-71.7038
