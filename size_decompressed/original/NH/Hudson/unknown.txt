When I went outside to start my car, I heard the sound of a motor..like that of a huge fan on top of a building. I noticed a cloud in southern sky and I saw a blinking light. I then saw several brights lights blinking at random..like several fireflies. This went on for several minutes in the same spot. When the noise subsided, the blinking lights moved toward the horizon and disappeared. I have to add...I never believed a UFO story..I'm 54 yrs old. please eamil correspondence.;42.7668;-71.4082
