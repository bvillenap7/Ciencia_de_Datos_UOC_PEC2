My older brother and three friends and I were coming back from sledding at the whip-poor-will golf course behind our housing development, whip-poor-will estates.  As we were walking a circular object rose from the tree line and abruptly stopped at a few hundred feet high.  The object was semi-transparent and glowing a white to blue color.   We all froze in our paths.  The sky was overcast and snow was on the ground.  The object hovered for a few seconds then suddenly accelerated and streaked over our heads at an incredible speed leaving a light trail and disappeared thru the cloud cover. Instantaneously we all looked at each other and said”did you see that?”  After the shock waned we talked and decided not to call the police for fear of ridicule.   A few months later I saw a similar object from my bedroom window toward the same wooded area.  This event has been on my mind my throughout my adult life.
