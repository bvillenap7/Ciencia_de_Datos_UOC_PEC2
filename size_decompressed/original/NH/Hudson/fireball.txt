Fireball in the sky!;2013-09-24 21:30:00;5 minutes;Fireball in the sky! My friend was out in his driveway talking to his buddy at around 9:30pm. Something caught his attention in the corner of his eye… It was something bright and fiery coming up out of the trees.  It had to only be a couple blocks away. They were both very confused as to what it could be. It looked to be the size of a beach ball… but was bright and fiery.  He immediately pulled out his phone and started to record.  At first it looked as though it was just floating up, but then it started moving and zipping around in all different directions very quickly. It kept getting higher and was hard to keep recording it because it was moving so quickly.  Eventually an airplane was crossing through the sky and this fiery ball seemed to be above it. It ended up going higher and higher until it disappeared. When I got there to his house he told me the whole story and showed me the video. We are both pretty sane, smart people and are definitely a little freaked out by this. I! have never seen anything like this before, and can’t think of any reasonable explanation of what it was.;42.7668;-71.4082
