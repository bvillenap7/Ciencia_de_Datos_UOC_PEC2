One triangle shaped object flying low at a very slow speed and was very quiet, no engine noise heard.   Dark gray in color with red lights on each of the 3 tips.   Upon approach higher in the sky and distance, it was a ball of white light and as it got closer, it appeared like very bright headlights.   It passed over the road about 50 feet up and hovered over the trees for a few seconds and then slowly went to the west.;42.7668;-71.4082

I have never seen this before.  as I yelled what the heck is that and go to grab my phone to take a video.  that's when it flew fast in front of me. I was able to catch just a glimce of the fast object needed to speed up in my vehicle.  it was super fast, I know what I saw and not many believe me or they believe it to be a police drone. I know what a drone looks like. this was no drone.  I have video footage which I edited to be seen in slow motion because everything happened so fast. it was triangler with lights at the bottom it flashed or blinked every few seconds. it's was silver greyish looking. it was also very silent made no noises at all.;42.7668;-71.4082
