It was a silver colored object, clearly & obviously Not a plane. I was entering route 111 in hudson when the sighting Occurred. It wasn't moving. It was an incredible experience.  The object began to descend.  It appeared to be rotating. It was perfectly still in the sky which was very clear at the time. It was witnessed by me & my girlfriend. As we proceeded, the object ( as large as it was) just vanished;42.7668;-71.4082
