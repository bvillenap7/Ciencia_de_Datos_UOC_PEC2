White light without noise to go with it;2009-09-20 01:00:00;10 sec;White light without noise to go with it I was standing in my back yard looking at the stars around 1am on 9/20/09 when without warning a white light started to light the trees in the farthest part of my yard and proceeded to sweep down towards me. It lit the inside of my yard, against the trees on both sides so I knew it wasn’t coming from the neighbors’ house or the woods. It proceeded to me, lit up where I was standing and went up and lit up my house. At that point everything was as bright as a football stadium. Just as fast, the light went out and I could see the stars again. I live on a flight path for Manchester Airport and when the light started, I was expecting to hear jet engines, but when the light went out, all was quiet. Not even a cricket.;42.7668;-71.4082

Very white bright light moving fast inside clouds.;2013-10-10 21:30:00;1 second;Very white bright light moving fast inside clouds. My brother and I were driving directly east.  Alto-cumulus cover clouds, 21:30, or 9:30pm.   Saw a very white bright light moving north very fast, while inside the cloud cover.  Faster than plane, jet, ISS, slower than meteorite.  Very shocking.   Another one of my friends told me she saw the same light at the same time also in Hudson.;42.7668;-71.4082
