The closer it came we noticed 3 white lights and a small red  light were on the ufo shaped like a triangle.   I was driving, but my friend noticed faint lights connecting all three triangles.  We stopped the car curiously as it flew over, soon after my friend watched it disappear into thin air.   It was cloudy tonight,not being able to see stars or any other planes, so it had to be low.  A minute after it disappeared it reappeared where we first saw it. Then after that we lost it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
