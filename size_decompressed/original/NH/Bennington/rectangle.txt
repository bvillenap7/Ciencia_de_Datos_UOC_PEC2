Route 37 heading from Bennington to Frances town.;2017-12-04 04:40:00;1 minute;Route 37 heading from Bennington to Frances town. Husband was fueling up his truck before starting his day when a “large” shape past overhead. Larger than our house, seemed to have wings straight up with lights on top of them.   White light at end and orange like lights on the bottom.  It was about 500 ft. about the trees and again NO noise. He has been haunted by it every day since and will not speak to anyone. It continued towards the mounting. No one else saw this?;43.011;-71.9062
