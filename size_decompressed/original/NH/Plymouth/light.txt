On Monday morning, approximately 12:30 AM, I was sitting on my deck outside.  The night was warm and clear. I was stargazing as I like to do.  There was a red flashing light in a clearing above the mountains. We frequently see high, transatlantic air traffic. And being an Air Force brat I always enjoy the light speed is faster than sound speed phenomena. So when I see a high aircraft I like to watch it before I hear the sound.  Although, this was different. I could hear something. It was familiar.  And as I was looking up to see if I had missed an aircraft passing over (because of the sound I was hearing), I saw the red light. I looked like it was heading in the direction (although very high) of where I was observing it. But each time it blinked it seemed to be getting much closer very quickly. Faster than even some of the military jets we see up here that do exercises.  Then, after about 3 or 4 blinks it veered 90 degrees to the east and went so fast that it literally appeared to be just a streak in the sky. It was nearly like a shooting star. I've seen plenty of shooting stars and satellites.  I sat still for about 10 minutes trying to digest what I had just seen. Came in, drew a picture. And after talking to some people at work yesterday who have seen similar things, I found this web site.  So, I suppose this is a report. I'm still in awe of what I saw. I was afraid to outside last night though for a second look. :-);43.7574;-71.6881000000001

Then another smaller object came straight toward it, moved in a quarter circular motion above it.  Next the second one moved straight up then disappeared momentarily and re appears far to the left.  The whole time the first light is rapidly moving away still at a very low to ground height.recorded the entire thing.;43.7574;-71.6881000000001
