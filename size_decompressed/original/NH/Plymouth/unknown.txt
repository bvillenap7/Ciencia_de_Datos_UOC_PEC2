The two lights could be one very large craft or two smaller crafts. The lights did not orbit each other but drifted at the same rate and direction. A low satellite passed over head then about 30 seconds later we viewed the object.  The object crossed over the path of the previously mentioned satellites flight path.  The intersect of the satellites flight path and the object flight path was between 32 degrees - 40 degrees.  The object was at a very high altitude.  It is possible the object was at a higher altitude to the satellite.  I continued to watch it until it was out of my range of sight. I lost visibility as it passed the constellation Orion.  The two lights maintained speed and distance the entire time.  No hull of a craft was seen, just the lights.  The object was at to high of an altitude.;43.7574;-71.6881000000001
