Three witnesses see multiple UFO sightings over the Plymouth, NH area.;2005-03-04 20:00:00;10 min.;Three witnesses see multiple UFO sightings over the Plymouth, NH area. We were to exit 23 off I-93 North heading home to Bristol, NH when in the sky (to high for street lights) were there were six or seven teardrop shaped lights flashing off and on with and orange-peach colored glow in a sequetial pattern but they were all over the section of the sky in front of us.  I almost made my wife pull over on the off ramp to observe, but we continued until we found a safe place, but the view was obscured so we moved to another area all the times with the lights flashing.  We have never seen anything like this before also my car radar detector was going haywire, I reset it only to have it freak out again.   We finally found a place to view them at the New Hampton Fire department when the lights lined up then disappeared leaving only a star in their place.  We then jumped back onto I-93 N. to track where they went, followed all the way to Plymouth but they were gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
