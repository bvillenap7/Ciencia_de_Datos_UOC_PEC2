There was a very large and bright object in the sky straight ahead of us (west).  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus.  PD));2017-03-04 19:20:00;unsure;Driving west on Route 25 Tenney Mountain Highway.  There was a very large and bright object in the sky straight ahead of us (west).  We could not tell if it was a planet, but it was pulsating.  It was not flickering as a star would.  We pulled into Hannaford Supermarket parking lot and it now appeared in south west sky.  We watched it for 5 minutes.  Then, I noticed a car pulling over also looking at the object.  It was very cold out so we went into the supermarket.  When we came back out about 15 minutes later, it was no longer present in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus.  PD));43.7574;-71.6881000000001
