Turning in that direction, I saw an object drifting over the road to my left.  It was basically cigar shaped with a small asymmetrical wing on one side. The flashing light was at the end of this wing.   One end of the craft glowed with a red light. The other end appeared to have 3 panels attached to the bottom of it.  The center panel had 2 white lights illuminated the outer 2 panels had 3 green lights illuminated.   The object seemed close enough to hit if you stood on the roof of the 2 story building under it and fired a roman candle straight up.   It appeared to be moving with intend but at a slow speed.  It was completely silent.   My view was obstructed by trees before the craft changed direction or speed or anything.;43.7574;-71.6881000000001
