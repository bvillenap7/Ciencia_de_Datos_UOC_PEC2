strange light with reflection on water.;2003-09-04 06:00:00;unsure;strange light with reflection on water. I took this photo on a very quiet morning in September, I believe.  You can clearly see a light, with a reflection in the water of Crystal Lake on the left hand side of the picture.  I did not notice it until I took a look at the developed photo. I have the negative.  I feel it is worth looking into since there is the reflection.  I am sending you the picture with this report.  However, the actual photo shows it much more clearly that on my computer screen.  Let me know if you would like the negative. Sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  The date is approximate.  We have viewed the photograph, provided by the witness, and it shows a bright, yellow object, suspended above a cloud of mist rising off a still pond.  The object is also reflected off the surface of the pond, so we suspect it is not the result of a lens flare.  We do not know what the object is, but it does not look to be larger in width than a meter, and we suspect it is not a bona fide UFO.  PD));43.4175;-71.4121
