I was driving south on route 10, just outside of the village of Woodsville, in the town of Haverhill, New Hampshire at 2205 on Friday, April 15 of this year.  I noted a green teardrop shaped light, with an orange glow around it, traveling due west over the Grafton County Complex then over the Connecticut River into Vermont.  The light seemed to be a couple of hundred feet up in the air, and was moving in a straight line. The shape of the light did not change shape, there was no noise, and the body of the light had a brilliant green color like that of a Granny Smith apple.  The orange color outlining this green light was thin and the hue of embers you would see in your fireplace.  I couldn't make out any solid object as it seemed to be pure light.  The light did not affect the electrical system of my car, nor did I feel any different while witnessing it.;44.154;-72.0375
