Circular Yellow and Green object in 2 photos taken on after the other.;2019-10-13 08:00:00;4 seconds;Circular Yellow and Green object in 2 photos taken on after the other. I was reviewing my photos that I took on the morning of October 13th, 2019 at 08:00 in North Conway, New Hampshire during the sunrise and I found what looks like a circular object that glowed yellow and green color and came from the sky and down towards the ground and then disappeared. I have two shots that seem to show it moving downward from the top right to the center of my next photo and then gone on the next shot. Sending 2 untouched photos.;44.0677;-71.0731999999999
I saw at least 12 glowing orbs in perfect formation traveling diagonally.

When I looked up in the nighttime sky, I saw at least 12 glowing orbs in perfect formation traveling diagonally downward from the left of the sky going down to the right.  Going a steady, fast speed in perfect formation, evenly spaced apart from one another.Then they disappeared behind the mountain.;44.0677;-71.0731999999999
