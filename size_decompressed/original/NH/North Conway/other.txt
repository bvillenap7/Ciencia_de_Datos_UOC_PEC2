Moving Stars in Cetral New Hampshire Mountain Range;2001-05-22 20:50:00;6-10 seconds;Moving Stars in Cetral New Hampshire Mountain Range While standing on my aunt's back porch which looks across to North Moat Mtn. (elev.3195 ft. & part of the White Mountain National Forest), in North Conway, NH, I was gazing several miles out at the remainder of light from the dusk sky. At best guess, I'd say between 700-1000 feet above the highest peek and perfectly aligned with the horizon, one bright, star-like light/size appeared from no where. The first light split into a second identical light and quickly moved horizontaly southward leaving a very faint and momentary light stream behind it. It moved about 300ft to the left of the still lit, first light and came to a complete and sudden stop. At this point, the second light did the exact same thing as the first (eg: same split, same size, same light trail, same distance, same sudden stop) leaving three identical lights above the mountain for about three seconds. Then, once in position the first light dissapeared (much like someone switching off a light), followed by the second, and then the third. Since there was still enough dusk light in the sky, I scanned the sky for the silouet of a plane, a glider or anything that might have given off such a light.......the sky was perfectly clear, with the exeption of a few faint stars just beginning to appear.
