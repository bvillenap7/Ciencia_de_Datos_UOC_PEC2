Lighted Craft above tree line;2013-11-14 17:00:00;10 seconds;Lighted Craft above tree line UFO Sighting in North Conway, NH While Driving past the Muddy Moose up in the sky. Orange lights in the sky right above the tree line grabbed my attention. I was driving so had to keep looking back at the road.  I'm not sure if it was one craft or 6-10 single crafts in unison.  At first it looked like 2 lines parallel to each other diagonally, about 4 lights on the bottom and 3 above it then one above that.  I stared for probably 5 seconds then all the sudden it was gone then 3 lights appeared.  It disappeared again then i could only see one light. There were no clouds in the sky, just seemed like a layer of cloud and fog that this UFO was leveled right between, and what i was seeing was it breaking through then moving back up.  The way it moved was magestical.  I remeber feeling like i knew what it was, i knew it was no human craft, it was flying so low, and so peacfully still as it turned.;44.0677;-71.0731999999999
