At first glance, I thought I was looking at a plane. Upon further inspection, I noticed that what I saw was not shaped like a plane, but more like a cylinder with a smaller cylinder attached. It was extremely loud, and had a few colored lights blinking on it, I believe they were green and red. It also had a huge spotlight pointing down.  The color of the spotlight was very white and extremely bright, but did not appear to be looking for anything specific, especially at the speed it was flying.  It seemed to be flying to the north, and then when I thought it was out of sight, I heard the sound of it retuning, at which point I went indoors.  I was afraid.;44.0677;-71.0731999999999
