Large ball of white light that appeared to land.;2007-07-11 02:00:00;10 seconds;Large ball of white light that appeared to land. I awoke this morning and felt startled however, there was no noise or reason for feeling this way.  Looking out over the pine trees in my back field I saw a large beach ball type object brightly lit with a few darker patchy areas.  I had an excellent view as we have a sliding door in the bedroom and the curtain was pulled open with the door slightly ajar as well. The object was not moving in a regular smooth path, sort of hovering but going up and down with the whole object's lights going off and on at the same time, guessing I would say it was moving up and down a about 30 to 50 feet erratically, then suddenly it moved left and went straight down, totally silent.  For a brief moment the distant field appeared to light up, then darkness as if it was never there.  I immediately looked at the time and it was a few minutes before 2:00AM;43.4088;-71.7022
