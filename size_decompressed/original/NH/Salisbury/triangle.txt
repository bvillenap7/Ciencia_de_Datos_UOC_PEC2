We got up and went out on the balcony and clearly saw two lights rise up from behind the trees in the field behind our house (about 1500 feet away from our home).  When they reached the treetops, one light flew off to the southeast and the other one, which we could see from a better angle, produced two side lights (to form a triangle) and flew off to the southwest, about 150 feet over our house.  We estimate the speed to about 300 MPH.  We woke up our eldest son to witness it also.;43.4088;-71.7022
Second sighting in the same area.;2008-10-29 22:14:00;3 Minutes;Second sighting in the same area. Once again, I was lying in bed watching TV and I saw a single light in the field behind my house. I woke my husband and I went out on the balcony. My three boys were downstairs and also saw the light and came up to our room. The light rose out of the field and two more lights became visible in the shape of a triangle. There were some smaller red flashing lights right close to the first light. There was also a beam of light projecting across the sky in the direction the object was flying. It proceeded to fly over our house heading south. As it went over, we heard a low rumbling sound. This is the second time we have seen this craft.;43.4088;-71.7022
