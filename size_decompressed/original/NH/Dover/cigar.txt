NH.  I have seen them before like 12 years ago.  But this time I had a friend with me that didn't believe is ufos.  Until that day.   We both saw a sliver cigar shape craft.  It had no wings nothing. It wasn't very high in the sky. And right when it was out of are sight.  And fuel carrier plane came over us goi g to pease Air Force base. The ufo was completely silent.   I bring my ipad with me to recorded us shooting.  Well one time I forgot it on the roof of my friends car.  So because of that. The one day we go shooting I said I'm gonna leave this ipad at home just in case.  And look what happens to me that day I saw a ufo. I could see it crystal clear.
