UFO accompanied by strange weather in Dover New Hampshire;2020-04-14 02:16:00;5 minutes;UFO accompanied by strange weather in Dover New Hampshire It was 2:14, I was laying in bed. I felt a strange urge to look out the living room window , so I got up and went to the window .  I opened the curtain , and the first place I looked there was a flying craft that looked like a line of red lights hovering ,about 5 miles away and just above the treeline.  I continued to look at it as many of the red lights began to brighten . The craft continued to move further away .  The red lights dimmed and became a singular white light, which became very bright momentarily,then quickly faded to a point where I could see nothing .  The weather is absurd this morning .  After a day of thick, heavy rainfall, the skies are completely clear and there is an unnatural, very fast wind blowing in one direction .;43.1888949999999;-70.8865862500001
