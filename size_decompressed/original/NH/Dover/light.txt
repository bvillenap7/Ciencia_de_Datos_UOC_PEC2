Bright red slow moving lights;2012-08-30 23:00:00;3 minutes;Bright red slow moving lights We looked up and saw a triangle shape of bright red, non blinking lights moving slowly across the sky. We couldnt hear any noise coming from them.   They suddenly split formation and went in different directions, following  behind were 4 or 5 of the same red lights.   We watched them for a few minutes then all of a sudden they all disappeared.;43.1888949999999;-70.8865862500001

Yellowish/Orange light moving strangely;2019-08-05 23:00:00;2 minutes;Yellowish/Orange light moving strangely I had just gone out to sit on the steps and call my grandmother when I noticed a bright yellowish/orange light moving slowly across the sky.  It wasn’t making any noise so I watched it carefully and noticed that it wasn’t moving at a consistent speed or in a straight line.  I looked down at my phone for probably 2 seconds and when I looked back up it was gone.;43.1888949999999;-70.8865862500001
