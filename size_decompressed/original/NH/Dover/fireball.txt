Light in the shape of a ball lit up the sky over my car as I drove to work, it flashed. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD));2012-02-28 22:10:00;30 seconds;An object of light in the shape of a ball lit up the sky over my car as I drove to work, it flashed and disappeared. The following event happened last evening as I was driving alone. It occurred while I was approaching a stop sign on my way to work, a bright ball of light went over my vehicle in the sky. The ball of light illuminated the entire night sky, it appeared to descend into the wooded area across the street from the stop sign. As the ball of light went over the tree line it appeared to flash without making a sound.  It then dissipated and transitioned back to natural darkness.  I proceeded to work and returned home and informed my husband. He was intrigued and I thought it was a weird occurrence.  I thought I would report it. My daughter joked it was the end of the world and my son was sure it was an alien with a wink and a nod.  Like I said before, I thought it was weird. My husband was curious but not all that moved by the event.  He joked that we should get the flashlights and go investigate the crash site. Needless to say, we were fast asleep shortly thereafter. Hopefully this sighting was a mere meteorite and not the beginning of the return of the ancient aliens. Thanks. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD));43.1888949999999;-70.8865862500001
Bright green fireball with tail seen by many beside highway going into Dover, near traffic lights;2014-11-22 23:50:00;4-5 seconds;Bright green fireball with tail seen by many beside highway going into Dover, near traffic lights Driving into Dover near the traffic lights, four people in the car, and the two people in the front seat both witnessed it. 50-100 feet from the highway, a bright green fireball (the color of a green traffic light) fell out of the sky, with a tail, and faded away after 4-5 seconds of first seeing it.  Large enough to know that it couldn't have been a shooting star and was definitely very close to highway.;43.1888949999999;-70.8865862500001
Orange spheres travelling in a pack of 10-15 moving left to right across the sky in Dover NH;2014-11-23 17:25:00;5-7 minutes;Orange spheres travelling in a pack of 10-15 moving left to right across the sky in Dover NH We were letting the dog out because he was freaking out inside.  The weather was abnormally warm for New England in late November.  Hardly any wind and around 50 degrees.   My wife noticed it first.  Moving left to right from the horizon were what looked like orange orb fireballs.  Moving very slow high up in the atmosphere about the size of a ping pong ball if you were holding it in your hand stretched out.  It was like watching meteors entering our atmosphere one by one but in slow motion.  They were travelling very slow.  The formation was way too consistent for it to be a Chinese Lantern.  I would say between 10-15 objects came through then vanished.  My video caught them as you see in most videos but it was nothing compared to the experience.  The video actually picked up more of them coming in real fast then zig zagging out of the atmosphere at speeds I have never seen before.  ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness and he sounded to us to be quite serious-minded and credible.  PD)) I am 39, my wife is 42, and my daughter is 19 and we all were pretty freaked out by the experience.  I have seen nothing in the Dover/Somersworth area on the news, but I do know that 10 miles from my house was the Exeter sighting 30+years ago. The Dover Police dept did take a few calls similar to mine.  I also saw a woman in Rochester 2 years ago documented the same thing I saw.  That town is only 7 miles away.;43.1888949999999;-70.8865862500001
