Triangular shaped object floating or moving very slowly near Route 16 between exits 8 and 9 in Dover, NH;2004-03-09 18:45:00;15 minutes;Triangular shaped object floating or moving very slowly near Route 16 between exits 8 and 9 in Dover, NH I was driving home from work on Route 16 between exits 8 and 9 heading north when I saw a triangular shaped object floating, or moving very slowly, ahead of me and to the left.  The time was 6:45 PM.  As I got nearer, I could see brightly colored lights on the bottom of it and two bright headlights at the front of it.  It was only 100 to 200 feet off the highway to my left side and about 100 or so feet in the air.  It seemed to be surrounded by a light layer of fog.  I was so intrigued by it that I decided to backtrack to try to find its location.  I got off the highway at exit 9 and proceeded to Tolend Road.  After I got on Tolend Road and crossed the bridge that goes over Route 16, I saw it again.  The time now was 6:55 PM, or so.  It flew over the road right in front of me, travelling perpendicular to the direction of the road from my right to my left.  This time, there didn't seem to be any fog surronding it.  I only saw it for a few seconds before it disappeared behind the trees to my left.  Again, it looked to be triangular and had two very bright headlights in front.  It couldn't have been going very fast.  I would say no more than 25 to 50 miles per hour which seems to be way to slow for an airplane to travel.  It was approximately 100 feet in the air at this point.  Another interesting thing that I only realized after my friend started to ask me about it was that this object was very quiet.  Despite the fact that I was in a running car with the windows up, the object didn't seem to make a sound, which was strange given how close it was.  Clearly, I would have heard it if it was a helicopter or an airplane.;43.1888949999999;-70.8865862500001
one UFO spotted in the skys over Dover NH, making amazing turns with its bright pinkish/red lights;2006-09-25 20:20:00;20 minutes;one UFO spotted in the skys over Dover NH, making amazing turns with its bright pinkish/red lights I was outside on my back porch smoking a cig, and then I happend to look up and there was this craft to my south about 2 miles away (guess) and I thought it was weird because it was glowing Pinkish/red and then it started to head my way. After this happend I was so confused because I didnt know what it was and then I got my mother and my sister to come outside and check out the sitiuation. We were amazed at the speed and the flight pattterns of this craft. It made a 90 degree turn out of the blue and then came over our house this is where we got the best view of it. The UFO was triangler shap with lights on each end of it, it made no noise. We live near an old Airforce base PEASE so we thought it might be a expermental plane but it then was gowing around in circler motion and then making impossible turns and then went back towards pease about 2 miles from out house and then it came back to our house, and flew over. All of a sudden we all heard noise and it was two jets taking off from pease loud like military after they take off they looked like it was persuing it. The craft then flew back from pease and towards our house and then made another amazing turn and then disapeered. I'm very confused on what happend and to scared to call PEASE and ask them what it was because I dont think they will tell my the truth or tell me i didnt see what I saw. I didnt get any pictures or video footage none aviable at the time.;43.1888949999999;-70.8865862500001

Three orbs of green light either attached to a large thin triangle shape or flying individually  in triangle formation.;2015-11-01 17:15:00;<1 minute;Three orbs of green light either attached to a large thin triangle shape or flying individually  in triangle formation.   Was driving over the bridge on ME-101 into Dover from Eliot, ME, and saw the craft(s) hovering low in the sky for a few seconds, then flew down below the tree line with extreme speed in the direction of the Cocheco Country Club.   The object was close enough to me that I would be able to tell if it was an airplane, but I did not recognize it as any sort of aircraft I'd ever seen in my life.

At 11:50pm on July 27,2021, I saw red dots lights in a Christmas tree or triangle form. It was stationary for about a minute, then the dots faded to orange color and began to move slowly forward. As it moved color changed to white light, like a small fireball or star. After about 3 minutes, the color faded back to the red orange dotted triangle shape, then it receded, and completely disappeared. After 30 minutes, now Wednesday, July 28, 2021 at 12:20 AM EST, there appeared TWO of the exact same sighting I just described here. The second sightings were further away than the initial sighting.  Both sightings included being stationary at first, then slow aligned movement, and sudden light fading then complete disappearance. Both lasted about 3 minutes. They appeared to move to a single same point in the sky before disappearing;43.1888949999999;-70.8865862500001
