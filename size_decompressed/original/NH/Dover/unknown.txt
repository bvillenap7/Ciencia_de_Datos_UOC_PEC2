I was traveling north on Pickering road in Rochester NH, around 7:00am, when I noticed above the horizon  in the northeast sky which appeared to be a shiny metallic object undistinguishable in shape due to the amount of time I had to view the object. When first noticed the sun was shining on the object which gave it a brilliant appearance. It seemed to be stationary when I first noticed it, then suddenly it shot across the northeast horizon at a very high rate of speed.;43.1888949999999;-70.8865862500001
A metallic object in the sky vanished before our eyes, with no clouds or anything else to obscure our view.;2011-06-29 21:00:00;10 seconds;A metallic object in the sky vanished before our eyes, with no clouds or anything else to obscure our view. While driving to a concert, my friend & I saw a metallic object in the sky.   The sun had just set, and the sky was a nice deep blue, just before it got dark.   We saw a metallic object hovering through the sky, and then the object disappeared right before our eyes.  There were no clouds or anything to obscure our view.  The object simply vanished in thin air.;43.1888949999999;-70.8865862500001
Large object with many lights, one large,bright light on the side, hovering over a semi-residential area near two large fields.;2011-07-21 22:35:00;Unknown;Large object with many lights, one large,bright light on the side, hovering over a semi-residential area near two large fields. I was driving down a back road in Dover, NH, and saw a very bright light shining towards a field (from the side of the craft) at first I thought it was a plane that was going to crash over a scattered residential area,  then I realized it was just low in the sky and stationary.   It was hovering with lots of lights, one very bright light. As I continued driving I slowed way down and saw that this was a very large object and was too high in the sky to be something from the ground and had too many lights on the bottom.  The object was stationary in the air and the bottom had round lights.  It almost looked like it could have had a boomerang shape, but was a lot larger than I expected when I was closer.   I was scared so I continued driving.  I've never seen anything like this before and I was very scared.   I could only see it close through some trees and didn't a clear look at it.;43.1888949999999;-70.8865862500001
