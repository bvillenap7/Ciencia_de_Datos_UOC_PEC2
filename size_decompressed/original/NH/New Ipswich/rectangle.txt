((HOAX??))  A loud vibrating sound and a low flying well lit, slow moving craft.;2007-04-22 15:00:00;3 minutes;A loud vibrating sound and a low flying well lit, slow moving craft. I was lying in bed trying to sleep.  I was listening to a talk radio show.  I started to doze off but awoke to a very loud vibrating sound.  It was very loud and caused me alarm.  I went to the window and saw a low flying well lit craft flying over my condo.  The sound also woke up my boyfriend, who is an incredibly deep sleeper.
