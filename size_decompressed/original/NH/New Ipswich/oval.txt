Yellow, disk-like, glowing object moving slowly over New Ipswich, NH.;2016-10-07 21:15:00;1 hour total;yellow, disk-like, glowing object moving slowly over New Ipswich, NH Oct. 7, 2016.  About 8:15pm to 9:15pm  Left Worcester, MA, heading north on I190, saw a yellow, glowing, elliptical-shape (like a flat disk seen nearly edge-on) object very far in the east, moving slowly to the south against the stars.  Nothing unusual about the motion, rather airplane-like. About 1 hour later, saw a very similar object, much closer, cross the road (now NH124, near the New Ipswich/Mason town line) from south to north.  Yellow, glowing, elliptical, and fuzzy-looking, with a fuzzy reddish spot near the trailing end.  Very roughly, about 1-2x the size of the Moon.  I was passenger so I could continue tracking it through the trees as it continued northward. Again, moving in a very airplane-like, straight and level fashion.  Very rough guesstimate, about 1000 ft up, based on how it seemed to move.  Lost sight of it due to distance, never recovered it again.;42.7491;-71.8656
