This just happened 10 minutes ago. This is NOT a joke. I slept out in my barn tonight. The barn has big bay windows. I was in my sleeping bag watching the stars when I saw a octogon/saucer disc shaped craft take off from the trees at the end of my woods propery line. It took off, maybe 300-400 ft above my house and I watched it hover until i couldn't see it through the bay windows anymore. I ran outside and watched it decend into the trees behind the church across the street from my house. It made a humming noise. I ran inside and got my parents to come out and take a look. We didn't find any trace of the craft. This is the coolest thing that ever happened to me especially since I recently did a school report on UFO's.;42.7491;-71.8656
