Large disk with lights on each side of craft seen over New Durham;2012-12-06 18:30:00;2 minute;Large disk with lights on each side of craft seen over New Durham At first I thought I was seeing 2 airplanes flying in an east or northeasterly direction, one ahead of the other.  The one in the back got closer to the front one.  I was concerned about a mid-air collision and pointed it out to my friend that was with me saying, That looks dangerous.  I’m surprised they’re allowed to fly that close together especially at night.  The white lights continued to get closer together and closer to where we were standing, and then slowed down a bit.   Then we realized that it was not two airplanes but was one extremely big round machine with white lights on opposite sides.  The reason it looked like two planes getting closer together was because it had lights on the left and lights on the right of it and it was slowly spinning/turning giving the illusion of 2 planes getting closer.  We watched it for quite a while until it sunk below the top of the tree line until we couldn't see it anymore.   The other odd thing was that there ! was no sound whatsoever, not even after it had passed us.  Both observers are middle-aged, 1 male, 1 female, both completely sober.;43.4386;-71.1491
