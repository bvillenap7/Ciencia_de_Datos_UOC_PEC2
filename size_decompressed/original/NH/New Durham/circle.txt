((HOAX??))  i looked up at the sky when parking my truck, and saw a light change direction quickly.;2008-02-20 23:15:00;30 seconds;i looked up at the sky when parking my truck, and saw a light change direction quickly. I was pulling into my parking spot on copplecrown mtn, when i looked up and saw a bright light heading north towards the constellation orion, in a straight line, then it turned quickly and headed east. I observed the light for approx. 30 seconds when it dissapeared. i'm not crazy or drunk, I was afraid of the movement. ((NUFORC Note:  The constellation, Orion, is in the southern sky.  Possible hoax, we wonder.  PD));43.4386;-71.1491
