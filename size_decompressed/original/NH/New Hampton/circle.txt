The 4 objects would gather at the center of the cloud and then disperse very quickly to the edges, each one moving in a different direction and appearing to move in a circle until reuniting back at the center of the cloud. The entire process too about 10 seconds, continually moving out from and than back to center. I parked the car and watched the event for about 20 minutes. They moved within the cloud and with the cloud. They did not travel in a straight line from the center, more of a haphazard movement. It was the strangest thing I've ever seen.;43.6185;-71.6462
