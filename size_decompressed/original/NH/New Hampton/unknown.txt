My daughter, son-in-law, and their family were on vacation at Jellystone Campground in New Hampton, New Hampshire starting on Sunday, August 5 through Thursday,  August 9, 2012.    My daughter took 379 photos of their vacation and while reviewing them on her camera, she noticed the object in the sky in the photo I am going to email to you.  Her camera has the ability to zoom in on photos already taken, and this object does not appear to be an airplane, helicopter, Frisbee, weather balloon, etc.  She did not know what it was.;43.6185;-71.6462
Extremely loud jet like noises with none in sight.;2016-03-09 10:00:00;6 minutes;Extreamly loud jet like noises with none in sight Approximately 10:00 am.  3/9/16 I was on my deck and herd what I thought was a jet.  I looked up to see it and could see nothing.  The sky was clear with a few light clouds.  As I watched and listened, it came and went almost as if flying back and forth.  It kept getting louder and softer.  At a couple of points it was loud enough to hurt my ears.  This lasted about 6 min.  It sounded like many jets flying over one after the other, but I could see nothing.  If it was military jets then they were high enough so you couldn't see them with the naked eye, yet loud enough to hurt your ears.  I don't know what it was.;43.6185;-71.6462
