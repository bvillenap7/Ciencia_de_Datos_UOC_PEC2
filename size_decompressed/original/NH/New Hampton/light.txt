Row of Bright White/Yellowish Lights.;2013-11-20 18:00:00;5 seconds;Row of Bright White/Yellowish Lights Last night 11/20/13, around 6 PM, I was driving home north on I-93 in New Hampshire (around New Hampton/Sanbornton).  I was in between exit 22 and 23 heading north. All of a sudden I noticed a kind of line of bright lights (Kind of like the old fashion street light= white with a yellowish/orange tint).  There were about 5 in row.....  I was looking up ahead through the windshield and was puzzled by what I saw.   Then the lights pretty much faded out one at a time.... I did not see movement, nor did I see any type of craft, just these lights and as soon as I noticed them, the started going out.  It seemed that the lights went out one at a time from right to left.   It was quick and only lasted for a quick couple of seconds.   Definitely not an airplane, lights were two big and bright and definitely not stars... much larger than stars.... Not sure what it was, but it was quick and it was odd.... out of place...and the lights started going out one at a time as soon as I noticed themâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Solid white streak of light flashed as it dived toward the ground.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor?  PD));2014-08-11 23:15:00;2 seconds;Solid white streak of light flashed as it dived toward the ground. I was driving SB on I-93 between Ashland and New Hampton, when to my right I saw a streak of white light heading down below the treeline.  Started about a quarter mile up at a point and the streak widened as it went over the treeline.   The streak had defined edges to it.  If I had to guess, it would have landed in the vicinity between Bristol and New Hampton, near 106. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.

Single light multiplies into 3 over highway then disappears;2014-10-17 18:25:00;30 seconds;Single light multiplies into 3 over highway then disappears. We were driving on 93 north bound around New Hampton, NH, at dusk and saw a very bright white light just above the hills/mountains.  My husband noticed it at the same time, and just then the one light multiplied into three bright lights in a vertical line.   The three lights were all the same size, had no smoke trails or anything, and then disappeared to a single point all at the same time.   We saw one more bright light in the same direction about 2 minutes later and then it was gone.   These lights were not planes, fireworks, flares, or stars!;43.6185;-71.6462
