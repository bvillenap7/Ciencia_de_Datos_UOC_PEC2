They were completely silent and appeared to float and drift around.  They disappeared.   I went inside and came out a few minutes later.  They had returned and were much closer.  They had the same appearance.  Again, they appeared to almost dance around and drift along the tree tops.  They floated across the road and disappeared down behind my neighbor's house.
