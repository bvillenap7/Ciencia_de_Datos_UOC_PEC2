White & green Light formation west of Canaan, NH.;2018-01-10 19:45:00;5 minutes;White & Green Light formation west of Canaan, NH. At approximately 7:45pm, my wife called me out to the back porch, looking west from Canaan, NH, toward Lebanon, NH.  She pointed out 6-9 lights, seemingly stationary, possibly moving slightly in formation.   The lights were a mixture of white and green, and after a few minutes of hovering/floating in the same space over the horizon across the valley above the mountains in the distance (hard to tell how far, as it was otherwise dark around the object), all lights vanished at once.;43.6614;-72.0309
