I look up and see 2 bright white circles flying in what appears to be a side by side formation, keeping a uniform speed and a steady/consistent distance apart from each other.   At first I did not think much of the lights, just assuming two planes were flying in formation.  I watched the the lights the rest of my drive home.  When I pulled into my drive way and parked, I continued to watch the lights.  This is when things started getting odd.  One of the two bright lights approached the 2nd light and appeared to combined into the other object.  When that happened, it became brighter.   While this was going on, I saw lights from a helicopter also appear.  I am in flight school to become a helicopter pilot and have many hours logged in a helicopter.  So I am very aware of what the position lights on a helicopter look like from a distance.  With that said, you could see the helicopter moving in a normal pattern circled underneath the bizarre lights, coming in and out of view... while the lights I have no explanation for were disappearing and reappearing every 15 seconds.   The event lasted about 10 minutes... I have no explanation for it. My dog was also watching out the window at what I was witnessing, and if he was some how aware of its presence.;42.8794;-70.8644
