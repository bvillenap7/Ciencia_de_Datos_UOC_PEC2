6 lighted triangles floating independently in a line moving slowly;1988-08-15 22:00:00;4 min;6 lighted triangles floating independently in a line moving slowly On vacation in Aug of 1988.  We were walking up and down the streets hanging out with other kids on vacation I was 18.  We looked up over towards the power plant and saw red triangular lights or lighted triangles.  They were in a line but floating slowly like they were not attached to one another but gently floating in a line.  The triangles kept their angle with the points pointing down and a flat side on top.  We all ran back to the cottages we were staying in to tell the parents but when we went back outside they were gone.  I wold like to be contacted to know what they were or if anyone ever reported seeing them.;42.8794;-70.8644
