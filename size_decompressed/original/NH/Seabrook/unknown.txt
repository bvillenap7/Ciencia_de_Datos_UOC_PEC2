Orange light hovering by power plant;2011-07-04 21:45:00;45 sec;Orange light hovering by power plant Was taking out the trash at work at about 9:45 pm.  When I saw an orange light in the sky to the west of me above the tree line. It hovered in place for about 30 seconds and then went straight down below the tree line without loosing any brightness at all. A simiular object was sighted in the same area about 2 weeks before.  This is also in the area of a nuclear power plant.;42.8794;-70.8644
