Circular white light instant acceleration defy forces of gravity no sound Claremont self storage Washington street;2021-07-16 22:30:00;20 mins;Circular white light instant acceleration defy forces of gravity no sound Claremont self storage Washington street My wife and I were emptying out our old storage unit from the end of Washington street Claremont when I saw what I thought was a shooting star I literally said aww babe you missed it. Then it came back and was going back and forth from one side of the sky to the other back and forth performing circles figure rights unbelievable speed no sound from it at all .then it would just stop and shoot straight down to the ground it looked as if it landed or crashed at the top of green mountain road then it would shoot back up at unreal speeds however Everytime it seemed to land there would be a bright white flash of light then back to doing more spins and back and forth maneuvers by the time the first two minutes had past watching this incredible circular white light my wife was so scared she fled to the U-Haul and was yelling to leave this was unbelievable the speed on this object from zero mph to the other side of the sky in less then a second it's not possible with! our current understanding of physics the whole time I'm watching this I'm literally yelling like a fool what are you? Please show yourself! I need to know how they survived the g forces of this display.;43.3656;-72.3442
