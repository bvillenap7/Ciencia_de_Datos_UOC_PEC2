3 silent, lightless, orange ball-shaped objects very slowly hovering appx. 30 feet above us.;2013-01-01 00:15:00;5 minutes;3 silent, lightless, orange ball-shaped objects very slowly hovering appx. 30 feet above us. I was outside next to my car, when the other witness told me to look up in the sky.  There were no sounds or lights, just two - then a third one in a few minutes - round, light orange, ball-shaped figures approximately 2 to 3 feet in diameter, hovering about 30 feet above our heads, slowly passing over the garage roof.  They made no noise and were moving very slowly.   The third one slowly appeared as the other two were disappearing into the fog.   We stood there watching them until they were gone.

I saw a large bright glowing ball that was moving at a slow rate of speed.  It was moving in a south east direction for about 15 seconds and all of a sudden, it took off at a high rate of speed and disappeared.  I observed this at a friendâ€™s house on a mountain.;43.3656;-72.3442
