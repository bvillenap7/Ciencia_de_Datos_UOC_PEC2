I went back too my tv show, after it was over I looked out and saw the bright light again, all of a sudden it shot straight down, in about 1 sec. it was gone. week later about an hour before dark, I stepped out my  back door to have a smoke . and there standing broadside about 20 ft. away , was an animal I have never seen before. I grew up hunting and fishing since I can remember. I'm almost70 now. I have seen the light several times since, but fri. 28 that around 6:30 pm. I saw it again this time it was brighter than ever in the eastern sky' it appeared brighter than the first time it didn't move after 10 min. I went back inside abd an hour or so latter it was gone.;43.5759;-71.966
