We saw what appeared to by two separate flames.  My wife asked if it could be hot air balloons, but I stated it was moving to fast.  It or they appeared from the east/south east and moved off to the west/North West. We heard no sound nor did we see any stars. I tried to take some pictures and saw what may have been one star, after enlarging the photo. Photo shows two orange dots, which is what we saw.

White flashing lights seen heading east from Belmont, NH;2019-11-16 17:00:00;3 minutes;White flashing lights seen heading east from Belmont, NH Bright white flashing lights in the sky caught our attention. We only had a view through the trees and could not make out the shape of the crafts (there appeared to be two).  One craft had multiple lights, possibly four,  blinking randomly but with only one light lit at a time. The other craft had a single, non-flashing light.  Both were moving away from us, heading roughly east, toward the Belknap mountains.;43.4512;-71.489
