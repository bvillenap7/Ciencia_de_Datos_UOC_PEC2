Group of white lights over lake;2005-08-22 21:00:00;30 minutes;Group of white lights over lake At 9:00 PM, a group of 12 white blinking lights were spotted over Lake Winnisquam, headed south over Belmont. I grabbed binoculars and followed in my truck. I lost sight of them because of trees. At the southern end of the lake I spotted 6 in a group, silently gliding through the sky just above the trees on the Belmont side. The group had split up and these 6 had reversed direction and headed north.  I observed them for 10 minutes until they were out of view. At 10:30 PM, 3 blinking white lights, in single file but close together, slowly flew over Lake Winnisquam from Meredith, down the Sanbornton side.  At the exact same time, all 3 stopped blinking and turned orange.  The 3 orange lights continued slowly just above the wooded areas of Sanbornton and Belmont, until out of view.;43.4512;-71.489

It lasted about 4 seconds, then it was gone. My husband and I were outside talking, and all of the sudden we see this bright like fireball fall from the sky, and it looked like it was heading for the back yard. It made no sound at all.it lasted about four seconds then it was gone.  No trail mark was left behind either.;43.4512;-71.489
