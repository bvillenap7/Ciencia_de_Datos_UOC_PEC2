Large white orb hovering in the sky.;2010-04-22 00:51:00;10 seconds;Large white orb hovering in the sky. I had just happened to glance out my bedroom window, which looks out into the front yard, and noticed either a very large or very close ball of white light. The best I could explain it's location is that it was hovering a few dozen feet over my neighbor's house, but since I wasn't able to determine exactly how close or how far away it was, it may not have been over his house at all and only appeared that way. I immediately reached for my camera phone, fumbling with it as I tried to power it on. By the time it was turned on though and I had it aimed out the window the light was gone. The entire experience lasted anywhere from ten to thirty seconds.;42.9142;-71.0631
