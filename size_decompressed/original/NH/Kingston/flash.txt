Oblong shaped light with faint beams shining from the two opposite ends.  Yellowish hue with no blinking lights.  Silent and traveling in a straight line, west to east.   Difficult to gauge height or speed, due to darkness and lack of perspective common in the night sky.;42.9142;-71.0631

The first four objects i saw looked like a very dim lit star in the sky.  no blinking lights just a star moving across the sky.  the lights were moving in a grid like pattern back and forth up and down.   at the point i went inside to grab binoculars.  i knew it wasn't natural what i was seeing, but i wasn't convinced it was a ufo until what happened next.  when i returned with the binoculars i was still tracking this star light object.  what convinced me was the object made a 90 degree turn and as it did there was a flash of blue light.  the light lasted a second and objected continued to cross parallel in front of me. as i was following it with my eyes it looked like it stopped behind some clouds.  when i was looking at the cloud it looked like there was lightening in the cloud.  small flashes of light were coming from behind the cloud and the object never reappeared.;42.9142;-71.0631
