White, oblong-with-appendage, silent, high elevation, over 1000mph, no sonic boom, erratic trajectory.;2012-09-21 17:00:00;5-8 seconds;White, oblong-with-appendage, silent, high elevation, over 1000mph, no sonic boom, erratic trajectory. On Friday, Sept. 21st, 2012, at my home in Epsom, NH at about 5:00PM, I saw a craft I could not identify. The craft was at a much higher elevation than any commercial jet, was completely silent, and was going roughly 3 times as fast as a commercial jet (without making a sonic boom although well over 1000mph). It did not have a straight trajectory, it was bouncing around a bit but nonetheless was going extremely fast. It was white-looking, oblong shaped, with an appendage on the top of it.  It did not look like any aerodynamic craft I know of.  It was much too elevated and fast to be a plane or weather balloon, but was not high enough to be a satellite.;43.2197;-71.3589
