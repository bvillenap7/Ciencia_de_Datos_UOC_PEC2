Moving slowly and looked shaky, and not in a straight line.  First noticed through open upper deck screened doors of our lake facing camp. Because it looked strange and not like a plane or a shooting star we rushed downstairs and outside. It was easy to follow in the clear sky.  Looking up and through the pine trees as it passed from directions South to Southeasterly toward the area of the sky where the (full?) moon was rising then vanished  Approximately, 3.5 minutes time. Second sighting off lower deck of same camp at  7:14 pm.  Same as above.  Took picture with cell phone.  Captured partial photograph of it- just a small section of the  redish/gold tinged circumference.  It hovered and suddenly changed shape into three bright white dots looked like the corners of a triangle, then returned back to orb shape and colors and vanished.   Approximately, 1.5 minutes time.;43.3566;-71.2424
