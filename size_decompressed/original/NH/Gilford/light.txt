We were traveling South on the bypass outside of Laconia in Gilford, NH, when we noticed and orange ball of light off to the left.  This ball was floating about 500 feet above the treetops.  Soon we saw more following in a pack and there were a total of 5 orange orbs.  Silent as they floated along.  They were independent of one another and floated in various directions yet as a pack.   These were watched by us for 10 minutes until they disappeared behind tree lines. ((NUFORC Note:  Time of sighting is flawed.  We will contact the source to confirm the correct time.
