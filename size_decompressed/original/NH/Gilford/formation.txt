Driving from Sanborton to Gilford and saw 4 luminous lights, merging together and then coming apart. ((NUFORC Note:  Adv. Lights?? PD));2014-06-16 00:00:00;1 hour;Driving from Anborton to Gilford and saw 4 luminous lights in sky merging together and then coming apart I was driving home from work in Sanbornton going to Gilford, NH, and saw 4 lights in the sky, 4 light formations, flying, hovering, merging together and then coming apart, seemed to be making some sort of pattern in the sky with its movements but it was not a 100% consistent pattern, it changed slightly each time they merged together and came apart.   Not sure if these lights had something to do with the motorcycle Bike Week Event going on in town of Laconia, NH.   Maybe they were just some light reflections of some sort, that I was seeing, coming from another source, I am not sure. ((NUFORC Note:  The description makes us wonder whether the witness might have been observing advertising lights.  No other reports PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.5454;-71.407
