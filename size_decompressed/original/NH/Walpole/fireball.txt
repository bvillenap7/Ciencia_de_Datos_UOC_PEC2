Observed neon green fireball travelling east to west almost horizontally. Object had two separate points of light and tails, but was definitely one object. It resembled large fireworks and burned up before it could strike the ground. It made no noise. Firball moved slower than an ordinary shooting star. Several other fireball sightings, some hitting the ground, were observed on the same night and in the same general area. These were reported to local authorities.;43.0803;-72.4151
Neon green fireballs over Cheshire County, New Hampshire.;2000-12-26 18:20:00;4-5seconds;Neon green fireballs over Cheshire County, New Hampshire. Neon green fireball with 2 seperate glowing points and tails, travelling east to west - almost horizontally. Object moved slower than a standard meteor or shooting star. My first impression was that it was fireworks. Object made no noise and burned up before it could hit the ground. Several other reports of larger green and blue fireballs, some hitting the ground, were called into local authorities - same night/same time. ((NUFORC Note:  Many witnesses to this event, apparently.  Several New England newspapers published articles about it.  We would welcome reports from anyone who may have seen the object, in which they indicate exactly where they were located, what direction they were looking, and the direction they were looking at the moment the object disappeared from their sight.  Thank you.  PD));43.0803;-72.4151
