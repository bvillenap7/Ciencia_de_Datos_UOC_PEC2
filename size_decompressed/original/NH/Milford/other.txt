Orange light.;2014-06-14 22:00:00;3 minutes;Orange light , thought it might have been an aircraft first.   Then, it moved zig zag very quickly.   Then it moved straight line and I thought, a star or meteorite.   Then it went back to the place it was before.  Then it went behind clouds?  I could still see a faint light.  Very unsettling.
