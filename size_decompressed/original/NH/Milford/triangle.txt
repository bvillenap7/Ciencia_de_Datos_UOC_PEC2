As we approached the underpass to rt. 101 we were able to see the craft hovering above the 101 where we were about to get on.   We waited at a red light and I rolled down my window thinking it might be an airplane but there was no noise at all and it was completely still in the air.   We watched it for about 30 seconds as we waited.  Right as we were about to get on the highway to get a better view the craft quickly moved away from us heading east down 101A and disappeared.  It had at least 3 solid white lights and some flashing white lights too.;42.8276;-71.6595
Low flying set of three white lights in triangle formation, with occasional red flashing light between them.;2015-02-05 22:45:00;3-4 minutes;Low flying set of three white lights in triangle formation, with occasional red flashing light between them. Driving down the road, spotted 2 white lights far apart and low flying, coming towards me then veering slightly more west.  Turned onto a road following its path, and once I was underneath, I noticed a third back light and an occasional red flash between the three lights.   It was lower now and  had slowed almost to a stop and then suddenly sped up twice as fast flying south west.  No sound heard.;42.8276;-71.6595
