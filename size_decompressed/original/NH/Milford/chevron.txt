Chevron shaped object over Milford, NH, with many lights flying low making no sound.;2014-07-31 03:45:00;45 seconds;Chevron shaped object over Milford, NH, with many lights flying low making no sound. At approximately 3:45 am I was standing at our kitchen window when I saw what I thought was an airplane moving overhead heading in a northerly direction. I immediately went out side onto our deck to get a better look because I could not hear it in spite of how low it was flying.  It was shaped like a chevron or triangle, flying quite a bit lower than air traffic does in our area, was making no sound at all and had more lights than an airplane usually does. I could not see the object itself, just the lights.  What struck me was the total silence.  As low as this thing was flying I heard nothing at all. As I watched it continued to move north silently until I could not see it anymore. I am a 51 year old female and have never seen anything like this before.
