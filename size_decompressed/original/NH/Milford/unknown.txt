Orange object traveling slowly in sky, met up with second object and floated in sky.;2014-07-03 21:20:00;5 minutes;Orange object traveling slowly in sky, met up with second object and floated in sky Traveling North on Osgood coming up on Milford Middle school observed a bright orange light traveling slowly East.  Size, shape and color made caught my eye and at first thought it might be a meteor but appeared to be traveling too slow.  It met up with a second light, it looked as if the lights met and then backed away from each other.  They were then floating, horizontally from each other until minutes later the clouds from the storm covered them and I couldn't see them anymore.  No sound;42.8276;-71.6595
