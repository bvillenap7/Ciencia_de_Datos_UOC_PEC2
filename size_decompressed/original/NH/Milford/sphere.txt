I was walking out walking my dog down my street heading south.  I noticed two commercial aircraft flying overhead heading south/south-west.   At that exact time that I looked up I noticed an object that at the time I looked at it, it was stationary, and in a split second the object went from a stand still, to moving faster than any aircraft I've ever seen, and I served in the U.S. NAVY, and was subject to many different types of air craft and never saw anything move that fast.   The object was moving south, it went as far as my eyes could see until it faded out of my sight.  From what I could see with my own two eyes, it appeared to be spherical.  There was no tail following this object so it did not appear to be a shooting star or meteor and was much to low in elevation to support that.;42.8276;-71.6595
