On August 12, 2011, my husband and I were down at a park in New Castle, NH at the end of a pier talking to a gentleman that was fishing in the ocean there.  All of a sudden, my husband exclaimed Whoa! What is that? We turned to look in the direction where he was referring to and there were five red lights (about the color of a stop light).  From where we were standing the lights appeared to be approx. the size of a grapefruit-maybe a little bigger. At first they were close together but not in any type of formation.  Then one by one, they started to flicker and fade away.  Then within a matter of 4-5 seconds we noticed them on the horizon appearing like they were rising up from the top of the water.  Three of them then formed a triangular shape and the other two just faded out. The triangle formation just hovered for a little while.  The whole sighting from beginning to end lasted around 10 minutes maybe a little less.  There was absolutely no sound coming from them from where we were standing. I managed to get a very poor picture of the triangular formation with the camera on my phone, which I will enclose as well. I was just curious to see if anyone else noticed these lights as well.  I was surprised not to see any reports of them today.  Just curious to find out what they were.  It was interesting to watch regardless of what they were.  I know that there was a meteor shower that was supposed to occur. But these lights did not shoot across the sky.  As I said before they just hovered then slowly faded away. In the picture I am enclosing, you can see the triangle just to the right of the little house on the island.  I wish it were clearer.;43.0663;-70.7247
