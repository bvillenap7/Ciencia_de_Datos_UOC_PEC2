About small aircraft distance away. Moving fast across the sky looked like the shape of a hot air balloon. I was getting a fire going out side with my two daughters and ones mom.  To hang and cook some sâ€™mores.  When the mother and oldest daughter started saying loudly.  What is that ?!  What is that ?!   In some kind of panic / nervous voice . As they where looking up pointing I was thinking they saw an animal in a tree.  As I came over and said what where.  They pointed in a different direction as I seen this big bright orange type color like the shape of a hot air balloon.  Going across the sky.  Moving fast but not a like flash fast. Airplane fast but way to big and oddly shaped for an airplane.   I am ex military.  Served over seas and this made my hairs stand some.  There was and airplane at a decent amount of distance behind it heading in the same direction towards it.;43.1128;-71.9029
