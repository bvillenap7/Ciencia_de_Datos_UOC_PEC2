Seen a neon green light behind a funnel-shaped cloud accompanied by a humming/buzzing sound.;2014-12-14 23:00:00;10 minutes;Seen a neon green light behind a funnel-shaped cloud accompanied by a humming/buzzing sound. My boyfriend and I were watching the meteor shower and throughout the night, I kept seeing a flash of light at the corner of my vision, so I thought I had an issue with my eye or something.  At one point when I was facing in the exact direction of the light, I clearly seen a neon green flash of light and I asked my boyfriend if he had seen it and he did.  It was funny too because he also told me had kept seeing it at the corner of his eye as well and he thought it was something messed up with his vision/eye as well.   So, after we both realized this flash of light was legitmate, we both sat and stared in the direction of the light.  There was a wide tornado-shaped cloud above the mountain range in the distance but we had a clear view of this phenomenon.  The cloud kept lighting up neon green and at some points it would blink very fast and at other times it would go bright gradually and then dim down slowly.   Also, there was a strange humming or buzzing noise accompanying this incident.  It was very strange....we also started to hear coyotes crying/howling in the distance so we ended up leaving the spot we were at.  After hearing the coyotes, the light also went away.   It freaked us out pretty bad! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.1128;-71.9029
