My boyfriend and I were driving through town when we noticed a triangle-shaped craft above the tree tops.  It was a black triangle with white lights at each corner. One of the lights was blinking.  About five seconds after seeing this triangle-shaped craft, two more came into view.  All three crafts were the same and they flew across the sky in a triangle-formation.  There was no sound at all and then they disappeared over a building and the trees. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.1128;-71.9029
