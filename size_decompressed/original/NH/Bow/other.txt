I was out on my deck, all lights out, watching satellites pass over - all of a sudden a diamond shape of lights appeared dirctly over me. it literally appeared out of nowhere. It was NOT an airplane, at least not a commercial plane - it's sudden appearance seemed surreal - as if three stars moved into a diamond shape. I watched for a  a good ten seconds  - ran into the house to alert my family to come see and when we came out it was gone.  I should have stayed outside with it - maybe it was a stealth plane - but it had to be one that could stop and stand still in the sky.  This happened over half a year ago and I think about it ofen.  I love to watch the sky at night. In New Hamshire the night is so dark we can see the milky way at night -this was different.;43.1403;-71.5444
