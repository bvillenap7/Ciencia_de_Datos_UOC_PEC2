They almost looked cloud like but there were no clouds near. Triangle object with 3 white lights and 1 red light sighted in Bow, NH. I had just shut off my alarm at approximately 4:40 am on 5/13/16 and looked out the bedroom window.  I saw a very large triangle shaped object, not elongated, fly by very close to the trees.  The triangle object was a dark gray/black and had white lights near each point of the triangle. These lights were not bright like a spot light, more like an indoor light, and a slow blinking, red light near the center.  Each of the 4 lights were round. It glided into view, then made a sharp right turn and disappeared out of my view due to the tree line.  I have seen this same object years ago. It did not make a sound.  It happened too quickly to get pictures or any other details.  Duration was about 8 to 10 seconds.  It did not seem to have a path of flight like an airplane, and it hovered a little before turning away. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
