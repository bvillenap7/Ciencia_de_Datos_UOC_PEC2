It started as a yellow orange and red blinking light. The lights were moving up and down and side to side, but not making much movement until all of the sudden it started to move up very quickly. It then started moving east still blinking until it was almost right over us. The shape could be made out as a sphere with blinking rotating lights on the sides. The rate at which it moved across the sky was incredibly fast. It soon became out of sight as it had moved right.;43.1403;-71.5444
