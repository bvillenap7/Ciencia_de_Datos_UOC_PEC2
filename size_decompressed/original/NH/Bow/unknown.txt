One passed directly over us, and pretty low, only we could not see the craft, only a string of light on the back that appeared to change from green to yellow in a row.  there was not a single noise.we noticed all four coming from different directions covering a space of at least 20 miles.  they all headed in the direction of Concord before heading quickly to the right out of our site.  We tried to take video and one picture of the one that flew above us but the video just looks like a white light.  No sound at all!;43.1403;-71.5444
