An object seemed to come from the north, lower than the moon, and then disintegrate before reaching the ground, like a piece of mylar burning up.  It was silver with possible rows of rivets holding angular sheets of metal together.  It sounded like a ‘whoosh” as it disintegrated.  It seemed to disappear just before reaching the ground.;42.9768;-71.9819
