Dimmer light rapidly triangles brighter one, (directly above me), joins brighter light, strobes, and streaks dimly out/away.;2001-07-17 22:00:00;3 seconds;Dimmer light rapidly triangles brighter one, (directly above me), joins brighter light, strobes, and streaks dimly out/away. I had just come home from work, went over to the window and looked up, as I might commonly do.  I saw two stars slightly bright, close together.  One was brighter than the other.  Just as I was thinking, That must be the aligned planets the weather man mentioned the night before, the less bright light did a very rapid triangle around the brighter one, then seemed to join it, then it strobed, maybe 4-10 times the brightness and size and then a brief, dim shooting-star like streak almost straight out/up.   The whole thing, from first noticing the two lights to nothing was maybe 3 seconds or less.   At first I thought it was two crafts, but then after some research, I figured it was just the lights on one triangular one, but who knows.   I was sober, have perfect vision, acute mental capacity and grip on reality.  I was a teacher, now a registered cardiac nurse.  I saw nothing in the paper, didn't bother reporting it until now, when I'm just getting around to reporting a similar incident back in May of this year, (2015)  5/21, or within a few days of that date.;43.2524666666667;-70.8684083333333
