Very large craft with intense bright lights.;2020-09-12 04:45:00;2 minutes;Very large craft with intense bright lights I was on my porch when I looked up and saw a huge rectangular craft going from a northwest to southeast direction.  There were 6 intense bright lights , 3 lights on each side of the craft.  There was no sound and I observed the craft for about half minute going at the same speed and all of a sudden it moved at a very high rate of speed and then slowed down.  My neighbors roof obstructed  my line of vision momentarily.  I moved off my deck to visualize the craft again for around 10 seconds and it took off again at a very high rate of speed and it was gone.  The early morning sky was clear and many stars were present.  I canâ€™t emphasized enough on the size of this object.  It was huge.;43.2524666666667;-70.8684083333333
