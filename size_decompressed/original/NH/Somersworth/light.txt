Weird group of red lighted flying objects that appeared to be in a formation.;2012-02-01 20:28:00;2 minutes;Weird group of red lighted flying objects that appeared to be in a formation. Was pulling into my driveway and noticed 5 or 6 red objects that looked like they were in a circle in the sky behind my home, after backing in they proceeded to fly by to the left and it looked like there was one in the front and then the other three crafts that followed were fairly close to each other behind it in the same direction, there was one in the back as well that trailed behind a couple thousand feet.  I wanted to run inside  to grab my husband to ask him what he thought they could have been.  I couldn't make out the shape of them but they all had one big red light, not blinking.

I was looking at the stars as usual and pointing out the planets to myself when I noticed what looked like a very bright star but it was flashing and remained very still, which led me to believe it was just a star.  After about 3 minutes I noticed it started to move, it stayed in the same general area but it zig zagged left and right, up and down for the next ten to fifteen minutes before I went inside.;43.2524666666667;-70.8684083333333
