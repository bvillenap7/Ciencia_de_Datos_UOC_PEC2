From my observation it seem as the ufo was As I slowed down to pull my camera out I noticed it was vertical tilted at and angle to where all the lights where pointed towards me, I was unable to make out the details of the what it looked like exaclty I started record it for about 30 seconds before I had to keep driving due to a car coming up from behind. Due to my research there is no dount is was a ufo, in the video I recorded you can see that it was just hovering there if it were an airplane I would have only had a couple of seconds before it would have descended to land & from the video evidence I have you can see that it didn’t descend but since it was so dark you can only see the lights in the video.! I’m only reporting this to see if anyone else seen the same one.;43.2524666666667;-70.8684083333333
