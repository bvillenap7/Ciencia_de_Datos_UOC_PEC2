Ball of flame that appeared to prepare to land!;2009-09-14 08:32:00;1 to 2 mins;Ball of flame that appeared to prepare to land! I was standing on my back porch, and noticed a big flame type of object in the sky.  I called my family out to view it, and they were able to actually make it oustside, and see what I saw.  The object came closer to the tree line, and all of a sudden two streams of light projected from the bottom as if it was preparing to land. i'm not sure as to what we witnessed, but it appeared to be an aircraft on fire or something else.  My wife ran out with our video camera, but by that time it was below the treeline.  I have never in my life witnessed such a thing!  It seemed like 50, 100 or more miles out from us.  It was undeterminable as to what the distance actually was.  It seemed awfully close!!!;43.2524666666667;-70.8684083333333
Two orange fireballs seen moving silently across the night sky in Somersworth, NH.;2014-12-31 22:45:00;10 minutes;Two orange fireballs seen moving silently across the night sky in Somersworth, NH. A single orange light moved slowly and silently across the sky and disappeared behind some trees.   Minutes later a second ball of orange light moved along the same path, but stopped before the tree line.  It hung in that spot for about a minute before it faded out of visibility as if on a dimmer switch.   The lights were approximately four or five times the size of the North Star.   There were three adult witnesses, myself included. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.2524666666667;-70.8684083333333
