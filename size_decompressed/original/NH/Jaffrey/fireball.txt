Brilliant white and blue fireball over Jaffrey , NH at 1:25am;2006-10-14 01:25:00;10sec;Brilliant white and blue fireball over Jaffrey , NH at 1:25am I work 3rd shift, and while I was on break, about 1:25am , I went to get a cup of coffee. I was traveling west on RT.124 in Jaffrey NH, when I saw the reflection of a bright light off the hood of my car. I immediatly looked up to see a bright white and blue fireball, traveling from south to north. Basicly crossing over the road i was on. Nobody else was on break at the time, so i cant say wether any one else saw it. It lasted mabee 10 seconds and looked as if it were burning up. It had a trail or tail at the time i saw it but everything disapeered at the same time. It had a bright white center with blue at the edges and very large.;42.8192;-72.0223
