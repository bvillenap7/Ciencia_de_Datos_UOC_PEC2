Black disc to the North/NW of Keene;2013-07-30 15:15:00;5-10 minutes;black disc to the North/NW of Keene I witnessed a black disc shaped object to the North/North-West of Keene, NH.  The object was moving at a high rate of speed in the opposite direction of the clouds.  It looked like it was at an altitude of approximately 600-700 ft.  The object left behind no contrails and was moving way too quickly to be a prop-plane.;42.9628452914797;-72.2928313901349
