I was driving on the highway leaving keene and I saw a low flying craft that had four lights, three white ones on each of the triangles points and a blinking red one underneath.  I don't know if it was a plane or what, I just get a feeling that it wasn't.  It was moving, at a regular pace, just king of moving along.  The flat edge of the triangle was at the front and the point with the white light was at the back. My husband was with me but he was sleeping.;42.9628452914797;-72.2928313901349
