Oval light over preserve in Keene, NH.;2014-12-29 16:50:00;2 minutes;Oval light over Preserve in Keene. I was driving home around sunset on Rt. 12, heading south, when I noticed a bright light over the Horatio Colony Nature Preserve in Keene.  The oval shaped light was wider than a star and brighter.  It also had rotating flashing lights.  It continued to hover there as I approached Rt. 9. I turned onto Rt. 9, heading west, and could still see the object, which was just over the tree line.  As I sat at the traffic light located at the entrance to the Monadnock Marketplace, the object rose up several feet but continued to hover in the same spot.  The traffic light changed color and I had to drive off.  The object disappeared from sight behind the trees.;42.9628452914797;-72.2928313901349
