Shiny metallic object passed over my house.;2020-08-01 17:50:00;1 minute;Shiny metallic object passed over my house. I was looking out my kitchen window, its really clear and sunny.  I seen a very metallic, shiny object slowly moving through the air, high altitude.  I could tell it was not a plane.  It looked like a ball.  I thought it may have been a balloon, however it was very slow, then picked up a bit of speed the slowed down again.  It was not normal.  I took a video but my camera isn't that clear.  I made snap shots of the video and made the resolution bigger.  I posted it to my face book.  It traveled a straight line and did not stray for the entire time I witnessed it.;42.9628452914797;-72.2928313901349
