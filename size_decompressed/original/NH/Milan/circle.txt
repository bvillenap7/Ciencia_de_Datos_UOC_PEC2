I called my husband to come out and see this.  The two light started to move jointly toward us slowly, and then they both stopped.  After a short period of time then started to move, reversing direction and started moving left and away from us, at the same time, very slowly.  The lights stopped and then started to move slowly until the one on the left disappeared and then the one on the right disappeared.
