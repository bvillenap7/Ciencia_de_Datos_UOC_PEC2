A strange, hovering craft making sharp turns.;1989-05-15 14:00:00;2-3 minutes;A strange, hovering craft making sharp turns. I was 19 and lying in bed looking out of the window into the night sky when I saw a small flashing light come into view. My immediate thought was that it was a helicopter because I knew of no other aircraft that could hover in one spot like it was doing. Suddenly it began to move. It traveled down at an angle towards the left then it abruptly stoped again. It hovered for a moment then, as if making a V shape, it moved upwards to the left, stoped and hovered once more. I then got up from my bed, scared, to retrieve my father who was sleeping down the hall. Half way to his bed room I stopped and thought he would think I was crazy, so I went back to see if it was my imagination. It was still there hovering when I went to the window, I watched it for a few more seconds before it sped to the right, out of view. I am 33 now and it is something I don't talk about often, but I will never forget it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));43.0584;-71.4578
