Seen all over the US.;2014-02-03 19:00:00;10 minutes;Seen all over the US I walked out the door of my shop in Auburn, New Hampshire, around 7:00 pm this evening and looked in the direction of the moon that was just barely visible due to overcast sky.  Directly below the moon there was a formation of 50-100 reddish/orange spheres moving around slowly in random order.   After a couple of moments they started to disappear until finally 2 of them seemed to rotate around each other and drift off into the distance towards Weir, NH.;43.0584;-71.4578
