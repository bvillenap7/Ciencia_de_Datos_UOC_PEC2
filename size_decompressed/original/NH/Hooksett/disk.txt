A few scary sighting by two seperate groups of people at two different times.;2001-12-10 17:30:00;my husband says a few min;A few scary sighting by two seperate groups of people at two different times. My husband and I went for a walk before dinner on a new development road next to our house.  It was starting to get dark out.  We live in a very wooded area and it was snowing lightly.  There was a light breeze. Then as we walked the clouds seemed to seperate and there was an almost scary silence. You could see the stars!  We continued walking and my husband stopped and said, LOOK I turned my head to see this terrifying large glowing white object hover above the trees making no noise at all.  As a matter of fact We could hear nothing. It was gliding through the tree tops slowly. I remember standing there and couldn't take my eyes off of it.  I feel like we stood there for a half an hour or so.  My husband said, it felt like an instant.  When I had realized what we saw I wanted to run.  Run where my husband said. We went home very startled, and I had called the police asking if anyone had reported anything unusual and had explained what we saw. We went to our neighbors and asked if they had seen anything. I wasn't sure about UFO's until this.  My four children have also seen something.  I find it very scary and my children to this day are still having nightmares and will not go outside alone. We don't so much is let out children watch wrestling. My husband and I did not tell our children about our encounter and what they say was very different.  They ran in the house one day crying and screaming saying, there was something in the sky changing shape and chasing them.  I have four children that saw the same thing.;43.0584;-71.4578
