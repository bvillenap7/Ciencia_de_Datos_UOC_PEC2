Black Triangle gliding over RT 93;2009-10-26 06:05:00;20 minutes;Black Triangle gliding over RT 93 Driving northbound on Rt. 93 at approx 6:05am I saw what looked like a shooting star.  Glancing upwards to get a closer look and maybe see another shooting star, to my surprise instead I saw a black triangle gliding southbound about 50 to 75 ft in the sky.  There were 3 circular lights on the bottom of the triangle which was equilateral in shape.  The 3 circles were glowing very dimly and were not radiating much light.  The Triangle was very dark in color and I would have totally missed it if it wasn’t for the shooting star.  I believe that the shooting star may have actually come out of the triangle shaped object, but I can’t be sure since it happened so fast. A few other strange facts about what I witnessed:  The shooting star appeared to shoot sideways and even a little upward which I have never seen before with a shooting star.  Also the same night about 15-20 minutes later I saw two bright stars to the bottom left of the constellation Orion.  These stars seemed out of place and were pretty close to one another.  I tried keeping my eyes on the two stars but trees blocked my view since I was driving through a forested area.  Once I broke past the forested area the two stars were gone.  This all happened within a 30 second period from first noticing the stars and to them disappearing. I have to think that someone else must have seen this too since I was not the only vehicle on the highway at the time.

Three triangular craft, no lights or sound, flying about 150 feet from each other in a straight line. ,;2012-03-10 19:30:00;2 minutes;Three triangular craft, no lights or sound, flying about 150 feet from each other in a straight line. , no lights, just reflection on the bottom of the craft from the lights on the highway, south of the hooksett tolls above I93, just above the tree line, flying over the center of the highway... headed south.  I put down my window as one was above me... didn't hear any noise but highway traffic and wind... three craft flying about 150 feet from each other in a straight line. I am a photographer and graphic artist in my mid 40's.  I have never seen anything like this shape in the sky before.  seemed strange they were so low, and did not appear to be going more than 35 mph...;43.0584;-71.4578
Very Thin Flashes of Light and Triangular Object.;2012-11-17 19:23:00;30 seconds;Very Thin Flashes of Light and Triangular Object. My husband and I were driving home from work on I-93. Just before we reached the Hooksett Toll Booth, I saw some very thin flashes of light in the sky ahead of us, occuring every couple of seconds. I passed I off as being light reflecting on wires. I moved my head to try to get a better view when the next one flashed and my husband asked, “Did you see that, too?”  I told him I had seen several and told him it was just car lights reflecting on the wires and he pointed out to me that there were no wires on that part of the highway. When we saw one more, I leaned forward and looked upward, through the windshield. What I saw was a triangular shape with a distinct circle on each “corner” (three circles in all). There was no light emitting from under the craft and it blended in with the night sky (almost appearing transparent).  It moved very quickly in a southerly direction.;43.0584;-71.4578
