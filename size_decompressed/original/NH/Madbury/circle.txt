It sounded like an airplane until it became louder, then blue flash to wite. Heard what sounded like the hiss and ruble of a plane, soft at first, then slowly becoming deeper and more.  My cat freaked out, and at that point, as I was looking up from my bed I saw a blue light linger in the sky through my translucent shades.  After about 30 seconds, I got up to see what it was.  I saw a large blue circle flash to white and move swiftly across the sky.  Scared me so much, I couldn’t believe what I had seen.;43.1766;-70.9393
