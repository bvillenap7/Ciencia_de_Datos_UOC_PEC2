Well I took it as a planet, or maybe a star. It looked just like a star but 2 or 3 times bigger. It did not belong there, i took astronomy and it looked out of place It had no movement. So i went home and took it as a planet But the next night I saw the same thing, at about the same time. I was driving by the horse farm and I stopped my car. I was looking at it dead on and the thing disapeared right in front of me. It wasn't a cloud, just gone. Like someone just put a blanket over it. It did not appear to Shoot off. Sighting number 2---- 3/19/03- My brother said he came home and on oriens belt the 3 stars looked like they were dimly flashing red and blue. To the naked eye they looked lik stars keep in mind. But he said the moved, down then up. As far as I know planets and stars dont disapear and move up. I saw the stars. But They didn't move. But I would have sworn that they looked like they had some type of drift. Faintly moving. One other thing. With the orang glow sighting. I saw jets fly by the same area. 3 or so of them.... Mmmmm. Not planes...JETS...;43.1766;-70.9393
