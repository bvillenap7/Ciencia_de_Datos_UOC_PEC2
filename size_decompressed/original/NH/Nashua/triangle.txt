Low hovering triangular aircraft, fast speed and tight turns.;2015-08-29 00:00:00;2-3 seconds;low hovering triangular aircraft, fast speed and tight turns. I saw a triangle,  directly above where I used to live in Pine Hill.  Unsure of the time,  but it wasn't too late.   Went to smoke a cig outside, and there was this triangular aircraft hovering very low over the trees of my complex.  I looked at it for a moment,  before it turned 90 degrees and sped away.  I thought it was some sort of military harrier since I lived near the airport, the experience was bizzare.  I thought to myself tonight if anyone else had seen it before.  Googled it,  and that's how I found this site.;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
I saw a brown triangular object fly at a low altitude and ridiculously high speed.;2015-08-29 17:30:00;1-2 seconds;I saw a brown triangular object fly at a low altitude and ridiculously high speed. I was looking out of my window, only to see the craft fly from roughly a quarter mile away, to over the horizon in about a second.  It seemed brown in color and flew at a relatively low altitude, as it is a very cloudy day and I could distinctly see the object below the cloud barrier.  I live on the top floor of an apartment building that's on top of a hill, and can see a very far distance from my window.  No plane or jet could go as fast and fly at such a low altitude as the object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Triangle craft with lights underneath, hovering in place.;2015-09-25 19:30:00;1 minute;Triangle craft with lights underneath, hovering in place. I was driving and to my left, saw a triangle shaped object with 3 lights underneath - hovering in place, about the same distance as a low flying plane.  It was large, and perfectly symmetrical.  No forward movement for at least 30 seconds.  It then started to slowly move, as I drove by a building and lost sight of it. The next evening, a Facebook friend wrote of an account he had just witnessed, in the same town.  He spoke of a triangle object, with three yellow lights underneath, about a mile up, and the size of a football field just hovering in place.  He ran into his home to show his wife, and when he came out, it had vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Large triangle-shaped object hovering over highway;2016-05-03 00:15:00;30-45 seconds;Large triangle-shaped object hovering over highway At about 12:15am, while traveling North on Everett Turnpike in Nashua near exit 4 I could see 2 white lights in the sky, accompanied by a blinking red light, above the overpass at exit 5, around a mile away.  I immediately assumed it was a plane, since most planes I've seen have white lights and some sort of blinking light on the bottom.  As I got closer to exit 5, I noticed the object was not flying east-west or north-south like an airplane, but was instead hovering high above the overpass at exit 5.  As I got even closer, I expected to see the object prove to be a helicopter, perhaps a police helicopter, with it being so close to the Nashua Police department.  Right before I went under the overpass at exit 5 I rolled down my window and got a good look at the object.  It was a dark brown or black colored triangle (not a boomerang shape) with two white lights on each side of all three points of the triangle (almost like quotation mark! s), as well as a red blinking light that blinked about once per second not directly in the center of the bottom of the object, but a little left of center of the bottom.  I also considered it possible that this was a drone, since I have one and am familiar with how they look in the night sky.  But once I came out from under the overpass, I was in total amazement at how big and close it was to me.  It was enourmous, and it was absolutely not a drone or a plane.  I estimate it's size to between a large truck and a fighter jet.  The object emitted no sound that I could hear.  I also saw at least two cars pulled over on the highway, the occupants trying to film the night sky, one on each side of the highway.  I was not the only one who saw this craft.;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
Triangle shaped object hovering near highway.  ((anonymous report));2017-10-06 21:00:00;5 minutes;Triangle shaped object hovering near highway. Saw bright white light low in the sky driving southbound on Everett Turnpike near exit 5. When we drove closer we noticed the light was not moving.  As we drove by we noticed it was a black solid triangle shaped object that was hovering at a slight angle.  There were red and greenish blue lights blinking around the outside edges of the triangle.  The bright white light came from the center.  We reversed direction at the next exit and drove back to exit 5.  The object was now farther away and hovered just below the tree line for about 5 minutes, before disappearing.

Boomerang flying object. Amherst St to Sullivan St.;2018-10-28 20:00:00;1 minute;Boomang flying object. Amherst st to sullivan st. I was on Amherst St., about to turn right onto Sullivan St..  I saw lights similar to an airplane, but the shape of the flying object was like a boomerang and the lights were different sizes, colors, and brightness.  The colors were white, yellow, & red.   The two big red lights were on each end.  The others were all down the inner side of the boomerang.  As I continued down Sullivan St. to Broad St.., I said to my son look at that thing in the sky.  By that point it had lowered itself into a bunch if trees.  We could still see lights but nothing else.  I turned around at this point but was not able to find the flying object again.  There was a house were the object lowered itself.  The object was about half the length of the house.  Looked thin but powerful.;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
