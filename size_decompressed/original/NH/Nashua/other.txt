Triangular craft terrorizes radio waves;2005-08-02 02:35:00;20-25min;Triangular craft terrorizes radio waves I am a 3rd shift security supervisor for a government facility. Firstly I'm not crazy. I know what we saw. The other guys were just as astonished as I, but less reconciliable about WHAT exactly these lights were.  At approximately 02:15 I began my nightly exterior perimeter patrol of the building, insuring all doors are locked, the cyclone wire fence hasn't been obviously breached anywhere and that the site is basically safe.  Somewhere near the southeast corner of the building a light in the sky caught my eye. Though an airfield is nearby, it doesn't operate at night still though, at first the light was nondescript and creepy--like the way a jetliner looks head on from a distance. Anyone who knows what I mean knows the lights of these are bright, there is no or little sound and the illusion of hovering or slow moving. I thought nothing of it really, just another jet. . . I made my way around to the building's northeast corner as usual, and had forgotten about the jet. As I approached guard post at the facility's main traffic gate, I saw my guard outside, looking at what I thought was the jet still. I looked again and knew why he was so stupefied the light was a lot closer now, and was definitely bigger than a jet's headlights. We both mumbled something to the effect of What the heck is that? and watched the triangular?--shape as it drifted toward the building.  The intensity of the lighting made it's exact hull outline impossible to see. I am guessing that it was no farther than five or six hundred feet away, over an area of woods and highway (I think. I know beyond the cyclone fence is just woods). As we watched, the triangularish craft jerked to the left, then back some, and then to the right. It's light was no longer so bright, or not pointing in our direction anymore, and we both made out what appeared to be a bank of < shaped lights that pulsed a dark red from dim to moderately bright and back to dim again. Shafts of white light seemed to poke out from the underside of the craft occasionally. At several points during the 'flight', it had maneuvered so that we could see that indeed the shape was triangular and a brighter or more intense light lit each of the triangle points' underside. An inbuond vehicle stopped at the main gate and the driver got out, watching just as we were. Though I only counted once, the others said they saw twice, maybe three times, small red spheres falling to the ground, spiralling in a slow descent like oak seeds would. This went on for some minutes until finally something seemed to explode on the ground below the craft. But not like an explosion you'd expect. It was a loud crackling zap accompanied by a brief white light. After that the craft slowly hovered around in the area some more, as it had been before the small red spheres came down. After only a few more minutes the thing took off and disappeared out of sight. My guard began processing the driver and I decided to go back around to the corner where I first saw the light. I have one fear in life and it isn't UFOs or aliens, but I must admit as I approached the building's dark backside I became very nonsensically afraid. The fence was not breached anywhere that I could see, but it didn't make me feel much safer. The last detail I have to report is a strange staticky noise that overcame my radio as I approached the corner closest to the incident, and after only a few moments drained the nearly full battery (8 hours of charge left). It also broke my watch which I found later had stopped at 02:52, which is approximately the time I'm guessing I was in the area. People inside and at other guards posts had complained about an abundance of static for a few minutes, though it hadn't lasted very long. Two hours later, as the sun was beginning to lighten the sky, I went back around the building with a newly charged battery and experienced what I believed to be a small bit of excess static, but nothing like before. The three of us have decided not to tell anyone at work, and I only tell you know because the truth should be known.;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
3 red lights on semi-circular craft moving VERY FAST on 10/30/08 at ~8:30pm in the SE sky over Nashua, NH.;2008-10-30 20:30:00;2-3 minutes;3 red lights on semi-circular craft moving VERY FAST on 10/30/08 at ~8:30pm in the SE sky over Nashua, NH. My husband and I were watching TV at about 8:30 on 10/30/08 and we heard the roar of supersonic jet engines over our rooftop.  We went to the front porch to see what it was and instead our eyes were drawn to a fast moving semi-circular set of 3 blinking lights on something that was moving VERY FAST, horizontally,  in the southeast sky.  The blinking lights appeared to be below the craft.  It was pitch black outside and difficult to see above the blinking lights. We were spooked when it dropped sharply and vertically below the tree line.  We went back inside and again heard the roar of the jet engines.  I spoke with my neighbor about it and he said military jets were in our neighborhood last night.  He's an airplane mechanic at a military base nearby.  He did not come out to check it out because he recognized the jet engine sound.;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176

Low slow moving octagon shaped object having five white lights on bottom viewed from skylight.;2016-03-02 03:00:00;4 to 5 seconds;Low slow moving octagon shaped object having five white lights on bottom viewed from skylight It was around two or three in the morning.  I had just come back up the stairs to my bedroom to try and get some sleep.    As I was getting into bed, a bright white light suddenly came shining down thru the skylight that is positioned a few feet above my bed.  Startled by the sudden illumination, I turned to look up to see what was causing it.  I was very surprized to see a large, dark object directly above our house.  It seemed to be flying low, only maybe three to five hundred feet.    As it moved across the frame of the skylight I was able to make out the shape as  being octagonal and that there were five, large white lights I could see as well.  These lights appeared to be flush with the bottom surface of the octagonal shape I was veiwing.  They were positioned one in the middle and the remaining four adjacent to each angled corner of the octagon.  The lights were round and appeared to be similiar in size and brightness.    The object was completely quiet except for a low sound that seemed to come from within it.  Had I not been directly below the window and paying attention I might not have caught this.   The sound was not at all familiar as that which might be generated by a helicopter or other aircraft and the object was far too large to be any kind of drone.   The lights that might be found standard on a heliocopter or airplane were not to be seen on the object.    The whole incident took  perhaps just a few seconds;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
