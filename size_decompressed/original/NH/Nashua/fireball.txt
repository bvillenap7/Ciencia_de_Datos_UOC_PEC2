Bright green fireball seen falling across sky in Nashua, NH.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));2013-01-23 18:00:00;3 seconds;Bright green fireball seen falling across sky in Nashua, NH. I was driving along Route 3 when I saw a bright green fireball come into view.  It was falling at a roughly 33 degree angle to the West and the visual lasted for around 3 seconds.  There were other cars on the highway and the sky was very dark and very clear, so others must have seen it as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
Bright red light moving slowly and then fading away.  Three green lights in the same area.;2013-09-28 22:30:00;2 minutes;Bright red light moving slowly and then fading away.  Three green lights in the same area. Saw a bright red object moving very slowly in an eastward direction - it stopped and hovered (very high in the sky, yet still very bright) and then began moving north east and started to fade until it eventually disappeared.  as it was moving north east a bright green light began to move in the opposite direction, stopped, and then when i pulled out some binoculars i saw two similar but dimmer objects positioned off to its southwest.   the red one was gone by this point and the other three just sat there.  eventually I lost track of all of them after I spent some time searching the sky for the red one to reappear.  I know this sounds crazy, but there was no noise, the objects were moving much too slowly to be aircraft or a meteor, and the lights did not appear to be airplane lights as they were solid and even when the direction changed on the red one it only appeared red (my father is a pilot and said that you would be able to see the green light on the oppos! ite wing after a direction change).;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
Emerald green fireball shooting across sky;2016-09-21 21:42:00;15 seconds;Emerald green fireball shooting across sky Driving north on Route 3, between exits 6 and 8 in Nashua, NH, an emerald green fireball light was shooting through the sky from east to west.  There was a trail of the green light behind it and a mix of green and white haze around the object.  Several people appeared to have seen it as well, as drivers on the highway were hitting their breaks.  As it was shooting across the sky it appeared to dissipate quickly.  The speed of the fireball was pretty fast, the entire encounter lasted approximately 15 seconds.;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
