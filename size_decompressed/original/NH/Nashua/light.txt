Object that appeared to be a stationary star flies away when pointed at.  ((anonymous report));2018-03-01 03:50:00;~1 minute;Object that appeared to be a stationary star flies away when pointed at. Sometime around 3:00 to 5:00 am, I want to say around 3:50, me and my borther stepped outside my house for a cigarette,  he noted that the moon was huge and and odd color, and I noticed that there were two stars in the sky, the only visible ones, that were lined up pretty much perfectly from our point of view,   I thought this was odd and so I pointed at the one on the right and as I did it started moving around a little bit which I then jokingly dismissed as random eye motion, as I finished saying this it took off slowly but at a steady pace across the entire sky all the way out of sight behind my roof.  Needless to say its appearance was indistinguishable from a normal star unless there was two of them.  I didn't bother pursuing this any further as it was rather disconcerting and I've been having other odd things occurring lately.

Bright, stationary object in sky over Nashua, NH.  ((anonymous report));2018-05-16 04:50:00;>1;Bright, stationary object in sky over Nashua, NH. I was getting out of bed just before 5 a.m.  The window and window shade were open.  I glanced out the window and saw a very bright, stationary object off to the west of Hudson, NH.  I remarked to my husband that there was a very bright star in the sky, which I assumed was a planet, and I said I had never seen one so bright.  I am used to seeing the planet Venus as a bright star, but this was at least 5 times, or more, larger than that.  He looked at it and said it was like something he had encountered as a teenager and described as a UFO.  He laid back down and I got up to go into the next room and when I looked out that window, it was gone.  Neither one of us saw it leave, but it had disappeared.;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
