Two cigar-shaped craftes skip across out atmosphere in a very swift and silent motion.;2012-03-22 21:05:00;6 seconds;two cigar shaped craftes skip across out atmosphere in a very swift and silent motion. i looked up at the planets that are in my western sky i believe, and as i glanced to the left these two crafts moving very swiftly started by, these looked a lot like the belly of a plane but without wings, no lights nothing just a maroon hue (slight glow) they moved so fast I did not want to take my eyes off of them. they stayed parallel for the entire time they were in the sky.  No noise, and strange thing was, they appeared to move in a slight arch, as if they were skimming our atmosphere.  They just looked out of place;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
Entire fusalage had a red glow no engine sounds at all.;2015-09-27 22:00:00;1-2 minutes;Entire fusalage had a red glow no engine sounds at all. September 27, 2015 approx. 8pm. We were watching the eclipse, when a bright red oblong shape flew heading from south to north. It was just above the tree tops as our eyes were facing east towards the moon. This is typical flight path for aircraft in and out of Nashua airport.  We didn’t think anything of it until we noticed it was all red.  There was no marker or landing lights. As it flew by, we were trying to identify it and we were waiting for sound to see if it was a jet or a prop. There was no sound at all. Normally we hear everything. Not only are we on the flight path to Nashua Airport, but, commercial flights going into Manchester will go over my house also. I normally do not write in, but, I read there was a sighting in Lowell, MA, and a sighting in Bedford, NH.  Nashua is in-between Lowell and Bedford. I spent 10 years in the military, 4 active duty Air Force at a base with U2’s and SR71’s.  Never saw anything like this. The event time from beginning to end was 1-2 minutes;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
Saw silver cigar shape object flying low with no exhaust trailing then disappeared into clear sky. ((anonymous report));2017-09-29 12:00:00;15 seconds;Saw silver cigar shape object flying low with no exhaust trailing then disappeared into clear sky I was walking around noon during lunch in Nashua, NH, near the Mass state line.  I was walking at an elevation looking eastward.  I could see for several miles over the Merrimack River and into Hudson NH.   As I looked east, I saw a silver cigar shape object flying low and I thought it was a low flying plane, but there was no exhaust trailing behind, so I thought that was a little odd.  I would estimate it was a couple miles away.   I watched it slowly fly low for about 15 seconds, and then it suddenly disappeared.   There were no clouds in the area where it was flying and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

This object was massive!!;2020-07-28 22:00:00;7 minutes;This object was massive!! Sitting in my car, it was 10pm July, 28 2020. Looking in southern direction, in South Nashua NH I observed two lights, at the front green and the rear was white.  This object moved as one unit. I heard no sound, and walked across the parking lot starring at it. The scale of this object would make it massive.  The distance from front to rear would make this object huge!  Left my site heading North along the NH Everett turnpike.;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
