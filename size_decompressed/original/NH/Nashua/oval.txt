Sitting over river.;1992-04-01 03:00:00;10 minutes;Huge oval craft with windows and colored lights running along the bottom of it.  No noise.  Sitting over river. It was HUGE.  I estimate 3 football fields in length and 3 stories high.  It was sitting still above the tree line at the back of my neighborhood over the Nashua river.  It made no noise.  It had no apparent engines or flames or anything.  It was shiny – the craft was illuminated by the reflection from a full moon.  It was a very clear night.  About where the “2nd” story would be there was a row of what seemed like windows with an ivory light illuminating from them.  All along the bottom were colored lights (various colors).  I worked for the Air Force at the time as a contractor.  I know my planes VERY well.  This was not anything we have.  I held a security clearance at the time too and feared I would loose it if I came forward with type of information.  I believe I lost about 10 minutes of time.  When I first saw it the clock in my car said 3:00 a.m. and the next thing I remember it said it was 3:10 a.m.  I didn't tell anyone about it, but the next two mornings in a row my daughter (who was only 6 at the time) said she saw a Lady in my room during the night and she couldn't wake me up.

What was the Airforce chasing?;2003-02-27 05:00:00;4 Minutes;What was the Airforce chasing? Every moring,around five o'clock, I take my two dogs for a walk before I go to work.  I am a believer, that we are being visited by something, not of this earth.  I watch the skies whenever I can for anything strange.  Usually I see a satellite or two, traveling a straight and steady path, at a constant speed, from one horizon to the other.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  On Thursday morning, February 27, 2003, I was amazed to see the following:  Two objects traveling one behind the other, a good distance apart, at a low altitude.(About the height a small, two-man airplane would fly.)  There was no sound that I could detect and the objects maintained a steady glow - no blinking lights.  Above the objects and around the objects, at a much higher altitude were approximately twelve other objects that I thought were Airforce jets.  They maneuvered like jets and had blinking lights that pulsated regularly.  The jets seemed to be circling the two other objects, but keeping a distance.  I watched this spectacle for about four minutes until they disappeared to the north.  I am curious to know if anyone else saw what I saw.  Before I saw this spectacle, the lights on the interior of my locked car were on when I was at the top of my stairway with my two dogs.  As I walked down the stairs, towards the car, the lights went out.  I believe that the two objects passing over my house may have been responsible for the lights malfunction.  Also, I live less than a mile from the Federal Aviation Administrations traffic control center in Nashua, NH.;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
