UFO sighting in Nashua NH, 02/03/2013;2013-02-04 19:36:00;Seconds;UFO sighting in Nashua NH, 02/03/2013 At 7:36 pm tonight I saw a UFO.  It was off exit 6.  I saw what looked like a plane traveling from the east but as it got closer I realized it was in the shape of a diamond and had lights on the left side.   It hovered for several seconds.  I then saw another object moving toward the UFO.  I thought it was a plane that might hit it but it stopped and hovered next to UFO.  It was a lot smaller then other one.  I got off the next exit so I could go back to exit 6.  When I got back to that area the larger UFO was still there!  I went back again but it was then gone.  It was large and definitely in the shape of a diamond.  It hovered for several seconds!;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
