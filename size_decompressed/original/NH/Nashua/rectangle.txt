My husband gone to a friend’s house and I was home alone on this warm summer evening.  I had put out a lawn chair out on the back porch of our town house to relax and look at the sky, the highway and mall lights in a distance.  It was a clear nice night you could see the stars really well.  I guess you could say I was looking out north to north east sky.  While looking at the sky…its weird and hard to describe…I knew something “black” was gliding slowly by the sky kind of over the highway heading North Westward (from me it was about 2 to 3 football fields away).  The only reason I knew there was something there going by was because it blocked out the stars as it went.  I knew it couldn’t be a cloud…I’m guessing it was a rectangle or a triangle shape but it was hard to tell.  No lights…just “void” or black and no sound.  After thinking about it for a while…it was heading in the direction toward a local airport…as it disappeared out of sight. VERY strange and scared me I went back into the house.
