South east Nashua sightings;2016-10-15 23:00:00;15 minutes;south east Nashua sightings there were 7 to 8 right orange orbs in the sky in a somewhat vertical line.  As we were driving, we were trying to find a better place to see these.  When I looked out the back window it looked as if they were three or four in  formation.  Because we drove a little further we were pretty sure we weren't looking up three of them..  We turned the corner we saw one.  And then just like that everything was gone.  We drove around the area and stopped in the parking lot to see if we would see anything else.  But they were gone;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
