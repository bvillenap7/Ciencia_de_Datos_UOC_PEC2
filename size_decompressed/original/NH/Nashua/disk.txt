Saucer shaped object;1977-07-01 23:00:00;15min;Saucer shaped object This info was from my father, who recently passed away.  He was in Nashua by Dunkin Donuts on Canal St and when he came outside he noticed a number of people staring at the sky.  He told me there was no sound and the object was several hunderd feet above the ground.  He said there was one red light on the botton and what appeared to be a row of rotating windows with a very bright white light.  He said there were several witnesses, although there was nothing in the papers.  About 6 months later, maybe even 1.5 yrs later he was xmas shopping at the mall of NH in manchester and when he came out of Lechemere's he looked up and the same craft was hovering just above the trees maybee 200 feet up.

Circular craft with rotating pulsating lights on the sides only;2002-04-16 22:24:00;3-4 seconds;Circular craft with rotating pulsating lights on the sides only It seemed to be a circular disk that had pulsating lights on both sides that definately seemed to alternate sides and make a circular motion, however there were no lights in the front or back (the direction it was traveling and behind it).  It traveled a large distance in 3-4 seconds, which is the entire duration of what I saw and traveled the distance of maybe 30 full moons. It traveled in a straight line and seemed to vanish.  I pointed it out to my wife as soon as I saw it and she saw it also and confirmed there were pulsating lights.  At first I thought it was a meteor grazing the atmosphere, but when my wife said she saw the pulsating lights I had to keep an open mind.  I definately don't know what it was, but it seemed to be a craft, not a metoer.  Any other sightings in the New England area tonight?;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
Circular pulsating lights on sides of large, silent, disk shaped object;2002-04-16 22:24:00;3-4 seconds;Circular pulsating lights on sides of large, silent, disk shaped object I sent this last night, but I got a Server not responding error, Sorry if you get this twice. I was on my deck with my wife around 10:30pm last night and we were looking up at the stars, the little dipper in particular.  We were about to head back inside, when I saw something.  It was what seemed to be circular or disk shaped and had yellowish/orange lights that pulsated in a circular motion around the object.  However these lights were only on the sides of the object, not the front or back (not on the sides that were in front of or behind the direction the object was travelling).  There were about four or five panels of individual light on each side and went like I said in a clockwise direction around the object, with only one panel lit at one time. The object  was about the size of two full moons when the moon is high in the sky, and travelled about the distance of 30 full moons in 3-4 seconds.  It made no sound at all and almost appeared transluscent, the lights were the only things I saw.  There were no clouds at all in the area.  As soon as I noticed it, I pointed it out to my wife, who saw it immediately due to it's size.  She confirmed the lights were pulsating.  The object seemed to vanish into thin air, I had an unobstructed view in the direction it was travelling when it disappeared.  I am also very close (within 4 miles) to a small airport and the FAA tracking center for the East Coast.;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
