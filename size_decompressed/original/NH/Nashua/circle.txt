I looked up to the sky just as it was getting dark and saw a disk shaped object displaying multicolored lights in a circle on underside hovering over at what seemed to be 100 feet above us and the gathering crowd.  It stayed for 30 seconds and then shot off at an angle toward space in an instant it was gone.  It made no sound.The odd thing about it is that only one sister and myself recall the event.  The rest of my family,( 4 others), although i know they looked right at the object in wonder,can't remember seeing it. I also find it strange that only 2 other people, (that i have found,one on his site, )recall seeing something simular that week around the nashua area.I know for a fact multiple people saw this UFO.Has everyone forgotten????

8 to 12 Very bright round objects seen over Nashua, NH;2003-10-18 20:45:00;1 minute;8 to 12 Very bright round objects seen over Nashua, NH From Southern Nashua looking towards Tyngsborough, MA about 8 to 10 circular objects were traveling at a relatively normal speed.  The craft illuminated very brightly almost as if it were a reflection.  They did not seem to be burning up in the atmosphere like a re-entry, as they were travelling too slow. There were numerous colors of the reflection/blinking, like green, red and white and each object had a glow to it and you could see each one moving when they were not blinking/shining.  There was no apparent pattern to the shining, but was definately not the blinking of normal single engine plane or jet running lights or headlights.  The objects travelled from a westerly to easterly direction and seemed to vanish behind clouds and did not reappear when the clouds had passed.  There was a small engine plane directly overhead at the same time and was probably landing at Nashua airport around 8:50pm EST.  I could not find the number for the FAA tracking station or the airport tower both located in Nashua to see if they had seen what we did on radar.  The whole thing lasted about one minute, as my wife and I had time to call my In-laws outside to view the last 15-30 seconds when the objects disappeared behind the clouds.;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176

My wife called to me when she saw a large round bright orange object in the sky.   I went out my front door and watched the object slowly fly away.  The object was too large to be a helicopter or plane and was flying low in the sky.   It did not make any noise. ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date.;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176

A bright white light that would stop change positions then changed colors and quickly moved the complete opposite direction.;2015-09-06 21:20:00;90 seconds;A bright white light that would stop change positions then changed colors and quickly moved the complete opposite direction. I saw a bright white light moving at a slow speed, it stopped for about 5 seconds.  Then it traveled left for about 2 seconds stopped and stopped again.  It then continued straight for another 10 seconds then it stopped again.   After this it moved to my left yet again.  At this point I pointed it out to another person after about 7 seconds it turned bright red and moved in the complete opposite direction going backwards.  It was moving away very fast and seemed to decend quite a bit. It then turned back to a bright white color and then vanished.  This was my first time actually seeing anything I couldn't explain it was only one solid light so I ruled out a helicopter also it moved too fast to be one.  It made zero sound, its movement was very smooth, and I couldn't think of any type of aircraft that could just stop that quick and hover for such a long time.

Circular glowing craft, extremely fast.  ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the object is a commercial airliner, above a contrail.  PD));2016-08-14 19:00:00;20 minutes;Circular glowing craft, extremely fast. My girlfriend and I were exiting off the Nashua Everett Turnpike, towards the Nashua Police Station, when my girlfriend spotted a large, extremely white and brightly glowing circular craft in the sky.  It was moving extremely fast in a North-West direction, almost flying completely diagonally.  However it was way WAY too high up to be a plane, nor was it the shape of a plane.  We began filming and shortly after shutting the camera off, we completely lost sight of it as though it had disappeared. After this we went to swim nearby, further down West Hollis Street, near the Harley Davidson shop.  For the next 15 minutes, we continuously saw the same thing over and over. Perfectly circular, extremely white, and bright, craft, moving 5 times faster than any plane I've ever seen.  However, one of the crafts, instead of climbing diagonally, shot STRAIGHT UPWARDS.  And vanished.   After this we saw nothing else but it disappeared into thin air.  And so did the others. ((NUFORC Note:  We have made one attempt to contact the witness via telephone, but there was no answer at the number provided.  PD));42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
red/orange orb being pursued by large helicopter just above the trees;2016-10-15 19:40:00;30 seconds;red/orange orb being pursued by large helicopter just above the trees. Sighting on Saturday, October 15, 2016:  At approximately 7:40 PM EST I heard an extremely loud, very low-flying helicopter somewhere over the woods behind my apartment in southern Nashua. My wife and two sons were present, and we grew increasingly alarmed as it grew louder and louder.  My oldest son (14) and I stepped out onto the balcony to look for the helicopter – it sounded like it was practically on top of us, but too low and close to see it over the tree line.  It was dark, the full moon was still on the opposite horizon behind our building. My first thought was that it might be the police tracking someone on the ground in the woods, except this helicopter was SO loud – sounded more like a Black Hawk than the standard choppers that police/news uses.  And we couldn’t see searchlights of any kind over the woods. Suddenly we saw a reddish/orange light break over the tree line headed South.  Our balcony faces West and this light was running straight & perpendicular across our view.  It was a large orb shape, flying very fast in a perfectly straight line – skimming above the trees no more than a few hundred feet off the ground, and a few hundred yards from us.  We had a clear view of it for just a couple of seconds before it was lost behind the trees again.  It didn’t weave or change course, didn’t wobble, or change colors/size/shape.  There were no other lights on it, and it didn’t appear to pulse. Following just behind it was a large military helicopter which appeared to be pursuing the object.  The helicopter was large and dark colored, either black or gray with only a couple of small red lights on it and no visible markings that I could see. The orb appeared to accelerate slightly while it was in view but then backed off a bit, as if it was trying to stay just out of reach of the helicopter.  We had a clear view of both the object and the chopper together in the sky for a moment, and the orb appeared to be about 1/3 to ½ as large as the helicopter. The whole incident lasted no more than about 30-45 seconds from first hearing the helicopter to when the object and helicopter disappeared over the trees headed South.  The object and helicopter were visible for just a couple seconds of that time.  Wild!;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
Low flying round disk with 4 lights gliding through quiet neighborhood, with searchlights out since the night before.;2016-11-11 18:00:00;2-4 seconds;Low flying round disk with 4 lights gliding through quiet neighborhood, with searchlights out since the night before. I was sitting in the passenger seat of a parked car with my friend, looking out the windows. In a quiet neighborhood with tall trees and low lighting I saw, and then my friend saw what I thought was a plane at first glance.  There were 3 or 4 lights on the bottom of the craft, it was round and glided evenly and horizontally across the sky.   In addition, searchlights were on, and we're also on Thursday evening.;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
Flying Saucer Darts Erratically South Nashua;2020-07-21 23:35:00;>30 minutes;Flying Saucer Darts Erratically South Nashua I went outdoors last evening to see if I could see the Neowise comet. I didn't see the comet but I did see something very strange.  I saw a bright light and it had a little bit of red in it as well. It was darting around the sky quite erratically.  It would go to the left it would go down it would go up and go across the other way.  It zigzagged swiftly then would hover. It stayed in pretty much one spot but it did move over to the right after some time.  I did wake up the witness and he also observed it and thought it was quite strange.  There was no sound.  I did hear airplanes in the distance but I am convinced this was not an airplane.  I watched it for approximately half an hour and then just decided to go to bed.  I can't explain it.  It was circular and had bright lights. I occasionally saw some red lights.  It was just darting  across the sky in very erratic patterns. I've never seen anything like it before. It wasn't making much progress across the sky. It would do erratic patterns and then it would move over a bit. And then back to erratic patterns again. It didn't really get very far.  I got distinct impression that it was doing a search.  It was looking for something. I was glad it wasn't me it was looking for.  Of note, earlier in the day I had recounted about another UFO that followed me from Lowell many years ago. We also heard a noise on our deck that made us jump about 45 minutes before the sighting.;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
