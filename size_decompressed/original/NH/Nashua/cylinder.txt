2 large cylinder ufo's against cloud near FAA center in nashua nh;2012-08-15 20:00:00;1 minute;2 large cylinder ufo's against cloud near FAA center in nashua nh it was around 8 pm in the summer and the sun had just gone over the horizon. i was getting on to rt3 heading north from exit 3. i was looking over my shoulder as i merged on to highway when i seen a bright object next to large puffy cloud.the sun was shining off object because it was so high the sun was still hitting it. it must have been huge because it was against cloud and was still very clear to me. it was a perfect cylinder with no wings and in the sun light it looked like polished stainless steel. anyways to veiw it i kept looking over my shoulder then looking back straight so i wouldn't crash. i lost sight for several seconds as i went under overpass. when i looked back again there was 2 of them, the same, directly horizontal to the other one and only a couple hundred feet apart. niether one moved and were both horizontal i could see them clearly in my mirror to exit 5 (about 2 miles) and road turned a little. in hind sight i should have pulled over an! d filmed them with my phone camera. oh 1 more thing. this happened only about 1 mile from the FAA center and i'm sure they would have detected them unless they were somehow undetectable?;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
