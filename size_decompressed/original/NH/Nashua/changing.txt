intense goldish glowing giant star like light in the distance in the sky,changes appearance as it gets closer;2008-12-16 22:00:00;3-4 minutes;intense goldish glowing giant star like light in the distance in the sky,changes appearance as it gets closer i would like to start out saying i'm not in fact crazy in any way and my girlfriend and her friend are very nice smart girls who are licensed nurses.i am a manager at a small factory in new Hampshire. i take ufo's very seriously and have done as much research on them as i have been able to.its sorta turned into a hobby for me and seeing it with my own eyes is something i would never lie about to anyone. as us 3 are driving to my house we get to a part in the road where if you look to the left you can see over the landscape very far because of the hill we were on.about 15 feet before the left turn i had to take i noticed it and pointed it out to the other 2 in the car.as i took the left i stopped in the road so we could look at it as it was right in front of us in the sky out in the distance.one of the girls described it looking like a star blowing up in the sky. it started out a very,very intense bright,sorta goldish shimmering light in the distance wayyyy bigger than any star alomost looking a little more wide.it got our attention very easily,not to mention the overcast so no stars were showing.as i started driving closer in its direction more towards my house,it seemed like it wasnt that far away at all anymore.seemed like it was 2 or 3 neighborhoods away a little bit above the trees. at that point you could see through the trees about 3 or 4 headlight colored sphere like lights kinda clustered near each other in a slight v formation,still bright and illuminating some light around it but not nearly as intense now that it seemed to have our attention. then it came over some tree tops a ways past my house heading from my 10 o'clock position and moving into my 12 o'clock position where the trees opened up.it looked like a plane almost or more like the lights that would be on a plane,but the way they were it must of been a very odd shaped plane. at that point i was driving up my road and it was directly in front of us.you could no longer see any bright lights at all just black in between these 2 or 3 small white lights which seemed to form a sort of triangular pattern, a blue light and one red.then the object moves from in front of us and heading slowly from my 12 o'clock to my 3 or 4 o'clock position sorta slowly following the tree lines but still appearing to be moving fast.then before it was almost out of our sight,it was all of a sudden back at our 12 o'clock then drifted a little faster BACK to where it was.i had passed my house at that point so i turned around and we headed back to my house.the girls lost it at that point as it was gone over the landscape when they looked back. the fact alone that the bright lights we had seen had completely dissapeared and were not illuminating any light in the sky at all even with the clouds in it,makes me certain this was no plane with lights in a big triangular pattern.also,the altitude and trajectory it was traveling at was not similar to that of any plane i've ever seen.it seemed to float kinda slowly hugging the tree lines almost like it was watching us or making sure we could see it. i've seen a lot of ufo video and heard a decent number of cases.what i can compare it to most is the arizona lights.could be different, i don't know. all that i know is,we saw what we saw and we know it was something extremely out of the ordinary.;42.7494274509805;-71.4804352941176
