5 lights in parallel 1 underneath;2008-09-17 21:00:00;30 sec;5 lights in parallel 1 underneath My name is mark grizzle me and my uncle were driving home at about 9:00 at night after I just finished drivers ed. We were going past our general store and all of a sudden  we look to our right and there where 5 bright orange lights in parallel to each other. There was one light under the other 5 lights. We have a 2000 toyota rav 4 with a moon roof. I opened the moon roof to see If I could hear anything and there was no sound. I thought at first they were flares but flares will fly in a arc when the drop. The object must have been about 600- 700 feet above tree level so I thought that It could not have been a fighter jet testing because there not allowed to fly that low.  After about 30 seconds it just disappeared it was flying next to our car. The lights did not burn out slowly that were just out in the snap of a finger. It is really interesting to me. Me and my uncle always watch ufo files and this kinda resembled the pheonix sighting. It kind of scared me. You have no clue what it is it is just so mysterious. I really hope you guys can give me some answers because im really interested.;43.8692;-71.9071
