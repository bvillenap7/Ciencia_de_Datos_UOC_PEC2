3 red lights linear moving slowly no noise.;2012-11-06 17:00:00;4 minutes;3 red lights linear moving slowly no noise While driving North on Rte25 in Wentworth around 5 oclock pm I witnessed 3 red circular lights evenly spaced apart in a straight line in the sky moving slowly NE low, but clearing the tree line.  I pulled over after viewing it for 1-2 minutes, opened my door car running and stepped out.  They made no noise  but my car was running and there were a few cars passing at the time.   The lights maintained the same speed from the moment I first saw them to the time they went over the tree line out of my view. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.
