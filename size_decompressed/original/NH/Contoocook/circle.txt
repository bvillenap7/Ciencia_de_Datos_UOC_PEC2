Orb-like object around 7:35 pm EST. 2 witnesses. around my home.;2006-03-22 19:35:00;3 seconds;Orb-like object around 7:35 pm EST. 2 witnesses. around my home. My boyfriend and I live in this small Village about 20 minutes from concord. He just had finished walking me home and was going down my driveway looking up. I waved over at the door and went back inside. then the lights flickered and the ground shook for a few seconds then my cell phone rang. It was my boyfriend yelling excitedly into the phone, claiming that he saw a UFO. I told him to calm down and please tell me the truth (since I believe in such phonomia) there was one orb like thing and the color of that was bright yellow while the path it left was changing colors from yellow to red to blue then faded. we heard no noise except for the ground shaking at my house. it followed an arc like pattern for three seconds before it went past some trees going North by Northwest. the size was about a quarter size smaller than a full moon, the sky was clear and there were some trees behind my house, but none in the parking lot where you could clearly see it. After he ran home and told his parents and friends (who dont believe) he sat and beat himself up over it but he does truly believe that he did see something and I believe him too.  ps- we both had tension and painful burning sensations in our heads and stomachs but that could have been from excitment as well.;43.2016;-71.6953
