Three unidentified smoke trails followed by super fast super high jets.;2014-01-15 21:10:00;10 minutes;three unidentified smoke trails followed by super fast super high jets. Was outside with my g/f and saw up in the night sky three smoke trails or plane like cloud trails, however they were very close to the ground unlike a plane or jet.  Whatever had passed over had just done so for as we stood and pondered what it could be they slowly faded.  And as we turned to go in we saw very very high up a jet moving very very fast in the direction the disappearing smoke trails were heading.  And as we watched that plane disappear we turned to head inside once again it was then I noticed another jet way up the same as the last traveling from another direction but heading in the direction as the other one.  Sounds suspicious to me...;43.3627;-71.9442
