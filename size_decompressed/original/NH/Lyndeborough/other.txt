At about 8:00pm I noticed a flashing light in my line of sight in my telescope. I watched it for a few mins.  I then took my eye from the eye piece to look at it without the telescope. I scanned the sky and could not see it with my naked eye. I looked back in the eye peice and followed the object with the telescope. I could not make out a shape. It flashed a white light constantly and did not change color or direction and moved from the southeast to the north northwest.  I tried to see it with my naked eye again and could not see the object.I noticed a plane to the east and could see it with my naked eye. I followed the object until it passed behind the trees. I scanned the sky for more than 2 more hours hopeing to catch sight of any thing else. I told my parents about it. I am a welder by trade and work for a major construction company.
