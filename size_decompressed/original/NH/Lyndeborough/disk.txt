It was early in sept so it was still warm,  i was talking with dad about possible life out there in the universe we both agreed there has to be,just as we finished talking about the subject there was this object/ufo that i noticed entered through the atmosphere and was moving very fast about 250 mph or less and i thought it was a comet or something but i was wrong it slowed down and made a 180 degree turn as it changed direction it slowed down very fast and now stopped or hovered above a tree i was about 30 or 20 yards from it and then there was this blinding light and i couldn't see alot and i felt paralyzed and helpless its hard to remember alot but i think there may have been a blue orb surrounding my body so i couldn't move.  Like i said it was 8:30 i thought it only 5 or 10 min this event happend,as i began to move again i saw it leave and go straight up into the night sky.  As i walked inside i looked at the clock and it was 10 pm what i wonder is what happend from 8:30 to 10 i dont recall anything except what i told here.  In total i have seen 3 ufos the second ufo was in a field i was on a bus and i looked out onto the field and i saw a hovering gold ufo it was orb shaped and then right infront of my eyes it dissapeared.  The third i was at a store and it was cigar shaped and the clouds were 200 yards infront of it,it was moving very very slow and it had no wings or tail and it had a black front it was cigar shaped also,so i looked away and then looked back and it was gone. Whatever happened I BELIEVE!. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.
