Me and my sister and her friend were outside on our trampoline.  It was about 9:30 or 10:00 pm and we had a clear view of the night sky from where we were. Then we saw a bluish greyish flash of light and thought it was lightning so we ignored it.  Then it happened again, and continued to happen.  So we decided to look for the source but we couldn't find one. It surrounded the treeline and didn't seem to orient from somewhere.  It typically happened between 6-10 seconds from each other.  Every time my mother came out to check on us, it wouldn't occur until she left, then it would happen right after.  Even if a car was passing by, it wouldn't happen until right after the car had left. We saw small objects moving through the sky.  They appeared white, my sister even said she saw a red one.  They were too small to be satellites and didn't have lights on them so they weren't planes either, it was also completely silent besides the river running through the yard.  The objects also moved in a completely straight line, some parallel to others moving completely straight, therefore, we concluded they couldn't be satellites. We also saw three stars aligned in a triangle formation.  We looked it up and found the Summer Triangle constellation, but it was too unproportional to what we had seen, so we don't know what it was.;43.3162;-71.4683
