Multiple round objects with pulsating bright light disappearing and reappearing.;2020-08-25 21:00:00;1 hour;Multiple round objects with pulsating bright light disappearing and reappearing On August 25, 2020, at approximately 21:10 I noticed several bright lights in close formation to each other over the horizon in the tree line to the left of the Big Dipper constellation.  I recorded video with my cell phone several times over the course of an hour until the lights were gone.  The lights got extremely bright, like a flashlight being shone into the eyes when looking at them, and then would dim and completely disappear, then immediately reappear.  The lights changed position with each other and moved around in somewhat of a group, going southwest, then straight up, then straight down, and finally returning to their original location.  There was absolutely no sound make by the lights, crickets and cars driving by can be clearly heard in the videos.  The strangest part is that when taking pictures and video, no other objects in the sky could be seen through the camera, only the strange group of lights.  These lights had also appeared on August 22, 2020! around the same time and lasted about the same duration of an hour, except the position was closer to the Big Dipper constellation.  Upon reviewing the videos, the objects seem to be emitting light - not reflecting the sun, spinning very rapidly, and a tiny object can be seen moving around the largest object like a satellite.  The shape of the largest object appears to be round with a raised section and something on the top.  The smaller objects are harder to determine due to the brightness of the largest object â€“ the strangest part was that the size of all of the objects seemed to change as well.;43.3162;-71.4683
