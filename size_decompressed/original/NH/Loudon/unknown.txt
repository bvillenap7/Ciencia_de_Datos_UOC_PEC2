Flashy stars in ALMOST a triangular pattern.;2002-07-30 22:05:00;3 minutes;Flashy stars in ALMOST a triangular pattern. It's 10:20pm right now and I saw this 15 minutes ago. I live in Loudon NH right off of Route 106. I saw a group of flashing lights just now, hovering over our house on top of the hill. (We have a great view of the nightsky without any reflective light to keep out the stars) I saw it coming lazily from the west and it just headed NNE from there. I don't know if anyone else saw this. Nothing to indicate an engine so it wasn't a plane. It was totally silent. And it was almost a bunch of stars flashing. I have no clue what it was. and then it just dissappeared. Gone. Am I losing my mind?? I swear on my Grandpa's grave on what I saw, and quite frankly, I'm a bit weirded out right now.;43.3162;-71.4683
