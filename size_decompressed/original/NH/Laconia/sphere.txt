Pink orb/sphere in New Hampshire.;2017-06-26 23:00:00;10 minutes;Pink Orb/Sphere in New Hampshire I was on vacation waiting for my daughter, husband and friends to arrive at the resort when I received a disturbing phone call from the police department that my son in law had hung himself.   At first I thought it was a mistake, I tried calling my daughter..no answer.  I tried calling my son in law..no answer.  I was standing on the porch of my resort when I suddenly saw a pink orb/sphere in the sky.  It did not move...it was pink, I could see white round objects in front of it.  It was not the moon.  My neighbor below came outside to observe the orb...I yelled down to her...Do you see the orb? OMG..yes I do. We could not believe our eyes.  It was in the sky for about 10-15 minutes when all of a sudden it was gone.  Could this have been a sign from my deceased son in law?;43.5728;-71.4787000000001
