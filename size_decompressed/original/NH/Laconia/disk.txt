disk over Laconia;2005-05-07 15:40:00;10 seconds;disk over Laconia While driving down a hill on my way home, looking towards my house I saw a white disk object flying at an  /  angle about 200 feet over my neighborhood for almost 10 seconds.  I had to look away to drive, looked again 30 seconds later, saw nothing.  I was home in 3 minutes, grabbed binoculars and looked.  Nothing, not even planes.;43.5728;-71.4787000000001
6 disks  look like white lines  in sky;2005-09-10 18:30:00;30 minutes;6 disks  look like white lines  in sky I looked out over Lake Winnisquam at 6:30 PM and saw a white line against the blue of the afternoon sky. It held its straight-line features and didn't disolve like a cloud or chem trail would. It hovered at an angle then slowly went down below the trees in Sanbornton. We were able to count 4 more appear and slowly go down the same way. A 6th white line came UP from the trees in a different area and slowly took off going up. Through binoculars we could see soft blinking white lights on the tops and underneath these crafts.  I think the reason we could see them was the setting sun causing light to reflect on them, when normally they can't be seen during the day.;43.5728;-71.4787000000001
disk seen hovering beneath a cloud;2005-09-19 14:00:00;35 seconds;disk seen hovering beneath a cloud I first noticed 2 small parallel white lines, vertical, just beneath a cloud, hovering over Laconia.  For 20 seconds I watched what I thought looked like the back end of a plane, but as I watched it, it moved and appeared to change shape. Then clearly seen was a large silver-white disk, for about 15 seconds, then just disappeared without moving. I believe it was still hovering but became invisible because the cloud next to it was being blown by the winds, decreasing the reflection ability.;43.5728;-71.4787000000001
Disk seen hiding in cloud hovering over city;2005-09-21 15:00:00;10 minutes;Disk seen hiding in cloud hovering over city At 3:00 on a sunny afternoon I was driving my car up Pine St. hill.  The view in my windshield showed a small wispy cloud, within the mist I saw the edge of a Disk for about 3 seconds, it disappeared when it changed the angle of flying and the reflection off the shiny sides could no longer be seen. It's angle was  /  , at about 1000 feet up.   I got home within 5 minutes, got binoculars and scanned the area of the cloud formation. At 3:10 the disk was in the same area, and could only be seen when the sun shined off it, about 3 seconds each time. There were 3 quick flashes as it moved and became invisible once again.;43.5728;-71.4787000000001
Disk with blinking colored lights;2007-02-06 20:00:00;1 minute;Disk with blinking colored lights At 7:00 pm I stepped outside with the dog and noticed an orange light glowing just barely above the trees in the horizon over Sanbornton.  It was orange for four seconds then turned lime green and went lower than the trees, out of view. I didn't see it again. A few minutes later there was a red and white blinking light coming towards Laconia, crossing over Lake Winnisquam.  It looked like a plane, but then the blinking lights appeared to be more than two at a time and jumping around. I got my binoculars and my twelve year old son came out with his new mini-camcorder. He set up to view the plane and see if it could record in the dark. I looked through the binoculars and saw red and white blinking lights flying low over the lake.  My son was excitedly trying to get my attention because what he could see on the little video screen was several colored lights on one object, randomly blinking.  He taped 28 seconds as the silent object got closer and flew to the right of us and out of our sight over Laconia. We downloaded the clip to the computer and were able to view it on a larger screen then break it down to see thirty frames per second. Each frame had a different configuration of lights. One frame had a single red light, the next showed several lights including yellow, blue, purple, pink, red, white and green. When played at real time, it was impossible for our eyes to keep up with the colors or speed. When slowed down, the clip  shows a disk shaped craft with many blinking lights circling the outer edge. I noticed that when I looked with and without the binoculars, I only saw red and white lights. The camera lenses were able to capture the colors humans can't see as the lights blinked at such rapid speeds. After taping 28 seconds the object was closest to us and the view screen started showing too much static and was stopped.;43.5728;-71.4787000000001
