3 lights over lake;2005-04-25 03:00:00;1 minute;3 lights over lake While out night fishing on Lake Winnisquam, around 3:00 AM, two people saw 3 separate white lights, grouped closely in a triangle (not 3 lights on one plane) silently glide over, very high up. They moved fast and did not blink.;43.5728;-71.4787000000001
Huge formation of blinking lights over lake;2005-09-15 21:15:00;10 minutes;Huge formation of blinking lights over lake At 9:15 PM I spotted 2-3 blinking lights slowly fly over Lake Winnisquam, from Belmont, about 1,000 ft. up, headed north. As they came towards me, the crafts picked up speed and more lights were visible, it was hard to count them because they flashed quickly, not in unison, 8 or 10 lights, they made no noise. I called my husband and 2 friends that were out night fishing.  The 3 were in an area where they were better able to see the lights and get good descriptions of the crafts. One witness described, I saw 5 moving simultaneously objects that all maintained perfect formation.  They moved so quickly I knew they weren't aircraft.  The V formation had 8 or 9 lights and used up a huge area of the sky.  Each ship had an intense orange light shooting up into the sky. When the orange light was on, there was no blinking white light. The flight pattern would change, like geese flying in formation, when the first in line backs off to let another move up to the front.  We could see the lights for at least 5 minutes.  The 2nd witness stated, There were lines in the light when it flashed, directed up, I could see the outlines of many ships and counted 8, but couldn't keep track of them.  Two would flash, then more would come, they would turn their orange lights on. I saw them from one side of the lake to the other.  He was able to see underneath the craft and made a sketch of it.  A view of the bottom shows a square craft with one large light off-set to one corner.  The 3rd witness said, I saw beams of light shine up, down, at each other.  There were quite a few.  I've seen UFO's from a distance and was still skeptical, but this, there's no doubt. The 3 fishermen were quite spooked, packed up quickly, started the boat, and got back to the dock right away.  The lights were last seen going out of view towards Meredith. Note:  The 3 had seen many shooting stars, probably a dozen, earlier in the evening.  They had marveled at seeing so many.  This observation goes along with a theory of how the UFO's zip through the atmosphere so fast, entering and leaving, they look like shooting stars. They are usually seen around the big dipper.;43.5728;-71.4787000000001
Large groups of  white lights seen moving above the clouds;2006-12-02 18:30:00;5 minutes;Large groups of  white lights seen moving above the clouds At 6:30 pm I was standing in my driveway saying goodbye to a friend when I noticed a group of seven white star-like lights moving quickly overhead above the clouds.   I pointed to them to show my friend, then we noticed there were other groups of lights spread out in the sky above, all traveling at the same speed and in the same direction, NW to SE.  I got my husband and another friend to come out and see them.  There were so many that we all pointed to different areas of the sky as another moving group became visible between the clouds above.  To make sure it wasn't an optical illusion because the clouds were going in the opposite direction, we used electric and telephone wires above us, to focus on and watch the lights quickly cross behind the wires.  We watched for almost five minutes until there were no more moving lights and all that remained were the stars in their stationary positions.  We were not able to get an accurate count, but there may have been as many as fifty or more.  There may have been others that had passed overhead before I noticed them.

A ball of light that looked like a flashing star hovering about 150 feet over the downtown Laconia area.  The colors flashing were white, blue and orange.
