3 white craft in triangle formation, 1 red craft shot out a white light;2005-09-20 20:15:00;6 minutes;3 white craft in triangle formation, 1 red craft shot out a white light At 8:15 PM I saw 3 white blinking lights in a triangular pattern fly at about 1,000 ft. altitude over Lake Winnisquam.  They came from Meredith, down the length of the lake over Laconia, almost over my head, and continued over Belmont headed south. There was no noise and they were closely grouped together. I watched for 5 minutes. As they were going out of view through the binoculars I noticed a 4th object, a red blinking light over the horizon of Sanbornton. In the course of one minute, the red blinking object mostly hovered above the tree tops, then shot off a white star-like object that left a white trail as it took 2 seconds to go down in the woods. Then the red blinking light went lower than the horizon, out of my view. Before the 3 white lights, I had not seen any airplanes.  After they went by, there were suddenly 4 planes headed that way.  One plane kept circling over the area the flash went down, then headed south. At 9:15 PM an orange glowing light could be seen flying slowly just above the tree line where the white flash went down into the trees, then it also went below the tree line.;43.5728;-71.4787000000001
