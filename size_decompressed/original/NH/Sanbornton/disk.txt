We could see in every direction for miles and observed the usual planes.  At 9:45 PM we saw a UFO hovering above the trees in Sanbornton.  We were able to look straight ahead, parallel, and see the oscillating red, green and white lights as it hovered, moving a little, stopping, moving a little more, stopping.  We watched for 4 minutes until it moved out of sight behind some trees. At 10:10 PM we noticed a bright orange light hovering over Belmont trees, then disappeared. After about 5 minutes it reappeared, had erratic movement, changed direction and slowly went towards Laconia, changed direction towards Belmont, then back to Laconia going out over Lake Winnipesaukee, then kept going until out of sight.;43.5496;-71.6003
