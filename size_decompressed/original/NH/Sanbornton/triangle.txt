Silent  triangular craft in Central NH;2012-12-22 19:00:00;10 minutes;silent  triangular craft in Central NH I'm not positive if this date is correct but it was the night of the meteor showers.  My stepson and I were on our deck watching shooting stars.  We saw a bright light coming toward us silent and slow. It made an approach toward our house a couple hundred feet above the treeline.  As it flew over there was a single red plusating light in the center of it, you could clearly make out a triangular shape to it.  There was NO NOISE coming from this craft. Approix 10 minutes later another craft approached from the same direction only this time there semed to be an airplane following it (same flight path) from a higher altitude.  You could clearly hear the plane, but the lower craft was also silent. Anyone else experience this?;43.5496;-71.6003
