Through binoculars it became much clearer.  There were 2 orange lights with a larger yellow light between them.  The craft hovered in the same place for 30 minutes swaying slightly, then dropped out of the bottom a much smaller bright white craft that quickly took off, flying on its own, over Belmont.  The larger craft took off over Lake Winnisquam to Meredith and out of sight.;43.5496;-71.6003
