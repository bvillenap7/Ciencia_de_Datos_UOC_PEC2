shiny diamond object that made a pocket in the clear blue sky and disappeared through it leaving a whisp of cloud;2003-08-08 15:15:00;15-30 sec;shiny diamond object that made a pocket in the clear blue sky and disappeared through it leaving a whisp of cloud It was a clear blue sky, no clouds except on the horizon.  I was lying on my hammock when I saw the object fly straight over my head, fast, no sound from about NE to SW.  The weirdest thing about it was that it opened a pocket in the clear blue sky and disappeared through it.  When the pocket closed a whisp of white cloud came out and drifted over the sky.  The object was shiny and looked like it was reflecting the ground which would make it fairly close.  I'm not a pilot or a meteorologist or an astronomer, so I can't estimate heights and speeds very well, except that the object was going much faster than the planes that approach the local airport and it had to be pretty low to be reflecting ground.  Also, even though it was usually a busy time at the airport, there were no other aircraft in the vicinity.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924
3 diamond/oval shaped crafts with lights.;2014-12-14 17:00:00;1 hour;3 diamond/oval shaped crafts with lights I was just sitting around and then my dad called and said to look out the window then I saw 3 diamond shaped crafts with lights alternating from red, green, blue and white. Then one of the 3 got really bright and shot off to the north east.  Then the other 2 disappeared. I also saw them the night before.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924
