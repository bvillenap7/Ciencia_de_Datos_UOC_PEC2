4 colored figures hover in the sky;2012-01-21 21:00:00;4 minutes;4 colored figures hover in the sky Around 9:00 pm my dog was agitated.  He had a confused look and was staring right at me making funny noises.  Then he went in the kitchen area and laid down but his body was erect, this is not normal for him unless he hears something outside.  He was whimpering but it was different than let me out normal sounds.  I tried to let him outside but he wouldn't go so I went out to have a cigarette. I looked up at the sky and there were 4 figures other than stars.  What got my attention was they were all together just sitting there. The colors were very distinctive.  The colors were red, yellowish and green I think.  I don't recall anything other than all four were hovering and the lights were sparkling.  These things move so fast I can't tell if the lights were going around the saucer or just flashing quickly. I watched for about 2 minutes and one went quickly off to the right in a white streak a bolt of lightening then it was gone.  The second one not long after as I watched it just faded and was gone, no movement involved.  I watched the other two for a few minutes and they just faded right in front of my eyes. Right after they left I saw what was about 20 objects in the sky in some kind of formation.  These were shaped like a skinny oval.  I don't know how else to explain it.  They were like the color of stars but different. I came in the house for about 5 minutes and they were gone, the formations.  I looked to the west and above my house and could see clearly there were stars there and the formations to the north were gone. The sky was clear , there were a lot of stars in the sky after they vanished.  I saw the figures clear enough and all the colors.  This is my 3rd sighting in my life and I reported the last one in Manchester NH about 30 years ago or so. This truly amazes me and I am not afraid but I can't tell many people because they think your nuts. I need to report this because you wouldn't have UFO sighting reports if there weren't UFO's out there.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924

Was out on deck and a very large, blueish, round object flew right over the house.  Altitude was low. Maybe 2K feet.  Had a bright white haze around it. No sound, and it had to trailing tail.  It zipped by. Lasted 5-6 seconds and than vanished.  Night was clear with no clouds.   Never seen anything like that before.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924
Circular green craft traveling in a repeated tight circle above cloudline.;2013-09-07 22:55:00;7 minutes;Circular green craft traveling in a repeated tight circle above cloudline. It is cloudy right now, but above the cloudline, there was a green craft circling an area the size of a dinner plate as seen on the groud.  I tried to get a video but it was dark, and the area of the sky it appeared in remains lighter than the rest of the sky.  I'm not sure how long it was circling, my cousin and I observed it for about 7 minutes from my back porch. We came outside once my dogs started freaking out. I temporarily lost cell reception. It is stopped for awhile, but it is now continuing, though it is fainter now.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924
