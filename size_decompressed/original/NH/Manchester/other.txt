Red dot moving fast over Manchester, NH.;2012-06-13 22:00:00;2 minutes;Red dot moving fast over Manchester, NH On June, 13 2012 at approximately 10 pm, my niece, her friend and I were driving home when I looked up and saw something. I pulled the car over and said “what the hell is that” The girls then looked to where I was pointing and they saw it too. It was a red dot that was changing to orange and back to red. It was not moving in a straight line, but was not zigzagging out of control. It was high in the sky and seemed to be moving fast. We followed for about three blocks before it disappeared.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924

Out of the corner of my eye I saw up over the trees to my left over the median a craft of some sort.  The under belly looked like the under belly of a turtle shell.  It looked like 4-6 rounded squares under there.  They were a dark red.  As quick as I saw it, it started disappearing, starting from the back and up to the front until it totally disappeared.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924
Two glowing ring disc &quotcrafts?&quot glide over intestate;2020-10-11 22:14:00;4 seconds;Two glowing ring disc &quotcrafts?&quot glide over intestate I was merging into i93 north when I saw a dim light above. At first I thought it was a plane because there is a local airport. But this was low to the ground (around the tree line and was almost hazy and dimly lit.)  When I looked i saw 4 round circular rings which seemed to be 4 lights on the bottom of some sort of craft  the body i could not see.  It was almost just like 4 glowing rings dimly but VERY SWIFTLY glided above and spun 90• while doing so before losing sight.  Split second later ANOTHER one followed.  This one did not rotate in any sort from what I could see. Shocked and confused;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924
