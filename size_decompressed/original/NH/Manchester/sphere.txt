white sphere over Manchester,NH. Minute duration;2002-06-10 21:15:00;1 minute;white sphere over Manchester,NH. Minute duration I was sitting on my back porch having a cigarette last night and saw something I thought was a little strange. I live in Manchester,NH which has an airport and I have seen many airplanes, but this was different. I happened to look up and I saw a sphere, definitely at a high altitude moving across the sky. I have seen planes at this high altitude, but am able to see their flashing lights. This was just a white sphere. The light from it seemed to dim and grow at certain points, but it could have been cloud cover, I am not sure. However, This craft had no visible blinking lights, which I thought was strange. It was moving at a good speed over the middle of the city heading in a south east direction. I only saw it for a minute, but definitely strange. ((NUFORC Note:  The ISS was visible from NH at 21:58 hrs..  We do not know how accurate the time of the incident is here.

High Altitude silver object hovering over central New Hampshire on 9/26/09. ((NUFORC Note:  Report from airline pilot.  PD));2009-09-26 12:00:00;30-40 minutes;High Altitude silver object hovering over central New Hampshire on 9/26/09. On Sept 26th 2009 I was in Milford, New Hampshire just west of Manchester.  I was with a friend of mine.  We are both highly experienced commercial airline pilots with almost 60 years and 40 thousand hrs of flight experience between us. Around noon time my friend called me excitedly to the outside of the garage we were working in.  He pointed high up in the sky to the northeast of Milford towards a position I would have to say was very nearly overhead the city of Manchester.  As I looked I saw an object that had to be at an altitude of 70 to 80 thousand feet in altitude hovering over the Manchester area.(please keep in mind that we are both experienced pilots used to making accurate judgements of an object's altitude.)  It was spherical in shape and a greyish silver color.  This object hovered stationary for some 30 to 40 minutes.  I have seen high altitude weather ballons and I know that it would be impossible for a weather balloon at that altitude to remai! n perfectly stationary for even a few seconds even on the calmest of days  As for the idea of a helicopter, the object's altitude rules that out.(Most helicopters can't hover out of ground effect much above 10 thousand ft. Cerainly none at 70 to 80 thousand ft.) We both watched the object for 30 to 40 minutes and then watched it takeoff to the northeast at such a high rate of speed it almost appeared to vanish. I don't know what this was but I'm pretty damn sure what it wasn't and so is my friend.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924
Orbs, Orbs, and more Orbs.;2013-07-07 12:20:00;5 minutes;Orbs,Orbs, and more Orbs It was around 12:15am and 12:30am of 7/7/13 when I received a call from my neighbor. I answered his call only to be told to rush outside with my camera to the park that was located directly out front my building.   My camera battery was dead and I knew it so I immediately put on my shoes and just ran out the door.   As I approached him he was standing at the furthest point of our small park looking towards the west at the horizon just over the tree's.  I asked him what it was he was seeing and he preceded to point and say look just over the tree's.   Then I saw it, an entire fleet of orbs some red and some white.  Some were in formations of two side by side really close and others were flying around slowly like dust would in the glare of the light coming through a window. I saw about 15 to 20 orbs all coming from the west just over the tree line and then proceeding to head towards the south direction.   There was NO SOUND, they were far away though but you would think! that many planes all together would give off some sort of sound eventually.  My neighbor was taking photos but I have not talked to him yet since the incident but at the time he said they weren't all showing up on his lcd screen but I will find out soon if there is valuable data. I was telling my neighbor how crazy and awesome it was and he preceded to tell me that before I came out their were hundreds more of them.  He actually said that if he placed his hand in front of him he wouldn't have blocked them out of view.   The sky was faintly cloudy but I could still see stars from behind the thin cloud blanket.  All the orbs would get to a certain spot in the sky and suddenly just disappear.   Then about a minute or two after they all had gone and it seemed as if no more were going to show up, I turned around and looked at the sky just trying to look every where at that point and I saw a very wide but faint light going around in a circle in a clock wise direction against the clouds.   I told my neighbor while he was on the phone with his wife and he got off the phone walked over to me and saw it as well but it seemed like it could have been a spot light coming from somewhere in Manchester so we just decided to ignored it and it eventually stopped. I don't know who or what was flying last night but we do have a  Airport close by. But if it was military why would they fly in the hundreds risking freaking everyone in Manchester out.  Too many questions would be asked but that’s my opinion.  I will admit I have seen plenty of weird things in the skies and I have actually gotten used to it but when my neighbor whom always makes fun of me for admitting to being a believer calls me freaked out and sees it for himself it is a great feeling.   I have learned to not get too far ahead of myself and I understand there is many things these could have been but I have ruled out  Meteors, Lanterns and balloons.  I'm just curious as to now who else had seen them because it has to be impossible that these went unseen by anyone else.  These orbs were floating around for a good five minutes or more.  They were over the highway and plenty of residential areas.   I want to also find out what was flying in Manchester, N.H., for planes at the time of this event.  Does the city know?  But as usual this will be just another pawned off sighting.  I'm going to do my best to figure this all out.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924
Very big and bright craft over the Merrimack.;2014-02-22 19:40:00;5:00;Very big and bright craft over the Merrimack. Very large, very bright light in the center with multiple smaller ones surrounding it.   When I first noticed it we were heading up route 3  by the 101/114 interchange, I said to my gf look at that, she said its a plane coming in and I said...it's not moving, as we exited onto 101 towards 114 we saw the side which was displaying red, green, and red lights, at this point, my gf said its a helicopter because it was just sitting there hovering, I said its way to big to be a copter and no chopper noise was heard.  By the time we turned around on the exit to head north on 293 it vanished.. It was way to big to disappear that quickly, we scanned the sky, both of us unable to see any sign of this huge and extremely bright craft. It seemed it was hovering over the Merrimack river.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924
4-6 white orbs of light (at times green) in sky circling and going straight back and forth within cloud.;2015-03-27 19:45:00;2.5 hours;4-6 white orbs of light (at times green) in sky circling and going straight back and forth within cloud On 3/27/2015, I was outside with my dogs and looked up in the sky and saw 5-6 orb lights white in color in a cloud that were going around in a circle fast then slow and then suddenly disappeared. Then would reappear within few minutes and would again go around in a circle but different direction and disappear. Then would reappear in a straight line at times and would travel back and forth sometimes fast and then would slow down.  At times one would hover to the right and another one merging together and then all would disappear. This occurred about 2 ½ hours on/off and the orb lights only remained in the clouds.  Sometimes they were greenish colored and they were all round in shape.  I had 2 family members that also witnessed them.  Friends say might have been from a strobe light but there was no beam of light and would have saw the light in the clear part of sky but the orb light never left the clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the lights may have been part of an advertising display, but cannot be certain.  PD));42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924
Bright white spherical light and disc shaped;2019-10-05 07:20:00;5 minutes;Bright white spherical light and disc shaped Saw a very bright sphere move across the sky very, very, slowly.   When looking very closely, it appeared to be a disc shape, but the light being emitted was spherical.  Then it quickly vanished in the blink of an eye as it if disappeared or had some cloaking mechanism.  It was also quiet.  Never heard a sound.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924
