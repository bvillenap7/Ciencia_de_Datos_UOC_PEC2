Huge airplane shaped craft silently hovering very low and moving very slowly above highway.;2013-09-04 20:55:00;Drove by it on rt. 93N...;Huge airplane shaped craft silently hovering very low and moving very slowly above highway. I was driving north on Route 93, and I saw a very low-flying, enormous structure that looked like an airplane, Except it was hovering low and moving very slow and it was totally silent.  It couldn't have been more then several hundred feet high and it was going about 10 mph, so there is no way it could have been an airplane.  The ship was probably 50-100 feet wide.  I saw the same type of UFO flying higher, very slowly, over Peterborough, New Hampshire, two days ago, also at about 9 PM.  One other witness saw that craft with me.
