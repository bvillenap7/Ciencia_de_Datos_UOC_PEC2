Large triangle shaped craft hovered soundlessly near Elm St I never want to see anything like this again;1999-05-16 22:30:00;Not Sure;Large triangle shaped craft hovered soundlessly near Elm St I never want to see anything like this again I well understand that this event occurred four years ago. I have been hesitant to talk about it, however having discovered this website I thought it is time now to do so. I am reporting this just as I wrote in my journal that night so it isn't as though I am relying on fuzzy memories.  It was on the night of our wedding anniversary and my husband and I were driving home from my mother's house on the west side of the city. I was driving north on Canal St. then took a right(east) onto Brook St and proceeded to the intersection of Elm St. From there I went left (north) onto Elm and it was near the Bellman's Jewelers store that my husband first noticed what looked to be a very large jet. It was pretty low and appeared to be heading toward the direction of Manchester Airport. He lost sight of it momentarily as it seemed to disappear behind the New Hampshire Insurance building. It was so large and bright that he told me to watch as it would be flying right over our car. But as we were stopped at a red light at the intersection of Elm and the Amoskeag Bridge we both kept looking for the jet however it didn't appear. When the light changed I drove on slowly past the NH Insurance Building (it is on the corner of Elm & the Amoskeag) looking for the jet that had seemingly disappeared. I was looking out of my side window as my husband watched from the front windshield. It was near a funeral home that I decided to pull over to the curb as a set of lights caught my eye - red and white, not blinking and distinctly shaped like a triangle. At first I thought that it was somehow attached to the roof of the building like a set of decorative lights. But I realized that the lights were not fixed, rather they were HOVERING. And it was very large. I got a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach, like I had been kicked and lost my breath. I was overwhelmed with a sense of fear, wishing I wasn't there. I screamed at my husband It's hovering! He leaned over to look out the front windshield and the object began to slowly move toward the south. It was so close to us, just across the street. My husband then opened the car door and stepped out and look. I started to panic as I was afraid for him. The object made absolutely no sound and seemed to float effortlessly southeast over Elm St. heading toward the airport.! By this time I was so frightened I only wanted to leave. I shouted for my husband to get back in the car. When we got home we stayed up until 3 am talking about it and I had a restless sleep filled with nightmares.  The above description, as I stated before, was taken from my journal. To this day I am frightened when I recall that night.  My husband had always said he would have to see something for himself before he could believe yet he cannot explain what we experienced.  That it hovered soundlessly I cannot put out of my mind and I cannot come up with any sort of reasonable explanation. I hope I never see anything like that again.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924

Above the toll gate, but just South of the NH liquor store. I saw what I thought were fireflies in the sky, maybe 100 ft above the freeway , maybe 1000 yards ahead. As I approached the firefly like lights, I looked up and saw a triangular shaped craft traveling about the speed of a helicopter headed South above the freeway passing directly over me. It was dark and unlit, but clearly triangular in shape and with 3 funnels hanging from its underside, reminiscent of the kind of thrusters you would see at the bottom of the space shuttle. I only saw the underside of this object, and swerved my car all over the road as I looked up in amazement.  About 2 minutes after this, I pulled over at the NH liquor store and drew a diagram of what I just seen, I also wrote down a description (I wanted to capture this bizarre event while it was still fresh in my mind). While I only saw this for a second or two, I got a really close look at the funnels on the underside.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924
Triangle ufo over Manchester/Hooksett;2013-08-07 21:30:00;90 seconds;Triangle ufo over Manchester/Hooksett Triangle shaped ufo over Manchester/Hooksett area.  It started as one light that did not flash, but would occasionally zoom in and out in brightness.  As it slowly progressed across the sky rising above the tree line, a second light followed behind doing the same.  The lights were both white. As it got a little higher a third light took up the rear.  This light was a bright red light and the three together held a perfectly formed triangle shape.  We watched it float through the sky without altering its formation at all.  It was hard to tell how high up it was, but it was definitely a very large craft.  We watched it for about a minute and a half before it floated behind a building.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924

While my bathroom window does face East, and Venus has been visible, there are differences in what I saw.  I observed Venus the next night around the same time from the same place.  I noticed differences.  1. Venus was MUCH brighter.  2. Venus didn't have a hazy yellow triangle shape around it.  3. Venus didn't have a separate flitting sparkle light.  4. Venus didn't move.   5. Venus didn't eventually fade out leaving behind that optical illusion that when you slightly avert your eyes, you can still see it.  (No clouds, other stars still clearly visible).   Just thought I would clarify. :);42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924
Unusual, silent, triangular yellow light with a separate twinkle light.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Venus??  PD));2015-09-25 04:20:00;30 minutes;Unusual, silent, triangular yellow light with a separate twinkle light. I got up at about 4:20 am. Went upstairs to the bathroom. Had heard on Facebook about a sighting the day before near our neighborhood, looked out window, not expecting to see anything, but there WAS something. Triangular pale yellow light, not solid, but still triangular. Small bright white dot of light in the center, and a twinkle light appearing and disappearing all around it. Object made no sound at all. It moved very slightly in various directions, very deliberately. Took video of it on my daughter's iPad. Did not film the object well. My daughter, 16, got up and watched it with me for about 10 minutes. The twinkle light had gone by this time, but we both saw it move. After a while, it grew dimmer and dimmer until it was gone.
