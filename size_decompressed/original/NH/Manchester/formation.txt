Two red lights hovering then flying off in separate directions;2014-10-03 18:45:00;2 minutes;Two red lights hovering then flying off in separate directions A week ago, not sure because I  dismissed it, around 6:30 pm.  It was one red light that seemed to travel upwards very swiftly.  On October 3, 2014 around 6:45pm, while on my porch, I saw two red lights hover.   These lights looked close because the light seemed large. I live within an airport pathway in a small city,  I see planes and flight patterns as they enter airspace and prepare to land and take off.  What I found alarming was that they seemed very close together too close and brightness of same intensity.   The lights were bright red, they made no sound and then one traveled northeast at one o ‘clock and the other northeast at almost three o’clock.  They both were very fast.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924
Lots of red lights.;2015-08-17 22:10:00;10 minutes;lots of red lights I was on my porch when I noticed red lights that seemed to be rising over the trees in the distance.  If 12 o'clock is north they were rising at about 3:15.  They just kept floating up into the sky and proceeded to travel east.  There were about 20 or more red lights floating up like bubbles in soda.   I live on a path route to the airport in town and the first couple looked like they were flying close that is what caught my eye.  Then they all seemed to rise and head east.   This continued till 10:22pm and a few stragglers all going the same direction.  It was very eerie like, almost invasion style, like you see in the movies all at once.  Close together.   I did not hear any sounds, but this was so unnatural. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) My previous report was a military exercise. I had filed a report the night before but have recently found out that the event was a  military exercise of a new type of plane that hovers.  They must have a lot of them because there were 16+.  I am sorry to take up your time. ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  We are grateful for the report and the follow-up addendum, but we are unaware of any military aircraft that are able to hover motionless for 20 minutes, and do so silently.

Formation of lights traveling with no sound-changing formation before disappearing one light at a time.;2016-11-05 06:38:00;3 minutes;Formation of lights traveling with no sound-changing formation before disappearing one light at a time. Square shaped formation of red lights with a solid gray center- 6 lights made up a trapezoid shape with one additional red light ahead of the others was seen flying below the cloud cover.  The lights then took on different formations before flickering and then suddenly the lights one by one flickered and were completely gone.  The mass was huge- the size of a football field but did not make a sound.  Helicopters could be heard after the object disappeared.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924
Triangle formation.;2018-07-04 22:00:00;2 minutes;Somewhere around 10:00pm, I looked out my bedroom window, facing north, and noticed 3 lights, red color, but not flashing or flickering, holding a perfect equilateral triangle formation, held position then moved slowly.   After watching for a couple minutes they split apart in different directions and disappeared.  Most definitely not fireworks or an airplane.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924
