A red glowing sphere stopped and watched me.;1980-10-10 23:30:00;3 to 5 min;A red glowing sphere stopped and watched me. It was a small red glowing light that hovered around me for about 5 seconds.  It was floating about 1 foot off the ground. I thought it might have been a firefly but no it wasn't after looking at it closely.  Hand held lasers were not readily for sale to the public at the time and it was floating off the ground, not a image on the ground.  When I realized it wasn't normal, I stopped walking and started to look around to see if anyone else was around playing a joke on me.  But then again That's when I noticed it wasn't a laser but a little tiny glowing red light. It kind looked fuzzy but also not very bright.  It was about the size of a marble with a round glow surrounding it.   After about ten or more seconds of this light checking me out, It slowly started moving down the alley and took a right turn onto either myrtle or pearl St. it was the alley behind the old restaurant mai kai on Elm St in Manchester.  It scared me so bad after it went up the street, I turned around and walked the other way.  I haven't told anybody about this because I didn't want people to think I was out of my mind and in need of a doctor.   I'm not sure if it was fall or not.    It was late at night and I was walking home from the north end. I have seen another UFO at the Manchester airport but I think that was a satellite going by.  It was a red square object that was traveling in a straight path and going pretty fast. That one took about 30 second to travel the length of the sky until I couldn't see it anymore. I never knew who to tell about this until I saw your web site.  Years later on a movie I saw the exact same glowing orb that I had saw that night walking home.  That was on close encounters of the third kind.  It seemed really strange that the movie had the same thing that I saw and this was at least 2 years later when the movie came out. I would let a Dr put me under if anyone had doubts about what I saw. Another reason why I never told anyone about this.  Thanx! for your time.  Feel free to contact me if have any further questions. Thanx again.  ((name deleted));42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924
Bright light sundenly vanished when telescope is trained on it.;2001-10-24 20:00:00;30sec;Bright light sundenly vanished when telescope is trained on it. I was out looking at the stars with my telescope. I noticed a bright yellow-orange object in the south east sky. I was very bright, maybe a magnitude of-1 or-2. I thought it might be Jupiter or Saturn? It did not appear to be moving. By the time I turned my telescope in the area and tried to center it in my finder scope, it vanished.  It did not appear to look like landing lights from a plane either.  The sky was totally clear at the time.  Very unusual.  I have been an ametuer astronomer for many years.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924
Flashing neon green lights across the night sky;2003-06-08 21:40:00;5 min.;Flashing neon green lights across the night sky My boyfriend and I were driving on I-93 right along the NH-MA border.  It was a foggy night and all of a sudden we saw bright neon green lights (beam-like) flashing from the sky. They were linear, and went in different directions (diagonal, horizontal) and were very long (over 100 feet long) and high up in the sky (like the height of a plane).  There were about 6 total, lasting approx. 3 seconds each. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the beams could have been generated by a laser-based advertising light.  Just a guess.  PD));42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924
Four yellowish lights moving Zeppelin-like across the south Manchester, NH skies, disappearing after 45 minutes.;2004-08-21 22:05:00;22:05;Four yellowish lights moving Zeppelin-like across the south Manchester, NH skies, disappearing after 45 minutes. There were four lights in the south Manchester sky.  They were quite obviously not associated with any human-made craft, given the strange movement.  They moved far too slowly to be airplanes or helicopters.  There were four, and they hovered Zeppelin-like and blinking a pale yellow light.  They remained in the skies over Litchfield / So. Manchester for about 45 minutes.  The weather was foggy and humid after a day of steady rain.  After three quarters of an hour, the light disappeared.  No mention of anything peculiar was mentioned on local radio or TV.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924

Bright stationary ball of light in the sky, early morning.;2014-02-08 06:00:00;>1 hour;bright stationary ball of light in the sky, early morning. Driving from one side of the city to the other we saw a bright light in the sky in a south east direction.  We couldn't tell exactly how high it was, but it did seem within our atmosphere. Wasn't sure if it was a planet or not or what exactly it was.  It stayed pretty stationary and did have a somewhat flashy gleam to it.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924
Two large, round, orange lights in night sky over Livingston Park, Manchester NH;2019-10-14 20:00:00;5 seconds;Two large, round, orange lights in night sky over Livingston Park, Manchester NH There were two large, round, orange lights hovering within the same vicinity. It was as if there was an invisible line between them when the object/craft(?) began to move in a non-linear trajectory. It seemed to slowly disappear in front of my eyes and I assumed that it was being enveloped by clouds in the night sky. My husband also witnessed the lights. I'm not a good judge of distance from the ground though it appeared large and close for its size. My description leads me to believe it was a large craft though I only saw two separate lights--orange and round in color. It was amazing and I couldn't find anyone else who saw it other than me and my husband.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924
Just south of the city there was a UFO in the sky with two bright circular white lights. It went straight up to about 1500 feet.;2020-06-05 23:30:00;10 minutes;Just south of the city there was a UFO in the sky with two bright circular white lights.  It went straight up to about 1500 feet, then right back down below the horizon.  Thought it was an airplane because it was a couple miles west of Manchester airport.  However, it suddenly stopped and went right back down below the horizon.  Couple minutes later it reappeared and went left a few miles across the horizon and then suddenly stopped, then back in other direction before disappearing.   As a former airline pilot I can tell you this was not a strobe light or aircraft.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924

I immediately looked up at the sky because it shocked me that the sky was so clear that there were so many stars out. Then I noticed what I thought was the north star moving to the right of me way up in the sky. It continued to move with Intention. It was not moving fast but it was not real slow either. It continued to move to the right of me and I walked out into the middle of the backyard so that I could keep my eyes on it. It continues to move With intent and it lasted for about one minute to a minute and a half and then it just disappeared. It was as if you turned the switch off and it was just gone.;42.9879403846155;-71.4560360576924
