Saw a triangular lights move in a northeast direction;2008-07-13 03:10:00;1 minute;Saw a triangular lights move in a northeast direction I saw three white lights moving across the sky in the northeast direction. At first i thought they were just stars but then i noticed they were moving across the sky in perfect Triangular formation. Not your ordinary perfect triangle, more like a both sides were like 70 degree angles. It was to large to be a plane in my opinion. I would estimate it was about the size of 10 football fields. This thing was way up in the sky. Just kept going across the sky until i could not see it anymore. The lights did not come out of formation for a second. They stayed aligned the whole time. The top of the triangle was tailing the bottom 2 lights of the triangle in the northeast direction. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.
