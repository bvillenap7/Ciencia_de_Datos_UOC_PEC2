I’ve never forgotten this I even remember the date I just didn’t know there was a place to report it. It was a Saturday night, March 20. I was outside with two friends having a cigarette outside our building.  The two guys were talking, standing up nearby, and I was sitting on the ground leaning against the brick building and admiring the sky (I had just moved from Rhode Island the preceding Monday, so the fact that I could see the Milky Way was just unreal to me at the time). As I sat there, there appeared an incredibly bright “star” overhead.  I interrupted my friends to have them look at it, and we stood there in a circle looking straight up at it, completely dumbfounded.  It was just hanging in the air directly overhead, this incredibly bright white light.  We were marveling, wondering if it could possibly be a star that just looked super close. At that moment, the thing shot straight up into the sky, so fast that it disappeared into a point of light the way that objects get smaller and “disappear” when they move away from you.  I have never seen anything move so fast in my life. We all looked at each other in complete shock.  It was then that I noticed that my friend has a single tear running down his cheek, his eyes wide open in complete shock he was a mirror to us other two.  We were so in awe that we didn’t know what to do with ourselves.  No one else in the house believed we had seen it.;43.445;-71.6503
