Erratically moving object in sky 12/29/00;2000-12-29 20:50:00;2 minutes;Erratically moving object in sky 12/29/00 Going up the stairs to my house my spouse noticed something in the sky. We both looked up & watched. It was a saucer shape but a little more rounded. It went back & forth in the sky, would stop briefly then travel up & down in very fast movements. It flew away fast sideways but came back again. The odd thing was it would stop & then move up & down but extrememly fast, then side to side. The movements were strange, almost like it would stop to observe & then move around again. It was extremely large & yet quite far away. Farther then an aircraft would ever be but so large you could see it very well.  I know this was not lights, aircraft or anything I have ever seen. Nobody could tell me any different, I do not care what anyone else thinks, I know what I saw. The reason I remember the date & time so well is my father in law past away that night about an hour after. Take this story as you will.

We had just passed the damn, on our right was an opening and we saw a circular or disk shaped object in the sky, it was still in the sky with a , we watched it for about 7 to 10 seconds. 	We then lost it because there was a line of trees in our was. So we turned around to go look at it again, I saw it in the sky and it was moving in the same direction that we were.
