Six red lights in sky while night fishing.;2013-07-06 22:15:00;5-10 minutes;Six red lights in sky while night fishing On 7.4.13 at approximately 10:15 pm my friend and I were fishing from a boat on Webster Lake in Franklin, NH.   We saw six red / orange lights (non-flashing) in the eastern sky above the trees.  Given the size and speed of the objects we both thought they could have been helicopters but it seems that we shouldâ€™ve been able to hear them (there was no noise).  The lights were following each other.  The lead light eventually veered off and went out of sight all of the subsequent lights did the same thing at approximately the same spot within five minutes or so. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport - I would edit my submission. I put the wrong date on my report.   I saw the six red lights in Franklin, NH on July 6th not on July 4th  ((END ADDENDUM));43.445;-71.6503

I asked her if she saw them and she said yes.  I knew right off that it wasn't a plane because the objects were one single non-blinking light and they were all sitting there perfectly still and then they started moving to the side all in perfect unison.  They ended up behind the tree line and I knew of a clearing were you can see everything. They were gone no trace or anything just vanished.  A plane couldn't go that fast.  Naturally, I start freaking out because that was the coolest thing I've seen by far.;43.445;-71.6503
