Moving light in sky emitting bursts with solid-like ogtagon shape.;2020-10-17 20:30:00;>1 hour;Moving light in sky emitting bursts with solid-like ogtagon shape. On Oct. 17, 2020, my husband let our dog out and called me to look at what seemed to him to be an extremely bright star in the sky. I grabbed my cell phone to take a photo and realized when I looked through the camera it was sort of dancing so I switched my setting over to video to start recording.  Meanwhile, my husband had gone inside to grab his binoculars(we were both quite curious now. When he looked through them that one light you could see with a naked eye looked like two.   The object (light) was moving around randomly, always staying within a circle that reminded me of the beam of a car’s headlight and emitting off beautiful bursts of light resembling(to me) what looking at samples through a microscope would look like.   I took several videos over the course of an hour.  When I finally came inside I put one of the videos on my computer and pulled still shots from one of the videos and zooming in on them as much as possible. In one of those images, it appears to be a flat octagon object inside the fog.  Thinking it was a satellite I looked up images of them online and it does not seem to be the case. I would love to hear if this could be explained, or if it is truly an unexplainable event.  I will be paying more attention to the night sky for the object again in the days to come.;42.7565;-72.0275999999999
