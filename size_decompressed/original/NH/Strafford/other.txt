When I went out to see what was wrong I saw an intense light peering through the curtains.  I opened the curtains and there was a large flying object, approximately 25 feet wide hovering about 15 feet above the power lines.  The craft consisted of three drone-like fans with a central dome, almost looking like clover.  The light that was extremely intense.  It was a white LED- like a light that lit up the entire neighborhood. It switched to a red light that made the entire neighborhood red almost looking like it was daytime.  Made a light buzzing sound. I have never been one to believe in UFOs so I am trying to justify what it could have been but there is no reasonable explanation.;43.2497;-71.168
