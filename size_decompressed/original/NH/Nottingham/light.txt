Bright light being followed by Airplanes or Jets.;2013-11-03 18:15:00;1 hour;Bright light being followed by Airplanes or Jets was watching the football game on tv. and noticed a bright light outside my window next to the television. I walked outside and watched the light in the sky and noticed that there was 4-5 planes or jets circling the area.  The object appeared to be traveling very slowly to the south. it was a very big bright light.  I watched it from my front steps for quite a while noticing that the planes or jets seamed to be flying in a big circle around the object. slowly it moved further and further away with the planes or jets in tow.  it then changed its direction to the west and slowly went out of sight along with the airplanes or jets. then about twenty minutes too a half hr later I stepped outside to see if I could see anything and I noticed there was a lot of planes or jets in sight again.  I looked to the east and saw the light again this time traveling very fast speeding to the north west along with all of the airplanes or jets traveling with it well behind heading roughly in the same direction this time there was many more planes or jets then there was the first time i had seen it.  it went out of sight very quickly this time within a minute and all the planes did to. then the sky was clear and i didn't see more then one or two planes in the next half hr. which was probably normal traffic;43.1234;-71.1107
