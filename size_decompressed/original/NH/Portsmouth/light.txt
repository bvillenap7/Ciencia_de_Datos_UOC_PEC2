Strage lights over the river in NH;1993-10-15 18:00:00;1 min;Strage lights over the river in NH I believe this is my 2nd UFO sighting. When I was in highschool we lived in thi shousing development in Portsmouth, NH. Our house had a view of the Pisctaqua river which seperates Maine from New Hampshire. This river was known in the 50's or 60's to have numerous UFO sighting spanning over a weeks time with many coming to view the lights. This particular incident that I had witnessed was zat night and it was dark. I was in the living room talking to my friend on the phone. As I was talking on the phone I was looking out the big picture window. I saw this light in the sky. It didn't look any different than a bright star. The thing that made it stand out was the fact it bobbing up and down and sometimes left to right. I watched it for about a minute and then it went straight up and out of my sight. I tried to take a picture of it but it came out dark probaly beacause I had taken it from through the window. I really belive that it was a UFO. I have always believed in UFO's having always been told as a child the story of Betty and Barney HIll (we lived down the street from them). Both times that I believe I have seen UFO's I was not looking for them. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));43.072893902439;-70.8022853658536

Moving groups of lights;2011-12-29 19:30:00;5 minutes;Moving groups of lights My wife and I were walking in south-westerly direction on a street in the middle of our town of Portsmouth, NH at approximately 7:30 in the evening when my wife noticed several (probably five) lights in the sky arranged in an orderly (pentagon?) pattern.  The lights were all of the same intensity and my first impression was the sort of lights you might see arranged on a water tower, but I knew that there was not such structure in the direction we were looking.  As we continued to walk toward the lights, they began to move away slowly, in unison, and after moving for a few seconds, they disappeared, not because they had moved too far away to be seen, but because they appeared to go out .  Shortly afterward, a pair of lights of identical appearance and intensity to the initial group of lights appeared low on the horizon, also moving in unison in the same, upward diagonal direction as the first group of lights.  As we continued to walk toward the lights, they b! ecame hidden behind a building in front of us, and did not reappear.  We also saw another light, low on the horizon, which seemed to be following the pair of lights, but it also became obscured by the building.  Although we continued to look at the sky, none of the lights reappeared.  There was no sound.  Also, the space between the lights was quite significant and it was impossible that the lights could have been on an airplane.  The lights were yellowish in hue, did not fluctuate in intensity, and moved slowly as one group.  It was not possible to tell how far away the lights were.  Nor was it possible to determine whether the lights belonged to one large object or several smaller objects.;43.072893902439;-70.8022853658536

Stationary light.;2015-08-25 23:40:00;>30 minutes;Stationary light.  Portsmouth, NH. 08/25/2015, 23:40, 40 degrees from north, 35 degrees horizontal. Stationary object.  White constant light.  Through binoculars there were red and green balls moving around a constant white light.  The balls were moving in a vertical plane.  By eye it looked like a plane but it was stationary.  The apparent distance seemed off for it to be a star. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) This is a supplemental to my earlier report.   I had called the Portsmouth Police and an officer swung by while I was looking at the object through binoculars.  I just saw him again and he agrees is a craft.

Outside the bathroom window, which faces east, I noticed an unusually large, very bright star in the sky. ((anonymous report));2019-04-04 02:00:00;2 minutes;I woke around 2:20 a.m. to use the bathroom.  Outside the bathroom window, which faces east, I noticed an unusually large, very bright star low in the sky.  It was exceptionally bright, and so large, I briefly wondered if it was a planet.  I had never seen this ’star’ in the eastern sky before.  It was so unusual that I just kept staring at it.   To my surprise it began to move slowly across the sky in a southeasterly direction.  There are a couple of large trees in my backyard so as it traveled it would disappear behind a branch then emerge into sight on the other side of the tree.  I watched it ‘fly’ all the way across the sky in a straight line, then it disappeared from my view, limited as it was, by the small window.  It was not an airplane.  I do not know what it was, but it was strange.   I am 59 years old.  I’m a retired journalist.  I now substitute teach in public school.  I am a church-goer and I believe in God.
