Large silent black cigar shaped craft sighted over Pease AFB;1987-10-22 20:00:00;20 minutes;Large silent black cigar shaped craft sighted over Pease AFB. Back one evening in 1987 (Fall, I believe), some friends of mine and I were in Portsmouth, NH, where we stopped off at Gooseberry Market.  As we left, one of us pointed out an odd formation in the sky, over above nearby Pease AFB.  We noticed at least one other group of people ahead of us looking at it. The object was a large (two football fields length?) dark black cigar shape.  No color, no visible lights save for the ambient reflection of the AFB ground lighting on its underbelly.  It just stood there silently in the dark partly cloudy sky - it was in the early evening, so the sky was already dark by then. After a few minutes, the object began to move very slowly into a cloud - yet, on the other side of the cloud there was nothing -- it was if it were disappearing somewhere.  During that time, I recall seeing two tiny sparkly white lights drop out of the middle, swirl around each other and dart off in opposite directions. It is possible it just went into the dark sky and wasn't visible, but it really did appear as if it were gradually disappearing into thin air.;43.072893902439;-70.8022853658536
