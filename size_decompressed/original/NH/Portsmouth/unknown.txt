3 stationary lights w/ possible light structure below viewed near Pease Tradeport in Portsmouth NH.;2013-01-24 17:25:00;5 minutes;3 stationary lights w/ possible light structure below viewed near Pease Tradeport in Portsmouth NH. Driving north on I95 from Hampton I first saw a cluster of lights up near Pease TradePort as I went under the Breakfast Hill road overpass. I assumed it was landing lights from a plane.  As I got closer I noticed it hadn't moved and I could see 3 separate closely-grouped lights and what seemed to be a slight reflection of those lights off an object that the lights sat on top of. I could not distinquish the shape of the object.  Thought it might be an advertising balloon belonging to one of the nearby car dealerships but it was too high for that and no tether was visible.  As I passed the Portsmouth traffic circle and continued to the I95 Piscataqua Bridge the object stayed stationary in a position that seemed to be between Pease TradePort and Woodbury Ave.  It was dusk and difficult to distinguish shape of object just below the 3 lights but there did seem to be something with no well-defined shape- sort of like a light framework was all it looked like.  I lost sight of the object just before I crossed the I95 bridge.  Took exit 1 after bridge and pulled over as I had binoculars in my truck but could no longer find the object.
