No lights were flashing but pulsed?.  I thought it was an airplane but when the plane listed to the right, it went left and when it listed to the left, it went right, the opposite of what a plane would do.  It moved to to the left behind a church and some trees and that was the last I saw of it.  I was approximately 300 yards away from it. It appeared to be no more than 50-75 feet in the air! Very curious! Added to the above information: It was dusk, very slight star sightings.  The sun was setting behind me.  Object appeared to be over farmland.  Object color was black.  Due to the distance, no sounds were heard.  Once it went out of my line of sight (behind the church I was parked next to), I got out of my vehicle and walked towards the back of the church to see it and it was no longer visible.;43.0206;-70.9049
Large floating rectangle just hovering.  It had four or so large headlights.  The light beams projected quite far into the night sky.;2016-03-23 21:20:00;6+ minutes;Large floating rectangle just hovering.  It had four or so large headlights.
