Bright yellow/orange fireball hovered with no noise at low altitude, shining right at my house.;2013-10-23 18:30:00;3-4 minutes;Bright yellow/orange fireball hovered with no noise at low altitude, shining right at my house. Very bright but small fireball observed moving slowly low in the sky, it came to rest at a standstill directly in front of us just above tree line.   No engine or any other sound heard at all and it appeared to hold position steadily long enough for me to run into house to get binoculars, come out and look at it, discuss with 2 other witnesses, then go back in house for video camera, still hovering steadily when I came out 2nd time.   Then, as I was trying to focus camera lens, the bright orange/red light extinguished abruptly and it vanished from sight.  A moment later a jet aircraft flew directly into the general path this ufo had taken, at a similarly low altitude.  We all could hear the very loud sound of the aircraft as usual.
