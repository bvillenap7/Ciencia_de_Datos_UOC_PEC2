It was early in the morning and my wife and I were in our house, getting ready for bed.  Suddenly, outside, there was a huge flash of light, bordering on a green/blue color.  It got brighter for a few seconds, had this weird almost humming noise along with it, and then was gone just as fast as it started.  I went to the window maybe 5 seconds after the light had gone out and looked all over the front yard.  Nothing.  About three minutes later I grabbed my hat and coat and went outside to take a look and again...nothing.  No markings, no footprints, no tire tracks, no plow truck (it was snowing at the time).  I checked across the street where the transformer is, and there were no sparks or anything like that, leading me to believe it didn't blow or something.  I like to consider myself a rational person, and I've always taken anything concerning UFO's and aliens very toungue-and-cheek, and better saved for a good movie or novel.  But I have absolutely no explanation for that bright glowing light and sound outside our window I can think of that would be normal, and I've racked my brain trying to think of something that could have caused it...and I just can't.;43.0206;-70.9049
