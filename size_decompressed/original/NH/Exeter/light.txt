A bright light to the northern sky, then goes dim as it leaves.;2005-09-21 19:30:00;0.03;A bright light to the northern sky, then goes dim as it leaves. At approx. 7:30 EST, I was watching an airplane coming from the east going west.  The plane crossed over and could not be seen because of trees.  My wife was standing a few feet away leaning against the truck as I was looking up into the northern sky.  I seen a real bright light and I said,What the hell,   my wife looked up to where I was looking and asked what is that as the light got dim.   I said I don't know what that was, but it was no plane as it was way to far away.  It looked as if it was a plane coming down at a 90 degree angle with it's headlight on.  The light was bright, then went dim as it dissapeared to the sky.  I thought it could have maybe been an after burner from a Stealth plane, but I do believe it was way way to high to be one.  It looked as if it was heading towards a star in the northern sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

June 20, 2012, Exeter, NH - slowly-moving red/orange lights traveling in a wavering line across the evening sky, then fading away.;2012-06-20 21:00:00;7-10 minutes;June 20, 2012, Exeter, NH - slowly-moving red/orange lights traveling in a wavering line across the evening sky, then fading away. My husband and I were driving home to Exeter, NH around 9:00pm when we noticed a string of slowly moving red/orange lights in the sky.  There was no sound, and the lights appeared to float in an erratic line, traveling from right to left above the horizon. As they traveled across the sky, each light would get to a certain point and then slowly fade out then disappear completely. It seemed to us that they were turning so that we no longer saw the lights. We reported this to a local police officer, who didn't seem concerned or interested. He said he would call it in,  but we saw no evidence of that.  In checking the newspapers and online, there was no mention of it.  The only place we've seen evidence of the same situation was on this website. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));42.9827;-70.9472

Two adjacent red lights hovering and slowly rising and descending over Fort Rock Farm in Exeter, NH.;2014-07-12 21:10:00;30 seconds;Two adjacent red lights hovering and slowly rising and descending over Fort Rock Farm in Exeter NH Three adults and one teen were at the fireworks in Exeter, tonight (I was one of the adults). The fireworks were over the river.  We were by the car parked across the street from the river, in front of Fort Rock Farm.  Fort Rock Farm was behind us, as we were facing the river. Fort Rock Farm has been abandoned for years, without any lights on at all tonight.   One of the adults, my son, pointed behind me and said, What's THAT?  The other three of us turned completely around and looked.  Hovering over the back of the field of Fort Rock Farm, were two red lights positioned opposite one another, like car headlights, but closer together.  The lights hovered up high (possibly rising a bit) and then the lights began to very slowly descend until they disappeared.  They made no sound at all.  It was too dark to see anything.   Although there are R. R. tracks behind the farm, there was no train going by.  There was no reflection of any fireworks.  I kept checking back, when the fireworks were going off, and there was no reflection at all behind us of the fireworks.  During the event, I had a camera in my hand, but was so shocked by what I was seeing and by trying to make sense of it, that I didn't think to film or take photos until the event was over.  We all confirmed with one another what we had seen.   The two very young children with us had not turned around and didn't notice anything.   No alcohol or any substance of any kind was consumed by any of us that day, and my son and I and the teen never drink any alcohol or consume substances at all (aside from an asthma inhaler).;42.9827;-70.9472
4 yellowish-green vessels 3 seconds apart moving about 1000 mph single file.;2019-09-06 09:20:00;10 seconds;4 yellowish-green vessels 3 seconds apart moving about 1000 mph single file. Something caught my attention in the sky and I looked up and it was very cloudy so the “vessels” were above the clouds.  I saw about four flashes of light that must’ve been moving over 1000 miles an hour.  No blinking lights, just one fast-moving yellowish green light.;42.9827;-70.9472
