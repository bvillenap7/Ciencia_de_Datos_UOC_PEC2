Object spotted hovering East/Northeast of route 101 while traveling between Exeter and Epping.;2019-11-16 15:20:00;Two to three minutes;Object spotted hovering East/Northeast of route 101 while traveling between Exeter and Epping. I was traveling East on Route 101 between Exeter and Epping when I noticed what I believed to be a plane traveling East/Northeast, as if it were taking off.  What seemed odd, was that there were no vapor trails and the object was not visibly getting smaller, as if it were traveling away from me.  I tried to point out the object to a passenger, who in return said “what object”.  When I looked again, the object spotted seemed to be oblong and/or oval and stationary.  The portion of the object facing me, seemed to “glow” is if reflecting the sun.  However, the sun was setting on the opposite side of the object, from my perspective.  The passenger asked again “what object”, as I pointed in the direction of the sky where the object was clearly visible to me, no clouds, and the passenger response was “what object”.  As I tried again to explain where in the sky the object was, I looked at my passenger, I looked back towards the object, and the object was gone.  I have no explanation for the objects disappearance, I did not look away long enough for a plane to turn (left, right or straight up) to leave my viewpoint of the sky.  This last sentence was the hardest to explain, it was gone?  To explain a little further, when I first noticed the object, it looked as if I had a small chip and/or crack on my windshield.  I reached to the windshield to determine if it were a small crack, a reflection, or something in the background (sky).  After reviewing the windshield and noticing that no crack existed, I asked a passenger “is that a plane”?  The whole experience lasted about three minutes.  I was driving, traveling about 70 mph, sun was in front of me.;42.9827;-70.9472
