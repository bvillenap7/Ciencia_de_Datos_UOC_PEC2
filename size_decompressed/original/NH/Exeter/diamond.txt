I saw three diamond shaped lights in Exeter NH back in the 90's.;1992-12-08 21:00:00;seconds;I saw three diamond shaped lights in Exeter NH back in the 90's. This event took place close to 11 years ago. I was driving home to Exeter, NH from Kittery ME. It was between 9-10pm and it was a clear cold New England evening. I was driving westbound on 101 (in Exeter) just before reaching the (Newfields Rd.) exit. I was traveling approx. 56 miles per hour but slowing down to approach my exit. This area of 101 was not populated at the time and my exit dumps into a typical NH country road. There was no traffic behind me but a car up ahead some distance. Just before my turn I noticed three white lights above the tree line ahead (west) on 101. I slowed down  noticing they were lined up next to one another( in a row). As my exit grew closer the diamond shaped light furthest to the right shot straight up and disappeared. The one next to it turned a bit stopped and hung there a moment then flew off in a different direction ( to the left)and the last one went  to it's left and also dissapeared from view. I had a passenger with me and we both saw it and looked at eachother after the event. I have told one other person this story.(My wife) I hope you enjoyed my recollection of this event. Not sure what I saw but I figured you people would appreciate this. Thanks for reading this.  ((name deleted));42.9827;-70.9472

Diamond shaped hovering silent craft.;2018-02-26 19:45:00;5 minutes;Diamond shaped hovering silent craft. Driving west-bound on 101 through Exeter.  Saw a low flying diamond shaped object with white lights at each corner.  Lights not flashing, just solid.   Thought it was a small plane at first but when I got closer realized it was barely moving, just hovering silently.   I drove right by it as it remained in place and tilted slightly to one side.
