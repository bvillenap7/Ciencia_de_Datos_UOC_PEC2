8 red burning orbs from south to north, below the cloud cover.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sky lanterns???  PD));2018-10-06 21:30:00;30-40 minutes;8 red burning orbs from south to north, below the cloud cover. First red orb spotted at 21:30, 10/06/2018 due south, rising at a speed about twice that of an air craft.  Second orb became visible about a minute later.  Both orbs remained visible as they flew directly overhead, heading north and disappeared into the north horizon.  No sound was noticeable and remained in view 4-5 minutes.  Neither of the original two had much of a trail, but one had visible break off like a flare that burned up within a second or two.  Less than a minute after the first two disappeared, the third and the fourth came into view from the same southern location.  One was larger than the first ones and had a noticeable tail to it.  These two also released items that quickly burned up. There was complete overcast with no visible stars or a moon, so these were very low in our atmosphere.  In total, there were 8 and they spread out into longer intervals between.  Eventually only one in view at a time.  The whole event lasted about 40 minutes.  Some never made it to the far horizon, but at least 3/4 of the way.  The ones that didnâ€™t flickered out without any debris. There were four of us that witnessed this and none of us have seen anything like it. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sky lanterns???  PD));42.9827;-70.9472
