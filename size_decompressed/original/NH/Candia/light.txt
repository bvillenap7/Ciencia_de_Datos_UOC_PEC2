I passed between a barn and house following an old tote road used by snowmobiles. I entered woods bordering both side of the trail. I had gone about 50 feet and infront of me possibly 50 yds ahead, I saw three large circular lights. I only saw the lights. They were blue and red and blinked in some timed fashion. I don't remember hearing anything and that's what surprised me most. It appeared as if wind was blowing around the lights, yet, no sound.
