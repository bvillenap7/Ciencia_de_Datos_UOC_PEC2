7 orange spheres seen flying South East from Alton to Seacoast;2011-12-31 20:13:00;2 min.;7 orange spheres seen flying South East from Alton to Seacoast There were five bright orange spheres flying  over Lake Winnipasaukee in a south eastern direction. We first saw them from our huge living room window and we ran out onto the deck outside. They were easily seen and moving faster than a small air craft could. They were completely silent. We watched five of them fly over ( almost directly overhead) and they were equally spaced, the exact same size and orange color and all five were silent.  There were no blinking lights on any of them.  There were also two more flying quite a distance behind the other five.  As they made the same flight pattern that the other five were on they curved out over the lake and headed East across Alton Bay.  Those two were quite a distance from us.  I grabbed my camera on my phone and took a picture of one and made an attempt to video the lights. When I zoomed in, the object appeared to be more of a tear drop shape, but the photo really wasn't fantastic.;43.4867;-71.245
