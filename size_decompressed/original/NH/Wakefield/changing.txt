Bright white  5 -pointed object surrounded by hazy/cloud, travelled SW to N, ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));2004-08-31 21:00:00;30 min;Bright white  5 -pointed object surrounded by hazy/cloud, travelled SW to N, then light diminished, haze remained. Looking SW I saw a very bright light with a cloudy haze surrounding it. I initially assumed it was the full moon coming from behind a cloud, but the sky was otherwise clear with full visibility of stars. 10 minutes later I looked and this light had moved a large distance toward the north and through binoculars, the object appeared to be star-shaped with 5 appendages, the point to the left being the brightest. Over the next 5 minutes the object appeared to be a white haze in the sky but through binoculars perhaps, it seemed to be travelling upward and thus leaving only a dim light visible. I am on a lake with no light pollution and this was a unique viewing. ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.
