I was sitting on my deck this evening to enjoy the sound of the crickets and frogs, when all of a sudden, my attention was drawn the the sky above me.  I looked up and I saw two orange spherical balls following each other side by side, gliding across the night sky.  They were to close together to be considered airplanes or satellites, and it didn't behave like a shooting star of a comet.   Immediately, I grabbed my phone and recorded it on video as they flew across Pine River Pond.  I managed to record them for a good minute before they just disappeared.;43.5513;-71.02
