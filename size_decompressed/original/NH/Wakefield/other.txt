5 appendaged object    ((NUFORC Note:  Result of earlier missile launch.  PD));2004-08-31 21:00:00;20 minutes;At approximately 9 pm EST my husband called me to our dock on Great East Lake in Wakefield, NH to see something weird. In the SSW at about 2 o'clock, facing south was a fuzzy blob in the otherwise crystal clear sky.  I ran in for binoculars and we saw a very distinct 5 appendaged object.  It had an elongated head which was brighter than the appendages.  It continued to travel northward and within 20 minutes disappeared behind the hill. I thought it looked like a seastar or animal hide.  We saw a number of jet aircraft after the sighting which is unusual for our area. I will send a drawing. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone on two occasions, and we found her to be quite factual in her description of the event, and seemingly quite credible.
