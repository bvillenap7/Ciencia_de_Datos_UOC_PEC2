Triangular shape ufo seen by 3 in New Hampshire.;2012-01-08 19:00:00;2 min;triangular shape ufo seen by 3 in new hampshire it started as a tiny orange dot above the guy next doors house. it then moved at a vary high rate of speed  across the sky and was just above the tree line in our yard it was roughly 600 feet above the tree line. it was so large you could not put your open hand up to the sky to cover it. at this point the orange light was gone but it was close enough that details of riveted body panels could be seen. it had several recessed like spots on the sides. it was triangular in shape and had a tail fin type protrusion on the wide side of the triangle and from this tail it was glowing a blue like light.  it was colored like a dull gun metal, and made no sound. it hovered in this spot for about a minute and a half before going straight up than shooting straight off into the night sky.;43.5513;-71.02
