Around 2:30 we decided to go down to the lake to watch the northern lights.As we were watching we noticed a strange light in the sky that definitely was not a star.We watched for about 15 minutes as the light danced around erratically, and got brighter and softer.All of a sudden the light dissapeared and a shadow shot across the sky above our heads.I'll be completely honest, i've always thought ufo sigtings were bullshit, but what i saw was definitely not a plane,weather balloon, or any kind of man made aircaft.The fact that i saw it while i was watching the nothern lights really freaks me out.;43.9844434017594;-71.0761923753669
moving lights and screaming cats~!!!;2009-12-04 08:04:00;4 minutes;moving lights and screaming cats~!!!  500 Lights On Object0: Yes My roommate and I step on the back step to have a cigarette Dec 4th at 8 o'clock. When to my surprise my roommate points above the tree tops in the sky behind my house. To my astonishment I look up and see 6 lights moving in a row from left to right. So I yell to my boyfriend to come out side, that my roommate and I thought we might have seen a UFO. He grabs the video camera but it appears dead. But he makes it to see the lights go from right to left disappear for a moment and then down up and disappear. Then my roommate steps back in the house, leave my boyfriend and I out side. About 2 minutes later we hear a cat screaming in the woods. That is when I ran back inside. It must have also killed our video camera cause it was charging all day and when my boyfriend tried to use it to capture the phenomenon it was dead. And our TV antenna was frozen for a couple minutes.;43.9844434017594;-71.0761923753669
