Possible Missile Test.;2007-09-05 13:00:00;1 minutes;Possible Missile Test. The craft had a northeast heading. It sounded like a jet, looked like a jet, but it didn't have wings.  The speed was comparable other jets I've seen.  It is my belief that this was a missile test. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Large white cigar shaped object.;2015-09-06 12:00:00;30 seconds;Large white cigar shaped object. My husband and I were driving north on rt 28 above the traffic circle towards Wolfeboro.  Up ahead of us, we saw a brite white cigar shaped object moving southeast.  There were no markings and we could see no wings or anything that would lead us to believe it was an airplane.   It was flying very low, too low and slow it seemed, to be coming from the airport in Gilford.  As we got close we lost sight of it.   Any other reports or explanation of the sighting would be appreciated;43.4642;-71.2316
