Triangular (boomerang) shaped craft with multiple white lights that suddenly appeared, disappeared,  and then reappeared;2014-10-17 18:25:00;7-8 seconds;Triangular (boomerang) shaped craft with multiple white lights that suddenly appeared, disappeared,  and then reappeared Originally saw one bright round light with two of the same size lights off to the side. Another light appeared to make a triangle shape.  The light to the side disappeared and then each of the three also did one at a time.   Approximately ten seconds later all three reappeared in a perfect triangle and a black outline could clearly be seen around it.   Two other separate lights then appeared off to the left-hand side.  The two went out again one at a time and about two seconds later the entire triangle disappeared at once.   The lights were all round and white, resembling headlights from a vehicle.  They were much lower than an airplane and resembled nothing that I have ever seen except for the picture from the nashua sighting, the picture that was circled.   There was no other color except for the extremely bright white lights and the black outline behind the three that formed a triangle(boomerang).  The bottom of the triangle was not outlined.   In the ten seconds that it took them to reappear they had moved a considerable distance however the formation stayed the same.;44.4946;-71.5654
