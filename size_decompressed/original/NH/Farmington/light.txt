Soundless white light moving horizontally just above tree line;2011-11-06 22:57:00;20 seconds;Soundless white light moving horizontally just above tree line I was sitting on my front porch, looking out due west at the clear, starry sky.  Straight ahead, I noticed a white light moving horizontally, from west to north, just above the tree line.  I thought it odd that it was so low and close, yet I heard no noise.   My view was partially blocked by a few leafless trees, so I could not be sure if the light was steady or blinking.  It moved with a steady velocity, neither slowing nor speeding up. It was moving towards dense forest, and would soon be blocked from my vision, so I walked down my driveway to observe for as long as possible.  I watched it until I could no longer see it.   Oddly enough, I did also see a shooting star just west of the light, while i was standing in my driveway.  This was an interesting comparison to me, because what I'm reporting was definitely not a meteor. I do live about 30 miles from an airport which use to be the site of an air force base and also about 10 miles from a smaller airport.  I have seen every sort of aircraft imaginable, but nothing like this. I do not consider myself a UFO buff, nor am I the type to seek out sightings or contact.  I felt the need to report this because it was so odd, low, close and soundless.;43.3848;-71.0671
