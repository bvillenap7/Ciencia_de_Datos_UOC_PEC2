Red ball of light.;2017-01-27 17:30:00;5 seconds;red ball of light. Driving west on route 11 in the Farmington/New Durham, NH, area and saw a red ball above me.  It seemed somewhat stationary as I drove under it rather quickly and was only able to glance up at it a few times.  It was not blinking and seemed to be different shades of red. There are no towers around and it appeared to be higher up where a low plane might fly.  The size of the ball was much larger than a tower or plane light and again, it was not flashing.;43.3848;-71.0671
Bright white glowing orb spotted  in Northern Sky of Farmington NH;2017-06-24 22:00:00;30 seconds;Bright white glowing orb spotted  in Northern Sky of Farmington NH The appearance of a very bright circular dot flying high in the Northern part of the sky occurred around 22:00 hours on the 24th of June 2017.  My partner and I witnessed it together as a glowing circle of pure white light moving rapidly in a straight line from North to South.  Its movement was very swift and steady with no sound at all.   There were no blinking lights or colors as with aircraft, just a very swift and steady movement that lasted for about 30 seconds before disappearing beyond our line of sight.   About 15 minutes later we observed normal aircraft with blinking lights and the sound of motors humming within the same area but not traveling at a Â¼ of the speed that the previously-sighted craft had exhibited.;43.3848;-71.0671
