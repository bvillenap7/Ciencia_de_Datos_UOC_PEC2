Diamond or shield shaped object above cross country  ski trail;2014-02-10 15:00:00;5-10 minutes;Diamond or shield shaped object above cross country  ski trail Saw it when I was skiing on the rail trail that was heading toward Claremont.  Snowing a heavy wet snow at the time.   Saw movement about 300 yards ahead on the trail.  Looked like small black ants moving about with a black box type of thing.  Thought they might be snowmobiles?   Looked up and saw a diamond or more like a English shaped shield.  One side was a reddish color, the other side was metallic colored. It moved into the tree line then disappeared.;43.3532;-72.1838
