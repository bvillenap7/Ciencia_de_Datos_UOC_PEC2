I was walking along the sidewalk heading west as something caught my attention to the right.  There was an object about 200 feet high traveling east to west.  I stopped and stared at it, the object was a ball or circle of green light with no sound.   As I stood there it flew horizontally for 5-10 seconds then disappeared in open sky.;43.3532;-72.1838
