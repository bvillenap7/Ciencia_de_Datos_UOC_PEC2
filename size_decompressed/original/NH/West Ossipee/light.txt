Orange Lights Moving Very Slowly In The Night Sky;2011-10-09 20:00:00;10 min.;Orange Lights Moving Very Slowly In The Night Sky Viewed from the drive-up window at McDonalds in West Ossipee. My wife and I decided to stop by McDonalds to treat ourselves to a couple McFlurries.  While sitting in our car waiting, I noticed a couple somewhat orange looking lights in the night sky.  These lights appeared to be located a couple miles south of our location at an altitude of approx. 2000 ft., probably slightly to the west of  Rt 16. We saw two (2) orange lights (somewhat brighter than stars)  moving very slowly in a southbound direction, then spotted a third light traveling from a west to east direction (also traveling slowly).  There was some distance between the two original lights about the width of your thumb if holding it up toward the sky.  After a couple minutes, the southern-most light was no longer visible, then the other one also disappeared.  This left the third light still in sight.  This light now turned and headed north toward us. We were hoping that it would pass over us so we could get a better look, but it turned south again and disappeared after a few minutes. I have no idea what these lights were, but I did wonder if they were flames suspended below small balloons.  The only problem with this theory is that they changed direction. How would two move north to south, and a third move west to east, then head north before turning 180 degrees and heading south?   One other note: while watching this, we saw a police cruiser with blue lights on heading south on Rt 16 in the direction of the lights.;43.8131;-71.1959000000001
