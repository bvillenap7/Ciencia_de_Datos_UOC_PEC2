Fuzzy trianglular patch of light in the night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD));2007-12-10 18:35:00;few minutes;Fuzzy trianglular patch of light in the night sky Monday night, December 10th, around 6:35 PM. Sky conditions were clear with scattered light clouds. Noticed a somewhat triangular looking fuzzy patch of light about 45 degrees above the horizon, towards the south and west. My first guess was that it may have been the Comet Holmes, though the appearance was different, as was the apparent location in the sky. I thought nothing more about it, until hearing the reports on Coast to Coast AM. ((NUFORC Note:  Missile venting fuel in space.  PD));42.7493;-71.7575
