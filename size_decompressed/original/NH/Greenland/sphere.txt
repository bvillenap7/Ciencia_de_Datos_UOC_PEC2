I saw a glowing green sphere cross the sky horizontally east to west;1998-03-12 08:34:00;3 to 5 sec;I saw a glowing green sphere cross the sky horizontally east to west I  had just re-entered I-95 southbound from exit 3 near Greenland, New Hampshire, when I saw a green glowing sphere cross horizontally from east to west.  I first saw the object in my drivers side mirror and then in my passengers side.  The object appeared to be about the size of a baseball.  I was driving a tractor trailer and immediatly turned on my cb radio and I was shocked to hear at least four other truck drivers had witnessed the same event, a green glowing sphere.  I had also seen a strange looking airplane about twenty to thirty minutes prior to seeing the green sphere.  The craft resembled a plane in nature but had strange x like wing pattern.  I saw this x wing like plane first and dissmissed it as blurred vision from being on the road too long.  The x wing type plane was seen through my front window while exiting I-95 at exit 3 to go the truck stop. I saw the green sphere getting back on the same exit, and thats when I began to question the first x wing like plane.  I am not sure about the first plane like craft because it caught me off guard and happened quickly.  The x wing craft appeared low to the ground and looked as though it could have been making a landing approach, again another reason why I had brushed this incident off at first.  I did not have the cb on when I saw the first object, so I am not sure if it was seen by anybody else, or if my eyes were playing tricks on me.  The green glowing sphere, however I am sure about and had confirmed by speaking with other drivers who had also seen it.;43.0353;-70.8475
