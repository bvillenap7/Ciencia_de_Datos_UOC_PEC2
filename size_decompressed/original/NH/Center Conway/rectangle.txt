I looked to the east to see a light rectangular in shape, 40 degrees from horizontal, moving southward. It was 1/2 X 1 (finger spread against the sky) moved two inches across the sky before turning red, and then disappearing. Five minutes later, looking northward again, I saw a similar shaped white light/object, at 55 degrees, move an inch across the sky eastward, NOT turning red, then disappearing.
