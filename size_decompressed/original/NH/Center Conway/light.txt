Glowing, flickering light with reds moving in western sky. Slowly moving.  Fading in and out towards horizon. ((Venus??));2020-03-31 23:00:00;20 minutes +;Glowing, flickering light with reds moving in western sky. Slowly moving.  Fading in and out towards horizon.  But not farther away. I saw a Facebook post about lights in the sky in Tamworth, Ossipee, and North Conway at about 2230.  I went outside and looked around. I saw a strangely bright , flickering light.  I looked at a star guide app and thought it might be Betelgeuse.  2 minutes later I look back and it’s gone. Found it again and followed it for the next 20-30 minutes.   Bright, flickering, with reds.   Would be really bright and then dim to nothing.  When it would come back it would be in a different location. Not by much but enough to notice.  When i first saw it, it was at approximately 5,000-10000 ft.  When I lost sight of it from my house it had sank approx. 3-4000ft. In relation to horizon line.  Was not moving at all like a plane.   Way too high for a small drone.  Multiple sightings from cross towns.  Also I’m sober.  Don’t do drugs.;43.9864;-71.0632

Trailing object was 4 inches behind, and slightly lower. Lead object slowed speed abruptly, then turned red. Trailing object slowed so dramatically it was as if it hit its emergency brake, but did not turn red. Both objects continued at the slow speed. I lost sight of both lights/objects in the clouds and trees. This was actually the first of three sightings the past 3 1/2 months. (Note: 07/29/2020 and 09/15/2020);43.9864;-71.0632

After a two minute pause, at a slightly higher latitude, 31 white lights in single file, unequal distances apart, same speed, 20,000 feet also moving west to east. No response from Portland, ME FAA Office to my inquiry on 9/17/20 of (military) aircraft in the area at that time and place 9/15/20 @ 5:00 AM.;43.9864;-71.0632

It disappeared, then every three seconds afterward would flash/reappear being smaller and less bright, moving northward with a noticeable increase in speed and distance with each of the eight reappearances in 24 seconds.;43.9864;-71.0632

Northern night sky, 50 degrees from horizontal, a stationary light suddenly and quickly moved northward (towards Canada) until out of sight. I initially mistook it for a star ... until it started moving! ((ADDENDUM FROM WTNESS)) Correction 5:25 AM @ 10/12/20 report CORRECTION: 5:25 AM not PM. ((END ADDENDUM));43.9864;-71.0632
LIGHT/OBJECT CHANGING DIRECTION THREE TIMES QUICKLY, AND CHANGING COLOR.;2020-11-20 18:25:00;35 seconds;LIGHT/OBJECT CHANGING DIRECTION THREE TIMES QUICKLY, AND CHANGING COLOR. A bright white light in the NNW, 60 degrees above horizontal, flashed then disappeared. It reappeared three more times moving downward, a flash then disappearing for five seconds each time . The last flash in the downward direction was red before disappearing. Five seconds later the flash (white) reappeared moving to the left, disappearing and reappearing five seconds later continuing leftward as a red flash. The next two flashes were white, at five second intervals, and moving to the right. It then disappeared.;43.9864;-71.0632

Then it pulsed GREEN, then back to RED, then GREEN again. The light pulsed RED, then WHITE, and back and forth. Then back to RED and GREEN pulsations. The light then quickly moved away in a North Westerly direction until disappearing. (I wonder if it could have been a drone, stationary but rotating ... this was 70 miles from the Canadian border.);43.9864;-71.0632
