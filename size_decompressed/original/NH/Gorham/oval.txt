Bright circular donut shape white light.;2015-07-13 22:00:00;3 minutes;Bright circular donut shape white light Looking up into the night sky at the stars I thought I was looking at a small closer to earth star.  Then it flashed a circular donut shape white light.  While still looking like a star it seemed to wiggle some and move up at the same time.  Then it flashed the white light again.  The star object then began to move across the sky like a satellite would and looked like a satellite would look moving across the night sky only it flashed that same looking white light 3 more times before moving out of sight behind the top of trees.  I am wondering if satellite behave like this when they are being repositioned ? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));44.4048;-71.1548
