Bright lite seen moving eraticaly over mountains with no noise.;1971-02-01 19:00:00;5 minutes;Bright lite seen moving eraticaly over mountains with no noise. I was a child or about 6 or 8 years old and out scraping ice from the driveway.   I looked at a light moving over a mountain in front of the house and noticed no noise as well as very angular movements.  The light was steady and not blinking, it moved rather slowly but very erratic.   I watched for about five minutes and ran into the house.  I was with a friend and told him to go home - I don't really remember telling him to go, but I dont remember him being there when I ran into the house.   Its been on my mind my whole life and just wanted a place to let someone know.  Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));44.4048;-71.1548
the craft was a big bright gold light that moved for one place in the sky to another in a blink of an eye;2002-03-28 18:54:00;10 seconds;the craft was a big bright gold light that moved for one place in the sky to another in a blink of an eye i was coming home from my friends home when i my mom and i saw a big gold bright star.  It seemed like it was a plane that was flying low, but then it dissapered.  after a few seconds it came back in the same spot.  Then it came back in a different part a in a blink of an eye. it also had little red a blue lights on the sky.  but im sure it wasnt a plane or hellicopter because it was so high up with such a huge size for the altitude.;44.4048;-71.1548
