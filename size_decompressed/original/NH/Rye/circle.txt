Bright orange orb or sphere...being chased by two helicopters at night..;2018-06-07 10:15:00;20 seconds;Bright orange orb or sphere...being chased by two helicopters at night.. During the night of June 7, 2018, around 10:12 PM, I heard a helicopter.  It was loud not like a charter helicopter which flies by during the day for scenic tours.  So I had gone outside to see it and when I viewed the helicopter and seeing the lights of it.....to the left and just a little ahead of that was this bright orange round orb.  It was no reflection it was just this bright orange round globe.  And after seeing the first helicopter....there was one right behind it and was chasing this light...glow....orb...round existence of what is was.  It only lasted for maybe 20 seconds and wished I had my cell phone to video it.  It WAS something I have never seen before for that. I live just across from the ocean in Rye, NH.  I may have seen things on video or television before.....but this was live...and real.........!!! ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere in describing his sighting.  PD));43.0095;-70.7652
