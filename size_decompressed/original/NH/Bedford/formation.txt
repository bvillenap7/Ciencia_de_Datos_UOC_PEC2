Three circular, flashing UFO's moving in erratic patterns before traveling away in a line.;2015-09-27 22:30:00;20 minutes;Three circular, flashing UFO's moving in erratic patterns before traveling away in a line. I am reporting a sighting of three flashing UFOs during the peak of the lunar eclipse, witnessed by at least 5-10 people.  The three circular crafts moved rapidly in looping patterns around each other, behaving erratically and flashing yellow and orange before departing in a straight line directly behind each other. The UFOs were witnessed in the eastern skies at a hill in Benedictine Park in New Hampshire–they caught my attention with what I thought was a camera flash.   I continued to watch them as then made wide loops and diagonal lines around each other, speeding up and slowing down while giving off bright flashes of yellow and orange lights before dimming again.  I could hear many others noticing and commenting on the UFO's as time passed, trying to get a better look.  Some flashes were very bright and others weren’t so dramatic.  Their pattern of flight was very irregular until they began to travel away, moving in a single-file line very close to each other. The crafts rapidly sped up and took off beyond the treeline.  It may have not been related, but there were loud booming and rumbling sounds right after the crafts sped up that lasted for about 15 seconds.  There were two planes that traveled nearby the crafts immediately before the UFO's lined up and left. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.
