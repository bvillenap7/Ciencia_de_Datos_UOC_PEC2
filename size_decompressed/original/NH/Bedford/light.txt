Yellow-orange stars moving erratically then stopping, and so on.;2008-09-14 20:00:00;15 minutes;Yellow-orange stars moving erratically then stopping, and so on. My friends and I were at the Bedford town park watching the stars one night and I remember we all sort of saw them at the same time. there were all of these yellow-orange stars in the sky and they would all move at once, then stop, then move again and stop, and this went on for a while.  i've never seen anything move like that before. once they disappeard all together in the same direction, we heard this loud noise I can't exactly explain (certainly the noise could be unrelated and explained by nearby traffic?) and we ran down that hill into that car so fast.
