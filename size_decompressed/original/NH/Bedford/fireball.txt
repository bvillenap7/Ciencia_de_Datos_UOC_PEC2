UFO Sighting, Bedford, NH;2013-10-18 21:30:00;10 minutes;UFO Sighting, Bedford, NH On my way home driving, I saw three glowing orange orbs with a reddish aura around them in the sky above the power lines.  They were in a diagonal formation and gliding across the sky toward the tree line.   As I got closer, they were out of my line of sight and I turned down a back road to get a better view.   My 5 year old daughter and I got out of the car and we looked up to see them overhead, now in a horizontal pattern, soundless, moving toward the direction of the moon.  As quickly as we saw them, they disappeared, vanishing from sight.   It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen.;42.9429;-71.5221999999999
