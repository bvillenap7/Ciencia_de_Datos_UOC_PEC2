Witnessed a pulsing light moving faster than an aircraft far in the distance. The sky was overcast and the craft was well below the cloud ceiling. It was the only light in the sky. I watched as it began to move faster, then it suddenly changed course heading more torward my position. It sped up more, flashing more rapidly. There was no sound. It was quickly much closer to where I was standing. It passed overhead moving faster in a zig-zag pattern, still no sound, blinking wildly and then suddenly disappeared.;43.6238;-72.132
