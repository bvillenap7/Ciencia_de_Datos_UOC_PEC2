Triangle of white lights and a large red strobe orb in Enfield NH;2019-11-21 10:30:00;4 minutes;Triangle of white lights and a large red strobe orb in Enfield NH A large object crossed the sky from East to West over Enfield, NH, tonight.  The object was accompanied by a jet engine sound so at first I assumed it was a jet in the area.  However, after observing for a few minutes it was apparent this wasnâ€™t a regular plane.  The object consisted of five small white lights in the shape of a triangle.  In the center was a very large red light flashing on and off in a fade pattern with approximately a one second interval.   Unlike a standard engine, which experiences a pitch change from doplar affect, the pitch of this engine was unchanging.  As I watched the object I expected at some point to see the green navigation lights or the regular strobe lights seen on an airplane but they never appeared, and the red strobe did not flash in the typical. Activation strobe pattern of 3-5 on with a 2 second test.  At the end of observation (maybe twenty miles west of my location) it completely disappeared, with all lights extinguishing in unison.;43.6238;-72.132
