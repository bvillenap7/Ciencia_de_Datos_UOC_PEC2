Silent, flashing light, moving in very fast S-pattern in Enfield, NH;2013-08-26 23:00:00;15 seconds;Silent, flashing light, moving in very fast S-pattern in Enfield, NH It was a very quick sighting. Basically, I spotted it through the top of a tree at first. It appeared to be an airplane with one flashing light and the altitude it was at seemed to make sense.  However, the speed seemed unusual for an airplane.  I thought it might be a satellite, but realized the sky was completely overcast. So this kept me watching it trying to figure out what it was. It came into plain view, from behind the tree and I could see it moving parallel to the ground, but slightly away from my point of view.  It was a bright flashing light, that seemed to flash in a pattern of threes.  But then it suddenly turned more in my direction and seemed to speed up.  It came from what I thought was some distance at first, but then it was practically overhead in a matter of a couple of seconds.  It did a very flitty S-pattern maneuver that almost seemed insect like, but much less random. As it passed over head, its appearance didn't seem to change - still flashing, white light. The scale did appear to change, logically, as it was now closer to my position.  It was also silent the entire time. It then simply vanished. It didn't not speed away, but simply vanished as if someone flipped off the light switch.;43.6238;-72.132
