Flashlight made UFO disappear;2014-05-03 21:30:00;3-5 min;Flashlight made UFO disappear On May 3, 2014, two bright orange spherical objects where observed in the Northern sky and seemed static.   Once they began moving in contrast to the other stars is when they became an interest, as they seemed to become larger and smaller and moved in a triangular area in the sky.   It was assumed they were possibly paper lanterns or something similar, but when a high lumen flashlight was aimed on one, it got continually smaller until it disappeared.   The flash light was then aimed at the second light which also quickly shrank and disappeared.;42.8374;-71.1566
