UFO making impossible flight path- NH- upper CT river valley;2007-07-03 22:30:00;10-15 seconds;UFO making impossible flight path- NH- upper CT river valley Looked like a medium-brightness star, moving approximately 4-5 times the speed of a jet. It paused, made an impossible 90 degree turn, and shot rapidly across the sky, paused again, and then made another 90 degree turn. It then slowly circled around (like reversing direction), then made another impossible turn in the opposite direction at a rapid rate. No noise, was very high in the sky. So absolutely cannot be confused with a firefly, fireworks, etc. Afterwards, witnessed a regular plane crossing the sky in the direction of where the object was. Not sure if it was a coincidence or if it was trying to follow the object.;44.3145000000002;-71.7785999999998
Bright flash of light, turning to pinpoint  of light that traveled silently and quickly through night sky of NH.;2007-08-14 21:40:00;1 minute;Bright flash of light, turning to pinpoint  of light that traveled silently and quickly through night sky of NH. At 9:40 pm, husband and wife were meteor watching when a bright flash of white light (as if someone snapped a photo with a large flash) from the Southern sky caught our attention. We noted a small pinpoint of light traveling quickly from the flashâ€™s point of origin. The object was too high to be a plane and silent. It traveled in an arc overhead at a steady rate of speed from South to North until we lost sight of it over the mountains into Canada.  We originally thought that it might be the space shuttle, but after checking the NASA channel realized the shuttle was still docked at the space station and not orbiting. We are first time posters and have never seen anything prior to last night to warrant a report. Interested to know if other people witnessed anything similar in the area.;44.3145000000002;-71.7785999999998
