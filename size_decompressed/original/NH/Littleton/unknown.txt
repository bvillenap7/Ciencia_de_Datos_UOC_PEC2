Square pulsing glow;2007-12-14 23:00:00;15 min.;Square pulsing glow My attention was drawn to an unusual shape in the sky, a perfect square.  This square of light pulsed on and off without regularity.  For instance, it may have glowed for five seconds, then didn’t for three seconds, glowed again for two seconds, then didn’t for seven, etc.  I watched this for approximately five minutes before I went for my camera.  Zooming in on the photo, I can see a string of lights that may be windows.  Perhaps it is a plane surrounded by strange cloud conditions that would make it appear to be very square.
