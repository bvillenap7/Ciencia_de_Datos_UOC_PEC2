white blinking lights flying very close together;2005-09-02 22:30:00;3-5 minutes;While sky watching on a hill in Tilton, at 10:30 PM we saw 4 or 5 white blinking lights flying very close together.   Each light appeared to move up, down, sideways, independant of the others tight manuevers, but as a group moved slowly across the horizon out of view.;43.4584;-71.5726
