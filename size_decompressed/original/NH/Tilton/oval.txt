A yellow/orange glowing oval shaped object flew east to west across a blue sky in downtown Tilton, NH. (coordinates 43.444137, -71.586744) leaving two large white puffy condensation trails in its wake.  The object appeared to be flying in an upward trajectory of about 10 degrees from my perspective.  After 15 seconds the object got far enough away that it looked like it was flying away from me when the huge condensations trails behind the oval glowing orb stopped and the object disappeared.  The yellow-orange object moved faster than any aircraft Iâ€™ve ever witnessed at a similar altitude with a disproportionately large condensation trail compared to the size of the craft and it made no noise.;43.4584;-71.5726
