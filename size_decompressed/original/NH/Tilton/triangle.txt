When we were done shopping and came outside, we both noticed how awesome the sky was.  I have really never seen the sky like this, then again I am always taking pictures of the sky.  Anyways, I snapped 6 good ones and left.  What I found a couple days later is pretty wild.  3 out of the 6 look pretty obvious and 1 is unexplainable to me, but I'm no c picture expert.  I am not someone looking for attention I don't believe in ghosts and I barely believe in aliens.  I am one of those people that needs hardcore facts.  So I really need someone to look at these.;43.4584;-71.5726
