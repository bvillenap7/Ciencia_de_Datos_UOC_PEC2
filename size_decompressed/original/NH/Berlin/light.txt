bright lights in the sky that jump around and vanish;2008-09-23 19:45:00;5-10 seconds;bright lights in the sky that jump around and vanish Not sure what I saw, but it was different than anything I have seen before.  I was travelling NW and saw a bright light (airplane like, but not blinking and extremely bright) in the sky.  Then it was joined by 2 more of the same look.  The 3 lights moved around each other.  I thought that if they were planes that they would crash.  Then they vanished. I drove on.  A few miles down the road I saw it again, except that the 3 lights were playing a leapfrog for 5-10 seconds and then vanished.  I waited for about ten minutes.  Then I just saw one of the lights for appx. 2-3 seconds and it vanished.  I called home to report what I saw and my significant other was freiked out!!! A co-worker described seeing the same thing about 2 nights ago appx. 40 miles away.  Again, not sure what it was...  came home punched in UFO sightings on the net and found your site.  I am a very sane person.  If someone reads this please tell me that we are experiencing a meteor shower or something.  If not... then what is it?????;44.4822;-71.1940000000002

I went out to my porch and looked into the sky and coming into view I now saw 2 lights coasting west and then a 3rd light came up to the other three and they all continued west until fading from view.  I heard now sound just the 3 strange lights moving east to west.;44.4822;-71.1940000000002
