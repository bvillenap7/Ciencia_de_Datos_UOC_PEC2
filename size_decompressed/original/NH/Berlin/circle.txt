Large orange light in sky over berlin nh;2012-09-02 20:30:00;3 minutes;large orange light in sky over berlin nh I went outside for a cigarette and my two children and two nephews followed me out to get some fresh air.  As I lit my cigarette my daughter says to me, daddy whats that in the sky that don’t look like a airplane (we see a lot of air planes in the night sky) that’s weird.  So I looked up and saw a orange circular object traveling through the sky.  It was about 5 times larger than any star.  The object traveled from east to west very slowly for about 3 mins then faded away.;44.4822;-71.1940000000002

While walking to my vehicle looking at the moon I seen a bright gold colored light left of the moon think this was Venus I thought wow nice view then the light faded out all the time I was hearing what sounded like Jet engines but seen no contrails or anything.  I put my stuff in the vehicle still hearing the engine noise suddenly four very large gold color lights reappeared in the sky just left of the moon and faded in and out then disappeared I continued to watch the sky as I could hear the engine noise but could not see anything.  The moon was almost full and bright and the sky was clear as the the sun was still peaking light over the mountains so the stars were not yet visible.   new development I can hear the same engine noises  but see nothing sky still clear it is 22:27  The engine noise sounds as if your were testing a jet engine on a stand.;44.4822;-71.1940000000002
