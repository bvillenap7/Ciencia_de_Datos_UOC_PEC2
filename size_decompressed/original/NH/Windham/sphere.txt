Intelligent glowing ball close encounter in Windham, NH;1992-07-04 20:00:00;~ 5 seconds;Intelligent glowing ball close encounter in Windham, NH While driving down Range Rd just after passing the RT93 overpasses, myself and my passenger ((name deleted)), observed a basketball sized bright orange colored glowing ball stationary on the road near were the farm was, (now soccer fields I believe). It was approx 3 ft off the tar. I saw it clearly from approx 300 ft away and it came towards my vehicle at a rapid rate of speed. All the time maintaning the same height off the road, 3ft. It seemed intelligent due to the fact that it followed the contour of the road perfectly, as the road was slightly curvy and hilly. As it past by me within 3 ft I noticed no sounds or extra illumination or smells inside my truck. It traveled very fast. Immediately afterwards I asked ((name deleted)) what he saw. He said a glowing ball in the road that came towards us. Just 1000' ahead on Range rd were about 4 or 5 adults waiting to see the start of the fireworks at Canobie lake park. I wish I had asked them if they had seen anything unusual. But I did'nt stop. I had ((name deleted)) to collaberate what I saw that July 4th, 1992 evening 12 years ago. It was not flaming like a Roman Candle balland was not hot or burning or changing colors like fireworks. If this thing had not come so close and just gone the other way, I would have brushed it off and dismissed and forgotten it. But the behavior was undoubtly intelligent as it followed the road like a Cruise missile you could say. The weather was clear and still. Lighting was good, pre dusk.;42.801;-71.3085
