Fireball sphere seen at Canobie Lake moving over the trees.;2014-07-05 21:30:00;25 seconds;fireball sphere seen at Canobie lake moving over the trees. We were watching the fireworks over Canobie lake and my daughter noticed something in the sky.  When we all looked up, there was a sphere going across the sky right above the tree line. The color was like a fire.  It was moving to slow to be a meteor and to fast to be a Chinese lantern.  Never seen anything like this in my life.  Very strange, but cool to observe.;42.801;-71.3085
