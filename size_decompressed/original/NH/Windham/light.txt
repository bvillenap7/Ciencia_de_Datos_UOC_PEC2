Bright white flash on the southwestern horizon;2010-01-07 17:45:00;2 seconds;Bright white flash on the southwestern horizon I was travelling on I-93 southbound in southern NH (in Windham near exit 3)  when I saw a bright white flash pulsate about 3-4 times for about 3 seconds off to the southwestern horizon.  It was a clear night with no clouds as stars were visible above my head.  I ruled out lightning as no storms or clouds were in the area.  There were no follow up flashes to the event.;42.801;-71.3085
