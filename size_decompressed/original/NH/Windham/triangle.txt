Multiple UFO's spotted flying out of unknown light.;2016-03-29 20:00:00;1 minute;Multiple UFO's spotted flying out of unknown light. Driving to the store, I looked out my driver side window to see an odd object with white lights flying very fast over the building.  By the time I had parked the original object had disappeared and another black object began flying from the other direction toward me and the others in my car.   The object flew straight over us making an almost silent hum.   It then turned almost how a fighter jet would bank and quickly disappeared out of sight.   When I got home I further inspected the sky from my backyard and could make out small little lights darting across the sky to a much bigger light too bright to be a star.;42.801;-71.3085
Ufo seen august 25th 2020!;2020-08-25 09:10:00;1 minute;Ufo seen august 25th 2020! I was having a late night swim with my two children. It was about 9:10 when all of the sudden we seen three very bright circular lights from a distance coming towards us at a very fast speed.  This was much closer than a plane would ever come and definitely not the shape or sound of any plane.  It hovered diagonally above us for a quick moment then suddenly it took a sharp right turn and it was gone.  As of then, we noticed that the shape was triangular.  From the back, there  were two lights in the back that were not as bright as the three in front.  As far as I knew ufo’s were circular, this object appeared that way from the distance, from the back was when I noticed that it had a triangular shape to it.  Definitely nothing we have ever seen!;42.801;-71.3085
2nd sighting triangular shape aircraft saw location!;2020-09-22 19:42:00;6 minutes;2nd sighting triangular shape aircraft saw location! Today is September 22,2020 I can hardly believe I am reporting another ufo sighting after nearly 2 months from the last one seen.  The time was 7:42ish pm and ‘this time i was ready! I got video footage, however what was recorded on camera was not what I was seeing with my naked eye .Fortunately there was one slight second I dropped the phone and got a clear image of the ufo. Both times seeing the ufo it appears from the distance a very bright moving moon or sun. The speed is slow but definitely this time was coming from a much further distance. At first sight there was no noise just a very bright light heading towards me at a somewhat slow speed. When I grabbed my phone to record it, for whatever reason it showed up as at first one circular light and as it came closer 2 intertwining lights . There were a few possibly even more blinking lights. I believe red white and blue . The video footage I got with the camera can be seen showing a flash but not very det! ailed in its color. Here is what I captured. I managed to slow the video down and capture the ufo the way it actually looked from my view. However like I said the video camera picked up a totally different image.;42.801;-71.3085
