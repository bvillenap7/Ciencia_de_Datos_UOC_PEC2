I was outside kicking a soccer ball around when I heard a strange noise, sort of a buzzing sound. I looked around the sky and spotted an oval shaped blakc aircraft with red lights spinning around the edge of it. It was getting closer to the ground, maybe two miles away from me. Some kind of dark blue beam light came from the bottom of the aircraft and hit the ground for about 5 seconds. The beam went away, the ship accended into the air, and then it took off, very slowly for an aircraft. It was a very visible sighting, unforunatly, I did not have any camera or phone with me, so I could not get actual proof.;42.801;-71.3085
