Dog started barking, so I went outside to investigate.  While standing on the front porch, a light appeared from the sky and started going up and down the river.  Sort of reminded me of a search light on a helicopter, which was my first thought.  Then I realized, there wasn't any helicopter sounds.  Tried to see where the light was coming from, but the conditions prevented viewing of any object.  The light just looked like it was coming straight down out of the clouds/mist.  This lasted approx. 5 minutes and then the light disappeared.;44.2168;-71.8991
