I saw something in the sky that was not a plane,meteor,or satelite;2012-04-20 21:00:00;30  seconds;I saw something in the sky that was not a plane,meteor,or satelite At around 9:00 pm (eastern),I was standing outside with two friends talking.  I noticed what at first looked like a plane moving VERY fast.It was a small white light like a star.  It had no red or green running lights,nor did it have strobes.It no sound.  I see all types of aircraft fly over the houseprivate, commercial, and military.  A passenger jet cruising at 35,000 feet will take about five minutes to cross the horizon.  military fighters at low altitude will cross in about 45 seconds.  (and make a lot of noise).   High altitude passenger jets and military cargo jets are both audible when they fly overhead.  What we saw crossed the sky in about 30 seconds and made absolutely no noise.It was moving much too slow to be a meteor or a sattelite.  The most extraordinary part was the extreme turns this object made.  What I saw was at a very high altitude and shifted VERY sharply to the left,then back to the right in a split second.  I am very familliar with all types of aircraft.  (I watch the Military Channel all the time) THIS WAS NOT A PLANE.  This happened at the top of Waukeena Lake Rd. in Danbury, NH;43.5103;-71.8683
