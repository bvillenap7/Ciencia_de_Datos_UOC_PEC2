Saw two cigar-shaped objects flying low in Danbury, NH.;2005-10-07 20:00:00;5 seconds;Saw two cigar-shaped objects flying low in Danbury, NH. I was sitting in our outdoor hot tub, and saw two cigar-shaped objects moving quickly above the tree line.  They were close together and both where lit up with white light and a orange circle in the middle.  They also where silent.   This happened a long time ago and I'm not sure on the exact date.  I just want to make a report in case someone else has seen similar objects. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
