It traveled at a 45 degree angle from upper right to lower left.   Then 5 minutes later in the location the light from the meteorite disappeared a perfectly clear v shaped light appeared with a smaller fuzzy light dot above it.   This second object remained in the same location for about 30 seconds to 1 minute before going dark (as if someone hit a light switch).;43.5513;-71.02
