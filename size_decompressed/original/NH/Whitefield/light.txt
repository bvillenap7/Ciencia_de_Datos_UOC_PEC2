((NUFORC Note:  Probably a twinkling star.  PD))  Satellite pulsing with color?;2005-10-03 21:00:00;4 Hours;Satellite pulsing with color? The object looked an appeared to be at a similar distance as a star.  However, it pulsed with light and color (white, red, and blue).  It looked similar to the running lights of a plane but it was too far away and it was hovering.  After hours of observation, we realized it was moving very slowly, as if orbiting the Earth.  When a friend arrived with binoculars, in spite of shakiness, we learned it was geometric in design.  One description was of four triangles pointed outward with different pulses of light.  Another description compared it to a Rubic's cubic rotating back and forth, the different squares puling with light. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably a twinkling star.  PD));44.3717;-71.6085
Softball  shaped white lights in the sky;2008-09-17 20:00:00;1 min;Softball  shaped white lights in the sky My husband and I were camping in Whitefield NH.Sept17th-23rd 2008. The first night we saw a bunch of white lights above the trees next to us. One would appear and as it was fading out another light would appear a few feet over so we were seeing two at a time a total of six. It did this into a U-shaped pattern.Maybe a hundred feet side ways they went. The lights were a bit above tree top high, about softball shaped size, and no sounds were heard.Moving slow. The second night i was star watching with my husband, he didn't see it this time. It was in the sky above my head. Three white lights all in a row, and it looked like there was a rod connecting them. As i told my husband to look, the lights faded out, but left a fog line where it was then that dissapeared. My husband saw the fog line.;44.3717;-71.6085
