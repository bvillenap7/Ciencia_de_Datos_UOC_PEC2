We first observed a flashing light in the sky over the tree line.  Blue, yellow, red and green lights were flashing on what seemed to be a craft.  The light seemed to hover around quickly moving from one point to another within a small area.   A few minutes later three blue lights appeared to the right of the original lights and were in a equally spaced line.   Minutes later the original light had moved substantially higher and to the left while the three lights remained in the same area.  After heading inside for a bit (being physically shaken and paranoid) we returned back to see that all four lights were no longer visible.;42.7384;-71.6663
