Multiple Orbs w/ Pulsating Halos over different towns.;2016-03-06 18:30:00;1 hour;Multiple Orbs w/ Pulsating Halos over different towns The wife and I walked out of Best Buy (located in the Target/Best Buy mini mall across from the Steeplegate Mall) and saw a giant orb with a pulsating halo around it.  It was flying East between the Steeplegate Mall and Michael's Crafts.  We filmed it for a good minute or so before it vanished. On the way home, while driving on RTE 28, we caught sight of the same object flying over Pittsfield, NH.  The object was less round and much flatter, and we followed it into the center of Pittsfield.  We parked in the Riteaid parking lot facing Jack's Pizza.  The flat, saucer-like object flew silently in the sky.  I was able to snap two photos of the object before it vanished. Thinking it was over, my wife and I got back into the car and back on to RTE 28 to head home.  Right before Blueberry Station (where the billboard is by the Pittsfield intersection), we caught sight of three more orbs, and one was quite large, orange in color, and it moved very slowly like the others.   I was able to capture the much larger orange orb on camera before my device ran out of storage. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I noticed to the north west, perhaps above egal square that there were two dark objects.  The sKY wasnt yet black so they were very easy to see.  My first thought were that they were ballonons.  But they were hovering in one spot and I noticed one began to gyrate like a coin flipping, first from side to side,  I looked down to grab my phone and when i looked back there was only one.   I got outta my truck told the people to record it cause my phone was dead they saI'd it waa too dark aND it wouldnt record...  The ufo was slowly spinning like you flip a coin.  Stopping then gyrating again in each direction.  Then stop and doing it side ways like a coin. But really slow. Like a spin per 5 seconds.  Then it just shrunk, or took off directly away from me.. it just diminished into nothing. I watched it just shrink in one spot.  It just disappeared, no sound, no lights, just a dark obect. 3 girls were stari! ng at it, and staring at me, literally like wtf was that word for word.  They were as astonished as i was.  but I was so frustrated my phone was dead, I think I must have swore from the main st theatre where they do plays,  all the way to cumbies.  It was amazing..;43.2326750000001;-71.5580985294118
