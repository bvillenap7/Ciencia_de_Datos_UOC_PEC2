1 straight fire like cylinder seen for 2 seconds and vanished.;2015-05-01 21:07:00;2 seconds;1 straight fire like cylinder seen for 2 seconds and vanished Stepped outside for an after dinner cigarette.  I look up and for 2 seconds I see a fire go from the southwest to northeast for about 1/4 mile really fast and disappear.   I thought at first it was a shooting star but then I realized it was too close to the earth for it to be a star or plane.;43.2326750000001;-71.5580985294118

All three forming a triangle shape.  Suddenly the bigger light slowly moved towards the other two (that were still).  After a few seconds, they all stood there, and proceeded to dissipate into the foggy sky. Meanwhile at another location, relatives to the witnesses have experienced unusual occurrences while walking their pets.  The same didn't feel comfortable outside.  Two dogs that are usually very excited to go out.  They happened to be outside at the same time of the event (coincidentally).;43.2326750000001;-71.5580985294118
