Bright White Cigar-Disk Shape Objected Spotted Over Concord, NH;2008-02-04 11:45:00;5-6 Seconds;Bright White Cigar-Disk Shape Objected Spotted Over Concord, NH Spotted a bright white cigar-shaped body cross the sky from a window in my classroom today. I stood up to gain a better view at which point student in front of me asked if I had seen the object as well. The object was in view for no more 5-6 seconds. The object was not a reflection because it passed behind a tree's several branches and behind the projecting corner of the building I was in at the time.  Object appeared to be moving too fast to be far away, i.e. if it were a plane at the distance estimated the plane was moving faster then any plane I have ever seen.  If it were closer then I have estimated I should have been able to see wings or a tail. The object appeared to not be falling from the sky nor racing upwards but maintained a steady lateral vector.;43.2326750000001;-71.5580985294118
