Three round lights in a row, middle light red and flashing, object seen was trapezoid in shape.;2018-01-13 20:30:00;unknown;Three round lights in a row, middle light red and flashing, object seen was trapezoid in shape. My boyfriend and I were driving from exit 16 to get onto I-93 South.  Over what approximately would be concord quarries, I observed three round lights in a row, the middle one was red and blinking.  I never took my eyes off of the lights.  It was not traveling like a plane or helicopter, over course of approximately two minutes the lights hovered closer and closer until they were very large and above the car.  I could not determine what its mode of locomotion was, the object made no noise.   Quite suddenly it was over the car and I looked up and out and was confused, as all I saw were the three lights.  Then I widened my range of vision and realized the three lights were at the center base of an alarming large air craft just over head.  The shape can be closest described as trapezoid in nature.  The vessel was moving and I lost sight of it as it traveled over the top of the car.   Unfortunately, we had to get off the highway at the next exit and I was unable to track this object any further.;43.2326750000001;-71.5580985294118
