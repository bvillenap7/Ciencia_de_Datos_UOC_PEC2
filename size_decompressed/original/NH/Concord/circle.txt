Want to see a u.f.o? Move to New Hampshire!;2001-06-15 23:00:00;0:00;Want to see a u.f.o? Move to New Hampshire! I am a bartender, (and a amateur ufoligist who has had at least 4-5 unexplainable sightings) and I was taking out the garbage from my shift on a patio bar for the night. It was bike week at Laconia N.H, so, there were alot of people around. Usually the main bar is buisier, but we had a band out in the back of the restaraunt so there was not one soul on the front deck. Anyways, while takeing the garbage out, I looked up in the sky, as I often do, and noticed a star that was unusually bright sitting next to venus, which sits in the same spot every night at that same time in the southern sky, or pretty close to it. The star seemed very bright and as I said to my self, boy, that's a weird star?!? the brightness came down to the normal stars surrounding it, ( which in New Hampshire in a dark part of town can be pretty spectacular for a boy growing up in the subburbs of chicago for most of his life!). At that moment the star, or what it at fist appeard to be, gradually sped strait up into the atmosphere. In other words, It ascended rapidly, but not to fast, into the sky as if saying,  time to go! This is the second sighting I have wittnesed in this area. The first being a blue star sitting amongst the rest, and the speeding up into the atmosphere at an unimaginable rate of speed. I am convinced that these craft I have seen are not of this earth and are being shown to me for a reason. I hope this report helps to bring the realization that we are not alone in this universe to those who are blinded by the upbringing and political belives of society.;43.2326750000001;-71.5580985294118
