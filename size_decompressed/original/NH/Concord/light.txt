She said it was kind of like a cars headlight! I asked her if it might have been an Airplane and she said no way that thing was faster than anything I have ever seen and it made no sound ! ((NUFORC Note:  Without more details than those provided in this report, it is difficult to know what the witness observed.  We are approaching the date of the peak of the annual Persied Meteor shower, so the object may have been a meteor.  PD));43.2326750000001;-71.5580985294118

Both were bright, white and circular. They were both moving at the same speed, with tails behind them.  They were quite large in the sky. After about 5 seconds, they slowly faded out. I've never seen anything like it.;43.2326750000001;-71.5580985294118

Blinking white light moving very erratically.;2017-12-28 18:45:00;10 minutes;Blinking white light moving very erratically. My wife and I spotted a blinking white light that looked like an aircraft in the northern sky. The blinking light originally moved like an airplane but it would then be erratic, disappearing for a moment then reappearing a ways away from where it was last seen and moving in a different direction that it was originally traveling.  At times it would be stationary then begin moving again. Location and direction seemed to be completely random although it remained mainly in the same general area. We watched it for well over five minutes while driving on the interstate.  At one point it appeared to move to a new area about fifteen degrees away from the original location then stopped altogether.;43.2326750000001;-71.5580985294118

At first I thought it was plane but I saw no flight lights and it was flying too low and slow.  The first one was about 1/2 mile away.  The other was approximately 4-5 miles behind it.  They were both flying North.  No sound and window was partly open.;43.2326750000001;-71.5580985294118
