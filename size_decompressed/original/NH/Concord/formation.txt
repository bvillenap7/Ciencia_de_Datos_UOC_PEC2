Quick spiral flying south over Concord, NH;2012-11-13 15:50:00;5 minutes;Quick spiral flying south over Concord, NH At Mckee Square in Concord facing east.  First saw a single light moving at a distance. Assumed at first was aircraft over airport area.  Object moved in a southernly direction.   After noticing object was going too fast for a light aircraft at that distance, and too low for a larger aircraft, noticed a spiral formation coming behind it also moving south.  Appeared to be a spiral moving upwards, heading south.  Highly visible due to heavy cloud backdrop.  Light seemed to be reflection of sunlight from partially clear sky in west. I am an open minded person, I can argue both for a weather phenomena, or for some type of operated craft.  As I have never seen nor heard of a man made craft in this situation, nor observed such a weather based phenomena before, I decided to post.;43.2326750000001;-71.5580985294118
