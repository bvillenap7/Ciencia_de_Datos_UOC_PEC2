Bright blending lights;2002-01-16 22:00:00;10 minutes;Bright blending lights Location: Fremont NH, Route 107 (Main St.) My wife came in to ask me to come outside and look at a ball of light that had been just sitting across the street that she had observed while taking the dogs out. I came out to actually find 2 bright balls of light no more than 2000 feet in front of me across the street from my house where a sand pit is located. They blended the colors of red, green, blue and white. The larger of the 2 was approx. 3 car lengths in a circle and the smaller was about 2 car lengths in a circle. they were about 50ft above the tree tops. The smaller of the two fled N.E. at a high rate of speed and the other one hovered above the tree tops. It hovered back and forth and up and down for about 8 mins. And the wierd thing was it made NO SOUNDS!!! Not a hum, Not a wisper!!!!then it gradually continued over Rte 107 and headed off toward Danville NH area at approx. 20-25 MPH. It stayed at about 50 feet above the trees. After researching, I found that I have a power grid 1/2 mile N.W. of my house and there have been multiple sightings there dating back to 1965!!;42.9818;-71.1221
