Very large floating aircraft with nav-lights. Possibly a military test craft.  ((anonymous report));2019-05-08 21:00:00;Continuing up till right ;Very large floating aircraft with nav-lights. Possibly a military test craft. I saw a large aircraft hovering mid air over Freemont, New Hampshire.  It had green and red nav-lights, so it probably is legit and not some alien craft.  It was larger than any airplanes I've ever seen.  Because it was night time, I couldn't quite make out what the craft was.  The only thing I am sure of is that it is a large, wide, object.  I don't think there is anything to worry about.  It is probably a test aircraft that military produced.  It had nav-lights.  What alien would put human-made nav-lights on his craft?
