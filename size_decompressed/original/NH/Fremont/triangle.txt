There wasn't a sound in the air. Now I was sitting on my couch on the laptop and watching TV. I was sitting next to a window and noticed lights that made a triangle form. I then proceeded to go to my front porch and got a better look. The “craft” that I saw was triangle with a light on each point and one in the exact center blinking.  It was moving from north-north west to south-south east.  The air was rather still and a small breeze blew. The breeze wasn’t strong enough to make enough sound, but the air was very quiet.  The air was so quiet that this craft would’ve been heard.  It also was flying rather low. Way below commercial airliner height.  I would say 2,500-8,500 feet.  The color of the aircraft would probably be a darker color like a grey, naval blue, black or dark color but I couldn’t completely tell because of the minimal light.  The time of day it was dark. After the craft flying past the front part my house I had to run to the back porch. Once again I saw the same craft coming out of the trees next to my house.  I watched it until it started to shrink from the distance. Then it disappeared.  One of my family members also saw it but denied it was anything, not even an airplane. This was incredible different to an airplane for many reasons and we live near three major airports so I know what an airplane flies and that they make noise. After the craft diappeared the wind picked up right away and got cold. There was no noise what so ever. This craft had no traits of an airplane.;42.9818;-71.1221
