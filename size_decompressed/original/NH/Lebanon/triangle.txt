UFO Sighting 1978 In November of 1978    I was driving from Lebanon, NH, onto Route 120 to take a right onto I89 South.  In the distant sky, in front of me, I saw a series of blinking white lights.  They looked to be slightly bigger than the size of a star.  There was one light that moved in varying patterns in the sky.  It moved in a way that no other aircraft of ours has the capability to do.  I was mesmerized. I turned onto Interstate 89 and headed south about a mile or so.  I was watching behind me as I saw the light staying in the sky.  Then in a split second the light was right next to me in the northbound lane.  It did this two more times â€“ staying behind a mile or two and then there it was, next to me. I turned off the interstate and turned left up a road and then into the family driveway.  When I got out of the car the triangle shape UFO was there.  It was totally silent moving slowly down toward the ground.  There was a red light in the center of the bottom of the ship that glowed outward.  My family came to the door and screamed to come in.  The ship went up and away without making any sound.  Three weeks later, the ship returned to the other side of our driveway and descended lower than the first time.  Because it was lower the triangle shape was clearer and it still had the red light in the center of the bottom of the triangle.  A relative was with me and pushed me toward the door of the house to get away from it.  The ship took off, again without a sound.  That was the last time I saw this type of ship.
