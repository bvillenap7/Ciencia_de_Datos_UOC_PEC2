Orange glowing orb slowly moving upward then disappeared.;2014-01-10 20:30:00;3-5 minutes;Orange glowing orb slowly moving upward then disappeared. Was driving north when the passenger noticed an orange glowing orb hovering right next to the Indian on the island across from MVSB.   I turned around in MVSB to watch and figure out what it was.  Slowly it started to move upwards, slightly to the left, almost as if gravity was not an issue.  It would pause, then continue upward.  It moved very slow and would move slightly from left to right.  Continued upward, stopped a few stories high, then disappeared.  There was no sound.;43.6314;-71.5052999999999
