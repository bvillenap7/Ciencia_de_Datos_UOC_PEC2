Red light hovering over Winnisquam;2007-08-12 00:30:00;1 hour;Red light hovering over Winnisquam Around 11:30PM I heard a noise that sounded as if it were something hovering over the lake house.  The sound was as if there had been some massive object above the house, lasting about 5 minutes.  After about a half-hour I was still unable to sleep and so I went to another room to watch TV.  I decided to step outside to check out the meteors (hoping to see some more).  Around 12:30 I looked across the lake and saw a strange red light hovering over the shoreline.  It moved slightly from time to time, as if it were trying to balance itself out again.  A bit closer and to the left there was another object moving in a similar manner, which was white. I watched the red light for a while it would sometimes drop and then more higher up again.  Also, every so often a flash of red and white light would appear on one side or another.  I at first hoped it would come near to me, and at one point it seemed to start to move closer but it made me slightly nervous. I felt a bit apprehensive and excited at the same time, and I felt that whatever it was could sense my reluctance toward it coming too close and it backed off.  Whatever it was felt out of this world to me and seemed to understand my anxiety.  Around 1 AM i went back inside, it was still hovering.;43.6314;-71.5052999999999
