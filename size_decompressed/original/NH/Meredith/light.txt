red/white twinkling light in eastern NH sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of a celestial body?  PD));2010-10-16 22:00:00;60 minutes;red/white twinkling light in eastern NH sky went outside to smoke and noticed exceptionally bright, twinkling star about four hands up from the treeline in the eastern sky.  Light appeared to be twinkling more energetically than typical star with what appared to be rapid flashes of red over red lights interspersed with white twinkling.  Object remained fixed in its location. Went inside for binoculars, which revealed more clearly that there were regular and rapid flashes of red and white light.  Object was located to the left of the moon and resembled airplane lights, but never changed position.  Checked back in an hour and object appeared to have faded to a dull orange-red glow with less twinkle.  Think it might have been an atmospheric effect, but it was unnerving the way it hovered there and flashed.  Jupiter? Mars? ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of a celestial body?

In a snowstorm, my 2 children and I observed 3 redish orange lites spinning and bouncing thru the snow very close to the ground.  I have never seen anything like it.;43.6314;-71.5052999999999
My friend and I were sitting outside. My friend noticed a light moving across the sky.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-27 20:40:00;3-6 minutes;My friend and I were sitting outside.  My friend noticed a light moving across the sky and pointed it out to me.  I thought it was a satellite.  But withing a few seconds there was another one and then another one and so on.  They all seemed to be flying in the same line. It looked as though they were flying in different lines.  But very close together and very close in line as well.  So much that you would certainly assume it was a group.  The ones we saw first the light seemed constant.  The ones to toward the end seemed to be changing. Almost blinking but it wasnt.  I immediately down went online to a flight tracking site to see the air traffic above my location and the closest plane was more than 40 miles away in a different direction.   And given the terrain where I live. It doesn't allow you to see that far across the horizon.  When I got no where with that I then went to a site showing satellite activity above location.  Again there wasn't anything above us.  After thinking about it more whatever it was or is.  Was at an extremely high altitude.  Much higher than  what passenger planes would fly at.  I honestly have no explanation for it.;43.6314;-71.5052999999999
