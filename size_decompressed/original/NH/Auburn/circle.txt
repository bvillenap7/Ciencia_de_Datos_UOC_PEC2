We saw two objects, both didn't move much in the 1 1/2 half. When they move they swayed, spiralled or zagged.  We saw lots of colors coming from them.  Blue, Green and Red dominated. When viewing one with binoculars you could see rows of windows.  We watched them til about 11:30 and both were still in the sky when we went to bed. ((NUFORC Note:  The changing colors suggest to us a twinkling star, but stars do not have two rows of windows.  PD));42.9933;-71.3486
