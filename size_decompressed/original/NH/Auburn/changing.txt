Hovering Obj. with bright lights that appeared to come from object with rows of windows.((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Sirius or Venus?  PD));2009-02-16 20:30:00;1 hour;Hovering Object with bright lights that appeared to come from object with rows of windows Went outside and saw a bright object coming towards me while I was in my driveway taking out the trash.  There was no noise. The object stopped and it looked like a bright star.  I went into my home and got my binoculars for a better look.  Observed a large object that was hovering.  The object had extreamly bright lights. Though the binoculars, it looks liked rows and rows of windows on a circular object.  The lights appeared to be coming out of the rows of windows, however, the locations of the lights would change which made the object appear to change shape.  I got another person to look through the binoculars and they observed the same thing. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Sirius or Venus?  PD));42.9933;-71.3486
