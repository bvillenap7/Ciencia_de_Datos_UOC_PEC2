Large ship seen over Durham, New Hampshire;2004-06-16 22:00:00;10 minutes;Large ship seen over Durham, New Hampshire I saw an enormous ship that was producing an electronic humming sound and had many lights and antennae protruding downward and moving across the sky at around 50,000ft.  It appeared to be made out of some sort of reddish metal, sort of like a orange, golden copper, a very obscure blend of colours.   It  moved across the sky for a bit then flashed and disappeared. Shortly thereafter, four jets shot across the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.1197;-70.9241

HUGE STAR looking craft (I guess, just one bright bright light)  One Light flew over head and then totally disappeared into thin air.;2015-02-06 18:00:00;30 seconds;HUGE STAR looking craft (I guess, just one bright bright light)  One Light flew over head and then totally disappeared into thin air. Looked Like a HUGE star that was really low over the sky, flew straight overhead of Middle of Durham, NH.   I was walking my dog down woodman road, looked up and coming from nowhere suddenly looked like A star was SUPER low flying at a medium speed overhead.  No blinking no multiple lights just as if a star had dropped down low and was floating over my head heading East.  I watched it fly over head for about thirty seconds and as it got a little past the spot where I was actually standing it just faded to nothing.  Absolutely did not go over tree line or fly so far it seemed as if i could not see it any more.  It was right over head and low and just disappeared.  CRAZIEST thing I have ever seen!!;43.1197;-70.9241
Hovering above the trees, then it just takes off;2017-07-26 22:00:00;15 seconds;Hovering above the trees, then it just takes off I'm driving on route 4 away from Portsmouth at about 10:00 at night.  There's only one other car on the road and it's in front of mine.  We get right up to wagon hill farm when the guy in front of me slams on the brakes.  I'm looking around trying to figure out why and I don't see anything.  Then I look up, and see it.   It was some kind of aircraft hovering mid air right above the trees just in front of the car in front of me.  It had bright white lights coming from the bottom of it, but because of the angle and how dark it was, it was difficult to determine its shape.  I could tell it was larger than the car in front of me, and mine as well.  It stayed hovering there for about 10-15 seconds and then it took off.  It went so fast, I could barely tell which direction it went in.  It went left toward the hill and then out of sight.
