Morphing object seen in the day in the same location a green-strobing object which was seen at night 2 weeks before.;2007-02-22 07:30:00;at least 15 mins;Morphing object seen in the day in the same location a green-strobing object which was seen at night 2 weeks before. Two weeks ago I observed a green strobing light in the sky.   There are no mountains in that direction as well as no radio towers.    Today, I observed an object in the sky in the same general area.   The object was round, and with the same strobing pattern/frequency as the object I previously saw, changed between a cigar shaped object oriented up and down, and the sphere.;43.1197;-70.9241
