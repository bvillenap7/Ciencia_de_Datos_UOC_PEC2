No noise from disc like object;1977-07-02 21:00:00;5 minutes;No noise from disc like object I have recently come to realize that when I was a young boy (10ish) I saw what I believe was not or could not be of earthly origins. I have been looking around off and on to see if anyone else did too. I am glad to have found this site. Be that as i may… Here it is.  My family vacationed at Hampton Beach N.H. pretty much every year during 4th of July week to watch/partake in the city funded fireworks display. This year was kind of special to me because &quotThe Commodores&quot were playing at the boardwalk that year. As luck would have it, I had the opportunity to watch them perform some of their tunes despite the fact that the venue was a 21 plus, ticket in hand establishment. I sneaked in and watched until they kicked me out. On the night that I saw this object…. I remember it was a few days before the fourth at around 8 pm to 9 pm. A typical thing we would do after dinner and boardwalk arcade fun is walked the long stretch of beach. With shoes in hand walking a southerly direction on the cold wet sand,  the object in question seemed to kind of appear just a few hundred feet out and a few hundred feet over the ocean. As it moved in the same direction as us its velocity was maybe three or four times the pace we kept. It seemed to effortlessly float along past us. It was disc shaped and very dark on the bottom like it was devoid or less than there if that makes any sense. It had lights that were rotating around it in a clockwise direction at a pace that seemed to match its forward velocity. Well not like a bunch of lights. More like one wide light that can only be described like a windshield wiper that leaves a dissipating light trail behind it as it moves forward. I was confused by this point. I! clearly remember questioning what I was seeing and my older siblings dismissing it as a balloon or a helicopter or a blimp or a blah blah blah. I also clearly remember saying that it can't be any of that because there was no noise coming from it Why cant we hear it? Where are the engines? even blimps have engines!! If there is one thing that makes me believe that I saw what I think I saw is the lack of noise it made. Even to this day I get freaked out thinking about how it made absolutely no noise.

Moon size, like object, quiet, white and bright August 1997-1999 3:00 AM. Any one else?;1998-08-13 03:00:00;3-5 seconds;Moon size, like object, quiet, white and bright August 1997-1999 3:00 AM. Any one else? Moon Like, bright, white Object...I set my alarm to get up to watch the Perseid meteor showers at approximately 2:30 AM. I saw a couple shooting stars from the front and rear of my house, respectively - (about 2 miles from the beach). 3:00 A.M. I decided to kick back with a blanket and pillow to view the unfortunate sparse meteors visible - when suddenly and quietly, a full moon sized object, as bright and intense as a full moon, moved swiftly above the whispy cloud line toward the South from North.(toward the Seabrook nuclear power plant) From the time it came over my house and disappeared over the trees and sky line was just a few seconds. I was stunned nad startled. I have seen hundreds of meteors including bolides - but never anything like this. I have watched the skies my entire life and am knowledgable in astronomy and the cosmos. I really am having a difficult time actually remembering the real year that this happened for some reason: 1997 - 1999. I have no clue why this has become so difficult to remember. I have posted other posts on the interenet - but they always disappear. I can not believe that no one else did not see this object! I contacted MUFON with not much interest. Anyone else see this? Please post.;42.939;-70.819

They traveled across the sky toward the eastern horizon over the ocean .  Wondered if anyone else saw them. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

25 small lights floating in air for 10 minutes.  Video recorded.;2015-01-17 00:00:00;5 minutes;25 small lights floating in air for 10 minutes.  Video recorded. On the above date and time I observed 25 small lights under some control from my front yard I took a video. They hung in the air rising and falling.  They then proceeded to the north in a slow manner.;42.939;-70.819
Circular white light.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellite??  PD));2017-07-11 21:51:00;1 minute;Circular white light. I observed a single white light traveling south to north from my balcony.  It was a pure white color and I lost sight of it even though the skyline was still visible for me.   I am sure it was not the ISS as it does not travel from the south to north.  It made no odd movements and continued on its path so a satellite explanation is possible.  However after viewing the ISS and its speed multiple times, I can say this tracked slower than the ISS usually does.   Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellite??  PD));42.939;-70.819
