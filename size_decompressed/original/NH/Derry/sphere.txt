The sighting lasted 3-5 seconds. Just long enough for me to query Did you see that?...It apeared much like a falling star with an exagerated descent except for the closeness and the size of the object. We both had never seen anything like it and were looking for other places such as news programs to see if others had seen this as well.we both have had many years in aviation and sky watching. This was a novel sighting for both of us. There were aircraft in the sky at this time as well in that we live close to MHT airport. We were hoping that maybe a pilot might have witnessed this.;42.8859000000001;-71.299
