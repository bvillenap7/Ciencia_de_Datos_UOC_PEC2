Observed round red light crossing over highway  - then hovering - changing shape - emitting small round blue lights;2002-08-15 01:00:00;60 seconds;Observed round red light crossing over highway  - then hovering - changing shape - emitting small round blue lights My 16 yr old son and I were driving down Rt.93S in Derry, NH at 1:00AM and witnessed a red light quickly cross the sky in front of us at a distance of about 200 yards and roughly 100 feet off the ground.  Seconds later the light crossed over us.  We both thought it was a police helicopter until we realized that it made no sound.  To our surprise the light then appeared again to our rear and hovered just to the side of road.  Slowing down to see what happened we observed the red light change shape several times - round to diamond to round to diamond to round...  Then two small round blue lights shot out of it and they all moved out of sight.  We wondered if it might be some sort of govt./military stealth aircraft.;42.8859000000001;-71.299
