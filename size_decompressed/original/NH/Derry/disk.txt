strange object hovering over tree line over old railroad bridge.;1991-01-14 20:30:00;2minutes;strange object hovering over tree line over old railroad bridge. The object seen was hovering above the treeline. It was a bright white in color with colored lights underneath. The spot where it was hovering was over an old railroad bridge.There is no access for vehicles other than a dirt bike. I could make out windows on the object also. It never moved except the colored lights underneath it flashed. There were two adults in the car at the time. The driver refused to stop or look at the object.I think for fear. Both adults in the car were normal middle class workers. The driver had an expierance in the desert in Navada in 1982. That same evening many people witnessed the same object.
