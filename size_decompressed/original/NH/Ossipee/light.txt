It haunts me still.  I did not remember the incident until some years later and tried feverishly to get in touch with the others that were with me, to no avail.  On February 6, 2000 I was watching the History channel at approx. 2:00 p.m. pacific time and saw to my astonishment a show describing the exact thing that I saw, the exact words that I had spoken during the event and the feeling that I had at the time and after when I had recalled the event in the early 90's. The incident on the show had occured in Alagash Maine, which is across the lake from where I saw this thing.  It looked to me as if the Sun was rising over the mountain, but it was nearing midnight.  I thought it was the end of the world.  Then, I said that it was only the sun and never thought any more about it until some years later.  I have been frightened by the thought of UFOs ever since even though I had never really considered them prior to my memory of that big bright light rising in the midnight sky.  The report that I saw on the History channel so disturbed me and also affirmed what I had seen to be true that I began writing the names of the others that had seen it down on paper as well as the names of the hypnotists that they saw.  It has taken me this long to ask for some assistance and perhaps just to let them know that what they saw, and felt also happened to me at the same time, although I cannot remember the exact date.  If there is anyone who can get me in touch with the men on this program I would more than greatly appreciate it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1976 apparently is approximate.  The Allegash event, and apparent abduction of five (?) young men in the Allegash Wilderness in the upper reaches of the State of Maine is a celebrated, and well documented, case.

Same as above is all I can tell you, but I have never seen anything like it ever before. It was brillant, fast, and turned at angles that defy normal airspace travel.;43.7688142857143;-71.1325228571429
i saw a big light just fade off into the sky.;2008-08-01 22:00:00;5 seconds;i saw a big light just fade off into the sky. i was in my drive way getting out of my my car and happened to look at all the stars in the sky, while i was looking i saw a bright light in the sky and it was bigger than any other star i had seen before but while i was looking at this star it took off really fast and left a trail of a bluish streak behind it and i know it was definitly not a plane or a satilite it was way too big for either and moved far too quick to be either a satilite or a plane.;43.7688142857143;-71.1325228571429
