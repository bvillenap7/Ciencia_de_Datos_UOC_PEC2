Night after night, more and more moving lights in sky in Littleton NH area;2007-09-20 22:00:00;Hours;Night after night, more and more moving lights in sky in Littleton NH area I am a pilot and for the last four nights I have seen moving lights in the western sky toward Vermont. The lights change color, move toward each other  and apart, dim and change from red to green. They act in ways not possible for aircraft.  While talking to friends and neighbors, I have learned that many people have seen them, in the Littleton, Franconia and even Gorham, NH areas.;44.2799;-71.6871
