Our family was in the hot tub in our backyard when I jokingly said look at the UFO.  But as the aircraft flew over us we actually thought it could be.  The shape was a triangle with the front space open, so sort of like a boomerang but more triangular.   Each of the points had a light.  One was blue, one was a greenish, and the back one alternated red and white.  It flew pretty low and slow, we could not hear anything.  The reason I am posting is that the shape was unlike anything I had seen for aircraft.  The triangular shape was open in the center and the two points were at the front and one point at the back.  There was nothing between the two front points either.   It was strange enough for us to think we needed to post here!;43.2272;-70.8339
