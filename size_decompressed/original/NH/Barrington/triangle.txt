Large triangular craft spotted above Barrrington, NH with large white and red lights.;2017-06-16 00:15:00;5 minutes;Large triangular craft spotted above Barrrington, NH with large white and red lights. Traveling east on 202 at around midnight after performing at an open mic in Maine, I looked up in the sky and noticed a large stationary object with very large bright lights.  One red on in the middle with three or so white lights around its edges.  It was so striking I pulled over and attempted to take some pictures and get a video.  I got one photo but was so shaken that my video did not record the craft.  It started moving towards my location and then banked east towards the seacoast.  That is when I could see the crafts outline.  The lights were very bright and in the night sky it looked metallic with sharp defined edges.  It flew like nothing I have ever witnessed and I have run large air shows at the former local airbase in the past.  Once it banked, I lost sight of the craft and was not able to find it again in the night sky.;43.2027;-71.0377
