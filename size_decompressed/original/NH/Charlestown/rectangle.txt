Silent triangle flying NW to SE, Three lights at the corners with flashing red light at the center;2020-08-20 21:30:00;45-60 seconds;Silent triangle flying NW to SE, Three lights at the corners with flashing red light at the center On 8/20/20  at approximately 2130 hrs. my two grand children and my self were outside where I was trying to show them some of the basic constellations. iI was very clear and bright and there was a new moon so it was very dark. I was showing them Ursa Major when I spotted a satellite traveling west to east across the sky just below the dipper. I saw another satellite following the first with about sixty degrees of separation.  As we were watching them I heard what sounded like a low level rumbling sound. I turned to the south and saw three lights in a triangle with a red flashing light in the center. They were traveling North West to South East. When I first saw them they were passed being overhead, maybe 65 to 70 degrees and I lost them at about 30 degrees when they passed behind some trees, the total time 45 to 60 seconds. I could not make out any shape, just the impression that it was solid between the lights. The size of the triangle was comparable to a quarter held at arms length. A rough estimate of altitude would be about ten thousand feet.  sThis did not look like a fixed wing aircraft, there was no noise after initial  the low rumble. The flash rate on the red light was under a second probably twice a second. The white lights were steady and less intense  than the ruby red light in the center. The craft did not exhibit any UFO characteristics, great speed, strange maneuvering, or abrupt disappearance. I think it was some sort of stealth aircraft but it fit the description of the triangle that have been reported.;43.2596;-72.3995
