If it looks like the ISS but isn't,  what is it?  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible flare from an Iridium satellite??  PD));2011-07-30 21:18:00;2 minutes;If it looks like the ISS but isn't,  what is it? On July 30, 2011, we were in Troy, NH, sitting at a campfire.   At approximately 9:18pm a moving object attracted our attention.  It moved at a rate similar to the ISS.  It had a greenish tint & was heading northward.  There was no sound. When it was overhead, it suddenly flared in intensity (perhaps 100 times brighter).  The flare reminded me of a cat's eye.   Then it faded as it continued northward & disappeared. (NUFORC Note:  Possible flare from an Iridium satellite, although such a flare lasts for only a few seconds, and they are white, not green.
