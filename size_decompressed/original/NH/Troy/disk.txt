I was driving southbound on rt 12 the object was visable to the east it was visable near the cemetery gazebo and outlook of  mount manadnock about 5 miles out there were very bright lights around the edge of the  disk shape and smaller lights between that were blue in color and green.  I stopped the vehicle and watched for 5 minutes then the object flew extremely fast it was a quick flash of light and then it was hovering over the cemetery we seen the object from about twenty feet away..it was very clearly not a plane nor a helicopter ..but a circular disk shaped object...silently hovering then it flashed after 5 more minutes and was out of sight heading southwest towards deerfield ma area.in this particular spot i have seen multiple sightings on my way home from work at 3:45 am  i have seen 3 sightings this summer alone.;42.8233;-72.1826
