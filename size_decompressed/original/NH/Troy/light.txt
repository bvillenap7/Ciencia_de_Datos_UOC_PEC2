It was 15:50 hrs and still light outside,  I walked out onto my back porch and 200 yards from my house in the woods (192 yards of this is my open field) I saw 5 exceptionally bright white round lights in a horizontal line and 1 bright white round light up above to the right of the other lights.  The lights were not above the trees and they were not on the ground they were midway from the top and bottom of the trees.  There was absolutely no sound.  I ran in the house and got my binoculars and came back out and all I could see was lights that were it. Then the lights disappeared.  I got in my vehicle and drove up the road to see if I could see anything in the woods. I saw nothing.   The next day I took a walk up to the woods with my husband to see if there was anything on the ground.  There was no trace of anything on the ground.  There are two openings 28’ x 16’ in the trees in that area were something could have come in.;42.8233;-72.1826
