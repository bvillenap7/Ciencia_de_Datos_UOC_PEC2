About 24 dozen red to yellow spheres witnessed by 8;2012-08-18 17:30:00;10 minutes;About 24 dozen red to yellow spheres witnessed by 8 Epping, NH-Rt 87 heading towards Newfields.  Similar to the 8/6/12 report from Exeter.  About 2 dozen bright lights, red to yellow.  When we first noticed them they were very bright and fewer in number.   When we got to a location where we could pull over they were much further away and dimmer.  There was no noise and there was no pattern to their flight.  Faded away.   Another car stopped to ask us if we had seen it.  Police stopped and had not seen it.  Check out utube videoes for Glo-lanterns or Chinese lanterns.  This may be the most plausible explanation.;43.042;-71.0755
