Flying neon lights;1997-05-15 02:00:00;less than a minute;Flying neon lights Okay, first of all, I can't even remember exactly what year this took place (I have a terrible head for dates), so the date is likely way off, but that is my best guess. So is the time. I was at my parent's house - I was home from college for a week or so - using my mom's computer. This was back when I used chat rooms, so I was in one at the time. The way mom's desk is set up, when I was using the computer, I couldn't help but look out the window, so any movement would catch my attention. Being very dark though, that didn't happen until I saw these lights, that is. I don't remember the exact colors of these lights, but I do remember there was more than one color (I'm pretty sure red and blue were a couple of them). I immediately could say that this was a not plane for several reasons: 1. It was moving fairly slowly.  2. It was apparently flying bewteen the trees immediately behind the house and the forest at the bottom of the hill beyond those first trees - really low, no more than 100 feet from the ground at the bottom of the hill and roughly eye level with me on the second floor.  3. The aforementioned lights looked like neon bars - it appeared they ran along wings, but I could see no substance to this craft - only the lights. I exclaimed to the people in the chat room that I just saw a UFO, but that was really the end of it. It flew roughly NNE out of my sight. I'm not sure what it was. Ultralight, maybe? It's either that or something I'll never know about. Either way, it was obviously an object, it was flying, and I sure couldn't identify it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Driving down the road, saw a greenish light in the sky, slowed down to look at it,then it shot off into the sky;1998-02-10 21:00:00;45 sec.;Driving down the road, saw a greenish light in the sky, slowed down to look at it,then it shot off into the sky I was driving back from riding my horse in Londonderry N.H. at approx. 7:00 pm. I was traveling south torwards Salem N.H. along a dark, although fairly well populated road when I noticed how pretty the sky was that night. Suddenly I noticed an odd light in the sky. At first I just thought it was a plane from a nearby airport. The light however,  appeared to be about the size of 6 or 7 airplanes and I could not make out any shape except for the hazy green light. I slowed down, turned my lights off and drove to the side of the road to get a better look. As I pulled of, the object shot off towards what appeared to be away from earth. The car behind me also stopped and a man and a women, about the age of thirty came out and asked me if I had too, just seen what they had. They had actually been traveling on a different road and had seen the light and decided to follow it. According to them, the light had been there for about a minute, although I only saw it for approx. 45. sec before it vanished.;42.8674;-71.3793
While walking my dog, I saw 4 beams of light moving in and out and circling in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights??  PD));2007-10-23 20:55:00;1-2 minutes;While walking my dog, I saw 4 beams of light moving in and out and circling in the sky. On 10/23/07 at 8:55pm I took my dog out for a walk. I noticed what seemed to be a flash of light out of the corner of my eye so I turned and looked up. I saw 4 round/oval beams of light spread apart in a square formation in the sky.  They began to move in toward the center and out again several times. They then moved around in a circle. This went on for about 1-2 minutes then disappeared. Iâ€™ve never seen anything like this in my 55 years!  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights??  PD));42.8674;-71.3793

3 bright white/orange lights moving slowly observed over Londonderry, NH.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus?  PD));2013-11-02 19:00:00;10 minutes;3 bright white/orange lights moving slowly observed over Londonderry, NH At approximately 6:45-7:00pm, I was sitting next to a small firepit when I noticed an unusually bright light towards the South West direction that seemed to just hover over the trees.   I kept staring at the light for 2-3 minutes after which point, it started turning an orange hue and began to move.  It slowly kept moving in an Easterly direction.   After approx. 3-4 minutes, the light then faded away.  As I stared at the light, it appeared to pulsate slowly.  The light appeared to have a snowflake like shape.    A couple of minutes later, another light almost identical to the first one appeared and moved in the same manner as the first light.   Finally, I noticed a 3rd bright light at approx. 120 degrees that seemed to be more white in color.  That light appeared to move slowly in my direction and then faded away.   That light lasted about  1 minute.   I live within the flight path of the Boston/Manchester airport and am very used to seeing airplanes and I am quite confident that these were definitely not airplanes.  There was no sound at all.
