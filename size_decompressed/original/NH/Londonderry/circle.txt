an almost circular object, perched in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of a star, or perhaps Jupiter, we suspect.  PD));2009-08-16 01:30:00;still going;an almost circular object, perched in the sky Looking southeast from near Manchester airport, the circular craft is just sitting there.  I used binoculars and could draw it but can't describe it too well with words.  It had a couple of bright lights and then the rest was lit up with a criscross pattern.  It's now 03:05 and it has moved somewhat to the west.  It's at about a 30 degree angle upwards of where I'm standing. I am of sound mind and have never thought that I saw a UFO before tonight.  I watched it for about an hour. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));42.8674;-71.3793
Circular object, no sound, one bright white light with an orange glow, flickered and faded out quickly.;2012-09-01 22:00:00;1 minute;Circular object, no sound, one bright white light with an orange glow, flickered and faded out quickly. A solid white light with an orange glow was rising straight up.  It went northeast from north Windham to west Auburn, NH, in 40 seconds.  The light flickered and then faded out in 5 seconds the distance travelled in this fade-out was very long.  One minute in total duration, no sound, no strobe/safety lights. It had no tail like a meteor and kept rising up and northeast, away from the Manchester Airport.  Three witnesses observed this object in a clear night sky.  The aura of the object revealed a concave disc outline when at its lowest altitude in Windham.  I called the FAA and no private or commercial planes were in that area at 10pm.;42.8674;-71.3793
