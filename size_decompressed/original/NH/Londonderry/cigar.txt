Heading south on  Interstate Route 93,  my son and I noticed two cigar shaped craft, moving very slowly from the SW to the E  at about 8,000 feet high.  The craft had dull red lights on both ends with a strobing orange/white light in the middle. An additional third craft appeared behind the second craft forming a line of about three or four miles.  Each craft was separated by about a mile.    These craft were flying within three miles of the Manchester Air Port. We continued to drive south on Rote 93 and eventually lost sight of the craft.;42.8674;-71.3793
