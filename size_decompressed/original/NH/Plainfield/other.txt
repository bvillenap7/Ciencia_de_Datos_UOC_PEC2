Growing, star-like object expels glowing cloud and then collapses into cloud and is gone.;2009-09-19 19:51:00;1 minute;Growing, star-like object expels glowing cloud and then collapses into cloud and is gone. In the Southern sky, about 30 degrees up from the horizon was a star that rapidly got brighter and larger. No noise just a bright white light getting bigger. There are no clouds in the sky. The star appears to expel a gas-like, bluish, white cloud that falls downward. Maybe this is an explosion? The star remains in place and the cloud looks like it is starting to hang in a triangle shape (with the star at the apex). Bright light comes from the star and illuminates the triangle shaped cloud below. The star then appears to collapse into the glowing cloud. The star disappears into the cloud and is gone. The cloud glows brighterâ€¦bluish green. Slowly the cloud fades away. This whole process took about one and a half minutes. There was no sound other than a helicopter off to the right of this object. Three of us were feeding horses out in the field and the other person was checking on the steaks on the grill (and saw most of what we saw!) ((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch.  PD));43.5516;-72.2759
