Then witnessed more lights going north There were 4 people in our party traveling to our a home in conway nh. we were in 2 separte cars 2 in each car.We just paid at the last toll in rochester nh and were traveling north. I remember seeing the ten rod road sign(driving and all it all meshes together) but shortly after all these cars in front of me started braking for no apparent reason. I looked over to my left and noticed a craft hovering over a mountain and it had 10-12 lights and it was cigar shape it was like seeing the biggest jet hanging in the air and not moving. I was driving so I had to watch the road and couldn't concentrate on the object. I pointed to object to my brother driving in the car behind me. But later he said he nocticed me point but couldn't see anything but trees. He was in a car and I was in a suv. My brother and mother said there Radar detector(it was an old detector) was going crazy the whole way up and my brother made the comment maybe it was a ufo.But in my truck I had a newer detector and mine was fine. The object was an hr and 15 min from our destination. along the way I saw 2 planes traveling northeast but they had fcc blinking lights. But then just as i was about 30 min from my location I noticed this object with lights scatered about the object go across the sky and the lights dim as it went to the point you could see it anymore.this was on my left side of my vehicle object was traveling northeast. Also I saw what looked like this bright light hovering over an open space right around the vacinity of Indian mound golf course on my right and it had white lights but again I couldn't concentrate cause I was driving. This all happened within an 1hr and 15 min on rte 16 in nh. The passenger( my Mother) in the car traveling with us noticed the 2'nd phase of lights not the original sighting. My father who was driving with me noticed the lights but was more nervous about the road and said he would never travel with me again. Oh well how often to you see this much activity in the sky. I almost wish I could have pulled over and observe the whole time that way I could have made better head and tails with the whole thing. I know you need to eliminate any possible earthly explanations before you can say it was alien. But all I can say it got my attention and I hope someone will also put in a report cause there were a lot of cars on the road being ski season and all and being a friday night and all. Plus if the cars didn't brake I wouldn't have seen the 1st object in the 1st place. I'm just putting in a report and hope others do to;43.3013078947368;-70.9758394736842
Radically moving UFO.;2017-11-21 23:30:00;20 minutes;Radically moving UFO. It was a bright neon blue light that was zigzagging back and forth. when a plane flew near it, it started flashing with red. after about 20 minutes of watching it we looked away and five minutes later when we went to go and find it again, but it was gone.;43.3013078947368;-70.9758394736842
Saw a bright light possibly 2 close lights at what appears to be high altitude. Object continued to the S getting dimmer.;2017-11-26 16:16:00;7 minutes;Saw a bright light, possibly 2 close lights, at what appears to be high altitude.  Object continued to the south getting dimmer, and then disappears, and a tiny what appeared to be a small smoke trail.   Object then reappears as a light above treeline stayed stationary for a few minutes then proceeded in a Westerly direction as just a small cigar shaped object...  I don't think a plane would do this.  Could it be a drone???;43.3013078947368;-70.9758394736842
