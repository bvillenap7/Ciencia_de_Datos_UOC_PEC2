(Late 50s married couple walking dog after dinner) A reddish flaming object moving toward us in the night sky, appearing/feeling like a hot air balloon, but moving horizontally too fast. Might have been something above the flame, wavering. Seemed to be rising as it moved from South/SouthWest to North/NorthEast passing by us slightly to the West.  It faded into the distance, perhaps two minutes from coming into view until it disappeared to the North. Several minutes later as we approached other pedestrians(3 young men) we asked if they had seen it. &quotNo.&quot  Pointing up to where it had come from, we saw another on roughly the same path.  They all saw it.  In the next 5-10 minutes we all saw a pair traveling fairly close together, with one passing the other, and then three more individual &quotflames&quot on the same route. There was an aircraft passing roughly perpendicularly further South and much higher.;43.3013078947368;-70.9758394736842

Those 3 lights separated slowly away from each other and disappeared.  Behind those lights came several others in groups of 4 to 6 or so.  They all seemed to be 300 to 400 feet off of the ground and about 100 yards apart.  All flying in a row, one behind the other at about 30 to 50 mph? , running parallel to Rt 125 North.  A couple of the lights caught up to the lights ahead of them and flew beside them.   I drove south on Rt 125 and parked in front of Stewarts Green Houses were I could see more lights coming from the east, over the tree line across the street near Salmon Falls Road.  I watched the lights that kept coming in single file and flying along the side of Rt 125 North bound towards where they were first seen over Loan Oak Ice Cream.  I saw 35 to 40 or so total, in an 8 minute span between 5:00 pm and 5:08 pm.   When it looked like there were no more coming, I pulled out on to Rt 125 heading South, I looked over again toward the tree line and saw about 3 more appear, then I continued driving on my way home.;43.3013078947368;-70.9758394736842
