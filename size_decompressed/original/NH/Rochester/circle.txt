I stopped what I was doing and went outside where another employee was already out there and watching a reddish/orange what I thought was a star, possibly Venus. He informed me that there had been 2 of these objects but the other one had disappeared from view.  He also told me that they had been closer and larger in size and so were moving away. I continued watching and realized it couldn't be Venus as it appeared to be moving slowly and changing in brightness, from a dull orange to a brighter orange and then back to dull again. There were some clouds in the sky and it was getting dark but I noticed the clouds seemed to be very high in the sky and after about 5 minutes the orange object started to noticeably pick up speed and disappeared behind the clouds. We watched for a few more minutes but the object didn't return.  I went outside a few more times that evening but never saw the object again.;43.3013078947368;-70.9758394736842

I see lots of planes fly over my house at low and medium altitude which takes a minute or more. This thing was up there and cookin'.;43.3013078947368;-70.9758394736842
