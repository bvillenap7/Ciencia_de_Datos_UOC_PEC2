I was unloading groceries from rear trunk of the car to take in the house and I saw what appeared to be a shooting star. I was holding groceries and watched it falling, (the fall/arch was like unto the left top part of a circle to the middle part) but then it suddenly stopped and I saw lights of red, blue, green flickering. You could see it was at treeline. I estimate the distance I was away from what I saw to be three miles. I watched the lights flickering and it lowered slowly (stright down) and then lights out and I saw nothing more. I assumed that the next day there would be something in the paper or radio, but there was nothing and I have seen nothing like that since. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.
