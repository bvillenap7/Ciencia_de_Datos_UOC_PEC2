Strange orange lights in sky over Rochester, NH;2012-02-11 19:30:00;15 minutes;Strange orange lights in sky over Rochester NH My fiance had gone outside to smoke a cigarette and came back in quickly telling me to come outside right now!.  We both observed two orange lights moving across the sky from approximately West to East, keeping a perfect distance from each other.  As these entered a cloud bank three more of these lights came over the horizon.  Then a group of five came over the horizon in the exact shape and size of the big dipper.  These lights just kept coming and I did manage to take a video on my camera though the quality is not great.  The last object we say was hovering in the sky, un-moving for about ten seconds. In all honesty, at times we were not sure if some of the lights were separate or part of one large object...;43.3013078947368;-70.9758394736842

Many star like things wiggling in the sky at  12am till ???  I couldn't stay up to wait to watch them jet off or whatever.;2015-09-14 00:00:00;Hours;Many star like things wiggling in the sky at  12am till ???  I couldn't stay up to wait to watch them jet off or whatever. I've been gazing at the stars my whole life , I'm 33 , and never saw this before.  At 12am I saw many, what looked like typical stars but looked closer than usual which got my attention and as I watched I saw them slightly adjust their position in the sky.  I saw 1 single yellowish one to the east adjust up , down, left and right.   Then another 2 off far to the left one bigger than the other, moving the same way almost battling each other but never switching sides, almost like they were playing pong.   Then noticed to more sets on different parts of the sky, at least 12 set up in a triangular shape with smaller ones inside the formed shape, then 3 more in a straight line up and down very slowly moved  across the east to north.  Don't believe me, just stare at the sky tonight, you'll ((deleted)) be surprised.));43.3013078947368;-70.9758394736842
Yellow/Orange/White sphere seen by 3 in Rochester NH;2015-10-12 19:00:00;25 minutes;Yellow/Orange/White sphere seen by 3 in Rochester NH Last evening, 10/12/2015, I went out to my truck to get a bag of groceries when I noticed a bright, flashing light.  It was strobing, then it would stop and go very bright, then strobe again.  It was a white/yellow/orange combination of light. It was just sitting there in the North East just above the tree line.  I ran into our house and got my wife, she came out to the front of our home, watched it with me for about 30 seconds, then it moved to the North. We could no longer see it from the front of our house so we went out to our back deck and was able to see it just over the trees. It was very, very bright, moving funny.  A little to the left, then up, then back.  After about 2 to 3 minutes, right before our eyes, it vanished!  At this time our daughter came over and wanted to know what we were doing, we told her what we saw.  After about 5 minutes of scanning the sky, BAM, it repapered right where it had vanished.  It seemed much brighter, moving a bit erratic and strobing faster.  After about 2 to 3 minutes, it moved up and to the north, then in a second vanished again.  We watched for another 10 to 15 minutes but it never came back. What we did notice is that after about 20 minutes after in vanished for the last time, there were a number of airplanes!!  We did not see one in the sky while we were watching the “UFO”, but after we counted at least 8 in the sky over and around where we saw the light.  Our son is very much into UFO’s and told us that when something like this happens and you see a number of planes, something defiantly is going on.  We are going to continue to monitor the sky every night for a while to see if it comes back.;43.3013078947368;-70.9758394736842
Bright lit object over head watched it fade and disappear.;2016-07-10 22:00:00;1 minute;Bright lit object over head watched it fade and disappear. Out star gazing with the family in the back yard.  Bight light comes over our tree line, bright white like a plane, but no blinking lights or noise would hear with a plane that low.  Watched as it flew over us and slowly the light started to fade on it.   Just when it got right over us it disappeared completely, and we all saw it happen.;43.3013078947368;-70.9758394736842
Two very bright vertically oriented lights observed during the day, while traveling southbound on Rt 125.;2017-10-17 17:10:00;15 seconds;Two very bright vertically oriented lights observed during the day, while traveling southbound on Rt 125. While traveling southbound on Rt 125 in Rochester, I observed 2 very bright white lights oriented vertically in the sky (one above the other).  The light on top was stationary.  The lower light was observed at about 1/2 the distance from the top light to the ground, moving right to left.   They appeared to be positioned in the direction of Barrington or Madbury, but distance was difficult to ascertain.  No contrails or aircraft outlines were observed.   After viewing the lights for about 15-20 seconds, both vanished simultaneously and did not reappear.;43.3013078947368;-70.9758394736842
