Brillant white lighted object dotting across the sky then circling area, leaving then once again returnng and circling small area;2004-07-18 02:47:00;13 minutes;Brillant white lighted object dotting across the sky then circling area, leaving then once again returnng and circling small area We had a group of 11 people on a camping trip.The camp grounds (Country Bumpkins sites 7&8)are located in Lincoln N.H.,Everyone but two of us had turned in for the evening on Saturday July 17,2004. At aproximately 2:47am while waiting for our camp fire to die down an object which was brilliant white light no strobes or sound could be seen or heard, Flew from a southernly direction over to our right and ahead of us to the north over some trees where it then proceeded to circle the area. The object could be seen as it passed behind the trees. It then dotted to the right along the trees Rising just above the tree line and then back to the south where it turned and then headed east and out of view. It then came back into view from the east and again ahead of us just over some trees. We could see the object kind of circling behind the trees before it dissapeared. Note: when the object was flying it looked as if it were skipping like a light being turned on then off then back on again made it look like dots being drawn in the sky. earlier in the evening it was overcast but the sky was clear at this point during the sighting. I did grab my video camera but so far I can't really see anything on it but static and our own voices.It looked saucer shaped but with a small flat section around what seemed like the back of it.;44.0619;-71.6733
