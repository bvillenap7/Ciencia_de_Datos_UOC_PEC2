RED,BLUE-GREEN AND YELLOW-WHITE LIGHTS SITTING STILL IN SKY.;2001-09-22 21:15:00;45 MIN;RED,BLUE-GREEN AND YELLOW-WHITE LIGHTS SITTING STILL IN SKY. WE WERE CAMPING AT RUSSEL POND WHEN WE SAW SOME LIGHTS OVER THE NORTH-WEST SKY. WE THOUGHT IT WAS A PLANE AT FIRST BUT IT DIDN'T MOVE FOR A LONG TIME. THE ONLY MOVEMENT WE SAW WAS UP AND DOWN A LITTLE. WE THE IT MUST BE A CHOPPER BUT COULDN'T HEAR IT BECAUSE A NEAR BY RACEWAY WAS MAKING TO MUCH NOISE. ABOUT 21:45 THE RACES ENDED AND WE STILL COULDN'T HEAR ANY SOUND FROM THE OBJECT. AT THAT TIME THE MOVED VERY QUICKLY TO THE RIGHT AND BACK. THIS HAPPENED TWICE.WE LOOKED THOUGH BINOCULARS AT THE LIGHT AND SAW RED,BLUE-GREEN AND YELLOW-WHITE LIHGTS. ABOUT 23:00 IT EITHER WENT DOWN OR FLEW AWAY FROM US AND DISAPEARED.;44.0619;-71.6733

To the naked eye it appeared much brighter than any of the surrounding stars and perhaps consisting of two or more close lights. It appeared to flash or twinkle but this may have been due to atmospheric conditions. At times it would move slowly east of south pausing occasionally. I took a photograph with my cell phone which appeared to show a bright dog bone shaped object. I also took a video with my cellphone, which when viewed later at home on a 25 monitor, showed two close but distinct objects each of which seemed to eject a smaller object. After a half hour or so we went to bed. When I awoke at approximately 4AM the same objects were in the sky but in the northeast of our position.;44.0619;-71.6733
