It was approximately 15 or 20 degrees above the horizon.  The impression was that it was a relatively large object  The sky was clear.  The weather was good with a few minor clouds. The lights appeared for a few seconds, and flashed much brighter for a few seconds  and then quickly faded out.  The lights were a warm, orange color.  I have no idea what this could possibly have been, but it certainly was not a phenomena of nature.  It was clearly mechanical / manufactured in its appearance.;22.2089;-159.3987
