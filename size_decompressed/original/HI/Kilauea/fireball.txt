At approx. 4:30 a.m. I was in my vehicle and had just entered the roadway, traveling in a northerly direction, when instantaneously the sky all around me lit up, from stars and blackness to BLUE.  I knew the light source was coming from behind me and turned in my seat to see a huge, blue fireball, with yellow orange tail, falling from the sky at an angle of approximately 35 degrees.  Guessing at it's size and proximity, I felt that the object appeared to be headed toward land and I presume it did touch down on Kauai.  Entire duration of this event was approximately 5 seconds.;22.2089;-159.3987

It was as though lightening had struck.  I immediately opened my eyes to see what appeared to be a shooting star, but it was close to the earth, very close and had a tail of lightening.  It was decending onto property probably 500 feet south of my house.  In a few seconds, the light was extinguished.  I had never seen anything like this, especially the portion of lightening attached to this firery missle.  I was very alarmed, got up and noticed it was 4:30 A.M.  Later in the day, other people on the Hawaiian island of Kauai reported seeing this sight 40 miles south in Kalaheo.  I believe I witnessed a meteorite with a tail of bluish electricity.;22.2089;-159.3987
