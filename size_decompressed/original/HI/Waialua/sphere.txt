We were kind of in the country and traffic was low.  We thought it was strange because we had no idea what it was, and we had never seen anything that bright before.  We found a run-down dirt road off of the pavement to get a closer look.  The orbs were about 10-15 feet in diameter and were amazingly bright.  We have no idea what they were or why they were there.  We did not have a camera with, nor did we go any closer because they were over private property with No Trespassing signs posted everywhere.   Maybe it is something for an upcoming 4th of July ceremony, but it was too weird to be normal... I think.;21.5757;-158.1229
