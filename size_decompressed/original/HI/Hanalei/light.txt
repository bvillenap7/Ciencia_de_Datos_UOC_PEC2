We saw six orange lights appear over Hanalei Bay, Kauaii;2008-08-28 21:00:00;1:30;We saw six orange lights appear over Hanalei Bay, Kauaii My partner and I were walking on the beach at about 9:00 pm on August 28, 2008 at the Hanalei Colony Resort, on Kauai’s north shore looking across Hanalei bay towards the Princeville resort when an orange light appeared in the sky.  It glowed orange with a slight flicker.  Then it went out and another one appeared to the left of it. Then another one appeared so there were two.  Both of them went out and one more appeared to the left of those. That one went out and another one appeared. Each of them only lasted maybe five to seven seconds before going out.  Then after a pause of about a minute another appeared MUCH closer to us (westward).  It was really bright orange and it was in the shape of a square. It lasted a few seconds and went out.  We watched for an hour but didn’t see anything more.  There some small clouds in the sky but no moon. We could see the airport search light and lighthouse but it wasn’t either of them and it was in the sky over the water.;22.1603;-159.5471
