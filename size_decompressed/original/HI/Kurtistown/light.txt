As it decended through the moonlight clouds it fascinated me with it's speed color and beauty.I couldn't take my eyes off of it! I jumped up from the couch and flew through the back door to see if it was going to hit the ground, and that's when it stopped above the neighbor's tree line hovered a moment, then went to the left above the treeline of my neighbors...Completely silent. It was the most beautiful display I have ever seen.;19.5654;-155.0339
