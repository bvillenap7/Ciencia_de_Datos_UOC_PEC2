Sighting of object during meteor shower  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of twinkling star?  PD));2001-11-18 02:00:00;2 hours;Sighting of object during meteor shower Approx. Dec. 1st 2001 a heavily advertised meteor shower was to happen with its greatest show at approx. 02:00am from the east.  I stayed up for event and it was indeed a spectacle.  As I viewed the show I noticed to the NorthEast a stationary extremely bright star or planet.  It was so bright that I wondered what planet it could be this time or year.  I braced myself against the corner of my house and took a picture of it with my digital camera with a telephoto lens at the maximum.  When I viewed the image it didn't really present change from the way I viewed it with the naked eye.  So, I decided to download to my computer and then digitally magnify it.  As I magnified it started taking on a shape up 200X before it became distorted.  It definitely was metallic and was saucer shape.  It appears that a light is on top but may be a reflection of the sun.  I thought maybe this could be a satellite but it remained stationary and didn't move for approx. 2 hours.  I, like most people didn't report it because of the possible stigmas attached to the person reporting such things.  I feel though that it is an important picture for those concerned. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Witness may be alluding to the dramatic Leonid Meteor shower, which peaked on Sunday, November 18, 2001.  For details, see here:   http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast15nov_1.htm?list49634 We have altered the date to November 18, 2001. PD));20.8815326797387;-156.478248529413

it beamed a light upwards. For about 15 minutes everyone was trying to take a picture and no ones camera worked. Some people thought it;2010-12-19 20:18:00;20 minutes;It was above my neighbors house just hovering about 100 ft up.It was a round disc that was about 25 ft wide that had all different color lights around it, but what was funny is that it beamed a light upwards. For about 15 minutes everyone was trying to take a picture and no ones camera worked. Some people thought it was the end of the world and started praying. All of a sudden it zoomed away at an incredible speed. Before it zoomed away the clouds swirled around the UFO in dis weird way. That part freaked me out. Whats weird also it did not make any noise We were the ones making noise. This was in Kahului on One St. About 50 or more people saw this. I think people are not talking about it because they no like look crazy.  My whole neighborhood couldn't have been tripping out ...we all saw da same thing!!!;20.8815326797387;-156.478248529413
