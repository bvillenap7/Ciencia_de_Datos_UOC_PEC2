6 arclight orbs that seemed to be under intelligent control fly-by @ 5000ft.;2010-11-13 21:00:00;5-6 min;6 arclight orbs that seemed to be under intelligent control fly-by @ 5000 ft. six very bright lime green orbs similar to a tig arc very steady unlike a regular fluctuating arc welding light . these spherical objects in echelon formation moved southbound aprox 5,500 ft asl. first saw them over the west maui mountains (5.400 peak) estimate speed aprox. 800mph+..at mid valley 2 of them initiated a right 90 degree heading 270 turn towards kahoolawe island and eventually vanished.. the other 4 continued straight ahead due south over the western slope of mt. Haleakala maintaining altitude towards the big island until out of sight. they left a short faint trail of same color light, just a whisp. they made no sound , very steady flight paths, called maui tower and police but they said nothing on radar or police reports. their lights were very bright like I said like tig arc lights I was surprised that the papers or news didn't carry the story? it was truly a light show.. no one has their cell phone or cameras with them. would have taken me to long to get my camera so we just enjoyed the sight. they were not piston or jet aircraft no sound (neighborhood was very quiet)  and to slow for gliders. I used the known mountain heights for reference and for speed estimate. this was not the first time we've ween them.  heard you on coast to coast tonite hence this report. I have been a pilot since 1977 and always have been a aircraft enthusiast since my childhood. this is why  my speed and altitude estimates are very close. I refrained from reporting to FAA. my mother in-law who is a Jehovah witness had nothing to say.  I'm a Buddhist.  we were not drinking alcohol. wondering if you've had similar reports from maui like mine???  I now wonder if there is a god?  Aloha;20.8815326797387;-156.478248529413
