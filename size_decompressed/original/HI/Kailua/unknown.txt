On a beach stroll at night with my significant other. Her and I noticed a star like circular dot way up high, no different than any other lit star or planet in the night sky. However, the the dot of light began to move at a rapid pace. It had the ability to go the full distance of the sky in mere seconds. This was no shooting star for it did not quickly vanish nor was it a low altitude airplane like craft. We could barely make out the shape before it cut short immediately, lowered slowly at a 90 degree rate and disappeared behind some clouds. I went back out each night hoping to see something similar. And on 5/12 I saw a star making similar movements but this time it was much closer to the ground. It was changing direction and getting closer almost as if it noticed me. My neck began to hurt from stargazing so I had to give up and go back inside. But as I kept looking back over my shoulder on my way back, the light became brighter and it felt as i! f it almost was following me home.;21.4082;-157.7396
