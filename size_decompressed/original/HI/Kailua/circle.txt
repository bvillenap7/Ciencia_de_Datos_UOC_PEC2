I said &quotwhat the h I was watching tv with my husband and saw a circular item in the sky fly very low and very fast past our house.  I said what the hell was that.  And ran outside (6 steps) it had disappeared.   At the same time my son, who is 11 was on the computer on the other side of the house.  He ran out and said   I just saw a UFO he was certain, and made a sketch.  He did not hear me, and was relieved I saw it too.   At the same time, all the dogs in the neighborhood started barking.  It was really weird.  Clearly not a plane and too big and fast to be a drone.  Also, it flew really quite low.   I have never spotted any UFOs before today.;21.4082;-157.7396
