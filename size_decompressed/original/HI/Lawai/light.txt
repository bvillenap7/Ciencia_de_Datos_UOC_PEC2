A bright light/flash with an explosion.;2000-12-01 04:35:00;5 seconds;A bright light/flash with an explosion. I was just getting out of bed at 4:35 a.m. and I saw a very bright light/flash which lasted about 2-3 seconds.  The light/flash was bright enough to light up the area around it.  Followed by the light/flash there was a sound like an explosion.  My house rattled and windows shook.  One of our two dogs barked as the light/flash came until the explosion sounded.  The way the dog barked was unusual, like he was suddenly frightened. The entire event lasted about 5 seconds.;21.9352;-159.4994
