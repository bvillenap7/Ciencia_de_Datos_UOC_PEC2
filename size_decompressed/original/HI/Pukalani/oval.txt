Bright orange glowing oval shaped object moving in the sky;2020-01-21 21:15:00;2 minutes;Bright orange glowing oval shaped object moving in the sky While unloading my car at approximately 9:15 pm on Tuesday, January 21, as I was walking down my driveway back to my car, I noticed a bright orange oval light tilted sideways in the sky, directly across the street from me, over neighbors home.  I watched it slowly move left while glowing for about 20 seconds then ran into my house for my phone camera which took less than 30 seconds.  By then I could only see a tiny orange light far off in the distance then disappeared. I couldn't imagine what it could be.  My first guess was UFO but researched to see if it was some type of drone but could not find anything with that description.  Although I found information on other glowing orange UFOs similar to what I saw that were seen in other parts of the world.  I viewed photos online and videos on YOUTUBE. https://youtu.be/yOU1ju1ViLo  This video is an example of what I saw except it was tilted and just glowing different shades of orange.  I did not see any other lights on i! t.;20.8585;-156.328
