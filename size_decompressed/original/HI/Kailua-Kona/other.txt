Floating man over Kailua-Kona,HI;2011-06-04 09:00:00;5 minutes;Floating man over Kailua-Kona,HI To whom it may concern,: On the above date and time my wife and I plus our 3 children sighted a man floating in the air wearing a black avator suit.  My 2yr old son stated 'a balloon a balloon !'  The rest of us looked and saw a thin man wearing a black suit.  He appeared to be floating in the air.  He was stationary.  There were no wires attached to him nor was he wearing any wings.  Several Auto dealerships were contacted but not one of them fly balloons because of the nearby wires.  Our newspaper (West Hawaii Today) was contacted to see if anyobe else had seen the 'thin man'.  No response.;19.652946816976;-155.979964323608
