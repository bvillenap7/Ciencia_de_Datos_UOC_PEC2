possible anamolous object on TV show;2003-03-17 13:00:00;2-3 seconds;possible anamolous object on TV show I recently had an incredible sighting while on vaction that I did not report and I am not reporting here. Since that time I have been even more vigilant and today I think I saw something that may be worthy of a quick investigation. I was watching The National Geographic Channel, Expedition Journal: In the cold light of day. Towards the end of the program, (I was flipping through the channels and did not watch the whole thing) a photograper who was being profiled on the show was charged by a musk ox he was photographing near the seaside. In the next scene as the narrator speaks about photographing subjects under all conditions, 2 men are shown walking down a country road. Something is moving in the sky very discreetly. It happened very quickly and I didn't tape it, so for all I know it may be an airplane or bird or cloud. But my gut tells me it may be a good UFO shot. Please let me know if I can help in any other way. As for my previous sighting, I'm not sure I want to type it all out yet. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witness observed in the program.  We have encouraged him to submit his other sighting.  PD));19.652946816976;-155.979964323608
