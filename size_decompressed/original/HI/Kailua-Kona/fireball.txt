bright fire ball cfrossing the sky blueish/green with a tail.;2001-01-20 19:15:00;5 seconds;bright fire ball cfrossing the sky blueish/green with a tail. we were driving on the road when it came from atop the mountain down to the ocean in an east to west manner.  it was so close to the earth brighter thatn anything i have ever seen.  it was blueish/green and had a long tail.  I though it must have landed on the ground, but my friend thought it was heading towars the ocean.  Maybe it was a meterorite or comet or something. It was very weird.  I do spend quite a bit of time looking at the sky, and consider myself familiar with most of the regular things in the sky...;19.652946816976;-155.979964323608
