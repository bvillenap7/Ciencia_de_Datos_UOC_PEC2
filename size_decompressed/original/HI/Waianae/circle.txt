It suddenly stopped near the tree line in our back yard and then started pulsating.  I watched it for about 5 minutes.  The object then looked like it was about to move forward, in the direction of our house when it suddenly went into reverse.  I immediately got up to get my roommate to witness this strange light in the sky but when she got there, the object was gone.;21.4337;-158.1767
