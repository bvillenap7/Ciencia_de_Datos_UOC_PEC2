Strange lights in Makaha skies.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable launch of an Aegis anti-missile rocket at 19:35 hrs..  PD));2014-05-20 19:30:00;unknown;Strange lights in Makaha skies. There was this strange light zig-zagging in the sky for a long time, kind of like a snake.  It left a twisted, long, orange trail behind it.   I don't know if it was one craft or more than one, but it moved rapidly about.  I do know that lots of people saw it and were able to get pictures.
