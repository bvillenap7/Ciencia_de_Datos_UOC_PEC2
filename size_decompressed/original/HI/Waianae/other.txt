Strange object in sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus, or a star??  PD)) ((anonymous report));2017-10-09 04:30:00;5 minutes;Strange object in sky. As I was leaving the house, I noticed something very bright in the sky.  It was so bright, it couldn't be ignored.  I looked up and seen a eye shaped (with ends) one pointed upward and one pointed downward.  The sky was pitch black, a few clouds around but not in the area of the object.  The object was a greyish/purple color, couldn't be a could as the clouds were way darker in color.  In the middle of the object was a single bright light, never flashed but remained constant.  It moved in a sidewards motion very slowly.  I noticed as it moved, it started slowing disappearing.  It took a quick second until I noticed it was gone by the Hakimo side mountain.
