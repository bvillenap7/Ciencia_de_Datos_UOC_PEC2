5-10 foot gray sphere at 500 feet moving E-W without sound at 200mph...?  Unusual Drone!  ((anonymous source));2019-05-30 20:00:00;10 seconds;5-10 foot gray sphere at 500 feet moving East West without sound at 200mph...?  Unusual &quotDrone&quot! This sighting is from the leeward coast on a clear beautiful evening where stars are easily seen and I am familiar with the night sky, know constellations, stars, planet locations ,etc. use astronomical telescopes, frequently see satellites passing over and local commercial and military aircraft are common here on Oahu.  I was looking North East in the direction of Ursa Major handle pointing to Spica in Auriga when I saw a satellite passing Northeast.  It or something else nearby winked a bright light and went out, just one flash.  This was at satellite distance.  I did not see the satellite again.  Seconds after a gray 5-10 foot sphere much closer maybe 500 feet above moved right over my property towards ocean West in direction of Kauai over the ocean.  It was absolutely silent and was not a normal drone with wings, propellers.  It was not hovering but moving in a straight line and in 2-3 seconds was gone.  Its path was geometric and resolute as if moving on line of force not being driven by an airfoil. Unusual.  Most military operations and civilian aircraft are offshore and helicopters that pass overhead are noisy of course.  This object was not a bird like a frigate which soar over the area sometimes.  Satellites as they move overhead often change their light because they are rotating in the light of the sun.  I have many times seen them wink a bright light, whether this is due to the sun or is intentional light semaphore being used is equivocal.  The sphere may have been coincidental and was an unusual drone.  Worth reporting to your database .;21.4337;-158.1767
Gray sphere maybe 10 feet in diameter(tough to gauge) as I'm not sure of the altitude absolutely no sound.((anonymous source));2019-05-30 20:00:00;10 seconds;Gray sphere maybe 10 feet in diameter(tough to gauge) as I'm not sure of the altitude absolutely no sound. Dusk, almost dark, about an hour after sunset I was looking up in the vicinity of Spica as I often do at this time of night to see if any satellites are going over...  I saw a bright flash of light and at first I thought it must be a satellite rotating thus making a flash by reflection of the sun but there was no repletion of the flash of light.   Then a sphere at a much closer altitude maybe 500 feet passed quickly East to West right over my head (it was not a bird!)  It was gray and travelled quickly in a straight line East to West out of sight in 5 seconds.  There was no sound whatsoever. It might be an advanced drone of some kind.  The odd thing is the bright light flashing before I saw it like seeing Spica but the it wasn't Spica which was further to my left in the sky.  Then this sphere floats right past East to West but moving quickly.  Possibly military drone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
