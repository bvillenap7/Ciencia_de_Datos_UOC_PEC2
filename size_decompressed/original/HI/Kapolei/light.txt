LED like lights swarming above ocean in west Oahu.;2010-01-08 21:35:00;40 secs;LED like lights swarming above ocean in west Oahu. Two Lights spotted over SW Oahu towards ocean.  One bright blue and one bright green LED colored light in the shape of a dot.  Both lights had a faint stream of related light flashing off the sides in a “A” frame angle from the base light. Both lights were swarming in different directions and in a rapid motion that no aircraft can produce within one another’s zone for about 30 seconds or so.  At one time the blue light shot upwards into a low cloud then back down towards the green light. The lights faded into the horizon. I stared a good 20 seconds at the lights and couldn’t make out what they could be. ran back inside the house for my video camera but was not able to get a focus in time before they faded.;21.3454000000001;-158.084199999999

The Blue and Green lights were like someone pointing a bright flashlight at you from a distance.  The color and intensity resembled laser light.  It was neither incandescent nor florescent but very bright light like a high intensity LED.  The lights both gave out two small sharp rays of light from the orb’s body at a 45 degree angle towards the ground.  The trail of light  were small but visible. I thought it was someone pointing a laser light into the air but it was very bright and showed no trail from the laser’s origin. I stared at the two lights for about 30 seconds in shock trying to make out what it could be, initially I thought it was a hovering helicopter or a UAV but they moved way to fast and in different directions for it to be any aircraft I have ever seen.  At one time the blue orb shot straight upwards into a low cloud and then regrouped with the green orb. I got my video camera but couldn’t get a focus on the objects in time before they disappeared into the horizon. Both orbs are assumed to be at a estimated 5 to 10 thousand feet or more off my line of sight above the horizon.  My estimated of its location is off shore of the Chevron Oil processing plant in West Oahu, about 3 miles north of the Barbers Point Light House. I can not tell if it was over land or not but seemed to be just off shore.  It was impossible to get a scale size of the objects but that they seemed close to land. I called my friend who works at the ATC tower in Honolulu Airport but he called back and stated no reports from the tower.  I also contact a friend on the west side of the island but stated that he saw nothing.  The news had no reports as well. I am sure someone else saw it too.  It is possible for someone that was driving West on H1 Freeway towards Makakilo, HI at about 2130 - 2135 hrs. I hesitated to report this but there is no denying what I saw.;21.3454000000001;-158.084199999999

Bright green light drops from middle of sky and disappears in seconds.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor??  PD));2014-08-31 03:20:00;3 seconds;Bright green light drops from middle of sky and disappears in seconds. On Sunday August 31st, at approximately 3:20 AM, I was driving home with my friend from a night out. We had just passed Waikele, when we saw a large green light drop from the middle of the sky.  It happened really fast.   It dropped and sort of disappeared real quick and then a second or so later, it dropped again a little lower from where it had just disappeared and then it kind of got bright and disappeared real quick again.   I don't even know how it disappeared because it literally happened so fast.   I've seen shooting stars, comets, and meteors before, but nothing like this.  It really have me chills.

Two bright lights at altitude over Kapolei;2019-11-24 19:30:00;0:45;Two bright lights at altitude over Kapolei Bicycling in Mililani shortly after sundown. Saw two bright lights over Kapolei.  One was much brighter than the other.  They were both horizontal over the horizon, at about 6,000 feet if judged in comparison with the Waianae Mountains.  Too bright to be a star or planet. Didn't move like a plane.;21.3454000000001;-158.084199999999
