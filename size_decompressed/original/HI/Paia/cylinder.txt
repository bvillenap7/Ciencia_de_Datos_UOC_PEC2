cylinder shaped red glowing craft moving very fast from the north to the west;1999-04-25 23:30:00;5-10 minutes;cylinder shaped red glowing craft moving very fast from the north to the west going into the house I looked up and saw a cylinder shaped craft moving fast from the north heading west I called my son and his friend and they ran to the top of the road to watch it longer and saw it moving very fast to Iao Valley and out of sight. I have seen many moving stars and a glowing blue light landing as well as a fleet of lights fly over a party and dissapear one 4th of July years past (most of the island saw that) but never a totally red glowing craft before and never the cylinder shape.;20.918;-156.3818
