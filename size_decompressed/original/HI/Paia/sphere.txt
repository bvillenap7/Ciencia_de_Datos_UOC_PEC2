It didn't move at all.  I blinked my eyes to clear my head but it was still there.  It wasn't the moon cause the moon doesn't disappear and there wasn't a lot of ambient light except for what was right around it.  It had hard edges but they were somewhat obscured by the light radiating outwards.  I really had to go cause I couldn't wait any longer  and when I came back it was gone.;20.918;-156.3818
