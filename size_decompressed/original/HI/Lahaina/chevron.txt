Maui, August 1993, incredibly fast & quiet lighted craft moves across the sky, news reports confirm sighting with no explanation.;1993-08-04 20:30:00;3-4 sec;Maui, August 1993, incredibly fast & quiet lighted craft moves across the sky, news reports confirm sighting with no explanation. My wife and I were walking near the ocean when we noticed a lighted object appear on the horizon, move very quickly overhead and disappear on the opposite horizon.  If it was a large object far away, then it was moving unbelievably fast.  On the other hand, if it was smaller and closer, then it was unbelievably quiet.   A man and a woman were walking near us on the path and we all asked each other if we had really seen what we thought we had.  We confirmed the details mentioned above and discussed their implications based on the laws of physics.    The other man was the ((deleted)) coach of ((deleted)).  I hold a degree from the University of Michigan with a major in ((deleted)) science.  We're not crazy, and we knew that what we had just seen was not normal.   The next two days the sighting was reported in the local newspaper with no explanation.  Perhaps it was a satellite which had fallen from its orbit and was about to crash into the ocean, but I don't think so because it had pale green-yellow lights.  A small private jet?  No, it was too fast and too quiet.   Have you heard other reports of this incident? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));20.9174000000001;-156.677199999999
