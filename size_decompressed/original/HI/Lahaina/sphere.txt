Towards the end of its flight path, a orange/red flame shot out from the back not extending out far from the object. I was rehearsing with my band in an out door ampitheater. The sky was in full view with no clouds. As I was singing I looked up and saw a very bright sphere like object moving very fast across the sky from West to East. Before the object disapeared, it shot out a bright orange/red flame from the back of its flight line. The flame did not extend that far from the object. The object was in view for around 5 seconds, then just disapeared. My guitar player also saw this event. When I told our manager, he said it most likely was the rocket boosters from the space shuttle reentering the earths atmosphere. The only problem with this is that the shuttle lifted off 10 hours earlier.;20.9174000000001;-156.677199999999

Quiet, fast moving, heading northwest. If the moon is a basketball, this would be a tennis ball in size. I saw it over the roof af the neighboring building, traveling faster than any plane, silently. It was very bright, with a mix of red, green and regular bright white light. I have never seen anything like this, and it is embedded in my memory.  I was born and raised in Seattle, raised a family, and ten years ago moved to Maui, where I habe worked for the historic organization here, doing research. I have excellent eyesight! This sphere was so large and so bright, that I cannot believe that no one else saw it. Many people are outside on Maui evenings, I will watch the newspapers for reports from others.;20.9174000000001;-156.677199999999
