In front of me traveling north to south were 5 bright balls moving verryy fast andeqally spaced with no comet trail. I was stunned and amazed. The first thing i did was to ask th couple at the pool if they also saw this. They did and the three of us had a conversation . I let them stay in the pool...... I have never fogotton that night.

My neighbor and his wife had thought it to be a planet for several minutes until i came outside and told them that it did not seem like anything of this world. as if it heard me it started to move sideways then backward and up to space it went at break-neck speeds until it vanished.
