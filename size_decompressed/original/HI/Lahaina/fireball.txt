5 fireballs fly low over Lahaina in tight formation;1994-06-01 02:30:00;<1 minute;5 fireballs fly low over lahaina in tight formation 5 fireballs shot across the sky right over Lahaina.  Very low to the ground, I was over by the Hard Rock Cafe and saw what almost looked like fireworks but they flew parallel to the ground, as if they were planes flying in tight formation, and were fast, but steady, too slow to be any kind of firework.   And fireworks go up, not straight across without any deviation in altitude.   This was completely unexplained and all I could think of was alien aircraft of some sort. These were no planes, but were clearly moving at an unnatural speed, yet steady and  precise.  They also didn't deviate at all in their formation, as if they were expert pilots or locked-in automatically.  It blew my mind but I didn't know what to make of it.  I hoped to see it in the paper the next day, but didn't.  Others were with me who saw it, and it looks like another report of the same event was made by a security guard over by Puamana.;20.9174000000001;-156.677199999999
Orange orb over Lahaina on July 4th;2012-07-04 19:45:00;1 minute;Orange orb over Lahaina on July 4th Waiting for the fireworks display to start at the Lahaina harbor, my kids and I saw a bright orange orb hovering overhead.  At first I thought it might be a flare, the sky was still bright as the sun was just setting.   The orb stayed stationary for about a minute then disappeared behind a cloud.  It was obviously not a flare as its altitude was far above the cloud.   My three daughters and wife all saw it.

Two seperate events of orange and white fireballs, lacking tails, travel across northern skies of Kaanapali to the South.;2013-08-18 21:40:00;2 minutes;Two seperate events of orange and white fireballs, lacking tails, travel across northern skies of Kaanapali to the South. Viewed single, orange/white fireball with no tail.  Initially viewed from the Northern sky, traveling silently in a straight line.  Speed was much slower than a comet and appeared to slow while still traveling in a straight line.  It appeared to deviate a bit from its flight path while still maintaining a constant firey glow. The fireball appeared to travel over the Maui Channel then headed South past Lanai Isl. The size reduced as it travelled away and eventually disappearing. The event lasted approximately 45 seconds. Approximately 30 seconds to 90 seconds a second fireball appeared. Point of view was the same as the first and the shape was the same size and luminosity.  The direction of travel was the same.  The decreased speed and deviation from the flight path was not identical to the first event.  The duration of  second fireball was approximately 40 - 45 seconds.;20.9174000000001;-156.677199999999
