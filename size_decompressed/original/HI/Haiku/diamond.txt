While walking my dog at sunset though the pinapple fields at ocean side Haiku, Maui I spotted a small black disk/diamond shaped black spot in the sky at cloudlinelevel over the ocean approximately 100-200 yards out.  I watched it for 5 minutes and realized that it was not moving in any direction.  This sparked my curiousity.   There are always plenty of airplanes coming and going from Maui but this was not one.  I continued from the pinnaple fields toward the ocean and consitantly towards the hovering black diamond disk.  The black object moved minimally from side to side up and down and front and back. The object remained hovering at cloud level while I watched it.  From the cliffside I noticed that the object did have some sort of faint exhaust streaming at some length behind it with the direction of the east wind.  The object went in and out of the clouds with no problem but tended to remain out of the clouds for the majority of the time.  Some 45 minutes later (as it was getting dark) I decided to walk back to my truck (for camera phone)and drive back to the site to see if anyone else had witnessed this.  When I arrived back at the site  the object was gone.   It was just turning dark and some stars were peeking through the twilight.  There were some locals fishing down the cliffside on the coast... but it was getting dark and I was not going to take my chances on the steep cliff hike nor with any unknown locals at night.;20.9071;-156.3
