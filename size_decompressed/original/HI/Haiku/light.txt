It appeared to be a planet like Venus. I looked in the westbound direction, probably heading 270 from my vantage point from the east looking directly west. It was above the West Maui Mountains. It was clear night. The star or light, was very bright and getting brighter in intensity. It was then moving slowly, from left to right. and then it would stop. and then it would move again, right to left. And then, it would dim, until it was completely out of sight. It was at least at a 60 degree angle slant range from my point of view. It was very high above the mountains, not near any horizon or clouds or sea level horizon. It was at a 60 degree angle. and then it would reappear, and it would become a bright light again. This pattern would continue for about 10-15 minutes. I don't think it was any clouds or atmosphere, because I the visibility was clear, light winds, no clouds, and clear night skies. You could see other stars blinking continuously, and you could see the Hawaii night sky. I cannot say that it was in fact an flying saucer, or UFO, but I do not believe it was a planet nor a star. A planet does not move, from side to side, a star blinks, it does not dim for 1 minute and then turn bright for the next minute. and then after this pattern repeatedly, it completely disappeared, and the light never reappeared. If it was Venus, it would have come back into view, I continued to watch the night sky for another whole hour. Same direction, same area, and the light never reappeared.;20.9071;-156.3
Formation of three amber in color until 90 degree turn then red in color and very high speed to horizon.;2014-02-08 08:12:00;30 seconds;Formation of three amber in color until 90 degree turn then red in color and very high speed to horizon The six craft came form the south from mount Haleakala in an amber color and then turned red color and headed west and disappeared into the horizon at a very fast rate of speed.  We viewed form the east.  They were not aircraft and did not flash.  The speed was very high compared to commercial aircraft.  They turned red in color as they turned at a 90 degree then disappeared in to the horizon in about 4 seconds.  They were flying in formations of three in a straight line. Both my wife and myself come from aviation families and my wife currently works in aviation industry.  I served 19 years in the federal govt and am very familiar with military aircraft.  These were not man made aircraft.  We are all of sound mind and very intelligent.  This is not a hoax this REAL WORLD.;20.9071;-156.3

Light would appear bright then disappear and then reappear and move erratically - sometimes striking across the sky and then disappearing.  A few times it seemed to explode into a grouping of smaller lights and then disappears.  Once it appeared as four lights in a perfect square.  Tried to photograph, but couldnâ€™t.;20.9071;-156.3
