Shooting star turns into T UFO, Polihale State Park, HI.;2017-12-29 10:00:00;35 seconds;Shooting star turns into T UFO, Polihale State Park, HI. Last night on the beach, Polihale State Park, HI:  A shooting star caught my eye, I pointed it out to two people who were with me.  We saw the shooting star stop flaring and stop moving.  Next to where it stopped, two stars that were near where the shooter stopped started moving away from each other, opposite directions and equal speed.  The entire shape from shooting star to moving stars looked to form a T.  I looked down for a second to ask the people I was with if they were seeing what I was seeing, they confirmed.  We looked back up and we couldn't find the lights again.;20.5324043478261;-156.77391826087
