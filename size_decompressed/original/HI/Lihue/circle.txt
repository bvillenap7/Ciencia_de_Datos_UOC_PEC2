Circular white object with “Halo” and appears to have 3 dimensions,;2020-08-19 04:30:00;5 minutes;Circular white object with “Halo” and appears to have 3 dimensions, At 0430 hrs 08/19/20, while taking my dog outside to relieve herself, I looked up into the sky to see the stars.  I did not have my prescription glasses on, but an odd “light” caught my eye, appeared to be circular and have a “corona-type” flare all around it, in the southeastern sky. I went back inside to grab my iPhone 7plus and my glasses.  I proceeded to focus on the object with my phone camera and increased the magnification to 10X.  I took 5 photos at 0432, 0433,, again at 0433, 0434 and 0435.  At no time did this object move, it appeared to be just “suspended there.  I will be uploading my photos in order of taking them.  Afterward, I went inside the house, back to sleep.  After I woke up, I re-magnified the clearest of the photos (photo #6). This took place at 0859 hrs.  I posted my findings on Facebook. I then researched and found that both Jupiter and Saturn were visible in our Hawaiian Sky until 0313, and 0353, respectively, only until this morning -08/20/20.  To verify that what I saw, was or was not a planet, I “checked” the sky at 2130, 2230, 2340, last night (0819/20) and again at 0230 this morning (0820/20). Whatever I had captured on my iPhone camera the night before, was no longer there. One of the things that puzzled me about this event, was that in the past I have attempted to photograph the full moon, with this same iPhone camera, and have been unable to even come close to the clarity I achieved while taking photos of this phenomenon.;21.9836999999999;-159.369299999999
