Bright green lights floating in space with a strange motion pattern.;1999-03-14 01:15:00;5 min.;Bright green lights floating in space with a strange motion pattern. While driving back home with a friend, we noticed two bright green lights [same color like a laser beam], a little bigger than the stars on the background. They were floating in space with a slow motion on straight lines, with abrupt change in direction, constant motion with the same pattern while they were gaining altitude, tll we lost the sight of them. At first they were under a low cloud [3,000 feet] making them very easy to see, then they moved on a Westerly direction away from the cloud and we were able to follow them clearly even with the stars on the background. At this point we stopped the car, turned the lights off and got out to get a better view of this weird sight that last for about 5 minutes. What we noticed was a constant size with the increase of altitude, we lost the sight because the brightness and color went less and less. The location was the city of Lihue on the island of Kauai, Hawaii and the lights were SouthWest from us, moving on a Westerly direction. They were not a conventional aircraft [nothing can fly like that so far] or something orbiting the hearth. We are both Airline Pilots and we never seen anything like that before and we were unable to give an explation to it. This is the main reason why we decided to report this strange episode.;21.9836999999999;-159.369299999999
Two Dancing lights rising from the east traveling upwards over Lihue, Kauai just after 1:00 am 30 Sept.;2006-09-30 01:00:00;1 min;Two Dancing lights rising from the east traveling upwards over Lihue, Kauai just after 1:00 am 30 Sept. Two pale blue-green lights were spotted appraching from the east (from direction of Lihue airport).  Figuring it was a plane, it got my attention when there was no noise accompaning them.  I pointed it out to my friend just as one of the lights seemed to pendulum-swing from the light above it and shadow it in a dog-fight like formation.  The lights seemed to almost be connected and seemed to bounce off each other and overlap or collide like two balloons dancing.  The lights went westward over the sky as they appeared to gain altitude until they disappeared straight over ahead within a minute of their first appearance.;21.9836999999999;-159.369299999999

Falling fading lights;2013-04-22 22:45:00;3 minutes;falling fading lights Noiseless steady lights, red, slowly appearing to drop down sky in a slow, random fashion until they were no longer visible (yet still well above horizon at that time).  It appeared to fade in the last few seconds but was not fast moving like meteor would be. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
