Glowing green light twenty feet from me.;2018-12-16 00:00:00;25 minutes;Glowing green light twenty feet from me. I was sleeping and I heard this buzzing noise outside my window so I got up and checked it out.  When I opened my front door, I saw this glowing light about 20 feet from me. It was super bright and almost blinded me.  Then I passed out.   I woke up in my bed and I never remembered getting up and walking to my bed that night.  I got up and found bruises like after you get shots.  It was the scariest moment of my life.;21.9836999999999;-159.369299999999
