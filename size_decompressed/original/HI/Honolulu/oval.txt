Waiakiki April 1983 Sighting at Twin Banyan Towers on Ohua Avenue off Kuhio Avenue moved silently between towers towards the beach.;1983-04-07 23:00:00;30 seconds;Waiakiki April 1983 Sighting at Twin Banyan Towers on Ohua Avenue off Kuhio Avenue moved silently between towers towards the beach. I have been trying to find anyone who vacationed in Hawaii in about April of 1983 at the Twin Banyan towers in Waikiki, Honolulu, Hawaii. While walking on Ohua Avenue towards the beach I looked up and witnessed the most fantastic machine every in my life. It had colored lights reminiscent of the Speilberg multicolors in Close Encounters, but no electro effect, no sound. It was oval to saucer shaped and possibly one hundred to one hundred fifty feet between the above cited twin towers at an angle of about forty degrees. It began to move very slowly in the makai direction, or toward the water direction behind the tower facing towards the beach on block away close to St. Augustine Catholic Church. This was much larger than the scale of the Speilberg special effect, but this was not a movie, it was real life. At that distance it took more than half the angled vertical space between the towers. As it moved, behind the tower I tried to keep a low profile, walking not running towards Kuhio Avenue, across Ohua and around the other side. There was nothing there, and the greatest mystery to me is what happened to it, and only those in the building know where it went. That is why I need an answer, and why I am writing this. Any one of hundreds of people could have photographed this sighting, and people do carry cameras when on vacation, or even video. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
