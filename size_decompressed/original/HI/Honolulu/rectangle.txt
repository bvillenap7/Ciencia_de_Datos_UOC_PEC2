Saw large bus like vehicle;1980-08-12 19:00:00;5 min;Summary : Saw large bus like vehicle One night I was drunk and ((deleted)) out in the yard looking down into the valley of Aina Haina, Honolulu Hawaii. I looked down toward the busy highway and saw this bus like thing above the highway. I squinted and looked again. It was still there. In this valley, there are many dogs but they were not making a peep for hours. A few seconds later the valley erupted with many dogs going crazy all at once. I told my girlfriend Ester to come out and look. I said do you see that thing down there? She said yes, what is that? I said I don't know. It looked like a big bus with lights moving slowly out of our view above the highway. Was I drunk or what? I know all about planes, etc. but was I seeing things or what? I still think about it every once and a while, but I quit drinking years ago--Aloha!;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
