Fireball object in downtown Honolulu that changed direction and hovered.;2013-01-01 21:25:00;2-3 minutes;Fireball object in downtown Honolulu that changed direction and hovered. It moved from north to south, then stopped.  Held position for a number of seconds (I didn't count but long enough for me to walk across the street and up the sidewalk).  I really thought it was something on fire and coming down until it stopped.   I kept staring at it and then it went in reverse and raised up.  It stopped again before going higher and I lost sight of it behind the clouds. I live in downtown Honolulu, the Ala Moana hotel is directly across the road from my apartment, the object was hovering at the level 3/4 from the top of the hotel.   I don't know a floor level or anything. But it was quite odd.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223

This slow moving object looked like a fireball moving slowly.  The size of it was like looking at an airplane or helicopter with lights flashing in the night sky except there were no lights flashing, just looked like something burning moving slowly like maybe fireball?  Took a video from my phone however as I zoomed in with my phone the picture got grainy. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
