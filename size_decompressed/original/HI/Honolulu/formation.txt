Formation flashing bright colored lights over Diamond Head Hawaii;2000-11-09 00:05:00;More than 30 minutes/stil;Formation flashing bright colored lights over Diamond Head Hawaii We noticed flashing color in the sky.  The object is stationary and fashes blue and red.  With binocculars noticed the formation changed from round to square then to octogon shape.  Inside the outside shape was many intricate lines of light.  At first observation it appeared to twinkle.  Above Waikiki we can see many stars and aircraft fly by.  This is unlike anything I have ever seen in my life.  I don't believe in Aliens but this is freaking me out! What in this world could this be? ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.

Series of Star like objects linked together.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-06-03 20:00:00;1 minute;Series of Star like objects linked together. Three objects that looked like stars connected by smaller lights.  They moved in a line together from over diamond head  towards the mountains.  Sort of like three shooting stars connected together but not at all because they were heading in a certain direction.   Seemed to be much lower than the stars.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
Shark formation floats across the pacific islands of Hawaii;2020-10-24 22:01:00;21 seconds;Shark formation floats across the pacific islands of Hawaii Somebody says what is that and I look up. Cloudless still night.  First I fix on the planet Venus which was directly above and then I notice stars moving across my way, from right to left.  I shout those are fucking ufos! And attempt to film. Seeing with my eyes and rewatching a recording are two different things. A witness beside me said the formation looked invisible and that the cloaking reminded him of the invisibility in the game Halo.  It was immense and holds a shape that looked like a shark. Orbs were different diameters. Some trailing exhaust. Some blinking. One was flashing like on fire and it’s flame was reflecting off of itself. I’ve seen other videos of the sighting now so I’m definitely mixing my experience from what many on the island saw.  There’s a report that space debris expected on this day however it was for a different time and in the Atlantic not the Pacific. “CZ-3B ROCKET BODY (ID 33415)“;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
