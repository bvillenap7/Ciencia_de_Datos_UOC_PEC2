Flying Cylinder moving in broad daylight from West to East.;2010-03-14 15:30:00;4 minutes;Flying Cylinder moving in broad daylight from West to East. Standing on Waikiki beach midafternoon on a Sunday.  A moderatly moving cylinder-shaped object moved from West to East at about 1000 ft. up and about 1/2 mile away over the ocean.  That altitude and distance makes it difficult to approximate a size, but my guess is about 5ft in diameter and 30ft long.  The wind was very strong that day at about 15-20 knts, from the Northeast.  At first I thought it was a balloon on its side, but it was not bouncing vertically in the gusty wind.  It was quiet.  It was moving smoothly due West, against a quartering headwind that was gusty and strong.  With the West sun shining directly on it, it reminded me of a white hotwater heater flying horizontally, on its longside, with the end of it pointing toward the beach. It continued till it came about even with Diamond Head crater, in the distance.  It appeared to stop, against the strong winds.  Then, it moved toward Diamondhead without turning.  It moved Northward with the narrow end of the cylinder leading the way.  It stopped close to Diamondhead for less than a minute, then continued West, flying broadside again.  Finally, Diamond head blocked my view of it. The flight path normally used was clear of airliners that day.  Due to the strong Northerly winds, the airliners were much farther South, landing to the North.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
Cylinder hovering over honolulu zoo/waikiki;2011-10-23 17:50:00;2 minutes;Cylinder hovering over honolulu zoo/waikiki I saw with a friend i was driving with. it was funny cause I saw this right after another ufo incident i saw the night before.  The one we saw was a black pod like ufo that was cylindrical in shape and it was black. It just hovered over the honolulu zoo. This was also seen by another friend on kapahulu that was around the same area.  He said that he saw it as a black cylinder/circle once it got over his head and it was right above him.  he also said he saw a type of antenna on it.  It is odd that these sightings are happening right when they are preparing for APEC here. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
