UFO at Kam Drive-In Honolulu Hawaii;1973-06-01 22:30:00;20 seconds;UFO at Kam Drive-In Honolulu Hawaii Was at the Kam Drive-In (Honolulu Hawaii) one night watching some cheesy movie. Something caught my eye and I’d thought someone threw a Frisbee or pizza box over our car. I took a direct look at it and it was something entirely else! It was a large UFO, and it was headed towards the sea. But, it was only about 200’ above and it was about 75-90’ wide. My wife saw it too. It went right over the movie screen and then below the line of sight, hidden by the movie screen itself. You could see the shape due to the reflection of the city lights on the bottom of it. It had a curve to it. No sound whatsoever. Then, other people at the drive-in who saw it started honking their car horns!

Grey disk flying over Hickam AFB.;2000-02-15 12:30:00;1 Minute;Grey disk flying over Hickam AFB. I was walking from my car to my dorm room on Hickam AFB.  It was a sunny day not a cloud was in the sky.   I happened to look up at an airplane that was maybe 20000 to 30000 feet in the air traveling west to east.  A few moments later while still looking at the airplane, I noticed a disk shaped object traveling perpendicular to the airplane, but at a much lower altitude, perhaps 800 to 1500 feet.   This object passed almost directly overhead and moved in a straight line and level altitude.  My guess is this object was 10 to 20 feet in diameter and grey in color.   I observed this object for maybe 20 seconds before walking inside the dormitory.   I must admit becoming a little scared.   When I returned from lunch I told my supervisor what I saw, he speculated the object was a low altitude satellite. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We doubt that a low altitude satellite would be visible during daylight.  We disagree with the assessment apparently made by the supervisor.  PD));21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
