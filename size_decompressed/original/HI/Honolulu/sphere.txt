It was at about a 45 degree angle and out around 5 miles or so.  Then it stopped. At this point it was still quite a ways out. Then it moved upward at lightning speed, then stopped. Then it came down at the same speed to its original position. Then it moved downward,paused, then moved back to the same spot. Then  it moved to the left. then back to same spot. Then it moved right. then back to same spot. then it slowly moved away from the shore going back where it came from until I couldn't see it any more.  This is the first time I have ever publicly disclosed this sighting. I knew then  as I know now, It wasn't from this earth. I was 19 yrs old when that happened. I am now 54. I will never forget that night. I even rubbed my eyes in dis-belief a wew times, but it was real. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

I had turned to look at it, and stood there, perhaps 5-6 feet away from it as it just stayed 4-5 feet above the ground and did nothing---I was facing it---it was the size of a large basketball, or big watermelon-- and, as I recollect, as soon as my brain finally kicked into gear and I began to say to myself, What the hell is that?, it took off, over the northward hill, so fast that all that I saw was a blue line in my vision, so fast that it was out of my sight in a second at most--again, NO NOISE!!  I just finished my route, and at about 10am that same morning, as I sat at my desk, it hit me--What the hell was that??--It seemed that as soon as my mind started to ask what is that?, that it was the catalyst for it to take off---no object could have been accelerated so quickly that we could manufacture-- no doubt in my mind that it was some kind of measuring probe, doing some kind of mapping---it hugged the roof of that house so precisely---like you were making a schematic, or 3-D map---I don't know---but it was there,  I saw it, and I've shared this with, maybe, 5-6 people since 1979---what would be the point?? But I just saw your website on Peter Jenning's show, so I thought I'd let you know---it was not from this planet---guarantee you that--- aloha, ((name deleted)), Kaneohe, HI---808-((number deleted (HST!!) or e-mail to: ((name deleted))@hawaii.rr.com---keep up the good work!!!

I thought it was a star as it flickered between white and red.;2003-09-17 23:30:00;5 minutes;I thought it was a star as it flickered between white and red. My husband and I were on our way to Phoenix from Honolulu.  As our plane leveled off I looked outside of my window and saw what I believed at first to be a bright star, possibly Mars as it would flicker between white and red. About two minutes passed and I looked outside the window again and saw the same star at the same distance as i had seen it prior.  I put my glasses on to see if instead of a star it could be another plane also flying in the same direction as it seemed to be keeping the same pace with our plane. At that time the pilot had put on the seat belt light.  I didn't know why as there was no turbulence at this time.  i couldn't quite make out whether it was another plane or a star.  it wasn't above or below but ahead and to the left of the plane and eye level.  a few more minutes passed and suddenly the object seemed to make a sharp right as though it was about to fly in front of our plane.  At first i thought that maybe the plane had veered left that would account for this shape to seem as though it was going to the right, but i had been on airplanes numerous times to know how it feels when a plane veers left or right.  Maybe it's nothing but if someone else saw this i would appreciate it if they would report it.                .;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
The object was a slightly illuminated brownish/orange sphere, barely visible in the night sky.;2003-12-27 20:00:00;5 min;The object was a slightly illuminated brownish/orange sphere, barely visible in the night sky. I work at the HNL international airport, while at work this particular evening something cought my eye in the night sky out towards the ocean. It was a slightly illuminated brownish/orange, sphere shaped object that wasent going anywhere.It just hung there in mid air. Anyways I grabbed a set of binoculars that I carry with me in my truck and managed to focus on the object just as it started to move out towards the ocean and out of range. About 5 min later a streak of light shot across the sky coming from the direction the object went to and then disapeared into a cloud. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I immediately looked up and what I saw was a brilliantly lit, sphere shaped, bright orange object, silently slipping thru the atmosphere at a fairly high rate of speed from a north to south direction. The object appeared to be close to the ground opposed to being up in space. Possibly the altitude of a low flying airplane just above the clouds. The size could be compared to a street lamp at about 100 yards away. I thought it could possibly be the space station but the object seemed so close and too large to be the space station in my opinion. I work at the airport around helicopters and fixed wing aircraft and I can positively rule them all out without a doubt. The 90 degree angle that I saw the object (directly below) with nothing behind it,no sound and the high rate of speed. It appeared to be a flying light bulb with no tail.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
One minute sighting of massive football sized sphere about 2000 ft up;2006-10-05 19:45:00;1 minute;One minute sighting of massive football sized sphere about 2000 ft up Thursday October 5th at approximately 7:45pm I was out on the back lanai (porch) of the 26th floor of my building putting my dinner dishes to dry in the hot outside air. The cloud formation next to the full moon that night was very unusual so I kept staring at it. It became more solid white and then something lowered through it. The shape of the object was spherical and very massive, about 2000 ft. up.  The sides of the sphere were tall, it was not a flat sphere.  My son was present with me and he became frightened and ran inside. Then as the sphere lowered more over the Ala Wai canal, just a little west of Diamond Head Crater, a green channel of light was extended down from the craft and that channel of light did not touch any of the apartment buildings or the street below. I called son back to see the channel of light and he described the same thing that I saw, that the green channel of light did not touch all the way down.  The object we saw lasted only one minute in the sky above us.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
blueish greenish ball of light;2009-05-03 20:55:00;5 seconds;blueish greenish ball of light It was a blueish greenish ball with a light yellowish tail.  It was falling from the sky and then disappeared.  I was in my mom's apartment on Alexander St. in Honolulu looking out the sliding glass door towards Kaimuki and it suddenly appeared.  No one else saw it because it was too quick when I told my son to look it disappeared.  She lives right next to the freeway and I'm wondering if anyone else saw it.  It was awesome!!;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223

I couldn't get the size of them but they seemed to be traveling fast I'd say something around 400 hundred miles an hour.but the clouds were going fast from east to west from Molokai to Oahu and the spheres were traveling from north to south.  But then all at the same time and when no clouds were near them they just disappeared then after a few seconds they reappeared and then again gone then very clearly reappeared .  I'd guess altitude was 4to5 k ft,I was 82nd and jumped for years sport jumping as well so I think I know altitudes.then 5 min.1 more came into view and this one was small same direction.then I saw a friend who I told and he didn't say much,then again this time 3 more ,same direction all small then gone into the clouds. I tol! d my friend look there 3 of them right there but he said he had bad eyes.  just like turning the off switch of there cloaking device twice and then left it on.cool.I can't stop watching the sky.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
bright, fast moving orb over ala moana beach park.  ((NUFORC Note:  Overflight of ISS at 05:55 hrs., on this date.  PD));2011-08-12 06:00:00;2 minutes;Bright, fast moving orb over ala moana beach park At approximately 5:55 am HST, right before i went out surfing in the morning, i looked up and witnessed somewhat of an orb moving fast over me. It was really high in altitude, much higher than any plane yet at that high above, it must have been really HUGE and it was moving fast.  I called over 2 of my friends and yelled out to look above just to see what i was witnessing. What we saw didnt make any noise, it was moving really fast faster than any plane or satellite, and the kicker was that it traveled horizontally like a plane and THEN it went diagonally up to the stars to the point were it looked like a far and distant star/planet.   We watched this thing for about a couple of minutes till it disappeared not over the horizon like any man made machine but high above us at a 45 degree angle.  There were no blinking lights like a plane and wasnt shaped like one either. ((NUFORC Note:  Overflight of ISS at 05:55 hrs., on this date.  PD));21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
Orbs dropping larger orbs into the ocean.;2013-11-21 11:00:00;5 minutes;Orbs dropping larger orbs into the ocean. Thursday, November 21st, 2013 Sandy Beach, Oahu, Hawaii   Sometime between 11am and noon local time, my son and I were walking along Sandy Beach watching the bodysurfers when my son yelled, “Whoa, did you see that?”  I did not see anything while we were on the beach but my son, who is 13, was quite impressed with what he witnessed.  Below is his story in his own words:  “We were watching the bodysurfers surfing the waves.  I was standing near this big rock right by the ocean, looking out over the horizon when I saw an orb that was bright white, almost like a florescent light bulb but sphere shaped.  The orb was about as big as a grapefruit.  It had come from thin air, going very fast but slowed to a halted hover in a very small space.   As soon as it slowed, it dropped an orb that looked the same as the other one but just bigger, like a soccer ball.  The bigger orb dropped in the water and made a small splash.  The small orb hovering in the air flew off and disappeared in a flash, literally.   I looked down at the water where the orb had fallen but there was nothing there even though I saw a little splash.   I looked in the sky again to see if there were more orbs.  I scanned the horizon and saw more of these occurrences but they were further away.  The first sighting was very fast, probably two and a half to three seconds long.  The other sightings lasted longer because the orbs traveled further than my first sighting.   Then, after the last orb (the fifth or sixth one) dropped its load of a larger orb, the orbs all vanished. “;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
Green spherical “Orb” traveling exceedingly fast east to west at apparent low altitude over Oahu.;2019-09-09 20:00:00;5-10 seconds;Green spherical “Orb” traveling exceedingly fast east to west at apparent low altitude over Oahu. Spherical object. Phosphorescent green. Moving east to west at amazing speed. Object appeared to be extremely low. It passed over valley in less than 1 second (valley +/-  .75 miles across). When directly overhead object appeared to be the size is a “normal” chewing gum ball. I was certain the object would collide into the valley ridge. It did not. The trajectory would have let the object pass over central Oahu but there were no reports of the object nor reports of falling/colliding objects. Estimating speed of object difficult but based upon a comparative analysis of commercial jet aircraft that take approximately the same vector daily, one could assume the UFO was traveling in excess of 3000 mph (perhaps significantly faster). No  trailing sparks or fumes. No sound.  Lasting impressions:  1. Appeared very low yet cleared all obstacles (path was linear). 2. The glowing green color was firm no radiating haze. 3. Amazing no one else saw this albeit it’s speed was astronautical.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
