Slow moving 'star' flys across Honolulu skyline.;2001-12-26 05:25:00;15 seconds;Slow moving 'star' flys across Honolulu skyline. At 5:25 a.m., my girl friend and I were driving to church on the H-1 freeway in Kalihi just past the Pali Highway on ramp, when I saw a dot (about the size of a planet or good size star) in the sky that moved from directly infront and above (about 45 degrees above the horizon) of my car towards the north-east, over the Koolau mountains.  By the time I said, 'What's that up there?' and my girl friend glanced up, the dot disappeared out of view.  I know this wasn't a meteor because we had just seen the Leonid meteor shower just a few weeks prior and this object moved much slower and didn't leave a trail.  The object took about 5-8 seconds to traverse half the sky.  I've been told that it could have been a satellite but being the winter time, the sun wasn't going to be rising for over an hour plus I'm not familiar with there being many satellites flying south to north over the islands, they're usually east to west.  It could have been a plane too, but there weren't any other lights except for just that one dot, and there wasn't any sillouette as it crossed other stars.  Also, I've never seen aircraft flying over the sky that early in the morning and going in that particular direction.  F.Y.I.  I periodically stargaze on early Sunday mornings. In an unrelated event, sometime in 1995 or 96, I recall seeing a series of bright blue light beams shooting up from a fixed point along the Koolau mountain ridge near the Pali Highway area.  This blast of 3-4 distinct beams shot up like a spot light and lit up the sky and clouds in the area.  The beams moved very fast and independantly of each other (some angled as low as 45 degrees to the horizon), however it only lasted for about 5 seconds.  Keep in mind that there are no houses that far up on the ridges and why anyone whould have powerful spotlights that deep in the woods for a 5 second show is beyond me.  This was viewed by my roommate and I while we were talking outside our appartment walkway on the 7th floor (located on the corner of ((deleted)) St. & Kapiolani Blvd.) at around 10 p.m.  Nothing was ever mentioned about it on the tv news or the newspapers the next day.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
saw bright flame across sky twice, followed by tiny red lights, one moving in a sprial pattern and others stationary in the sky.;2004-10-21 20:30:00;couple minutes;saw bright flame across sky twice, followed by tiny red lights, one moving in a sprial pattern and others stationary in the sky. I was getting on the freeway heading east, when out of the corner of my eye I saw what looked like the flame from the bottom of a space shuttle taking off, butit was on its side instead of being in an upright position.  I saw it off to my right, which would be west, at first and it blasted like across the sky for a short distance, then it went out and then a few seconds later appeared once again with the same kind of high power looking kind of flame.  I could not get a view of anything in front of this flame, the night sky was dark and i couldn't see any objects against it, nor could i get a feel of how far or close this object was.  Then I saw the flame go out and I then noticed many tiny red lights in the sky all around the area where this other bright flame that I had just seen was. I noticed one of the red lights move up in the sky in a spiral like manner.  I also noticed that the some of the other red lights were blinking and moving a little but not alot.  Like I said before I was getting on the freeway when the lights first caught my attention, so I was still driving and watching this whole thing happen as much as I could without getting in an accident.  I took my eyes off the lights for a couple seconds to make sure I wasn't about to hit somebody on the freeway, when I turned back to look again there was nothing in the sky, it was gone.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
If a picture is worth 1000 words than this one is worth $1,000,000!;2006-07-30 14:12:00;5 minutes;If a picture is worth 1000 words than this one is worth $1,000,000! DISCLAMER: I don't believe in UFO's or aliens from another world!  So posting this is not easy for me, but this is too unexplainable to keep all to myself. This entire event happened within a five minute period and I had 4 other eyewitnesses.  I noticed this object in the sky while helping my son fly a kite in the park. It took me about thirty seconds to realize it was not a kite as it was about 300 feet higher than the kite I was flying. The object seemed to be stationary, but I soon realized that it was slowly moving higher and vertical.  As I ran to another friend also flying a kite and asked him what's that in the sky he was baffled as well. I then grabbed my camera and start taking pictures. My camera is expensive and takes great shots but I'm an amateur photographer and could not lock the focus on an object that was moving away, getting smaller and had nothing but blue sky's and clouds as a backdrop.  I took a total of 10 pictures and to my amazement, one out of ten came out perfectly clear (by luck) to reveal something that is very hard to explain. I cannot describe the object other than it looks like a very large white camera with a large lens looking downward with four booster rockets and two fuel pods all of which are perfectly symmetrical in shape!  Yeah, I know crazy huh?  As I tried to rationalize what it might be, I dismissed that it was a weather balloon, US aircraft, satellite and defiantly not a kite. What ever it was, it wasn't moving with the wind and it was still visible far beyond the cloud layer meaning that the sunlight was reflecting off of this object.  I dare not show or send this photo out to anyone unless they are willing to pay very well for it. If there really are aliens and spaceships from another world, I may have one of few real pictures as proof!  The most logical but still crazy explanation I can come up with other than it being from another world is that some foreign country has developed advance spying technology that can silently hover over American land and then return home at altitudes over 40,000 feet!;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223

Yellow or gold aerodynamic looking object near Hickman AFB at an unknown distance from camera.;2009-11-07 10:26:00;Unknown;Yellow or gold aerodynamic looking object near Hickman AFB at an unknown distance from camera. While looking south from the USS Arizona Memorial, I noticed occasional military aircraft landing at Hickman AFB.  I decided to take a couple of photos of the aircraft, despite having only a 24-70mm zoom.  Of the three photos I took, one includes an unknown yellow or gold object at an unknown distance.  I didn't see this object until I viewed my photographs one week later.  At the time of the photo, the aircraft did not interact with or chase the object.  Probably didn't see it.  I know I didn't see it at the time.  My first guess is an airborne hat, much close to me than the aircraft.  But, since I can't tell, I thought I would sent along this report.

My First UFO Sighting?;2014-05-01 15:30:00;5 seconds;My First UFO Sighting ? I was driving along Sand Island Parkway this late afternoon when I heard and saw 2 fighter aircraft took off from Honolulu International Airport.  The timing was a little unusual for USAF daily training take-off.   After a gradual ascent, the first fighter aircraft took a steep climb.  The second fighter aircraft came along and did the same thing and I follow the direction of their path.   It was then when I saw two white crescent UFOs flying one after another into a group of cotton clouds.   I stood and waited for 15 minutes for the UFO to exit from the other side of the clouds but it never did.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
Moving yellow-orange orb seen by myself for about 20 seconds before passing behind cloud, have tech background to r/o normal objects;2015-07-29 20:20:00;~20 seconds;Moving yellow-orange orb seen by myself for about 20 seconds before passing behind cloud, have tech background to r/o normal objects On 7-29-15 at approximately 2020, I was returning to my apartment on the 16th floor walkway of our high rise condo building and noted that the sky was partly cloudy with cumulus clouds, the almost full moon was out, and a few stars visible.  I then noted in my peripheral vision another bright object in the northern sky, at about 70 degrees elevation.  Initially, I assumed it was Jupiter, being yellow-white in color and bright, but this object’s magnitude (brightness) was actually somewhere between Jupiter and Venus when I looked directly at it.  Then I realized that Jupiter/Venus had been in conjunction in the western sky lately and could not be the object.  I am also familiar with the appearance of stars, other planets, and the time of year they are visible. This was different, in that the object appeared as a steady orb and to my surprise was moving downward in a northerly linear/ballistic direction with relation to the building overhang.  There might have been some slight wobble side to side, but being familiar with auto- kinesis, I could not rule this out as the cause.   I looked to see if the object had any lesser peripheral lighting such as aircraft position/navigation or anti-collision lights, but none were apparent.  I thought it strange if this was a landing light of an airplane that it is usually not totally and consistently visible at that angle when moving away (plus it tends to waiver due to aircraft movement and atmospherics).  I could not tell the exact altitude of the object, but it seemed as high as an aircraft might traverse or maybe even higher.  It was visible while moving for perhaps 20 seconds before disappearing behind a cloud and not re-emerging on either side.  Frankly, for lack of a better description, it! reminded of the scenes from the movie “Close Encounters of a Third Kind”, which depict the spacecraft crisscrossing the sky at altitude, albeit in this case at a little slower speed.  A friend suggested that it might have been a commercially available drone flown by an individual, but it seems unlikely as it was at least at about 2-3 thousand feet in altitude in order to pass behind the prevailing cumulus clouds (which were forming about 1-2 thousand feet at the time), and they would have probably lost track and control of it.  Additionally, the lighting was not pinpoint, diode, or laser like. Strangely, no noise was noted, which would usually be heard from an aircraft/airliner, as the back side of the building is normally quiet. Furthermore, the closely adjacent low mountain ridge (only a couple of hundred feet away) and our building form sort of a bowl for collecting sound.  Surface winds were light and would not have distracted much from any sound. I also thought maybe it could be a weather balloon being illuminated at high altitude where the sun was still striking it, since it was only 2020 and the sun sets later in summer, so I cannot totally rule this out.  I do not know what the prevailing high altitude winds were at the time.  However, I do recall when I previously observed such balloons and even satellites in the past, that they tend to oscillate in brightness due to the changing sun reflection off the envelope or shifting hard surfaces. This is the first time I have experienced something like this in all my 58 years and believe that if others in the east Oahu area of Hawaii Kai (City & County of Honolulu) were looking in the same direction at the same time, they would have easily seen it.  I am contemplating contacting the Honolulu Star Advertiser local newspaper on this matter to see if any others reported this.  I now have a greater appreciation for those who say they didn’t have time to take a photo or get other witnesses, as I was just outside my apartment and briefly contemplated rushing to get my wife and son to come out, but now realize that if I had done so, it would not have been in time and I would have missed part of the event. With respect to my background, I have a past that includes aviation (private pilot single engine land & sea rating, licensed FAA aircraft mechanic with ratings for airframe & powerplant, former FAA air traffic controller Tower trainee, including National Weather Service observer training, did some aviation accident investigation for worldwide aircraft insurers through AirClaims in Hawaii & Alaska, and have a bachelor’s degree in Aviation Administration from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University-which included coursework in flight physiology).  I have also been an avid amateur astronomer since childhood, having built and owned various telescopes and taken several formal college level courses in the subject (including astrophotography). I most recently worked the last 23 years as an acute inpatient psychiatric RN at a major hospital in Honolulu after getting my nursing degree.  I also completed some graduate level education in nursing. Given the aforementioned, I believe that I am somewhat familiar with aerial and astronomy phenomena and have been able to be clinically objective in my appraisal of anything I have seen, but this episode was unusual and unexplained.

I was awakened around 3:30 am and I was lying in my bed wondering why I had woke up.   Then something outside on my back lanai caught my eye.  My louver windows were closed but I saw a reddish-orange floating light outside the window.  It was about 5 ft. in the air.   Then 2-3 more of the same kind of lights appeared, making the total number of lights outside the window to being 4.  They seemed to be interested in the string of pinkish- red colored lights that I had on my lanai that were on at the time.  Then one of the lights left the others and flew close to my bathroom window that is located towards the back of the lanai behind the washer and dryer.   When the light came close to the bathroom window, which was also closed it illuminated the bathroom with a reddish -orange light.  It then floated back to join the other lights that were still floating in the air.  They remained there for awhile, about 15-20 minutes.  Then they just disappeared.   I was frozen sitting in my bed. I was frightened by it and didn't get a friendly feeling from these lights. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Hyper-Flight;2018-03-17 09:00:00;4 seconds;Hyper-Flight It was about 9 am or a few minutes earlier when three of us were gathering into a rented suv to go to a ceremony in Waikiki (St. Augustine Church) for a presentation from Portugal regarding a statue being presented (Our Lady of Fatima). Before boarding I noticed a mult-colored helicoptor approaching from the west to east (sunrise).  It caught my eye whereupon I noticed way above it an extremely bright jet shaped object (no wings or tail fins and brilliant white) streaming across the sky.  The tail had an inverted thruster as compared to an extended or protruding one such as many jet fighters enjoy.  It had an extreme altitude (higher than civil flights), was about the size of a battle ship, no sound whatsoever, and crossed the entire clear sky in less than 4 seconds.  Before I could call attention to it...... it disappeared into the sunrise.  I couldn't believe the speed of this object!  No missle on earth could possibly approach this speed.  Second time in my life I've ever seen something like this.  The 1st time was when I was 13.  I'm 70 years old, as of sighting.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
