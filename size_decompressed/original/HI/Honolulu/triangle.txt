Very bright, firm triangular formation of lights -- solid, hanging and moving silently, 100 feet above the building.;2002-01-02 22:05:00;2 min;Very bright, firm triangular formation of lights -- solid, hanging and moving silently, 100 feet above the building. I live in Honolulu, Hawaii.  I was stone cold sober, awake and lucid, and I know the following event was real. Later this evening, aprox. 10:05 pm - Jan, 2, 2002... I was heading into Waikiki on Punahou street -- many buildings ahead of me -- above the Pan Am building 3, maybe 4 blocks away, I saw a huge triangular formation of extremely bright, white lights.  Very clearly!!!  They made the following shape [example: below] * *      * *     * *      * * Though it was facing more horizontal (thiner on the leading edge) than the limits of my typed diagram will allow. ((NUFORC Note:  The pattern did not survive transferring to the database.  )) Immediately I studied it closely to be sure of what I was seeing.  My two sons were in the car with me and saw it also!  I was driving toward it, but the end of the road came and I had to turn the corner.  Before I lost sight of it, it was moving, hovering gently above the buildings -- its left wing dipped slightly and the nose pivioting [the lights held formation solid and firm -- it was a solid object!!!) out to sea. By the time I got through traffic, to its exact location, it was gone -- vanished.  Its lights and its size (slightly larger than the building's rooftop) were so obviously unlike any other kind of aircraft, period! When I arrived to the spot there were no lights, aircraft, crowds, promotinal events... nothing else that could have been mistaken for what I saw. This was real.  It wasn't my imagination.  The object was soild and obvious!!!  From this day forword, at least I will know!!!  I have seen solid physical evidence myself. I called the police, the FAA, the airport (was it too low for radar) in hopes of confirmation from others who may have seen it, with no results.  I was finally led to a number to the University of Hawaii -- an answering machine.  I left my message... We'll see.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
3 trangular UFOs were spotted in a triangle formation for 3 seconds.;2004-10-11 01:00:00;2-3 seconds;3 trangular UFOs were spotted in a triangle formation for 3 seconds. My family was driving down the road at about 1:00 am and as soon as we were passing over a bridge, we saw three aircraft hovering in the air above our car. As they passed over out car, our car suddenly died and wouldn't activate until the crafts were out of visual contact. As these craft glidded acros teh air above us, they seemed to be flying in a triangular formation. Each appeared to be the size of a full moon. After about 3 seconds after we spotted them, they quickly ascended until they seemed to be the size of  a metal nut. This occured in only 1/2 a second. after this, there was a bright flash around the area where they were in teh sky and they disappeared.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
Honolulu Hawaii - Strange Triangle aircraft  preforming maneuvers with short contrails Intersecting each other;2010-04-19 15:00:00;30 Minutes;Honolulu Hawaii - Strange Triangle aircraft  preforming maneuvers with short contrails Intersecting each other 04/19/2010 Location: Honolulu Hawaii - South Shore off of Diamond Head Time: 1500-1530 Craft - Triangles (3)  I watched contrails go up high into sky in unusual flight pattern. This is what caught my attention. I continued to watch at each stoplight as I drove home down Nimitz drive towards Waikiki. I did noticed two contrails following each other in rocket like arc. Then they would cross each other. I got home and looked at object with a pair of binoculars. There were three at this time. Only one came close enough for me to get a good look (about 8 seconds) I could clearly see that the closest object was a very bright silver triangle (could be from the bright sun reflection) the objects left short contrails that were shaped like a snakes tongue. These objects would perform criss cross maneuvers and sudden upward and downward arcs. I watched as a third object began to sort of dogfight with the two others. This was very high in the sky. Way above normal air traffic. After about another 5 minutes they disappeared out of site heading towards Molokai. I took about 10 photos. None are ve! ry good I only can see the contrails. The maneuvers did not seem out of this world. I was watching because they looked to be possibly, my first thought, cloud seeding because of the patterns. I don’t think that was the case because the contrails were so short. I will attach some pictures. Did anyone else notice these strange aircraft?;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
Two silver triangular craft performing extreme nautical maneuvers in unison high in the air in a blue cloudless sky.;2011-10-14 10:00:00;~2 minutes;Two silver triangular craft performing extreme nautical maneuvers in unison high in the air in a blue cloudless sky. I left my house at about 10:00 a.m., on my way to pick up a friend. Recently there have been (more than usual) very loud military aircraft flying overhead, and I heard one.  I stopped on the walkway to see what kind of plane it was, and saw a jet, a military F-15 or something (small 1 or 2 man plane), flying loudly from right to left.  It had probably just taken off from Hickam AFB.  It flew out of sight, and I looked at the sky to see if there were any more, though I didn’t hear any. Then I saw something kind of sparkling and thought it was another one, only this time much higher in the sky. I watched it and could see that there were two seemingly identical but separate objects, flying together in exact and tight formation, both bright shiny silvery and thin triangular/arrowhead shaped, and flying very fast and very high in tight, eccentric circular movements. I first thought they might be two birds flying together, but they were so high up and so large that they would have had to be giant pterodactyls or some other mythical giant silver birds. No, they were definitely not birds. I watched them for about two minutes and they could not have been military jets, as no aircraft I had ever seen or heard of could perform such maneuvers at those heights and speeds. I kind of waved my hands in front of my eyes to make sure I wasn't seeing things and was sure that I wasn't hallucinating or delusional. I  was, however, a bit startled. I had not been drinking or taking drugs. I went back into the house, as I had forgotten to take an item with me. When I returned to the walkway, they were gone or out of sight. I am currently retired after working the past 26 years as a medical transcriptionist. I had never previously seen a UFO.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
Bright blue triangular outline, oscillating yellow/orange/green lights along the outline over NE skies of honolulu;2014-10-31 11:45:00;1.5 hours +;Bright blue triangular outline, oscillating yellow/orange/green lights along the outline over NE skies of honolulu At above time I looked out a window into the N.E. sky from Alewa Heights area. Naked eye observed what appeared to be a very bright star not see in that sky before. It appeared to sparkle and flash.  Thought it was an incoming plane or military helo. After ten minutes it hadn't moved. I got a small pair of binoculars 8x23 (365 ft. at 1000 yds). Zero'd the light which appeared as a straight blue line, with flashing yellow light oscillating from one end to the other.  As I focused it became an elongated triangle, constant clear bright blue outline with multi color flash bursts of yellow, light orange and greens all along it's outer outline. It was very brilliant, stationary, and clearly outlined in shape. We spotted for an hour and a half, until clouds obscured it.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
