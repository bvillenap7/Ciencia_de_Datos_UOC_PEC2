Object must have been very large, since sighting was from about a mile away. On this night there was a full moon out.  I had been fishing on the south shore of O'ahu, at a place called Black Point-a luxurious residential area.  It's only a mile to the east of Diamond Head crater. The sighting was very brief, and I doubted myself for a while, until two black helicopters showed up a few minutes later.  Then I figured that I must have seen something real.  Initially, I was startled by the helicopters because I did not hear or see them until they were directly in front of me at a distance of about two to three hundred hards.  They continued to scan the areas just beyond the fringing reef from Diamond Head to Hanauma bay (a distance of about 10 miles) with strobe type lights pointed at the water.  This went on for about 30 minutes.  Then they left and so did I.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223

Pacific Standard time, I saw in the northeastern sky a series of random light bursts that were clearly not fireworks or an airplane. I could not identify the outline of a UFO, but the movement of the light bursts was bizarre. The light bursts seemed to be jumping in a random pattern, not a straight line, within a small patch of sky. I am certain this was not an airplane or fireworks if not a UFO, it could have been a satellite. The only other time I have seen anything similar to this was in the eastern sky in the late 1970s, off of Lanikai on eastern Oahu, Hawaii.   May 20, 2004 Writing this at 10:15 P.M.

Strange light over Honolulu just before sunrise, varying in number and light intensity.;2005-08-18 05:30:00;about 10 mins;Strange light over Honolulu just before sunrise, varying in number and light intensity. While working security during the early morning of the 18th of August 2005, just before sunrise at 0530 HST, I heard a few of the neighborhood dogs barking.   I walked to the back of the property I was watching, a residential street, and I did not see any cars or people.  There may have been a stray cat around, but I didn't see anything.  I glanced up at the sky, which was still dark except on the eastern ridge of Manoa valley, when I saw a bright light with what appeared to be a lit cone area in front of it, like how a car with headlights on at night would appear from high up.   There were no clouds in the sky.   I assumed it was a helicopter overhead to survey traffic, but there wasn't any sound at all.  I couldn't tell at what height or distance it was at since it was dark, but it was overhead and to the west, and I was facing west.   As I looked at the object, the spotlight in front of it dimmed, and the light faded to the size of a large star.   I was about to dismiss it as an airplane, but the light suddenly stopped in midair, where before it had been moving towards me.  As it stayed there suddenly a faint light colored haze burst around it from all side, like smoke from a candle when its blown out, or the aura of the sun, only larger and more faint. It disappeared just as suddenly, making me second guess even myself.   Sorry if my description was vague.   As I watched the light, it seemed to separate into two smaller, dimmer lights, and then into three. The lights were the color of the stars and I would not have noticed them if I hadn't seen the larger light earlier.  The lights then moved to the northwest and stayed equidistant from each other, and although it was hard to tell in the dim light, I believe the spaces in between the light was a paler color then the surrounding sky.  The lights continued moving lower and lower on the northwestern horizon of the western ridge of Manoa valley.   The lights moved at a somewhat fast speed, but were observable for about four or five minutes since they stopped intermittently.   Just before they disappeared from view, I believe i saw the lights separate, veer away in arcs and then join together.  The time when I lost sight of them was 0542 HST.  I should note that I was not up all night.  I had just woken up for work 2 hours before and had gotten 6 hours of sleep the night before.  I am not superstitious, religous, and do not believe in ghosts or UFOs, or at least I didn't.   I have never hallucinated or fainted, and am not on any drugs, medications, or other physiologically or psychologically altering substances.   I looked around during the sighting repeatedly and when I looked back up the lights were still there.  Unfortunately, no one was around to bear witness to what I saw.   Pardon any misspellings or grammatical errors my hands are still trembling half a day later.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223

The incident occurred at approximately 7:1;2007-12-21 19:14:00;2 minutes;On the evening of December 21, 2007, I was driving on Interstate H-1 on the island of Oahu.  The incident occurred at approximately 7:13 pm Hawaii Standard Time (UTC-10) and I was on my way home after attending a Christmas party at the Pearl Ultralounge.   The night was black, no stars, with light, intermittent rain falling.  As I drove down H-1, there were numerous other cars present when the incident occurred.   I observed in the sky an unusual aircraft flying overhead from the mountains towards the Pacific Ocean with two extremely bright lights (a small white light, and an extremely bright pink light) far too bright to be normal anti-collision lights.  My estimation is that the distance of the object from myself was probably less than five miles.  The object appeared to be operating at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet above ground level and maintained steady altitude as it headed towards the ocean, flying above what appeared to be the Kalihi area.  During that time, green fireworks were being fired over the city at that time, but the object I observed was by no means the explosion of a firework or a signal flare because it did not suddenly ascend or slowly descend as one might expect of a parachute-retarded flare rather, the object moved slowly on a level flight path from the mountains to the ocean.   I could not see any distinguishing features on the object, because its lights were so bright.  As I drove down the road, I continued to visually track the object for a period of approximately two minutes, when suddenly the object disappeared completely.  I must emphasize strongly that the object did not fade away or fly behind a building or mountain causing it to be obscured from view, but rather completely vanished as if one minute it was there, the next minute it was gone. That evening I was completely alert, not fatigued in any way, and I had not consumed any alcoholic beverages.  I am not currently taking any form of medication and I am in good health.   My estimation is at that time of night and level of traffic, many people must have seen the object from H-1.  I was extremely disturbed by what I saw and felt compelled to report it.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223

Two craft seen by diamond head/kahala honolulu;2014-05-16 21:30:00;2 minutes;Two craft seen by diamond head/kahala honolulu On Friday night of May 16, 2014, I was looking out my bedroom window over diamond head.  I noticed two objects in the sky that appeared to be moving closer.  However, one craft moved in line with the first one and stayed stationary for a over a minute.  I ran outside to call my dad who also witnessed the event.  As we went to reach for our cameras to document the evidence.   The two craft moved backwards very slowly until they could not be seen anymore.  It was weird because they were not planes and the craft seemed to have no directionality in their movement, except when they retracted and moved off.   The shape of the crafts, as I assume they were, appeared to be a in a triangular almost dome shape.  The top and sides where clearly illuminated in a bright red, almost the color of a red stop light.  The bottom of the crafts, had no illumination.   There were no sounds emitted, nor where there any sudden fast movements.  It almost was as if, they appeared out of nowhere and then moved away.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223

I went on my balcony to have a cigarette with my girlfriend.  I was enjoying the half moon and the round glow around it. I then noticed 2 red lights flashing and every once in a while they would flash gold.  One was following the other.  Then the one behind went higher and it seemed like they were beginning to descend.  The angle was slightly diagonally.  It or they were super low and flying slow over the valley and towards the mountain.  The event lasted 3 minutes or so, before losing sight behind a building.  I live in Honolulu close to Makiki and Punchbowl Cemetary.  I got the chills when we saw this.   Would love to know if anyone else saw this and of course, what it was.   Thank you kindly!;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223

As it get closer to land i niticed a white light in front of it going at the exact same speed and stayed directly in feont of the chopper.  As a veteran and living here in HI I've seen tons of military helicopters and can even hear the rotor difference from inside of the house.  I've never seen one fly so fast over the east side and looked like it was chasing the solid white object.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
