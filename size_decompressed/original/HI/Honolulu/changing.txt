Sometimes I pull out my phone and video them, the videos are on average approximately Thirty Seconds to a few minutes.  I saw this helicopter and heard it flying directly all over my head traveling towards the North. I pulled out my cell phone figured I get a little video.  It was hard to get it in the frame.  When I did I noticed the the helicopter change shape, it was now almost invisible white circle with a dot In the middle of it.  I could see it in the screen on my telephone as well as with my naked eye. (I should say barely see it) I saw it blink back and as if blinking in and out of existence. couple times and then stay in the Smoky invisible Circle shape for half a minute or so.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
