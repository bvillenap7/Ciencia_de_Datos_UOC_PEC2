Then it displayed a white light strobe effect then it zipped away really fast! Hello,  I witnessed flashing lights in the night time skies facing north on the island of oahu. It was a little cloudy so I thought it was a typical plane with its flashing lights. This one caught my eye because the flashing lights were not flying like a typical plane or helicopter. It flashed red lights then white lights then made a strobe effect white light! What made me believe this was a UFO was the fact that it speeded away really fast. Not like a fighter jet that I typically see over Hickam Air Force Base but so much faster than that.  Take it for what it's worth. I saw what I saw.  Thank you and Happy Holidays!;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
