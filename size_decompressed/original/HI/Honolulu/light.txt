Strange sights in the sky over Oahu from about 1994 to 2004 seen by long-time resident;1994-01-01 00:00:00;varies;Strange sights in the sky over Oahu from about 1994 to 2004 seen by long-time resident I'm so glad I found this site.  I was born and raised in Honolulu, and have spent a lot of time outdoors looking at the night sky.  I am sober I don't use any drugs and seldom drink.  Over the years I have seen a quite a few things I could not explain in the skies above Oahu. I'm glad to have a place to share them here.  At the times these things happened I was either alone, or with one person and it was wierd not to be able to talk about them.  ABOUT THE TIMES AND DATES, THE FORM HERE DOESN'T FIT.  THESE THINGS OCCURED BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY 1994 AND THE PRESENT AND VARIOUS TIMES AND LOCATIONS ON OAHU.  MOST WERE ONLY WITNESSED BY ME BUT ONE OR TWO WERE WITNESSED BY OTHERS.  First of all the most recent thing was in the ocean outside Waikiki.  This occured approximately around 2002 or 2003.  On more than one occasion, I saw lights I could not explain in the ocean outside of Waikiki.  I saw these from Kaimana beach on the eastern end of Waikiki at the foot of Diamond Head.  There were yellow lights.  They did not behave either like airplaces or boats.  They were above the water. If I remember correctly they looked like flares (Although they were much larger, larger and brighter than stars or airplanes).  Their movements made no sense.  If I remember correctly, they burned brightly in one place and then sank slowly and disappeared before they hit the water.  They were perhaps a mile or more out to sea, seemingly directly out from Kaimana.  I saw these bright yellow lights on more than on occasion.  If I remember correctly there were more than one in a row.  My friend, a social worker, also saw then and we were freaked out.  Perhaps around 1994 I saw the most spectacular thing.  It was twilight at Queen's surf in Waikiki.  To the West, out to sea from Makakilo and Waianae, hundreds of feet up in the sky, I saw a spectacular display.  Fluorescent green squiggles appeared high in the sky, one after another.  They would fade and more would appear.  This went on for a while.  It looked like someone air brushing designs on a T-shirt.  This was NOT the green flash people sometimes see in Hawaii after the sunset.  In spite of the fact that thousands of people should have seen this, I found no mention of it in the media, and I checked. I think I also checked somewhere like Bishop Museum which has astronomers and people like that.  No one else reported it.  One friend speculated that it must have been was rockets or missiles launched from the military base on Kauai [which would probably be Barking Sands].  This occurance was spectacular,unmistakeable, distinct and went on for a while.  At other times, I've seen lights in the night sky that seem to behave in odd ways if they were to be aircraft.  This could be their movement, or brightness.  Most of these I've seen from Kahala or near Sandy Beach.  Perhaps some from Waikiki.  I don't remember the details that much now, just thinking, that light isn't moving correctly for an airplane, or it looks too big.  If I remember correctly most were yellow light, or perhaps white.  Somewhere in the early or mid nineties, I saw the most incredible sights at Waimanalo beach in eastern Oahu.  These may well all be natural.  I just thought they were spectacular.  On this particular day, I saw an awesome rainbow coming straight down from a cloud to the sea.  About sunset, which was taking place on the other side of a mountain range, a sight appeared in the eastern sky about where the sun rises.  This on the horizon was over the water.  Black rays emanated from this spot, like a reverse sunset.  Lots of people saw it, they just looked transfixed, but no one said anything, strangely. Combined with the rainbow and something else I've forgotten, the energy was intense that day.  It was special.  I would be grateful to know what that was, if anyone knows.  Then, between about 2000 and 2002, I saw one more thing.  I was near Punchbowl.  It was probably between about 3 and 5 in the afternoon.  This cloud came overhead, but it was not like any cloud I have ever seen.  It seemed unusually radiant and important.  It resembled a city in the sky.  I was transfixed by it.  I remember I wanted to call an aquaintance who is spiritually sensitive and religious because I thought she too would understand that something was afoot.  I don't think that was an ordinary cloud.  I've wondered in it concealed a UFO, or something else.  That's all I can specifically remember at this time.  I've noticed other reports on this site of strange lights over the ocean outside of Waikiki that are like my stories.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223

Looking South from the Halekulani Hotel on Wikiki beach, 6th floor. I had arrived earlier that day with my wife, and had NOT been drinking.  The hotel balcony is only about 300 feet from the ocean.  I first noticed a disk shaped object hovering what appeared to be 30-40 feet above the beach.  At first I thought this was a seagull sized bird flying in place against the ocean breeze.  This seemed unlikely, since it was 11:15pm and the wind was barely blowing.  My next thought was that this faintly outlined disk shaped object could be a kite.  The object was bobbing and moving like a kite would from my vantage point.  5 seconds later this object moved to my right about 10 degrees behind a palm tree and shortly thereafter re-appeared to the right of the tree.  This convinced me that this was not a kite since the object moved too fast and started to ascend slightly.  The object continued moving in a slightly ascending trajectory to the West (my right)  This movement covered roughly an additional 20 degrees.  Somewhere near this phase of the sighting, the object emmitted a dim red/orange continuous glow, and that's what I tracked for the remainder of the sighting.  As the object moved across the sky to the right, it suddenly reversed directions and started moving East in a relatively straight line. Now I knew that this was like nothing I had ever seen in my life.  The object then moved in a counter clockwise circular motion, followed by another pass from left to right. Finally the dim light stopped for a few seconds and then went straight up and slightly to my right.  After this point, the light became dimmer and dimmer in the black moonless sky.  I called my wife out to see, but she could not pick up the very faint light at this point, roughly 45 degrees off the horizon.  This episode lasted 30-45 seconds.  The next morning I repositioned myself on the balcony in order to guesstimate how far away this object was.  Clearly, the object. depending on it's size, was between 1/8 and 1/4 mile away at the early stages of the sighting. (Well below the horizon) This would make the object size about 20-30 feet across.  I am college educated, and I know what airplanes, helecopters, sattelites, and shooting stars all look like in the night sky.  I did not hear anything my encounter was only visual.  All these signs tell me that this object was definitely out of this world.  Needless so say, I could not fall asleep for several hours.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
Star-sized object shines brightly then disappears after making 30 degree angle turn;2002-08-22 20:08:00;approx. 1:00 minute;Star-sized object shines brightly then disappears after making 30 degree angle turn My wife, 5 year-old daughter and I were outside of our garage, putting something in the back of our car.  I happened to look up, as I often do to check for UFO's, and noticed a small dot of light about the size of the surrounding stars (a pinhead at arm's length)moving from West to East.  It covered the length of a ruler at arm's length in about 8 seconds.  I told my wife, Wow, what the heck is that?.  She said, It's probably an airplane.  However, there were no blinking lights on it and, from it's very small size, near to the size of the planet Mars, I was more than certain it was very high up.  As we watched it I suddenly said, Look!  It just got brighter!  As it moved along in a straight path its diameter increased, it glowed more brightly, from a pinhead size to almost the size of a pea at arm's length.  This lasted for about 2 to 3 seconds. (At this point, I had very quickly run into the house and grabbed my binoculars.  When I saw it through my binoculars it had a fuzzy appearance to it and it seemed to have white dots around its perimeter.  I was using a Bushnell 10X50 to view the object).  I then wondered if it had been reflecting light from the sun or if it had actually glowed internally.  Then something amazing happened.  It dimmed to almost nothing. It was now barely visible, and there were no clouds along the entire flight path of this object.  Finally, this is the amazing part, it made a 30 degree (from the horizon) turn to the right and then disappeared, the whole time travelling at the same rate of speed.  It's color had first been a pale white and had glowed to a very intense white when it's diameter increased and then had returned to a very dim pale white before it made its turn and disappeared.  It's travel path, again, was from West to East and travelling down toward the horizon at almost a 45 degree angle.  By the way, my wife also viewed it through the binoculars and said it had a jumpy movement right before it disappeared, AFTER its 30 degree angle turn.  I asked her if the ! jumpy mo vement had been from her hands shaking the binoculars, but she said that it had not, as she had both the object and a stationary star in her field of view at the same time.  I just couldn't believe what we had seen!!  It was my very first UFO sighting in Hawaii!!  I was very certain it wasn't a satellite, as satellites don't make turns.  It was not a meteor they don't turn either and it was definitely not a CONVENTIONAL aircraft.  It may have been military but, again, from its diminutive size I was very certain this object was WAY UP there in space… ((NUFORC Note:  No Iridium satellite flashes are indicated by www.heavens-above.com satellite for Honolulu for this date and time.

zig zagging light, floating oval object, and large dark colored object seen above park in honolulu.;2005-05-20 20:00:00;@20 minutes or so,;zig zagging light, floating oval object, and large dark colored object seen above park in honolulu. It had just gotten dark outside and I was running/jogging in Ala Moana park when i first noticed hearing fighter jets flying around above the park, but way up in the sky, not flying low, that caused me to look up and to see a white light zipping around in a sporatic pattern (this light was flying south/east of the honolulu airport), then i saw the light do like a spiral move upwards then it came down, straightened itself out and then the light went out, the fighter jets left soon after that and i didnt notice them any longer. I did think it was strange that jets were out flying at that time of night. Then I saw further in the sky, towards the west something floating down like the way a feather would float down and it was in the shape of an oval or a pringles potato chip ( i know that sounds strange, but thats what it looked like to me) and it was coming down really slowly, going back and forth as it came down and as I tried to study it more closely and focus on it, it appeared to have some kind of a pattern on it, to me it looked like some kind of flower and it was white background and the flower looking thing was either lights  or some other kind of shiny material, I couldn't tell.  Then it went too low and I lost sight of it because it went below the trees.  It must have came down somewhere out over the ocean is all I could of where it went.  When I got past the trees finally and could see the ocean I didnt see anything out there, besides it was dark outside, too, and I didnt see any kind of lights out on the ocean in the direction I thought the object must have gone down.  Then as I was standing there at the end of the park looking out at the ocean a object about the size of a helicopter, maybe bigger I couldnt tell cause the object was so well blended into the night sky, this object flew right over the tree tops in the park, and I mean right above them, it made no sound at all, the only reason why I noticed it was the fact that I had been looking up at the sky to see if there was anything else.   This object had a couple of little red lights on the bottom of it which also caught my eye.  It was flying over the park heading out over the ocean in the direction that I thought the other object must have gone down.  No one else, as far as I could tell had seen anything that I had just seen.  I couldn't believe other people could be so blind and just so oblivious as to all the stuff I had just seen.  I hope someone else saw the same stuff.  Then I went to my car and left. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223

Just to let you guys know this is not the only flying craft I have captured on this camera I have 3 or 4 other fascinating images taken here on Oahu.  I was born and raised here in Hawaii lived on 3 different Islands etc.  So I think I’m qualified.   Ok nuff of the BS, here is my story, on the way home I started to shoot images out of my passenger side window which was all the way down.  The mountain you see in the background is the tallest mountain on this island elevation around 4,500 ft.  It is on the boarder on the biggest military base on this island. Schofield Barracks.  I believe there is a base inside of that mountain on that base.  I know I’m not crazy, I’m 46 years old been married for 24 years! 3 beautiful children.  I don’t want any fame or money for this. Just dig, dig until you find the reason behind it. I know it is not of this earth.   Aloha, F. Enclosed you will have pics.

Orange light over Hawaii Kai, Honolulu;2008-05-26 00:00:00;1 minute;Orange light over Hawaii Kai, Honolulu Driving east on Lunalilo Home Rd. in Hawaii Kai, Honolulu, I noticed a bright orange light in the sky over Kamehame ridge and Koko Head Crater. It was the same hue of orange as the sodium vapor street lights used in Honolulu, but larger, and much brighter. I thought maybe it was a reflection of the street lights, but after changing my viewing angle in the car several times I confirmed it was not a reflection. It was much higher than the ridge, so it was not a street light. My girlfriend was in the passenger seat, and asked what I was looking at. I said, that orange light in the sky. And she replied, oh the one that just split into two?  Indeed, it had split into two. They seemed to be hovering. I couldn't judge the size of the lights, since I couldn't determine how close or far they were. They then merged back into one. The light blinked on and off several times, then disappeared altogether. There were no clouds in the sky at the time, and winds were calm.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223

What i saw was a U.S Army Blackhawk chasing a ball of light that flew in a pattern that no aircraft i know of could fly in at speeds that no other craft i know of could match. sometimes it would go fast, then it would slow down so the copter could get closer, then it would shoot out again. Later that night i heard jet engines flying over Honolulu for about 2 hours, they have a distinct sound to them.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
Bright green light with extreme speed flight pattern over ocean beyond Waikiki, Island of Oahu, 12/06/09;2009-12-06 19:30:00;0.05;Bright green light with extreme speed flight pattern over ocean beyond Waikiki, Island of Oahu, 12/06/09 From a vantage point on a hillside facing the ocean beyond Waikiki on a clear starry night, I spotted a bright flash of green light at about the same altitude as my line of sight. The location was over the ocean, some distance offshore of what would be considered as the Diamondhead or Waikiki/Honolulu area of Oahu. The green light flashed once, then streaked several miles to the left in a split second, flashed brightly once more, then went dark momentarily and flashed dimly once more before disappearing. I watched the area for 5 more minutes but didn't see another occurrence. Commercial aircraft are always passing through the same airspace as this sighting, and as I watched the area after this sighting there were a number of commercial flights moving slowly across the sky with their characteristic small flashing white lights. The speed, color and movement pattern of man-made craft and UFOs are entirely different and as a former flight student, I would never possibly confuse the two. I have seen the same thing before, from the other side of the island of Oahu, over Kaneohe Bay about 10 years ago. On that occasion there were two of us watching, and we saw the same thing and still talk about it. The green light and flight pattern for that older sighting were much the same as this sighting on 12/06/09, further validating these experiences for me. I checked the local news the next day and found no reports of sightings, but I find it hard to believe that I was the only witness.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223

White and blue color. Pulsating light was white. Lasted for five minutes.  I saw it do two fly by circles around the crater hill where we walk up.  Fast moving, I could hear the air turbulence but not an engine sound.  Low level, not airplane.  Heliocopter like size with no rotors, no jet engine.  Moved really fast and low 300 ft. above sea level.  Didn't come around again after 2nd turn.  Early surfers saw it too. Military?

The light was trailing east towards diamond head. It looked like it was heading towards us and I called out to my friend to look at what i was looking at.   Once we both were looking at it, it came to a stop and just hovered.  it would jump from moving east to hover to moving east again.   When it started to move east we noticed another light of the same color but dimmer.  That second light never moved and just hovered.  The second light dimmed out to nothing and the first light eventually started to dim out too.  The light of the first one was very intense and strong enough to produce strong rays to my eyes!

On December 17&18 several of us here in Hawaii watched a strange light hovering above diamondhead just to the East at about 50 degreesffthe ocean. This light has appeared for the last 2 nights at 6:30 and ending around 7:48 pm.Last night the light was first noticed around 6:30 pm. The light grew brighter as the sky darkened and eventually started pulsating to every color inthe rainbow every  2 seconds then turning dark yellow with this red stuff seemingly dripping from the bottom.Then it began to fade and abruptly disappeared at 7:48pm. That was nothing compared to what happened tonight. The light promptly appeared at 6:30 pm slightly higher than where it was last night.As the sun  went down the light began to grow very bright with these pointed rays coming out of it looking like a star that goes on top of a christmas tree.  This light was lighting up the night sky.  The light began moving west toward ala  Moana then disappearing far out to sea off Barber's Point a! t again 7:48 pm.I am absolutely sure the same phenomena wil occur again tomorrow at 6:30 pm ending at precisely 6:30 pm ending at 7:48 pm.Watch the sky-It WILL happen tomorrow.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223

A light appeared within a stationary cloud, finally going out and the cloud dissipated rapidly.;2012-04-11 23:00:00;5 minutes;A light appeared within a stationary cloud, finally going out and the cloud dissipated rapidly. I have two floor-to-ceiling windows in the bedroom that I keep the curtains pulled backto enjoy the city-scape lights a night. Looking out the window while sitting in the bed about 11PM, I saw a little cloud about 1/2 - 1 mile away.  It appeared to be shaped like the state of Virginia.... With the Spring winds blowing from the Northeast, oddly it was completly still about 100 - 200 ft higher than I am on the 30th floor. It was located just South of Punchbowl crater, out over the city.  After I noticed it wasn't moving in the winds, I began to study its shape from the reflected light of the city streets below......then a light appeared in the cloud, like you see when an airplane is letting down thru clouds at night with the landing light on.  First the light was fuzzy inside the cloud then, the light became a bright peachy-orange color... like it broke out of the cloud... I was trying to adjust my eyes to make sure it really wasn't a plane…  The light became! clear and brighter, in a full circle/ball shape, about center of the cloud. It was a stable light, not flickering like a burning flare appears.  Then the round light went back into the cloud with about half the round shape visible/hanging out of bottom of the cloud, bright on the bottom and diffused in the cloud.  Suddenly the light just went out.  From the lights of the city, the little cloud was still visible with a black, perfectly round hole in it.  The little cloud didn't just drift off, it quickly faded away without moving.... odd, considering the strong, gusty wind that night. I wish I had taken a picture/video, but I was fixed on the activity!!!;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
Orange/white light appears in sky over Waikiki moving erratically at very high altitude, stationary stars in background.;2012-09-12 23:38:00;5 minutes til cloud cover;Orange/white light appears in sky over Waikiki moving erratically at very high altitude, stationary stars in background. Sitting on balcony 26 floors up at Rainbow Tower, Hilton Hawaiian Village, gazing at the last few planes departing Hawaii, and looking up at stars.  Saw object that seemed very high up moving across sky.  Immediately assumed it was a satelite due to its seemingly unusually high altitude.  Then it started to jump around sporadically in all directions.  I watched for about a minute or two, then quickly went in hotel room to grab my camera.   After fully zooming, it took me about 20 seconds to get object in field of view, and when i did I recorded this movement for about 2 1/2 minjutes or so.  I yelled at my wife who was sleeping and told her to get up as I beleive I was seeing a UFO.  Just after she got to balcony significant cloud cover interfered with real time viewing.   I proceeded to download video onto my computer, and after several viewings I started to look for anything else in background that might be stationary, and fortunately located three stars that are much further away, of course, and they remain relatively stationary in video whikle thius object moves all over the screen, proving that the movement was not the resuklt of cmaera shake.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223

I noticed one start flying from out of nowhere, it began flying in a straight line which is what made me think it was a shooting star, but then it started zig-zagging from left to right before it disappeared.  It was only a small orange dot in the sky but it was flying faster than any plane I've ever seen.   A few nights later I downloaded the sky map app from the android app store to see which way they were going, if the planets don't change position a lot over a few days then that means they were headed to neptune.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
Blue and Red lights flying erratically in the air over Tantalus.;2014-10-05 00:25:00;20 minutes;Blue and Red lights flying erratically in the air over Tantalus I'm a Security Officer, and have been working Security for 6 years now. It happened while I was on duty and preparing to do my last patrol of the shift before ending. At approximately 0025hrs(12:25am), I observed a blue and red light flying over the Ko'olau Mountains near Tantalus/roundtop drive.  My first thought was that it was a plane coming over the mountain, but I quickly ruled that out when it changed course, moving slightly to my left.  It was much to sudden to be a plane, so the next thing I thought was a helicopter, which was quickly ruled out soon after when I observed the lights make a sudden change and begun to fly in a zig zagging kind of path in the sky, and not to mention that there was no sound of helicopter blades chopping through the air at all. Upon that sudden course of action it conducted I was most certainly interested now.  I continued to monitor the lights and even repositioned myself on the property to try to get a better view and continue to observe it's strange and erratic movements.  It then proceeded to appear to descend towards the ground where I could no longer observe as my vision was obstructed by trees and structures.  It's movements were like someone pointing a laser pointer and moving it all over the place except much more controlled and not as fast, but faster and able to do things that a plane or helicopter could do. Shortly there after it's descent out of my view, my Supervisor shows up at my site to check up on me as usual during my shift, and almost soon after he arrived the thing shot back into the air and proceeded to fly erratically as before, I quickly pointed it out and even he was baffled by it and we both continued to watch it until it descended again to the ground where we couldn't see.  My Supervisor is a former U.S. Marine and he said he had never seen any aircraft do things like that, not even a remote controlled device. I know what I was thinking when we watched it, but I waited to hear him say it first. I think we just observed an Unidentified Flying Object.  We ruled out cars that might have been on the road on the mountain as we both saw the object fly high enough that we could see there was space between the outline of the mountain and the lights, so it was definitely in the air. We saw it shoot straight up suddenly and we thought it was gonna zip away, but it hovered for about 5 seconds before shooting back down towards the ground where we couldn't see it.  And that was the last we saw it. Immediately after my shift at 0100hrs I got in my car and drove up to the Military Cemetary at Punch bowl to try to get a better view. Once up there I saw a group of 4 young people hanging out overlooking the area where my workplace is and so I asked them if they saw it, if they saw the lights. One of them, a girl, admitted to seeing a red light shoot up from the corner of her eye not long before I arrived.  And that was the last time I saw it, I waited for about 15 minutes more to see if it would return, but it didn't.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
In Waikiki, two separate bright green lights 100 feet off ground, moving at great speed toward ground.;2014-11-07 21:00:00;6-8 seconds;In Waikiki, two separate bright green lights 100 feet off ground, moving at great speed toward ground. Walking toward Waikiki Beach from Kuhio on Seaside, a friend and I observed two bright green lights moving sharply toward the ground.  Their movement made it evident that they were unconnected.  The lights looked to be individual craft, moving at a decreasing angle 100 feet over the ground, with great speed.  They were about 200 yards from us, and disappeared behind a building.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223

The lig;2014-11-20 17:00:00;2 hours;There is a bright white lighted object flying erratically above the Koko head shooting range. I filmed over an hour of footage.  The light dims and brightens and moves horizontally and vertically. It's still there doing the same thing as of 21:00.  It appears to dive toward the ground, then it shoots up in the sky, stalls and moves left to right and in a circular motion.  As if someone is drawing a circle with a flashlight.  I also filmed at least 7 airplanes flying past it within an hours time.  Note that the video does not give good details of the craft, however, you can clearly see the erratic pattern it is flying in.  And you can see the airplanes flying past it (you can tell the planes apart from the craft because of their flight path and strobing light, the object is just flying in all directions).  It almost appears as if someone is flying a kite with a set of lights on it.  The only problem is that flies way to high to be a kit.  It is higher than the airpl! anes flying past it, and it dives down a rockets back to high altitude way too quickly to be a kite.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223

White light moving very fast makes right angle turn.;2016-07-03 21:18:00;3-4 seconds;White light moving very fast makes right angle turn. My wife and I were on the beach at the Disney Aulani resort.  I was looking at the stars via Google star maps, when I saw a white light moving very fast from south to west, just below Jupiter.   There was no tail or trail and after a few seconds it made a 90 degree turn at very high speed and then disappeared.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
Red lights, flying away, stopping, hovering and flying backwards;2016-10-23 18:30:00;1-2 minutes;red lights, flying away, stopping, hovering and flying backwards Series of red lights, flying towards the ocean at a high speed.  They then stop and hover for a few seconds. start to fly backwards slowly, then in a circle, then hover and the ascend, stop and fly back behind a tree that blocks my vision.   After a few seconds, the lights appear again.  Fly forward a little, stop and hover, fly around and then fly behind the tree that blocks my vision.   No sound and movement too quick to be a helicopter.  Definitely not a plane.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223

A bright light seemed to appear out of nowhere off the coast of Hawaii Kai on Oahu.  ((anonymous report));2019-01-07 14:39:00;8 minutes;A bright light seemed to appear out of nowhere off the coast of Hawaii Kai on Oahu while I was running around Diamond Head Crater.  The object appeared to be round and fluctuated in brightness and color. It turned from white to a pink-ish color just before it moved horizontally across the sky and disappeared from view. In the video I took, it also appears to fluctuate in size and at one point, there appears to be two objects right next to each other or touching.  It’s hard to tell if that is just because of the poor video quality on my phone or not. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I looked up at the sky and saw round white lights going over the mountain range in a straight line.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-02-05 18:05:00;45 seconds;At approximately 6:03 a.m. this morning I walked out into the driveway to put the trash receptacle by the street for pick up.  It was still dark out.  I looked up at the sky and saw round white lights going over the mountain range in a straight line with a space in between each light.  I noticed the two of the white lights were very close together but the rest were spaced out evenly.  I started to count how many I saw as I called for a witness to come out of the house and view this with me.  I counted approximately 25 of them.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
