Green glowing UFOs and some that look like stars in the shape of circles with many encounters.;2002-06-30 22:00:00;Years;Green glowing UFOs and some that look like stars in the shape of circles with many encounters. The first encounter was with two friends I no longer have contact with.  It was probably about 5-6 years ago around 10:00p.m.  We we're skateboarding behind the gym of an elementary school and decided to take a rest.  We lodged our skateboards into these vents against the gym wall and layed back on them.  We had a clear view of the sky that night and I noticed a green star in the sky.  It was bright and very distinguishable amongst all the other stars in the sky.  I pointed it out to my two friends and they noticed it right away.  We layed back and watched it for about 10 seconds when all of a sudden it came down right in front of our faces, all the way from high up in the sky right down in front of us in a split second.  The object was emitting a green glow that was very bright, but I didn't notice anything else light up around us.  It was completely silent making no sound at all, and this object was big.  My friends and I made no sound and just stared at it.  I just couldn't believe what I was seeing.  It probably hovered in front of us for around 10 seconds, as if it were staring back at us.  Afterwards it shot off back into space as fast as it had come down in front of us and we lost sight of it a second after it shot directly back up into the atmosphere.  Afterwards my friends stood up screaming their heads off and running.  I didn't know what to do or think so I just followed them.  Years and years later my friends and I were just discussing UFO encounters.  This wasn't my first either, but it is the most significant as it leads to a chain of sightings.  So anyways, I told them about this one and they realized that we could try and head to the school gym to try and see if we could spot them again.  I thought it was a great idea and got excited, so we left.  At the gym we waited for a while, and sure enough my friend spotted one out of the corner of his eye.  It looked like a star, but it was movinhg, and then a few more started popping up and moving around in the sky.  They looked ! like sta rs, however some would fly low and close to the mountain next to us and these were green leaving green trails behind them.  These would move fast and then slowly, and then all of a sudden they would jet accross the sky leaving trails behind them.  We could spot up to even 6 at a time easily.  Some were straight above us, some were off in the distance.  We watched these from around 12:00 midnight until 5:00-6:00a.m.  after the sun comes up we could no longer see them.  I gathered more friends over time and we would make routine visits to the gym to spot more UFOs.  Sometimes we would see a lot, sometimes none at all.  One time one flew close to us, we could just tell it was close, especially by lining it up with the mountain next to us.  This one flew slow and was about the size of a quarter if you were to hold one at an arm's length in front of your face.  It flew from above our heads, all the way to the other side of the field and eventually passed the mountains and dissapeared behind some clouds.  There is no way these objects could be aircraft, it's impossible.  Nothing can move that slowly and then speed up that fast and maneuver they way they did.  Sometimes they would fly directly at each other as if they were going to collide and move away right before they would touch, and move at extreme speeds.  These were still flying around, the last time I checked about a year ago.  Sometimes I could see them from my apartment balcony, like one would just jet down really fast and dissapear.  I mainly only saw them at the school gym though.  I would love to have people investigate this.  I want this to go places and I was watching the National Geographic channel and heard about this place on a UFO show that they had on.  Please, check this out!  Oh yeah I forgot to mention that we brought video cameras afterwards to try and videotape some of these UFOs.  We were unable to capture any of them with our camera because the sky was just black and the video camera was horrible at picking anything up in that type of! setting Another thing is that the video cameras shut off at the same time while we were trying to record.  The batteries weren't drained or anything, but for some reason the cameras just shut off completely. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

At this angle I could see that there were more objects behind it at higher altitudes, one group of spheres formed a triangle. At this point I could count nine white spheres each being higher than the other except for the group of three that formed the triangle (they seemed to be at the same altitude). The object that cought my eye to begin with, the one closest to the ground seemed to be spinning. These objects maintained there formation and just drifted west at about the same pace as the clouds. The skys were mostly clear with some clouds and a light breeze.       After I thought it was all over more would appear, at one point an airplane flew near one, I wondered if the crew saw the object. As we were leaving two more objects drifted over head and another behind them, again from the skys over diamond head crater.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
Colorful U.F.O. spotted near Hawaii International Airport;2009-08-15 20:37:00;3 minutes;Colorful U.F.O. spotted near Hawaii International Airport I work as a Security Officer and have never seen a U.F.O. before.   What I saw was a circular object in the sky approximately 200-250 feet above me.  There were strobe lights on the object.  The colors changed from red, green, yellow, purple, orange, blue.  There was a reddish colored ball hanging from the object.  It was traveling roughly 80-90 miles per hour heading west near Honolulu International Airport, and as you can tell from my description of the colors that were shown in the U.F.O.  This was not an aircraft.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
Unusually bright, very colorful pulsating light in the sky,;2009-10-14 02:20:00;5 Minute;Unusually bright, very colorful pulsating light in the sky, We live on the 27th floor of a highrise condominium building.  From my lanai (balcony), I saw an unusually bright, very colorful pulsating light (noticeably brighter than the brightest star or planet in the normal night sky) above the horizon and between two buildings.  I rushed for my Sanyo Xacti Full HD camera and started handheld filming the object.  I noticed the object had moved to the west (right) slowly but rapidly enough to notice.  Then the object slowed down again and continued on a westerly (right) path. I filmed until the object went behind the building.  I proceeded to get on my motorbike and drove to the park where I knew I would be able to have an unobstructed view of the sky but I could not find the object again.  I checked my  astronomy program and determined that the light could not have been Jupiter as it was already below the horizon at the time I was recording.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
REALLY FAST GREEN CIRCULAR LIGHT IN THE SKY.;2012-11-23 21:00:00;5 seconds;REALLY FAST GREEN CIRCULAR LIGHT IN THE SKY   Green orb moving really fast in the sky east to southwest Saw it from the Ala Moana parking lot as I was getting into my car. Disappeared behind a building, so I only saw it really quick. But, I saw it long enough to know that it was too big and too fast to be a plane. Looked pretty high up but still, it was huge.  It was BRIGHT green and moving in a straight line.  No flashes, just one steady light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

We thought it was Venus so we took pictures. As it started getting brighter as if coming towards us. That is when we realized it was flying and not a planet.  It then started to horseshoe back towards the moon. It kept going on that   trajectory as if headed behind the moon.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223

No aircraft were spotted in the sky prior to he photo. I was taking a photo of the building on the left of me.  I took my time setting up the focus on my phone camera to snap the photo of the sky and the building.  There were no aircraft in the air at the time and I believe where the craft is at in the photo is not an actual or normal flight path for aircraft.  Immediately after taking the photo I noticed the object and looked for it in the sky, which I did not see it.;21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
