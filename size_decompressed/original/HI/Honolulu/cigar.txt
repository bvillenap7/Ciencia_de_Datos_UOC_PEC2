My daughter & I had errans to run that day so we jumped into our Jeep (I had the roof off fully open) as we got to the traffic light a mile from our home, I looked left out to the ocean and noticed the craziest thing, I saw what I call contrails in this instance, not chemtrails.  The trail were in the weireds shapes in the sky, I estimate the 2 craft making the contrails were traveling over mach 3 or faster.  Whe I zoomed in on my compter you cant see the “Jets” in front of the contrail, explain that one? The when I was analyzing one of the photographs I noticed a black cylindracal craft hovering very high above a cumulus cloud that craft could move at the speed of light, in the blink of an eye it would be 10 miles away! I seemed to be observing what was going on, then I spot a domed disc very high above what was happening.  Here is thekicker, before I bought this expensive slr digital nikon 10.75 megapixel, I have b een getting photos of crafts in myneighborhood almost weekly. I was  writing to try to get in touch with the lady from Kaneohe, Hi, who had been going through the same thing for some time. I would like to meet wit h her or talk on the phone first. She reported out of Hawaii on 3/4/08 she left no email or phone and she is looking for partners who are experiencing the same things.   Sincerely, ((name and e-address deleted))  give this to her!   Aloha,  F ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));21.3170010650657;-157.842313865223
See above.  ((NUFORC Note:  The photos of interest show tiny, blurry objects.  We suspect they are birds in flight.  PD));2014-01-19 17:05:00;10 seconds or less;See above. The object was caught on my camera while taking pictures of a rainbow off the eastern end of Oahu, Hawaii at exactly 17:05:54 on Sunday, 1/19/14.  The camera used is a Sony NEX6 16mp with a 50mm lens that has a crop factor of 1.5X.  Thus the lens is really 75mm. I shot the picture with an apeture of f8. Below are highlights of my observation:   1.  A previous shot taken at 17:05:50 does not have the object neither does a shot right after at 17:06:01...so it appears the object covered almost 3/4 through the view in 4 seconds or less and disappeared from the view in 7 seconds or less. 2.  The object in sight seems to be much larger than the boat shown in the picture to bottom left of the rainbow. 3.  I did not hear any loud jet/helicopter sound, noise nor see it while taking pictures. I only noticed afterward while reviewing the pictures that night (last night). 4.  I took the shots on the ridge above the famous Hanauma Bay, Oahu Hawaii. The area on Google Map is Portlock Hawaii. 5.  Distance from where I took the shot to the rainbow my guess is perhaps around 2-4 miles away. Pictures to follow...
