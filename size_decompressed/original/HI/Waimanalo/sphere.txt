Orange/yellow (mostly orange) spheres popping out of the sky direction of Waimanalo Beach Park, Hawaii;2014-12-31 00:00:00;5+ minutes;Orange/yellow (mostly orange) spheres popping out of the sky direction of Waimanalo Beach Park, Hawaii On 12/31/14 at 12 midnight, I was watching the fireworks from my apartment and noticed that an orange/yellow (mostly orange) sphere appeared in the direction of Waimanalo Beach Park.  These popped into the sky like bubbles coming out of boiling water.  I counted six.  One was far inland over the homestead area where I live. The fireworks were so beautiful.  Figured they must have come to watch too.  So after that I did not pay attention to them and I watched the fireworks instead.;21.3423;-157.7141
