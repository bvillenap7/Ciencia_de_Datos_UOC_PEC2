I can't belive i'm seeing this in hawaii.;2011-07-04 22:00:00;west;I can't belive i'm seeing this in hawaii. It came from the west side of oahu.It looked like a star at first,and then as it got closer the bright light dimmed.  I saw a triangle shape craft with three red lights on the top of the triange.  On the lower left there was one florecent green light, as it got closer..  The lights changed its location, and the three red lights that was on the top of the triangle was now on the lower right.  Then as it came even closer like fifty feet away from my balecony wich is on the eight floor.  As clear as day, I saw a space craft of none human nature.   The fluorescent green light was like a lazer,on top of the craft.   It was small in size the bottom of the triangle was five feet wide and it had a shinny black layer over the whole craft.  The engine was soft but sounded like it had alot of power.  It moved very slow and even hovered for about five to seven minutes.   I watched it until it past my building.;21.4000999999999;-158.016
