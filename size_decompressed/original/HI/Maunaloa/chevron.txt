Never before seen Red Lights;2000-09-25 20:12:00;2 minutes;Never before seen Red Lights I, along with my son, my brother and 2 friends were standing on my veranda last night adoring the night sky. We are located on the west side of the island of Molokai in the Hawaiian chain as we stood there looking at the stars and the sky, at a southwest direction in the sky we saw what we assumed at first was a airplane then we noticed there were to many lights to be a airplane.  It looked like it was bobbing left to right then there was a solid roll of lights that started with only one light then followed by one on each side then a multitude of resddish lights began to flash on and off in a pattern.  The pattern was, it would start at the center light then flash out quickly and continue to flash in this manner.  The object seemed to be rolling ( like an airplane would).  But there was too many lights to be a airplane and as a frequent observer of airplanes I know it was not a airplane and it was not in a normal area or flight pattern in which airplanes would fly over this island.  If you would like to know more about this event you can contact me by email Thank you;21.1422;-157.2193
