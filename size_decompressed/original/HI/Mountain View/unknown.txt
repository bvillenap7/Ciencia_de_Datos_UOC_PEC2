One  cra My husband and I observed 2  craft in what seemed to be a training exercise between Mountain View and Kona Hawaii.  One  craft seemed to be  playing  with another craft by stopping and reversing and passing and then completely stopping in midair and then zooming past the other craft as if  playing  with it.  Could not judge distance....but when my husband and I stared at them...they stopped suddenly and started coming towards us. We freaked out and ran!  We could feel that they knew we were on to them!  We felt threatened. It's fuzzy as to how we disconnected...  Never saw shape or size of craft.  Just that it looked liked two planes in a dogfight.  They looked like fighter jets. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));19.5498;-155.0882
