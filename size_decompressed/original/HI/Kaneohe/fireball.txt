A red ball of light with a hint of yellow at the top moved across the sky for about 90 seconds until it disappeared into the clouds.  It was below the cloud coverage. There is no wind tonight, so it is very quiet and this object appeared to be silent.  It changed in size, therefore it must have been changing altitude.  It was larger as it came from the east off the pacific ocean and became smaller as it approached the Ko'olau Mountain range and moved south.
