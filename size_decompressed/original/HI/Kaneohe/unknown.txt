Observed a very bright and sparkley lit object above the mountain ridge. Thought it was a plane, but it never moved for 20 minutes. Last 10 minutes, it slowly dropped below the mountain ridge. It was an array of colored lights... and I compared it to the other stars in the sky. This was not a star. It would have been more visible in Honolulu since I live on the other side of the mountain. My neighbor said she saw it zigzag before we lost it.;21.4254000000001;-157.813800000002
