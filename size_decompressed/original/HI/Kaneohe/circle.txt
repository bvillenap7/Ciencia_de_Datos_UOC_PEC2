While fishing on the Kaneohe Marine Base Pier, I was lying down looking at the stars, 2 objects, round in shape, made its way from the South moving at a high speed that looked like planets.  They were moving in the direction towards the North East as I was following it for about 2 minutes until the clouds blocked the view.  They were definitely not stars nor meteors.;21.4254000000001;-157.813800000002
