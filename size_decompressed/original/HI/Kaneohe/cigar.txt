Suddenly just over the tree tops along Kaneohe Bay we witnessed a long, cigar-shaped, craft without wings, so large, moving so slowly it defied gravity.  It had lights along its perimeter.   As we walked further toward sea level, we lost our height advantage and lost sight of it as it moved slowly north.  It was overwhelming, I was in shock, and wondered what I would do when I returned home, who to call?  I decided I would probably deemed crazy, so I did not report it.   Two days later there was an account in the Honolulu Advertiser newspaper of a UFO sighting, witnessed by a dozen or more people on the other side of the island, over the central mountains, the Leeward side.;21.4254000000001;-157.813800000002
A large, dark cigar shaped craft w/ lights;1986-12-31 18:00:00;00:05;A large, dark cigar shaped craft w/ lights My son and I were returning home from an evening walk when we saw a very large UFO moving very slowly just above the tree line along a small mountain ridge at Temple Valley on the Windward side of Oahu. It was in the early evening & it was just light enough to see it we had climbed the ridge before & found an old WWII lookout bunker up there on the other side is a rural coastal road & a bay it was a dark shade of no color,quiet, w/lights around its perimeter seemingly defying gravity I did not report it in fear of being labelled a kook however, the next day sightings were reported on the other side of the island on TV news. We lived there for 20 years & that was the only time I heard of actual sighting. I now believe in ufo's, although I suppose our military could have been testing something new, but is was definitely not a plane from our view it looked like a giant cigar in the sky.
