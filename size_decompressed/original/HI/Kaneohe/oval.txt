Object was moving slowly, then stayed still, clearly visible. It was seemed less than a mile up in the sky.  Oval shaped, bright red on left and right with a flickering yellow flame-like light in the middle. I thought it was a hot air balloon, but the flame was in the middle, not below the object. I went to get my son to see it, but could not find him, so I grabbed my camera, but by then the object was too far to see in the camera and then disappeared into a distant cloud.;21.4254000000001;-157.813800000002
