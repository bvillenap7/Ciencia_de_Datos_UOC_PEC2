We were driving out of the Likelike tunnel on the Kaneohe side of the island and as we were coming down the mountain, a bright glowing lime green shaped sphere was passing over and above us. It was about the size of a Volkswagon bug, and it was approximately 100-200 yards above us. It didn't streak past us, but it did seem to be moving fast.  Then it just went out, like someone turned the light on it out.  I'm pretty sure that other motorists must have also seen this.  It was hard to miss.;21.4254000000001;-157.813800000002
