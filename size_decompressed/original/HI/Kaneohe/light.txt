PD));2007-05-05 20:25:00;15 min.;Large, bright, non-twinkling, stationary light we thought was a planet was completely gone 15 minutes later Partner came in and told me there was something strange in the sky that he wanted me to see.  There was a very large and bright light in the northern sky--at least twice as large and bright as a normal star.  It did not twinkle like a star or move like a satellite, so we assumed it must be a planet.   We went inside to research online if there were any bright planets to be seen that night.  We went out about fifteen minutes later to look at it again and it was completely gone.   We are both highly-educated health care professionals, male and female. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been observing Venus, which would have been in the WNW sky, and which might have been obscured by high clouds.  Just a guess.
