Large pinkish orb just beneath the Full Moon;2017-08-07 20:49:00;60 seconds;Large pinkish Orb just beneath the Full Moon On August 7, 2017, at 8:49 PM, I was driving in Kapaa, Kauai.  The full Moon was out and I saw a very large bright white light nearby it.   I pulled over to snap a pic of the full Moon, but the bright object was not in sight when I snapped it.  However, when I checked the pic the next day, there was a HUGE pinkish orb just beneath the Full Moon.   I have no doubt it is a Galactic Craft.
