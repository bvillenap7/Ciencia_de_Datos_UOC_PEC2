It was a normal night and i was crossing my porch to go to my room when I noticed a group of small lights following each other in arrays.They were white with a bit of purple but they couldnt have been airplanes because they werent flashing,unless they were milatary. They were in a southern direction passing fairly low about 5000ft between Mt. waialeale and the sleeping giant. I told my mother to come and see and she looked and thought it was odd. She didnt have much to say. The lights were at an angle and looked like they were gaining altitude but in a very even way like if connected by some magnetic force. They then flew past the sleeping giant and for 15 seconds i couldnt see them so i ran around the porch to the east of my house and i faintly saw them because of lihue and kapaas city light. Now they looked like if they were at about 20,000 ft. They just headed higher and higher eastbound over the ocean until they dissapeared. I didnt mention it for a while but a year later my freind said he saw a group of lights passing eastbound from his house which is about 8 miles north of mine. He described them the same way traveling in an array. I hope you can tell me what they were I am very interested.;22.0899;-159.3482
