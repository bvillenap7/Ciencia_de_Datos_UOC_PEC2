Saw a galactic craft on my way down the mountain enroute to Lihue from Wailua Homesteads.  After you pass Opaekaa Falls, there's an expansive view of the ocean out to the horizon on your right.  It was from there I saw the ship floating along.  It was mimicking a commercial jet with a tail, wings and fuselage.  No logos, very ethereal, shiny with a large Sun glint radiating off its side flying against a pale blue sky.  As I watched, it suddenly disappeared.;22.0899;-159.3482
