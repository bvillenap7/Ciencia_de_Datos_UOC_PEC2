We were out in the front yard in the evening and all of a sudden a metal (aluminum color) cigar shaped object the size of a DC-3 aircraft hovered above us.  We could see square shaped lighted up windows (like in an airplane) and two wheels going around the aircraft.  There were no wings.  It stayed above us for a while and then a bright light along with a hissing sound shown out one side of the cigar shaped object.  The light started to form a bell-shaped object out of one end side of the craft.  Then it silently started to rise and disappeared high into the night sky.  We called the Bonham Airforce Base, but they said that they saw nothing.  The next day I read in the newspaper that a lady who was fishing at night saw a UFO with a bell shaped light coming out of one side. However, no one believed us so we said nothing.;22.0899;-159.3482
