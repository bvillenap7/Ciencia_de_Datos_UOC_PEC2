I saw lots of satelites and I also saw what I at first thought was a meteor shower. Tracking these meteors I could see however that they were changing direction at 45 degree angles. Meteors don't do that do they? To pick up on what I said above I went back to my hotel room and poked my head outside to see if these meteors were still coming down. I saw one that was especially brilliant and looked to be 3 separate lights in triangle formation but moving very fast at a very high altitude. The lights went from east to west and veered sharply at about 45d ascension. By veered I mean the lights changed to a new straight line direction virtually instantaneously. I have never seen anything behave like this before and am curious whether meteors or any man made craft is capable of behaving in this manner. I went outside again hoping to see more but with no luck. This may or may not be significant but the west side of the island where these objects appeared to change direction is the Barking Sands Pacific Missle Range Facility. So this phenomenon could be explained as some military activity. I don't know. Please do not use my email address or name. Thank You.;22.0899;-159.3482
