couple of star like lights moving across dark Maui sky;2017-04-11 20:20:00;5 seconds;couple of star like lights moving across dark Maui sky we were sitting at the porch  watching the night sky , it was partially clouded but some of the stars were visible when suddenly in the eastern direction two identical lights appeared in very far distance , they first appeared as stars but they were moving quickly in synchronized way and they seemed to be apart by a considerable distance, they were not blinking like an aircraft , they were not helicopters, they appeared really far and then one completely vanished and maybe a second later the other one disappeared into the dark sky , we have never seen anything similar in the night sky , it was a very quiet night and I wouldn't expect any noise from those lights anyways as they really seemed to be very very far and I would estimate the source of the lights had to be massive;20.7616;-156.0397
