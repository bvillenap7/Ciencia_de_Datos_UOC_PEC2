8-10 firey red and orange flares fly over Hana, HI, toward Haleakala.;2013-02-09 20:00:00;20 minutes;8-10 firey red and orange flares fly over Hana, HI toward Haleakala 2 of us (my 23 yr. old son and me) were star gazing when red and orange fireball objects, looking like flares with no noise (however, there was an airplane in the vicinity which is unusual at night in this area), appeared flying from northeast (from the ocean side over the Hana dump) heading southwest toward Haleakala and disappeared in the mountain cloud cover.   I believe there was a lead flare at first then 2 side by side behind it in formation and lagging well behind the first 3 objects - there was a 4th flare that appeared to be going faster as if to try and catch up.  The 4th flare pulsated in the rear as it sped up.   There were several more fireball objects that followed the same coordinates in single file and at about the same speed as the first 3.  About 8-10 firey flares altogether.  The objects were firey red spheres with orange rears, almost like 2 balls attached together.   We began taping the 2 in formation and I called to my husband and friend in the! house to come see this as the objects kept coming.   There were 4 witnesses. 3 ages 58-61 and my son. 3 males, 1 female.  All caucasion.;20.7616;-156.0397
Moving light chasing the ISS (?) and another falling from the Sky...;2017-12-16 06:37:00;30 seconds;Moving light chasing the ISS (?) and another falling from the Sky... What looked like the ISS space station at a low altitude was cruising across the sky at a pretty fast pace but there was another smaller craft that was also lit up but not as bright that was clearly following it and gaining on it.  It was getting closer to the larger possible ISS before they both disappeared behind the trees.  I was looking in an East direction towards the ocean.   This happened over the Lauhala forest between me and the sea when I saw it.  Neither had blinking lights.  But then out of nowhere another light started falling from the sky like a falling star from the recent meteor shower but then it started getting very bright glowing a brilliant white light and huge!  Then it got smaller and dimmer and dimmer and then appeared to start moving in a parallel direction the north and kept going. It never burned out and then it too disappeared over the trees.  The cows were going crazy mooing loud and non stop during this event and have since stopped.;20.7616;-156.0397
