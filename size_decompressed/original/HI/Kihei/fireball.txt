A golden fireball in free fall, west of Maui.;2013-05-16 22:49:00;3 seconds;A golden fireball in free fall west of Maui Standing on my balcony, looking at the western sky, I heard feint thunder, then a golden fireball fell out of sky 20 degrees above the horizon...free-fall, straight down, maybe into the ocean.   This is not what asteroids or shooting stars typically do.   At the horizon my sight was obstructed with trees and buildings.  I saw a flash.  Odd.;20.7440999999999;-156.447500000001

OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE I NOTED A ROW OF ORANGE FIREBALLS (5 ) THROUGH THE WINDOW.  STARTLED I CALL OUT TO MY DAUGHTER HURRY AND LOOK OUT THE WINDOW WE OPENED THE WINDOW TO GET A BETTER VIEW, AS WE WATCHED THE ORANGE FLYING BALLS OF FIRE, IN A DISBELIEVING STATE OF AWE.   WE BOTH HAD A MOMENTARY THOUGHT OF IT MIGHT BEING A HORRIBLE METEOR STRIKE.  TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THEY WERE COMING TOWARD US OR AWAY FROM US.  THEY DISPERSED BEHIND A HUGE CLOUD IN THE SOUTHERN SKY.  MY DAUGHTER AND I ARE STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE EXPERIENCED THAT NIGHT.

3 orange flickering balls hovered across the sky over the ocean off the Kihei, HI, coast.;2015-01-17 22:00:00;5 minutes;3 orange flickering balls hovered across the sky over the ocean off the Kihei, HI coast. I was standing on the beach looking out towards the ocean and saw what looked like a distant plane on fire.  Flight speed was steady across the sky from right to left. The second and third fireballs appeared shortly after following the first from behind.  Their flight paths were not straight lines and eventually came to a halt.  2 fireballs faded out of sight as if flew directly away from us, and the 3rd got brighter as if flying towards us but then it too faded away.   Entire episode lasted about 5 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Witnesses elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));20.7440999999999;-156.447500000001
