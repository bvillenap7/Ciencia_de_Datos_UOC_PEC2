I looked out my window facing North East towards Haleakala when this ball of white-blue light came down from the mountain and towards me at a very fast pace.   At first I thought it was a helicopter, but then when it got closer (I couldn't tell the exact distance because it was hard to judge scale...I would guess a few hundred yards) it became clearer, and was not a helicopter at all, no noise at all and no helicopter features.   I woke my son up and we stepped out on to the lanai.  My son grabbed his phone to take a photo and when he did the orb stopped dead in its tracks and hovered bobbing up and down.  It had a central white/blue light that emanated outwards, red singular lights forming a circle around that, and  a lighter greenish glowing halo of sorts around that, as if it was in a bubble reflecting a green glow.   My son turned his phone off and a large shooting star went across the sky infront of it, leaving a line in a cloud.   Then the orb started to descend wobbling back and forth as if it was making a landing with turbulance as a helicopter would.  It went below the rooftops and out of sight.   We waited for a while to see if it would come back, but it did not.   This is not the first ufo we have seen here, but it is definitely the clearest.  The only other explanation is if some kids hooked some lights up to a quad-copter, but I think it was to big and moved to fast, and it would be hard to operate the quad-copter and manage the translucent glowing bubble around it.;20.7440999999999;-156.447500000001
White golf ball shaped object hurtling across a clear blue sky.;2020-04-04 14:00:00;15 seconds;White golf ball shaped object hurtling across a clear blue sky. Sitting in my Jacuzzi at 2 oâ€™clock in the afternoon, staring  at a mostly clear sky, I see very clearly a white golf ball shape object hurtling across the sky.  I watch with a feeling of satisfaction as it disappears into the clouds forming above Mt. Haleakala (10,000 feet elevation) my first thought was perhaps a drone, but I do have a drone that flies 30 mph. This was very different.  I would estimate that at speed it would cover horizon to horizon In about one minute.  I was wearing my two week old polarized prescription sunglasses and saw very clearly a golf ball shaped object that was perhaps the size of a Volkswagen beetle about 1 to 2 miles up in the sky.  It was hurtling in a straight line with purpose.  I am a dedicated Skywatcher, and this is the fourth questionable object I have seen since 1976.;20.7440999999999;-156.447500000001
