An unusual cloud with round discs and moving fast moving lights, inside of it.;2010-03-05 20:45:00;15 minutes;An unusual cloud with round discs and moving fast moving lights, inside of it. Driving at approximately 8:45PM on Friday, March 5th, with my 2 daughters (6 yr-old in the front and 2 yr-old in the back), my 6 yr-old suddenly became eerily quiet in a manner that startled me. After about two minutes silence she slowly muttered a statement such as, “Oh wow” and expressed she saw the blinking lights of alien spaceships in the sky! I was on a busy highway so I didn’t glance her way. Of course my reaction was disbelief and we spoke of stars and such for the remainder of our 5-10 minutes drive home. East of our home lies an extinct volcano with a prominent observatory and to the west, the ocean, while we live in a small urban area. The sky was crystal clear, a typically pristine and cloudless Hawaiian evening, yet, when she and I hopped out of the car (it is a large outdoor parking lot), I spotted in the sky, a lone, transparent cloud hovering about 30 feet above us. As far as I can tell, no one else is around. I see around 30-50 lights moving and blinking and “dancing” very quickly inside of the cloud. Both of us rub our eyes wondering if our vision is messed up. The cloud is maybe the size of a small, one story home and doesn’t move but the lights are bouncy and wild, like we were watching a light show, but nothing I could imagine projected the lights, onto the solo cloud, from below it was absolutely illogical. I viewed it for maybe 2 or 3 minutes and it “felt” “celebratory”. My daughter studied the phenomena in the car for 10 minutes, and described it as 4 round spaceships that initially rotated super fast, clockwise and then, counterclockwise. One of the discs stood apart, however and didn’t move like the others. The 3 disc’s movement altered from circular to a more randomness, when we were in the parking lot. She also explained the cloud with ships, didn’t have a “top” (lid) to it. I’m not certain if she meant the cloud or the ships or both. As I was looking at it, my feeling wasn’t of fear at all. My 2 yr-old needed to be retrieved from the car so I decided to attend to her and then watch the strange cloud after I gathered up my baby, but in a manner of about a minute the entire thing had vanished. My six year-old had been looking away, too, so missed its disappearance. I told her it was an “angel” so she wouldn’t be afraid, and every trace of lights and ghost-like cloud substance, dematerialized within under a minute.;20.7440999999999;-156.447500000001
6 yr-old daughter and Mom spotted 4 spaceships in a large cloud on a clear Hawaii night.;2010-03-05 21:00:00;15 minutes;6 yr-old daughter and Mom spotted 4 spaceships in a large cloud on a clear Hawaii night. I was driving south at approximately 8:45 PM on March 5, 2010, and my 6-yr-old daughter was in the passenger seat, singing a song. Suddenly she stopped singing and because of the sudden quiet she emitted, as a Mom, it sort of startled me. But I was driving on a busy highway and concentrated on the road instead of attending to her. After about 10 seconds she finally expressed a sound (she'd been staring intently out the window). She said: Oh, wow or something similar and that she was watching a UFO!   Of course my initial reaction was to totally dismiss it, like she was being childish and I told her there was no such thing, it was just twinkling in the stars.  In Hawaii, of course, the clear night sky is utterly spectacular and pristine. I never glanced in her direction and we talked about space for the remainder of the ride. We pulled into our apartment complex's parking lot, about 5-10 minutes later and we both got out of the car.  I still needed to get my 2 yr-old out of the car, who was sitting in a car seat in the back, but something made me look up in the sky first.  The sky was completely sparkling clean with no clouds.   Directly above us I saw a large cloud with a bunch of multiple dancing lights inside, as if someone was projecting a light show into a cloud.  My 6 yr-old can describe it more accurately since she watched it longer than I did. I couldn't believe what I saw.  It didn't make any logical sense. A lot of my mental energy went into attempting to process the meaning of it all, as I was watching it.  The only possible explanation I could think of, was that a big light show was happening on the beach about 100 feet below me and being projected into a cloud.  The lights were dancing quickly and there were many lights, like a show.  The only other answer was that it was a UFO. My 6 yr-old's description, is better since I needed to attend to my 2 yr-old abruptly:  She said it was 3 to 4 circles of lights (like a craft) in the transparent cloud (the cloud reminded me of the material a ghost would be made out of, invisible, yet, not invisible).  When my daughter initially saw the thing in the car she said the circles, were dancing around in circles really fast, going first, clockwise and then, counter clockwise, in rhythmic motion.  Later, when we saw it in the parking lot, the lights changed movement and direction: blinking sort of haphazardly but with purpose, not clumsy, and not going in just circles any more and they were dancing quickly.  To me, dancing lights fits well because the feeling I received was that of a kind of rhythmic motion and almost celebratory, as if a light show was taking place. My daughter saw the lights as: about, 4 circular crafts, with fast blinking lights. Neither my daughter nor I could believe what we saw, we kept rubbing our eyes to see if our vision was messed up, but it wasn't, it was real!   I'd turned to retrieve my 2-yr-old daughter out of the car and proceeded to discard of some rubbish in a nearby trash can, and the thing had totally dematerialized! My 6 yr-old hadn't seen it vanish, either, for she had looked away momentarily, too. The weirdest disappearing aspect, was the fact, the wispy cloud the lights had been projecting from, was gone, as well.  Not a trace of a cloud was left in the sky.;20.7440999999999;-156.447500000001

Orange light seemed to rise from ocean off Kalama Park and moved NE over the valley toward Kahului.   The light ascended and moved due north then accelerated and got rapidly smaller eventually disappearing into the north sky.;20.7440999999999;-156.447500000001
Daughter and I were talking our telescope outside @ ~11pm when we were mystified by this gliding stream of orange and yellow lights.;2016-06-30 23:00:00;5 minutes;My daughter and I were talking our telescope outside around 11pm, when we were mystified by this gliding stream of orange and yellow lights attached to a circular craft.  What was so strange was we couldn't tell if it was extremely close or far away.  I thought it was close, but then it disappeared.   A half hour later we saw it float by again and we ran inside.;20.7440999999999;-156.447500000001

A strange amber orange glow suddenly lit up behind the tree in the neighbor's yard, catching my eye.  I immediately sat up to get a better look, watched it drop down as if out of the atmosphere, before taking a sharp curve to the right heading east across the sky, bobbing slightly. It moved faster than the planes that land, and was gone out of sight in mere seconds. 30 mins later an airplane passed through my windows view, much slower with blinking white lights, heading the same direction.;20.7440999999999;-156.447500000001
