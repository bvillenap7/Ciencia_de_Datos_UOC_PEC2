My wife and I were on the 18th fairway at Waikoloa Village Golf Course.  We witnessed a fireball through some distant trees (1 object).   I had my cell phone on me so I ran out into the fairways with my video going,  I manage to briefly capture the object.  It moved from north to south probably 200 feet above the ground.  We observe the object going south from the village to the coast and then suddenly accelerated at a high rate of speed disappearing directly into a large cloud.  We were both stunned..  There was no sound and it seemed to pulse in a rythmic way. I am 100% sure (I have a still shot taken from my video footage) this was NOT a physical object, it was energy.
