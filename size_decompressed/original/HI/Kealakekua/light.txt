Windows equipped with screens are open all the time.   I saw 3 very bright lights in the sky all lined up.  The lights were very close to land.  The lights looked like stars but they appeared to be blinking.   I was not afraid when I looked at them.  In fact the lights were like giant diamonds in the sky but again very close to land.   I tossd & turned for almost an hour & got up to use the restroom.  When I returned, all 3 lights were gone!  There is only black sky now.  Wow!  I have talked to people recently on Big Island, Hi, who have reported sightings.  I think I definitely saw something unusual.;19.5277;-155.9339
