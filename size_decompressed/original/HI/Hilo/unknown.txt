Bright light at car level;1989-06-01 20:00:00;2 hours;Bright light at car level I was driving down the cane road going home at 8pm When a really bright light came behind me.  I drove for a distance then tried to wave the vehicle to pass me.  The light was at car level, so I didn't think much about it.  I tried to wave it over again, but it wouldn't pass.  I slowed down.It slowed down.  I sped up. It sped up. Keeping my exact speed.  I backed up, it backed up. Finally I pulled over to the side of the road to let it pass,cane roads are very narrow, one lane.  It stoppped. I shut off the engine, there was no sound coming from its engine.  I got out of my car but the light was so intense that I couldn't see what was there.  I started to walk towards the light.  I stopped about 10 feet from it.  I still could not see or hear any vehicle.  Only silence.  I thought it wasn't wise to persue this any further, so I walked back to my car and got in.  Now this was a matter of a few minutes.  As soon as I started to drive away the light disappeared. When I got home, a 15 minute drive, my roommate asked me where I'd been.  I told him I came straight home.  Why?  Then He told me it was 10pm. I told him what I had seen.  He didn't want to talk about it. Has anyone else seen this. I didn't go anywhere but to see this and straight back to my car. I know it has been some time since I've seen this, but I didn't know about these sites. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));19.7060344380405;-155.092790778097
Witnessed lights in the NE sky from Hilo, HI., that moved rapidly and erratically for about 30 min.  ((NUFORC Note:  Star??  PD));2015-03-17 05:00:00;30 minutes;witnessed lights in the NE sky from Hilo, HI., that moved rapidly and erratically for about 30 minutes. Looking at the early morning sky, North east from Hilo in the Waimea direction, I noticed a flickering light.  As I looked on, I noticed that it was moving erratically, up then down rapidly, then side to side and also making circular motions again rapidly.  I am familiar with standard aircraft movement of all types, these movements were too rapid and erratic to fit normal aircraft.   Also, the lights began to change, color and direction giving the impression that the aircraft was approaching but in fact never left the general location in the sky.  I have never seen anything like this so my interpretation could be vague to some, all I know is what I saw and hope that my description is familiar to anyone else who might have seen this.
