Flame like object slowly floating 50 feet above us never falling shifted directions.;2013-12-16 23:00:00;5 minutes;Flame like object slowly floating 50 feet above us never falling shifted directions. We were coming home and saw this oval like light shape floating about 50 feet above us.  It slowly floated by and shift directions but not with the wind.  It did not look like a meteor. It sort of looked like a big flame but it wasn't falling, it was floating.  We had no idea what it could be.  It slowly went by and kept going for about 5 minutes until out of sight.  We have no idea what this could have been.;19.7060344380405;-155.092790778097
