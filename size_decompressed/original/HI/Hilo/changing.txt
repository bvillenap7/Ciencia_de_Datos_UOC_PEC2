huge silver disappearing object;2002-04-11 22:00:00;couple seconds;huge silver disappearing object I was driving down Kilauea Avenue, clear sunny morning. I was slowing down to stop at a light, noticed a very large object ,above the tallest trees but lower than the top of Mauna Kea. What I saw was a huge silver object which seemed to turn, and then it looked like a very dark colored wedge type shape,the larger end was on the bottom and and it was at about a 45 degree angle and I was watching it as I had to go once the light changed, I kept my eye on it and it disappeared before I could stop and look at it.  The weirdest, most unexplained event I have ever seen. The sighting was so brief. Never heard of anyone one else who saw it. I am reporting this months after the fact. I did not think it was a ufo at first...but what else could it have been? I am a graphic designer and consider myself a sharp observer.;19.7060344380405;-155.092790778097
