7 lights observed around Mauna Kea, HI;1988-12-02 22:30:00;2 - 3 Hours;7 lights observed around Mauna Kea, HI My wife and I were descending Mauna Loa to the weather station, at 11,500 feet, after a day summit hike.  In the developing twilight, we missed a trail marker and had to finish our descent in the dark.  Fortunately, the weather station has a red beacon over it, so we were able to home in on it.  Less fortunate was that we had to hike over about a mile or two of what Hawaiians call ah ah, the very loose, jagged clinkly lava.  This required a great deal of effort on our parts as we held hands and snaked our way across the lava field towards the beacon at the weather station.  One of us would get a firm footing to support the other while the other would then move forward.  Not fast progress, but we were able to keep our feet for the most part. It was during one of our many rests that I noticed these little whitish lights dancing around Mauna Kea.  It was clear, beautiful night with a few small clouds around the summit of Mauna Kea and one very large cloud directly above the summit.  The moon had not yet risen. I was suffering a bit of altitude sickness and was wondering if these dancing lights around Mauna Kea were a manifestation of that.  After watching these lights dart about the top of the mountain across the island for a while, I turned to my wife who it turns out was watching them, too. We tried to figure out what they might be.  There is an observatory atop Mauna Kea and we thought the lights might be a reflection in the clouds of descending vehicle headlights.  That didn't make sense as the lights would zip and dart very fast not only across the face of the mountain, but beyond its extents as well.  Then the lights would just as suddenly stop and hover.  Vehicle lights would behave in a more consistant pattern. We wondered if they were some kind of laser projection as we could see occasional beams of light from the moving lights to the large cloud above the summit of Mauna Kea.  Since the beams would initiate at either the lights or in the cloud and then terminate at the other, not going beyond, we reasoned we were watching some type of transmission. We listened closely, as it is very quiet on a large mountain at night, and could detect no sound which ruled out helicopters.  We would have heard them loud and clear.  Besides, the lights could move much faster than I have ever seen any aircraft move.  They were a most unique phenomenon in that they would dart swiftly from place to place about the mountain and then hover. We continued our descent of Mauna Loa and would stop to watch the dancing lights when we took our rests for the next 3 - 4 hours.  At one point I suggested to my wife that we attempt to signal the craft to see if we could get a ride down to our car.  Needless to say, whe was not particularly enthusiastic about this idea, so we continued snaking our way down the mountain. When we arrived at our car at about 02:00, the lights were still there darting about and hovering.  We drove down the mountain to Hilo and fell exhaustedly into bed.  The next day we both got massages and related the story to our masseuses.  They both commented that many people have had strange sightings up on the mountain.;19.7060344380405;-155.092790778097
Orangeish pulsating light is stationary for 3 minutes, then makes abrupt movements in zig zag motion to the left before disapearing;2005-11-15 23:14:00;4min;Orangeish pulsating light is stationary for 3 minutes, then makes abrupt movements in zig zag motion to the left before disapearing peach/orange light that I thought was a star pulsing slightly so it got my attention as I layed in bed(I had just gotten in so I know I wasn't dreaming).  The hair on the back of my neck stood up and I could feel like an adrenaline rush shoot through me cold when suddenly, after it was stationed for 3 minutes, shot to the left, still in sight, and then right back to its original position.  It stayed in position there for another few seconds before shooting to the left again and back before it shot off towards the right, but back behind it.  It seemed to pulse more clearly and boldly once I fixed my eyes on it, like it knew I was watching.  Just thinking about it makes my hair stand up again!;19.7060344380405;-155.092790778097

Six star-like moving objects over Hilo, HI.;2011-07-02 20:20:00;30 - 40 mins;Six star-like moving objects over Hilo, HI. On July 2 before  8:20p  1)  I saw a star-like object moving roughly west-south west to east north-east in the night sky.  After moving halfway across the sky behind some clouds the object suddenly veered to the right as in a giant L.  It moved quickly away southeast without a sound and became dimmer as it went behind the clouds.  My wife saw the object weaving back and forth slightly before it changed directions. 2)  I saw a second, dimmer star-like object moving roughly west to east again, much slower than the first object.  This time I noticed it weaving slightly.  I lost sight of it when it went behind some clouds.  at this point, my wife went to the bathroom, and noted the time at around 8:26 when she was done. 3)  I saw a third star-like object dim and as slow as like the second object, moving roughly north to south. 4)  As the third object moved behind clouds, a fourth dim star-like object appeared moving from the southwest heading northeast.  at this point, the occurrences were getting closer together.  I went inside to tell my son, but he did not believe me.  As my wife and I were talking about what we saw, we noticed  5)  A fifth bright star-like object.  As bright as the first.  It appeared in the east, yet somehow overhead almost above us moving very slowly southward.  We observed that it suddenly grew extremely bright and then dim, and then lost...perhaps behind the clouds?  Hard to say.  Some stars were visible in the vicinity. 6)  A sixth bright star-like object appeared shortly after a couple of minutes...or less...moving slowly southward.  It grew suddenly very bright, then dimmed, and was lost behind the clouds.  It's pattern was similar to #5   We waited outside for more activity...nothing...when we went back inside it was ~9:20 p.m.;19.7060344380405;-155.092790778097
