Bright cyan dot moving erratically in the sky stopping and going on a dime.;2019-07-20 19:41:00;7 minutes;Bright cyan dot moving erratically in the sky stopping and going on a dime. I was look from my deck when I saw a strange cyan dot west of me about 30 degrees up from my position. So I watched for a bit and thought it was a helicopter but when it started to move I thought a plane but then it stopped mid air and then the lights were extremely bright for a few second not blinding but similar to a laser pointer almost aimed at your eye. It moved in straight lines stopping after moving evry few seconds where it would stop on a dime and then without turning it would move again in a different direction. Sadly it left my pov by going behind the house next to mine and I couldnâ€™t see it anymore. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
