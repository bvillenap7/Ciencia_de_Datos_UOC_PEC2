Flashing white light that moved across the sky before stopping and turning red and sinking in the sky.;2019-01-18 23:00:00;45 minutes;Flashing white light that moved across the sky before stopping and turning red and sinking in the sky. I witnessed a flashing white light fly across the sky at a fast pace which I thought may be a plane, but way too fast for that, then once it reached a certain point in the sky it completely stopped.  Then the white light turned red and proceeded to drop down in the sky (in a way it would land) and then it completely disappeared.  The other witnesses had seen something similar about 15 minutes prior to me seeing something but the light had come towards them and then turned red before vanishing, so what I witnessed looked like it was returning to where it came from.;20.69;-156.4444
