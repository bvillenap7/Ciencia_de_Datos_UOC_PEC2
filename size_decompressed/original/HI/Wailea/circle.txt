A Bright Orange Pulsating Orb;2004-01-02 07:35:00;10 min;A Bright Orange Pulsating Orb My friend saw it first. It was an orange pulsating orb sailing through the night sky. It had no sound and appeared to be fairly close about 500 ft. in the air. I called my 2 other friends to come out and see this orb and they too were amazed. It traveled out to see towards Kaho'Olawe, an island near Maui.;20.69;-156.4444
