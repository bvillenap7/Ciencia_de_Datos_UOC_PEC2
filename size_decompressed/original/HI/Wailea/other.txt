Not certain if this could be from Barking Sands on Kauai.   Was perhaps 3 miles high when ignited and climbed to approximately 4 miles, went out for a second, reappeared and then out....total time of climb approximately 1 minute.   Left a vapor trail which lingered for approximately 10-14 minutes which was a swirl pattern.   Lovely and eerie to behold.
