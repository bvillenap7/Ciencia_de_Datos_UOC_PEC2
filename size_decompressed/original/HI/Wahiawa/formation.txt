Formation of lights move quickly across the night sky in hawaii.;2012-12-29 17:55:00;5 minutes;formation of lights move quickly across the night sky in hawaii At first we thought it was a shooting star.  Soon after we realized the entire sky full of light as we thought they were just stars starting moving pretty quickly across the sky as we were all in disbelief. We would say there was about 40 to 50 of the lights in the sky moving in a formation.   I tired to take pictures and a video but it was too faint and was not able to get anything worth anything.  After about 4 to 5 minutes we could not see the lights. It was amazing none of us have ever seen of heard of anything like this. Really wish we could figure it out;21.4971;-158.0419
50 UFO's flying in a straight line seen over Oahu in the early morning hours of January 7th.((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-07 06:25:00;1;50 UFO's flying in a straight line seen over Oahu in the early morning hours of January 7th. The white lights were steady. 50 of them in an exact line.  One behind the other. They were spaced closely together at random except the last three who were spaced farther and more evenly.  They moved about the speed of a commercial airliner at cruising altitude. They frew south and took about a minute or so to disappear into the horizon.;21.4971;-158.0419
