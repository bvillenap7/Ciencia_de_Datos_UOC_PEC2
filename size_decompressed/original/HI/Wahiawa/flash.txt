Bright blinking light over Hawaii.;2015-03-08 19:55:00;3 minutes;Bright blinking light over Hawaii. While stargazing, my wife and I observed a flashing white light between Sirus and Procyon. It flashed once about every 15 seconds but did not change position.  It was about as bright as Jupiter, which was much further to the left.  This continued for approximately three minutes.  I stayed out and waited for about thirty more minutes but did not see it again. I was using binoculars, but could not see it between blinks.  It was very small,as if seeing a bright star blink.   I am ex-military and a private pilot, this was not any type of anti-collision light and the light did not move. ((NUFORC Note:  This report originally was posted with a flawed date.
