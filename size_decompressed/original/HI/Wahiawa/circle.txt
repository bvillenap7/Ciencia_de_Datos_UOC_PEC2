Just arrived home from having dinner with my wife.  As soon as I exited my vehicle I saw a small but very bright red fire looking sphere in the sky fluctuating in size.   I immediately told my wife “look babe what is that”.  We then noticed about 7 other smaller white lights behind it all moving west in the same direction but in a very weird pattern.  Some faster than others at first then the same ones slower than the others.   All of them started dimming at the same time until only about two of the small white ones were barely visible.   Amazing sight and still baffled at what they could have been.   Glad I got to see that with a witness, better yet, my wife.;21.4971;-158.0419
