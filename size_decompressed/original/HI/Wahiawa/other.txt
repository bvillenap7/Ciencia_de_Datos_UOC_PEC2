Unique shaped object in Wahiawa sky...did anyone else see this thing?;2001-01-29 18:30:00;5 minutes;Unique shaped object in Wahiawa sky...did anyone else see this thing? Object caught my eye as I got off a bus and was crossing the street. It first looked like 3 balloons together, but was moving oddly, like skipping in the sky, moving weirdly, but steady across the sky (not up like a balloon would do) and then it began to change shape or gave a different view and I noticed it was paper thin, and then realized it was not balloons and looked very foreign in the sky. Watched it slowly crossing the sky heading north west in a steady path, but the object was flexible or flexing. Very hard to describe, but watched for awhile and kept the object in view for a long time. It did not go up or down, no noise and I wish I took a photo. I'm hoping someone else saw this thing.;21.4971;-158.0419
