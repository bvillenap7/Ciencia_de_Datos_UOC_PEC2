Fireball from the West Maui Mountains toward the Pacific Ocean;1995-06-01 23:45:00;10 minutes;Fireball from the West Maui Mountains toward the Pacific Ocean After finishing a d.j. gig, stopped in front of my residence and was conversing with some friends for approximately 20 to 30 minutes, when out of the darkness of the sky, originating from the west Maui mountains, a bright fireball could be seen travelling across the sky at quite a bit of a low altitude and slow speed since the crackling of the flames around it could be heard and it's shape could be made out.  It continued east bound toward the ocean where it finally disappeared.   At first, there was three of us who had seen this object, with myself being the last to have noticed it, however, when I've brought it up to the other two in recent times, they have denied having seeing anything of the sort, and I feel as if maybe I was fooled, but, how I can my eyes deceive what the other two also witnessed?  Also, I was the last of the group of three to see it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));20.8959;-156.508999999999
Fireball. Triangular craft, noiseless, hovering large.;2012-12-12 03:30:00;3 seconds;Fireball. Triangular craft, noiseless, hovering large. This event occurred the day following the fireball in th urals in Russia.  I was awakened by a bright light at about 3:30 am.  I got up instantly and saw an orange yellow bright fireball which was bright enough to awake me and instantly go to my window.  It moved in an north to south direction, tangentially at a low angle of descent to the east of the town. It was bright enough to light up the town, but lasted in total only five seconds in total.  I do not recall any sort of tail.  It disappeared suddenly without any noise or explosion. It appeared to my eye to be a meteor, moving at an extreme rate of speed.  It was certainly not a balloon or Chinese lantern. Parenthetically I saw a large triangular craft in the nearby Iao valley about two years ago, at about 3:00. It was noiselessly motionless above the highest local peaks of the west maui mountains. It had lights along its edges at the long axis.  I watched for 15 minutes or so, then left. I have seen several identical objects in palm desert in the past, over the period of three to five years ago.  I watched these for hours. Silent.  Motionless at night always. Usually as I recall around the same time of night. I have inexplicably become used to waking up at 0:300 and feeling compelled to arise and direct my gaze toward Orion.  This behavior began about six years ago.  I have no explanation. I add only that I had the feeling, based on just a gut reaction, that these triangular craft are not alien. Thank you.

We were driving N, when we saw 2 very bright v shaped fireballs merge, and then disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Rocket launch.  PD));2014-05-20 20:00:00;10 minutes;My husband and I were driving north, home, when we saw 2 very bright v shaped fireballs, merge, and then disappeared. One was above the other over the West Maui Mountains.  The top one was very bright and a large V shape.  The light below was like a squiggle, if that makes sense.   It snagged shape into a fireball and then disappeared!!;20.8959;-156.508999999999
