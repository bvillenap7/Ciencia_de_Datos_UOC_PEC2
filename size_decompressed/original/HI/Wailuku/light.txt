Large white light that changed speed and direction viewed over land wailuku maui.;2013-12-06 19:30:00;30 minutes;large white light that changed speed and direction viewed over land wailuku maui. bright white light like a star but it moved slowly in a straight line then changed to a 45 degree angle then moved in a slow circle and finally sped out of sight in a straight line. Patterns and speed changed.  There was no trail, no sound.  Not in airport flight pattern.  About 20 min. later there was what appeared to be a meteor, a large falling fiery object with a tail like an over sized shooting star.;20.8959;-156.508999999999

My boyfriend and I were fishing, early morning right before the sunrise   down Lower Waiehu (Wailuku, Maui) when all of a sudden he yelled LOOK And pointed up in the sky.  That when I looked up and witnessed about more than 80+ big bright shining lights, all moving the same speed and in the same direction moving across the big sky and then jus disappearing into the night sky .;20.8959;-156.508999999999
