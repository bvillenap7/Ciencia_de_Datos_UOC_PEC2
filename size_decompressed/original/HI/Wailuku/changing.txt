Perfect semi-circle band of clouds on eastern maui over ocean;2014-09-23 04:40:00;20 minutes;perfect semi-circle band of clouds on eastern maui over ocean I was sitting in the back yard having coffee.  Looking east over the ocean,I saw a perfect semi-circle on the horizon.  Along the circumference was a band of white that looked like clouds.  The inside of the semi-circle was clear, because I could see stars.  I could not see stars through the white band.  Estimated it was about 15 miles out.  The base diameter approx.2 miles, radius 1 mile,thickness of white band 1/10th of radius.  The top was about 20 degrees above the horizon.  As time went on the semi circle expanded proportionally until it dissipated at about 75-80 degrees above the horizon.  I did not see any type of craft or hear any noise.  It was very likely associated with the sighting on the road to Haleakala crater at about the same time.;20.8959;-156.508999999999
