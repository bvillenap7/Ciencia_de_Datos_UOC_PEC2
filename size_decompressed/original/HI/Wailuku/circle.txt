My wife and I saw several reddish orange light ballsmoving south west over Maui. There were two waves.  The first we've had five red orange balls.  The second wave had five more. I could not hear them but then again there were lots of firecrackers going off.  I could not tell what it was but it didn't move at a steady pace until it turned south east and disappeared.;20.8959;-156.508999999999
