Egg shapped orange Moon object over Hawaii neighborhood.;2006-12-20 19:20:00;2 seconds;Egg shapped orange Moon object over Hawaii neighborhood. My mother and I were driving down Ainaloa Boulevard toward Highway 11 at 7:20pm at night on 12/20/2006 and looking toward the ocean low in the sky above the Ainaloa neighborhood we both saw what we thought was the moon, a glowing orange colored oval and egg shaped object partially obscured by trees and what looked like a little bit of a cloud. We both commented look at the moon and then we felt an eerie feeling and it disappeared within 2 seconds. We both then said what was that! My mother described it as large and egg shaped if the egg was vertical with the bottom being straighter than the top. My mother also said that the right had side of it was obscured by something. This object was motionless in the sky and was the relative size of the moon, if the moon had been out that night but it wasn't, and the sky was clear with billions of visible stars. We both felt that the moon couldn't go behind a cloud that fast and even if it did, there would be some sort of a glow around the clouds as they covered it. It was as if someone turned off the light once they knew we could see them. This incident was reported to local Newspaper office.;19.507;-154.9224
