Intermittant light source and strange trajectory immediately got my attention.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible tumbling booster shell??  PD));2005-04-28 05:00:00;2 min;Intermittant light source and strange trajectory immediately got my attention. Object appeared as a common satellite except for it's direction of travel and it's light source was intermittent.  Object appeared in the NW sector of the early AM sky and traversed the sky in an East/Southeast direction. The object would illuminate in a bright white ligt for approxitmately two seconds, then there would be no light for approximately 10 seconds then continue to repeat this cycle until out of sight.  When the object illumintated it was brighter (more intense) than a satellite (with a steady light source) that was passing overhead in a normal trajectory at the same time(05:00 HST). ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the report is not inconsistent with the appearance of a tumbling booster shell in orbit.  Just a guess on our part.  PD));19.6103;-155.9176

My girlfriend said she saw hints of green, but I did not.  When she went to get jacket, the glowing slowly fainted to nothing.  Honestly, seemed like something burning in the atmosphere or a slowly moving, floating aircraft that suddenly flew off into distance .;19.6103;-155.9176
