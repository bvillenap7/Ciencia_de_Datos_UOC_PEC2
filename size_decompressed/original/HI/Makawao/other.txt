Visitation of beings into my home where I actually 'heard' a voice from the being.;1992-02-02 03:00:00;One hour;Visitation of beings into my home where I actually 'heard' a voice from the being. I was visited during the wee hours of a morning as above-defined.  There were several beings in my room.  I felt their presence and 'heard' a male-type voice telling the other begins, 'She's awake.'  I could NOT open my eyes.  I could NOT move my body.  It was as if an electrical shock wave was keeping me bound tightly together.  I could hear everything going on around me.  My clothing was being pulled out of my closet as I could hear the hangers scraping the clothes hanging pole my dresser drawers were being opened and closed and my books on my shelves were being pulled out one, by one, as if they were looking for something. I then felt a small 'head' by my head as I was lying on my pillow and I kept telling myself to 'open your eyes!'   I could not.  The presence said She will not remember this.  But I still do to this day.  I also felt something implanted in my uterus that was a triangular shape.  I have since had my uterus removed last year.  I got horrible cramps for three days after the visitation. I also had a visit from these same beings when I was a little girl in Texas back in 1958 or 59, if you are interested.  I know I have been chosen as a 'study project' of some type. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));20.8427;-156.333
