I sat up in Kula overlooking Kihei and the ocean from a distance when a group of lights presented from the skies seemingly above or around Kihei they quickly moved there was upcountry Maui and upon getting closer I could see there were many. Easily 100. I couldn’t tell if it was one gigantic ship or 100 ships flying in unison. I could tell the ship(s) could cloak as it was wavering in this way. It made no sound. As they or it went over the house I hurried to the back of the house and saw it continue to go up the volcano. It left a magnificence bean/trail behind it. Life changing and not my first time seeing UFO’s up here but this was beyond imagination.;20.7538;-156.3303
