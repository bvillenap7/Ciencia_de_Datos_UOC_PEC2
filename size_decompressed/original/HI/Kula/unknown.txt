Since that night there have been consistent reports of booms and flashes at random times of night by locals on fb.  I'm a heavy smoker and have spotted at least 10 since that 1st incident.  Something is up, lots of people are reporting it, I have saved as many screenshots of every report I have seen posted if anyone is curious.  Mahalo and be safe.  Something is up and I'm scared;20.7538;-156.3303
