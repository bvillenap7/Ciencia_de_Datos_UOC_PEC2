Oval lights in the sky moving in a circular pattern.  ((anonymous report));2019-02-26 22:50:00;5-10 minutes;Oval lights in the sky moving in a circular pattern The lights of about 6 were oval and moving from a very large ring that was circling closer to me to a smaller ring of circular lights further from me in a regular pattern and formation.  I could only see a portion of the circle when it was large and close to me.  The lights were behind clouds and at first I thought it was lightning without thunder.  But the movement was unnatural and appeared manufactured as the movement had a consistent timing.   It lasted about what seemed to be five to ten minutes then suddenly all the lights converged into a central tiny circle of lights and disappeared.  It was in the direction of Keokea and Wailea which is to say just south of me in Kula.  The light pattern moved over a fairly large portion of the sky in an east west arc of between 45 degrees and 100 degrees with 90 being directly overhead of me.
