sighting of unknown blue shaft of light, no object seen;2009-10-07 18:33:00;30:00;sighting of unknown blue shaft of light, no object seen At  about 18:33 Hawaiian Standard Time on 10/07/2009 I saw for over half an hour a very dark blue shaft of light (color was twice as blue as the clear sky) originating approximately WSW of my location in Kaunakakai, Molokai, Hawaii. This beam was uniform in width and did not vary in width or color until the sun set.  I could still see  the same light even after the sun set  but not the same color.  I could still see the same shape but the color was gradually becoming dark grey, however it was in the same position from my location.  This shaft disappeared behind the cloud level about 55 degrees where the cloud level staeted assuming that the horizon is 0 degrees.  Below the clouds it was crystal clear. I estimate the size to be a little smaller than a full moon.  Also the shaft of light was not jagged at all, instead it was razor straight.  When I got to my next meeting, I asked if anyone else say anything and  9 of 10 men saw exactly what I saw.  One person was ab! out 10 miles WNW from me and he and his grandkids also saw the same shaft of blue light.   The curious thing was two wives could not see anything while both husbands saw the light  (18:36 at Kaunakakai). At 20:10 I phoned the police to see if anyone reported anything and no one had.  Also I could not tell if the source was from the sky or ocean (there is no land in that direction) but I suspect it came from above as the shaft never wavered in the slightest at any time.;21.0905;-156.969
Continuous flashing light in space…;2015-11-14 22:45:00;ongoing;Continuous &quotflashing&quot light in space... I am seeing a strobing light high in the night sky.  It is just “up” from the star “Sasin”.  It looks like a star that flashes on and then off again (but I am sure it is not a star).  A geosynchronous satellite perhaps?  The flash of light appears approximately every 10 seconds and is sometimes brighter and it is sometimes very hard to see. It has remained stationary for at least 30 minutes.;21.0905;-156.969
