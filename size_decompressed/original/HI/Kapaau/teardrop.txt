Brilliant teardrop shaped blue-green light;1995-06-15 20:00:00;20 seconds;Brilliant teardrop shaped blue-green light Right after coming home from work I noticed an unusual Bright blue-green light just over the ocean moving horizontally at about 200 mph.  My wife also saw the object and she also immediately recognized the teardrop shape and color were unlike anything we'd ever seen.  I ran outside to the porch to get a better view.  It was passing about a mile away, and made no sound. It looked more like a streaking fireball than a craft.  I would've dismissed it a a meteor if it hadn't been so nearby and was clearly flying just above the ocean cliffs without losing altitude.  I watched it move up the coast until it was out of view. I'm reporting this sighting because of your great interview on Coast to Coast where you implored listeners send it in.;20.2167;-155.7967
