Triangle aircraft with a bright red marker light blinking.;2016-08-09 21:50:00;1 minute;Triangle aircraft with a bright red marker light blinking. Triangle in shape with a bright red marker light flashing offset from the middle.   The aircraft flew overhead from Pacific Palisades area directly over me and another eye witness going towards the Kalaeloa Airport.  I could hear the engines, but they weren't real loud.  On the bottom of the aircraft I could not see in detail, but I do know from the middle of the triangled shape the color orange was present.  It flew in a straight path and the sounds of the engine is what made me look up at it because for  1) this was not a normal flight path, and 2) the sound of the engine was not as loud as Hawaiian Airlines Airbus A330.   I never thought I'd ever see such a sight and the pictures I see online make out to be slightly the same to what I have just seen.;21.408;-157.970300000001
