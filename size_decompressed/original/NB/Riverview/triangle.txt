On August 9, 2007 at 19:55 I was sitting in my backyard.  I looked up and there was what looked to be a plane with wings similar to a Concord.  It seemed as though it was flying very low and was approximately the size of a 50-passenger plane.  It was light grey/off white in color.  I don't know how far this object was from me, but I think it was extremely low because from where I was I could see six brackets underneath (three on each side) attached from the body of the plane to the wings. They looked like L-brackets but were spanning out on the wings at about 45 degree angles.  There were no markings on it and I did not see any windows.  It seemed somewhat normal except for the fact that it was FLYING BACKWARDS.  It looked as if it was man made, it sounded like it was man made, but the fact that it was flying backwards totally threw me off.  Can someone explain what this might have been?
