Me and my girlfriend were driving to her house when we spotted what appeared to be a UFO.  The object was slowly moving over upper Riverview, it appeared to be a large, diamond shaped craft with at least 6 lights around it two where closer to the middle and were flashing.  It stopped in mid-air and changed directions several times moving smoothly and fluently. We made sure it was not a helicopter as it was far too large and did not make any noise as it hovered not far ahead of us.  We turned around to chase the craft which was heading towards the river.  It began moving faster and faster and eventually disappeared.  The sky was barely cloudy so we would have been able to spot it, but we did not.;46.0506;-64.8177
