Possible UFO siting over the St. Croix River during Hurricane Irene in St.Andrews, New Brunswick.;2011-08-29 17:15:00;2-3 minutes;Possible UFO siting over the St. Croix River during Hurricane Irene in St.Andrews, New Brunswick. I awoke at 5am on August 29, 2011, due to high winds from Hurricane Irene coming through my bedroom window. I went to the bathroom, checked on my son and then proceeded to close the window in my bedroom that looks out onto the St.Croix River.  I marveled at the sounds from the storm and watched the tree next to my deck sway in the wind.  Then the sky lit up where a cloud was over the water, it glowed red in a circular shape and a sound came from the direction of the cloud 3 times.  Then it stopped.  The sky lit up 2 more times after this with the same glowing red and same sound.  Then the power went off. This occurred around 5:15am on August 29,2011.  I tried to wake my boyfriend who was in bed next to me, but I couldn't get him to wake up.;45.0829;-67.0668
