UFO Objects Found;2011-06-02 18:00:00;2 min;UFO Objects Found There have been Several UFO Sightings over the Past few Years, Recently on June 1st 2011 15:00 hours, Sunny, Two Cigar Shaped Tubes over Chamcook Mountain, Travelling East to West, Witnessed by my Self and One other Person with Me.(His Third Encounter)  On June 18th 2011 16:30 hours, Sunny, My Son Witnessed a Orange Glowing ball UFO Hovering over Navy island Beach for 4 to 5 minutes before it when Up and Disappeared. It was Seen Several more Times over the Summer and on a Very Cloudy Night it was Seen by many People in Town Shining a Beam down into the Water. On July 2nd  2011 18:00 hours, Overcast, I Witnessed from Indian Point an Orange ball UFO over Pagan Point, Travelling slowly South to North along the Beach followed by a Flash of light, then I Felt this Very Powerful Wave of Emery go by Me and an Object Dropped from the Sky, By then the UFO Disappeared. The Next Day July 3rd 2011 08:00 hours, Overcast, I went Out to the Area to Find what ever had Fallen from the Sky near the UFO. The First thing i Found was a Meteorite looking, Soft Ball sized  Rock (1468g) with makings like a Space Capsule Heat Shield with Fresh Reentry Burns and Looks just Like an ALIEN EYE looking at You and A Map of our Solar System. Next to the First Rock was a Second Meteorite looking Rock the Size of a Golf Ball (166g) with a Very Dark Green Colour and a Texture like Reptile Skin. The Third Rock Inches away is a Bust (1466g) of a Reptilian King on one Side and the Queen on the other side Both with a Crown and a Horn on Top of the Head plus Teeth. (Very Creepy)  The Fourth Rock was Found Earlier in the Year. A local News Paper did a Story on the find a Basket Ball sized Rock/Meteorite 20kg (Now broken-up) With vanes of Gold, Silver and Copper. The Gold and Copper is in the Shape of Perfect 'Borg' Cubes, the Silver flows like Water. I Think this is an Area that Attracts Dimensional UFOs & Hitchhikers like Meteorites and Space Junk. I Would love to See that is Inside the Rocks, But after Seeing the History Channels Ancient Aliens on Plagues that May half Come from Meteorites this is Very Scary.;45.0829;-67.0668
