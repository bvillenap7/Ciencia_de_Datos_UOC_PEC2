Strange orange triangle.;2013-11-05 17:30:00;10 minutes;Strnge orange triangle November 5, 2013.  Western Sky at Sunset approximately 5:30 PM.   My wife and I where just outside of Oromocto, NB on Trans Canada highway number 2 when my wife spotted what appeared to be a jet trail coming straight down.  It was partially blocked from our view for a split second by a small cloud and then it appeared to split into 3 plumes, one going left, one going right and one straight down, all at exactly the same velocity.   We watched this for 10 minutes until we arrived at our destination, then all traces were gone except for an orange triangle with it's pointy end facing right and the flat bottom facing left.   Have no idea how long the triangle lasted because we had to go to work.;45.834;-66.4808
