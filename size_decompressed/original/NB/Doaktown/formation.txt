Triangular formation of 3 blue/white lights flying above a firework show.;2017-07-02 22:31:00;40 seconds;Triangular formation of 3 blue/white lights flying above a firework show. The small community, Doaktown, New Brunswick, Canada was watching the fireworks being held for Canada 150 at the Doaktown School playground, when the UFO was spotted at 10:31pm Atlantic time.  The UFO was flying in a triangular formation, but it appeared to be 3 separate lights that were round in shape and white/blue in colour.  They were not overly bright.  They flew over the fireworks and were almost hit a number of times before suddenly changing direction flying North- East rather than strictly East.  It came from the West.  Many people saw the UFO and in a video of the fireworks that I had taken a man can be heard saying, What's that flying over top?, while numerous other people gasp and shout about the lights.  It cannot be seen in the video - it was shot with a Samsung Note 4 camera which has poor low-light detection while on video mode.  I did however, get a photo of the object while the sky was dark and firework-less.  The photo is not of good quality and the object looked quite different in person, but this is the best I could do in the 40 seconds that it lasted.  You can see in the middle of the photo, 3 lights that form a triangle, this is the object.  Again though, it looked different in person and to the naked eye as the lights appeared closer to earth, larger, and more white/blue than the photo shows.;46.56;-66.1265
