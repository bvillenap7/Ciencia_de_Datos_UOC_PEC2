bright object bobbeb & weaved in the air and moved unconventionally for 2 nights in a row.;2001-10-16 20:00:00;hours;bright object bobbeb & weaved in the air and moved unconventionally for 2 nights in a row. i seen an odd looking star(or i thought it was) in the horizon in front of my cottage in new brunswick. i noticed it because it seemed to be moving a lot, relative to the other stars. it was bobbing and weaving a lot. this occurred over a river, so its possible that convection currents rising off the river were distorting the object, however other stars didn't appear to be moving so. it was too far to tell what shape it was or what it was but it moved unlike any plane or helicopter could. my family and i jsut assumed the air currents were causing the distortion. however, the next night i seen the exact same lights in another location at the same time. so therefore, it wasn't a star or it would be in the same location. 1 was a dull brown color and didn't bob too much and the other was star colored and danced crazily in air. we went for a drive into town the next night and i could see it from the road too, so the air current theory doesn't work. i wonder if anyone else seen these lights shortly after the cdn. thxgiving weekend?
