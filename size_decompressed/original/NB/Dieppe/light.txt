Bright light grew larger and brighter.;2010-09-18 11:00:00;2 minutes;Bright light grew largher and brighter. september 18,2010 . 11:00 am.  My wife and I were driving home from the hardware store when we noticed a very tiny almost star like object in the sky to the south Within seconds it grew much brighter and larger almost the size of my pinky nail.  Although it seemed to not be moving it began to dim and we noticed a shadow on the right side as though it was turning the light dissapeared and my wife could see a tiny dark dot where the light was. I was driving so i could not see it .  We pulled over and it was gone.  This light was very bright like jupitor the sky was clear not a cloud in the sky and the sun was to the left of the object.  We know it was not an airplane or satelite. If anyone else saw this light please get in touch with us.  Thanks;46.098;-64.7506
