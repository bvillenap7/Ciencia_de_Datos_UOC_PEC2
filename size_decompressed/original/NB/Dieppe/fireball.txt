Glowing orange star, or Mars look-alike, floating in sky.;2016-02-23 22:00:00;2 minutes;Glowing orange star, or Mars look-alike, floating in sky. I was walking home from a convenience store around 10-10:30 pm.  I am not positive about the date or exact day its been about a week give or take. Walking home I was watching around the moon and all of a sudden a fireball basically a orange glowing ball about 2x the size of Mars was floating along in the sky no sound or trail just glowing orange. It caught my attention and I stopped walking to observe it floating then it disappeared. about 5-10 seconds later it appears again.  This time it appears around where it started the first time.  My heart started to beat faster as it floats from right to left once again and disappears. I was about 3/4 of the way home walking on the side walk so I didn't go back to see once I got home.  I guess I should have tried to record it but it was so cold!;46.098;-64.7506
