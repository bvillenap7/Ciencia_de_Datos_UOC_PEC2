PD));2014-03-07 03:00:00;30 minutes;Red, yellow, blue, green lights around a bright circular shape form early 3am. Woke up at 3 am and looked out the window looking at the stars, but one really stood out bigger and brighter than the others.   Took out the binauculars to look at it more closely, and realized it was not a star and a form was visible.   It had 4 colors - red, yellow, blue and green.  All 4 colors blinked.   It got smaller as time went by, until it was but just a little white light. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));46.098;-64.7506
