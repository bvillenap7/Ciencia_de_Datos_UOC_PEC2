Bright Circular Object Observed for Over An Hour.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly Venus.  PD));2020-03-21 23:30:00;1 hour;Bright Circular Object Observed for Over An Hour Date: Saturday, March 21, 2020 – Sunday, March 22, 2020 Time: 11:30 P.M., Saturday Night – 12:30 A.M., Early Sunday Morning Location: Centre Village, New Brunswick, Canada (20 minutes outside Sackville, New Brunswick) Object Identified: Bright light, brightened and dimmed in sequence, moved slowly across the sky.  Event  I was at home with my boyfriend on Saturday night.  He decided to take the garbage out.  When he went outside, he looked up into the sky and noticed the light. Looking at the light for a few minutes to determine what it was, he was unable to identify it as a plane or any know aircraft.  He gets my attention, by knocking on the window and signalling me to go outside.  I go to take a look and observe a large bright light, hovering motionless in the sky. Considering what the light could be, we compared to everything else in the sky. It wasn’t a star, nor the north star, as it was far too bright and large. It was not an airplane as it hovered motionlessly for over 20 minutes. It defies all explanation of a typical aircraft, as there were no observable wings or engines. The object was a solid circular object that would brighten and dim in sequence, not is a flashing motion, but more like a dimmer light being switched from high to low. The object was also quite large, even with the light dimmed, the object could have easily been anywhere from 100 – 200 feet in diameter. After hovering for 20 minutes, the light slowly began to move slowly away. The light was first observed in the northwest and eventually began moving northeast. The light was observed for well over an hour before it disappeared from view, into the night sky.;45.9204;-64.3744
