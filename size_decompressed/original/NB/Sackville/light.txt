Single white light that dove downward;2003-02-16 20:36:00;15 seconds;Single white light that dove downward At 8:36, I was sitting on my couch looking across to our living room window.  It faces a field and trees beyond, down to the Tantramar Marsh.  I saw a single, white light, like a headlight from a plane above the trees.  It brightened and then dove straight down behind the trees, like a flare, but faster.  It had no tail.  There is nothing beyond the trees except a Ducks Unlimited pond.  I checked the clock immediately, turned out the living room lights and watched to see if I could see it again.  The night was clear and cold and the full moon was at the other side of the house.  A few days later, my daughter told me she heard the radio announcer say that night he saw something, and the Moncton paper apparently reported that lights had been seen in the sky. As for me, I'm ((age deleted)), a married mother of ((more than one child)), living in a new house.  I'm a ((volunteer position with youngsters)), and a retired ((public servant)).  I've never seen anything unexplained before.  I wasn't staring out the window, but rather, the light caught my eye.;45.9204;-64.3744
