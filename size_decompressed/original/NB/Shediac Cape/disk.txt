Flying saucer with green, blue and red lights flying over Shediac, NB.;2014-02-22 19:00:00;2 minutes;Flying saucer with green, blue and red lights flying over Shediac, NB. I was outside with a friend when we suddenly saw a disc shaped craft flying right over us.  The color of the craft seemed to be black, and it had blue, red and green lights all around the craft.  The craft had a glass bubble over top of it.  The whole thing was continuously spinning as it flew across the sky with no sound.  I am pretty sure that i saw a shadow through the glass bubble.  The sighting lasted about 2 min approx. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
