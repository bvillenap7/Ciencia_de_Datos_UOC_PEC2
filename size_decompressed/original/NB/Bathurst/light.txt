Sporadically moving color changing light;2013-04-28 23:00:00;non stop;sporadically moving color changing light on any given clear night i can observe what looks to be ufo's, they flash many different colors and move sporadically.  i have seen these all over New Brunswick. including Fredericton, and Dalhousie. i am convinced that either the government or extra terrestrials are monitoring or guarding the earth.. i am curious as to weather or not these can be seen all around the world. i think most people glance up and just assume that it is a star. but look for more then a minute and you will be convinced there is something up there!  I've been watching these things for years! and it never ceases to amaze me and others whom i show.;47.6164;-65.6544
