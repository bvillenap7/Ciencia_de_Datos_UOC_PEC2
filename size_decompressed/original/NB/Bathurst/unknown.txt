When driving from Bathurst to Caraquet, NB, we saw an unidentified object in the night sky that was moving very (faster than I imagine a plane or drone could move) quickly change course.   It then streaked towards the ground, emitting green fire/light for about 2 seconds.   We couldn't tell how large or far away it was, but its movements were very irregular.;47.6164;-65.6544
