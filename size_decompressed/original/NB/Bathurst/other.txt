Unknown flying object spotted.;2016-06-22 00:00:00;30 minutes;Unknown flying object spotted I seen an object in the sky about 1230 am.  I watched it hover over the city for about 20 min. and it started to move very slowly,  it was very quiet and did not look very far from where I was  watching it.   I was surprised there was no noise.  It was round at the top with two long tails hanging from the bottom of the object,  it was very bright.  It continued to move just over a large building in the distance over the college area of town, it went down behind the building very fast, so fast I thought whatever it was crashed and I awaited for a bang, or loud noise in which there was none,    I have only told a few people in my town, but cannot believe no other person has see this.  I feel it has to be reported.;47.6164;-65.6544
