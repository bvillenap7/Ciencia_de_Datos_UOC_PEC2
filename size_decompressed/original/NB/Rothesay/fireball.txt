Two bright orange firey balls flying overhead as family star gazes on deck one disappears and becomes see through.;2014-07-10 21:45:00;2 minutes (approx);Two bright orange firey balls flying overhead as family star gazes on deck one disappears and becomes see through. The first object was of a giant fireball-like object moving across the sky at a speed similar to the speed of the space station.  It was not a meteorite because it was way too large, didn't have a tail and didn't burn out.  It was not a plane because it didn't not have blinking lights and there was a plane flying overhead shortly afterwards.  It made a sound like a low thrum.  It made the dogs nervous and they started growling. The second one came, heading in a different direction, less than a minute after the first one disappeared over the horizon.  It flew overhead and then disappeared, but we could still see the shape blocking out the light of the stars overhead as it moved across the sky.  It was not quite shimmery, but kind of like it looked reflective or see through.  It made the same sound until it went see through.  Then it was silent. Very strange!  We tried to film it.  It should have shown on the video as it was so large, but we have no video footage, even though our voices were heard.  The sound did get picked up, however.  We would like to know if any satellite or space debris has been reported breaking up in the atmosphere.  We've never seen anything like it and we love to star gaze on clear nights.;45.3483;-66.0014
