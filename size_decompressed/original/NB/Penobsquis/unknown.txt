flashing lights in the tree line late at night that went straight up and down;2006-03-28 22:45:00;30 mins;flashing lights in the tree line late at night that went straight up and down i was looking out my bedroom window, just watching what i thought were stars but this one star kept going up and down and side to side in the trees. and it would sometimes give off a faint burst of afterglow. it would flash a faint white, blue then red color. i watched it for the whole half hour i tried to even video tape it but my video camera doesn't have night vision. and no film in my 35 mm camera. it went down into the trees and i never saw it after. i fell asleep but woke up to look out the window but still never saw anything. but for a few days now my horse would go into her stall and look out her window hard in the same direction that i saw the lights. so how long thay have actually been there i'm not sure. there was starshine but it was very dark, there were vehicles driving up and down the road but none stopped.;45.7787;-65.3854
