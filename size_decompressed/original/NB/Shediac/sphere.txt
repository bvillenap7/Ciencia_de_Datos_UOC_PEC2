As my son and I looked up, we saw a small, sphere-shaped object, metallic in color, size was relative to Mars in the sky.  It flew by than just went straight up and not even in a blink of an eye it was gone.   Did anyone else witness this?

We suspect that he is a very good witness.  PD));46.2235;-64.5477
