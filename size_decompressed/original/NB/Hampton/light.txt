NE of Hampton elavation 40 degrees heading E rising to 50 degrees slowly arcing to the N and falling till out of sight at 40 degrees.  A very bright white light radiating that didn't vary as the direction changed it just got smaller until it was a pin point then out of sight.  It was slower larger and brighter than the ISS which went over a few min later.I thought at first it was a helicopter but the light didn't change in intensity with direction and there was no noise.  It was definitely following the earth's contour but I could not determine the altitude.;45.5342;-65.8552
