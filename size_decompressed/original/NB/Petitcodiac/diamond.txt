Erratic moving large Red/White diamond.;2014-09-05 00:00:00;5 minutes;Erratic moving large Red/White diamond. Went out at midnight to have smoke before bed.  To the west, there was a very bright diamond shape in the sky twinkling.   Was quite large at the distance away and moved very erratically, going in circles and semicircles left and right with almost a jittery type movement.   The object then moved further away until it was just a white (strobe like) light in the distance,  I then watched it circle around the horizon about 180 degrees and then it faded out. This light was very large and moved so fast and erratic there is no way it was a conventional aircraft.  I tried to take images but my tablet does not work at night it seems.;45.9383;-65.1766
