I had just picked up my daughter and her friend from a high school dance  And we were driving home headed west along the St. John river in Perth-Andover New Brunswick.  Just as we were passing the Carlingford road, in the upper right hand portion of my windshield, I saw this huge reddish-orange spherical object 1/3  bigger than a full moon.  It came seemingly out of nowhere,seemed to stop and hang briefly,2-3 seconds, rotating slightly maybe 30 degrees clockwise then the object zipped off across the St.John river to the east and disappeared behind the trees.  It gave off no glow nor did it cast a beam it seemed to be illuminated from the inside. I quickly asked the girls in the back seat, Did You see that?  To which they both replied in unison, See what?  They were both fully absorbed in the details of the nights high-school dance that they never even noticed a thing and after all the sighting lasted less than 10 seconds.
