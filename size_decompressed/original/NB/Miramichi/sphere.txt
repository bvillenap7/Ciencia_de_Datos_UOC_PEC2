Saturday September 28, 2013  Went outside to have smoke, husband followed and noticed what looked like possibly a floating Chinese lantern that seems to come from the ground and float through the night sky for 2-3 blocks over through the backyards.  Then it moved up slightly and then disappeared. The complete time lapse was probably 2-3 minutes.  It was bright orange and yellow, it was a steady glow of light it didn't hoover, it moved slow steady pase and made no noise. It was sphere shaped.;47.0510266666667;-65.5839222222222
