Advent amateur astronomer witnessed phenomenon;2012-06-02 02:25:00;1 minute;Advent amateur astronomer witnessed phenomenon I saw a bright white flash of light to the right of cepheus.  Ignoring it thinking it was a comet from the corner of my eye I seen it flash again.  It was very high up and continued at a steady velocity moving right of cepheus.  It was different from an aircraft or satellite because it would only light up with white light every 20-30 seconds and while doing so it would also glow for 3 seconds allowing me to make out the shape.;47.0510266666667;-65.5839222222222
