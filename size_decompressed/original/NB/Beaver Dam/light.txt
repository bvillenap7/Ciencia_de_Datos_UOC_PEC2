Lights over Oromocto;2007-05-04 01:05:00;10 Minutes;Lights over Oromocto Friday May 4, 2007 At about 1:05am I went out to the patio to have a cigarette.  I live in Beaver Dam which is just outside Fredericton, NB.   I was looking in the general direction of Oromocto from there.   Just above the tree line I saw what at first glance I thought was just another plane.  The longer I looked at it the more I realized that it was not a plane.  The colored flashing of the lights were completely random.  They had no pattern to them like a normal plane.  The next thing I noticed was that it was barely moving.  During the 10 minutes that it was visable it only moved slightly from my right to left.  Then disappeared. I called CFB Gagetown in the morning to see if they were doing any exercises or could explain the lights and they said there were no exercises and they had no planes or helicopters out.;45.7893;-66.7008
Multiple Power Ups in small area of sky;2007-07-22 03:00:00;45 minutes;Multiple Power Ups in small area of sky Now this is really starting to get weird for me.  I seem to be seeing more and more of these things.  I had recently reported seeing one on the 17th of July in Cape Breton so of course I seem to be spending more time watching the skies now. I went to a backyard fire in my neighborhood last night and stayed quite late.  At 0300h I stood on my porch just looking up at the sky.  At first I noticed what seemed to be a lot of satellites moving in the same direction one every minute or so and some going back in the same direction.  Then I started looking at the area of sky where they all seemed to be originating or heading to.  It was then I saw several power ups as someone else refers to them.  In a span of about 45 minutes I saw at least 6 lights appear from nowhere and become the brightest thing in the sky or as they were traveling become the brightest thing in the sky.  These flare ups lasted no more than about 3 to 5 seconds and then after they went back to looking as though they were just satellites traveling across the night sky.  On two occasions I saw very bright flashes of light that only lasted a fraction of a second but they were bright enough to catch my attention.  All in all between objects which did and did not flare up I saw in total around 20 or so objects moving across the sky in that small area.  WOW!;45.7893;-66.7008
