Strange orange glows in over Fredericton.;2012-06-16 22:45:00;5 follow minutes;Strange orange glows in over Fredericton. At 1045 got a call from the girlfrind who was just coming in the driveway from work and she said quick get outside and see this.  I ran right out the door and there was two orange glowing lights floating in the sky moving horizontally away from us. Not a plane or a helicopter or a flare.  They were travelling northward and one just dissappeared followed by the other a minute later. This was strange.
