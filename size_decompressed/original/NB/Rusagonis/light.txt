Bright moving light;2013-07-04 22:27:00;2 minutes;Bright moving light Was letting my dogs outside for a pee before bed, I stood on the deck and my eyes were immediately drawn toward the sky when I witnessed a very bright large light gliding across the sky.   Thought at first it could of been a low flying plane so I was waiting for the roar of the plane.  Nothing.  It was too bright and round to be a plane.   Silently it slowly moved across the sky, then it was like the lights went off and it looked like a star slowly moving, then it moved upwards and disappeared.
