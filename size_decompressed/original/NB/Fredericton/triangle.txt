A friend was giving me a lift home from band practise and I noticed two really bright lights in the sky just as we were turning right off Bloor onto Wallace. At first I thought it was a plane flying super low, but it didn't have the blinking red or green lights.  It was descending very quickly and coming right toward us. We lost track of it for a second as it passed over our roof, and just as it did we turned right from Wallace to Maple we caught sight of it again.  It was right outside the passenger side, where I was sitting, almost directly above us and very low.  I could see it perfectly. It was a triangular craft with three bright white lights, one at each point.  They were sunk in a bit, like pot lights, and there was one small red light that was barely visible just behind one of the white lights (toward the inside).  The light pollution from the city lit up the bottom of the craft.  I could see it's shape so well that I could see the bevelled edges and the details on the bottom. The strangest part for me was how smooth and fast it moved.  In a matter of 1-2 minutes – the time it took us to turn onto Maple and the then turn onto the Westmorland Street Bridge – it went from being directly over us and clearly visible to being so far away it only appeared to be a single light in the distance.  The path it seemed to be travelling was roughly NW to SE (I saw it come from the Brookside area and lost sight of it over the river out Lincoln way).;45.8671325966852;-66.6415679558012
