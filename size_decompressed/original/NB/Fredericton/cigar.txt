It sat there suspended in air ,not moving and it was at a 45 degree angle,it stayed there for several minuties.  Then it appeared to get further away, but i could still see it. Then it just vanished into the clouds. My wife said it looked like a paper clip with a smoke trail (very faint).  The other witness agreed with my wife. I think it looked more like a frisbee with a faint trail of smoke;45.8671325966852;-66.6415679558012
Metal like object, size of plane, no jet stream, no wings, no tail, not moving at a great pace. Disappeared within seconds;2006-08-15 19:30:00;10 seconds;Metal like object, size of plane, no jet stream, no wings, no tail, not moving at a great pace. Disappeared within seconds Object was observed in sky, estimated to be close to the average flight of passenger aircraft but there was no jet stream behind it. It was above and behind a large thunder storm. Could see the glare of metal from the sun but no signs of wings or a tail, somewhat cigar shaped, didn't seem to be moving at a great pace. I momentarily stuck my head in the door of the house to tell my friend to come and look at this object, he came out and it was gone. Given the view, which was unlimited, there was no way that it could have disappeared that quick as the time delay was roughly 10 seconds or better. Perhaps it was a satellite close to the hemisphere. It was not a plane and it just disappeared. No noise noted.;45.8671325966852;-66.6415679558012
I saw two cigar shaped objects, silver in colour, flying at the exact same speed and  hight. They were one behind the other in a line.;2019-06-30 19:00:00;20 seconds;I saw two cigar shaped objects, silver in colour, flying at the exact same speed and height. They were one behind the other in a line.  Too close together for commercial jets.  There was no exhaust trail.   Strangest thing I've ever seen.;45.8671325966852;-66.6415679558012
