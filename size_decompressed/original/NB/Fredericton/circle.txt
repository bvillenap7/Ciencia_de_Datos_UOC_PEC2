Unusual object, covered with extremely bright, white lights seen hovering over the downtown core of FREDERICTON, N.B.;2014-07-10 03:00:00;?;Unusual object, covered with extremely bright, white lights seen hovering over the downtown core of FREDERICTON, N.B. One[1] object was seen.  It was very bright with many white lights. The lights appeared to be all over the object - not the usual blinking, single light of night-time aircraft.   It appeared to hover over an area in the downtown core of FREDERICTON, N.B.  I could not decipher whether the object was a helicopter or some other craft.  It appeared to be of a circular or oval shape.   I happened to glance at it and the hovering nature, and many bright lights, compelled my attention and interest.  I do not know how long the object was visible however, after watching same for a few minutes, it flew away.   I would have filmed this incident however, my camera was not recharged.
