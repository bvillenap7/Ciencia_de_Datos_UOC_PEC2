6 lights moving in a steady pace;2001-09-28 23:55:00;1 min;6 lights moving in a steady pace A formation of lights (could be either one object or 6 seperate objects) appeared while we were looking at the little dipper.. it was moving from down the hill (east) up the hill (west) at a steady pace. There was no sound, and no blinking of the lights. They moved quite slowly. The lights were in a semi-circular pattern, so were either one edge of a disc or several objects flying in formation. They moved steadily across the sky and eventually disappeared behind some trees. Background: 4th year BA, 21 yrs old, male, skeptic;45.8671325966852;-66.6415679558012
V-formation of lights travelling over suburban street;2007-09-08 23:35:00;5 seconds;V-formation of lights travelling over suburban street My son and I were closing our garden gate late at night.  Suddenly, over the tops of the trees we both saw a V formation of 5 lights swoop in the sky.  It strongly resembled the size and formation and height in the sky of Canada geese.  Each of the five objects seemed to be a single glowing white-yellow light.  There weren't any rays of light.  The formation moved quickly and silently.  The v-formation moved in tandem like a ribbon undulating across the sky. It followed the direction of the road. It disappeared over the tree tops at the end of the street.  It was too fast for birds.  It was too dark to see birds.  It was too late at night for birds to be flying in this manner.;45.8671325966852;-66.6415679558012
Laying on dock watching stars and three triangular object went out of a cloud .

One went in one direction the othe two stayed together and made a kind of snake like motion extremely fast ...  Plane past few minutes after and they had to of been going three times if not  faster.  We lost them in the clouds but with out question was something.  They did not blink or flash or leave any trail.  They were very very high up almost seemed above the stars and had a bright yet foggy appearance.  White light. it all lasted maybe 30 seconds was nothing I have ever seem before and am quite honestly little freaked out about this.  To be so high up they had to be massive. Unmistakably UFOs with out a question in my mind.  There was no sound.  I am a believer now because my husband and I both saw them together . Amazing yet scary;45.8671325966852;-66.6415679558012
Red lights over Fredericton. Changed from Octagon to Zigzag formation over 10-15 minutes.;2020-11-21 21:00:00;10-15 minutes;Red lights over Fredericton. Changed from Octagon to Zigzag formation over 10-15 minutes. I was driving South East towards Fredericton. Saw 8-10 dim red lights in a shape that was similar to an Octagon, but the shape changed throughout the 10 minute period to more of a zig zag shape.  Lights moved slowly. Hard to tell if they were over Fredericton or much further beyond the city. They looked far away to be honest.  Lights didn't blink like a plane or helicopter would. They stayed solid red, but they were dim. I almost didn't even see them in the sky and I think at first just assumed they were stars low in the horizon, but realized they were all red shortly after spotting them.  Lost sight of them as I got into Fredericton so I was unable to get out of my car for a better look.;45.8671325966852;-66.6415679558012
