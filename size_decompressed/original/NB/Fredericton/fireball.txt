Meteor-like green UFO;2007-11-01 23:00:00;3-5 seconds;Meteor-like green UFO My fianc√© and I both saw the UFO. I do not believe the UFO to have been any sort of craft, terrestrial or otherwise, though Freddy is near a military base (CFB Gagetown) so who knows. We were walking the gravel trails along the Saint John River at night, headed west, perhaps slightly northwest. I had seen a shooting star earlier that night directly above us. This was probably a latecomer amongst the Perseids from August. Then, ahead of us and at a seemingly low altitude, and pretty close distance-wise as well, a bright green fireball entered and left our field of vision in about 3-5 seconds. It was moving quite quickly and of a distinctly spherical shape. Whatever it was, it was certainly not a normal denizen of the night sky, esp. over harsh city lights. My Paint sketch depicts the view from southside Freddy along the trail, with a bridge across the river, dotted with cars, in the foreground and the northside, dotted with lights, in the background. The UFO is in the sky and the red arrow indicates its route over about 3-5 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Several orange yellow fireballs in the sky over Fredericton, then the lights went out, turned black and disappeared.;2013-06-21 23:00:00;1/2 hour;Several orange yellow fireballs in the sky over Fredericton, then the lights went out, turned black and disappeared. We were in the Woodstock Road/Silverwood area.  In the western sky my boyfriend and I saw an orange yellow light approach from the direction of Mactaquac.  We thought it was a plane at first, but it went up into the clouds and as it got closer it was glowing like a fireball.  After it cleared the clouds the light went out and it turned black but we could still see the object because the moon was almost full so the sky was lit up well and there was still light on the horizon from the sunset. We watched what now looked like a black blob go across the sky and head down river toward the center of the city of Fredericton, then it disappeared.  About 10 minutes later another orange yellow light approached again from the same westerly direction, went up into the clouds and hovered then the lights went out and it slow descended down to the  ground and out of sight.   Then about 10 minutes after that in the eastern sky, closer to the city we saw two fireballs go across the river and they were quite low, lower than the other 2 sightings, and too low to be planes.  They were heading from a northerly direction toward the south and then as they crossed the river, the lights went out and they disappeared.   My boyfriend was able to get a photo of these two fireballs because they were closer and at a lower height.  When you increase the size of the image, it looks like two oval shaped fireballs and they were definitely not planes. These objects made no sounds either.;45.8671325966852;-66.6415679558012
Large orange fireball flying at high speed then then suddenly disappeared.;2013-08-30 22:30:00;1 minute;large orange fireball flying at high speed then then suddenly disappeared. A large object came into view from the east then switched direction and went north.  It was very large and made no noise.  It moved at a very high speed and after travelling north a few moments it just disappeared.;45.8671325966852;-66.6415679558012
