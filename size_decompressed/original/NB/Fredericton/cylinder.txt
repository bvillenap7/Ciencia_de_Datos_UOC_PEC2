Clear sky – no clouds. 2 commercial aircraft were heading west, with one following the other, in a staggered pattern. Both aircraft were emitting vapor trails.  At a point, approximately 60 degrees vertical from the west horizon, we noticed a third object at a 4 o’clock position, behind the first aircraft, following a parallel course heading.  It did not emit a vapor trail and had a very reflective surface, which was a lot brighter than the 2 aircraft.  This object also appeared to be larger than the 2 aircraft. After watching for approximately 10 seconds it faded and disappeared. I thought that the object may have been the International Space Station, which I have witnessed before, so I checked the NASA website to check the orbit schedule.  Nothing matched up.  I then checked the Iridium Flare satellite schedule and nothing matched up. We are not sure what we witnessed.;45.8671325966852;-66.6415679558012
