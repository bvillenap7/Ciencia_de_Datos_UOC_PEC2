NOTICED OBJECTS IN  PICTURES.;2006-06-06 20:00:00;10 MIN;NOTICED OBJECTS IN  PICTURES. I WAS OUTSIDE TAKING PICTURES OF CONTRAILS, (CHEMTRAILS) OF JETS PASSING OVERHEAD.  NOW THE REASON I WAS PHOTOGRAPHING THESE WAS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T JUST DISSAPATE LIKE A NORMAL CONTRAIL USUALLY WOULD BUT STAYED IN THE SKY AND FORMED A BLANKET OF INTERMITTENT CLOUDS THAT STRETCHED ALONG THE SKYLINE.  ANYWAYS, I DID NOT NOTICE ANYTHING AS I WAS TAKING PICTURES BUT ONLY CAUGHT THE OBJECT(S)IN SEVERAL PICTURES AFTER TAKING THEM OFF OF MY CAMERA.  I'VE CAUGHT THESE OBJECTS IN THE SKY FOR 3 TO 4 DAYS NOW. THEY ARE DISTANT, BUT DEFINATELY NOT BIRDS,MOSQUITOES, OR AIRPLANES. ((NUFORC Note:  We believe that the alleged chemtrails are nothing more than typical contrails.  PD));46.1537;-67.5884
