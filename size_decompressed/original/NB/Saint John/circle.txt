Bright white flash in NB Canada;1973-07-01 22:00:00;1-2mins;Bright white flash in NB Canada I never even knew about this site till this week so I thought I would report it now.   Actually there are two times I have witnessed UFO's.   The first which is the one I mentioned up top here happened when my friends and I were playing at a wedding reception.  I was about 15 at the time.  It was in a very remote area, all country.  We were walking down this dirt road and it was very dark, no street lights, when all of a sudden the whole area lit up with a very bright white light.   My first thought, and I said this out loud was that we were getting a bad lightening storm.  I looked up at the sky and there wasn't a cloud in the sky.  We were all very confused as to for a second as to how that could be.  Then we saw this round bright light rising into the sky, to the left of us, changed direction and flew away very fast and was gone.  After thinking about it later I realized that whatever it was must have been pretty close to where we were.  Maybe we scared whatever it was but I will never forget how bright that light was. The other incident was about ten years ago.  My wife and I were driving home from her parents in Memphis MI.  As I glanced out my drivers side window I noticed three objects flying in formation in the clear night sky.  Many colors coming from each, not flashing, just kind of glowing.  They were going very slow, much slower than anything I have ever seen, and then picked up speed and were gone.   It was hard to look for more than a few seconds each time as I was driving but I did get a good look.  They were gone by the time I had a chance to pull off of the road.  Only lasted about 30 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));45.2748965217391;-66.0548095652175
