I was located outside of the city,overlooking the river valley at a fairly high elevation and it appeared low above the water and was a substantial size given my distance to the river and its size. It was much larger then an aircraft and was silent and although changed altitude and directions many times they appeared smooth to be smooth transitions and rose at in increasing altitude and proceed up the river valley and towards our metro city;45.2748965217391;-66.0548095652175
