This plane sat in the air not moving and made no noise , no noise at all.;1992-07-23 13:00:00;10 minutes;This plane sat in the air not moving and made no noise, no noise at all I was driving in my car, up a road my house was just off of, the road was straight with about a 10 degree grade, I was driving up the grade.  My 12 year old son was in the passenger seat.  We were driving up this road when I could see cars pulled over on both sides of the road.  People were out of their cars and looking up in the air to the right of the road I was driving on.  At this time there were trees to the right of my car and I could not see what they were viewing.  I approached where they were and off to the right of my car in the air, about 4 telephone poles high, maybe 160-200 feet in the air was a silver Plane, all silver, just sitting there not moving nor was it making a sound.....I'm guessing it was about 1000 feet off the road to my right   The road I live on was 200 feet to the left past where people were standing watching this Silver plane sitting in midair.  The road I live on is a dead end road with 6 houses on it, I live in the third house on the left.  I turned and drove down this road where as I seen my neighbor pointing in the air toward the Silver plane.   I shook my head in a yes motion and turned into my driveway...my son and I ran to the back of my house where I yelled for my wife to come out and look ,she did, with my daughter.  We watched this Silver Plane for about 8 minutes.  The plane from where we are now watch is about 1350 feet away.   There were no markings on this silver plane....No jet engines under the wings, it did have a windshield and they appeared tinted just because I could not see anybody inside.  When this silent plane decided to leave.  It made a slight bank to the left of itself and slowly flew off.   This area is a fairly populated part of the city in a rural setting.   This Silver Plane was about the size of a 727 I guess ,not a big Plane but big enough;45.2748965217391;-66.0548095652175
