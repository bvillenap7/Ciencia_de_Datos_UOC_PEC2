We observed 6 small lights with a two hour pereiod. the First two lights were travelling in a circular motion and they eventually met each other and kept going in a large circle above our heads. They were extremely high in the air. They were as high as any star. They were visibally higher than any visible satellite. then later another light flwe in a straight line from south to north. Then later on another from north to south. then we saw 2 more a different time one more circling and then the last travelling in a straight line from east to west. This was not the first time we have seen them. We have seen them in summers past while we are sitting out looknig at the stars. I an very curious to find out what these fast moving stars are.;45.2748965217391;-66.0548095652175
Multiple amber colored lights in the night sky over Saint John;2011-02-04 19:00:00;10 minutes;Multiple amber colored lights in the night sky over Saint John A formation of twenty plus amber lights, randomly dispersed from horizon to horizon.  They seemed to be  travelling between 1,000 and 2,000 feet, in an easterly direction, directly over the city of Saint John, New Brunswick.  Many vehicles on Highway 1 had pulled over to the side of the road to observe the event.   They were travelling slowly, 100 - 150 MPH, but no sound was apparent, possibly due to the traffic noise emanating from the highway.;45.2748965217391;-66.0548095652175
Two orange ball of lights near Irving Nature park;2017-09-20 20:30:00;10 minutes;Two orange ball of lights near Irving Nature park My partner and I were driving home on the main highway when we saw two orange glowing balls of lights just over the Irving Nature park, in the swampy area.  At first we thought it was the top of a tower that we didn't realize was there before, but then one disappeared.  The other floated there for aprx. ten minutes.  We drove to the Irving Nature park to check it out and did not see any towers or lights in the sky.  It had disappeared by the time we had got there.;45.2748965217391;-66.0548095652175

I saw a long line of lights cross the top of the sky, around the tip of the end of the Big Dipper handle, moving from the southwest to the northeast.  The lights were larger and brighter than most stars and there was no sound.  At first I thought it was a comet, and then  I thought it was the Milky Way moving!  At the front of the line there was a cluster of 10-15  lights, all in a row, and then there were another 10 plus lights strung out in a straight line behind the first lights. What was really noticeable was that all lights seemed to be travelling at the same speed and on the same path.  It reminded me a bit of how you see in the movies a long train travelling across the praries at night and what you see are the lights inside the passenger cars moving in unison.  The length of the string of lights may have been 3 or 4 Big Dipper Handles long, and what I saw lasted about 30 seconds. Interestingly, I came across a posting  of an almost identical kind of sighting from Lancaster, PA, Aug 22/16.;45.2748965217391;-66.0548095652175
