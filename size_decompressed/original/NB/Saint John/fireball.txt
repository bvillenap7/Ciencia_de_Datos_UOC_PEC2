Flashing starlight objects hovering in sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Stars or planets??  PD));2007-06-17 02:30:00;10 mins;Flashing starlight objects hovering in sky The past few weeks my girlfriend and I have been noticing weird star like objects in the sky.  Quite often we go out for walks late at night and this is when we started noticing them.  They caught our attention because they aren’t like the other stars in the sky.  Different coloured lights flash very quickly (red, green, yellow, blue etc.) it’s hard to make out the exact colours because they change so rapidly.  They hover, moving up down left right very fast. A lot of the time they stay still in one spot then slowly move up or to the left, displaying no pattern.  I’m sure that they’re not planes or any craft that’s known to man.  I’ve spotted them a lot recently and it creeps me out. I’m going to save up for a telescope so I can get a better look at these mysterious hovering objects.
