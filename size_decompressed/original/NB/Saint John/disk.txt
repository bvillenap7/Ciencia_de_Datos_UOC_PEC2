2 feet long disked shape saucer , multiple sightings  500 Lights On Object0: Yes;2003-07-14 02:00:00;2 minutes;2 feet long disked shape saucer , multiple sightings   It all started in the summer of 2003, one night after having a hard time to sleep because i had the flu, i heard a loud hovering noise as a bright light flashed and covered most of my room, during the flash i tried to yell however i couldnt manage to get any sound to come out...probably due to shock ...when i focused to look to my window i seen a typical disk shaped object spining only a few feet away from my window...i closed my eyes and pulled my sheets over my face ( i was only 14 at the time) the next thing i remember is waking up the next morning.  I just figured it was a dream however my curtains were still open as well as my window which i keep shut...as time went on i convinced myself it was just a dream til about a year later i heard the same hovering noise outside my window ...this happened a few times over the next few months and evertime i open my curtains to look out i heard the noise become faint and sometimes in the distance i can see i star like object quickly flying away...after this happened so many times and i was tired of my parents laughing at me i waited to hear the noise again ..when i did , rather than open my window i woke my parents up and told them to look out the window..when they did theyt seen and object flying away ..it was furhter this time but they did see it , they just assumed it had nothing to do with me..after that sighting , i never had any problems of such again and once again i question what really happened ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
