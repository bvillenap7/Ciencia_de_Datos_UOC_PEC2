Low hovering ufo in richibucto, new brunswick, canada;2012-01-27 14:23:00;2-3 minutes;low hovering ufo in richibucto, new brunswick, canada On january 27, as me and my friend were walking downtown we noticed an orange-ish coloured metallic craft in the sky, it seemed to be quite low for any aircraft, probably around 150-200 feet up. The craft was some sort of orange colour and it had a almost oval shaped cockpit dome that seemed to be very dark, almost as if it was tinted. When we first saw the ufo it was somewheres around the wharf and stayed motionless for the whole sighting until we walked by a store and lost sight of it for about 20 seconds.   Once past the store the ufo was nowheres to be seen, the sky was completely clear and we never heard a sound from the craft whatsoever. Ive have spent alot of time around aircrafts in my life, and still ive never seen anything like this, its impossible that it was some sort if glider because whatever was in the sky was motionless and there is not any propelled aircraft that does not make any sound. so if you guys could take a look at this case you might make a finding because this area is quite active with ufo sightings, usually during the afternoons. I didnt get the chance to take any pictures, but im not making up stories, this is the real deal.;46.6925285714286;-64.9004714285714
