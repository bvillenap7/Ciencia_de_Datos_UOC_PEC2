It went straight down then went in the water in our river about 2 miles away towards the town of Rexton and it dove in really slowly and then we said omg I dont believe what I seen I thought something crashed. BUT then we seen a light coming towards our town in the water and it was flickering coming at a pretty good spped around 40 mph at least. Then when it came by our wharf the whole wharf rumbled and our car shook thats when we looked back at it after freaking oit and it kept going towards the sand dunes we have in Richibucto about 2 miles down river and it cane back out of the water and went straight up back into space at a speed we knew wasnt normal there is no way. And im telling u when it went bye our wharf. My friends car shook like hell.  To shake ! our wharf like that takes power and not to mention the wave above the lghts that were flashing in the water.
