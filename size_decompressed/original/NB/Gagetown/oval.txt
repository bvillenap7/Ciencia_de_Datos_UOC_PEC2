Army Training Exercise;1992-06-01 23:20:00;2 minutes;Army Training Exercise I was in the woods, many miles from the nearest town, but amongst thousands of US & Canadian Army Reservists.  I was dropped off a mile or two from camp, to guard an ammunition dump in a clearing of about 100 yards by 150-200 yards, surrounded by tall trees.  The moon was full and the sky was clear. About 100-200 yards past the treeline, a craft arose in the vicinity of a small lake.  It rose like a helicopter and flew slowly, like a helicopter, yet it was silent and lacked distinctive characteristics of both a helicopter and airplane, like a tail fin, wings, propellers, or safety lights. In the bright moonlight, I could clearly see the entire craft, which was long, possibly oval or round, and tapered towards the tail.  There were three sets of lights in a 120 degree arc around the front of the craft, which appeared to be windows, but may have been headlights.  I was paralyzed with fright and tried not to move, lest be seen.  I slowly turned my head to watch the craft pass by.  After it had passed, I could hear the faint sound of a jet-type engine, however the craft moved far too slowly to be a jet.  There were no runways, from where it took off - it had to come out of the lake.  Having seen many helicopters throughout my training, and ridden in them, I can say without equivocation this was no helicopter.  With the bright moonlight, there is no doubt in my mind this was neither a commercial nor military craft known to the public. Another soldier was posted about 1/4 mile away at another ammo dump. We had agreed beforehand to pick up our field phones at 11:30 to make sure we were both awake. Our exact conversation went: me,Hey, you there? him, Yeah me, Did you see that? him, Thank God you said that!  We had both seen the same thing, described the same thing to each other, and agreed we had both seen a UFO. This incident was never reported because our fellow Reservists thought it was a joke we had both concocted and we eventually dropped it.  But to this day, I shudder when I think of it.

Mutual Sighting;1992-06-01 23:20:00;2 minutes;Mutual Sighting I had reported this siting  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/048/S48271.html  several years ago.   Tonight, I saw your site had posted part of it here  http://www.nuforc.org/CBIndex.html  asking If anyone else was witness to the alleged event at the time, we would welcome additional reports.   Someone did indeed post an account of an alien craft the same day http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/050/S50944.html   I don't know that guy.  He's a Canadian soldier, I'm American.
