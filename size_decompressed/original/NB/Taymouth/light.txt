Cluster of lights in a straight line.  ((NUFORC Note:  SpaceLink satellites.  PD))((anonymous source));2019-05-25 12:34:00;1.5 minutes;Cluster of lights in a straight line. I went outside for a smoke and just happened to look up and I saw roughly 25 to 35 objects that looked like lights. The lights were heading to the East.  The lights were in a string or line formation. This formation appeared to be heavily clustered near the start of the formation, and the end of the formation.  The objects in the middle of the formation were not as clustered (more space between)but were still in a straight line and it appeared that they were able to keep perfect distance to each other.  I did not hear any sounds which I though odd. I would have to say that the lights appeared to be slightly lower then the actual stars. The color of the light appear to be white/sightly yellow. I have never seen anything like this and thought it could be drones or missiles. ((NUFORC Note:  SpaceLink satellites.
