While driving through Plaster Rock road, a wooded game refuge, I saw this luminous yellowish - white cylindrical object very high above the trees. It didn't move. It was dark out, so the object was easy to see. My friend seated in the passenger seat was taking a sip of water from a bottle just at the very moment the object appeared, and therefore didn't see it (very frustrating, because people donâ€™t believe you).  There was a fuzzy faint glow around it. It stayed for about 5-6 seconds, then it was gone. I had heard of others seeing something while on that particular road before, but had never experienced it myself until then.  I think careful monitoring of.this area should be seriously considered.
