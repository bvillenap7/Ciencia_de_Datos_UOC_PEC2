We've seen disk objects hovering over the tree lines with no sounds with lights circling and then it's gone we see it all the time but there's nothing there during the day.  We see these star like objects way up in the sky they peel threw the sky and when it's about to hit a star it will go around it or they will zigzag, or there will be two of them and they peel passes each other.  Some of these star like objects are very fate some are bright  Some are fate to very bright then fated out.  Theres all kinds of stuff we see we think the power plant is like a hot spot for this unknown activity.  We see planes and and shooting stars but we know the other stuff we see isn't.
