I was operating a crane for Canadian National Railroad by the Miramichi River when I noticed a black triangle hovering about 150 feet above the river and center over the river.  I was about 200 feet away from it. At first I thought somebody was flying a large kite so I looked on the banks of the river to find a person flying it, but nobody was there I looked back at it and it was in the center of the river, so I thought somebody must be in a boat flying the kite but nobody was there.  My 85 ft. Boom on the crane was bouncing up and down due to bad tracks that I was on.   Then it flew south at a high speed towards small mountains about 5 miles away.  Taking about 1 second to get there.  I thought I frighten it as my boom looked like cannon but 2 jets from Chatham air base.  Flew over my head and went exactly the same direction as the ufo disappeared on the horizon.  The jets was going real! slow compared to the UFO. It was black about 20ft.  Long, only about 6 in. Thick. It was a clear sunny day I did not see any lights.  When I got home I called the airport in Moncton New Brunswick and they just listen to me.  A few days after it was in the local newspaper and it said the triangle was seen across Canada.  After this happened I started to read a lot of books on UFO's.  One day I read a book which I do not remember the name it but when I opened it to a certain Page I seen a picture of the same thing I seen.  The book said it was remotely control by a mother ship 250 miles above earth.;47.1942;-65.9381
