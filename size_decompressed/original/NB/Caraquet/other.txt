Strange lights in Caraquet, N. B.  ((anonymous report);2017-11-25 15:30:00;2 minutes;Strange lights in Caraquet, N. B. When travelling in Caraquet, boulevard St-Pierre, on that day, I witnessed strange lights flying in the sky about 500 feet in the air, and I would say it could be 1000 feet from me when I saw those strange light first. It looked like a straight row of very, very brilliant white lights, like modern LED lights.  It was travelling at a regular speed, from South to Northeast. I saw it for a few seconds in my car, and then it disappeared behind the trees along the road near the old CO-OP store.  I got in a store for a glass I had ordered sooner. About 10 minutes later I saw the same set of lights for about 5 seconds, by the Carrefour de la Mer, and it was going straight for Caraquet Island.  It then disappeared from sight as I was watching. Some said it could be a drone, but it was quite large for a drone, and it vanished into thin air.  A drone would not have done that.  It could have dropped quickly, but not dissapear.
