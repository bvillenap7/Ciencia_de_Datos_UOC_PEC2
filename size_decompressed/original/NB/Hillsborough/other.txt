Not one of ours.;2017-06-30 23:40:00;30;Seen a craft, no blinking lights, with a reddish glow, flying faster than an aircraft then sped up really fast.  Was gone so quickly.  Tracked it as it flew over my head.   Seen a plane fly in a 90 degree angle from it and nowhere near as fast as it!   Wow, that was not one of ours.  I tried to take a pic, but what I seen was complete darkness on phone screen.;45.9212;-64.6562
