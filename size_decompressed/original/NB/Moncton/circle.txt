Halfway through my smoke, a small orange light moving across the sky caught my attention.  It made no sound, and as it passed, its shape remained the same.  While still visible, the site security guard approached, and we both could not figure out what this object was.  There were no clouds in the sky that night, and we both watched as it seemed to gain altitude at an arming rate until it had faded to nothing.  There were no flashing lights, or nothing at all to indicate that it was any commercial or private aircraft.;46.1020390804597;-64.7900137931034
