Large Square UFO over Car Ahead of Me, on Route #2 Highway, Nearing Moncton, New Brunswick;2010-04-03 21:57:00;30 sec;Large Square UFO over Car Ahead of Me, on Route #2 Highway, Nearing Moncton, New Brunswick I observed an incredibly large square UFO while driving on the Route #2 highway at 9:57pm approximately 50.42km before Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada.  This was seen for an estimated 30 seconds as it appeared over the car in front of me then carelessly hovered to my left over a forest hill.  Light given off from the horizon of a city behind the forest hill was enough to see the UFO tilt!   When first viewing it over the front of the car ahead of me, I thought of grabbing my cell phone for a picture but did not because I just wanted to see it.  When the spacecraft passed by to the left, I beeped my horn to the vehicle ahead of me, incase he was not looking to his left and I am not sure if he observed anything. I am glad I did not grab my cell phone for a picture as the car ahead of me slowed down after it disappeared onto the hill and I may have hit him.  I know the time of this incident because after it disappeared I instantly grabbed my cell phone and quickly called my best friend in complete hysteria. The engineering technology involved in this was incredible, to have such a huge square object hover in space.  I now do not define a spaceship or spacecraft to be from outer space, but rather to suspend itself in space. This unknown technology was far more advanced, even in comparison to Big Dog.;46.1020390804597;-64.7900137931034
