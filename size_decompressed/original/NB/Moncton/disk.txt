I had trouble turning the small volkswagon around on that narrow road so we could be siing facing the way we came in. The kind of night you can see all the stars, away from the city lights. To our right just at the tree line, we watched 3 or 4 tiny bright lights bobbing in and around the top of the trees. Then it (for some reason it was one large object as it passed in front of us)  moved in front of my car, at the tree line not far down the tree lined road which headed out to the main highway. It passed between the trees,  my friend fell to the foor screaming drive, drive. The size was so hard to determine as I was so stunned and frozen in my seat that I can't recall the size.  I would say about 20 feet by 15 feet high.  I remember it was definetly orange, bright, almost a checkerboard patterned side. and no sound. then as it passed through the trees, it never came out the other side of the tree lined road. I'm just reporting this now as we thought as usuall that no one wouldbeleive us. I swear on this story on my mother's grave. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
