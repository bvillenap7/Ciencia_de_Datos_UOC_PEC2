Odd fireball seen in Moncton night skies.;2008-08-28 00:15:00;1 hour;Odd fireball seen in Moncton night skies. at approximately 12:15 am, myseld and my girlfriend were looking into the sky at another clear night and observed what appeared to be a ball of light that was changing colors from red-blue to green. it then moved what seems to be a short distance to the north west and was followed by the same 5 lights but in different places compared to where we first saw them. the main light changed places in the night sky from below the tree line to above and very visible. it then disappeared and showed up at another location but alone. we have seen these lights for the past few months but always at a different location but not too far from where they were seen last. as well i have seen lights in the night sky from passing planes that fell behind the craft(s) giving me the impression the it was more near and ground oriented rather than high in the skies. if there are any other people who have and interesting perspective on this i would appreciate it if they would post comments especially those from moncton new brunswick canada;46.1020390804597;-64.7900137931034
Fire like light round with undefined border seen through cloud cover at 19:50 15 Sep 11;2011-09-15 19:50:00;Greater than 10 minutes, ;fire like light round with undefined border seen through cloud cover at 19:50 15 Sep 11 Last night was an overcast night with warm air pushing in from the south,  I was walking into the Greater Moncton YMCA at aproximatly 19:50 (10min prior to the rain storm), everyone coming ang leaving the gym was fixated with a fire like object in the sky.  I began to stair at it too.  I staired at the fire like light for a few minutes it was moming so slow I couldnt tell if it was moving or I was just looking to hard.  I felt weird standing out in the open staring at the sky so I went in the gym and continued my work out.  I was pretty sure the news would let everyone know what it was but there does not seem to be any other report?  Now I'm really curious?;46.1020390804597;-64.7900137931034
Blue fireball travels across the horizon.;2013-11-28 19:50:00;10-15 seconds;Blue fireball travels across the horizon I left work at 730 pm and drive to the hockey arena to pick up my daughter and son. My other daughter and husband were staying at the arena for her game and I was picking up my 13 and 2 year old to take them home.   I sent my husband a text to tell him that I was outside and to send the kids out to the parking lot.  I had pulled in front of the building.  My daughter came out carrying my son. I was watching them out the window of the passenger side door.   When I noticed my son didn't have a hat on I looked forward toward the dash of the truck to check the thermometer for the outside temp.  In my peripheral vision I saw what I thought was a shooting star.  I locked my sight on it.  It didn't burn out as expected. I actually got bigger as it got closer.  When the object was directly in front of my field of Vision I could see that it was the size of the biggest full moon you have ever seen.  Like the harvest moon.  The color was blue. In the center it was darker blue then lighter blue then white on the parameter if the object.  A trail or tail followed the object.  It filled the horizon.  It travelled diagonal in front of me and disappeared under the tree line.  I heard no noise or felt nothing.   My daughter was buckling my son in his carseat and there was no one else in the parking lot to share it with.  I know that someone else in the city had to have seen it.;46.1020390804597;-64.7900137931034
