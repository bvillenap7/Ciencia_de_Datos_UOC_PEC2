2 red fireballs;2011-11-06 19:10:00;1 minute;2 red fireballs 2 bright red lights, travelling at great speed, flew over Greater Moncton, close to airport.  The first light disapeared and the second light was lost in the eastern horizon.  No smoke tail visible.  Lights were flying one behind the other, the second being slighly larger than the first.  Wondering if it was a meteor and if it made landfall because it did not look like it was fading in intensity.  Looked like it was heading towards Shediac N.-B. Canada.
