Sphere with bright headlight.;2004-04-20 01:30:00;2 minutes;Sphere with bright headlight. Was driving with a friend on the trans canada from Petitcodiac to Moncton. At the first off ramp to moncton i saw a bright light in the sky and thought it to be a radio tower. My passenger then looked and told me to pull over. It was a sphere hovering about 100 feet in the sky, and it made no sound at all. Then after about 2 mins the one light on the front became very bright and appeared to be aimed towards us. The craft then slowly hovered close to my car and shot off into the horizon and an amazing speed. I also find it strange that the entire time i was pulled over onto the off ramp not a single car drove by in either direction on the highway. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
