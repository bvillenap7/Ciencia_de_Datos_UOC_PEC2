Red flashing lights.;2014-10-29 06:55:00;3 minutes;Red flashing lights It was the morning of Wednesday, October 29th, at 6:55am.  In the city of Moncton, New Brunswick.   While we were driving down our street we seen something in the sky coming towards us that was about  300-400 up in the air.  Once it got beside us it hovered over us for about a minute and started flashing a red light while we waited at the stop sign to turn left.  It appeared to have a lot of lights on it and looked kind of square/rectangle shape.  Once we turned left to go down the street it started flashing its red light faster then kind of looked a bit oval as it flew off in the same direction as us in the distance.  Then it disappeared.  Not sure what to make out of it but it certainly didn't look or act like an airplane or a satellite.;46.1020390804597;-64.7900137931034
Strange moving lights in sky..;2014-12-29 19:00:00;20 minutes;Strange moving lights in sky.. I went outside to have a smoke and noticed some strange lights behind my house.  They were lined up diagonal to begin with.   After realizing it wasn't a plane I called out my daughter to see and had her bring my camera.  The object appeared to move solid at first but then started to just change shape.   I wound up taking a video of it at the start then photographs.  It was in a triangle at one point.   I reported it to the local police station as well.  At first they tried to say it was a display for a buisness.  I do photographs every evening of stars and have never saw anything like this before.  They wound up sending an office to investigate but I do not know the outcome as of yet. I have photos and video that I can send upon request as well.;46.1020390804597;-64.7900137931034
