I saw flashing on the wall as though there were a tractor or some heavy equipment running on the adjacent road.  The light was flashing at a regular interval, and it was bright enough that it could have been some kind of equipment. When I rose, I saw a light in the sky.  It was overcast, and the light had to be less than a kilometer away.  It flashed regularly with an extremely bright light.  Nothing like an airplane.  Or helicopter.  There were no other lights on the craft, just one single strobing light, very bright.  The night was still, no wind, and the air was completely silent.  There was no engine noise of any kind anywhere nearby.  If it had been an airplane, there's no doubt I would have heard it. I followed it for a few seconds until it went behind trees, and I watched it through them intermittently for the next two minutes.  I did not catch sight of it again.  There's a hydro-electric dam nearby, and it was heading in that rough direction.  I've never seen anything quite like it.  I wish I could have seen it close-on.;46.0036;-66.8823
