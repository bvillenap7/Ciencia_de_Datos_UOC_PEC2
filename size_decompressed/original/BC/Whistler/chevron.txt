Lights over Whistler BC;1997-11-14 21:00:00;30 seconds;Lights over Whistler BC We were all celebrating the annual Ullr party in Creekside Whistler when the lights came over the mountains.  There was no noise.  The entire event came to a silent halt.  The lights were in a chevron formation.  No noise, no sound what so ever.  They turned to the North an disappeared over the mountain range.  We were told the next day it was stealth jets patrolling for the G8 summit that was happening in Vancouver.  Then it was space junk. And so on. Thanks;50.1211050847458;-122.950669491525
