Pilot (CF-104 fighter), witnessed a green fireball pass over car at high speed, southbound. A former Canadian military pilot reported witnessing a green ball of light streak over his automobile, descending at what appeared to him and his passenger as a steep angle of descent.  The object came from behind their vehicle, as they drove to the south, and it then continued to the south, toward the U. S.. The witness declared that he thought the object had to be a meteor, and he declined any further comment, or any desire to submit a formal written report. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness on two occasions, and deem him to be a very good, and reliable, witness.  However, he has elected not to submit a written report about the incident, so we have prepared this report, based on our conversations with the witness.  PD));50.1211050847458;-122.950669491525
