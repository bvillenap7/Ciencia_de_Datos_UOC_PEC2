Looked through the telescope and it seemed to be spinning and kept moving in and out of fra My mother noticed the flashing lights outside and told us all to come look. This is not her first time saying she has seen UFOâ€™s in our area. We all came outside and saw a stationary ball of light flashing green, red, and blue. It made no noise. We thought maybe it could be a satellite but it was not moving. We then set up the telescope. When we looked through the telescope, it seemed to be spinning and kept moving in and out of frame.  It resembled a diamond because of the way the light was surrounding it. We believe it to be spinning because the light fluctuated like the wings of a bird. It stayed for quite awhile and we eventually went inside. After about an hour or longer it was gone. We had also called a few of our friends around town to look and they saw it as well.
