Flying Fireballs , Piloted by ?;1996-04-15 21:00:00;5 minutes;Flying Fireballs , Piloted by ? My wife and I were at a wedding reception and ad just stepped outside for some fresh air . I noticed a light moving to my right . I focused on it . It was dark . It was low in the sky relative to the horizon where it came from . Its trajectory was a shallow angle , almost level maybe 5 derees down . The first fireball was Phosfloresent green . It was the relative size of a streetlight and had a tail 10 times that in length . It took 5 to 8 seconds to cross the sky . It was very strange because we heard the torch like sound of the fireball like a blow torch . There was no sonic boom . We looked at each other and ware amazed at the experience only to be drawn to the same point low in the sky to see yet another object almost the twin following in the same path seperated by 30 seconds but this one was different . It did not make a noise yet it had a tail of the same proportion , the same trajectory and speed . The shallow angle of decent made me wonder about these sightins . It was like they were flying . I have watched the night sky since 6 years old and have yearly events of watching the different annual meteor showers . Most meteors are very fast and hi up in the atmospere . They enter at a steep angle .  These were flyin not shooting . Most Unusual !!!;50.7033;-119.2683
