We were walking up the hill and talking.  Then my friend pointed out a light in the sky.   At first, we thought it was an air-plane. We were both watching the object. It was extremely bright and blinking, it was a white color with a haze around it.  It looked like it was heading in a straight line like a plane.  It was moving to the left across the sky, then would stop and hover while blinking. Then the object started to jump up slightly and back down to where it started. The object continued to jump up and back down extremely fast.  It continued to head left, still blinking.  Then the object jumped back several metres between blinks and started to blink again. Then the object was moving in many directions going forward and up, and down, then hovering.  The object went behind the trees for a brief moment then jumped back up into our sight again.  It kept moving in various directions.  It went up higher and then just vanished. My friend and I walked towards the area the object was we couldn’t see the object anywhere in the sky. It was a clean night.  There weren’t any clouds in the sky.  The object was about twice the size of the stars, and much brighter.  It was brighter then the street lights.;50.7033;-119.2683
