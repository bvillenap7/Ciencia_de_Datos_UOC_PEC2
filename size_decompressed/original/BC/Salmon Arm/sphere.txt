I looked over and my daughter was standing beside her and this woman smiled and said gently come with us I just looked back at the craft she then said the same words but  with more force but still  very gentle tone.  I looked at my daughter and followed them but I felt upset.  when we walked in the mall I got angry and ran outside the object and the woman where gone, I felt like I couldn't control following her.  she was very friendly she made my daughter and I feel relaxed comforting almost like.
