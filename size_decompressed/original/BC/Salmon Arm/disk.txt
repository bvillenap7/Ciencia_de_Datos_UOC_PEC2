I was inspecting a new lake lot we bought and were building on when I saw what looked like snow on the mountain.  It soon became clear it was not snow and the saucer object with a large deep belly was moving towards my posistion.  It was still sunny but there was no reflection.  The craft was massive and grey like concrete.   Made no sound and left no visible trails.  Hovering at 600-1000 feet.  About the width of two football fields.  No details like doors or markings could be seen.  I chose to leave before it got closer.   People near Glen Eden, or across the tracks downtown must have saw something.;50.7033;-119.2683
