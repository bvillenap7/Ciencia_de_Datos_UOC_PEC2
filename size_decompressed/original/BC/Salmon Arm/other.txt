I looked up to scan the sky to see what I may see, always hoping to see something of interest, when I saw what I thought was a large bird at about 500 feet which looked to be the size of a condor or larger silently soaring in a straight line from South to North.   I watched it expecting it to either flap its wings or change direction slightly but it did not deviate from its course and was traveling too fast to be a bird.  It continued on a perfectly straight trajectory until it was out of sight.   Was it a drone or something else.  I am sure it was not a bird.;50.7033;-119.2683
