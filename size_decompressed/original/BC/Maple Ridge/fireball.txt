Orange fireball sighted while watching eclipse;2015-09-27 21:00:00;1.5 mins;Orange fireball sighted while watching eclipse While watching the eclipse the fireball appeared coming in from the north east as in the path of a plane that is normally seen from our yard.  Except that it was a very big bright orange light.  No sound.   It came closer and closer and then changed direction to the east away from us and then the light flickered a bit and got smaller and then bigger a few times before going out completely.  I could still see it as a tiny black dot and followed it until it went down behind some trees.;49.2300563909774;-122.581777443609
