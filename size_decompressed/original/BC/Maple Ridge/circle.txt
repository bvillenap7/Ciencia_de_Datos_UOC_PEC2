Green and blue lights over Maple Ridge, BC;2007-09-05 22:00:00;1 hour approx.;Green and blue lights over Maple Ridge, BC We heard commotion outside which was our neighbour and his 2 kids very excited about 2 circular objects in the clear sky. One was green and the other was blue. My neighbour said that he was walking home from a friends place and these 2 objects were moving in the same direction as he was, but at a really fast pace, like a plane, if not faster. They both stopped right above our house and we watched them for about an hour. They were moving back and forth, sometimes circling each other and sometimes not moving at all. They were about the same height as the stars. After a while they seemed to be getting higher and then they just disappeared.
