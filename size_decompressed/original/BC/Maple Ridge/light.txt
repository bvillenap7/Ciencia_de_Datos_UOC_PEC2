Two Bright Orange Lights in Evening Sky.;2015-02-17 20:30:00;10 minutes;Two Bright Orange Lights in Evening Sky Around 8:30 pm Wednesdy evening, looking south-southeast, my wife noticed two bright orange objects moving slowly from east to west approximately 1 to 2 miles away from her at an approximate altitude of 2500 feet.   She called me to come and see what I could make of it and my two children aged 11 and 14 also came outside to witness the objects.  When I arrived outside one of the orange lights had suddenly just disappeared whereas the one remaining orange light slowly moved east and then very slowly faded away.   There were several (3) low flying aircraft also in the area during this event (Cessna variety), and at one point my wife stated that the two objects looked like they were attempting to follow the aircraft.   I had suggested that the two objects could have been homemade Chinese lanterns, as it is close to the Chinese New Year, but to be honest they did seem to be very strange.   Also while out walking with a neighbour today, my wife says that the neighbour saw the same lights, and that she does not think they were chinese lanterns.   Anyhow thought I would post what we saw and see if anyone else had the same experience.;49.2300563909774;-122.581777443609
