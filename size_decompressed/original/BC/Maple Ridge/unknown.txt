Red lights in the sky;2013-03-27 20:45:00;<3-4 minutes;Red lights in the sky. I was walking with my girlfriend to the gas station at 845, when i heard her say &quotwhat are those things up there?&quot i looked up and saw a collection of four red lights, too big to be stars, rising upward. They glowed brightly and were spaced apart what i would measure on my fingers if i held them up, two inches apart. Similar to a constellation they held in formation essentially, just weaving side to side in tiny little movements. The four lights were in almost a right angle triangle, hypotenous on the left, and one more above the triangle. I called my mom immediately because this looked the same as some things id seen on the internet. I told her &quotlook UFO! UFO!&quot and they started flickering and vanishing from top to bottom. One by one all of them dissapeared. Not long after i saw what appeared to be an army jet fly over my porch toward were the lights were. I was looking southwest from Maple Ridge, BC Canada, when i saw them, the whole thing lasted maybe four minutes in total. I dont know what it was, but im nervous.;49.2300563909774;-122.581777443609
Beams of light shooting in random directions coming from an unknown small orb.;2013-08-03 03:30:00;~20-30 minutes;Beams of light shooting in random directions coming from an unknown small orb Strange flashing beams of light in clear night sky coming from small glowing orb (slightly larger than most stars) Light beams went in random directions, in no particular pattern.  Object that they came from moved in fast zig-zags, then the lights stopped, & the object moved extremely fast upwards, stopped, & then vanished. No sound from the object was heard. This occurred over my 5.3 acre forested property.  The object was overtop of the forest, far from the road. (Previous report from West Kelowna, BC, describes a very similar occurrence.  Both locations are fairly close to each other). Note:  There is an aircraft training route that passes over my house, but they have never tested aircraft at night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));49.2300563909774;-122.581777443609

First saw 4 orange lights low moving together at plane speed or faster, with a 5th lagging behind to my left 120 degrees South/East.  The 4 flying together disappeared into possible cloud cover but never re-appeared.  Then 5th lagging disappeared same direction moments later. Took pics as best I could, then sat back down.  1 min later 4 more appeared coming from the same area moving together Orange/red in colour , all crafts were flashing here and there.  Disappearing and shining again.   Took more pics and watched them disappear exactly the same as the others.  I took the pictures using an iPhone 5 s.  They look light in photos and streetlight and trees made it harder to get a good picture. Hoping someone else in the area saw them and maybe got a better view. I have never posted or seen anything worth reporting before. Thanks;49.2300563909774;-122.581777443609
