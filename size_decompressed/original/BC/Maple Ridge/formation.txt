I live in Maple Ridge which is a small community outside of Vancouver BC Canada.  At approx. 12:45 a.m., Aug. 13, I was sitting outside watching the meteor shower and from the corner of my eye I thought I saw the flash of a meteor.  I turned my head and quickly realized that it wasn't a meteor as there was no tail or burn-out.  My next thought was that it was a satelite.  I immediately realized that what I was looking at was too bright, travelling far too fast and too low to be a satelite.  I saw 3 bright white  orbs flying quickly and silently in unison across the sky!    They moved southwest to northeast and left no tail in their wake.  Immediately after they went by I heard 3 faint clicks that sounded like electricity crackle and then they were gone.  I have never in my life seen anything move so fast or so quietly through the sky.  I followed the objects until the roof of my house got in the way!  In total I watched these bright orbs for approximately 5 seconds.  I am an average middle aged woman who does not smoke, drink or do drugs!  I am in shock and in awe of what I have seen tonite,;49.2300563909774;-122.581777443609
