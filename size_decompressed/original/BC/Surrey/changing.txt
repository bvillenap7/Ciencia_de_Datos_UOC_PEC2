Morphing? Interdimensional Craft - Daylight Sighting;1995-06-26 16:00:00;1/2 hour;Morphing? Interdimensional Craft - Daylight Sighting While  a friend and I were sitting on the bank of the Fraser River at Surrey, BC, he looked up and remarked on what he thought, initially, were large seagulls overhead.  They were instead very large craft with globular bellies that reflected sun light -- like a very white/bright metal.  There were six to eight of them flying overhead which I estimate to be about a mile above us.  The wings were flapping but not like seagulls which flap in unison.  When I remarked about this to my friend, then they changed to flap in unison.  We had seagulls flying in front of us over the river, so it was easy to compare.  These craft at times flew in a loose formation, then aimlessly.  The strangest parts were I had the  impression that our thoughts were being picked from overhead.  And they disappeared and REappeared -- against blue sky.  These were solid craft, sharply seen -- but they seemed to disappear and they reappear against blue sky -- as if they were going in and out of another dimension.  We watched them until we got bored -- went into the fish shop for the fish boat had come in and then left.  I reported this incident to the Canadian UFO reporting center at Vancouver, B.C. and the then president who called me back told me had a similar sighting, also over the Fraser River some weeks before -- but only one craft -- and no where near as many as we had seen.  This was a day time sighting, and one we watched long enough to be clear as to what we saw.;49.1257968438533;-122.805839202657
UFO CHANGES SHAPES AND COLORS AND SPLIT INTO TWO WITH SOUND. ((NUFORC Note:  Aircraft landing, we believe.  PD));2012-01-17 02:00:00;10-15 minutes;UFO CHANGES SHAPES AND COLORS AND SPLIT INTO TWO WITH SOUND ((NUFORC Note:  Aircraft landing, we believe.  PD)) Dear Researchers,  I am contacting you with a request to kindly review the video I took of a possible UFO on Jan 17, 2012. I have the original video in my camcorder and we can arrange to view it directly from my video camera as well if we meet.  I never believed on UFO's until this encounter and initially I thought it is some sort of Government aircraft but when I review the video with 1/4th speed and also frame by frame, it blew my brains to see what I describe as a FACE and full figure being with clear view to the object. I live on a 14th floor facing East, from where I can see Mountain Baker*(Washington State). On Jan 17, 2012 at around 2 am I noticed very bright light in the sky traveling from southeast to southwest and thought a plane is heading West to land *(Pearson Intl' Airport) Vancouver, BC. But the light was hovering for at least a minute before I got my Video Camera out to capture this video.  Please log on to you tube* (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUAeIV7TmOk)  to view the  video.   I strongly request to view it in a slow motion *(1/4 th ) speed and if possible view it frame by frame.  You will be able to see a FACE with visible eyes,mouth and nose and what appear is a HORN on the left side of the face stretching from head to chin around jaw line, when the object change color to red and it is a closeup shot.  You will also notice the object change into two at the end and also the ability to expand??  I am just unable to explain in words.;49.1257968438533;-122.805839202657
