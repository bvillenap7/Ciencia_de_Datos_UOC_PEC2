Disc fleet over Surrey BC Canada;2009-02-27 17:30:00;5 min;Disc fleet over Surrey BC There was one solid disc (not illuminated) flying south on a north-south heading directly overhead, making no sound.  It was underneath some light fair weather cumulus.   I watched it go southbound until it was out of sight - it did not accelerate or change altitude, estimated speed 250-350 knots based on the speed of the jet that the fleet described below was following.   About two minutes later on the same heading there was a fleet of identical objects headed south, it was not packed into one tight formation it was spread out so there were groups of two or three craft in formation.  The lead object in the fleet was tailing an airline jet on the same heading by about one mile.  The objects made no sound and emitted no light however I did notice a 'fuzzy' aura around them.  Based on the size of the aircraft and the fair weather clouds, I would estimate that the objects were about 3000 feet altitude and approximately 30  to 50 feet in diameter.   I tried counting the craft but lost count at around 8.   I was trying to focus on viewing one group, when another group would fly into my field of vision, confusing my counting. I also noticed cross-traffic, an airline jet crossed overhead higher than the cloud and higher than the fleet at about the same time. Yesterday was one day when I really wish I had my camera, I could have taken really good pictures, probably could have taken closeups with my zoom. The objects were all headed directly south towards the border. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate a date of the sighting.
