My first thought we are being invaded by something.  I ran in grabbed my daughter who had just gone to bed I knew I would never be able to explain this she ran out.  She was like WTF is this?  We watched them all of a sudden they started moving outwards on their own and just disappeared except for 2 that moved around and stayed for a few minutes until they disappeared.  I believe this was something out of our world.  There is no way anything like that could have lined up like that.;49.1257968438533;-122.805839202657
