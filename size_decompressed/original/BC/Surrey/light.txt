Five bright lights in the sky flying in various formations for about 20 minutes.;1996-06-15 22:00:00;15-20 minutes;Five bright lights in the sky flying in various formations for about 20 minutes. I was on my way home from a night class. It was a very clear night, when I had parked in the driveway I sat on my car hood to watch the stars for awhile before I went in for the night, To the north I noticed 5 lights roughly the same height as a plane landing at Vancouver international airport. The lights with a bright white color and basically looked like stars, with a difference. These five lights moved in unison for left to right, In a zig-zag pattern. Would make sudden stops and quickly start moving again, They would form a line or go into a pattern formation. This lasted for about 15-20 minutes. At that point they flew in what I would assume in a direction leaving the atmosphere and disappeared. The following morning on a local radio station a dicussion was going on with callers and the DJ about what people had seen the night before. The DJ had video taped the event and at a later date I did see it on the show Sightings along with an interview with that DJ. From the distance of these lights to my home I would assume they would have been over the Fraser River. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

My boyfriend and i  witnessed a bright flash of light followed by a rumble on June 3  ((NUFORC Note:  Dramatic meteor.  PD));2004-06-03 02:40:00;seconds;My boyfriend and i  witnessed a bright flash of light followed by a rumble on June 3 In the early morning hours of June 3 i awoke because my boyfriend had been unable to sleep and was downstairs.  I was concerned because he was gone a long time and rarely gets up in the middle of the night.  I had opened my eyes and was about to head downstairs when i saw a very bright flash coming through the small window above my head.  I waited to hear a car backing up as i assumed it had driven in our driveway.  There was NO NOISE and it was eerily quiet.  I instinctively looked at the clock which read 2:40 am which is very out of character for me.  IN my head i heard that its important to note the time.  Then i started getting worried because i thought of an alien ship and my boyfriends previous encounters with things unexplained.  So i raced downstairs half expecting him not to be there.  He was at the foot of the stairs which made me jump.  I asked him if he saw the light and he said yes. Then we both heard a rumble and he exclaimed that it was probably thunder and lightening. I didn't believe that it was lightening since it was too bright.  Intuitively i felt that it was much more than a meteor when i heard about it the next day.  Inexplicably i have been trying to find out more information which would satisfy me...i have become rather obsessed i'm afraid. I'm a contemporary ((type deleted)) artist, female ((fifties)) years old with a degree in ((social sciences)) my boyfriend is a ((exotic construction)) expert and is ((forties)) years old.

Star like moving away at high speed.;2004-07-15 21:30:00;2 minutes;Star like moving away at high speed. I was BBQing on the back patio of my home in North Surrey British Columbia.  I am an avid sky watcher and know the Northern skies fairly well. It was just after sunset. As I walked onto the patio I became immediately aware of what appeared to be a star in the corner of my eye.  I thought to myself, &quotthat does not belong there&quot. I turned and looked directly at it.  It looked every bit like an ordinary star.  It was in the northern sky about 30 degrees above the horizon.  It's distance I cannot say, but I had the impression it was quite far away.  I watched it for perhaps ten seconds and then it began to move away from my position in a north easterly direction at about 45 degrees to the horizon. It moved across about 30 degrees of the sky accelerating very quickly until it disappeared. It did not change in size or color.  There was no sound.  Approximately a minute later I looked above me and saw a collection of bright red lights, round, sitting in one spot flashing on and off in a seemingly random fashion.  For some reason, and I do not understand why,  I attributed no significance to the red lights and walked back in the house.  I was, however, quite struck by the star like object.  I am very convinced to this day, and again I do not know why, that the star like object knew I was there and was aware that I was watching it.  My background is quite average.  I am working stiff, a tour bus driver at the time.  I do not drink or do drugs.  I was completely sober and had all my faculties with me at the time.

Two bright lights moving and changing color in the sky's above Vancouver;2005-08-01 22:35:00;2.5 hours;Two bright lights moving and changing color in the sky's above Vancouver At about 10:35pm August 1st 2005, I had steped outside for a cigarette when I noticed a bright light in the north sky. It was changing colors and moving in many different directions. It hovered for about one minute and then moved. It continued to do this for about an hour. It then vanished. About 30 seconds later it was back. I then noticed in the east sky, another light. This one seemed to be bigger and brighter than the other. It hovered and moved just like the other object. Both lights are still in the sky, moving about as I write this. It is now 12:46am on August 2nd.;49.1257968438533;-122.805839202657
bright white later yellow and blue light hovering over Fraser River for several hours from Surrey, Canada;2006-07-28 22:00:00;hours;bright white later yellow and blue light hovering over Fraser River for several hours from Surrey, Canada On Friday July 28 my wife and I were loking through our west facing window towards Vancouver from Surrey, over the Fraser River.  We noticed a highly powerful bright white glowing ball.  We got out the binoculars and was able to view 4 balls tightly compacted.  The light appreared to hover for at least 1/ hour before I alerted the neighbors who agreed that the light(s) were very unusual.  Upon further viewing the lights slowly moved N.W. and grew smaller.  We thought it would go away but within 15 minutes it came back to it's original location where the balls began to turn yellow, green, blueish purple.  It stayed hovering for so long that we finally decided to go to bed at 01:00.  The following morning a neighbor (that we did not speak with the night before, came by and brought up the strange light of the prior evening.

There was a bright light in the night sky, moving at sharp angles in a predictable rectangular path.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));2009-01-23 21:00:00;30+ minutes;There was a bright light in the night sky, moving at sharp angles in a predictable rectangular path. Between 8-9 pm I first observed a bright light in the sky from my bedroom window.  It was a little brighter than a star, but not much larger.  From my location it was about a 40 degree angle from the horizon in the SW sky, more southerly than westerly.  In relation to the nearby trees, I watched this light move in a straight line SW of its southerly/westerly location, and then abruptly veer upwards for about 5 minutes, then move in a straight line in an easterly direction, again for about 5 minutes.  It hung stationary for a few minutes, and then moved downwoards to approximately its original location, and began the same manouver again.  I also watched it do the same thing from a vantage point on a road nearby, with a tree branch as a reference to its movement.  There were airplanes in the sky, passing by, as well as a helicopter, and the light did not look like either of those possibilities. I reported this the the Surrey RCMP, who made out a report.  I also saw this similar light tonight, but could not watch for long, since I was driving. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));49.1257968438533;-122.805839202657

Bright pink flare-like lights floating down from sky - Two different occasions in Surrey.;2011-11-13 22:50:00;5 seconds;Bright pink flare-like lights floating down from sky - Two different occasions in Surrey. First:  Driving home from a late dinner in Surrey, me and my girlfriend spotted a bright pink flare-like light (possibly was a flare?) falling from the sky. Second:  Different location in surrey, around 80th ave and 140th we saw yet another bright pink flare-like light falling from the sky, this time we tried to chase it before it fell behind the tree line to see if its just kids shooting a flare gun or something but we drove the streets around the area and didnt see anything that stood out.   Just would like others to post if they have seen these recently too?  They are extremely bright and noticeable but nothing to say if they are extraterrestrial or not.

Satellite changed direction while I watched;2021-08-29 22:00:00;5 minutes;Satellite changed direction while I watched I was out in the field with my daughters star gazing. When I see a satellite moving from west to east. I started to show them the light moving and let them know it’s a satellite. But it slowed down and then stopped. I never seen anything like it before in my life. And I’m a Canadian Army Vet, skydiver, and lived on air bases in my youth. But here’s where it really made me go wow this is something very different. That’s when a second “satellite” moved from north to south crossing the path of the one that stopped. Then second one kept going while the first one then moved south east. The satellite changed direction! Never seen that before in my life. My daughters could see it but they are just 10 and 7 so they don’t really know what they were looking at;49.1257968438533;-122.805839202657
