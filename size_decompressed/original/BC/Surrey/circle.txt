In my apartment we have a roof garden on the 17th floor which gives us a full view in all directions. At 21:10, I was standing outside on the roof garden enjoying the night air. When I looked to the south, I saw a bright green fireball coming out of nowhere and descent fairly slow and dissappear in midair. There was no sonic boom or explosion or any smoke afterwards.The object had a reddish coloured tail. It was circular and appeared to be aproximately the size of a car but round. I was the only person standing on the roof garden when this occured.I am a Licensed Practical Nurse by trade and was off duty this particular night.;49.1257968438533;-122.805839202657
UFO's in Surrey? I Wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it for myself!;2004-11-25 19:00:00;40 seconds;UFO's in Surrey? I Wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it for myself! It was a bright light in the sky, it was hovering over the ground not sure how far but pretty high up. The it slowly dissapeared and a blue cloud in the shape of a U appeared where the light was, then it dissapeared. Please note that I am writing this on behalf of my 12 year old Son, normally I don't believe in these things (having never seen one) what was so convincing is how excited he was along with the youth worker (Ministry of Children and Family Services) I thought the two of them couldn't have possibly seen the same thing, if it was all made up! Just wondering if anyone else perhaps spotted this?;49.1257968438533;-122.805839202657
Suspicious lights seen in Surrey this morning.;2019-10-29 07:00:00;20 minutes;Suspicious lights seen in Surrey this morning. The morning of 29th Oct when it's still dark at this time of year after getting up and dropping my curtains of my rooms noticed 4 lights floating in the Sky, they were seen diagonally floating in-line with each other and not moving at all. Living in high-rise buildings especially on 24th floor the view was very clear. At first I thought they are flights taking off but when I zoomed my camera  I was they were actual lights just floating in the sky. One of the lights was deemed after sometime and then eventually all the 4 lights disappeared around 7:33am. I am still not sure if this is some kind of float lamps, just wanted to report this unusual objects seen in sky today morning. I also have a picture of it if we can attach those.;49.1257968438533;-122.805839202657

They were seen diagonally floating in-line with each other and not moving at all. Living in high-rise buildings especially on 24th floor the view was very clear.

I noticed at first 3 lights flying above me at slow speed. Then i noticed 8 more behind them.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-12 05:00:00;15 minutes;This morning around 5 am i was smoking out i noticed at first 3 lights flying above me at slow speed.  Then i noticed 8 more behind them all same speed and distance.  Bright round light, then i noticed 3 other objects in a triangle formation behind other objects.  I kind of afraid so i called my daughters bf to look at the sky. we noticed more in a straight line behind i would say 14 - 15 objects already.  He said those are planes. I express how is that possible too many one after another and no sound.  I have heard planes flying greater heights many times before and i can clearly hear engine roaring.  This group of objects make any sound. He left but i continued to keep watching, when i notice approximately another 5 behind the 15 - 16 except 1 object flow in a different direction north west same speed. The others were going the same speed same distance apart all the same size heading from south towards north east. I started thinking they possibly maybe be satell! ites. But i started feeling scared at that point and went inside.  After 20 minutes or so i was curious if the objects were still visible.  Unfortunately the sky was brighter and could see any more lights or objects.  Hopefully others witness this event this morning.  What i did realized is the speed they all were traveling is same as plane normally except the absence of sound.  Last thoughts is why would 30 or more planes be flying in that formation??  I wished i continued watching!!;49.1257968438533;-122.805839202657
