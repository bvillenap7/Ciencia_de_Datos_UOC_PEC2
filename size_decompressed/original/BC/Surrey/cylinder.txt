Crazy sighting.;2012-01-16 23:00:00;30 seconds;crazy sighting we live right near the airport and we were outsite smoking when i heard a loud noise but it didnt sound like a normal plane and all of a sudden this big white thing with no wings or lights or any sign of an engine flew over us, slow enough that we got up and followed it to the far side of the yard as it disipeared behind the trees.  I have never seen anything in the air other than planes and birds, nothing like this. it almost looked like a rocket ship but on its side, and really loud. the engine of this was not anything like a normal plane, we hear the planes all day and this was not a plane.;49.1257968438533;-122.805839202657
