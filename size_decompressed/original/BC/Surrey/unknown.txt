Blue crown light formation over Burnaby.;2016-07-03 01:30:00;10 minutes;Blue crown light  formation over burnaby On July 3, 2016, at approximately 1:30am, an intense blueish VOILET light was seen shining from within the clouds over Burnaby.  I live in Surrey.   I was getting up to open my window, when I encountered these strange lights in the sky.  I counted a total number of 8 lights, shaped in a crown like formation.  The light was bright, but didn't seem to be coming from a spotlight down below.  There was no traceable light that was visible from its origin if it were to be coming from the ground.    If I had to pinpoint a place of origin, I would say it was coming from within the clouds, shining outwards.  This event lasted about ten minutes, throughout which the lights seemed to turn on and off in a randomized pattern.   This event was also witnessed and filmed by a lady in the Guildford area, she posted  the video on YouTube under,  Ufo?  Blue lights sighting @ Vancouver, BC  1:30am July 3, 2016   I haven't heard of any other reports from this event.  No Facebook posts, no news articles.  I'm not sure if the RCMP was ever contacted.  Not sure if there's anyone else who might have seen this.;49.1257968438533;-122.805839202657
