It looked like a hazey straight line that went extremly quick than disapeared over the mountain in a blink almost. I went to a park with some friends and I looked up and I saw this silver colored stripe that was hazey flying downwards towards distant mountains. It was traveling  very quickly. This all happened in a squence of 2 to 4 seconds. This exprience goes down in my head like ink on paper!;49.1257968438533;-122.805839202657
Strange Planes That Changed Shape And Appear To Be Interdimensional;1996-06-20 15:30:00;30 minutes plus;Strange Planes That Changed Shape And Appear To Be Interdimensional That afternoon a friend and I went down to the river (Campbell) where the fishing boats came in to get fresh fish for dinner.  We arrived early so I sat on a log waiting for the boats to come in.  This spot was a brief walk from the highway, perhaps 400 ft or so from the road.  My friend sat on the sand, leaning back on the log looking at the sky. He caught my attention by saying, “Look at those strange seagulls up there.”  I looked up and saw five to six ‘planes’ that had a strange shape, bulbous middles apparently white metal for the sun was glinting off of them.  The time may have been an hour later, like 4:30, come to think of it for the sun was low in the sky.  It was a clear day with few clouds in the sky. These planes were more than a mile high by my estimation and way too large to be birds, to appear as large as they did from our vantage point down below.  Further, the metal wings were moving alternately.  “Those can’t be birds – they are too large. Those are planes! Look at the shape,” I said.  ““Gulls are streamlined, don’t have bulging, round middles.”  “And gulls flap their wings in unison. Just as I said that, the planes began moving their wings in unison, as gulls do.  I know it sounds strange, but he and I both remarked that we felt as if our brains were being scanned and picked, our thoughts being read. We continued watching these “planes” flying aimlessly back and forth above us in the sky.  If their shape were not unusual enough, from time to time one or more would “disappear” – against blue sky.  And then reappear.  We got the impression that somehow they were going to and from another dimension. I reported this bizarre sighting to the UFO reporting group in British Columbia, Canada.  Their president returned my call and asked me many questions about the sighting and my personal background and history.  I do legal investigative work for lawyers and am not known for lapses of consciousness or imbibing any mind altering substance, by the way.  If my friend had not seen the same things in the sky, I might not have reported it.  The president of the society confirmed that he, too, had seen such planes over the Campbell River in Surrey while walking his dog.  But he saw just one, not five or six as we had seen.  When I told him of our impression that these were going back and forth between dimensions, he said that was a good possibility from the way they vanished, almost dissolving against the blue sky – and then reappearing. There is no doubt we saw what we saw in this long daylight sighting.;49.1257968438533;-122.805839202657
