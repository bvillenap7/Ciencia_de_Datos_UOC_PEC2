(Djice9) A guy on my myspace, kept talking of Yahweh .... said he has seen craft and that this is the creator of the Bible. I humoured him and asked him to do a vid, he did. Here it is for reference:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3U6s9JCly4  Here is some other guy....  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLFdGEOftMo  Any way, he got deleted off of myspace after posting that. He later contacted me and said I can do this .... just offer a pure and simple prayer and he (Yahweh) will show. I am not that religious, but did go as far as verifying that yes this was the original name in the Bible YHYH.  So first night, I said a prayer and felt like a nut, I finished my beer and went inside. What am I doing I Thought....  The next morning, some almond eye'ed people came to my door and wanted to read from the Bible. They were not Jehovah's but something different... Elohim something....  They read from a NIV Bible and it was something about Israel from the sky. Their look was different two women, one extraordinary beautiful. So I was happy to chat longer...  So thinking this was some Internet Cult or a weird coincidence that night I said the prayer again to check this out. I did see, orbs and flashes the first night. I could not believe it, I saw Yahweh?  Next night, summer, I just had to see one more time, another simple prayer, pure and true.... 3 minutes or so a huge flash and another orb. OMG!  I don't know what to make of it, it changed my life. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));49.1257968438533;-122.805839202657
