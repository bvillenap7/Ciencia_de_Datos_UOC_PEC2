Me and 2 friends were star grazing at the sky of surrey out on our front street at Approx. 9:40, when a larger,as we though of a star about the size of a dime at the usuall altutude a airliner would fly at, from where we were standing. They object stood stationary for sevral minutes while I went into to get my Game Boy camera and a film camera and took 2 pictures on my gameboy camera(it made the gameboy camera zoom in even ya know that it doesn't have a zoom lens) and 1 on my film camera which did not come out well (it looked like a blothy red spot). At this time it was still stationary about 30 seconds later the object moved from SOUTH to NORTH at a extremly fast speed covering miles of the sky in seconds. Then we noticed that the object had stoped and about 2 or 3 aircrafts chased it as it made a flash then disappered into thin air. Then it apeared as 7 lights in a circle for a split second then disappered once again The object was roundish maybe oval, a turquoise colour to a whitish yellow at the flash, Approx the size of a 747 but in an oval shape but had no tips or ends, it was a stream line shape on the sides making an oval. I have 2 pictures of it;49.1257968438533;-122.805839202657

Heard a sound too.  It was moving bright light.  Seemed like someone try to communicate, but I got scared and made myself hide in my blanket.  And it went away.   I felt stupid so I didn't talk about it to anyone until I read this blog.   People are reporting to saw something I have seen too, but it was in my bedroom, that is the only difference.;49.1257968438533;-122.805839202657
