Three lights in triangle shape;2004-04-07 21:45:00;4 seconds;Three lights in triangle shape At 9:45 Pm tonight (April 7th) I was admiring the beautiful clear starry night after putting my daughter to bed I was looking Westward. Three lights rapidly approached from the West in a triangle formation, at '12 o'clock low'.  I watched them closely to make sure that I wasn't looking at birds or something else. I am inferring that the object between the lights was solid and triangular, because when the object banked North, the angular relationship between the lights was consistent with the banking of an aircraft - however this was no ordinary aircraft. It moved completely silently and covered half the horizon, that is from Surrey to the North Shore Mountains in about four seconds. I am guessing the altitude (based on watching approaching aircraft in the same airspace at 2000 - 3000 f, and the brightness of the lights of the object relative to the brightness of passing aircraft lights) at within 7000 feet. My gut feeling while watching this thing was that it could not be man-made I was also admiring the technology that could create something with this kind of performance envelope. Amazing! I continued to watch the sky for about a half an hour afterwards I noted that the flight path of the object was directly over the approach path to YVR, and that at 21:55 an aircraft approached through the same airspace. I tried to sketch this out on paper, but the sketch doesn't do justice to the way this thing banked and moved.
