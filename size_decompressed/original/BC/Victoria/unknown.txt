Near the building where I live there is a open feild that I go to to just sit and watch the stars. As I was looking up I noticed something that was on fire steaking from left to righ through the sky... The object appeared to be metal as it was metalic appreance as well as losing bits of itself as it went down. I only saw it for approx ten seconds could have been satilite..Object then disapeared.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
bright white light with black outline around it moving soundlessly and slowly from north banking east and disappearing upward.;2002-10-10 19:45:00;2 minutes approx;bright white light with black outline around it moving soundlessly and slowly from north banking east and disappearing upward. Very bright white light moving from north and banking to eastward with no sound and using binoculars could see dark shape visible around white light it disappeared into the sky rather than flew away.  Not a satellite, meteor or shooting star.  Those don't change direction and no flashing lights like a plane and it flew directly overhead.  Helicopter flew low from east to west shortly after.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
Saw bright large light 2000 feet,Juan de Fuca strait,4 miles south of Victoria Dissappeared with out moving;2006-10-12 18:30:00;< 2 minutes;Saw bright large light 2000 feet,Juan de Fuca strait,4 miles south of Victoria Dissappeared with out moving While looking south of my balcony,yesterday evening.Saw stationary light in sky. Was about 3-4 miles south south east ,maybe 2000 feet. At first  i thought it was a plane .But they usually have a little strobe or a flashing red light. What made this different to me  was the fact that it was so BRIGHT.And   it was blinking{i believe,yes , this is what grabbed my eye,slow blinking ,i recall}.Then  it totally dissappeared. It was not normal . It was gone before my neighbour could see it . I am so mad that i didn't jump on my binoculars when first saw this. Maybe it was the setting sun doing a number ,but i don't believe that.  Maybe some one else saw it. On my word ((name deleted));48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
Coloured lights over the Juan de Fuca Straits.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius??  PD));2011-01-02 21:00:00;Indefinite - watched it f;Coloured lights over the Juan de Fuca Straits In the south-south-east sky perhaps over the Strait of Juan de Fuca or the Olympic Peninsula, visible from both Victoria BC and from Saanichton BC, some 20 miles north.  Couldn't guess the altitude but it was near enough to see the colour changes quite distinctly.  Changing colours rapidly - white, green, red, amber, pink, blue and yellow.  Looks like a Christmas ornament as the colours flashed in and out.  Hovering, but doesnâ€™t seem to be moving in the sky any more than a star would.   Atmospherics?   We saw something identical some months ago and reported it.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
