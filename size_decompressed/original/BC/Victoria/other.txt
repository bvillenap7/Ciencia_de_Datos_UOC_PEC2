((NUFORC Note:  We wonder if the witnesses have ruled out high-flying migratory birds.  However, migratory birds should be in their traditional nesting areas by June.

A few repeated, multi-coloured streaks of light in an apparently south-easterly direction;1999-09-02 00:15:00;seconds (repeated);A few repeated, multi-coloured streaks of light in an apparently south-easterly direction Around midnight PST (Thursday), my friend and I had decided to go searching for some of our other buds who were supposed to meet up w/ us. We decided to check a favourite meeting spot. It is a cliff that overlooks the Strait of Georgia between Vancouver Island and the mainland. The area is isolated and high up from city lights so visiblility of the night sky is fairly good. As soon as our eyes became adjusted after exiting the car to look for our friends, my attention was diverted to the sky where I glimpsed a red streak of light travel south-easterly extremely rapidly. The streak of light was very long in covering a distance approximately a quarter of the night sky. The streak of light was not large in length. After the streak had dissapeared, subsequent differently coloured streaks were observed travelling in a similar direction but originating in a position west of the original streak. We thought that our eyes were decieving us until I heard the reports on Art Bell's ra! dio program. Brilliant show! The streaks and the radio program!;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  City bus size flying tube.;2000-08-15 03:00:00;10 minutes;City bus size flying tube. A  witness reported looking out his window and seeing an unusual object at approx: 3:00 a.m. near the Oak Bay Junction, where Oak Bay Avenue meets Fort Street and Pandora Street. The fellow said there is a hill, which is at the highest point in the city on Belmont Avenue. On the hill there is a large condo complex which is 12 to 14 stories in height. On top of the complex there are microwave and cell phone towers. From the witnesses position, looking toward the condo complex he saw a strange object flying close to the top of the complex. (He said if people would have been looking out there windows they would have had this object pass right in front of their faces). He described the object as looking like an ordinary florescent tube, square on both ends, maybe slightly rounded (ends) and a pale yellow orange glow in color.  It was traveling in a flat trajectory and just zipped by, traveling at an incredible rate of speed right at the top of the building. The witness noted the same object passed by the building twice within ten minutes in exactly the same spot. At this point he said his heart was thumping rather hard due to what he just saw. Each time the object was noticed the sighting lasted maybe for about 2 seconds. He figured it was approx: the length of a city bus.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

Space debris momentarily light up in sky over Victoria B.C.;2002-11-29 00:19:00;3 seconds;Space debris momentarily light up in sky over Victoria B.C. Four to five white lights that appeared as a break up of some sort went north over Victoria, British Columbia at 12:19 Friday morning. They were so close that at first I thought they were a low flying jet going over the top of the hotel, but immediately realized that the lights were irregular, all bright white and some left a faint streaking in the sky. They went over the top of the hotel, 90 degrees, and blinked out at about 60 degrees northerly. I feel certain that the cluster was a break up of some space vehicle (satellite, rocket etc), it was reminiscent of the debris that came over Seattle some years ago that created quite a stir. However, there's a chance that it could have been meteoroids, but I've spent many hours observing meteor showers with some real close ones(one even exploded over my head and made an explosive sound and left a cloud that sat in the air where it exploded for over 10 minutes), and this was bigger than any of those spectacular meteors, and the fact that it was all in a cluster moving at the same speed and in the same direction, suggests to me some sort of space debris re-entering earth's atmosphere.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524

There is no way she could have doctored this or changed this image in any way.  Though she uses a computer, its only for email and to store and send photos using iphoto.  She's pretty clueless as when it comes to technology.  This is the view from her street, in front of her building.  A big storm had just passed and she thought the sky looked really pretty so she took a picture.  The object is clearly visible.  It kind of looks like a donut or possibly a life preserver.  Its definately not a plane or a bird and it doesnt look like any cloud ive ever seen.  She did not notice it until she looked at the picture later.

A moving glow from something above a cloud over Victoria, BC.;2016-11-21 23:15:00;10 minutes;A moving glow from something above a cloud over Victoria From 9th. floor balcony overlooking the city, I observed a glow in a heavy cloud that hung over it.  The glow moved at intervals, breaking through where the cloud was less dense, in a back and forth line of travel of about two miles.  The glow was not bright or colored.  How many times it traversed the two mile course, I could not say for sure, probably half a dozen.  There was nothing apparent from the city that could have caused it (eg beam of light) besides, it was definitely above the cloud.  There were no aircraft type noises. It disappeared after about ten minutes, but obviously the phenomena could have been in motion before I entered the balcony.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
Multple sightings of slow-moving colored lights in night sky with one descent of red arced light to ground;2020-01-24 19:30:00;less than 2 hours;Multple sightings of slow-moving colored lights in night sky with one descent of red arced light to ground I and other residents of the house have seen an odd light formation in the sky, to the south east of Portage Road (near Portage Inlet), north of Victoria, Vancouver Island, BC.  First sighting was January 16, 2020, I think. Since then it's recurred on at least three occasions, most recently the 19th and 20th of February. Time was generally between 7.30 PM to just after 9 PM. Then again March 21 in the morning around 5.30 AM.  It looked like a bright star to the naked eye, but lower then a star it drifted back and forth slowly, from east to further south. It seemed to be some distance away it was framed behind a tall pine tree's upper branches and gradually moved from one side of the tree to the other very slowly, often over about 30 minutes before moving out of view.  It was not a star: Looking at it through binoculars, it seemed to resolve into a cluster of red, white and green lights spaced short distances apart, possibly in a triangular or oval shape. However, it was too far away to see details or estimate the actual distance of the object.  No sounds were audible.  The same area of sky, viewed in daylight, appears to be empty of buildings, utility poles or towers that might be illuminated at night.  Another family member saw on Feb 20th what appeared to be a bright white light banded by a curving oval swath of red light detach from the main star-like shape and descend in an arc earthwards in a space of 10-15 seconds, at which point the descending curved light disappeared. (The cluster of other colored lights remained in the sky for another hour or so). The descent may have taken place in the Colquitz Creek / Admirals Road/Cuthbert Holmes Park area.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
