A bright green fireball witnessed by my son and I at around 9:10pm local time;1998-09-23 21:10:00;5 seconds;A bright green fireball witnessed by my son and I at around 9:10pm local time As we drove down the Pat Bay Highway, north of Victoria, at around 9:10 pm local time we witnessed one bright green fireball, approximate size - 1/4 moon, streak across the sky in an east to west direction over the Olympic Mts. The fireball was on a slightly downward course for the duration of time in which the object was visible (5 seconds). It disappeared in what seemed to be mid-air. There were no viewing obstructions as the particular area was flat farm land. There was a long white tail following the object. From past experiences witnessing meteorites we are quite positive in saying that the object seen tonight was not such space debris. I am a government employee with the B.C Ministry of Forests (Victoria branch) and I am currently the president of our local soccer association. My son is 19 years old and currently employed with a local restaurant. I am 48. I hope this is helpful.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
Fireballs seen over Vancouver Island.;2005-01-25 00:32:00;30 seconds;Fireballs seen over Vancouver Island. I was out on my south facing deck, having a cigarette. I looked up at Jupiter, only to see due east of jupiter, in the southwestern sky, I watched something that could have been a rocket firetrail heading in a a southwest direction away from Victoria. I called out my room mates boyfriend to see waht I was looking at. We both watched two smaller fireballs flash brightly then both fell, one on each side of the craft. To me it looked like when the space shuttle takes off and then drops its solid fuel boosters. The third trail of fire just kept going and faded off into the night sky. I figuree it was some form of rocket, but is was after midnight, and odd time to do any missile testing, and what kind of military craft drops two rockets off, and where could this have taken off from...???  DO you know...have any other people that saw the same thing? idf you could shed a little light on what I may have seen, please let me know. Thanks;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
Blue fireball travelling east-west at around 7p.m Pacific time  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably meteor.  PD));2005-03-12 19:45:00;8-10 seconds;Blue fireball travelling east-west at around 7p.m Pacific time Possibly a meteor. One blue fireball crossed above my backyard, observed through a large window. My granddaughter yelled out A shooting star!, and I turned to the window, saying No, that's just an ...oh my!. I had time to stand up,take a few steps,then it was gone. It was travelling east-west in the southern sky. Since I was looking downhill in the dark, it was hard to tell how far away, or how big, it was.

I notice a light directly in front of my vehicle and my first thought was that it was a plane or some kind of air craft.  I decided to continue to drive unil I reached an area where there was parking along Dallas road.   Here there was a much better view of this object that was continuing to fall from the sky.  I did notice 5 other men watching the same object I was.   The light seemed to be on fire and falling through the sky very quickly.   Soon it was all over and the light vanished into the horizon, sinking into the ocean.  That was it.  Was it a meteor?
