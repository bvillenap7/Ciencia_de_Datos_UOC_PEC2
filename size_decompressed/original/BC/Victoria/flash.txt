I believe the date was Jan 10, 2003 - might have been the week before.  4 of us were sitting in a house over looking the Gorge waterway in Victoria.  2 of us were facing the window.  Out of nowehere came a VERY bright illuminescent comet-like object moving fairly slowly downward toward the treeline.  What I saw was a blueish colour and what the other person saw was more red.  It came down, paused at the treeline, then disappeared.  It was NOT a firework or space junk.  The way it moved was too irrational.  We have never seen nor experienced anything like this previously so we prompty called the Marine-Air-Rescue department.  The person answering the phone had numerous other calls and had never heard of this kind of thing either.  He had worked there for 30 years and couldn't explain it.  He said there was no passing satellites or aircraft at the time.  He also said there were reports from Esquimalt, Oak Bay, and even over in Delta of the same thing.  Some reported the object(s) ascending as well.  I still have no idea or explanation.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
