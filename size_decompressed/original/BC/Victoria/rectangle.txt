slow moving rectangle lifts away from hover position and vanishes in a flash;2004-08-22 22:00:00;1 minute;slow moving rectangle lifts away from hover position and vanishes in a flash A low flying dark rectangle with one white light at each end traveled horizontally across our field of view over Juan De Fuca straight. Then slowly lifted in to the upper atmosphere where the lights became faint and then a flash and a streak of light it was gone. It was much to bright and white light to be a meteortie and too consistant in movement and path as well. I live near a busy road and could not discern any sound.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
huge rectangular solar panel over victoria;2007-04-15 18:00:00;3min;huge rectangular solar panel over victoria As i was driving down the road to can west mall, I saw a huge rectangular solar panel very high in the northeasterly sky. I tried to keep my eyes on it and figure out what it could be, it was definetly not moving. It must have been massive to appear that size at an alltitude higher than any jet i've ever seen. As I watched, it began to tip horizontaly  and then it was gone. as if it had closed. what could it have been? are there solar panels in space? ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event may be approximate.
