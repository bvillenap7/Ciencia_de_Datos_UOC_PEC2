long  cigar shaped bright green object flying from east to west;2004-03-19 22:30:00;3 seconds;long  cigar shaped bright green object flying from east to west Came overhead in a east west direction. It was long and green moving super fast and dissapeared over the horizon. It looked like it was either in a low orbit and small in size of was large in a high orbit. Sky was clear except for a few low clouds, and the temperture was a few degrees above freezing. We were looking out a west facing window when it came into view. Only saw it for three seconds. Long like a cigar. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
cigar shaped ,white silver object  with dark ports on side hovered  breifly then dissappeared;2004-10-03 09:15:00;9-10 seconds;cigar shaped ,white silver object  with dark ports on side hovered  breifly then dissappeared I was jogging along  the Galloping Goose trail when I stopped to let some cyclist pass,while they were passing I looked up in the sky-the moon was still showing  with many of its feature in evidence. Something sligtly below the moon in my vision caught my eye,it was the color of white Silver with the shape of a cigar. At what i assumed to be the front end of the object there were some marking that appeared to be dark ridges or grooves and from where I stood the grooves appeared to  incircle that portion of the object. Midway from both ends there was a collar-like portion that extended around the object. Between the twocollars there appeared to be  dark port holes it just hung there in the brilliance of the day. The cyclysts approached so I took my eyes off of the object,their passing took maybe a second,when I look back the object was nowhere to be seen-skies were clear I should have been able to see any conventional aircraft.
