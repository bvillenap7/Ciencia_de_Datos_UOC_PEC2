Silent Red Ball of light.;1998-06-01 17:00:00;1 minute;Silent Red Ball of light. Watched a ball of red light move slowly towards me. It was about 25' diameter. At first i thought it was a helicopter, but realised as it moved closer that it wasn't making any sound whatsoever, and it was just a sphere of red light about 50 feet away from me. I ran outside to get a better look (which took about 3 seconds) but it was no longer there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

two lights, moving SW performing manuevers, then instantly vanishing.;2003-02-11 19:58:00;10 minutes;two lights, moving SW performing manuevers, then instantly vanishing. I was taking the dog out for an evening walk...I looked up in the clear night sky to see two very bright yellow lights( approx 3 to 4 times brighter than an airplane light) about .5 to 3/4 of a Km away. Both lights were travelling side by side moving SW from my position at a slow rate of speed (Much slower than a airplane). At approx 19:59 both lights moved in opposite directions (on a parallel plane), one to the South the other to the North, at a high rate of speed. The items moved approx .5 Km appart, stopped for about 15-20 seconds, then returned to thier side by side position, slower than the seperation, about 1/4 the speed. I then ran inside to get my wife. Upon returning 15-20 seconds later we observed them continue moving slowly in a SW direction for 2 min when they vanished, almost like some one turn off a switch.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  3  bright round objects.;2004-05-18 22:35:00;30 to 40 seconds;3  bright round objects. Full Description of event/sighting: The witness to this sighting sent an email to me informing me of what he saw and asked if I would be able to call him as it was a little hard to explain what was observed. I did call him the next evening and took the report which is below.  The man told me that he is the type of fellow who watches the night sky as he has a really interest in astronomy and mentioned that he also had found me through the Jeff Rense website.  The fellow went outside to have a cigarette when he first saw the light/object. At first the man thought it was a satellite. The object was as bright as the planet Venus and heading in a northerly direction traveling from the south on a straight line. As the object moved across the sky another two lights/objects shot out of it, one light heading to the east and the other towards the west. Both of the lights that shot off together went at the exact same time. Also they were not as bright and allot smaller than the main light. The main light never lost it's brightness as it moved across the sky. The witness believes the object he was observing was at a very high altitude. The object was visible to the fellow for approx: 30 to 40 seconds before it finally disappeared. All of the object were white in color and no tail or trail was seen following behind each of them.  Thank you to the person for the report.

bright light disappears with no trace;2005-01-28 07:45:00;1 minute;bright light disappears with no trace Driving into work I noticed a bright almost flaming light - thought it was a plane coming headlong.  Not really big, but bright.  Then I thought it wasn't actually moving and may be a star.  I pointed it out to my husband in the passenger seat and my teenage son in the back.  Then all of a sudden it disappeared.  My husband said it was a plane that turned off its landing light, but I couldn't see anything at all in the sky although the sky wasn't bright, it didn't appear to be overcast.  OK - but closer into town and now in morning rush hour traffic, directly ahead of me I noticed the same light appear into view, and I thought a plane was banking and caught sunlight, but again the light disappeared, it was there one second, then gone.  Bright blue sky with no trace of any object to be seen - same as before.  Further, a couple of months ago, early one morning, we noticed a bright light travelling along.  And while, it may have been an airplane reflecting light, it was quite bright and looked more like a meteor, except that it was definitely in the atmosphere.  Strangest airplane sightings in all my years of noticing airplanes!  No one will believe this stuff until they land and are on network tv, I guess.

Two seperate sightings, from living room window, west coast of Canada;2007-10-25 21:00:00;60 SECONDS;Two seperate sightings, from living room window, west coast of Canada I was looking at the nights sky, it was overcast, and only a few stars were visible, I looked up and saw what my brain thought to be a satellite, moving west to south.  It was small, and bright, like a star, or sattelite, but its movements became irregular.   It was roving quite simply at first, but then it moved down, then back in the direction that it had been moving in, then it zipped over to the right again, then it did something wierd...it zoomed away from the planet, well it went left, really really fast, turbo speed...then it stopped.  Didn't move for a second or two, then continued to move in a strange pattern, eventually moving out of sight.   Living in an apartment building, I only have a sight view of the sky.  I am not the type to see a ufo.. I am 23, a female and not into this stuff too much, although the FACE ON MARS is nuts...anyway, I read alot about the brain, and once I saw this strange light I read up about what it could be, and decided that I did in fact believe that intellegent life was observing our planet, for whatever reason.  After that, I saw another UFO, or whatever it was, that was about a week ago from now, NOV.8 2007, I was looking out the window again, and I thought I saw a grey seagull, riding the wind.  As I watched the gull I noticed that it didn't ride the wind as an amimal should, rather it just moved wiht the same altutde in one direction.   As I looked closley, realizing that I was looking at a dark disk, not very high up, no lights.  It looked very stealth, yet very clear.  I have 20/20 vision, so I know what I saw, and I looked like a dark disk, flying overhead.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524

Bright orange orb, flying very fast but changing speed and direction, seen flying SSE to NNW over downtown Victoria, BC;2010-12-20 23:50:00;1 minute;Bright orange orb, flying very fast but changing speed and direction, seen flying SSE to NNW over downtown Victoria, BC The object was a bright orange light. It was first seen coming from the SSE direction. It was travelling about the speed of a fighter jet, but made no sound.  The object had no blinking lights, therefore omitting the possibility of it being a plane or helicopter.  It moved very fast, but slowed down and sped up again...twice. Also, when it changed speeds, it changed it's direction.  While still travelling forwards, it banked down and then back up many times.  The object seemed to go dim and bright again many times. The light seemed brighter as it came towards us, but was dim as it left in the NNW direction. Me and four of my friends were watching the lunar eclipse that night, and when the clouds blocked the moon, we began walking back to the house.  This object was below the clouds, maybe 1000ft above the ground.  We were only able to observe it for roughly 30 - 40 seconds.  It disappeared out of our view beyond some trees in the NNW direction.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
Two blue lights travel over ocean from Esquimalt Lagoon Colwood making no noise or water disturbance at high speed to the USA.;2012-05-12 23:00:00;35 to 45 seconds;Two blue lights travel over ocean from Esquimalt Lagoon Colwood making no noise or water disturbance at high speed to the USA. I work in the Health Care Field and my friend is retired and worked as a English Second Language Teacher and with Canada Rail. Esquimalt Lagoon, (Colwood),Victoria, B.C. At approximately 11:00 pm  PST I drove to the Lagoon in Colwood with a friend along Ocean Boulevard from Island Hwy.  I kept seeing a very bright light on my  left,drivers mirror but no actual light in the mirror itself.  In the rear view mirror there was no vehicle nor light of any kind.  On the right mirror side I saw the shine of light around my mirror as well periodically.  I felt like a vehicle was following my SUV.  Only when I asked the friend if he could see this vehicle did we see for a short while one bright light and one small yellow light in the right mirror.  My friend said looks like it could be a car with only one light then it did not show up in the mirror. When we arrived at the Lagoon a minute later and pulled in I did not notice the vehicle go by but assumed I had missed it or it had stopped on the road. We sat and talked awhile and all of a sudden two blue lights (very blue) were gliding smoothly over the ocean towards the USA. I could not see if the lights were attached and if so the craft would have had to be very big or if they were individual crafts.  It was very dark out.  These lights were very low to the water, travelled without noise, were not at all erratic in movement and did not move the water surface.  The water surface was lit in large spots by lights from the Shipyard/Dockyard which was quite a ways away but are so high they light up the water at a distance and no disturbance showed on the water by the blue lights. These lights were a fair distance apart did not blink at all and seemed to travel one behind the other simultaneously.  All known craft do not seem to fit into what we saw.  Helicopter or hovercraft should have exhibited noise, or water movement or both.  Planes do not travel that smooth nor do helicopters.  Too smooth also for speedboats.  The speed also does not fit any other craft. These lights disappeared as they got close to the USA. I have mentioned the lights on my car as they may have been some anomaly as well as I can not figure why on such a curvy road I was unable to catch glimpses of a vehicle or at least some light in the rear view mirror or a beam in the side mirror not just around it.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524

3 orange lights seen moving in the sky;2013-10-18 19:30:00;10 minutes;3 orange lights seen moving in the sky On my way home from university at approximately 7:30 pm I was almost at my doorstep when I noticed two orange lights near the northwest horizon at about 10-11 o'clock, near the big dipper constellation.  The weather at the time was low fog but not very thick at all as the stars were still clearly visible, just enough so that you could see it in the headlights of cars.  There was no wind that I noticed. It was still dusk, and most stars and planets were not very bright yet.  Immediately I thought they were aircraft, as float planes and helicopters frequently fly low over the area, only the latter at night. There is also a naval base in the area and sea kings and search and rescue helicopters sometimes fly relatively low over my house. I then noticed however that there were no running or strobe lights of any kind and the lights were too orange to be landing lights.  They were too bright for stars or planets at that time of night, but not overly bright, like Venus or Jupiter in the middle of the night.  The lights moved at a moderate pace, certainly something that would be typical for an aircraft.  The two were fairly close together at the start, sort of in a diagonal top to bottom orientation. but then they proceeded to turn around each other so that they switched positions, and were then much closer together at the end of the process.  The bottom one then faded out and disappeared from view, followed by the top one 10 or so seconds later, as it desc! ended.  This whole sighting lasted approximately 40 seconds to just over a minute at most although its hard to say exactly.  During the time i tried to film with my phone camera but nothing would show up on my screen.  (My phone camera does not work well in low light and the lights were relatively faint compared to the streetlights on my street). I then ran inside to tell a family member what I saw.  They came outside with my and I pointed to the area where they appeared.  A short time later, another light, that looked exactly the same rose from the horizon over my house.  It was more shimmering than the first two, and was lower in the sky and slower.  It quickly flickered and went out, my relative commenting that it looked like a Chinese lantern.  I feel as though the third one could easily be that, but the first two were much stranger looking.  It may be worth mentioning that between the two sightings there were some flashes in the sky much higher up it seemed, like the strobe light of a high flying jet, but only 2 or 3 flashes and not at regular intervals like would be expected, they were much further apart. I waited outside for another 5 min but saw nothing further. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
Large, bright, orange orb like lights seen low on horizon.;2015-12-04 18:30:00;30 seconds;Large, bright, orange orb like lights seen low on horizon. At approximately 6:30 pm PST, with clear visibility to the east, a couple and their daughter from Victoria, BC, were gazing out at the eastern evening sky from inside their house, when they observed a bright orange circular light, orb like in appearance traveling across the sky directly overhead towards them from east to north west.  This was observed for about 20 seconds.  It was an extremely bright light, unlike anything else they had ever observed in the night sky before. There were other aircraft visible in the night sky and they were more distant, so the orange light appeared to be much lower down.  As the light passed overhead, it changed to a more northerly direction and seemed to climb to a higher altitude.  At one point, the light seemed to become stationary, gained altitude, then grew dimmer and eventually vanished. Approximately ten minutes later, while the family was still gazing out, a second slightly more intense light appeared. It seemed to be lower on the horizon, and traveled overhead in a more direct east to west trajectory.  The couple opened their window to see if they could detect any sound, but it was silent.  The second sighting seemed to last about 20 seconds before the light vanished into a cloud bank. The intensity of both lights was much brighter than the brightest star in the night sky.  The size of the objects appeared to be about 10 times the diameter of the brightest star.

String of white lights travelling single file uniformly spaced.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-02-20 06:05:00;11 minutes;String of white lights travelling single file uniformly spaced 02-20-2020 I live in Victoria British Columbia on Vancouver Island and was up at 6:00 am. to let my dog out to do her morning business and I follow her out and stand on guard to watch for deer sleeping in our back yard. It was still dark out so I looked up to view the stars when I immediately noticed two white lights extremely high up overhead travelling side by side moving in a North-Easterly direction. I thought that was unusual except immediately following the same path, elevation and speed was literally a convoy of white lights in single file following the two side by side lights. I started counting them but stopped at ten and looked in the direction from which they were coming from which was the South-West. I saw a long continuous line coming one after the other and at that point I ran into my bedroom and excitedly called for my wife to come see this string of lights. I ran back outside and was quickly joined by my wife and we both watched this, what seemed like an almost endless ! string of lights travelling what I can only assume is in space. The time I began watching the first time was 6:05 am. and the parade of lights lasted until the very last one in the column was at 6:16 am. I have no idea how many of these lights the were but I would estimate well over one hundred. I don’t know if there were more lights pre-ceding the column when I observed the first two but truly an amazing site to behold, plus I finally have a witness this time. My dog at one point was growling and looking up at me and seconds later I pointed out to my wife a jet airliner travelling towards us and the column but at a bisecting North-West direction heading South-East and far below the column of lights.
