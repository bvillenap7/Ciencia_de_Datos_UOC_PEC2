4 lights turned into 6, then turned into V-shape and took off.;1995-08-15 20:00:00;10-15 seconds;4 lights turned into 6, then turned into V-shape and took off. I had come home with my family from my grandmothers house and was holding the door open while the rest of my family went into the house.  I suddenly had the urge to look up into the sky, it was a cloudless, starry night, with no breeze and saw an object, 4 lights in a row, this all happened very quickly, about 10-15 seconds or so, I don't know the length of time at all.  But then two more lights came on at either end of the row and then the object turned into a V-shape and sped off at a high rate of speed in an eastern direction.  I had no witnesses though for by the time I said, Hey look at that!  The object had already disappeared from sight.  A couple years later I mentioned this to my grandma and she told me that my great-aunt had seen the same sort of object.  I have also seen a report on this object on the show Unsolved Mysteries when it was on the air. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain anonymous.  Date is approximate.

Orange lights in Victoria, BC, Canada.;2010-07-18 01:00:00;15 mins;Orange lights, Victoria, BC, Canada At approximately 12.45 am on Sunday, July 18, 2010, I was on my sun-deck just before retiring.  I noticed two large brightly lit orange balls in the eastern sky, one above the other, above my neighbor’s roof.   I watched them for about 15 minutes.  During this time, they seemed to move closer to one another and then seemed to merge.  They did not diverge.  Other than that they didn’t move.   I watched them through binoculars but they didn’t look like anything I had ever seen before.  They were much smaller than the moon would be in the same place but much larger than a star or planet might be, and a very different color.  I had no way to determine how far away they might be. The night seemed to be clear.  There had been some sea-mist earlier in the day and before dark but that was only seen to the south.  However, perhaps it is possible that the sea-mist had come up again after dark and caused some kind of unusual reflection.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
