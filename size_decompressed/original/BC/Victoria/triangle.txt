massive black triagle flew  200' over my house!;2007-05-29 10:00:00;3minutes;massive black triagle flew  200' over my house! An extemely large triangular shaped craft flew over my house at approximately 200'. this craft was moving at a speed of no more than 5mph. It was massive, at least 150' wide. As it flew right over my head i was unable to define it, as if it were 'cloaked' in some way, and was a moving mass of 'darkness' against the clear night sky. It was definitley a triangular shape. The engine was like nothing i have ever heard before, like the sound of giant blowers or fans. It had a flashing red beacon in the front and two very bright clear lights, one on each side., however they did not illuminate the ground at all. It flew right over my roof and then began to gain alltitude,  As i watched it fly away from me it's two bright clear lights were dog tracking back and forth across the sky.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
Triangular shaped, three lights very large. no sound, seen by 2;2013-02-07 21:30:00;1 minute;Triangular shaped, three lights very large. no sound, seen by 2 We were walking the trails in Kilarney Lake when we notices a light very bright but it didt light up the woods, it floated over the trees flying very low.  No sound came from it. it then turned sideways and was very large it seemed to form a triangle shape.   We were freaking out trying to determine what it was and instantly it just dissapeared. It was very scary.   No sounds no wind from it.   It was very big and very close to were we were maybe 800 meters in the tree line.  It dissapeared so fast.  We were scared so we left the area.  It seemed to be triangular in shape with three lights.  The triangle was not pointy but more rounded. it moved very slow and tilted into the trees.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
3 bright lights sighted rising in the sky then disappearing.;2013-06-30 23:00:00;1 minute;3 bright lights sighted rising in the sky then disappearing. This is to submit an incident report by myself and my wife last night (approximately 11:00 PM, June 30th, 2013) in Victoria BC , Canada. My family and myself were having a BBQ , then later an open fire pit in our backyard when this incident happened. My wife and myself were siting facing south when we spotted 3 bright stars (lights possibly, we compared the stars/lights to the brightest planet we saw that night and they were a little bit brighter but not twinkling).  The 3 lights were in a triangle with one of the pointed ends facing down towards the earth.  Then all 3 lights (in complete unison) started moving slowly towards the sky, they then slowly faded out and disappeared.   From where we were siting, the triangle of lights were in the sky starting at about 25 degrees , then rose to about just under 40 degrees before disappearing.  The size of the triangle was approximately the equivalent of at least 5-6 full moons in the night sky (it was fairly large). This happened at about 11:00PM on June 30th, 2013 and lasted for just under 1 minute. I have a wife and 2 children and run and Information Technology company here in Victoria.   This is the first time in my life that I have seen something that, up to this point, my wife or myself cannot explain.  We are very curious to know what exactly we were looking at last night.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
Triangle shape, twinkling lights, floating, no sound.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a sighting of planets in the E sky.  PD));2015-11-29 00:00:00;2 hours;Triangle shape, twinkling lights, floating, no sound A Light twinkling in the sky floated and changed position every few minutes.  It was the shape of a triangle/tree like, with orange, white and green lights.  It floated over the city and moved forward and backwards and over the course of an hour it had moved across the sky from south to north.  I Tried to use binoculars but they were outdated, fuzzy and I could not see the actual form, just the lights.  There was no sound.  Our city noted the police department could be testing drones however I don't think they can go that high or have a battery life of that long.  After 2 hours I had to go to sleep however the object was still in the sky, but I don't know for how long.  Usually there are aircraft in the area no matter what day of the week, but there was none this night which is very unusual.
