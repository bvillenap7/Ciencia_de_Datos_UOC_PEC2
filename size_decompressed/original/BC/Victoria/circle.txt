Saw a single white light that looked like a star, not moving in the North sky. As it was a clear night I didn't think anything of it, looked away for less then a min looked back and object was gone. None planes or other aircraft were heard around the area. Total time I saw it less then one min. There was some interferance while using a cell phone around that same time;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
a round ,glowing green object  apeared in the northern sky, remained stationary for  seconds and then went out, definitely not the moon;2003-04-20 21:30:00;10-15 seconds;a round ,glowing green object  apeared in the northern sky, remained stationary for  seconds and then went out, definitely not the moon object appeared due north approx. 45 degrees up from horizon - medium to light green and mottled (somewhat like the moon) possibly glowing or reflective - about two to three lunar diameters at this location - perceived as distant and  round (flat or spherical) - I viewed this only for a few seconds then the light went out, leaving me with the distinct impression of someone or something realizing a switch had been left on, turned it off - not beyond the realm of being man made but ......... - my background does not include credentials that would make my opinion worthy but a certain amount of pragmatism and attentiveness will suffice in some areas ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

The object dropped flaming debris then vanished having changed colour.;2003-09-12 21:00:00;5 minutes;The object dropped flaming debris then vanished having changed colour. A dull orange round object entered the sky above Victoria from the west. The sky was clear and lots of stars could be seen. The object very slowly came to a stop and it appeared to be about 2000-3000 feet above the city. It remained suspended for about two minutes during which time I checked my watch at 9.00pm. I was with a fellow worker and we stood on a sidewalk watching this object, and soon another ten people or so joined us and watched it. The object seemed to have a large gantry object sticking out in an inverted V shape but strangely the 'gantry' would appear to show up on different sides of the object.  After hovering in a fixed position, the object slowly moved nothward but then a most astonishing thing happened. Long streamers, about a dozen in number streamed down, each streamer was on fire and falling in wavy fashion but the flaming debris went out long before they reached ground. The object then started to dull itself to complete black and disappeared from sight within two seconds.  No noise or flashing lights were seen.  I reported the matter to police and air traffic control at Victoria (left a voice message) but police not interested and air traffic control did not return my call. I am surprised this sighting has not been covered by local media. This is my first UFO sighting ever. I am 62 years old.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
Six white lights encircling greenish dot, seen over Washington state,10000 feet, high moves  slowly southward;2004-12-15 08:10:00;~40 minutes;Six white lights encircling greenish dot, seen over Washington state,10000 feet, high moves  slowly southward dec.15 2004..Victoria BC Canada...looking southeast toward Port townsend.I thought i saw what i thought was the last star of the night.The sun was upabout 5 degrees,toward the east.I trained my 10x50 binoculars on this 'star',as i focused it looked strange....it was a cluster of six white lights encircling a green dot.The white lights were equidistance around circle of green.The six lights around the perifery were joined with a fine reddish coloured string.The whole thing pulsed.it seemed to be breathing.Imagine a coarse fish net thrown over a  green jello blob...the words  jelly fish ,amoeba,plasma best describe  this strange sight....as soon as i saw this weirdness i ran inside and grabbed my spotting scope,it is a 40x60 monocular scope...this thing looked like a single point of white light ,but when i zoomed in i see this greenish dot surrounded by dancing white lights.Even though this green dot is panting in and out,it seams to be held to a  fairly circlular shape,by the  reddish netting .The object progressed  slowly, arcing higher and more to the south.It started out at about 20 degrees above horizontal  and the object kept moving toward the two oclock position in my eye piece.I was so shocked to see this thing i  knocked on four apartment doors to grab a witness.Fortunately,my neighbour came right over...he also saw six white lights encircling a greenish dot.We watched this for over 30 minutes.I phoned a local TV station to see if they could see it.I want to believe that this was the newly rising sun reflecting off a sattelite,but i cannot.These six white lights were so distictive,the way they held the greenish center as it undulated and pulsed in and out.I dont care what any one says about me  , what i saw was NOT manmade! In my humble opinion ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness via telephone, and he sounded quite serious-minded to us.  PD));48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
Small bright light observed flying in close proximity to what looked like a plane.;2005-02-16 16:45:00;5 minutes;Small bright light observed flying in close proximity to what looked like a plane. After concluding a game of golf (Mt. Douglas Golf Course), my brother and I were returning to our car when to the east approximately 30 degrees above the horizon and 10 - 15 km away we witnessed what looked like a plane (typical cylindrical shape) flying in a southerly direction towards the Olympic Mountains. Obviously a plane flying along the Straight of Georgia in a path towards Seattle is normal, however the 'plane' was quite low in the sky (approximately 2000m) AND HAD ANOTHER CRAFT VERY CLOSE IN FRONT AND ABOVE THE NOSE OF THE PLANE SEEMINGLY GUIDING IT. The secondary craft was small...circular and white and it was approximately 50-100 metres in front and above the nose of what I believed to be a plane. For the duration of the event, the secondary craft remained at the same distance from the 'plane' except for a brief moment when the gap seemed to close...this may be due to a quick manouvre to the southeast however the original distance between the two craft was soon recovered. After observing the craft for a few minutes, the craft were soon too far away to be seen in great detail, so my brother and I drove away.  I am a 23 year old, home on vacation from working for a cruiseline in the Caribbean. I have a criminology degree and policing aspirations. My brother is 25 years old and a banker with a local credit union.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
Bright saucer spinning & zig zagging in the night sky.;2006-12-27 02:30:00;1 hour;Bright saucer spinning & zig zagging in the night sky. I had just finished watching television and I look out my window.  I saw a light in the sky I didn't think much of it at first until I saw the light was throbbing kind of fading in and out but still maintaining a high light level.  I saw the objective and when I closed one eye I could see the object zig zagging from side to side.  I went into the living room to awake my roomate but he refused to get up and look.  From my living room I saw the ufo on more of a side-rear view and saw the craft moving up, down, and side to side.  The object was white and when concentrated hard on the light u could see multiple colours.  At first it seemed to have been red and blue but over time it went to  other colours as well.  I returned to my room and it was still there i lied in bed and watched it zig zag out of curosity. My lazy eye kicked in and my sight went out of focus.  During this I saw the ufo itself.  It was a disc shape object, I could only see its shape when i wasnt focused on the lights of the craft.  I saw it spinning clockwise with a light shining down on the sky below.  It was I am predicting a few hundred to thousand feet away.  The object was fairly small but still rather large.  I live in the downtown area of Victoria, bc and I believe it was above the Inner Harbor/James Bay area.  (This was the second ufo i've seen in the general area within the last 3 weeks.  I saw a craft very simular and a lot closer approxmity 3 weeks prior.  The ufo was hovering about 400-800 feet away with the same bright lights.  It zig zagged back and forth.  Within 12 seconds of me seeing the craft it traveled to 1/3 of the size it was.  Roughly a grape fruit size.  It zig zagged abit then took off from a grape fruit to nothing and I saw it to the last second.  It took roughly 6 seconds to get totally out of sight from a grape fruit to spec.);48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524

Then all of a sudden to my amazement I noticed three more of the same balls in a line from one edge of the sky to the other the first two balls joined with the three other ones and they all formed a line across the sky,  Then they all began to move together up and away towards the west four of the balls slowly disappeared after five minutes then one ball stayed behind and floated and stayed for another five minutes then moved slowly up and away into the blue sky and disappeared.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524

I went outside with my dog and looked up and saw a huge glowing orange circle in the backyard of my condominium complex.  I saw it briefly, then it disappeared.   I have never seen anything quite like it.   I emailed my friend and described what I had just seen.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524

I guess you can say it was floating across the sky going through the clouds heading towards Seattle.  It was linear and no sound.   One more thing there was no reflection of light off of it.  Float planes as there coming in reflect sun light off the windows and wing tips as there coming in for a landing.  It also cross right in the front of there flight path. Have a nice day.
