Formation of lights in shape of Great Bear Star System moving west above Port Angelos.;2001-01-10 20:00:00;5 minutes;Formation of lights in shape of Great Bear Star System moving west above Port Angelos. Was sitting on a seat overlooking Juan De Fuca Strait from Victoria.  Was looking towards Port Angelos and saw a configuration of lights moving west that was approximately in the shape of the Great Bear Star System.  This configuration of lights was moving towards the west at about 1 degree of angle per second and because it was directly over Port Angelos about 1 degree above the city center.   Because the whole configuration was moving in a united fashion with the shape of the configuration not changing I don't think I was confusing the lights with those of moving vehicles.  This lasted about 5 minutes and fortunately I had 8 power magnification binoculars with me so I checked by examining the configuration through my binoculars. Being very jubilant I proceeded back to my condo on the 23rd floor of Orchard House, Victoria, and went out on the balcony.  This was about 25 minutes later than the first sightings.  I sensed three consective flashes of light originating from the sky S.S.W. and about 30 degrees above the horizon.  I sensed at the same time as these flashes a subtle current going through my body.  Was expecting a ship to appear but was disappointed that one didn't. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
Group of  Many Ufos  taking formations over nighttime sky.;2001-08-12 00:00:00;10 MINUTES;Group of  Many Ufos  taking formations over nighttime sky. While going outside for a smoke at a wedding reception, I noticed a bunch of people pointing at the sky. We were having a meteor shower so I thought thats what they were looking at. They told me to look at the formation So I did. To my shock there was about 6 or so stars in a hexigonal patern but the stars were  moving like they were doing a show.They were in a semi circle and the circle sort of broke a bit and they one by one started   to move farther away and sped off at a high rate of speed. This was in front of at least 5 others with me. Wow. It was wild. ((NUFORC Note:  Please see other reports from witnesses to same event.  PD));48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524

Group of illuminated lights over Victoria, BC;2008-05-24 23:22:00;15 seconds;Group of illuminated lights over Victoria, BC While sitting in our hot tub, my wife and I noticed a bright large formation of small illuminated lights approaching from the west they formed the shape of a large winged plane with no tail, but far too large to be a plane. There was no sound and the object was traveling at a very high speed. It appeared to be only a couple of thousand feet above us. It quickly flew east towards the city of Victoria BC and then we lost sight.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
8 satellite like objects in formation of 4 sets of 2s spaced equally like Christmas lights on a roof.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-08-13 03:56:00;4 seconds;8 satellite like objects in formation of 4 sets of 2s spaced equally like Christmas lights on a roof. I viewed two rows of bright objects in the sky (not quite as bright as the ISS (-2.5) but about that size).  There was eight objects in total (4 sets of 2). ________________________________________ O O   O O   O O   O O _________________________________________  These objects were moving uniformly (as one unit) ENE.  The objects were not like shiny stars but rather looked like what a satelite looks like in the sky.  They were moving quite fast as they appeared about 80 degrees and faded from sight around 25 degrees, all in under 5 seconds.  My wife and I were viewing the meteor shower and were shocked to see such a magnificently perfect sight.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
