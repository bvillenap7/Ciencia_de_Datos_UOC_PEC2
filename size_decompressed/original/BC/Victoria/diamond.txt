Diamond shaped object in night sky S-S of Victoria BC at around 11 o'clock position;2003-08-24 01:52:00;Ongoing;Diamond shaped object in night sky S-S of Victoria BC at around 11 o'clock position Light that is visible in a fixed location in the night sky S-SW of Victoria BC approximately in the 11 o'clock position in the sky. Light is much brighter than any other object in the sky and seems to be diamond shaped that is off-yellow in colour. I noticed it from my backyard and was visible through the trees, this is why it caught my eye. I'm no astronomer so it could be venus or another celestial body, even a satellite but I have never noticed it before and it appears synthetic to my untrained eye. As of 1:57am it is still visible and appears to have moved somewhat. Not moving very much though. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witness might have witnessed the planet, Mars, which is quite prominent, currently.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous, and provides no contact information.  PD));48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
Big diamond shaped object outlined by white lights gliding through the night sky.;2006-06-23 22:40:00;2 minutes;Big diamond shaped object outlined by white lights gliding through the night sky. I was cycling through downtown (View St.) late in the evening when I saw a huge horizontally orientated diamond shaped object (closer to a rhombus shape) to the South.  It was outlined by 8 white lights, one at each corner and one in between.  Within were another four white lights, also a diamond formation, and 4 or 5 red ones.  The lights were spaced out evenly and symmetrically suggestion a solid shape. Looking around I saw that there was no-one else on the street.  It moved slowly from East to West, making no sound whatsoever, gliding through the night sky. It disappeared from view behind an apartment building.  I followed it waiting for it to reappear on the other side when I realized it had moved far off in the distance.  Itâ€™s hard to say how big it was, but my guess is up to a mile wide.;48.4522881040891;-123.394880111524
