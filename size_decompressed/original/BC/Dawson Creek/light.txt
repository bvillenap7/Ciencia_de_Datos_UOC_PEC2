HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Large bight white light travel across the night sky and when it was low in the horizon it stopped.;2003-06-25 23:30:00;8 or 9 seconds;A man called and reported seeing a very large bight white light travel across the night sky and when it was low in the horizon it stopped. It sat there for a few seconds and then disappeared. The sighting lasted approx: for 8 or 9 seconds. No sound was heard and no unusual maneuvers were noted. The witness said, I thought not much of it until it came to a complete stop before disappearing. He then told me that was pretty weird.  Thank you to the witness for the report.
