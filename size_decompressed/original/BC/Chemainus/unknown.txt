Small red light searching threw the clouds;2020-03-30 23:00:00;2 minutes;Small red light searching threw the clouds staying at my parents house helping them get it ready to sell there house. They live at the bottom of Mt. Sicker and Copper canyon. The Chemainus River is the only thing separating them from the outback. I went outside at around 23:00 to let the dogs out. It had been raining on and off all day so it was mostly cloudy. I could see a small patch of stars. I was hearing a low pulsing type tone. Then I noticed in the clouds lights they were flashing redish white colours. So I stared in a kind of disbelief because I knew in the background we’re the clouds so that gave me reference it was  low enough for me to see but To high for me to make out what it was and it it couldn’t be a star. It wasn’t really moving either it just kind of stayed there. It gave me enough time to get a my phone out for a 1.45m video but it doesn’t do justice. So ran inside and grabbed my high power rifle but couldn’t focus it my adrenaline was pumping. So then I ran upstairs and grabbed my! moms spotting scope as it is on a stand which made it very easy to focus once i focused in that’s when I realized I was seeing something I had never seen before it I could make out a red shape and it was like it was searching threw the clouds with a real Powerful white radiant wavy type light the light was moving at random not really looking in one spot long enough. first I thought maybe police on the mountain but then i realized it’s to far up and the clouds are to low for that to be in the mountain. I then ran inside woke up my dad he came out but it had disappeared I thought classic! I showed him the video and tried to explain it to him as we have seen weird stuff in the sky’s before always being out near the bush. I don’t know what it was but it sure got my blood pumping;48.9236;-123.7179
