A bright orange light over the Chemainus River, Vancouver Island lasting 15 minutes.;2011-01-22 19:25:00;15 minutes;A bright orange light over the Chemainus River, Vancouver Island lasting 15 minutes. We were driving down Crofton Road in a N W direction towards the junction of  Chemainus Road when we saw a bright large orange light in the sky  above the Chemainus River on our left side.  The light appeared to be burning slowly  in a downward tail of smoke. We then saw two small red flashing lights and we heard what seemed to be an engine flying above us in the direction of Crofton.  Then the light  reappeared in the same position just as bright.  All this happened over a period of ten minutes.  We took two photos with our cell phone, one at 7:31pm after watching for approximately five minutes then the second one was at 7:32pm.;48.9236;-123.7179
