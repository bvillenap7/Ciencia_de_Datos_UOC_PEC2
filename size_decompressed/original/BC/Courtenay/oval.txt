((HOAX??))  my friend and I were outside I said to him that is a funny star I never seen it there before.;2011-05-12 22:00:00;hours;my friend and I were outside I said to him that is a funny star I never seen it there before.  I said to him do you see a haze of light around it he said yes.  I went for my binoculers and had a look.  It was not a star ,yet it looked like it was that far away.   As he looked at it I called a freind with a teleascope to look at it and call me back.  He called back and informed me that he was not sure what he was looking at and in turned call a friend that had a bigger telescope.  He said that it was no star, no air planes, satelight, weather baloon. his discription was  It was a large silver object surounded by a super bright haze of bright white light.I was up untill 3 am and it did not move at all.  It was gone the next night ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));49.6620513513514;-124.998467567568
Greenish white light full size of moon shape. Speeds off shooting off like a Rocket, and disappeared...;2014-09-13 21:30:00;1+ minute;Greenish white light full size of moon shape. Speeds off shooting off like a Rocket, and disappeared... Heading home, we where in our car, we saw a moon shaped greenish white light, full-size of a moon close up.  Facing us while driving seeing its full circle shape.  And glowing light. Following us actually it was moving faster then our car.   Then after a few seconds, it speeded up and shot off like a rocket.  Almost like a rocket would do when you shoot it from the ground but this was in mid air, going straight not shooting up like a rocket would do.  When It shot off, there was a trail of light it was no longer as big as a moon.   And we saw something smaller but black shoot faster out of the light and then it disappeared.   Not sure what that was but we can not think of anything else beside a possible ufo explanation.;49.6620513513514;-124.998467567568
