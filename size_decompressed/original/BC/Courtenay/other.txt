It wasen't shaped like a star and it was a lot brighter then any of the other star, also it was moving.  It didn't have an orbit, it would move really fast, then stop moving, it would move in the shape of a horse-shoe, and spiral around, it couldn't have been a plane because it was going to fast and was too high, planes also do not manouver in the way we saw it.  All four of us saw it, we watched it for about 30 min, and it moved like nothing we had ever seen, in the sky, then it started going straight moving very fast, and gradually became dimmer. It flashed every so often either brighter or different colors such as green, red, blue.  It eventually faded away and we couldn't see it anymore, after about 45 min.;49.6620513513514;-124.998467567568
