The gree;1998-09-22 23:30:00;3-4 sec;Viewed from beach facing East on Vancouver Island.  Saw what I assumed to be a meteor until listening to Art Bell on 09/23/98. The greenish object shot accross the sky, flying from WEST to EAST, and appeared to fly beyond the horizon. I was sitting in my car on a beach near the City of Courtenay on the night in question.  A streak of light appeared directly in front of my view facing East. The width of the tail seemed larger than an average meteor tail, and had a greenish blue tinge to it.  The head of the source of light seemed to be fuzzy in nature, more like a fireball. The time I have given is only an estimate.;49.6620513513514;-124.998467567568
