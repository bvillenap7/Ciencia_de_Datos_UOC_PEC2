At 7:50 pm on March 21, 2020, I noticed two yellow lights in the sky overlooking the valley facing north from Saltwell Road, Enderby, the objects were fairly close to each other.  I went to get my glasses and my camera because I realized they were not planes.  As I watched, I saw another UFO come out from the western sky and move eastwardly, then another, then another one.  There were at least 6 to 8 of them together and moving slowly easterly, I was like what on earth is it.  I went outside and watched from the deck and I took a 5 second video and a few photos.  I went back in and watched until they all dissappeared to the east.  It lasted for approximately 5 to 7 minutes.;50.5536;-119.1316
