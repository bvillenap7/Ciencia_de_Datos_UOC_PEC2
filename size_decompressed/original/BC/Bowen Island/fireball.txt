12 Orange UFO's that looked like fireballs.;2015-11-07 21:00:00;15 minutes;12 Orange UFO's that looked like fireballs. This was unbelievable.  I live on Bowen Island on the west coast, I was sitting on the couch this evening when from the corner of my left eye I saw a bright orange light.  I went to the back of the house where the bedroom is located and I saw what looked to me like a plane on fire.  It was a bright orange ball of what looked like fire travelling fast across the sky.  Then ... it just stopped. A few seconds later it carried on toward the ferry terminal over Snug Cove.  Then another one appeared from the same direction, then another and another.  Over 15 minutes about 12 of the objects flew over my house or just off to the north.  It was unreal, when I realized the first one was not a plane on fire my paranoia kicked in and I immediately thought it was a missile.  I felt progressively worse after about 7 of these things because to me one is a sighting but 12 is an invasion or at-least a serious desire to demonstrate that they know your watching.  They definitely wanted! to be seen, low in the sky and all travelling from the same direction and flying toward West Vancouver like 12 balls of fire.  I would be shocked if thousands of people did not witness this and I would be lying if I didn't say that it scared me.;49.3848;-123.331
