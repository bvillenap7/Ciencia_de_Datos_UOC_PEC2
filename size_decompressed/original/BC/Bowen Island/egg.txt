I saw what looked like I though a meteor heading towards me. ((anonymous report)) ((NUFORC Note:  Venus??  PD));2017-02-22 20:50:00;15 minutes;I was watching tv earlier on this evening roughly after 8pm or 830 pm.  I all of a sudden caught a glare from the corner of my eye a light.  When I only had the lights on the upper level and not the lower set.  I walk to the lower level and I saw what looked like I though a meteor heading towards me.  At least that's what I could explain it. I tried to look through the telescope but because they are uva treated ect.  I couldn't get any thing.  I am on the south side of bowen Island and it was before vancouver island.  On the left side between smaller islands.  This was changing color.  I took out a set of binocolars and went outside.  To my amazement when I looked through my binocolars this was not a round shape as I thought but egg shaped and covered with thousand of what I though lights.  This was stationary in the air but my hands were very shaky.  It was like a breathing thing.  In the sense there was another one on another angle but to the up right angle higher up and that the lights of the ship would otherwise completely light up or only a portion of it.   The other one would also have completly different pattern.  I did get my video cam out and only got one of the crafts on it.  Although when I increase the pic it looks like a ball that is morphing and changing colour shape. I am wondering if anyone else saw this tonight??
