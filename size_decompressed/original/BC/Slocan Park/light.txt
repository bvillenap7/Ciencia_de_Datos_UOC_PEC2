HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  A glowing white ball dropped from the sky.;2003-10-01 22:40:00;few seconds;Hi Brian,  You won't believe this, or on second thought, I'm sure you will. I'm writing to report a UFO sighting. It's not that exciting, but here it is.  On Wednesday night, October 1, 2003, I was taking a bath. I have a large window over the bathtub facing the Northwest and I like to look at the stars. At approximately 10:40 pm., a glowing white ball dropped from the sky. It did not descend at an angle as meteorites tend to do, nor did it have a green cast. It was absolutely white and it came straight down at very high speed with a white tail of light behind it. It appeared to be fairly close by in that I could see that the object was round. Looking at a map the next day, I determined the exact area my window faces.  It seems likely to me that it came down in the Southern half of the Little Slocan Valley, near Valican, unless the object was huge and therefore, further away.  Thank you to the witness for the report.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.
