I observed I believe 5 to 6 objects flying towards south in a cluster, and it seemed to to me that they were trying to get in some sort of formation as it seemed the organization seemed unorganized moving from north to south, at the point they seemed to get in some sort of organization, they disappeared from sight.  I had seen approx. 12 satellites this night, and this was something I have never seen before.   I wish I had a video recorder as this was very interesting....;54.0549;-128.6531
