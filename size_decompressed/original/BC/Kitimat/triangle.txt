Three light triangle moving and revolving slowly.;2015-09-01 22:00:00;5 minutes;Three light triangle moving and revolving slowly. I was sitting on the front stairs of our townhouse, smoking and playing a game on my phone.  I looked up and saw three orange lights in a triangle formation slowly revolving and slightly moving north east.  There was no sound and the lights appeared about 100 metres or less in front and above.  After watching it for about 30 seconds, I got up and opened our front door and called my wife to come quickly.  She came and saw the lights and said with no doubt in her voice, “oh cool, a UFO.”.  I have been a lifelong skeptic so I had a hard time grasping this, though I had no other explanation for this sighting. It stayed a few more minutes, slowly revolving though no longer moving in any direction and gradually revolved slower and the lights became dimmer until it was no longer there at all.  For the duration I barely took my eyes away from it and there was no noise whatsoever.  I have told almost no one about this.  I understand that few would believe me.;54.0549;-128.6531
