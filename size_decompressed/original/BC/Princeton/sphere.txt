Seemed to move in repeated designs and flashed mssgs to two other simular objects, one to the southwest, the other west. A falling star caught our attention, then suddenly the sky lit up and a huge white ball streaked across above us. I beleive I heard reports of meteor showers... My husband,aged 21, our daughters aged 11 & 7, and myself sat around a campfire. The kids were getting ready to go to sleep when we spotted the lights. I recall sitting in the lawnchair with my husband standing behind me. The kids had gone to bed and I noticed the lights in a barely moving pattern, like a pyramid shape that spiraled inward. Another repeated movement was short distance spikes, like an EEG reading. I don't have any idea of how long we watched, but I do recall seeing a shooting star. My husband remembers that too, but right after that the sky lit up with a brilliant ball of white! I KNOW that I asked him repeatedly, Did you see that?  After that we put out the fire and went to sleep in the tent.  We never really talked about it until last summer, and I would really be intrested to find out what it was we, or I saw.;49.4208928571429;-120.565889285714
