HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Round red ball of brilliant light.;2003-08-14 23:20:00;5 to 6 seconds;A husband and wife were traveling back home from Salmo to Nelson, British Columbia. They were driving on Highway #6 and along side the Salmo River when to their right flying at the top of the mountain was a round red ball of brilliant light. The witnesses said it moved very quickly, to fast to be an airplane and hugged the contour of the mountain. Due to there being some distance between them and the red light, no sound was heard. The total time they watched the light was approx: 6 to 7 seconds at tops. I was also told that others traveling on the highway had also witnessed the same red light as some folks were discussing what they saw back in their home town.  Thank you to the witness for the report.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.

Red/Blue light hovering over Nelson, B.C., Canada's Bridge;2009-12-20 19:23:00;30 minutes;Red/Blue light hovering over Nelson, B.C., Canada's Bridge Me and my little sister were in are Hot Tub that my family obtained through renting our house.  It was positioned on the side of the nearby mountain overlooking the city.  It was winter and cold and when we looked at the bridge that crossed the lake,  There was a red light hovering above the bridge.  It flashed blue, then red, the blue, then red.  We sat there watching it, moving to different angles.  At first we thought it was steam, but we moved to the front yard where the steam didn't affect the view and it was still there.  After about 30 minutes, I went to get a camara.  But when me and my sister returned.  It was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

2 dim lights travelling in a line across the sky followed by 3 more in a triangle formation  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-04-07 21:22:00;2 minutes;2 dim lights travelling in a line across the sky followed by 3 more in a triangle formation and 1 more travelling from horizon upward. my girlfriend and I were out back of the property we live on looking up at the sky.  i noticed a dim light  no different from a distant star travelling a lot faster than a plane across the sky towards the moonlight just off course of the moon, with another one travelling in the exact same line but miles away from the first, they both seemed to disappear into the moonlight. not 5 seconds later, three more followed in the same line in a very large triangle formation followed by a single one that went from the horizon upwards into the darkness, instead of across the sky like the others.  the first five moved at a similar rate of speed, whereas the last moving from the horizon upward moved slightly quicker. neither of the objects made a noise, or left a trail.;49.5005;-117.2864
