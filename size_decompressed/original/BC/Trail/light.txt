Light leading another.  ((NUFORC Note:  International Space Station over flight, followed by Russian re-supply capsule.  PD));2010-07-03 22:35:00;3 minutes;Light leading another. I got out of my vehicle when I got home after work. I saw a large light leading a small light (Like the large light was towing the small light).  This caught my attention because it wasn't emitting any sounds. I watched this object travel across the horizon at a constant speed till it was behind the mountains.  The leading light was much brighter and the trailing light was smaller and dimmer with a few different colours.
