D shape, not delta,  with red strip tail lights during lunar eclipse;1997-03-23 21:00:00;2 to 3 minutes;D shape, not delta,  with red strip tail lights during lunar eclipse Glancing out the window to monitor the progress of the lunar eclipse, I witnessed a D-shaped craft (not delta, >, but rather D), rounded at the front with a strip of red lights flashing across the straight edge,  similar to the rear of a 60's/70's car that had a single strip of tailights running all the way across the back.   It appeared to come out of the west or northwest and flew east or southeast over the Knob at Nanoose Bay.  It seemed to be quite low as it passed over the top of the Knob, and on out over the Georgia Strait. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
