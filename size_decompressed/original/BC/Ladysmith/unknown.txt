Fast Star light craft heading south, erratic movement including zig zag, 90 degree turns and shar curves;2004-06-21 23:15:00;2 Minutes;Fast Star light craft heading south, erratic movement including zig zag, 90 degree turns and shar curves Me and a friend were out side and just talking when I looked up to notice a small dot moving along from a north direction. I pointed this out saying Look at that satilite book it. Soon after a large plan (looked like a jumbo jet based on wing profile) coming from north heading in a south direction (probably towards Victoria Airport)  The dot suddenly changed its course so now it was moving infront of the plan heading south as well at a slightly faster pace. The dot continued to move infront of the plan then suddenly made a sharp 90 degree turn so now it was heading west again.  It preceded to make several erractic turns, one being another 90 degree turn and second being a wide curve. After doing this and moving its self a good 1/3 of the visable sky (from out point of view) it proceded to head in a straight line.  After a few seconds of this it started to zig zag back and forth, almost 1 to 2cm from our point of view. It was now heading about south west. It did a couple more small turns but seemed to continue on its new heading.  At this point the dot suddenly moved out of view (while the plane being far away is yet still visable) and was gone. This happened all in about 1 to 2 minutes and was rather astounding.  (Orginaly posted by me at ufocity.com on the night of the sighting);48.9828;-123.8254
