My boyfriend and I decided to go for a walk last Tuesday night (March 13th/01).  It was a clear and starry night with a few scattered clouds and a waning moon.   I was stargazing when something caught the corner of my eye. It was round, about 10 feet in diameter, about 3000 feet in altitude.  It was glowing orange and yellow and had a little tale behind it about one eighth of its diameter.  It flew over us heading east and made no sound at all.   I watched it until it got to about the middle of the harbour, about a mile away.  It appeared to be getting smaller until it just disappeared, which is strange because you can see airplanes further away than that.   The time was approximately 11:45 P.M. and the sighting lasted for about 30 seconds.;48.9828;-123.8254
