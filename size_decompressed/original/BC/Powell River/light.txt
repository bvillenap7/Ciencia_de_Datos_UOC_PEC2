Bright Orange light growing in size pulsating until it vanished into thin air leaving a humid sparkly small trail.;2014-06-05 19:30:00;45 seconds;Bright Orange light growing in size pulsating until it vanished into thin air leaving a humid sparkly small trail My cousin and I were on top of a mountain we climbed to watch the sunset.  We were looking out over the ocean which over looks Texada Island and Vancouver Island.   We both noticed just over Texada there appeared to be a bright orange ball in the sky.  It never dropped height, it just stayed in one place and got brighter and brighter and bigger with a bit of pulsation to it.  After speculation of what it could be, we both felt very unpleasant, like some kind of unnatural phenomena was right in front of us.   This light stayed for about 45 seconds growing in light, it appeared like it was coming straight at us because of how the light was getting bigger and bigger until it just vanished into thin air, leaving a sparkly humid looking, very small contrail, which was most definitely not from a meteor. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite responsible sounding, and sober minded.  We suspect that the witness is a capable observer, and a reliable source of information.  PD));50.0189;-124.3231
