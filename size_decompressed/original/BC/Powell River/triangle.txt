speeding triangle at night;2001-04-20 23:00:00;3 seconds;speeding triangle at night a couple of years ago i was outside having a cigerette, and was emjoying the starry night.  i was looking south and something that was triangular flew very fast to the east, and stopped briefly. then flew out of sight. it kinda looked liked one of those new types of jets, but it was moving so fast and it stopped at a dime.  i couldnt tell how many lights there were. i would estimate about 2, maybe 3.  if there was a line going to the horizon (say 1) and a line coming straight up out of my head(90), it would have been like 50.  it looked a far ways away. i couldnt tell and am bad with distances so i could give a guess.  maybe half a km or something.

Sighted a dark triangle shaped object with 4 lights travelling west to east at high speed. At 10:50pm April 25/2001, on a cool clear night, I stepped outside to call my two cats inside. I turned around and looked north up the stairs to where one of the cats was making it's way down towards me. As I looked upwards I noticed a dark triangle shaped object with 4 lights ( 2 on each leading edge) travelling west to east at a high rate of speed.  The object was out of sight 5 seconds later, obscured by the roofline of the house.;50.0189;-124.3231
