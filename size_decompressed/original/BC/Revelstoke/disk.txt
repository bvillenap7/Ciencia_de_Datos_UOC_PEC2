My son and i were approaching a right curve in the road while driving home one evening. I said to him,  check out the helicopter up there, as i looked up at a hovering shape that sat still approx 50 feet up right infront of us(top of the tree line).  He said,ya that's weird. I saw greenish lights and what seemed to be fog around it. i looked at it for about 5 seconds then it just took off at a rate of speed that made me realize that there was no way this could be a helicopter.  It hovered motionless, tree tops were not blowing or moving like a chopper would cause to happen.  it was silent. And i've never seen something take off so fast, it was so fast!   I have always wondered, but now i am convinced we are not alone. You really do have to see something with your own eyes to believe it.  i haven't been able to get this off my mind for almost 2 years.  thank you.
