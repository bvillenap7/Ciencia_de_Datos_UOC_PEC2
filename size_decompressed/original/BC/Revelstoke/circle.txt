Blinking, rotating lights above traintrack of Revelstoke city;2001-11-22 18:25:00;few sec.;Blinking, rotating lights above traintrack of Revelstoke city I just came from work when I saw in the center of Revelstoke above the traintrack two big lines of different colors of lights above each other. The lights where blinking and the lines where rotating, so they must have been circles. The distance between the lines was about 1 meter. It was dark allready and trees where behind the object and very soon it disappeared behind the houses. I run two blocks to stand in the same street (victoriastr.)as the object but couldn't see it anymore. The UFO was at least 4 meters in diameter and moved in searching speed (not too fast)towards the east following the traintrack for what I could see.;51.0038;-118.1838
