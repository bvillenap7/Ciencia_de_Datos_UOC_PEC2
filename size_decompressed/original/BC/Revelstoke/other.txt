We took several pictures of the scenery through out our road trip but just before Rogers Pass near Revelstoke BC Canada, I snapped these three photos in succession and as you can see by the traffic and surrounding vegetation, the object seemed to be the same distance from us at each interval. We were travelling at approximately 120kmh. None of us saw or heard this object while taking these photos. It wasn't until October 4, 2012 that I sat down to look at our trip and noticed this object. It seems to have a light beam emanating from one side of it and shaped like a double sectional, curved craft of some kind. Or it might be more than one craft flying together.;51.0038;-118.1838
