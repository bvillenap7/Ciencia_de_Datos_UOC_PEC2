My friend  pointed out to me what initially looked just like a star but as you kept your eye on it you could see that it was moving steadily across the sky and while doing so it was fading to where you could almost not see it but then it started to light up again and glow strong while still moving and then again fade, glow, fade, glow, until it eventually left our sight. It looked like a very distant star but when it glowed it stood out from the rest of the stars in the sky. It was obviously very very distant, further than any plane/satelite/etc. No idea what it was but it had a great rhythmic and steady pattern of traveling across the sky while dimming and glowing, no flashing lights, no noise, and a pretty regular course, no dashing about at different speeds or in different directions. Anyone seen something similar?;50.9611;-119.1625
