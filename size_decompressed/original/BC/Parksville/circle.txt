7 colored Orbs in a staggered V shape flying towards military base in Canada.;2013-12-23 23:00:00;5 minutes;7 colored Orbs in a staggered V shape flying towards military base in Canada. Around 11:15 PM on Dec 23 2013, I went outside to unplug the Christmas lights before going to bed.  As soon as the front door opened, seven orb lights appeared in front of me in the Southern sky just above the trees.  The largest one was red, the others were orange and seemed to be following the bigger one in a half V shape slowly heading East.  There was no sound.  Maybe they were following the creek bed to the open water.  The excitement got to me, before I could grab the camera and binoculars they had disappeared out of my sight.  I will be ready for them next time with my new telescope and camera.  Sincerely, ((nickname deleted));49.3244658536585;-124.320995121951
