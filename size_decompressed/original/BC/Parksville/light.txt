The light was brighter than anything I've ever seen in the sky & hovered in one place.;2007-07-05 22:30:00;5 - 10 min;The light was brighter than anything I've ever seen in the sky & hovered in one place. The object hovered in one place & was very bright.  It appeared to be a white light with red lights flashing around it.  The light seemed sparkly.  It disappeared without a trace.  I took 2 photos of it.  Upon viewing the photos, there appears to be 2 other objects close by.  The other 2 objects were undetectable to the naked eye or through the telescope.  My computer program does not have the capacity to adequately zoom into the objects to get a clear, defined picture.  However, they do appear in the photo.  Can I send you the pictures? The 2 observers (myself & my partner) are fully functioning normal adults, not crazy, as far as we know.  We've both been involved in community service for years.  I'm highly educated, with a Master's degree.  We've never seen anything like this & were rather hesitant to file this report.  I also left a phone message.  I'm curious to know if anyone else has reported the same sighting.;49.3244658536585;-124.320995121951

3 lights over Parksville, BC.;2015-02-18 21:28:00;5 minutes;3 lights over Parksville, BC I was staying at the Beach Club Resort Hotel in Parksville, BC, Canada, my room was on the 5th floor overlooking the Strait of Georgia, toward Lasqueti Island.  While closing the curtains to my hotel room, I noticed a large orange/yellow light, slowly growing in size and intensity as it came toward me from the North. The object then slowly moved West and then two more lights started to grow and increase in intensity from the same direction as the first.  As they transited to the West, they did not gain one the first light which had started to travel away from me as the size and intensity decreased until it was no longer discernable from the few stars that were visible.  After a few minutes the remaining two also started to travel away from me in the same manner as the first until they too were just points of light. At no time during this sighting was there any sound, or rapid jumping or movement by these objects, just a slow steady transit while changing from orange, yellow and red with no apparent change in shape. ((NUFORC Note:  We know the witness from his prior report, and we consider him to be highly reliable.  PD;49.3244658536585;-124.320995121951
Several UFOs buzz cruise ships in waters off Vancouver Island.;2016-09-03 20:46:00;20 minutes;Several UFOs buzz cruise ships in waters off Vancouver Island. This is a report of what I just witnessed at 8:46pm PDT, and again at 9:06pm PDT, on the evening of Saturday, Sept. 3, 2016, while watching two cruise ships on a web cam. While watching a cruise ship go past a web cam, situated at Columbia Beach, Parksville, BC, Canada I saw, at first one, and then at least two more, lights flying across the sky from right to left, which would be roughly east to west.  The camera faces more or less north. Here is a link to the camera. http://www.bigwavedave.ca/webcams.php?cam=2 The first cruise ship was the 'Nieuw Amsterdam' at 8:46pm. (Yes that's how they spell it) Moments after the last light went to the west, it appeared as though several (Perhaps 3) dimmer lights went from west to east, or left to right, directly over the ship. I hope to include a file (PeterD.zip) with representative photos of the day and night view from this camera, as well as the paths that the lights took. As the second cruise ship, the 'Coral Princess' passed, at 9:06pm, a similar display occurred, but with only one light. It also passed in both directions. As you will see from the edited photos (Sorry no actual shots of the lights), the lights did not stay illuminated across the entire field of the camera. It appeared as though they were only interested in /illuminated when close to, the cruise ships. As this camera switches from normal colour to low light when darkness falls, the actual brightness of the objects/lights is impossible to gauge. All I can say, is that I thought I had seen a meteor at first. But after the entire display, I can't imagine how that many meteors traveling in both directions could have occurred in such quick succession. This report is true and factual to the best of my ability to recall. ((name deleted)) in Nanaimo.;49.3244658536585;-124.320995121951
