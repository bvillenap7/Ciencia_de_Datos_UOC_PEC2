The time was around 7:10pm..i got this strange feeling to look outside my window..plus i was just about too get up to close my sliding glass door. and happend to look out side. and i noticed a bright orange light (the same colour ive seen before) at first i thought it was a street light..but then when i went out onto my deck i noticed it was above the trees and about 300 or more feet upinto the air. i'm not sure how long it was out there for, but i was probably watching it for about 10 minutes. at first i thought it was a flare, but flares don't stay suspened in the air for 10mins, they usually die out bye then. aswell, there was a police helicopter near by my building (on the 4th floor) and i saw that it was headed over there, (so i suspect it wasn't a flare) a few minutes later it reached the location around where the 'ufo..strange orange light' was scene, the police helicopter circled the area for several minutes. it was just off vancouver island..(parksville) i'm certain it was like the one bright orange light i have scene onec before a few years back. i'm sorry i can't give any more descriptions..it was like i was in a trance just looking at this orange light..(might sound silly..but thats what it felt like too me) oh, when the police helicopter went near it, the VERY BRIGHT (almost blinded) light went out..or dissapeared....;49.3244658536585;-124.320995121951
