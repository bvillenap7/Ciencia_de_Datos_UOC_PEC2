I was driving home from Victoria on ruite to Nanaimo that night, when I noticed what I thought was a low flying plane. When looked at it closer, I realized it wasn't an airplane--it was far too big and low to be a plane. It was a lit up flying disk with symetrical light formations on the bottom of it the lights seemed to blink upwards as bubbles do in a fish tank or something. The was a bit of farm land to my right as I driving, and the ocean was visible and not far from the highway i was on. The night was incredibly clear, I could see almost every star perfectly. I became so shocked while I was driving that I had to pull over to make sure my eyes weren't playing tricks on me. I noticed about 2 other cars pull over behind me and we all got out and just stared at this huge disk hovering over the bay. i was in complete shock and all the hair on my arm went straight up. The disk made an eerie whirring noise that was almost ghostly. The exact location was just after the McDonalds and Tim Hortons Drive through in Mill Bay (just after the malahat drive). I also noticed it was quite windy out. Once I pulled over I realized that it was indeed some sort of UFO. I am quite a skeptical person therefore, I am still having problems rationalizing this in my head. Thus, I am writing down what happened here.
