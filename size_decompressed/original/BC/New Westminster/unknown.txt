Odd moving bright light over New westminster;2013-05-25 03:30:00;15 seconds (?);Odd moving bright light over New westminster I don't recall the exact time I saw the object (approx 40 mins prior to my sending this), but right after I did I came on the web to google how to file a report.  I've had quite a bit to drink tonight and I'm rather skeptical, but I've lived here for about 8 years...see planes, satellites (?), and helicopters on a pretty regular basis, and what I saw tonight was completely unusual.   There was an object in the sky headed in a direction (North - east I think (?) that I can't recall any plane headed in ever here.  It was very bright, like helicopter, but looked much further away with a bigger, brighter light (an assumption based on the distance that it appeared) than what I'm familiar with.   When I first saw it, I immediately thought it was very unusual, and tried to keep my eyes on it, but it slowly zig-zagged while moving north I think and moments later was out of range. When I say slow, I mean way faster than a plane, but not like an illusion of teleporting ! like what someone might perceive when drinking, as a result of that whole double vision effect.   I smoke and drink, so I've been outside inebriated literally hundreds of times.  I spend a lot of time looking up at the sky, watching all sorts of odd lights fly by (assuming what isn't a plane, is either a helicopter, or satelite, but this was very, very different (Its light looked different, and it moved really funny (side to side), so in case there's another report from the area,  I just thought I'd back that up as a witness, because it was just nothing like I've ever seen before around here.;49.2007879999999;-122.922412
