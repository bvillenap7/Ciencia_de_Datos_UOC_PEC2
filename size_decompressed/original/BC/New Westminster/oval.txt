Lights over New Westminster.;2013-11-10 20:00:00;20 minutes;Lights over New Westminster At about 8:00 o'clock pm I went out onto my patio to start the BBQ when I looked out into the sky. I saw 3 strong red lights in the southwest sky. I immediate called my wife to come out and have a look. At this point the original 3 had moved up into the sky and disappeared and 3 others had appeared rising into the sky. We both went into the house to get out phones and she started to video the event and I took still pictures. This lasted for about 15 minutes.;49.2007879999999;-122.922412
