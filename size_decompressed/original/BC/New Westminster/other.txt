We were lying in a tent watching the stars at night, and then one of my family members came out and started talking. Before they went back inside me and my friend both turned quickly to look at this bright streak of light that had gone past, and when we looked at it, it was gone. My family member didn't gat a chance to see it because it went by so fast. Then again we talked to the family member for a short while, and as they left we saw another one, It was a very large white streak. Later that night we saw more. They were as wide as 1/4 of the moon and went 1/5 of the way across the sky and dissapeared. Quickly ((NUFORC Note:  Perseid Meteor shower occurred on this night.  We assume the witness means a date of August 12, not 13.  PD));49.2007879999999;-122.922412
