The object was round 1/16 in dia and was yellow in color. There was a small bright circle in the center with three black dots in the circle.This was followed by a black ring,bright ring,black ring,bright ring and a finale black ring. There was a bright aura around the edge of the object.Every so often the rings would change in to what looked like a spiral pattern. At his point I woke up my seven year old sun to come and take a look.He said it looked like a bullseye in the sky. The object would move around a area about 6 in in diameter then it finaly stopped and stayed stationary and moved with the rest of the stars crossing the sky.I found it interesting how the background sky would pass out of veiw as time went on but this just stayed put until it moved with the rest of the skyscape.I watched it until 02:00 when clouds coverd my view.;49.2007879999999;-122.922412
2 Disc shaped gray objects seen over New Westminster;2002-10-09 15:21:00;25 - 30 Seconds;2 Disc shaped gray objects seen over New Westminster This isn't the first time I've sent in a report to your website.  I'm kind of dissapointed that over the last 2 months I've witnessed several bizzare objects in the sky with a witness, but didn't report them to you and I should have.  I'm a very observant of the skies due to the fact that I've seen many of these ojects in my life. Today, on my last coffee break of the day 3:15 P.M., I wondered down 7th Street in New Westminster, B.C., Canada.   This is how my sighting transpired. I noticed in the sky what appeared to be some floating garbage or black balloons of some type which seemed to be liked together like a cluster of balloons with a definate arrow shape to the mass.  This seemed a little odd and puzzling this shape.  The distance of this floating garbage or ballons when I first spotted it was probably 20 stories high compared to the height of a high rise building.   Whatever this was flying up in the air, I just thought, it's got to be garbage and didn't think anything much of it, but I did continue to watch this (garbage) float upwards with what I assume was air currents moving it upwards.  As my head was looking up towards the sky in an easterly direction at this floating garbage, I caught sight of a disc shaped grey object moving rapidly skimming the clouds and moving fast and steady from an easterly direction towards a south western direction.  It moved smoothly across the sky from the East and curved on an angle towards a South Westerly direction.  I watched it move across the sky till infinity (I couldn't see it anymore).  I had a fix on this object for at least 30 seconds crossing the sky.  It wasn't a bird or small plane.  Stunned at what I saw, and frankly, if it wasn't for that (garbage thing) floating upwards, I probably wouldn't have seen this object at all. I looked in the sky where I originally had first spotted the object (which was in the easterly sky) and about 45 seconds to 1 minute after the pass of the first object, there was a second flying object of similar size, heading from an Easterly direction towards a definate Southern direction.  At the moment that I spotted this second object, there was an airliner in the sky heading towards Vancouver airport.  This object was much higher than the plane, and this 2nd object also was skimming the clouds as well. That's all I have right now, plain and simple, but I wanted to get this one to you for sure this time.;49.2007879999999;-122.922412
By the colour,the way the object moved and hovered, you could tell it was not a plane or a satlelite.;2003-07-17 12:50:00;Aprox;By the colour,the way the object moved and hovered, you could tell it was not a plane or a satlelite. -The weather was hot, 26 degrees. Blue clear sky. -I saw a bright white light slowly traveling to my left. -Shape was round. -Size and visual look would be the same as if you looked at a star at night. -The object had no sound that I could hear. -The object traveled slowly to my left for aprox. 6 sec. It looked like it was moving on a angle to the left. -The object stopped for 2 seconds then went right for 3 seconds and hovered for aprox 6 seconds. -The object then traveled tot he right for 4 seconds, then went left again in a straight line. -The object continued that way until I could not see it anymore, due to my view. -All together, I had the object in my view for about 5 to 6 minutes. I phoned 911 and made a report.;49.2007879999999;-122.922412

Points of Light Travelling Across the sky.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-04-07 22:00:00;15 minutes;Points of Light Travelling Across the Sky Last night around 10 pm I took my dog outside fro one last bathroom break and noticed a small white light flying fast across the night sky, suddenly, I saw a small flash and another white light appeared and was travelling in the same direction and seemed to be at the same speed.  Then another flash and white light appeared.  in the first round, i saw a total of 10 lights appear and then disappear around the same spot in the sky. They all seemed to travel at the same time speed and in the same direction. Once they disappeared i watched the sky fro a few minutes, when suddenly a small flash appeared slightly further south from the first one i saw, but continued in the same direction as the first ten. then suddenly another flash,etc. I watched another twelve light in total this 2nd time. They all traveled at the same speed, distance from each other, in the same direction and disappeared in the same spot in the sky.;49.2007879999999;-122.922412
