disc   8 secs. shiney;2003-08-11 19:20:00;7 mins.;disc   8 secs. shiney On Aug.11,2003, Aprox.1820hrs, I videoed taped a daylight, round object.I was first sitting in the living room eating, I heard my wife yell,___ come here,___ come here! When I got out on the patio, I noticed a cigar shaped object, I then ran inside too get my video camcoder, I started taping straight at the object,but could not get it into focus, finnally I zoomed in on it and I thought it was a frisbee, then noticed it was metal, shining, I continued to tape, It leveled off and turned black, at one moment, it looked like a hockey puck, I lost it on the view finder, then I could still see it with my naked eye in the distance, I tryed to zoom in at it again, I did for only a brief couple of frames. It was not hoovering, but flying, no sound, It was flying on it's side at first, then leveled off, I also noticed a black hole, or void in the center of the object.;49.2007879999999;-122.922412
