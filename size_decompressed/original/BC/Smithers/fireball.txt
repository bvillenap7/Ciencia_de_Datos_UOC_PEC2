We look up and see a glowing reddish yellow ball in the sky, we joke and say it's Santa, but then realize it's not a helicopter or a plane.  It was kind of pulsating and changing colour from  yellow to red.  It moved slowly for a minute or two, and then just stopped for another minute, and then it moved a little bit and disappear into the sky as we watched it.  I did take a bad video, but you can still see it.;54.7684;-127.1673
