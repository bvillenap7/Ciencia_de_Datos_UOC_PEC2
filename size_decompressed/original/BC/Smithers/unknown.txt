HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  A huge orange ball with a very short tail;2003-10-02 19:15:00;2 minutes;Good evening,  My wife and kids were driving home from town, pulling up the last stretch of road to our driveway. We live behind and beyond Lake Kathlyn, at the end of (deleted by HBCC UFO). Approx. 7:15 PM, my wife and son , suddenly said WHAT is that? In the sky heading north was , relatively speaking ,a huge orange ball with a very short tail , at the time I didn't think it was going that fast, but from high in the sky to disappearing behind the  horizon was probably less than two minutes, we had actually pulled right, down another street to keep it in sight between the trees , but it was quickly out of sight. It literally looked like a rocket on takeoff, was there a launch?, was it a meteor? Did anyone else see anything? Feel free to call if needed.  I will have a look around and call the folks who made the report.  Thank you to the witnesses for this report.
