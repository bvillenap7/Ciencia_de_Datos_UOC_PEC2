HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  The object was described as being very flat, silver in color.;2003-10-09 14:35:00;10 minutes;The object was described as being very flat, silver in color. I just received a report today and I must say this one is a strange one, but interesting. Four witnesses who were near the Driftwood fossil beds just outside of Smithers British Colombia watched a strange looking object for approx: 10 minutes.  The object was described as being very flat (almost looking like a wing of an aircraft), silver in color and very long. It appears the sun was reflecting off it, as it was shinning very brightly. One of the witnesses described the tips of the object as being like a jet's wing tips, slightly bent upwards. The witnesses told me the object stayed stationary in one spot, but from time to time it did move from side to side. The fellows also noted that there was a line of red lights running along the object. The folks watched the lights move from the tips of it into the center of the object then disappear. The red lights continued the same pattern over and over again while it sat stationary.  As the object was leaving the area where it was first located, it grew smaller and smaller due to it moving into the  distance. But before they lost sight of it,  they noticed that it started growing in size, and all the witnesses said it grew some 3 to 4 times larger then just vanished. In other words it just blinked out.  Thank you to the witness for the report.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.
