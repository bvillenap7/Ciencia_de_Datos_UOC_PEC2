The light then paused for a moment. and then ascended slowly, straight up until it vanished. Date is approximate (fairly close though since I only lived in Richmond for about 9 months).;49.1620976525822;-123.117647887324
Richmond, BC -  Jan 31/04 - 4:am - Odd rushing air sound and a row of four lights hovering in the sky which quickly disappeared.;2004-01-31 04:00:00;25 minutes;Richmond, BC -  Jan 31/04 - 4:am - Odd rushing air sound and a row of four lights hovering in the sky which quickly disappeared. 3:10am - My wife awoke to feed our 9 month old son and then returned to bed and sleep.  3:35am - She was jerked awake by a rushing noise (like air under pressure) she looked out to see if anything was going on and couldn't see anything.  The sound stopped as quickly as it had started.  4:00am She woke again to a flickering light (like sheet lightening) in the bedroom and thinking it was lightening waited for the thunder to come.  When there was no thunder sound she thought this was weird and once again looked out our bedroom window (facing east) and saw four lights stationary in the sky, which then quickly disappeared (travelling away from her).  I woke up while she was looking out the window and there was no question that she was awake and actually saw something.  We live in the flightplath of Vancouver International Airport and are quite fimiliar with commercial airplanes, military craft, helicopters and such.  The airplanes that night were all flying inbound from the east, while the lighted object as on a different flightpath and was travelling to the east (opposite to the planes).  About 6 years ago I had a strange encounter at the exact same time 4:00am in the same house.  I awoke to our stove emitting a sound that it doesn't make and the digital clock on the stove was flashing alpha characters (it only does numeric) it has never done this before or after.  One of our sensor lights was on in the backyard and although I didn't see anything, my Aunt who lives downstairs did see something leaving our yard at the same time.  When I returned to the bed, there was a flickering light that seemed to come from one of the wall sockets and the same sound that she experienced.  We have not been able to find an explanation to this day.  Thanks;49.1620976525822;-123.117647887324
HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Object moving in a slow, steady path from south to north.;2004-02-11 23:30:00;3 half hours;Shape of objects: Round - changing Full Description of event/sighting: My mom and I witnessed a very bright white object moving in a slow, steady path from south to north. Not knowing if it was a planet or satellite, etc.,  I grabbed my video camera and filmed the object for about a half hour.  The film shows the object spinning at very high speed and maintaing a round shape. Then, it seems to split in two, come back together, and now spins at high speed , but VERY odd shape changes the whole time. Every time I freeze frame the object, the shape is different.  So - can I send you a copy of the video, as an email attachment or other method? We would like to know if we are just seeing a natural object or a genuine UFO.  Thanks,  Thank you to the witness for their report.  HBCC UFO Research believes what the witnesses were viewing was a planet.
