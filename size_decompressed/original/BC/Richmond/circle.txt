Bright blue white light fading in and fading out within 5 seconds;2013-08-08 21:12:00;5 seconds;Bright blue white light fading in and fading out within 5 seconds. While watching the transit of the ISS I saw a similarly sized, color and brightness object within 1 degree of ISS track. My assumption was it was an Iridium flare. The flare was not listed on my IF app. It was very typical in terms of fade in fade out and duration of an iridium flare.
