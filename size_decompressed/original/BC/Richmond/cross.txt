Bright pink lights appears on North Richmond Sky;2012-11-12 22:17:00;20 seconds;Bright pink lights appears on North Richmond Sky Driving on Shell Rd. heading North 1/2 block from Bridgeport Road, Richmond, BC. A very bright pink light appears suddenly in the sky at 10:17 PM.  It resembles a shape of a cross. The location is roughly above Fraser River.  The area is near YVR airport.  Many aircrafts pass by this neighbourhood at all times.  But nothing like that shape and colour.  I told my kid of 17 years of age to look up.  As we stared at the mysterious bright pink light it suddenly dropped rapidly.  It was falling so quick we thought it would crash.  Then as we looked the light just vanished right in front of our eyes in the thin quiet sky.  The whole sighting was about 20-30 seconds.  Not enough time to grab a phone to record it.;49.1620976525822;-123.117647887324
