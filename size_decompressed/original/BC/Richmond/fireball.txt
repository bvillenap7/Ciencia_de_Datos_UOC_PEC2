This is when I first noticed it. A tear drop shaped fireball with continued in a straight line from the vapour trail and then made a curved drop below the mountains to the east. It was between Mt. Baker to the right and the rising sun to the left. To the farther left of the sun was another vapour trail and two smaller ones below it. These seemed farther eastward than the fireball. Can send a roughly drawn description if you are even slightly interested. Thought it might be MORE of those Russian rocket boosters.;49.1620976525822;-123.117647887324
UFO Fireball Sighting.;2014-01-01 01:00:00;5 minutes;UFO Fireball Sighting. My wife and I were chatting with the blinds drawn as we looked out our apartment window. We saw a single light, looked like a fireball and we thought it was an aircraft with bright lights as the weather was a bit foggy.  About one minute later we saw another “light” closely following the first.  We went outside onto our porch as this seemed strange as aircrafts do not follow that closely and suprisingly there were no sounds as a low flying aircraft would make.  Then we saw another light following the 2nd.  There were therefore, three of these “fireball” type lights travelling in a horizontal motion. Then, the 1st light slowed down and descended toward the ocean or probably some other direction and faded.  The other two continued on, maintained a distance within each other and did the same.  By the time we got our camera out, it was gone.  It is 1.18 am and the fog has cleared at least by 50% and we are now wondering if these unidentified flying objects, “fireballs”, were using the fog as a cover whilst travelling.  Interesting Indeed would not believe unless we saw.  Amazing, there really are things out there.;49.1620976525822;-123.117647887324
Meteor/fireball looking object seen.;2014-07-13 22:00:00;10;Meteor/Fireball looking object seen. Standing outside in Richmond, looking towards the North Shore Mountains, and saw a fire-ball looking light.   At first we thought that it might be an meteor or a plane on fire that was about to crash into the mountain.   As it moved, a long tail trailed the large fire-ball east and suddenly stopped moving for a few seconds and dispersed into two fire-ball objects.   They then started going back west and stopped again and looked to have disappeared.   The fire-ball light had gone and now they started to flicker with a blue and white light.  They had turned again and traveled east fast and upwards.  It was very strange how it had gone from a large fire-ball looking object to a smaller flickering object.   The whole experience and now knowing that there is something out there is very unsettling.;49.1620976525822;-123.117647887324
Huge fireball orb above YVR Airport Vancouver, Canada.;2017-04-23 01:05:00;12 minutes;Huge fireball orb above YVR Airport Vancouver Canada Around 1:05 am, I noticed a huge fireball orb in the sky.  After zooming in the picture, I noticed something in the middle.  The ball never moved an inch, and stayed for about 12 minutes.  I found it a little strange it was so close to the airport. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness does not indicate a date for the sighting, so we have assigned an arbitrary one, until we hear from the witness.  PD));49.1620976525822;-123.117647887324
