Triangular object travelling at very high speed with three light with no audiable sound = UFO?;2006-04-04 21:22:00;6 seconds;Triangular object travelling at very high speed with three light with no audiable sound = UFO? A very quiet and clear sky night with lots of star in the sky. I was smoking outside of my house looking up the sky to check out the beautiful sky. I saw an (triangular) object with 3 dim lights travel at a rather high speed from east to west. I live rather close to the airport so I can tell what kind of normal airplane speed looks like up in the sky. What I saw was a high speed UFO with three dim lights travelling at a high speed without any audiable sound. I waited for at least for another 10 secs to see if sound can be heard. There was absolutely no sound. I couldn't really see the shape of the object because the it was dark but I certainly saw three dim lights with identical intensity.;49.1620976525822;-123.117647887324
