A formation of lights appeared to the west of the city, almost dim, moving in  perfect diamond formation. They were moving south over the water for 4-5 minutes before they shot up into the air extremely fast, disappearing from sight, faster than any man-made craft could be capable of. The air around and between the lights was lighter than the surrounding sky, probably being structure of some sort.;49.1620976525822;-123.117647887324
