dark oval like object crossed in sky while driving on highway near chilliwack making stereo go warbly / off pitch like battery failing;2006-12-09 06:11:00;5 seconds;dark oval like object crossed in sky while driving on highway near chilliwack making stereo go warbly / off pitch like battery failing was driving to chilliwack down highway 1.  suddenly the CD i was playing seemed to slow down as if battery was failing...but it didnt slow down it kinda got warbly...like when trying to start a car that won't start.... anyways, it is hard to describe but it was off pitch....   i also felt a kinda shock in my neck...not sure if related... i think my lights dimmed too...not 100% on that...i thought my battery was having problems anyways..which startled me because i was driving 100Km/hr.... then i saw a fast moving dark shape in the sky out front of my truck...it was flying at an angle ..only saw it for a moment because it crossed my path.... at first i thought it was a helicopter..but it was very low....very dark (no lights) and moved very silently except it seemed there was a bass like sound as it went in front/overtop of me.  then it was gone and the stereo was back to normal...i couldnt stop because i was on the highway...so thats all i  can say. dont even know if it was anything...but it was a little chilling.;49.1094159235668;-121.948261146497
