Red light and bright white flash seen to the West;2003-05-01 22:30:00;15 minutes;Red light and bright white flash seen to the West I looked to the west as my mom was driving me home from work and I saw a red flashing light just to the left of the mountains. It was flashing consistently and sitting in one spot. I told my mother to stop the car as we were on a back road that had little traffic. I rolled down my window and looked the red light. We noticed that it would move south horizontally in little spurts, but mostly stayed in one spot. We drove home and I walked out into the road to see if we could see it from there. I could just see it over the roof of a house, and my mom was standing a bit farther over and she was watching it as well with no obstruction. I noticed the light drop down a bit, beyond my view, and I thought I had slouched or something, so I stood up a bit straighter, but the light dropped down again. I moved over to where my mom was standing, and we observed it clearly. It was staying in one place again. My mother went to go unlock the door of the house, so I was left alone to watch it. Suddenly a bright flash of light came from about the same place I'd initially seen the red light when we were driving. My mom had noticed the flash, and she said it looked like a plane, but it didn't happen again until a few seconds later, closer to the (then)current location of the red light. The white flash didn't happen again while I was observing the sky. I looked back at the red light and I saw that it had faded a bit, and the flashing wasn't as brilliant. At this time, I went inside, so I'm not sure if it remained there, or if the white flash happened again after I left. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke at length with this witness, and she seemed quite lucid, and credible, to us.  Her description of the lights she witnessed did not seem to us to be consistent with the erratic strobe pattern of a typical helicopter.  PD));49.1094159235668;-121.948261146497
HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  looking up in the sky I saw a very bright light.;2003-09-10 05:00:00;not known;looking up in the sky I saw a very bright light. About a week ago (say Sept 10, 2003) around 5:00 a.m., I saw the same thing in the west, southwest sky.  I woke up and let my dog out  looking up in the sky I saw a very bright light, like a star but a bit larger, and every so often it flashed different colors - red, green blue.  At first I thought it was a plane but it did not move. Then suddenly it shifted sideways quite a distance, then moved in a straight line back to where it was.  I watched on and off for quite a while and the flashing lights continued but it did not seem to change position in the sky, though it seemed to shift around once in a while.  The irregular flashing of the different colored lights and the movement was unlike anything I have ever seen or heard of until I read the post from Courtenay.  Thank you to the witness for sending along the report.   Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.

I saw something thats just too unordinary hard to explain and i want answers ???;2013-07-08 21:00:00;0:07;I saw something thats just too unordinary hard to explain and i want answers ??? I was on the balcony in Chilliwack B.C., Canada, with my mom on the balcony on clear night where no clouds were in the sky, and I noticed a bright light get really bright in the sky then fade out til it got dim then was totally out.  I then noticed thre a time period of maybe between 20-30 seconds that it would then light up quickly towards the left more so in the sky, when im facing south the states, then I thought it was impossible for it to be another light lighting up again doing the same thing in repeated sequenes for about a good 100 miles in every 20-30 secs????  It just looked weird usually you see planes with flasing red lights or something but this was one bright white light blinking on and off evry 30 seconds and every 30 seconds it was a good distance from where it was last seen 30 seconds before......,. you know what I mean I really witnessed this with my mom too and ill never fotget that U.F.O. WE SAW !!!;49.1094159235668;-121.948261146497
Large bright white light in the night sky that suddenly vanished in an instant!;2021-03-25 23:15:00;30 seconds;Large bright white light in the night sky that suddenly vanished in an instant! I walked out onto the back deck of my apartment to have a smoke.  I always gaze at the stars when I’m outside at night.  I happened to look up and to the NNW and noticed a large bright white light up in the night sky, that resembled a very bright star.  I stared toward the above mentioned direction for about 30-40 seconds.  All of a sudden, as if someone flicked a light switch, the light vanished.  In a millisecond it was gone.  This light “anomaly” made no sound that I heard, and I couldn’t make out how high in the sky it was.  This was not a commercial airliner, as they have safety and flashing lights on during their flights.  Not to mention, they are quite easy to hear flying overhead, especially at night.  The light also didn’t move in any noticeable direction.  It just hovered in the same spot in the sky until it vanished.  I waited and watched in the same spot to see if it returned to view, but sadly it did not.  Not too sure what I saw.  This wasn’t a place, helicopter, satellite, or star.  The weather tonight:  9°C Wind:  ESE 3 km/h Temperature:  7.5°C Pressure:  101.8 kPa Dew point:  3.3°C Humidity:  75% Clear night sky;49.1094159235668;-121.948261146497
