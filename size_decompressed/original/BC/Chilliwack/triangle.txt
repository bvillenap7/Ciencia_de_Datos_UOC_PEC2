The crafts were quiet, fast, hovering and illuminated by several lights lining them.;2002-07-08 21:15:00;approx 1 hour;The crafts were quiet, fast, hovering and illuminated by several lights lining them. My wife, our neighbour and his wife were all sitting out in the field enjoying a bonfire (we live on a dairy farm). Airplanes pass over frequently, so at first we ignored the dull humming coming from the distace. After about 15 minutes we realized that the humming was still quite audible, now slightly louder than before. We started talking about it, trying to find the source, when out from the trees at the edge of the field hovered some type of craft about the size of an olympic size swimming pool, but triangular in shape, followed by an identical but smaller craft. They hovered only about 80-100 feet off the ground, though the sound emitted was quieter than that of a household vaccuum cleaner, and no wind or anything accompanied the low flying vehicals. They were lined with several lights, varying in size and coulour, some of which blinked liked a strobe light. After several minutes, the two vehicals were accompanied by yet another craft, the size of the smaller one mentioned before and identical to the other two. The material of the crafts was a metallic looking navy blue which faded into a green as it reached the two end points of the vehicals. They continued to hover for quite some time, never getting any louder, and they were only intimidating in their size. Finally, we heard a commercial plane nearing, and the craft flew straight up in the air, and then took off north/east in direction so fast we barely had time to blink before it was out of site.;49.1094159235668;-121.948261146497
Triangular shape of 3 light points travelling at high altitude ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of NOSS satellites.  PD));2003-08-29 22:50:00;~3 MINS.;Triangular shape of 3 light points travelling at high altitude 49.06.00 LATITUDE, -121.29.00 LONGITUDE WAS APPROX SIGHTING LOCATION. 3 MID INTENSITY SATELLITE POINTS POSITIONED IN THE SHAPE OF AN EQILATERAL TRIANGULAR WITH THE TOP VERTICE POINTING IN THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL. THE VERTICES MAINTAINED THEIR DISTANCE FROM ONE ANOTHER AND ANGLES WITH RESPECT TO EACH OTHER VERY CONSISTENTLY DURING ITS 1.5-2 MINUTE PASSAGE. MOVED OVERHEAD PROCEEDING FROM THE WEST TO THE EAST BUT CURVED TOWARD THE SOUTH EAST AFTER THE 1/2 WAY POINT. STEADY, SILENT TRAVEL SIMILAR TO A SATELLITE BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN 2 LET ALONE 3 OF THEM TRAVELLING TOGETHER AND HOLDING STATIC RELATIVE POSITIONS TO EACH OTHER. SAME SPEED SAME DIRECTION EQUAL INTENSITY. I'VE GAZED FOR SATELLITES SINCE FIRST SEEING THE ORIGINAL SPUTNIK AND THIS HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A RELATIVELY UNIQUE VIEWING EVENT. AT TIMES THE STARS PASSING THROUGH THE 'INTERIOR' OF THE TRIANGLULAR SHAPE APPEARED TO DISAPPEAR ALTHOUGH IT WAS DIFIICULT TO TELL IF THAT WAS A FUNCTION OF THE RELATIVE BRIGHTNESS OF THE 3 POINTS OF LIGHT TRAVELING TOGETHER BLOTTING OUT DIM STARS. THE 'AREA' ENCOMPASSED BY THE TRIANGULAR FORMATION WOULD CONTAIN ABOUT THE SAME AREA AS A FULL MOON WHEN IT IS DIRECTLY OVERHEAD. THE SKY WAS ABSOLUTELY CLOUDLESS, NO VISIBLE MOON NEARBY AND WE WERE IN THE MOUNTAINS AT OUR CABIN. ((NUFORC Note:  We do not know what the witnesses observed.  Our first suspicion was that the lights may have been the triplet of what are thought to be the U. S. Navy NOSS satellites.  Just a guess.  PD));49.1094159235668;-121.948261146497
Triangular, 30ft wide, low floating over chilliwack city at night, no lights, no sound, translucent white moved circle & straight;2007-05-28 00:30:00;1 mins;Triangular, 30ft wide, low floating over chilliwack city at night, no lights, no sound, translucent white moved circle & straight UFO sighting in Chilliwack  It just happened, at12:30 am on Monday, May 28th, 2007, over the UCFV campus in downtown Chilliwack... I overhead people shouting oh god, it's coming back, what is it!? so looked out the window and watched them for a minute...  There were three people out on the street, looking towards the eastern night sky, so I peered closely to see what they were watching, as it approached... It was completely silent, and erriely glowing a light greyish-white color. It was very large, at least as big as a small aircraft, mayber 30 feet across...  Triangular shaped, solid grey-white, but sort of translucent, and with faint darker ridges/fins running parallel down it's length, from 'nose' to 'tail'...  It was without any sort of lights or noises... and was moving about the same speed as a glider would, but with more control - up and down, and around in tight circles, then in a straight line... it seemed to deliberately move to observe us remarking over it, as it circled above us for about 10 seconds, and moved away, then back again... long enough for me to grab my video camera and attempt to get some footage (just has black sky, and voices of witnesses freaking out)  It circled around for about 20 more seconds, just low enough for the city lights to illuminate it to our vision, but high enough to be within the low overcast clouds... Then, quite quickly, rather than get progressively lower as a hang glider must, it moved away, rising up and to the west from us into the darkness...  I don't believe in alien visitations, but have never seen anything like this before... any comments or ideas, or any other witnesses out there? I am completely mystified, and can't simply forget about it...;49.1094159235668;-121.948261146497
Large triangles with yellowish-red dots at the corners twisting into the sky;2009-05-24 23:30:00;5-7 minutes;Large triangles with yellowish-red dots at the corners twisting into the sky About 12 or 15 yellowish-red (more red than yellow) dots began rising slowly into the sky above the horizon at about 11:30pm. Dots were definately in a trianglar formation, since they maintained an exact distance between them constantly. The dots were at the corners of some kind of craft that appeared to be twisting into the sky. Triangles were approx. 200-2000 metres (or more) across, depending on distance, which could not be determined for lack of reference or perspective.;49.1094159235668;-121.948261146497
3 lights in sky, appear connected and rotating.;2013-06-30 23:13:00;3 minutes;3 lights in sky, appear connected and rotating I was star gazing late at night. I could see the Orion constellation was coming more into view as it got darker and I began looking at the Big Dipper.  I looked back at Orion 2 minutes later and there were 3 white lights hovering directly between me and the Orion constellation.  The lights appeared over the Horsehead Nebula, forming a perfect triangle and were rotating in sync and heading west at a particularly slow pace.  After 3 minutes they had floated completely out of the Orion constellation.  The lights, which shone brighter than the stars themselves slowly dimmed and the lights disappeared. No craft was observed visually, only lights. There was no sound.;49.1094159235668;-121.948261146497
Broad daylight sighting above Yale/Young Rd;2016-06-30 14:00:00;45 seconds;Broad daylight sighting above Yale/Young Rd Between 2015-2016 One day me and my friend were on our way to work to pick up our cheques, passing by Ruth and niaomis mission skateboarding westbound on Princess Avenue I seen something above I’m not sure how high exactly I would guess 50-100 meters high directly above I seen a triangle object traveling the same direction, it must have been 15 meters in diameter I stopped and told my friend and he noticed it so we followed it to Young Rd as soon as it was above Young Rd it travelled southbound directly above Young Rd. The travel speed I am unsure of since it is hard to tell the exact size but it was a steady slow rate. As we followed it southbound young rd since that’s the direction of where our work is it continued for about half a minute, when it reached Airport Rd it must have been roughly above the chilliwack municipal airport suddenly from its steady highway speed it darted south east bound I have to guess hundreds to maybe a thousand kilometers an hour towards the United states border roughly the direction of North Cascades National Park direction.  From its steady highway speed to roughly hundreds of kilometers an hour was instantaneous and silent not a sound. Triangle shape best I can describe is from what I could see had 3 points and lights near each point, hard to tell the exact color though it seemed medium to light grey in color. So from the way it traveled seems like it was going westbound on yale until it was directly above Young rd, maybe it circled the airport I am not sure though the speed sure seemed very fast as I’m sure any jet would have been very loud this triangle object was definitely silent as I did try to listen. I couldn’t tell if it landed anywhere as when it darted southwest it soon was out of sight over the mountains in the distance within seconds.;49.1094159235668;-121.948261146497

I came out and noticed it was not balloons and it was fairly big and moving faster than the 2 single engine planes in the area.  It was 3 faint lights in a triangle shape moving almost parallel with hwy 1 in chilliwack east-west.;49.1094159235668;-121.948261146497
