Brilliant blue metallic object streaks from sky at steep angle, hit the ground.;2003-08-24 16:00:00;5 sec;Brilliant blue metallic object streaks from sky at steep angle, hit the ground. We were fishing on the Fraser River, about 3 miles upriver from the Island 22/ Chilliwack launch.  We were watching across the river to the north as there were hang gliders jumping off the clearing on the mountain top a few miles to the north. It was mid-afternoon, partly cloudy.  Three of the four people in the boat witnessed a glowing object hurl from the sky (west to east ) at an incredible velocity. We estimate is was 2-3 feet across and appeared metallic, with a bright blue glow, with some red and orange coloring also.  It streaked downward and dissapeared behind the stand of trees on the opposite shoreline.  It had the brilliance of a welding torch and did not drop straight down but came in at an angle.  The glow appeared around the object and also caused a trail of bright blue/white for many feet behind it as it fell. No sound was heard.
