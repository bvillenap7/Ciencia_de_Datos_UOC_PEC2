6 UFO's hovering erratically over stars in Chilliwack, BC.;2011-04-20 23:15:00;more than ten minutes;6 UFO's hovering erratically over stars in Chilliwack, BC. As i was letting my dog out for a piddle, i saw movement off the corner of my eye.  When i looked up it seemed to just be a bright star, but on closer inspection, it moved. I brought out my husbands binoculars to see it and it was disk shaped with flashing lights, i couldnt see TOO much more as my binoculars werent strong enough.  I brought my husband out to confirm what i saw and when we scanned for any other movement i counted 5 more ``stars`` moving.  Looking at each of them, they all had the same brightness, shape, flashing lights and movement.  I also saw what appeared to be a shooting star shoot directly to the first one i saw.  My husband has seen several UFO`s over his lifespan, this was my first sighting, i guess sightings.  I stayed outside for a half an hour just watching them, they each were hovering and moving just off of a star.  My husband and i also saw three aircraft moving in the same direction across the sky, but they looked to be jets, no standa! rd aviation lights though and they moved about as fast as a jet...I can for sure say that the 6 i saw were unidentified, not so sure about the extra 3. I was unable to take photos or videos since we dont have a strong enough camera, but my husband can attest to what i saw.;49.1094159235668;-121.948261146497
