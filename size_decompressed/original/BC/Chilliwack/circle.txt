On 04/21/12 22:00PM my family and I witnessed a strange event. My boyfriend was on the balcony when he called me out see see what he thought he was a UFO. At first I was skeptical, the object looked like a very bright glowing street light far away.  As I look closer I realized it was much too high up, and so big and bright it could have not been an airplane, nor a street light.  The glowing orb then moved a little and then it just vanished. 2 seconds later it appeared again, along with another glowing orb, they moved side by side and then eventually both orbs faded away and then immediately faded back glowing brightly.  I ran inside to get my dad while my boyfriend recorded the orbs. My dad witnessed these orbs as well.  They kept moving and vanishing.  Suddenly they were gone. We watched for a few more minutes but nothing happened. My step mom came home. I brought her to the balcony and explained the vents and showed her where we saw the orbs. Two minutes later, one orb appeared again for about 30 seconds and then faded away. After this happened, a civilian plane started circling the area. The orbs kept appearing, brighter each time, and moving between 22:00PM and 1:00AM. A helicopter was issued to patrol the area between these times. I am most definitely positive what I saw was a UFO.  I got about 10 or 11 videos of the orbs and i'm hoping to catch more tonight.;49.1094159235668;-121.948261146497

I was putting my child in for a bath when he called me on to the balcony.  I grabbed my daughter and ran out to see what was going on.  Approximately 15 miles away and approximately 2 miles up in the sky was a glowing orb. At first I was skeptical and thought it looked like a street light, but I am on balcony just about every night and I have never seen this light before. It was big, much bigger then the stars, and it had a strange white sun-like glow to it.  It started to fade away until it was completely gone.  A second later it faded back in, glowing brightly again. Instantly a second glowing orb appeared to the right of the first one.  Then the started to move a little side by side, and fade out again. This happened a few more times. I ran inside to grab my dad while my boyfriend filmed the orbs, then we watched the orbs move and fade in and out.  I ran back inside to grab the telephone to call a near by neighbor, but by the time I came back out the orbs had vanished.  We live right near the airport and have never seen these lights before.  A few camera flashes were seen around the neighborhood.  About 2 minutes later, an airplane from the airport started circling the area where the orbs were seen.  It circled about 5 times. Approximately 15 minutes later my boyfriends mother showed up.  After discussing the details and the incident we brought her on the balcony to show her where we saw the lights.  About two minutes of looking, the orb that appeared on the right the first time we witnessed them appeared again for about 40 seconds.  We got the orb fading out on video. I then called the National UFO Reporting Hotline.;49.1094159235668;-121.948261146497
