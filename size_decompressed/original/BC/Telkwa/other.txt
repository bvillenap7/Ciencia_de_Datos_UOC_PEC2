HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  ball of off white light with a ring of bright white light running around it.;2003-10-26 02:30:00;unknown;A gentleman called to report that his wife woke up at 2:30 a.m. on October 26, 2003 as she was heading to the washroom. As she passed through their home, and glancing out the large picture window she spotted a ball of off white light with a ring of bright white light running around it. The description was that it looked like the planet Saturn. The object was low in the Bulkley Valley. It was flying close to Highway #16. The fellow told me his wife watched it for a brief minute before continuing her journey to the washroom. When she came back out the object had disappeared. While his wife was observing the object, she reports that it was making all kinds of strange maneuvers.  HBCC UFO Note: I am taking a quick run out to see the folks and taking some more information on this sighting. Updates will follow.  Thank you to the witnesses for their report.
