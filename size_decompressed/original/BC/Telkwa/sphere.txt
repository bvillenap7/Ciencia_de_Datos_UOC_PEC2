HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  A large glowing white globe of lights flew very quickly over the tree tops.;2003-10-19 12:00:00;6 seconds;A large glowing white globe of lights flew very quickly over the tree tops. Telkwa, British Columbia  Date:  October 19, 2003 Time:  12:00 p.m. (midday)  I received a report from a witness who resides in Telkwa, British Columbia. Him and his son were out cutting firewood near Paradise Lake which is located approx: 6 kilometers east from Telkwa. As the fellows were loading the truck up with the firewood they cut, the son yelled out to his father to look north and just a above the tree tops. A large glowing white globe of lights flew very quickly, almost skimming the tree tops. The object was heading toward the Babine Lake area. There was not a sound heard coming from the light, matter of fact the light was maybe 300 feet away from the men when they first witnessed it.  HBCC UFO Note: I am taking a quick run out to see the folks and taking some more information on this sighting. Updates will follow.  Thank you to the witnesses for their report.
