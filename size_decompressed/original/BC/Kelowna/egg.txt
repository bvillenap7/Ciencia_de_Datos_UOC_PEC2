Large, bright  two egg-shapped orbs attached together forming oval/circular shape.;1996-08-15 21:00:00;2 minutes;Large, bright  two egg-shapped orbs attached together forming oval/circular shape. While walking past my glass patio door I noticed a large, bright egg-shaped orb hovering over the tree line about two miles away. It is the color of starlight, noiseless and non-pulsating. It appears to be two oval shapes attached together to form one, slightly more circular shape.The size of the object is at least half the size of the trees it is hovering over (50'?)My eldest daughter sees me staring outside with mouth open and walks over to witness exactly what I am seeing.The craft is motionless for at least two minutes, then slowly heads north still skimming over the tree line and vanishes behind a hill. My gut feeling is that my daughter and myself have witnessed something extra-ordinary.It was amazingly big and bright. After it vanished I drew a color drawing of the object.;49.9352479087452;-119.405923954372
