Stationary, brilliant colored object seen near Kelowna British Columbia emits ball light;2006-09-16 22:10:00;1.25hrs;Stationary, brilliant colored object seen near Kelowna British Columbia emits ball light Object Noticed in NNW of Kelowna: Sky was void of clouds: The one object observed emitted brilliant, non flashing colors.  It emitted red, white, green, and orange.  Red light was emitted from the top and bottom, in the middle was a greenish band of color.  Orange and white light was seen in and around the center.  The object seemed to be diamond shaped.  It was viewed through fairly high powered binoculars.  The object remained stationary fairly high up in the sky for about 30 minutes after initial spotting.  It then completely disappeared for about 1 minute and then later reappeared in the same spot.  Other stars could be seen in the background while this object disappeared, so I don't believe any cloud obstructed it.  It was a very clear night. The object remained in it's original spot for another 30 or so minutes, during which time a small ball of white light was emitted from it.  This ball of light travelled underneath the main object, in a straight line (left to right) for about 5 seconds and then disappeared instantly.  The main object being observed then disappeared from this spot shortly afterward, and then, reappeared about 5 degrees to the right at a much lower altitude and remained stationary.  The object observed in this second position was observed by myself about 10 seconds later after it disappeared from original position. The object emitted what looked like two balls of light which shot out to the upper left of it.  These balls of light then merged back into the main object being observed.  Approximately 3 minutes later the object disappeared.  There was no further sightings afterward.;49.9352479087452;-119.405923954372
