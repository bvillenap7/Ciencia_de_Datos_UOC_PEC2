There was no noise and the object had no marks of smoke or steam behind us. We stopped the car so we could take a clear look at the object which was at at no more than 800 metres above us. It felt really cool to see that thing with our own eyes...;49.9352479087452;-119.405923954372
HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Perfectly round metallic silver object.;2003-08-03 19:30:00;2 minutes;Perfectly round metallic silver object . I had a telephone call from a wonderful lady who lives in Kelowna, British Columbia. She called as she read article in the Kelowna Capital Newspaper about a fellow who was requesting witnesses to a sighting come forward. She told me she saw something that was pretty peculiar around 8:30 p.m.  She told me it was remarkable to her, so much so that she wanted her neighbors around to discuss what she saw but no one was in the area at the time. she also believes that she may have been the only one who witnessed this object, but of course at this time she hasn't heard from anyone else yet who may have saw it.  The witness went on to say it was a perfectly round metallic silver object moving across the daylight sky. The lady also said it was round apposed to being cylindrical or egg shaped and stressed it was as round as a ball. The object was moving in a easterly direction and she got the impression it was very, very distant.  It moved at a steady pace, it didn't stop, it didn't hover it just kept moving along through the sky until she lost sight of it. She also heard no sound coming from it. No trail or tail was witnessed. She gave a guess at what the size of the object may have been. She took a guess and estimated it may have been the size of a nickel, or at least close after holding out her hand at arms length. She estimates she observed it for approx: 2 minutes before she lost site of it when it went behind the hills.  Thank you very much to the witness for the report.

Object  made a change in direction without  making a curve and did not slow down during this manouver .;2004-12-15 18:00:00;5 seconds;Object  made a change in direction without  making a curve and did not slow down during this manouver . I was sitting in my hot tub , which faces kind of North facing Kelowna looking for satalites when I noticed a disc coming in my direction , it was black and round and about 5ft in diameter . It had no lights , made no sound and was travelling at a speed about 100-150 mph at about 200 feet over head . There is an airport that has planes taking off and that come in my direction and I know what they look like , there are also birds that fly around here and I know what they look like , but neither looked like the object I had seen . The only reason I took a second look at this object was because this object took a turn that was maybe a 30 - 40 degree change in direction without slowing down or missing a beat ( no curve ) . The object seemed to be following hwy 97 going south . ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.  PD));49.9352479087452;-119.405923954372
Viewed a very shinny round object flying  north at 17:17 on 10 June 2007;2007-06-10 19:17:00;2 minutes;Viewed a very shinny round object flying  north at 17:17 on 10 June 2007 11 June 2007  Re: 	Reporting an unusual event which both my wife and I saw over Kelowna, British Columbia at about 7:16 pm on 10 June 2007.  We were watching TV and I looked over my shoulder outside looking due east and saw a very shiny round object moving quite fast at about a 45 degree angle from my view coming from the south and heading north over the city, then moving NE until it disappeared.  Our area has a large lake with mountains surrounding the lake.  The lake is at an altitude of 1130 feet above sea level (according to Google Earth) and our home is about 1710 feet above sea level, or 580 feet above the lake due west of Kelowna and the bridge crossing the lake to the west side.  I cannot get a cloud level, but the mountains in the area are about 5,000 feet above sea level in the area where the object was moving towards and the clouds were well above that level.  I will try to find the bottom of the cloud level should anybody be interested, but have tried and only received answering services from weather, TV, radio phone numbers called.  My wife and I went onto our deck and watched this object for about two minutes as it flew in a northerly direction, stopping many times, flying left, right, up and down in an erratic pattern as it moved north heading over Kelowna and off into the distance, going into the clouds, and coming back out, and finally disappearing into the distance behind the clouds.  My wife watched it through binoculars while I took 4 still pictures and one video.  You can see the object in several of the still shots and in the video, but not too good.  My camera is a Cannon Power Shot SD550.  I’ve drilled down on the computer to see the object closer in the still shots and there appears to be a triangle shape inside the round sphere.  The object was very, very shinny, and the weather conditions was mostly cloud cover, and only a little area where sun came through, however it looked as those the object was a mirror reflecting the sunlight that was not there.  It’s apparent size was smaller than the moon at over head by less than half that size, but larger than any other object we’ve ever seen such as Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, or any such objects.  It appeared to be considerably larger than a small aircraft when it was over Kelowna, something which we are used to seeing in that direction as that was the direction of the airport.   However, it did not go towards the airport, flying finally in a NE direction. In our opinion it was flying many times faster than any aircraft flies through the valley, including commercial jets or private jets, and as I said, in a jerking motion.  There was no noise that we could hear.  We have called the local radio and TV station and will continue to do so, but so far have only received recorded messages.  We have never ever reported things like this, and this is the first one my wife has seen, but not the first one I’ve seen.  I’ve never reported any other such things to anybody.  I am 62 years old, retired, well traveled, having owned many businesses, and I’m not prone to imagine such things.  Regards,  ((names and address deleted)) Place Kelowna, BC  P.S. I will send the images if requested ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with one of the witnesses to this incident, and we found him to be seemingly sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.

I got my girlfriend out on the deck and she to witnessed it until it passed over our heads then suddenly dissappeared without a trace i have seen the ISS pass overhead before and after eliminating an aircraft because of no flashing light thought it must be the ISS. the only problem with that is that the sky is clear no clouds its warm and dry no parcipitation of any kind and no obstructions in the way ie trees or buildings or anything for that matter Its speed was constant and in a very linear plane it came out of the sky on slow decent until it got over our heads them simply vanished into thin air. very odd ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
