Approx size = match head held at arm's length.  Direction of travel: an ARC, approx. NE to SW. No tail. No visible trail left. No sound.  Disappeared over horizon (mountain). Seen by my girlfriend who was looking for a lost cat.  I realize you have had hundreds of fireball reports and this one isn't much but the time and direction of travel might have put it over Seattle that morning.  Hope this helps plot a trajectory.  She reported this to the nearest astronomical observatory (Penticton, B.C.) and was told that others had seen the same. Thanks for the outstanding service you are providing.;49.9352479087452;-119.405923954372
large green/blue ball falling from a cloud into the lake;2005-04-23 21:25:00;5 seconds;large green/blue ball falling from a cloud into the lake We saw a green/blue ball the size of a basketball fall from a low laying cloud, as it fell it burst into smaller balls and then became a big ball again and continued to fall above Okanagan Lake. It was extremely bright, no sound, and fell extremely fast.;49.9352479087452;-119.405923954372
