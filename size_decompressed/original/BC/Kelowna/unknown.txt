We;1991-09-01 11:00:00;approx 1 hour;My husband and I were on a holiday in Kelowna B.C staying on the top floor (5th) at The Queen Anne Hotel in the old section of town. We arrived back at the hotel about 11 o'clock. My husband, binoculars in hand, was at the window looking skyward as he often did. He called me to come and look too. What I saw still stays in my mind though it's been more than ten years ago. A bright light was stationary high up in the sky strobing pale yellowish light, then red, then green then back to yellowish and so on.We watched it for more than half an hour.Another white light came from the east and moved horizontally toward the brighter one.It disappeared as though flying into the brighter one, then a second zoomed toward the larger light and disappeared into it in the same manner. The the brighter object then dimmed it's light and headed straight up very quickly.It stopped briefly straight over where it had been then zoomed off at high speed in am easterly direction. We know how long the sighting lasted because Jay Leno was just coming on (11:30). We were still watching the activity when Conan O'Brien came on one hour later. We reported the sighting to Mufon here in Vancouver and spoke about it at one of their meetings. I also wanted to see whether anyone else had seen this and put an in the Kelowna paper. I received two responses and a phone call from others who had similar experiences though not of this one.One woman married to a forest ranger saw three large triangular craft flying at night. Another man had seen what he called paisley objects on the lake. The radio station there told me that others had seen this kind of thing quite often. I've since heard of an abduction in the Kelowna area involving a former school mate. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));49.9352479087452;-119.405923954372
film footage of a possible craft, and a flashing red light in the sky;2004-02-07 18:00:00;30 seconds;film footage of a possible craft, and a flashing red light in the sky I have on film a craft with flashing red lights.  It floated in on the screen, and we watched it for 15 seconds, before it floated upscreen.  Our friends think it is not a plane (I'm not sure) The camera was on a tripod, so we weren't moving.  I also have a flashing red light in the sky the same place as the craft was seen.;49.9352479087452;-119.405923954372
