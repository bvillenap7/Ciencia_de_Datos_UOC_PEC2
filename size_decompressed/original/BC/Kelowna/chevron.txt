I looked up and noticed what at first appeared to be an airplane, complete with flashing port/starboard lights.  The aircraft was flying too low to be an airplane though, and it was not flying in the direction of our local airport: It was heading NW to SE towards Washington (we live in South Central British Columbia).  This aircraft made no noise at all as if it were simply floating through the air.  It moved slightly faster than an airplane and maintained a straight trajectory across the sky.  There were five lights set in rows one at the front, two mid/rear, and three along the back. All five lights consistently glowed yellow, with the front light flashing red and the rear corner lights flashing red on the port side and green on the starboard side, not quite the same frequency as a regular airplane but mimicking the pattern with a slower flashing frequency.;49.9352479087452;-119.405923954372
