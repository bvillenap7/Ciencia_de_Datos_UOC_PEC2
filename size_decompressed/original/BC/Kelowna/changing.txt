My friend and I were talking on the phone when he mentioned he was watching an orange star outside his front window. I looked out my window and noticed that it was way too bright. All of a sudden it started moving, and looked kind of like a plane. It had at least 3 flashing white lights, and a green/blue light at the back. It also had a dim beam in the back.  I watched with binoculars as it moved slower than a plane going up and down, kind of floating.  I didn't hear any noise, but the beam in the back was very strange. It was 11:00 at night and the airports are closed.  Others should have seen this too.;49.9352479087452;-119.405923954372
Took picture of bright orb and on picture you can see faint outline of a disc shape;2015-06-19 12:15:00;33 minutes;Took picture of bright orb and on picture you can see faint outline of a disc shape I noticed an object in the sky, it was orb shaped and very bright.  It's size was that of a city bus (approximately)  It zipped across the sky at incredible speeds and was hard to visually keep up with . It would hover then for approximately 1-2 minutes then  just vanish and reappear across the sky. I took my cell out and took a picture.  I had my camera on negative as with the sun it was easier to see.  On my camera it was a black ball, just moving across the sky.  BUT in the photo you can clearly see it has a faint disc shaped outline. ** my left hand is made into a fist to block the sun so I could see The object......as it stayed close to the sun***  Altitude around 500ft It was around noon Blue skies.  Just want to know what it was ?!!  Thank you for your time! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));49.9352479087452;-119.405923954372
