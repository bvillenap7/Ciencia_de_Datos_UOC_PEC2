Okanagan Triangular UFO's Fly in Formation;1982-07-15 21:00:00;1 hour;Okanagan Triangular UFO's Fly in Formation I've only told this story of my experience to a few individuals. After visiting your site I thought it might be a good opportunity to share it with others who have had experiences with UFO's.  It was during the summer of 1982. My highschool buddy (we were both 17 at the time) and I were just arriving at his father's home. It was getting pretty late (just after 9:00 pm), but there still was some sunlight in the sky. His father lived in the west side, upper floor of a fourplex. The unit was quite high and you had to take the stairs up to the second level.  While walking up the stairs my friend pointed west and said Look, a ufo! I looked in that direction and could not see anything. There was a large tree next to the home and between us and the ufo. he pointed at the object again and I still could not see it. I asked him to describe the object. He told me it was a large glowing redish/orange ball and it was moving up, then across the sky.  Note that Kelowna is located in a valley which holds a large lake. The main city center is on the east side of the lake. The area that we were located was near the downtown core or only a kilometer east of the lake. My friend indicated that the glowing ball appeared to be over the lake, or at least 1 1/2 km from where we were.  The object disappeared and I remember being so disappointed I didn't get a look at it. Especially because my friend said he had seen it so clearly. From there, we both climbed onto the high roof and began to watch the sky as it darkened.  We layed on the roof which faced West for quite awhile (approx - 1/2 - 45 minutes)seeing nothing. Just before we were to head into the house I saw something that I could barely believe.  High in the sky, there was a formation of faint triangular shaped objects flying across the sky. (There was very light cloud cover, however they were definitely above the clouds.) They gave off a faint white light and were moving from South West to North East. They weren't moving very fast at all however all of a sudden you'd see one of the objects leave the formation at an incredible speed and sweep away. It would take angles at such a high speeds that flying aircraft that I have seen could  never make. (not even fighter jets.)  For the next 15 minutes triangular shaped objects joined or left the formation. I was simple astonished by the ease the objects moved at such speeds. When they rejoined the formation they would swoop in and stop in perfect position.  I regularily asked my friend what he was seeing and he repeated exactly what I had just saw. Once I got up and contacted a local radio station to see if anyone else was witnessing what we were seeing.  Soon the formation moved out of sight. We stayed around for another 1/2 or so. We saw a few more triangular objects moving back and forth through the sky. (Some in formation with each other, say two to four objects.)  After it was all over my friend and I just sat and talked about this experience. We have never seen anything like it since. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We will invite the witness to have his friend submit a report, as well.  Very interesting report, we believe.  PD));49.9352479087452;-119.405923954372

Formation of seven moving lights, curving quite fast through the night sky;1999-09-18 02:00:00;30 seconds;Formation of seven moving lights, curving quite fast through the night sky A friend and I were laying on the beach in the early morning, watching the stars when we saw a very strange set of lights.  There were seven lights in total, and they were flying in a perfect formation, it was a formation similar to a 'V' which ducks fly in, one side of the V had 4 lights, and the other had 3.  The object or objects seemed to be quite high, the lights were about the same intensity as the average star.  I pointed out the lights, and we watched as they flew across the sky at a very fast speed.  I am not good at estimating speeds, but I can tell you that it was at least 3 times faster than an airplane it was very fast.  Also, the craft curved through the air, it did not go straight.  It curved in abuot the middle of the sky, and proceeded to go a different direction, about 45 degrees away.   The formation made no sound which I could hear.  Please inform me if there have been similar reports. -;49.9352479087452;-119.405923954372
