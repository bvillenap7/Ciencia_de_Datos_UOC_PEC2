Space station like object looks like it’s continuously on a loop only seeing one object at a time 10 of them. ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-29 22:30:00;15 minutes;Space station like object looks like it’s continuously on a loop only seeing one object at a time 10 of them seen. BC Canada I was on the phone with my Grandfather who has been an amateur astronomer and veteran of the Royal Canadian Air Force and had watched the Kelowna sky for years . I saw a sequence of lights similar to stars that would fly out into the sky on their own one at a time and then disappear and then another one would come on the exact same line and disappear exactly the same way the other one came but you would only see one star at a time. At that point I showed my grandfather where they were and we watched and saw similar objects high in the sky above where we saw the original ones. It was almost like the space station coming past and disappearing and then another one coming right after it on the same line 10 in a row You could only see one at a time.  Each object continued on their own for about seven or eight seconds and then disappear and then the next one would come after it and go on a perfectly straight symmetrical line of the last object.;49.9352479087452;-119.405923954372
