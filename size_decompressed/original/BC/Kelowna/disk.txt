I observed a disk shaped object hovering silently 500 feet above the treeline on top of Dillworth Mountain in a Southwestern direction. The object had a large red and white ball of light in the center of the disk. The color of the disk appeared black against the night sky. The object produced no sound at all.I did notice that the object turned down the illumination of the red and white ball of light in the center of the disk. It looked like when a dimmer switch is turned down on a light.;49.9352479087452;-119.405923954372

It then huvered in mid air and then dived down to the earths serface ( a moutaion top)And either hovered or landed.  (it was imposible to tell because it was so dark)  After sitting or hovering on the montain top for about 2.5 seconds The Flying Sauser disapeared.  except for an eiriy red glow that remained in the same place that the UFO had disapeared.After about 5 seconds the glow also disapeared.I continued to watch for 10 minutes incase inything else unusual hapened.
