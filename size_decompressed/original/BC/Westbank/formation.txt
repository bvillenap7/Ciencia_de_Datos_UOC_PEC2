I happened to see a streaking object in the sky travelling East.  The sun was hitting it, but it was very low in the sky and moving too fast for a bird or small engine plane. I only saw the object for a few seconds and then it disappeared from view behind a mountain area.  It could have been a shooting star, but as it was still very light out, that seemed implausible.;49.866;-119.7387
