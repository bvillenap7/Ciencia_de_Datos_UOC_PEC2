HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  It flashed as bright as a flash of lightening.;2003-07-31 01:00:00;2 seconds ?;Time:  12:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. (somewhere in-between)  Attn: Brian Vike.  I was forwarded and email with details of your witness stories from Kelowna regarding the events of July 31st.  I also witnessed a strange event that night.  I was in bed, still awake, looking out my bedroom window which faces West.  I was looking at what I thought was star, but it seemed oddly out of place.  It flashed as bright as a flash of lightening.  The brightness and oddity of this flash made me jump out of bed, awakening my wife and asking her if she had just seen what I had.  She was asleep and did not witness what I did.  I went outside to gain a better look but it was gone.  The time of this occurrence, to the best of my knowledge was somewhere between 12:00 and 2:00 am.  Thank you to the witness for the report.
