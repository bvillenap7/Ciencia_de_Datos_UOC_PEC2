Impulse engine contrail.;2001-02-15 13:45:00;2-3 minutes;Impulse engine contrail. I am sorry but I did not see an actual U.F.O. What I saw was an Impulse contrail just below the cloud level. There were two trails which appeared to be no more than 10 to 12 feet apart. They both had the tell-tale impulse shape ie: puff of smoke straight line puff smoke straight line etc. The trail that was to the right had an almost spiral look to it. I observed this for about 10 seconds then turned towards our front door and called my wife out to see the trail. It took her no more than 5 seconds for her to come outside. By the time she got there the contrail had almost completely disipated. I ran to the back of the house and went out the back door to see if I could view the aircraft that made the trail. Where the trail was at the back of the house  seemed to be where it had started. The trail went from East to West. I went out to the front again but there was practicaly nothing left of the trail at that time. My wife and I heard no sounds during this event, nor did we witness any vehicles in the sky around our home.;49.2635571428571;-122.77848
Small white object in daytime sky over Port Coquitlam.;2014-08-08 12:00:00;1 minute;Small white object in daytime sky over Port Coquitlam. At the Coquitlam River today, I saw a small, bright white, object moving slowly eastward across the blue sky.  I watched it for about one minute and then it was obscured by a cloud which was moving west.  Then there were too many trees to find it again.   It was not a plane.  It was too high for me to detect any distinct shape. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));49.2635571428571;-122.77848
