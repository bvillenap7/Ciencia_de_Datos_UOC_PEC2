I live in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia Canada approximately 20 miles east of Vancouver, B.C. on March 31, 1997 in the back yard of my home in a small residential neighbourhood of Port Coquitlam, maybe a few minutes after 9:00 pm on a Monday evening, I too saw this very large boomerang shaped craft.  Shortly before 9:00 pm my father had called me and said that this night was supposed to be the last night that the Hale-Bopp comet would be visible, so that if I haven’t already seen it I’d better get my last look!   Being 5 months pregnant at the time and a little bored I went outside to observe the comet, I was looking up at the sky when from the direction of the Southeast I saw this very large what I could only describe as a boomerang shaped object float over above me.   The craft itself was dark with absolutely no lights on and completely silent.  It looked to be very large, it’s a little difficult to judge its distance but I would say it was only a couple hundred feet above me and it was moving slow but steady.   I remember walking slowly backwards trying not to take my eyes off this thing, watching it for as long as I could keep it in sight walking to the farthest corner of my yard practically climbing up on the fence just so I could get that last look until it disappeared from sight.  The whole encounter only lasted maybe 2 to 3 minutes. It was unlike anything I have ever seen before or since. Listening to the radio program on Coast to Coast on the evening of March 13th 2007 got me excited because until now I thought that maybe I was only one of a few who had witnessed this encounter, when I was describing this craft to friends and family 10 years ago I was describing it then as a boomerang shaped craft.  It was surprising and comforting at the same time to hear stories from people that were so similar to mine. Although I did not see this craft on the evening of  (March 13, 1997) where many others did in Phoenix Arizona, I can undoubtedly say that this boomerang shaped craft was seen March 31, 1997 in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia Canada!;49.2635571428571;-122.77848
