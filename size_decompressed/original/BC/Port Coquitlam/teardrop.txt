Black, teardrop shaped UFO flashing lights in the day sky.  ((anonymous report));2017-11-10 16:09:00;5 minutes;Black, teardrop shaped UFO flashing lights in the day sky. My son and I were looking out the window, as he frequently likes to watch birds and planes. He spotted what looked to be a helicopter.  It was in the distance and blinking at the bottom but in different directions.  I figured it was monitoring traffic.  There was still plenty of sunlight and the light was larger than most helicopters.  You usually see a blinking light on the tail as opposed to on the bottom of the body.   At this point it was odd but not alarming.  I then noticed it was flying in circles while going forward and, when it got closer, lacked the blades or tail of a helicopter.  At 4:09pm I started to video record it on my phone, but the quality was too poor and all you could see was the blinking light, so went to grab my camera from the table, and upon my return, just 5 seconds later, it had disappeared.  It was a teardrop shape, sideways and black but when closer had a reddish/orange lustre in the sunlight.  The sky was blue with some clouds.  I also have very good vision and don't require glasses.
