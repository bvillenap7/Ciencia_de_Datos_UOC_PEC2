HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  A very large green light streak across the sky.;2003-08-30 23:30:00;2 seconds;At approximately 23:30 hours Saturday August 30, 2003. I saw in the eastern sky, looking from Port Coquitlam B.C., a very large green light streak across the sky.It traveled from north to south with a large tail. It moved very fast and appeared to start quite high and was traveling in a downward motion. If you have any info on this I would love to find out what the heck it was....  The green light I saw appeared to be quite high as it seemed to be behind some late evening light cloud cover.  It moved very fast,perhaps about a two second sighting. It also had a very long tail.  I didn't think it was a flare or fireworks because it originated so high in the sky and arced towards the ground.  Unfortunately I was alone at the time and have no verification.  The green ball itself was quite large.  Perhaps it was a flare of some sort, but it did not look or act like any flare I have ever seen.  Thanks again for your quick response  Thank-you.  HBCC UFO: This sounds like it was a meteor.  Thank you to the witness for the report.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.

Large bright light hovering over surrey viewed from port coquitlam.;2007-07-30 21:45:00;30-40 seconds;Large bright light hovering over surrey viewed from port coquitlam. I had just turned off my tv and glanced out my window. The moon was just creeping over near Mt. Baker. I watched it for a minute or so then looked over near surrey across the river. There was a bright shimmering light hovering fairly low. It almost looked like a semi truck in the sky. I stared at it for a few seconds and then ran upstairs to grab my binoculars and about 20 seconds later i got back down to the window and it had vanished.
