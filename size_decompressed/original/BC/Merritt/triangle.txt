I was out for a brief bit of stargazing during a meditation retreat, and while admiring the familiarity of the big dipper I happened to notice a strange object.  Initially I was attracted by a series of reddish flashing/shimmering lights, arranged in 3 groups - forming the corners of a large triangle.  The lights moved from the corners down the edges of the object, then reaccumulated back at the corners.  I watched this object for appx. 2 minutes, and as I watched, it passed in front of several stars, verifying it's solidity between the 3 corners of lights.  It moved quite slowly and consistently from East to West, about 30 degrees above the Northern Horizon.  Before passing behind a stand of trees, 2 large spotlights appeared on the rear end of the object.  The spots moved in large, circular motions before disappearing.  I lost sight of the object after it went behind the stand of trees.  It made no sound that I could hear.  With no reference besides the trees and stars, I'm hesitant to hazard a guess at the size of the object, but my intial feeling is that it was quite large - perhaps 100 on each edge.;50.1098;-120.801
