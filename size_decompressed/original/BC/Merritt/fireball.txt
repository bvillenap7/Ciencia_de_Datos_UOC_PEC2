It stayed there for awhile and then moved away towards the west. As we were travelling in a car our view became blocked for a moment by trees and when we were passed the trees we could not longer see this object. The colour did not change it remained silver but seemed to shimmer as it stayed stationary in the sky for a few moments.  We probably viewed it for 5 - 10 mins.;50.1098;-120.801
