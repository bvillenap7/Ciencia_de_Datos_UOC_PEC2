HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  The witness said the object was a brilliant red in color.;2003-10-01 22:30:00;1 1/2 minutes;The witness said the object was a brilliant red in color. I was given the name and phone number of another witness in the Quesnel area who observed something strange on October 1, 2003. A couple of witnesses who were working the late shift at the Quesnel Wall mart saw something burning across the sky at a very low altitude. The witness said the object was a brilliant red in color and traveled across the sky until he lost sight of it due to the local mountains. The object was heading to the southeast. Both of the witnesses discussed the sighting and figured out what they witnessed was a meteor. One of the men said there were flames coming off from the back end of it. Time observed, approx 1 and a half minutes  Thank you to the witnesses for the report.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  An oblong in shape and traveling at an angle of approx: 30 degrees.;2003-10-03 18:45:00;8 minutes;An oblong in shape and traveling at an angle of approx: 30 degrees. I telephoned the witness in Quesnel, British Columbia today to take a report from the lady as she saw something which baffled her. On Friday, October 3, 2002 at 6:45 p.m. she was standing at her kitchen sink washing some dishes looking outside and admiring a beautiful blue sky. She said all of a sudden something dropped down from out of no where. She described it as being oblong in shape and traveling at an angle of approx: 30 degrees. She told me the front of it was kind of blunt, with a tiny tail behind it which went to a sharp point. She described the color as being white with a glow around it being an off white color. The sighting lasted for 8 minutes in length as she did check the clock on the wall. It traveled from the northwest heading northeast. The witness did open her window in case she might hear something from it, but no sound was heard at all. From her location, and guessing the approx: size, she said it would have been roughly the length of her outstretched arm. The witness did contact the local radio station to see if anyone else might have reported it, but no one had.  HBCC UFO Note: One never knows what some of the objects seen in the areas, so I telephoned CKCQ Radio Quesnel to ask if any reports had come in over unusual sightings in the area. The lady I talked with told me yes. Also the newsroom will be getting back to me tomorrow and doing a short interview as I am requesting folks throughout the listening area to make a report if they have seen anything strange over the last while.  Thank you to the witness.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.
