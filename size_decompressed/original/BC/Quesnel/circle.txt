Two rings of lights rotating .;2000-09-29 21:00:00;1hr +;Two rings of lights rotating . One object, shape unseen. A group of lights circular in shape (5 in the center 20 outside).  Passing from west to east and then east to west. When going west to east it was rotating in a clockwise direction and on returning west was rotating anticlockwise.  Above the lower cloud level it was distorted and out of the cloud it was sharp in deffinition as to the lights.  All lights were white but defused in the clouded area.  Slightly north of my location but on its easterly extent it appeared to be almost over the top of my house. This was observed by myself, my wife and one guest leaving and another arriving.  At first glance I passed it off as the arora borealis, but the rotation and rythmic arc was not consistent with this. I tried to make sence of it but the item appeared to be above cloud level and not below it. I tried to think maybe it was a laser light display, but the number of people that may have that equipment in this town I think would be (0) zero.  Also it apeared to be above the cloud not under the cloud cover. This was observed for 30 minutes continuosly at first, then intermitently there after. Altitude could not be established but it had to be large (over two miles)diameter. I remember from the bible a wheel inside of a wheel and that came to mind. This was on Rosh Hashana accoring to the local radio station but I am not religous.;52.9778;-122.4996

THE OBJECT APPEARED QUITE LARGE EVEN THOUGH IT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT 5 MILES AWAY, IT SEEMED AS IF IT DESCENDED FROM THE SKY ALONG THE TOP OF THE TREE LINES AND THEN POSSIBLY WENT DOWN OVER DRAGON LAKE, I WAS SO SURE I WOULD HEAR A CRASH BUT THERE WAS NOTHING, I COULD HEAR DOGS FROM A KENNEL 2 DOORS DOWN FROM OUR HOME BECOME AGITATED WHEN THE ENTITY WENT DOWN AND OUT OF SIGHT. THE OBJECT MOVED IN VERY STRAIGHT AND DEFINITE LINES, IT DID NOT WANDER AND KEPT MOVING ALONG AT A FAIRLY GOOD PACE. IN MY ALMOST 50 YRS ALIVE I HAVE NEVER WITNESSED ANY PHENOMENA LIKE THIS BEFORE IT LEFT ME WITH A FEELING OF SEEING BEAUTY AND ALSO KNOWING THIS WAS A VERY SPECIAL INTERACTION. I WAS NOT ABLE TO GO TO SLEEP FOR A FEW HOURS AFTER AND YET I FELT FULLY RESTED UPON WAKING THIS MORNING.;52.9778;-122.4996
