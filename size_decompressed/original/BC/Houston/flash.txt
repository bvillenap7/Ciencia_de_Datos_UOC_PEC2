HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Bright white and blue flashes. (Lightening);2003-08-07 23:30:00;1 second;Bright white and blue flashes. (Lightening) Again today I received a local telephone call from a Houston resident who wanted to ask a couple of questions, and to inform me of something unusual that was seen by her, and her two teenagers. Both the Mom and the kids reported seeing a very bright white flash of light, followed by a extremely bright flash of blue light which lit up their property. No object or sound was heard, nothing at all actually other than the bright flashes of light.  I did some quick checking and found out that one punch of lightening was seen at the time these folks witnesses the flashes of light. So this one was solved and glad to be able to figure it out quickly. Seems like to many sightings are going unsolved out this way. So again, lightening was the cause of the white and blue flashes of light. I also guess they wondered about it as no thunder was heard following the flashes of light.  Thank you to the witnesses for the report.   Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.
