HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Large blue fireball steaks across the sky.;2003-10-22 20:54:00;3 to 4 seconds;Large blue fireball steaks across the sky. I had another call tonight from a fellow who reported seeing a very large bright blue meteor/fireball shoot straight across the sky from inside his home. It was heading from the east towards the west. There was a very long trail behind it. After he gave me the report I put my boots and coat on and went outside. I looked in the direction he told me where the blue ball of light was seen. Sure enough, still in a clear night's sky a large black contrail could be seen very clearly running across the sky from the east to the west exactly where he said the object was.  I called a friend who was living a good distance to the west of me to find out if he may have saw it, but he was inside at the time.  Thank you to the witness for the report.
