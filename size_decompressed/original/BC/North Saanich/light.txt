I live on Vancouver Island, BC, and witnessed an unusual phenomenon at around 06:49 in the sky this morning...  A bright pulsating/flashing light flying fast and low over Saanich Inlet.  At first I thought it was a small airplane in the distance  we live near the airport and a military helicopter base), but it wasn't making any noise.  Then I thought it was a drone....but the light seemed too big, and the speed at which it travelled was very fast.  It came from the South end of Saanich Inlet, and was headed over towards Cowichan Bay.  The object passed by me so fast, that I couldn't get my video up and running in time.  I know it wasn't just me hallucinating after all this COVID-19 isolation or an issue with my eyes, because even the flock of around 50 Stellar Jays which were on our property got startled.  I called the airport, as I know they have cameras set up aroud the inlet.  Havenâ€™t heard back yet.;48.7;-123.45
