HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Object and it reminded her of a laser light.;2003-08-26 23:05:00;2 1/2 min.;I received a telephone call from a Kimberley resident at 11:30 p.m. and she said she was visiting family at their townsite which is at the northern end of Kimberley, B.C., by the Cominco Mine area and she said there were a couple of them standing outside and a family member happened to notice a jet airliner going over head from east to west. The witness told me what her family member did see was certainly a jet. All of a sudden the witness saw what she thought was a shooting star just to the north of the jet but a lot higher up. She says it started out like a shooting star but then there was a flash of white light and then it happened again approx: 20 seconds later and another flash. They both stood wondering if this may have been another jet as this one was going in a northwesterly direction. But as the witness watched she mentioned that the intervals weren't the same as a jet airliner. (meaning the flashing of the jets lights). It then disappeared and then in another 20 to 30 seconds there was another flash of light.  The witness says this is where it gets a bit odd and figured it wasn't another jet that she was aware of. Thinking maybe it was something the military was flying overhead. She saw a flash in front of the object and it reminded her of a laser light. She also said you could see the light zapping a good distance in front of the object. It again disappeared and in another 50 seconds or so later there was another flash of light.  Thank you to the witness for the report.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.
