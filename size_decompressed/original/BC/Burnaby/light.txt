Several star-like lights travelling across sky with one that sped up to avoid collision into another.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-27 23:00:00;one hour;Several star-like lights travelling across sky with one that sped up to avoid collision into another. Saw many star-like lights travelling across the sky in the mostly the same direction from northwest to southeast and disappearing in the same area of the sky (likely due to the shadow casted by the Earth at that particular region of the sky). The anomaly was when we saw one of these star-like lights coming from a different direction (south to north) and it was approaching another light coming from the northwest.  They looked as though they were about to collide and then suddenly, the light coming from the northwest sped up as if it was trying to avoid a collision.;49.2483045584045;-122.976296296296
