THIS AREA IS NEAR THE NORMAL FLIGHT PATH FOR INCOMING COMMERCIAL AIRLINES COMING IN TO VANC.INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, SO WE SEE A LOT OF AIRCRAFT. THE AIRLINER I SAW ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING HAD A COMPANION HOVERING ABOVE IT. I NOTICED IT BECAUSE THE SUN WAS REFLECTING OFF IT LIKE A MIRROR. IT WAS A SMALL (COMPARED TO THE JET)SHINY SILVER BALL THAT STARTED OUT RIGHT BEHIND THE JET AND THEN MOVED DIRECTLY ABOVE THE JET. I WAS IN SUCH SHOCK I PUT DOWN MY BINOCULARS BECAUSE I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES.SECONDS LATER I PUT MY BINOCS BACK UP AND UNFORTUNATELY LOST SIGHT OF THE OBJECT. this whole incident only lasted a minute or two, but it was very clear to me that i witnessed something very odd. we see many incoming jets of various size and shapes but never have i seen a free floating silver ball like the one i saw buzzing that jet. it appeared to me that anyone on that jet would not have seen anything because of the way the ball was following close behind and then accelerated to zip up and over the top. it was very small (perhaps 3-4 ft across) and i'm sure i would not have even noticed it if the sun had not reflected off it. when i went in to work and told my co-workers i saw a ufo, they all scoffed at me, so i haven't told too many people. it definetly was an unidentified flying object. when i heard the art bell interview of feb8 i was so impressed by peter davenports sincerity, integrity  and dedication i decided to make this belated report. i hope it is of some benefit to you.;49.2483045584045;-122.976296296296
