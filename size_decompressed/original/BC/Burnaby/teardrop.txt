It was a cool clear nigh in January.My girlfriend and I were just about to go in our hot tub,when I looked up and said,look a falling star!Then it changed direction.It was comming strait at us.I said  look it looks like its comming strait for us.Thinking it would crash somewhere near!As it got very close I started to get scared!Then all af a sudden it was just there! 40 feet directly above us!!!Just hovering,barely even making any noise,just a very faint humming,just enough so that I knew it was real!Then a super highly intence beam of light came on.Shining straight up!I thought that was odd.Then the light started to rotate around the craft until it was shinning directly on us!The light was so bright that I could see the dust particals in the air,and it was january!!Just after a snow fall!I looked down in the tub and I could see through the bubbles like they werent even there,and the tub was on!!The heater was stuck on and the temp was 110,so we couldnt get in right away,so i was standing in the tub,my girlfriend was outside of the tub just ready to get in.All i could say was you see this right!!over and over.The light was so bright that it almost seemed to freeze time.I know that sounds wierd but its the only way i can describe it.The craft was a dark color almost grey and a sort of dimond shape.Then I thought to go and get the video cam,it was just inside the house!But it was like they knew what I was thinking,because the light when off,rotated back to the top of the craft.Then as fast as it came,it streaked away!Gone leaving us in shock!I've kept this story to myself until I saw your site.I think they were investigating the heat source of above normal,when they got there,what do you know,two naked specamens , scaned us and split before we coud even move!;49.2483045584045;-122.976296296296
