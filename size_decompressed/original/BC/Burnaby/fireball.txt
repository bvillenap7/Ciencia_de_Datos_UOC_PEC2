Suspected meteorite - glowing debris descending very fast and steep;2003-11-07 17:11:00;3 seconds;Suspected meteorite - glowing debris descending very fast and steep Pretty sure this was a meteorite but anyway... driving home west on Marine Way near Byrne road at 17:11h, Nov 7 I observed (just for a moment) a streak of glowing debris in the NW sky, low to the horizon. It was coming in at a high rate of speed and at a very steep angle relative to the horizon. It looked as if it could made land fall not too far away. ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the date of the alleged sighting was in the year 2003.  We have altered the date above to 2003.  PD));49.2483045584045;-122.976296296296
