Never seen befor.. A Solid Black Craft.....;1995-03-09 15:00:00;45 min;Never seen befor.. A Solid Black Craft..... On the 9th of March, 1995, around 3 PM, I was sitting in the kitchen of my home drinking coffee and savouring the impressive view of the north shore mountains that border the city of Vancouver. Suddenly my attention was drawn to a triangular formation of three dark objects slowly approaching from a valley in the distance. Taking somewhere between 5 - 10 minutes to approach my location. As they did, two of the objects moved away to the east along the mountain range, the third coming to a halt almost directly in front of where I had now relocated myself on the verandah. I rememberd a camera in the house that had a telephoto lens so I ran in and got it and proceeded to note further details through the lens. In the clear blue sky the black craft had 2 distinct bumps on the upper surface, and though apparently stationary, was clearly rotating.It was so black no shadows on the craft at all. Not only was I awestruck , but also scared, though not quite sure why. At this point the UFO appeared to be the size of a dollar coin (Loony) held at arm's length. At no time during the lengthy observation did the craft reflect light from the brilliant sunshine. It was later assumed that as the object was visually just below the height of the distant snowline, then its altitude could have been around 3000 feet or less. No accompanying sound was heard. Suddenly realizing additional witnesses were close by, I called out to them and I was joined by 5 others. This group watched the craft through binoculars. It wasn't until the object began to move away to the west did I realize that the camera was not empty and had only 1 picture to take left on it!!  Trying to time a profile shot befor it got too far ..being unaware that all three UFOs were within the view finder I snapped a shot of it and when I got the photo back I could see all 3 in the shot. The total observation of this sighting was approximately 45 minutes..;49.2483045584045;-122.976296296296

Suddenly realizing additional witnesses were close by, I called out to them.  This group watched the craft through binoculars.  It wasn't until the object began to move away to the west did I realize that I hadn't taken any photos!  This I very quickly did, being unaware that all three UFOs were within the view finder. The total observation of this sighting was approximately 45 minutes, this was established through later questioning of broadcast program times.  A local weather check determined that the local wind speed was 8 km/ in this event a picture was taken and went national news on TV. My mother was on a visit.  We went up the gondola to Grouse Mountain. I was telling her the story of what I had seen.  The person operating the gondola interrupted my conversation.  And he had said that he had seen the same three craft pass within feet of the cable wire holding the gondola up.  He was so frightened he said that he ducked down thinking these craft we're going to hit the wire. Eighteen year old M and friend W were returning from shopping at Metro Town in Burnaby at 3 PM, April 5th, 1995, when they spotted what appeared to be the same three black UFOs in the sky ahead, holding a vertical formation.  The objects hovered, appearing to rotate from right to left.  No noise was detected during the 5-7 minutes observation period.  Visually, they were smaller than a dime held at arm's length. As they continued to walk slowly back home, still facing north, the craft slowly moved upwards into the fairly low cloud cover and subsequently out of sight. In this event, no pictures were taken.   Further investigation revealed that the immediate area contains a small lake and a nearby cemetery.;49.2483045584045;-122.976296296296
Just before sunset a huge green/yellow streak of light shot accross the sky (north-east) so fast and disappeared without a trace left.;2001-01-22 17:12:00;3 seconds;Just before sunset a huge green/yellow streak of light shot accross the sky (north-east) so fast and disappeared without a trace left. Sky was a blue/gray just before sunset(not dark yet)...A quite large streak of light almost like a shooting star but it was not a shooting star at all, fired accross the sky way too fast to be a plane or anything else like a jet...etc and too slow to be a shooting star.It started off blue in the front with green tail but turned green front and yellow/green tail. I think it was heading north-east to east direction. It streaked and then just disappeared into nothing, no trace of anything in the sky. There was no planes or anything else in the sky that caught my attention. The object itself was very clear except it had a blurry tint around the whole thing. It seemed like when it shot off it started a little slower than when it took off at the end. ((NUFORC Note:  Four major, very bright fireballs were reported to an astronomer in Saskatoon, SK, in Canada for this date for between 0759 hrs., 22JA01, and 0010 hrs., 23JA01.

Bunch of lights interconnected.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-04-22 21:57:00;30 seconds;Bunch of lights interconnected. 10 seemingly connected lights flew high above.  It was a line and the lights were moving perfectly together.  It appeared northwest and flew straight, not very fast, for approximately 30 seconds, then faded in the southeast direction.  It looked like a very slow shooting star.  I was frtunate enough to get it clearly on video.;49.2483045584045;-122.976296296296
