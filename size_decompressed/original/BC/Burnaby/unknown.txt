THE f irst object was half a hand at arms length.The object could have been a plane but the light pattern seemed not common.IT was travelling about 150mph.It sounded like piston engine but could have been other object.AS I SAY I would not report this but for the fact of the light pattern of all white lights. THE object appeared to be 10,000 ft. approx. It was partially foggy at the time. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We do not understand how many objects the witness describes here, but it appears to be two separate objects.  We observe that the descriptions are not inconsistent with typical aircraft.

Large explosion leaves city confused;2006-03-22 11:05:00;2sec;Large explosion leaves city confused My girlfriend and I heard a loud and deep explosion unlike anything you would ever hear on any given night. I thought it must have been a large gas explosion, but according to news reports it wasnt the case.  Heres the only scoop I got on it so far, maybe it was a UFO?   News clipping:   Nah. It couldn't have been a meteorite. Could it? Mar, 23 2006 - 2:20 AM   BURNABY/CKNW(AM980) - A loud explosion in Burnaby late last night has authorities scratching their heads.   About 11:05 the blast rattled windows and awakened neighbours near the Chaffey Burke Elementary School on Abbey Avenue.  Police responded with officers and a dog but came up empty handed. All they could find was a small hole in the ground.  No damage has been reported and there were no injuries. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));49.2483045584045;-122.976296296296
