((Starlink satellites??));2020-03-15 21:30:00;20-30;This evening my husband took our dogs out side in our back yard facing north towards the mountains . He looked up straight ahead and saw what appeared to be a satellite moving in the sky ( which he has seen many times ) . But what caught his attention was behind that satellite there was another satellite looking object .  They kept coming and coming one after the other it was  basically a streak of lights but nonstop coming from west to east with a moderate distant between then .  And all disappearing at the same place in the sky , the teapot formation ( not orions belt ) but on the opposite side of the sky which is north east from where we are.;49.2483045584045;-122.976296296296
