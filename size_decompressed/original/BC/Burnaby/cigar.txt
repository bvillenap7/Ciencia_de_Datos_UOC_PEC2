I was outside my high school taking pictures with a digital camera for the school web site. At the time I did not notice the craft, but when I downloaded the pictures onto my computer I saw the craft in one of them.;49.2483045584045;-122.976296296296

But the light was way too high up to be a plane.  Stared at it for about 5 minutes.  It was traveling SE slowly.  I ran into the house to grab my binoculars.  Called my girlfriend out and said there's something in the sky that shouldn't be there.  Looking through the binoculars....it was an upright cigar shaped craft.  Silver/whiteish in colour.  There was either a white light flashing on the top tip but it flashed in no particular rythm.   After about 10 minutes of watching it...it seemed to almost change shape.  Then disappeared.  We both looked at each other and said  I got nothing.   No explanation as to what it could be or even try to guess.;49.2483045584045;-122.976296296296
