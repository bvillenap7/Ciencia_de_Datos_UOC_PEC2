the truth is out there , we've all seen it;1979-11-27 20:45:00;4-5 sec;The truth is out there , we've all seen it I was riding my bicycle home from the store and had to stop to switch hands to carry the bag, as i did this for some reason i looked up and seen 6 or 7 round disks flying in group formation about 200 ft above me.  There was no sound or lights and they were a greyish colour. There were a few stationary  clouds which made them stand out so much.  They were traveling in a sw direction approximately 200-300 mph.  As they passed they seemed to be skipping over each other.   After that whenever i let the dog out i would sit on my back porch looking at the night sky thinking about what i had seen until the night of 5/22 of the following year when i observed three of the same craft flying in the same direction in a triangular formation,  One in front two behind.  As for my credentials i have been an investigator of strange phenomena for the past 33yrs and the  influence behind a hit tv show.
