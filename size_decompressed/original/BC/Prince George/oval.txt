Hovering oval shope reflecting forest below it.;2004-04-12 09:30:00;unknown;Hovering oval shope reflecting forest below it. Although this is a year after the fact.   As I remember, I was driving up foothills when I noticed something odd to my left. I did not stop, but I kept looking and noticed an oval shaped object hovering over a small valley at eye level.  The odd part about it was that the object was reflecting the trees from below and the sky above. It was a perfect mirror image.  The object was about the size of a medium sized car.  I also remember reading in the Prince George Citizen about crop circles in Moores meadow park a day or two prior to my sighting. (NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.
