A bright triangular shaped fast moving object that has been seen more than once by myself and others in my household.;2000-11-21 18:30:00;10 minutes;A bright triangular shaped fast moving object that has been seen more than once by myself and others in my household. At approx. 8:30pm I was standing on my steps having a cigarette and looking up at the stars as it was a beautiful clear night.  I noticed a particularly bright star in the horizon and was looking at it with awe, it started moving in a erratic pattern. At first I thought it was a falling star or a dying one.  I continued watching it and it started moving toward me I thought I was seeing things so I closed my eyes for a few seconds, when I opened them I couldn't believe what I was seeing it was a triangular shaped flying device with a very bright light that was sending sparks of light through it, it freaked me out so I ran into the house.  I thought I was just seeing things at first and that my imagination was running away with me but my daughter has also seen the object and described it to me without knowing what my experience was.;53.8666711711713;-122.86412027027
UFO SIGHTING OVER 1.5 HOURS OF WATCHING THIS IN THE CLEAR SKY, CHANGING COLOUR!;2012-08-21 11:30:00;1.5 hours;UFO SIGHTING OVER 1.5 HOURS OF WATCHING THIS IN THE CLEAR SKY, CHANGING COLOUR! My wife and I were sitting in the hot tub I had gone out just before this and saw what I thought was an airplane. I then came out and my wife asked if I saw what was in the sky it had moved but not much. I thought at first we were maybe looking at a helicopter as it was hovering low in the atmosphere. We kept watching and it was changing colour, red, and blue but mainly was going brighter to lower light. It looked like it was having issues as it was moving erratically but was slowly going higher in the sky, we were amazed and called some friends and they saw it from there home and came over to our place where we watched with binoculars it was amazing! When it was closer it looked like it was triangle but looked more like a saucer with the glasses, we watched this for over 1.5 hours as it was getting further away into space and had done a few circles. When it was closer it looked like another object or light went near to it the sky was clear and we watched th! is object fly deeper into the atmosphere and away from earth. My wife and I will never forget this event and know it was a special moment that we will share with others for the rest of our time!;53.8666711711713;-122.86412027027
