Today I took a small walk down to the corner store by my place. On this day for some reason I decided to take my camera with me. Here's a photo of the UFO I saw. http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i162/Izy_101/P1010308.jpg   If you look in the top left corner you can see something small reflecting light off it also if you look in the direction of where the object is flying you can see a circular sphere in front of it.;53.8666711711713;-122.86412027027
