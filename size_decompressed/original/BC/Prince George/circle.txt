Me and a friend were driving to pick up his parents at a near by restaurant. There were four red spheres about one meter in diameter hovering over the back yard of a home on the street we were driving on.  They looked like they were big lights on a pole, but when we slowed down to look at them they rose higher into the air and went into a formation with one about a 100 feet above the ground with the other three just over the tree tops.  We followed them as they went out to the boulevard and began flying lower and in a seemingly systematic pattern over the neighbourhood.  Another vehicle stopped on the street and was observing the red balls of light as well.  They continued slowly flying over the neighbourhood for about 15 or 20 minutes until they went up and over a hill and out of sight.  My friend who was with me at the time seemed strange afterwords and did not wish to discuss what we had seen.  Also he deleted the pictures he had taken of the objects from his cell phone camera a few minutes after he took them.  He would not explain why he did this.;53.8666711711713;-122.86412027027
