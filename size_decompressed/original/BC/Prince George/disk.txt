I had a shift from 4:00 to 8:00, and was driving out to my rural home after work one night. There are two railroad tracks along the extent of the road, and I had already passed two trains. This was unusual for this stretch of track, and I was thinking it was wierd. On the long straight stretch, I noticed another train. I couldn't tell if it was moving or not. I wanted to find out so I'd know if I should speed up to beat it to the crossing. So as I approached the end car of the train, I slowed down a bit. The train wasn't moving, and I was just about to speed up again when a  kind of disc came from the bushes beside the track. It looked a little less than two feet, and was white-ish. It looked kind of like condensed fog or something solid but opaque It was kind of glowing, but it didn't really give off any light.It zoomed out of the bushes towards the road, veered towards my minivan, and flew right over top. It scared me enough to make me scream out loud, then I sped the hell out of there! My knees were all shaky and I was really freaked out. I wasn't on drugs or anything, and I'm not some wierdo who made this up. I'm embarassed to tell people what I saw, cause they'll think i'm crazy or something! What's interesting, though, is that a lot of other people in my community have mentioned seeing things, like wierd lights in the bushes and funny noises. There's a lot of stories about this area...I'd never really believed any of them till now. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));53.8666711711713;-122.86412027027
