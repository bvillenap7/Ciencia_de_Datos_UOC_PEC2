2 main ships in glow followed by 2 sets of formations travelling together in fuzzy white glow;2020-04-15 22:00:00;1 hour;2 main ships in glow followed by 2 sets of formations travelling together in fuzzy white glow Girl friend and I layed out on front deck to watch the meteor shower. Both sitting facing East, NE. From the South, 2 objects traveled together at a very high rate of speed (south to north). If I could close an eye and put object between fingers at arms length, fingers about 2-3 inches part. Both object moved together in what seemed to be a fuzzy, glowing plasma bubble around both to form one big bubble. We noticed slight colour of green, and yellow. Possible visible temperature of ion propulsion system, or some warp drive system. The travelled exreamly fast, maybe 5 seconds from horizon to horizon. The seemed to fly straight but also a sort of jerky motion noticeable over the distance it travelled. After it had passed we had no time to really have it sink in when from the same direction came what appeared to be a squadron of 8-10 pointy ships travelling in the same kind of glowing plasma bubble around all of them, followed about 10 min later by even another! larger grouping of pointy ships, same fuzzy plasma bubble, same direction and, same incredible speed with the same smooth but jerky motion. Everything appeared white in colours with the odd shade of green and yellow on the 2 larger ships. About a half hour later, the 2 larger ships, travelling from North to South now, same incredible speed and again together in the same fuzzy ion bubble. That was not all for the evening..... we saw 2 streams of the new satellite streams, going different directions and other normal satellite activity. One of the satellite in a line got incredibly, bright...diffrent from a normal sun reflection. We did get to see 2 meteors from the meteor shower zip by but they too.
