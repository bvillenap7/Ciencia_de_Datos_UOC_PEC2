Pin point of light in night sky comes at me or expands into larger ball of light  then retreats and disappears.;2007-01-20 21:00:00;5 seconds;Pin point of light in night sky comes at me or expands into larger ball of light  then retreats and disappears. I was riding the chair lift at night on the back side of Grouse Mountain, by myself. It is completely unlit on that chair lift. I was looking into the starry sky when I saw a pin point of light, like a tiny star, suddenly expand into a bright ball of light as though it were coming straight at me, but not streaking. It appeared in size about half the area of the full moon. It remained like that for about 5 seconds, then retreated back to a pin point of light, and then disappeared entirely.. I wasted quite a bit of time trying to find out from this and that agency what it could have been, but to no avail. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Brilliant radiating white flash over Vancouver horizon lights up entire sky 4 times;2014-03-28 00:30:00;15 minutes;Brilliant radiating white flash over Vancouver horizon lights up entire sky 4 times.   As it stands I still am in the dark as to what this could have been, but what happened was this I was walking home across a local park, when there was a flash of light, which lit up the whole park and everything I could see, but made no sound.  There were large industrial lights at this park so I simply chalked it up to a flickering bulb.  As I walked past the light that I thought it would have been about a minute later the flash happened again, but I still thought little of it, admittedly it was a little strange but I kept walking none the less. Another minute later I was walking up my street when the flash happened again, this time I was sure there was no regular cause to this, for coming from  past the northern mountains of where I was, a brilliant flash lighting up not only the entire sky, but the whole of my surroundings as well,  but made no soundâ€¦  I rushed Up the street to get a better view of the place where the flash had come from, which is Over top Mt Seymour From where I was standing In Deep Cove North Vancouver.  As I stood there staring the brilliant white light flashed again, radiating outward like a sonic boom, but without any sound.  Each occurrence was about 2 minutes apart and the whole sequence of events (4 flashes) lasted for 10 minutes. I am writing this 2 days later, hoping for some conclusive explanations?;49.339526993865;-123.037974846626
