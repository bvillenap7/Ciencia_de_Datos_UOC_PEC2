Triangle shape with three lights in each corner, silent and fast;2004-04-22 21:50:00;10 seconds;Triangle shape with three lights in each corner, silent and fast My friends and I had just stepped out on my balcony to admire the clear sky, when my friend said what's that? It was a triangle shaped craft with three faint, yellow or white lights in each corner of the triangle. It was completely silent and moved very quickly across the sky, from the east to the west(roughly).This was way too low, faint, silent and fast to be anything like a plane. None of us had seen anything like it, and the speed and silence are what is really freaking us out. ((NUFORC Note:  Case forwarded to UFOBC.  PD));49.339526993865;-123.037974846626

I was with my mom when I looked up to see 3 stars I was looking at were  gone. Around them was three stars In a purfect distance. In fact,nearbye I  beleive I had seen more. I could swear I saw lines inbetween the,well,stars.  I didn't count the date 'cause I didn't know I could report it like this. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We wonder whether the witness might have observed the three satellites often seen flying in unwavering formation, which are thought to be part of the U. S. Navy NOSS satellite system.

1 triangle shaped grey object flew in landing gear first with very large landing gear on either wing.;2008-01-20 11:00:00;3 minutes;1 triangle shaped grey object flew in landing gear first with very large landing gear on either wing.  Moving on a small axis in complex maneuvers.  Low to the ground, close to me, maybe 500 feet away and one storey above the water.  No noise, no smoke trail, and then it twirled sideways out of my view behind the building I was in.  No lights were seen although it was a clear day in the middle of the day.;49.339526993865;-123.037974846626
