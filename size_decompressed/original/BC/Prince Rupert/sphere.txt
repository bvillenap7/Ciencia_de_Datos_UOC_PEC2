glowing sphere, red and orange-ish at low level;2003-02-19 03:00:00;approx: 30 sec.;glowing sphere, red and orange-ish at low level I was in Prince Rupert and one night I was watching late night movie on T.V. It was about three in the morning, the sky was clear and the apartment was Three Stories, we were on the top floor. Anyway My couch was next to the window that I had opened. I just happened to look out at the sky and I saw a glowing sphere that was floating in the sky about maybe Six stories high above the trees that were behind the building. I jumped off the couch and leaned out the window and it was silent. It didn't make a sound and it was moving very slowly. All I can say is that It was a throbbing, glowing ball that was red and orange-ish. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I was moving so slow  that I had time to jump into some pants and shoes and run outside but when I got outside it moved over the tree line heading  in a North East direction. Well anyways the next day when I was telling my story, some said that I was full of it and others say that I was a witness to a very rare event of  Ball Lighting there was one person that caught footage of it years ago.  I was Emailing you to ask you if anyone Else might have saw such a thing that might be labeled a U.F.O.
