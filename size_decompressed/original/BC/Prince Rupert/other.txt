At 12:12 p.m I looked outside to see what my dog was barking at, I took four Photo's and 2 1/2 min. video tape of an odd shaped craft, it was black in colour with an intence white light on the top right, the object just vanished towards the North.East. without making a sound.;54.3189;-130.3248
Temporary big red flashing star.;2016-10-09 20:37:00;2 minutes;temporary big red Flashing star Too far out to know for sure but I was walking down the road in my small town, we always see activity in the sky here I even have some on my instagram.  But this really caught my attention.  A star just under the big dipper that I don't remember being there caught my eye as it was flashing orange and dark red.   I stopped to watch it and noticed another white star that would usually be thought as a satellite go from (not good with my bearings) what would be the handle of the big dipper toward the spoon end but underneath the huge red flashing thing.  Then just as soon as it was there it all disappeared :(  So much for that..  Wish I could watch the sky more.;54.3189;-130.3248
