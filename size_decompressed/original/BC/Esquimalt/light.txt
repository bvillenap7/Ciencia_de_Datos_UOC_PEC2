Strange light in Vancouver island sky.;2014-08-12 18:00:00;5-7 minutes;Strange light in Vancouver island sky I walked a buddy out to his car.  As I looked up, I saw a bright ,white , spot of light ,moving across the sky.I noticed it made no noise,and at six p.m.  It's pretty quiet here. It seemed to be moving to slow  to be a plane ,there were no running lights and it wasn't shooting a beam of light like a spotlight on a helicopter.  I pointed it out to my friend and we watched it for about a minute together ,agreed it was strange ,and parted ways.  I continued to observe the light for about another five minutes ,until it just disappeared into the clouds, in a north north Easterly,direction. This is the third time I've seen this same?object in the last year .;48.4518;-123.4206
