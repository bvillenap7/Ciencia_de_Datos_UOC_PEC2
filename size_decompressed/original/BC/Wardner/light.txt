HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Light as being colored and round in shape.;2003-07-26 00:50:00;5 seconds;A nice lady called me to report that her and her husband witnessed a really strange colored light fall from the sky. The witnesses were sitting in their living room watching television with their curtains pulled wide open. She said she did not see the light for very long due to it's speed it was traveling. But she did yell to her husband and said, look, look, look ! She mentioned the light was approx: the size of her thumb nail as it flew over top a steeple on the building and over top a local mountain. She reports the light as being colored and round in shape. The light was witnessed for approx: 5 seconds falling through the night sky on a slight angle. No sound was heard due to them being in their home, plus HBCC UFO estimates the light was at a great distance away from the witnesses. No aircraft were visible around the area at the time of the sighting. No tail was seen traveling behind the light. The light was moving in an northeasterly direction.  HBCC UFO thinks this may have been a meteor that the folks witnessed. Thank you to the witnesses for their report.
