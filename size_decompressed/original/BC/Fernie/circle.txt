I saw almost like a flash of light on the other side of a tree.  It was orange.. like a dark orange.  The trees obscured the light.  It got brighter as I thought this.  Then I moved my head to see it better and the light started to fade and eventually disappeared.  I went back to bed thinking that was very strange.   I've seen unidentified flying objects before and this was one of those times.;49.5;-115.067
