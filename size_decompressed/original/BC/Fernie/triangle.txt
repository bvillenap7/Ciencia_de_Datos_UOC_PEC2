CANADA: 3 faint points of light resembling stars and forming a triangle;2002-08-13 03:00:00;40seconds;CANADA: 3 faint points of light resembling stars and forming a triangle 3 faint points of light resembling stars and forming a triangle drifing across the night sky as I watched a meteor shower in progress. No noise, no sudden movements. Maybe a satelite? If it was a satelite all the way in orbit, each point would be very far apart from eachother id imagine. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a sighting of what are thought to be three satellites launched by the U. S. Navy under the N.O.S.S. program.  We have received many reports of them.  PD));49.5;-115.067
