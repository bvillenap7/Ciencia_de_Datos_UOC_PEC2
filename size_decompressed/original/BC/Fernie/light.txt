Appeared very distant like a star, but the brightness was changing frequently in intesity, which is what drew my attention to it (couldn't sleep 2AM and it was very bright).  I watched it and noticed it was moving around sporadically and very quickly.  It was seen in the NW sky from the town of Fernie above Mount Fernie.  It faded out and dissapeared once.  then susequently re-appeared and vanished completely after about 10 minutes.  (Gone by 02:10);49.5;-115.067
