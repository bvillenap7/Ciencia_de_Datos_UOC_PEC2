((Starlink satellites??));2020-02-19 19:00:00;4 minutes;I noticed what I thought was a sattlelight in the sky to the west of Orion but it disappeared before I could point it out to my BF.  Then another appeared on the same trajectory it too disappeared soon after it crossed below Orion.  A third appeared and disappeared in the same spot.  We saw a total of 10 the last 3 changed trajectory upwards closer to the Orion consultation.  The times were different between 10 and 20 seconds between each light.;49.0855;-117.8121
