No sound.  Blinking/beaming had no sequence went in every direction, sometimes slow then fast...seemed to be metallic, but was so far away could not see more than the lights.   Never saw anything like it.  Did not wake hubby up or get better camera, I was just so mesmerized.  It was over N.W. Kelowna.  I'll never look at the night sky the same way.   I think my dog just sensed I was afraid at first glance n stayed close to me, it was so far up in the air I just sat down n watched it, thinking I hope someone else is seeing this ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
