Nighttime UFO sightings West Kelowna.;2014-08-26 21:45:00;10 seconds;Nighttime UFO sightings West Kelowna This is my second sighting.  First sighting occurred approximately 3 months ago, same location, with a witness.  Object appeared to be flat, triangular.  It almost appeared transparent, but we could see very faint round lights along the margin of the object, giving hint to its shape.  Absolutely no sound came from it.  It travelled rather slow, approximately 100 feet up from where we were standing.  First sighting, it lasted maybe 5 seconds second sighting last night approximateely 10 seconds.   Last night I was able to follow its direction for that length of time, but then lost visual contact or disappeared.  During the first sighting it was travelling south to north last night's sighting it was travelling east to west, and directly over the town of West Kelowna (area of SuperStore grocery store), both times.;49.8625479452055;-119.585428767123
