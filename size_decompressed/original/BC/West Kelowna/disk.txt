I was sitting outside having a cigarette under my gazebo.  It was 10:58 pm and my mother and sister were inside.  There were a few clouds in the sky, but it was dark.   I saw something fly past the clouds.  It was very bright, unlike anything else in the sky.  It was shaped basically like the typical UFO you see on television like a flying saucer.  I was stunned for a second and then it came back again.  It looked like it almost had little circles on the edges of the saucer. It was so bright, almost blue-ish.   It disappeared after that and I ran inside. ((NUFORC Note:  Student report.  PD));49.8625479452055;-119.585428767123
