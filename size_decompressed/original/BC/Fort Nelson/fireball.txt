My friend and I  were on our way to take a college course at the College of New Caledonya in B.C. We left Alaska at 7:00am, so that by the time of the incident, it was between 10:30pm and 11:30pm. It was very slightly overcast as we were driving the highway, I could make out the outline of the mountains against the night sky. It was a mountainous area, forested. My friend was asleep as I drove. We were approximately 80 miles northwest of Ft.Nelson, on the Alaska Highway, when off to my right, hovering over a valley,between the road and the mountains, approximately a quarter mile away, I seen, what looked like, three round aluminated balls of fire hovering over the valley. The round lights looked very hot and veried in color as they pulsated and hovered over the valley. The biggest one was approximately 60ft. in diameter and was bright white, and was hovering, what looked to be approximately 150ft., over the trees. The second ball of light, what looked to be half the size of the biggest one, was directly underneath, maybe fifty feet lower. This second ball of light was bright yellowish white. Directly underneath the second ball, at an equal distance was a third round ball, again, one half the size of the one above it. This smaller round ball of light looked very reddish in color. All three round lights were pulsating very fast. It was like looking at an arc welder. I woke my friend up and we both observed this phenomena for approximately 60 seconds. I stepped on the gas in an attempt to get closer, for I could see that the road went to the right up ahead in a closer direction towards the lights. As we went around the bend, we could the lights through the trees, when they just vanished. Within ten minutes, we seen, what looked to be, a white light, 60ft long,20 ft.in diameter, round on each end, moving very slowly, against the back drop of a mountain. I stopped the vehicle and shut off the lights to observe this light. It moved very slowly, horizontally and started to pick up speed. It left a trail behind it that got duller the further back the trail went. This lighting phenomena lasted approximately twenty seconds and what looked to move about three miles, then all of a sudden, took off extremely fast and left no trail after itself, all we seen was the light traveling at an instant high speed acceleration that looked to travel the distance of maybe 10 miles, in less then two seconds.

He had never seen the report before this. Just thought I'd pass it along to verify the report. ((name deleted)) Hi ((name deleted))! I remember that incident just as plain as it happened yesterday. It is hard to beleive that was over 10 years ago.  Where has all the time gone?  I still don't know what it could have been.  It is thought provoking that it made its appreance in a wild and remote part of British Colombia.  Almost as if it didn't want to be seen.  Perhaps we will never know just what it was?  And again, maybe we will.  Anyway, it is something we can tell our grand kid's about.        ((paragraph deleted)) ((END CORRESPONDENCE));58.8181;-122.5484

We saw what looked like 3 round large balls of light levetating in the air.The biggest one was on top,it looked like it was very hot in color, a very bright white, the next one was under that one and it looked like the color of fire yellow, then the next one was under that one, it looked like it was fire red/yellow. All three were equally spaced apart what looked like about 30 to 60 feet apart. The biggest one looked to be about 50 to 60 feet in diameter, the next one down was about 35 to 25 feet in diameter, and the small one was the closest one to the ground, it looked to be about 15 to 20 feet in diameter and was about 60 feet off the ground. They all just hung in the air with no sound, but very bright.As I drove faster to get closer to them, I got about 200 ft from them and they all just disappeared. As we drove further, we seen what looked like a very large white oval light ahead of us maybe 1/4 mile. I then stoped the car, turned off the car lights, and shut off the car as not to disturb whatever it was.My friend and I watched it for about 5 min. then it started to move very slow but started to go faster and started to pickup speed. Then it took off real fast and left a long trail behind that looked like the same shape and it stayed white for some time. It looked like what your hand would look like as you passed it in front of you fast.We drove to Watson Lake and reported it to the R.C.M.P. as a UFO sighting. My friend is a Pentecostal Minister for 20 years, he is about 54 years old, and I am 52 years old myself now. All the round balls were glowing like a electric welder, a pulsating-light.
