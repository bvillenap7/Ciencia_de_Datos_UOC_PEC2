UFO SIGHTING 7 PM OCTOBER 27, 2013 VANCOUVER ISLAND  At approximately 7pm Sunday night Oct 27 I walked out on my west-facing deck to check out the evening just before it got dark.  Had been working at my computer until then. As I looked over the Alberni Inlet, I noticed a large, slow moving light in the Western sky, somewhat to the South.  Approximately opposite the APD mill.   It was too big and not bright enough to be a planet or star, too slow moving to be a normal aircraft.  It slowly moved towards the tree line, looked like it was just above the trees.  I realized it was exceptionally unusual and I should get my camera.  I ran in and grabbed my camera and came out and shot about half a dozen pictures.  None are that clear, but by zooming in on the computer I could see a perfectly round object with raised markings on the bottom:  ridges and indentations going in a circle………….almost like a “copyright” seal. I phoned a friend who lived at the lake, somewhere on the other side of that mountain.   While I was telling her to look in the Eastern sky, back towards town, she said: “ I see it through the trees, a light in the sky”.    I told her to try and get a photo but haven’t managed to connect with her yet to see if she did.  I have several photos I am willing to submit…………will see if there is an upload option on the official form.;49.2403;-124.8026
