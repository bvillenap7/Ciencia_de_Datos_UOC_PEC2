Transforming cloud;2009-07-28 09:30:00;45 min;Transforming cloud We were standing on my folks deck, it faces south toward America. It had just turned dark and the full moon was bright. An oval cloud ring formed with a dark middle just to the side of the moon. It did not move from this spot the whole time we observed it, while other sparse clouds, were moving eatsward. This cloud? started to change in formation, it split into 2 perfectly shaped ovals, making a figure 8 with dark centers. The moon now passed behind this cloud? The moon was blocked out, no longer could we see the moon through the cloud? As the moon continued passed this cloud?, the moon was very bright again. This cloud? was barely big enough to block out the moon from our perspective, it wasn't huge by any imagination. We watched the cloud evolve into another formation, looked like an open waffle iron, not moving from where this cloud originated from.....we all remarked at how weird this was. After 45 minutes or so, the cloud? dissipated into the sky and no longer exsisted. Not your normal UFO story, but what else could this have been?
