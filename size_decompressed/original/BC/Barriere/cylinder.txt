HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:   saw a huge cylinder shaped craft flying very quickly.;2003-09-03 23:10:00;approx: 5 seconds;I saw a huge cylinder shaped craft flying very quickly. I was told about a sighting report which comes out of Barriere, British Columbia. There was one witness to this event which took place on September 3, 2003 at approx: 11:10 p.m. A lady had been outside and was making her way back into their home when she happened to glance up and saw a huge cylinder shaped craft flying very quickly, she claims it was really low. This witness told me that even with it being dark out, you couldn't miss seeing it. It was larger than any aircraft that she knew of, looking at it length wise. She said there were a large number of bright white lights on it. Her thoughts were maybe these were windows and they were running down the full length of the object. There were no wings noticed on the craft and when I asked more questions, she said it actually reminded her of a long tube. No sound was heard and the sighting lasted for approx: 5 seconds.  At the time of the sighting her boyfriend was inside their home and he reported to his girlfriend that their cat went nuts when the object passed by. Of course he had not known about the craft until his girlfriend told him, and he mentioned about the cat at that time.  Thank you to the witness for the report.
