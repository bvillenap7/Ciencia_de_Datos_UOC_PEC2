I was operating a bulldozer at a coal mine on the night shift.I was working at the north end of the mine, which at the time was not being used, clearing rock from a coal seam.It was a moonless night and about five minutes into my 4am lunch break I noticed some odd lights in the sky. I grabbed my coffee and stood out on the deck of the machine to see better. There were two round lights connected together by an oval shaped light.These lights were much bigger than any star that was in the background so I assumed that it was fairly close or really big. The two round lights were what I would call irradecent.It was hard to nail down a specific color as it constantly seemed to faintly change color. The oval light was more like a pale white light, like from a dim flourecent light. I had shut off the engine of the machine and all was very quiet.After about five minutes of watching I observed the pale oval light that seperated the other two lights begin to get brighter. The lights then moved a good distance, angled upward in a straight line, stopped, moved down in a straight line,at an angle of about 100 degrees or so to the first line, and about the same distance and stopped again.It then took off again at an angle that intersected, roughly, with the original position so that a large triangle pattern was formed by it's movements.The lights were heading, in a northeast direction, into the horizon and faded into the distance within ten seconds or less.Also, like I said, all was quiet around me and not a sound was heard.I've never seen anything like that before or since and this is the first time telling this story in this fashion.
