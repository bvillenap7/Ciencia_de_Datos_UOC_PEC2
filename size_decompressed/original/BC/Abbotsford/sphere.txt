There was three of us including myself, we were about to go sledding, but waiting in my driveway for someone else. it was beautiful night with just a few clouds in the sky, my friend pointed out that it probably would not snow that night since there was not to many clouds, so I then looked up and saw a sphere shaped shiny brown object about 500ft above us I was yelling for the others to look up one other besides myself saw it but the thrid did not it then went into a cloud. it was going about 2x as fast as a plane but it was closer then a plane would be so maybe a round the same speed.;49.049909178744;-122.299892270531
