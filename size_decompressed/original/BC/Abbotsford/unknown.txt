Three lights in formation soon followed by single light;2004-08-15 03:30:00;30 minutes;Three lights in formation soon followed by single light While Lying in a field me and three friends saw 3 lights traveling across the sky that at first apeared to be satelights but curiosly stayed in perfect formation as if they where all part of one solid object.  We continued to check on them from time to time as they traveled across the sky then just as the reached the opposite horizon from where they had begun, a single light appeared where we had first seen the three. It travelled at high speeds, about 3 times the speed of the three, and headed straight towards the three, and over the horizon after them ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  First three lights may have been the three satellites that are frequently reported to our Center, PD));49.049909178744;-122.299892270531
