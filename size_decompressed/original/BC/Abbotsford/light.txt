White bright round light - hovering for a few minutes then disappearing.;2000-08-30 14:00:00;2 minutes;White bright round light - hovering for a few minutes then disappearing. On or about August 30, 2000 my boyfriend and I were driving westbound just south of Abbotsford Airport, Abbotsford, British Columbia.  On the horizon, in front of us and just to the right of the airport runway we noticed a bright light in the sky.  My boyfriend and I thought that a large plane was coming in for a landing.  This bright light which looked to be about two to three miles away remained in the same position in the sky.  The light did not get closer or move away.  It just hovered there.  I drove faster trying to get closer to this object in the sky and then it disappeared.  In both of our minds, this was not a plane, or a balloon, or a satelite, or a helicopter.  The light was brighter than the landing lights of a jet or helicopter. In both of our minds this was certainly an unidentified object.;49.049909178744;-122.299892270531

A plane would have had to turn around I was outside on our balcany watching the sunset. We live high up so we can see the lights of vancouver, and then I see a light sort of looked like a star really far to the north-east of Vancouver, and I see this light and I figured it was a plane, but it didint seem to be moving. When you look at a plane you see a blinking light, but this didint have any blinking lights. I knew it was facing me by the way the lights were but suddenly it goes through clouds that are directly behind it. A plane would have had to circle around so within one second I can see it again after it came out of the cloud and it was going faster then any plane ive ever seen it was hard to say what shape it was but if I had to guess I would say Teardrop. It was dark colored;49.049909178744;-122.299892270531
