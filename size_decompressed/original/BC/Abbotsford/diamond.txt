Unexplained object in the fraser valley british columbia.;2013-03-22 12:00:00;unknown;unexplained object in the fraser valley british columbia. I did not observe the object until I entered my photographs into my computer and was previewing my photos.  The object appears in only one photo, it is what I perceive to be diamond shaped and quite bright. at the time that I took this photo I was photographing a storm cell to my north and so this object stands out against the black clouds.  This is the second time in two weeks that I have captured a strange object in this area, the other time was March 8 2013 but those objects were photographed on a sunny day and I sent you 6 photographs of that event along with a report.;49.049909178744;-122.299892270531
