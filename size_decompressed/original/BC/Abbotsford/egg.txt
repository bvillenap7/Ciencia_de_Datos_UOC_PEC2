Two egg shaped, Lighted, super fast moving, vibrating objects traviling north one behind the other.;2006-07-17 23:30:00;2 min.;Two egg shaped, Lighted, super fast moving, vibrating objects traviling north one behind the other. I was sitting in the catrium (Chicken wire inclosure I built for my cats) having a smoke and I saw a huge bright flash. Almost like someone turning on the Sun in the middle of the night. It was so fast I would have missed it if I was blinking. when I looked North West-ish I saw two figgures, egg shaped, almost vibrating and moving in a northern direction. I know the differance between a star, plane, commet, and planet and these were none of those. I couldn't sleep all night. I stayed outside hoping to see them again. And I'll be out tonight to.
