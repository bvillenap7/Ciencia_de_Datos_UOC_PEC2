Brilliant Orange Fireball traveling across sky in Abbotsford, BC;2011-01-02 20:30:00;2 mins;Brilliant Orange Fireball traveling across sky in Abbotsford, BC On January 2nd, 2011 at approximately 8:30pm Pacific Standard time, I heard my husband yelling for me several times to come out on our back deck  (I was in the bathroom at the time and thought there was an emergency or something, he doesn’t usually yell like that). What we both witnessed was an extremely bright orange fireball traveling slowly across the sky, from North to South. I managed to see it too for about 45 seconds, before it arced and was obscured by buildings.  It was a brilliant orange fire colour and I asked my husband if he thought it was a small plane that had caught fire. He stated no as there appeared to be no tail, it was too round. The height of it could have been about 2,000 feet but hard to tell.  It definitely wasn’t a meteor, or space debris entering the earth's atmosphere, which we've seen many times before.  It was very silent and moving slowly as though with purpose.;49.049909178744;-122.299892270531
