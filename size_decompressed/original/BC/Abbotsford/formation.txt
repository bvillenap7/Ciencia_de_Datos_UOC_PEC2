I was driving at work doing a normal perimeter inspection at night  with no one around or near, I saw lights in the sky to the south so I stopped the truck thinking it might be a reflection in the window.   I opened the door and stood up on the door sill gazing up at them, I grabbed my cell phone to try and take a video but it wouldn’t focus on them they didn’t seem too far away maybe about  two miles,  there were six orange orb shaped lights that were moving slowly changing formation but all still flying to the west, starting to separate farther apart.”   No I wasn’t on drugs”,  I felt crazy but I radioed my partner who was inside, to go and take a look outside to the south and tell me if he saw any lights in the sky.  I had saw them fly for a few miles for about three minutes then they disappeared.  But by the time my partner went out they were gone.  I came in to the office and still stunned at what I saw and obviously feeling crazy in front of my partner I thought to check our video footage on our super camera that pans the field, and sure enough it picked them up great.  But not as far as I could see them for, the camera only pans so far and high, and the lights seem smaller on the camera than from my view, I was about half way between camera location and the lights as you can see my truck lights in the footage.;49.049909178744;-122.299892270531
