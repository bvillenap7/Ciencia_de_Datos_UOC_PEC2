Circular UFO with blue color along edge.  ((anonymous report));2001-12-11 20:45:00;1 minute;Circular UFO with blue color along edge. While changing some xmas bulbs on my garage roofline, I was looking towards the roof and a light caught my eye. I looked straight up and saw a neon blue circle dart across the sky. South bound. I am on a flight path in North Delta and looked over to see some airliners coming in towards Vancouver Airport. They fly west bound. The light I saw looked like a neon blue ring type object. It was moving so much faster than any airplane. Almost looking like a shooting star except not falling , but streaking across the sky. It made no noise and i could not judge how high it was but looked above the flight path. It was close enough for me to make it out as a ring formation and the color was spectacular. I would be surprised if the incoming planes did not see it .... it was clear out and the path it was on crossed the flight path.
