On Mother's day I was leaving my Aunt's house to go back to Vancouver, while I was waiting by the car (for my grandmother to leave my aunt's house) with my dad I noticed 3 bright stars, one larger than the other two, forming a perfect triangle.  I recognized it off the bat, I had seen the same formation a couple nights before off my balcony in Downtown vancouver at approx 11pm. (although that time, there was 2 triangles, one was much larger and felt it was very low, hovering above the building in front of me) It was weird, I felt some sort of prescence that made me look up. The triangle was a deep-gray black, slightly different black than the rest of the night sky, and the stars (or lights) were all whitish hue, 2 the same size with one brighter at the tip. (for both triangles)   As we were still waiting for may grandmother to arrive I kept staring at it and it seems to float a bit to the side, but passed it off as my eyes playing tricks on me. (it was really light out at that hour, still blueish sky) I thought it was weird to see the lights when there was no stars out yet. My aunt escorted my grandma to the car, I pointed out the stars to them and my aunt looked stunned and uncomfortable, she even mentioned how she thought it was odd and that it seemed to be moving.  We drove away, and I kept watching from the back of the car. When I arrived Downtown it was darker, those lights were no where to be seen.;49.0862511627907;-123.026852713178
2 crafts, triangle shape, with green and red lights on edges and flickering lights in between/along bottom.;2012-11-28 06:15:00;15 seconds;2 crafts, triangle shape, with green and red lights on edges and flickering lights in between/along bottom. On drive to work, saw 2 identical craft although not flying close together.  The one closer to me was triangle shape, had lights on edges with flickering lights in between or what I imagine would be the bottom of the craft.   Only saw for about 15 seconds as I was driving.;49.0862511627907;-123.026852713178
