huge green hatbox-shaped cloud hanging without movement or dissipation in sky;1976-04-26 03:30:00;10 minutes;huge green hatbox-shaped cloud hanging without movement or dissipation in sky I don't know if this falls into your field of study, but i'm sending it along in case it is of interest.  I was 16 and headed home from school across the back field when i noticed something wierd up in the sky. I had a good view of everything from the school to the North Shore Mountains and have always had good eyesight, but couldn't really fathom what was hanging there... maybe people will laugh but it was a perfectly hatbox-shaped, very minty green cloud, about a mile away and hovering over the city about 2 miles up.  It was also huge, covering about 2 miles with it's shadow with a height of about a mile. The thing looked like some kind of oval hatbox, hanging up there in the sky. And it didn't move. It had a puffy surface texture that clearly showed an effect of wind, sort of like a knife moving icing, for want of a better description... but the cloud itself looked solid and didn't move, although a couple of smaller and more normal-looking clouds in the sky were moving along at quite a fast clip. I remember remarking to myself that it was interesting that the wind made no dent in the shape, all the edges were sharp and regular. The whole thing showed an almost perfect symmetry. And the colour! I'd never seen a cloud that was mint GREEN before!  I stood in the middle of the field watching this thing for about 10 minutes. Nothing happened, so i went home.  I felt at the time that this might have been the result of an industrial gas accident but there was nothing on the news. Even if it had been, i wonder why such an emission would have taken on this shape and not dissipated in the wind. Anyone have any explanations?  Never saw anything like it before or since.
