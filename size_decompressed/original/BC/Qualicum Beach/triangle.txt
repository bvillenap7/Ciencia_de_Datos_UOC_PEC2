Good day, Last night I saw a UFO  here in Qualicum Beach, BC. It was about 10:30 pm and my daughter and I where in our outside hot tub when all of a sudden we saw the most amazing and longest shooting star we have ever seen, after seeing this we started talking about UFO’s and my many experiences in Mexico before.  After a few minutes she went indoors and I remained in the hot tub, just lying down looking at the beautiful night sky full of stars… it was then that I saw a huge triangular shape, almost transparent, see- through UFO,  it had small triangles within, it must have been  at least 100 meters of the ground and it was slow and steady, I saw it fly above me and then just flew away…  I felt mesmerized and amazed,  I felt a little bit of fear , but the fear quickly went away, and after a few more minutes I came back indoors and told my wife and daughter about the incident. I just wanted to leave some kind of report of my experience last night, thank you for taking the time to read this. I have had many more experiences with UFO’s in Mexico, but this was my first time here in Canada after 9 years living here. Now, I know they’re here , for some reason… this is very interesting! Best regards.
