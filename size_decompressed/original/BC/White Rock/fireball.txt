A fireball, no noise, appeared then faded into nowhere three times, twice over the same path.;2012-08-10 23:10:00;3 x 20-30 sec./each;A fireball, no noise, appeared then faded into nowhere three times, twice over the same path. Friday night, August 10, 2012, my husband and I drove over to the Semiahmoo Spit and parked our car head first on the west side of the spit so that our vehicle was facing Boundary Bay and White Rock, B.C..  It was completely dark with a clear sky.  We live in Blaine Washington, so we often go there in the evening/night to sit and look out and talk.  All of the sudden, coming from the North and just to the East side of White Rock, something appeared in the sky, and it looked like an airplane on fire.  We sat and watched not knowing what was going on, as the object moved slowly, and with no sound, to stop for a second or two just to the right of us, and about 1,000 - 5,000 feet above.  I can’t be certain of the height.  It then disappeared after a very brief fading of a split second or so.  We continued to sit in amazement, not sure what we had just seen, when, it came back.  I came about 3 or 4 minutes later, on the same path, again, looking like an object on! fire.  We didn’t hear anything, or see any shape or other lights on it.   We sat there for another 10 min. or so, and saw it come back, but this time it was quite a bit further North of us and quite a bit East of White Rock.  It disappeared again, and we finally left and drove back home.  I was happy to find this website with similar sittings!;49.0278;-122.803
Burning objects falling from the sky.;2013-10-08 11:20:00;10 minutes;Burning objects falling from the sky. Just saw 3-4 fireballs east of White Rock.  Not sure how far it was but I could see smoke trails from the fireballs.  It seemed like a very strongly burning object falling from the sky.  Then I noticed another object (maybe an airplane) going back and forth close to the fireball and dropping off another burning object.  This happened 3-4 times.
