I was drawn to a star which was in a westernly direction from where I was. I thought at first it was an aeroplane or helicopter, but watching it for a few minutes it didn't move, so I thought it must be a star even though it was foggy. I looked through the binoculars and could see it was winking red,white and green lights. I was interested because I have seen a star overhead at times like this before, but thought it had changed it's position. As I watched, it turned into a solid red circle, after which it straightened out to a worm shape with some white along the side, also turning into an oblong shape. I must have watched for about twenty minutes while it was changing mostly from a circle to a straight line. A second one came from behind some trees and passed out of sight. I know it was the same but cannot remember now how I knew as I never wrote down any details at the time. It was still there when I left the window but had gone maybe half an hour or so later when I looked again. The next morning I phoned the R.C.M.P. to see if anyone else had reported anything about it, and not knowing who else to contact as I was unaware of this website until now.;49.0278;-122.803
