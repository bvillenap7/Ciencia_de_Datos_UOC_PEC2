This object appeared to be moving rapidly in the sky but not like any shooting star, it was moving in zigzags and pacing back and forth. It was as bright as a star as I saw it moving, and it was avoiding them, because it never went front of one where we were. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));51.2998;-121.3996
