HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  A silver, round shaped object;2003-07-17 20:00:00;approx: 4 seconds;A witness contacted me today July 20, 2003 to explain what he saw on July 17, 2003. It was 8:00 p.m., clear skies (daylight) and he saw a silver, round shaped object traveling at an extremely high rate of speed coming from the west heading east. The sighting took approx: 4 seconds before it disappeared from his line of sight. He also mentioned that it took him totally by surprise to see something move so quickly. No sound was heard due to the distance from the object. He said it was no darn aircraft we have, as to the speed the object was traveling. I asked if he might be able to give some details to what the object looked like, but he said it happened so fast he could not get a proper look at it.  Thank you to the witness for his report.
