fireball in sky pacific northwest july 29 02;2002-07-29 22:30:00;20seconds;fireball in sky pacific northwest july 29 02 on the evening of july 29th while fishing on the mighty skeena river as the day turned to night the largest ball of flame i've ever seen came out of the north sky.i watched as it dropped out of the sky and disappeared out of sight behind the large trees across the river.the next day i asked a fellow from the next tent over from me,he had also seen the fireball and at his vantage point he could see thru several of the trees and suggested he has seen a flash at the end of his view,possible  indicating impact.i'm not suggestting this was a space ship but am interested if anyone else witnessed this event.my guess is a large meteor at this time.
