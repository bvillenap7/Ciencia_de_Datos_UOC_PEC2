HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Unusual craft followed by a white ball of light.;2003-08-27 21:20:00;approx: 4 seconds;Unusual craft followed by a white ball of light. A fellow called tonight to report seeing a unusual craft followed by a white ball of light heading from the southwest to the northeast. This took place roughly 3 kilometers away from Thronhill, Terrace British Columbia. The sighting lasted for approx: 4 seconds before it disappeared. No description was given as to what the craft looked like as it all took place very quickly, but he did say in that short period of time he could certainly see some type of structure  and was followed by a bright white ball of light.  Thank you to the witness for the report.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.

it may have been a jet;2006-02-27 04:30:00;30 seconds;It may have been a jet. It came from the SE sky very fast for being so far away. It had red and white blinking lights ( I saw 4-5 distinct lights). It travelled from east to west for about 10-15 seconds and then, what surprised me was the 180 degree turn, within 2 seconds and in another ten -15 seconds disappeared. It may have been a jet, because there was a sound like a jet, but Canada doesnt have a jet like that.;54.5154;-128.6042
