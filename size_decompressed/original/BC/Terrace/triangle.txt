One slow moving light at first, triangular, appears to be just a bright light. After seeing the second one irratic movements, swiftly moving short distances in the sky very quickly, stayed in southwestern sky.After about twenty minutes of the movement the red and blue lights came, extremely bright, the red light was bright when it hit my eyes, at this point they came closer so they were the brightest lights in the sky tried to make contact at this point by shinning our flashlight at the moving lights, they seemed to ignore us,about another twenty minutes later the two lights just stopped we starred for about another ten minutes and a bright light, about the size of a dime or a penny in the sky flashed twice, one blue, the other red. The two lights wich stopped were now moving again for about ten minutes they stayed in the same area of they sky, then they went to more of a red and blue for five minutes, the lights suddenly went out.Contact me, i have pictures in devolpment ((e-address deleted)) is my addy.;54.5154;-128.6042
