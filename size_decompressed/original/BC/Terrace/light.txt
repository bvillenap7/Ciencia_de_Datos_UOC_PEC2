HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:   I was wondering if there was any UFO sightings in MR'03 in the Terrace area.;2003-03-23 02:30:00;very fast;I live in Terrace B.C., and just out of curiosity I was wondering if there was any UFO sightings in March, 2003 in the Terrace area. I was sitting outside of my Kenny street home at approx: 2-3 in the morning having a smoke. When I looked up at the stars I noticed a large bright light. I didn't thing anything of it until it went underneath the clouds. That is when I freaked out and ran inside. Please e-mail me ASAP with or without info about this. Thanx.  HBCC UFO Note: A little more information on the sighting below.  Thank you so much for e-mailing me back. When I was watching the light I did not notice any strange movements. It just went horizontally across the sky. I have no idea how high it was, like I said it went underneath the clouds. It was the same height the whole time. But I know that planes don't fly underneath the clouds, especially at 2-3 in the morning. I didn't watch it for long. When I saw it I got scared and ran inside. Sorry if this is not much help. If I can help in any other way please e-mail me at . (Witness information deleted).

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Light grew to double the size on the moon.;2003-05-09 22:35:00;8 seconds;Light grew to double the size on the moon. I received a telephone call from a Terrace, B.C. resident using the toll free hotline, he wanted to report a strange sighting he witnessed on May 9, 2003. It was a cloud-ness night and this witness was walking from the north end of his property towards his home and was looking at the night sky, viewing the northeastern part of the sky he noticed a strange, small, out of place light. As the witness watched the light, it began to grow in size, and grew in brightness by the second. Within 5 to 6 seconds the light went from being the approx: size and brightness of a star to approx: double the size of the moon. The light, or object was traveling  at a very high altitude heading toward the southwest and at this point straight over top of him, still at a high altitude. After the light/object had disappeared from the fellows sight, another strange light showed up some 5 minutes later.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Object/Light exploded/or flashed brightly.;2003-07-17 01:15:00;5 mins.;Object/Light exploded/or flashed brightly. A witness contacted me today July 20, 2003 to explain what he saw on July 17, 2003. It was 8:00 p.m., clear skies (daylight) and he saw a silver, round shaped object traveling at an extremely high rate of speed coming from the west heading east. The sighting took approx: 4 seconds before it disappeared from his line of sight. He also mentioned that it took him totally by surprise to see something move so quickly. No sound was heard due to the distance from the object. He said it was no darn aircraft we have, as to the speed the object was traveling. I asked if he might be able to give some details to what the object looked like, but he said it happened so fast he could not get a proper look at it.  Thank you to the witness for his report.    A witness reported seeing a strange object sitting stationary over the mountains to the north. He was traveling on Highway #16, just crossing the bridge over the Kalum River. He pulled over to the side of the highway to get a better look at it. He said the object moved from side to side, and up and down ever so slightly. (HBCC UFO Note: At this point of the conversation I was thinking what the gentleman had witnessed was nothing more that a star, until he gave me the rest of the story).  He watched the object stay in a stationary position for approx: 5 minutes before it exploded/or flashed brightly. He said at this point it stared to move downwards  and ended up losing sight of it when it dropped behind one of the local mountains. He described the color of it as being neon green in color, with a whiteish aura surrounding the object. He also noted seeing a neon green and blue twinkling lights at the bottom of the object. He also said he believed there were a number of white flashing lights that were more to the center of the object. The witness said he did make a report to the authorities.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  High altitude object of white-grayish color.;2003-07-18 23:15:00;50 seconds plus;High altitude object of white-grayish color. Brian,  Last night at 11:15 p.m. I was talking to my neighbor, (name deleted by HBCC UFO), on his property. There was only a strip of sky exposed due to tree crown cover in place on his property. When I looked up I did see one high altitude object of white-grayish color traveling from the southwest to the northeast. I would say at least 10 Km up. The sky was clear and no cloud was around. I told (name deleted by HBCC UFO), who had his own UFO experiences The second object was following the visible one across the sky in a short distance..but remained invisible throughout the whole time means 50+ seconds.  Interestingly enough, the area of sky visible was very limited due to the tree crowns and it almost seems to me that  they  choose this direction to be seen like the one I saw months ago which came closer within a small break in the tree cover on my property to the east. This flight path is actually situated roughly 40 Km's to the southwest. The two objects were followed by a third one which flew in the same direction 2 minutes later.  Thank you to the witness for their report. HBCC UFO Note: Possible satellites.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.

It got bright over Thornhill before going less bright going your direction. I believe it was no plane, meteorite or satellite as it did look really strange. The sky was  +- 30 % overcast. No sound was heard coming from the light/object. Color change was like so many times before..just kind of going bright and going more dim afterwards. No stops, no hovering. Nothing strange regarding behavior and I would say it was +- 10-30 m in diameter.  Thank you to the witness for the report.
