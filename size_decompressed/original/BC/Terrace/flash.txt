HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  A flash, then I watched a white colored light.;2003-08-26 21:08:00;approx: 5 seconds;A flash, then I watched a white colored light. Hi Brian,  I just came inside with (name deleted by HBCC UFO) after sitting down for 90 minutes on the pile of wood I cut today. At 9:08 p.m. I witnessed a flash of light coming from on easterly direction. A few minutes later I watched a white colored light move across the sky and roughly 3-4 km's away and it did peak over the trees and disappeared.  Thank you to the witness for the report.
