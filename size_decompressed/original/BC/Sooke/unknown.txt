I was sitting in my backyard having a smoke at about 0:15 on the 15th of May 2006. I looked into the the sky, south over the ocean, and saw what appeared to be a really bright star, brighter than anything else in the sky. As I watched, it was moving slowly, in a south eastern direction. It moved for about 3 minutes, then stopped. It has been hovering there for about 40 minutes now. At about 0:45 The object faded out to a pin-prick, and the brightened again. It remained unchanged till 01:10, when it again faded to a pin-prick, after about a minute it returned to it's normal brightness. At 01:15 it again faded, but this time it went out completely. It returned to it's normal brightness again, but almost immedialtely.After this happened, it seemed to slide out of position ever so slightly. At first I thought I was seeing things because it never seemed to move, just slide over then back in an odd way that I can't really describe. It did this for about ten minutes, then remained stationary. It is now 01:45. I have noticed no changes, it is still the brightest thing in the sky, (aside from the Moon), and I must go to sleep. I'm sure if this is a U.F.O, or some space program thing, but I'm awfully curious.;48.3717;-123.7248
