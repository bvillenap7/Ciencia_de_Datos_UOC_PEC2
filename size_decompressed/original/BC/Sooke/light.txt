Bright blue orb.;2012-09-01 21:00:00;10 seconds;Bright blue orb. Illuminated blue orb seen floating past my window above the tree line.  Not exactly sure of the date, but it was a very bright small blue orb -  I jumped up and went to the window and watched it traverse the sky appearing to be maybe 100 - 200 ft in the air.  It floated briskly horizontally across the sky.  This was definitely not a reflection, it was a self illuminated vibrant blue orb - not really a light because it was so defined.   It has left a strong impression on me because it was very strange. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));48.3717;-123.7248
