Bright green sphere with long trailing tracer making 90 deg turns moving at a very high rate of speed across the night sky;2016-07-16 23:30:00;15 seconds;Bright green sphere with long trailing tracer making 90 deg turns moving at a very high rate of speed across the night sky I had just picked up my daughter from work from her evening shift.  Pulled into the driveway and got out of the car.  My daughter disappeared into the house and the clarity of the evening sky and the moon caught my attention.  A bright green sphere with a long green tail trailing behind with very defined edges of colour.  I noticed a flash of light in the sky.  It dropped straight down at a 90 deg angle for about a sec to another 90 deg turn to the North.  At a very high rate of speed darted from the South due north  directly into the centre of the big dipper and disappeared.  Only one was seen. Was higher elevation than a plane but lower than a satellite or shooting star.  The trailing green light behind was about half the distance it travelled. as soon as the sphere disappeared the green tail followed and disappeared into the very same spot about a second later.  Total time seen was about 10 sec. I live in a rural area.  It was a clear evening.  The moon was roughly 240 deg in the sky.  Cloud cover was negligible.;48.3717;-123.7248
Slow moving circle of light.;2017-05-26 23:00:00;3 minutes;Slow moving circle of light. Ella Beach just outside Sooke.  We notice a slow moving object heading east about 1000 feet in the air.  I would estimate it was about 60 feet in size.  It was just as bright as a star and made no noise.  I caught some of it on video but the battery in my camera died.  I viewed the object for well over 2 minutes it was moving so slow. Friday, June 2nd, 2017, same location.  This time much higher in the air and moving much faster. It was moving in a southern direction toward Washington state.  This one appeared to phase out of reality and disappeared.  7 witnesses.;48.3717;-123.7248
