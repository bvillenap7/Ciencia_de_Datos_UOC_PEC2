I was driving and proximately 50 km/h through my town at dusk when I noticed 3 black cylindrical shaped objects about the size of at small house each at approximately 300 ft in altitude equally spaced in a triangular formation about 100' from each other and traveling slightly slower than me.   As soon as I could I pulled over and jumped out of my car.  I happen to have high-powered astronomy green laser on me.  I would never point that at any airplane, but I was completely confident that these objects were of such a strange nature!  that I could point my laser them in an attempt to make contact.  I could not even get a reflection, the moment my laser touched one of the objects it disappeared at which point a second witness saw me and a 1km visible green laser beam shining up into the sky in the direction of the 2 black remaining objects.  there was no sound to these objects or lights. I proceeded to point my visible green laser at the second object and it disappeared.  Then the Third, and there was nothing to look at.   I waited there for a while to see if they would reappear and they did not. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));48.3717;-123.7248
