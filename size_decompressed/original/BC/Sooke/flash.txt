Flashes of light coming from single point in the night sky and not travelling as a satellite would do.;2015-04-12 21:30:00;15 seconds;flashes of light coming from single point in the night sky and not travelling as a satellite would do. I know what satellites look like as they flash when travelling across the sky.  What I saw seemed very different.  It was a series of bright flashes coming from a single point in the sky.  Sort of like if someone were to turn a flashlight on and off a few times in the dark.   I'm pretty careful not to jump to conclusions, so just chalked this up to strange and unusual.  I've had a couple of other strange and unusual sightings, this one not as impressive - but it seemed strange nevertheless so posted it.
