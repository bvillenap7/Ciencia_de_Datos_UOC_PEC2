A spectacular flash appeared to the northeast, about 23:30 on 30th August 2003, illuminating East Vernon Hill, lasting several seconds.  The light was lemony with a bluish tinge in colour.  There was no sound.  We (2 middle-aged women) were part of a 'Citizens on Patrol' group formed in the rural area, just north of Vernon to patrol our area for possible fires. Shifts last 2 hours. We had signed up for the 10-12 midnight shift.We live 45 minutes north of Kelowna in the interface between the city of Vernon and crown land.  We were near the north end of Hartnell Road, coming down the road when we saw a brilliant flash to the northeast, illuminating the mountain behind.  As suddenly as the flash appeared, it disappeared. The energy required to illuminate the mountain (East Vernon Hill) must have been enormous. Neither of us had seen anything like this before. As you can imagine, given the fire danger, we were anxious to find out if this event had fire potential. The sky was clear and cloudless so we discounted lightning...did not see another flash thereafter. Also, there was no sound accompanying the flash.  We wondered if it was part of a meteor shower but have no explanation for what we saw.;50.231528;-119.243042
Huge Fireball sited crossing sky in Vernon BC Canada early morning July 17th 2014;2014-07-17 01:15:00;20-30 seconds;Huge Fireball sited crossing sky in Vernon BC Canada early morning July 17th 2014 July 16-17, 2014   My friend and myself were sitting  on my boat deck in the middle of Okanagan Lake near Vernon, BC, star gazing into a very clear sky at approximately 01:10 AM  No drugs or alchohol were a factor in this siting report.  We were sitting  looking at the stars facing west when I was first to see a huge round object coming across the sky from northeast to west.  It  was a gigantic fireball crossing the sky.  I was watching it and alerted my friend to turn and see as well. At first, it appeared to be low in the sky, thinking we were to witness a  huge plane about to crash.  Then we realized  no sound was coming from it and the scale of its size and speed came into perspective. It had to be very high in  the stratosphere.  Total time elapsed was 15- 20 seconds observing it travel. Comparing it to the size of the moon in full phase, it would be  approximately 10 percent of the size of a full moon, based on the half moon that night.  Gigantic sheets of flame were coming off it and speed was exeptionally high, guessing 6-8 times faster than any stratospheric jet speed.   I saw it first  and then drew attention my buddys attention to it.   This was huge and we thought as it crossed out  of view aver the mountain  we would see an explosion perhaps. We are wondering whether we saw an asteroid not pubicized, but a close call no  mentioned. Possibly space craft coming out of orbit? No mention any were todate and unsettling. The only thing  we saw on line next day was a report about a hole discovered in Siberia? Hope we have contributede to something here and will love to see an another verification on line.
