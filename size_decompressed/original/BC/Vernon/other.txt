HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Beam of light running across the night sky.;2003-07-28 00:00:00;approx 45 minutes;Beam of light running across the night sky. Received: April 9, 2004  It was about midnight that I went outside for a smoke, and right outside my door and above me, (I am about 15 km due North of Vernon) looked like a giant spotlight in the sky, with no source and no obvious end. It seemed to skirt the horizon above me, but also seemed to hang low...however, it was hard to distinguish the distance/height of it, it was just so big.  I kind of shook my head and squinted my eyes to make sure I wasn't seeing things, because it was completely out of place/abnormal. I thought at first it was a cloud, illuminated by the moon, but there was no moon visible, and it was not a typical, random cloud-shape. My second thought was northern lights, but it clearly wasn't them, either, as it did not move, change shape, or have any colour to it, aside from a while glow, which seemed to actually give off a good amount of light, similar to a full moon. It was shaped like a tube, perfectly smooth and round with well defined edges, but no real substance (I briefly wondered if it was some sort of UFO, but the lack of substance to it convinced me it was not).  I hope this helps, I can't think of anything more to add, but will update you if I do. Keep up the good work!  My many thanks to the witness for their report.

I watched for a few minutes and it stopped dead in the sky. Then it went back the same way it came.;50.231528;-119.243042
HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  A weeks reports, one witnesses sightings.;2004-02-14 20:10:00;unknown;A weeks reports, one witnesses sightings. Received Report: February 14, 2004 The Week of February from the 8 to the 12  The following report has been difficult to put into description. I have never seen this before and it is hard to describe something to others without comparing it to familiar things. I have very little to compare it to except science fiction and special effects that have been in popular movies.  I live Vernon facing west. My view has a ridge of hills about 900 to 1200 ft on either side. In the centre is the airport and moving west further is a small inlet leading to Okanagan Lake. On the other side of Okanagan lake are mountains.  The current events are taking place on the north ridge of the airport in the western direction.  Monday  Tonight at 8:10 pm a star rose vertically over the ridge. The star was a bright white and golden light surrounded by a bubble (aura) reflecting the inner swirling colors, of green, blue, orange and pink. This light moved vertically to about an angle of 30 degrees in the sky. It moved horizontally south to hover over the down slope of the hill.  Inside of the bubble the light expanded to a large spinning ball of flame orange color. It then changed into what appeared to resemble a vehicle with two headlights, changed back to the ball and then to the vehicle. After the changes the bubble disappeared. The size of the bubble is of a pencil eraser held at arms length and the distance from me is about 7 k.  This happened in the time it takes to blink three times. The two large headlights had one green flashing light on one side and two flashing red lights on the other suggesting a shape of a vehicle. I do not get enough time to get a shape of the body but it does not reflect any light as does the body of an airplane. The vehicle hovered then the headlights turned away from me and headed south slower than an airplane can fly at landing.  Wednesday  Tonight at 6:30 pm in the same area as the other sighting a large cloud lit up like a patio lantern with white light. The two lights appeared coming out of the cloud near the top of the cloud. The headlights moved slowly over the same area as the other and then the lights were switched off. The lights were switched on and the vehicle turned south. As I watched the flashing red lights head south, the flashers were switched off.  Thursday  Tonight at 6:30 pm, two headlights crested the hill. Tonight it was different as the vehicle seemed to be outlined in a webbing of strung golden yellow lights reminding me of Christmas lights. There was still no detail of the vehicle but it was covered in this netting effect. It rose to about 40 degrees in the sky, moved south into the valley and stopped. The golden glow dimmed and three large circular lights in triangular formation came on underneath the vehicle. I watched it slowly head south and could see it until it dissappeared over the top of the hill and highway 97 to Kelowna. It was followed by alot of flashing red and green lights,suggesting something huge or several of the smaller ones described above.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  I saw a small ship, silver and reflecting the sun.;2004-03-29 17:30:00;5 minutes;Hello Brian  I was watching the contrails in the sky as they were odd. The one I was watching had the appearance of a large plane contrail, two thick and twisting trails leading into thinner lines and disappearing. I looked in the binoculars to see what plane left this trail. At the head of the trail there was no plane body. There was instead 5 distinct shapes and their trails were merging into two. The body looked like a cloud hand in a fist. As it approached the ground the fingers were slightly opening. I saw a small ship, silver and reflecting the sun. It was about a centimeter long (in the binos) and it was circling the area where the trail ended. It was an eliptical plate in shape and the back end had a red marker on it. I don't know for sure if the mark was  chevron shaped. As the ship circled the area moving with speed I noticed it was doing rollovers and would dissapear and reapear in the sunlight. This sighting occured in the sw sky over the mountains and Okanagan Lake between Vernon and Kelowna. The ship I saw headed SE. The total time was approx. five minutes from watching the contrail descend to the ship leaving the area.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Object was gold with red underneath.;2004-04-08 23:00:00;approx: 3 seconds;Object was gold with red underneath. Hello Brian  Last night around 11 pm in the western sky something came in from the south west to the northwest. It came in at about twenty degree angle, was gold with red underneath, left short bright yellow gold trail and slowed down before the horizon. Time was about 3 seconds.A shooting star leaves long trails, and a meteor increases speed before impact, or burns out leaving smoky trails. This sighting had neither one of these behaviors. It was something different.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Object flared 3 times heading north, dimmed to gold.;2004-05-19 22:30:00;varies;Object flared 3 times heading north, dimmed to gold. Hello Brian  I live in an apartment facing west so I only have a 180 degree view which means that I do not know what happens behind me to the east. Last night I had my pen and paper ready to record the times of sightings. These UFOs have a pattern of some sort.If they are at a really high altitude they move as gold globes. They appear at a lower altitude as a white moving star. Then as they move they brighten and/or dim to gold or orange globes before they seem to vanish. A couple of times I have also seen after the star that they become spiky white light and as they move they start to strobe before they become the gold globe and disappear. The sightings last from 3 to 10 seconds and they cover about (approx) five miles, if they are low.  The sky had clouds around the horizon.  10:30 globe appeared white just below and north of Leo in west sky, flared 3 times heading north,dimmed to gold  10:35 another one appeared from same place, flashed,strobed,as it flew into the horizon cloud heading north, appeared to be higher altitude from the first one  10:45 gold globe appeared from same place did not flare,headed north  10:55 another flared low in the west sky,dimmed as it headed north  11:00 another gold globe appeared coming from the south flying directly overhead under the big dipper heading north  11:01 white star big and bright as Jupiter appeared low in west and flew directly over my building heading east, I guess approx. under 20,000 ft,staying white  11:15 white globe heading south directly overhead. In south became spiky white light and I saw some color flashes,of red and blue, my view became obstructed.  11:20 gold globe flying by Jupiter heading north  11:40 gold globe changing to orange appeared flying south above Jupiter These sightings are silent, no apparent contrails or burn off.  11:45 a jet airliner flew west. This brought reality back as it made noise, was identifiable by flashing red and white lights surrounding a vehicle. I compared my sightings with the altitude and speed of this jet. The globes were way above and just below this height if the jet was at 20,000 ft. and they moved a little slower. The heavy clouds had by now covered most of the north western sky,and scattered cloud above.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

Multiple lights of red, green, blue and white blinking and hovering in the sky.;2013-08-10 23:00:00;1 hour;Multiple lights of red, green, blue and white blinking and hovering in the sky. I seen a formation of blinking lights hovering in one location, the lights were green, red and blue.  I seen these same lights last week in a different location, my friend, who lives 20 miles South of me seen them also last week and when I called her last night,  she could see the same thing closer to her place at the same time as I was witnessing these ones, so there are more than one of these hovering around this area.   During the day here approximately 2 weeks ago, I see a silver orb heading West in the sky away from Vernon.  Three of us witnessed it.  I took a video with my iPhone and took pictures, you can see the flashing lights in the video, but the pictures aren't clear.;50.231528;-119.243042
