Circular Object over Vernon, BC May10/11;2011-05-10 17:15:00;~45 minutes;Circular Object over Vernon, BC May10/11 UFO Sighting in Vernon ~1715 to ~1800, May 10/11  Object seen ~7 degrees above and to the left of the moon (at First Quarter), slowly moving (imperceptibly) over the following ~3/4 of an hour to a position ~15 degrees above and to the right of the moon.  (I have a ruler for this, as I do look at the night sky). At first, saw it with 7 X 26 binoculars while watching planes, birds and the moon.  Then it could be spotted by eye, once I knew where it was, as it had lots of brilliance (white, not metallic - much brighter than the moon).  It was definitely round.  At times the brilliance seemed to change somewhat but that might have been an illusion. I went to get my Celestron SkyMaster 25 X 100 binoculars, and although it was handheld, the view was quite striking. At the time, my wife was in the kitchen, and I went to tell her to come and see - she did see it also, through the 7 X 26 binoculars, after she was told to go “from the moon, then up and slightly yo the left”.  She told me that I needed the tripod, and I showed her the 25 X 100 binoc. and the camera which I also had by then. Photo takes with (cheap) camera - Sony (5.1 Megapixels) DSC-P93A, zooming ~12X. Near the end of the sighting, I had again switched to the 7 X 26 binoculars, and suddenly, it got smaller, zigzagged very fast, became a dot (still zigzagging at that point!) and disappeared.  I kept looking, as if it was a balloon, the fabric could perhaps be spotted, but I couldn’t see it coming down. Please, if you know what happens when a balloon reached a high altitude and blows up, please let me know. Sorry, a few years ago I saw something and regrettably failed to report, so this time, an effort is being made. I am working on a tripod with screw drive mechanism to go up and down, etc., but it was not yet ready today - otherwise, there would be a fair photo, with the camera through the 25 X 100 binoculars.;50.231528;-119.243042
