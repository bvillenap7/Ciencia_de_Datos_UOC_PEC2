Very strange bright cigar shaped object in the southwestern sky.;2005-12-05 16:05:00;7 minutes;Very strange bright cigar shaped object in the southwestern sky. My 2 daughters and I were driving home from school.  On the way up the hill to our home, we saw a very bright elongated light in the south southwest sky.  It was about 4:05 pm and dusk was falling.  The sky was a clear midnight blue and there were very few clouds.   The unknown object was to the right of the moon and a bright planet (I think venus...).  I stopped the car to establish a  point of reference and determined that the object did not seem to be moving.  It was far in the distance and did not look like anything that I have ever seen before.   We decided to drive down a different road to get another look.  As we drove it started to fade away.  It eventually became a grey streak in the sky and then completed disappeared.  My daughter said it looks like someone cut a gash in the sky and was shining a light through it.   I agree.  It even seemed to seal itself and disappear.   Very, very odd!;50.231528;-119.243042
