HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Large bright florescent green colored round ball of light.;2003-11-15 21:00:00;4 to 5 seconds;Large bright florescent green colored round ball of light. I took a call from a lady who is living in the Vernon area, she was sitting in her living room watching television when something bright caught her attention. She reports seeing a large bright florescent green colored round ball of light traveling horizontally across the sky from the north to southwest. She reports no tail or trail following the object. She observed the object for approx: 4 to 5 seconds before she lost sight of it. Also the witness told me that there was a low cloud ceiling that evening and the green object was well below it. No unusual maneuvers or sound were noted. Now depending how far the object was away from the object, giving me a rounh idea to it's size, she said that it was very large. The lady told me if she held her hand out at arms length, it would have filled her hole thumb.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Object descend into the trees on the hill directly south of Vernon airport.;2003-11-30 16:45:00;8 to 9 minutes;Object descend into the trees on the hill directly south of Vernon airport. Hello Brian  On November 30. Sunday at 4:45 p.m. I was watching a bright white light hovering low in the south west horizon. It was in the wrong place for Venus. A few minutes of observation and I knew it wasn't a plane or a helicopter. At about 4:50 it was slowly moving toward the west. It remained a bright white light. A few minutes later and I watched it descend into the trees on the hill directly south of Vernon airport. Through the binos I watched it disappear from sight, and the bottom of the light seemed to turn orange red as if it was shutting down.  Then just over the lake my eye caught strobing lights moving too fast for a small plane about to land.I saw an  orb ascend quickly  towards (sort of) the north from the lake and in the binoculars it seemed to go right by a plane heading southwest.  The plane was low (approx. 15,000 ft) with its wing lights on.The orb had pink strobing lights but was barely visible to the naked eye.The orb reminded me of the globes that appear when Ghosts are filmed. Nebulous but there.The sky was still in its final colors of sunset, though the sun was long gone.  Wow. was I excited. take care  Thank you to the witness for the report.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  A red sphere flashed by going south.;2003-12-03 16:45:00;20 minutes;Hi Brian  December 3 at 4:45 p.m. the bright white light appeared over the hill south of the airport. The sky was clear after sunset. It hovered and sparkled. A red sphere flashed by going south. My neighbor came out on his balcony for a cigarette. The white light hovered. When he went in it started it's  vertical decent. It went down very slowly a bit at a time until it disappeared in the trees, at 500 p.m.  It is difficult to describe the light. In the binoculars it has strobing red and other colours but white is the predominant one. It is white hot like a sparkler and hard to tell size or shape. I find it hard to believe that no one else has reported this as it is predominant in the sw sky and by the airport. It went down just before a jet landed. There is a population density around the airport and surrounding hills, and again I can't be the only one who sees this.  The behavior of the light suggests that some people at a glance would view it as a star or a one spotlight plane on approach. It makes no sudden moves, as it moves in increments. This is a wonder-full event, lasting 20 minutes, from when I start viewing it.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

Two bright lights moving rapidly and erratically in the evening sky outside of vernon bc.;2013-09-16 17:45:00;<2 minutes;two bright lights moving rapidly and erratically in the evening sky outside of vernon bc I was looking just north of east across the valley towards the hills/mountains and noticed first one and then another identical bright white light.  They moved rapidly and erratically up and down and left and right in and out of the clouds.  The clouds were quite heavy and the objects where sometimes obscured by them.  They then both disappeared into the clouds.  Their movement was not synchronized.;50.231528;-119.243042
A group of 9 moving stars heading east that were popping into the sky one after another.  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-02-16 19:00:00;20 minutes;A group of 9 moving stars heading east that were popping into the sky one after another, they were appearing through a hole in the sky I was looking up in the sky when I noticed a fast moving light (that looked like a star) heading east across the sky.  After watching it for some time I looked back to its origin.  Then out of no where I saw another one begin to follow the one I had just seen.  I called my wife and granddaughter to come out and see what I was seeing and then another light appearing from the same origin in the sky as the others.  These star like lights were appearing and following each other out of nowhere, one after another.  This same event kept happening as we counted 9 in total, popping out of the same spot in the night sky like they were coming through a hole in the sky.  They bright and appearing to be as high as the regular stars.  Quite incredible.  I checked local websites to see if anyone else had witnessed this, but no luck.  Wow I tell ya! Wow!;50.231528;-119.243042

I saw another heading the same direction 2 seconds after, my eye went to the origin of these lights and I saw another one come out of the sky like through a door.  This continued as me and my wife and granddaughter watched.;50.231528;-119.243042
