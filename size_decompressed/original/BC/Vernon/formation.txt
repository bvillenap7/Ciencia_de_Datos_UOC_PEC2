2 Bright Orange pulsing lights, possibly connected,  hover and rotate around Vernon, BC.;2013-03-01 21:30:00;3-5 minutes;2 Bright Orange pulsing lights, possibly connected,  hover and rotate around Vernon BC I was relaxing listening to Music with my two buddies.  I looked out the window down the valley towards Okanagan Lake when I spotted two lights in the sky approximatley 100m away from eachother.   The two lights were orange and were growing brighter and dimmer, almost like a flickering fire in the distance.  The lights never grew further or closer apart from eachother and hovered slowly through the valley rotating end over end and staying the same distance away from eachother.   I went outside to see if I could hear hellicopter blades, but there was no noise.  The object or objects would move and rotate and for about 30 seconds it just stayed stationary.   We watched in awe as we discussed the possibilites of a UFO sighting, whatever we saw we all agreed it wasn't normal.   The Lights continued down the valley no faster than a hellicopter and no higher than the valley mountain tops untill one light went out of vision and then 20 seconds later the second one foll! owed.;50.231528;-119.243042
