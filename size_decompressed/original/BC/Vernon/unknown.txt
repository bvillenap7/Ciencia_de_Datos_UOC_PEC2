HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Lights were on the ground and randomly flashing colors.;2003-04-20 14:00:00;30 minutes;Lights were on the ground and randomly flashing colors. We observed together on a knoll next to Davidson's Orchards twinkling lights. The sky was overcast at 2 in the afternoon with a low ceiling. There was no action at the airport. Davidson's is north overlooking south to the airport and my view is west. Earlier two army choppers flew slowly through the valley.The army was doing maneuvers around Vernon the previous week. At first we thought it was a signaling system that the army was trying as the army camp is directly south and in view of Davidson's Orchards.  The lights were on the ground and randomly flashing colors of pink,red,green blue and brilliant white. We looked through the binoculars and there were no people around it. We have agreed the size comparable to a single dwelling house. The knoll is about one kilometer away as the crow fly's. We watched it for about one half hour.  As an after thought the white light had a shadow line (my last report) which was not in the piece that broke away but remained in the curling end. I was thinking of a description. if I put a dot on a flashlight lens and then blew smoke in the ray the light behaved something like that. It swirled around the shadow line. I had to let the memory come unaided. I observed more than I thought. Because of the other sighting on the same hill (small mountain maybe 900 m) I had a feeling of X marks the spot. Two days ago I noticed a chopper circling the hill then it widened to the surrounding area.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.

Bright white lights, coming up out of a valley, straight up and out.;2007-03-16 18:20:00;less than a minute;Bright white lights, coming up out of a valley, straight up and out. I was driving South on Highway 97 at @ 6:20pm PST, just past Spallumcheen, when I saw bright white lights fly up from between a small valley outside of Vernon B.C.(Coldstream) I didn't see the craft land, but it was so close down to the Earth, maybe it did. I watched as the bright lights on the craft flashed around. The lights on the craft were all white and it rose up out of the valley, at about a 15 degree angle, almost straight up, at too fast a rate for it to be anything that man's made. Then it hovered way up in the sky for about 10 seconds and then zigged for 2 seconds & zagged for another 2, and then took off straight up and out.;50.231528;-119.243042
