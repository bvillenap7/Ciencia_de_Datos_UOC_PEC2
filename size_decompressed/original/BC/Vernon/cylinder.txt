I have no idea what this was. It appeared to be a large upright cylinder of multi-colored flashing light(s). It hovered on occation and moved slowly, until it disappeared shortly after I took the video.  Here is the link to the video of my sighting, there is further description to the right of the video:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=830z3zZLHwk;50.231528;-119.243042
