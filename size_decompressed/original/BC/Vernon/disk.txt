HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  An object was cut into six section.;2003-07-27 02:00:00;approx 20 minutes;An object was cut into six section. A nice lady (a grandma) called me and told me that she and her grandchildren were having a camp out of their patio as it was a beautiful warm night on July 27, 2003. She went on to say she had a very strange experience and saw something she could not explain. They have a large deck which faces south. Due to her having some trouble sleeping the lady awoke and around 2:00 a.m. and wondered around her deck looking up at the starry night sky. As she faced the south and looked up over a valley just west of town she spotted something very large. From her advantage point it looked about cup size. The witness said the object looked like a disc, or wheel shaped standing on it's edge. She also added it looked as if the object was cut into six section. Just like as if you were to cut 6 or 8 pieces of pie (6 or 8 triangular shaped pieces).  There were lights running around the object, all white in color. The lady also said there were a good number of lights on it, but was not sure just how many there were. She also believes the lights were moving around the object. There was no sound heard coming from the unknown and her thoughts were whatever it was, was not all that far away from their property.  The object sat stationary, it did not move. Using some of the structures on their deck to keep track of the object,  she eventually said it started moving but very slowly, but faster than any of the nighttime stars, etc.. After a period of time, the object disappeared.  Thank you to the witness for the report.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.
