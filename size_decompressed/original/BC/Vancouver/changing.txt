Looked like one object. Very fuzzy at first with a faint red glow and tail similar to what a distant comet looks like. The object moved from East to West towards our position until reaching close to directly overhead. At this point the object seemed to change it's appearence and stopped it's Westward course. The object then appeared to change shape from the original 'comet' to more of a 'crumpled paper' shape. At this point it seemed to start reflecting points of red light with some white. From here the object began to move in a Southerly direction, but only slightly while seemingly gettting farther away with it's color only being white. It became harder to focus on until it completely dissapeard. The two main reasons we are reporting this would be the objects movement along with it's shape and color changing. Movement and speed changes did not suggest any type of craft that either of us would know of and the color changes were just strange.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
