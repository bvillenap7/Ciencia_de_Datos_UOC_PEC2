Object was quite large and disappeared over buildings or skyline of city. Unusual because at this time the sky was quite light. I didn't have headlamps turned on. On Sept.28,1998 at approx. 7:25 pm I was driving eastward on 2nd Ave. in Vancouver approaching Main Street. From the corner of my eye to the left of the steering wheel I spotted a flash of light. As I focussed I saw a orange fireball descending into the atmosphere or speeding east in the early evening sky. The object was quite large, slightly smaller then the full moon from the city vantage. The centre of the object was orange and it was glowing white/orange. The fireball disappeared at the height of the buildings or treeline. At this time it was early dusk and quite light in the sky. I could only see one bright star visable and was light enough I did not have my headlamps turned on. There was plenty of traffic. This is downtown Vancouver. I had one passenger with me. I asked him if he saw it! He described the same thing I witnessed. He has made a taped statement for me.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
Spinning ball of fire that disappeared , and army helicoters going by.;2000-11-30 16:00:00;10 seconds;Spinning ball of fire that disappeared , and army helicoters going by. I saw what seemed to be a spinning ball of fire extremly , it lasted about 12 seconds and It seemed to be by Mt.Baker. About 5 mins after I saw it 2 army helicopters went by the area.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
Meteor enters end exits the atmosphere!;2001-07-11 21:10:00;20 minutes;Meteor enters end exits the atmosphere! Long white streak in the sky above where the sun had just set - became bigger and began to move downwards from a 2 0'clock position in the North-western sky.  after about ten minutes it was moving faster and faster eventually revealling a very bright head at the bottom end of the streak - I then realized that the streak was actually the tail.  At the height of the event, it was moving  as fast as a jet across the sky and the head was very bright.  Suddenly the streak (tail) disapeared and about a second later apearred on the opposite side of the head (in a 10'clock position).  At that moment it stopped moving downwards and seemed to stay in a relatively stable position moving slightly upwards again in the distance.  After this it just got smaller and smaller as it faded towards the horizon.  All in all this occurred between 9:05 and 9:25 pm with the most dramatic part being about 30 seconds.  VERY dramatic and bright - I was walking across the Granville st. bridge from work and myself, a co-worker and at least 15 other people stopped and stood viewing what was happenning.  I phoned the news stations when I got home, but although they said they had recieved calls about it, without camera footage they did not care.  In retrospect it seemed to have been a comet or meteor entering and exiting the atmosphere with the moment when the tail suddenly changed direction probably being the time when it was closest to the Earth (and land/water).  Actually scared the #*!@ out of me during that moment because it was so bright and fast (and probably a HUGE object up there). ((NUFORC Note:  NUFORC received a telephone call from a Vancouver, B.C., radio station, reporting that witnesses had reported the event to them, too.  We have not idea what the witnesses observed, but our first guess would be a contrail from a high flying jet.  However, the witnesses insist that they were not looking at a contrail.  We do not know what caused this sighting report.  PD));49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
8-15 fireballs seen moving at different speeds, mostly landing (probably) in water, one exploded;2002-07-13 01:30:00;02:10;8-15 fireballs seen moving at different speeds, mostly landing (probably) in water, one exploded 3 people saw from 8 to 15 brightly glowing fireballs in the northern sky of the west end of Vancouver, BC, Canada. Most of them were descending towards the water behind a mountain, some fairly quickly, but some extremely slowly. One moved in a zig-zag pattern. All of these fireballs left behind trails of smoke, but the 3 of us cannot agree whether it was dark or light smoke. Most of the object appeared fairly high in the sky and descended, however, a few were seen moving upwards from ground level, and one moved up from the ground, then descended again, towards solid ground, and then shot up bright sparks and a plume of white smoke. The objects may have been shaped like discs seen edge-on, or possibly like shooting stars, only moving very slowly. They may also have been spherical, we were quite far away, and using binoculars, so we didn't see them very well. The objects were quite bright, and when they fell behind the mountain, some of them produced enough orange glow to light up the sky in the area where they fell. The objects may have been flickering or flashing, but this may also have been a dust effect due to our distance. In the beginning, one of us suggested that they might be forest fires, but we soon disproved that - forest fires do not start so high in the air, and do not land in the water.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  It was large and had a long flaming/ sparking tail.;2003-11-07 17:00:00;3 seconds;Last night about 17:00 I saw a huge fiery meteor fly across the sky heading for the mountains... just wondering if any one else saw it. It was going from south to north.. over Barrard Inlet  ... It seemed to land in the mountains. It was large and had a long flaming/ sparking tail. It was a bright white or yellow in color. Only lasted a few seconds as it was moving fast... I have seen similar pictures of other things like it lately in the news......... It was really neat to see... I was sure some one else had to have seen it but have found no reports any where.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

green fireball shoots across the sky westward  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor.  PD));2005-04-19 00:07:00;2 seconds;green fireball shoots across the sky westward it's 12:23 am pacific right now.  roughly 15 minutes ago, i was backing into my garage, which faces west/sout west.  while backing in, i saw a green fireball shoot across the sky, westward.  it was green and disappeared right away.   i thought it was a flare or roman candle at first, but then seconds later, i realized there was no way it could have been a roman candle. this thing looked like the typical shooting star you see on tv.  it just shot through the sky.  definitely not a roman candle.  it was not a flare either.  could have been a meteor, but there was no sonic boom or anything. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible meteor, we suspect.  We reported sighting to meteor trackers in B.C..  PD));49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
Three green Orbs spotted over Vancouver, BC Nov13th at 11:15 pm;2009-11-13 23:15:00;15 seconds;Three green Orbs spotted over Vancouver, BC Nov13th at 11:15 pm I was very tired when I wrote the first sighting description and I have corrected my grammer in this one. Please use revised addition. Last night, Nov 13th, 2009, was the only clear night I've been able to use my telescope in over 3 weeks.  At approx 11:15 pm I saw three low flying silent green orbs traveling from east to west at low altitude. They followed the normal flight path that commercial aircraft use to land in Vancouver.  I am very familiar with commercial aircraft, however I was not able to identify these objects.  The last of the three appeared to be a glowing disc flying through the night sky as if a green halo around the craft itself. Now I am going to speculate and offer my own explanation.  Stealth aircrafts have their afterburners turned up so that they are not heard easily from the ground at low altitude.  There also might be a green light on the top of the aircraft.  As the afterburn of fuel from their engines is directed upwards it might have caused condensation to form thus appearing as a glowing green object from the ground in the cool temperature.  I guesstimate the speed at approximately 700-1000 miles per hour yet no sonic boom which is curious indeed.  However we know this technology has been worked on for years to what level of success I don’t know.  We also know that a condensation halo can be formed around an aircraft at speed depending on atmospheric conditions. I am an amateur astronomer and have been for years but I've never ever seen anything like this before either prior or post military.  I don’t want to say that they were extraterrestrials but I really don’t have any explanation for this at all.  I always like to error on the side of caution. However, the sight of these objects was really something!   One more thought, due to Olympics we know they’ve been flying aircraft over Vancouver city often.  But not like these ones I think!  Any thoughts?  I would like someone to hopefully respond with an objective opinion.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657

Green Fireball sighting at the edge of Stanley Park in Vancouver BC Canada;2013-01-08 20:00:00;3 seconds;Green Fireball sighting at the edge of Stanley Park in Vancouver BC Canada I observed what looked like a green fireball shoot like a rocket horizontally parallel to the ground about 10 metres high off the ground.  It lasted about 3 seconds and disappeared, there was no noise.   It was 8 pm - still broad daylight and I was coming out of Stanley Park - there were a few cars driving by but I'm not sure whether they noticed anything - it was very fast.  It seemed like such a natural thing to see that I first thought it was a shooting star.  My second thought was that shooting stars cannot be seen in daylight and not so low to the ground and certainly not neon green! I didn't think about it again till today when I found a note in Wikipedia about green fireballs  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_fireballs  I'm still not certain what I saw can be described as a fireball but it was rocketing green neon ball of light that disappeared into nothing - quite low to the ground.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
