Ball of light low in sky descending slowly at steep angle from East to West;1998-09-24 21:15:00;5 seconds;Ball of light low in sky descending slowly at steep angle from East to West At approximately 9:00-9:30 pm, i was looking out a south facing window and witnessed a ball of light descending across my field of view from East to West.  The light appeared too large, moved at a rate to quickly, and angle to steep for it to be an airplane.  It also moved to slowly for it to seem like a shooting star.  It did not leave a trail. The path of the object was linear and did not vary, and descended from east to west at an angle of approx. 30 degrees. The light from the object seemed very white. I only witnessed it for a period of less than 5 seconds before my view was obstructed.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
white circle one quarter size of full moon appeared NNW, sky, disappeared SSEsky, no trail.;1999-01-22 18:42:00;2 seconds;white circle one quarter size of full moon appeared NNW, sky, disappeared SSEsky, no trail. At 18:42 PST my mother let our two small dogs out into the back yard and was standing on back porch waiting for them to come back in.  She looked up at the sky and saw a white circle about the size of a small pea held at arm's length or one quarter size of a full moon.  She said it suddenly appeared in the North to Northwest sky and was visible for about 1.5 to 2 seconds as it sped toward the SSE sky and suddenly disappeared.  There was only the one object and the sky was partially obscured by a layer of cirrostratus cloud.  She called to me and I went out to look at the sky.  The object was gone by this time but I did note the cloud cover and that I was able to see a slightly fuller than crescent moon and some brighter stars through the thin cloud cover.  She said there was no trail behind the object and it didn't look like a fireball.  My mother is a retired store manager and I am a  librarian.  She informed me the following day that the new space station was apparently visible in the sky during the time she saw the object.  This brings up many questions. It moved from the NW horizon to the SE in under 2 seconds.  If it indeed was the space station she saw, is it capable of such speed?  Is it tumbling which would cause it to reflect the sun's light and then seem to disappear?   Is it's orbit in a NW to SE direction?   My mother feels that is what she saw--the new space station.  But I am not so sure.  About 2-3 minutes before she saw the object the was a loud rumble like a sonic boom.  It definitely was not thunder the sky was basically clear and here on the west coast of British Columbia we get few thunderstorms mainly from April to early September.   Thank you for your time.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
Large circular energy mass moving slowly across horizon;2001-04-06 22:30:00;1 hour;Large circular energy mass moving slowly across horizon Observed bright multicoloured lights in SW sky.  Through the telescope appeared as an energy mass of concentric circles (like rings on a tree) with pulses of energy emitting from the centre.  Moved slowly over the course of an hour across the skyline and disappeared to the west.  Observable across the city by the naked eye.  That's no space station!;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
Fireball Over Vancouver BC, Pacific Northwest.;2001-07-07 04:20:00;7 seconds;Fireball Over Vancouver BC, Pacific Northwest. I am a 28 year old professional Administrator. During the wee hours on Saturday morning July 7th approx 4:20 am, I was making overseas telephone calls and gazing out my east facing windows. I live on the 18th floor and have an unobstructed view of the mountains to the northeast, Burnaby City, and Mt. Baker. It was a clear crisp evening and I was looking directly out the window when I witnessed a huge fireball approx. 1/2 the size of the hay moon that evening. It streaked in an arch from  south to northeast for approx 6/7 seconds appearing to be directly over Burnaby (Although probably farther past) Judging by the size and the intensity (Red/Orange with short trail) My first thought was that it might have hit either mid BC or into the rockies??? I was unable to get any information on it the next day and local news desks received nothing over their wires? I've asked just about every night-owl and insomniac I know and no one observed it. I'm quite certain this was not the Linear A2 commet due to its size and visibility. It was stunning!...Anyone??!!! ((NUFORC Note:  No other reports from Vancouver.  Local astronomers did not pick it up on their sky cameras on Gabriola Island or in Victoria.  PD));49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657

7-8 object seen;2007-08-01 00:15:00;15-20 sec;7-8 object seen Went out on my deck to have a smoke and was looking at how clear the stars were and was shocked to see 7-8 objects round with a light orange colour to them, what looked like them leaving the earth they were bunched together with one in the lead.They began to pull away from earth and form into a v-formation with one that looked like it fell behide racing up and taking the lead. They were going at a very high speed faster then a sat goes by about as fast as a jet fighter at 200ft would look but out in space. I couldnt tell how far out they were because i never saw a moon to go by but they had to be quite big for me to see them as far away as i saw them.Thus wasnt birds or a metor shower or anything else that i have ever seen and left me a little shocked;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
large bright object about 5 times thhe size of other stars in the sky. only through binoculars the 8 dull objects are noticed tailing.;2009-07-21 04:00:00;10 Min;large bright object about 5 times thhe size of other stars in the sky. only through binoculars the 8 dull objects are noticed tailing. Visually observed very large distant bright circular object in sky.  Stars were present but only a quarter of the size of this object so I grabbed a pair of binoculars and the bright large circular object had 8 small dull objects tailing behind it in line.  Object moves south bound at a very slow movement until I can no longer see due to a large tree in the distance.  Color of main object was extreme bright and eight tailing objects were a very dull brightness resembled metal type circles and can only be seen via my binoculars.

UFO appears in chemtrail over Vancouver, BC.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a multi-colored kite, we suspect.  PD));2015-03-08 11:00:00;30 minutes;UFO appears in chemtrail over Vancouver, BC. Watching the clear blue sky Sunday morning, when I noticed a high altitude chemtrail being laid from south to north across the sky, about midway across the sky, which basically put this jet almost overhead, but still slightly to the west, appears right out of nowhere virtually almost in the chemtrail, itself a brilliant bright circle of an object,  Imagine venus only In the daytime sky, that would accurately describe the size of this object,  I'm guessing at an altitude of 30,000 plus feet.  This object pulled a straight line from west to east directly overhead of me and took approx 30 min to cover the horizon from west to east,  It never wavered.  It never changed brightness.  It just eventually from what I could tell slowly gained elevation to the point where you could no longer see it In the sky.   I have been sky watching for 40 plus years and NEVER have I seen anything like this, It was fascinating Indeed! ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a multi-colored kite, we suspect.

PD));2015-09-12 05:45:00;hours;It is so bright in the sky to still be there during the sunrise We witnessed one object moving from southwest to northeast at approximately 5:45am.  the most prominent object stands stationary in the eastern sky.  Perhaps a third phenomenon pulsating in the southeastern sky.  The most curious thing is that we haven't seen a plane in the sky throughout this event.  We looked through binoculars without any conclusion.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
Circular orb object over Stem cell Technology Vancouver, BC 75-100 witnesses;2019-02-24 15:00:00;10 minutes;Circular orb object over Stem cell Technology Vancouver, BC 75-100 witnesses I am writing to you with respect to the above subject which occurred on February 24, 2019 at or around 1500 taking place over the Stem cell Technology facility located in Vancouver, BC.  This unusual craft was brought to my attention by a person passing by. I observed this craft with other witnesses. I captured this on my tablet but it’s difficult to make out. It appeared to be metallic, circular in shape, no sound, it had what appeared to be white lights on the bottom of the craft that would illuminate the under airfoil – the lights looked like the large LED lights you see on the big screen TV in stadiums for say a hockey game, and it seemed to be moving incredibly slowly.  This craft had no navigational lights (red & green), no tail, no wings, no visible landing gear, no visible windows. Their were other aircrafts in the area that we could identify and see that they were from Harbor Air & they were fixed wing float planes that appeared to be diverting from the area. At or around 1504 the craft just disappeared. I have raw video in HD. Some people who witnessed this event made all kinds of conjecture, saying it could be drones, could be “demonic” or “inter dimensional. It sure didn’t look like a helicopter & it didn’t have any wings, no markings (identifiable call sign, company logo), no sound & the other aircrafts turned the other way, literally!  I am former student pilot from CZBB and I have experienced “unusual traffic” before but never have attempted to capture the event. Just happened to have my tablet available. *In the videos the craft appears to be this flashing white circular small objet.  It’s hard to see in the video but in person it was much larger & more visible.  In the still images it’s hard to see, but it too looks like a small white bright circular object. Hopefully you or someone can get something out of the videos with an in-depth analysis.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657

The formation was not like the flight path of any planes or helicopters I've ever seen, more like rapid criss cross floating patterns.  I observed the objects for about 2 minutes with 2 other witnesses and then the objects disappeared as quickly as they appeared in the afternoon sky.  At the time of observation, the sky was clear blue with no clouds whatsoever.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
