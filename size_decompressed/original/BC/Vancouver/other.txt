The object was not moving and did not changed during the time I viewed it.  It made no sounds, nor did it interact with anything. It was spherical with two diagonal rings around it in a X shape.   Upon first glance it seemed to be a planet, except it was far too large (several times larger than the average full moon appears to the naked eye).  It appeared to be glowing or at least reflecting light in a fashion similar to earth's moon.  The rings were the exact same colour as the sphere and the diagonal pattern was completely symmetrical (at least to the naked eye).

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  I immediately noticed a bright yellow/red round object  in the sky.;2003-09-12 21:00:00;5 seconds;I immediately noticed a bright yellow/red round object  in the sky. Hello Brian,  I've decided to report a UFO sighting that took place on Friday  9:00 p.m., Sept  12, 2003 . I was leaving from the front of my apartment building on the south side of W.2nd ave and Maple st. in Kitsilano. I immediately noticed a bright yellow/red round object  in the sky, traveling from West to East at about the same height as Grouse mountain. It seemed to be over the Eastern North Shore mountains/Pitt Meadows area, or, even as close as the Second Narrows bridge vicinity.Very difficult to judge the locale, exactly.Anyhow, I watched it for a good 5 seconds before it disappeared behind obstructing buildings in the downtown.  I would like to believe that it was a jet fighter going crazy, but ,no flashing lights or sound. A jet helicopter? Doubtful. Too large and fast, I'm afraid. Again, it was covering a fair distance in the short time I saw, and was changing levels somewhat, giving me the impression that it was almost floating while traveling, rather than going in a directly straight line from West to East.Very interesting, indeed. I wish that I could add more to my story, but that is all I can really tell you.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

Small Orange Object, With a tail. Irratic movements.;2003-10-31 20:30:00;2-5 Minutes;Small Orange Object, With a tail. Irratic movements. The date was October 31 (ironically same date as the war of the worlds hoax). My friend, ((name deleted), and I were sitting on his porch and talking. Then near the horizon, he spotted a stange looking object. It was orange and had a tail.  At first we thought it was a comet, but the object appeared to be changing directions.  Finally it dissapeared into the sunset.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Vancouver area reports.;2004-04-24 21:00:00;Varies;Vancouver area reports. April 24 - 09:00 - Observed white light moving in an easterly direction across Indian Arm from Seymour Mountain. Approx:. 2500 ft. I assumed it was most likely a small plane but noticed it was traveling faster than most. As I watched the white light blinked out. A few seconds later there was a single red strobe flash and then the white light reappeared going back the way it came just as fast. There is no way a small plane could have reversed directions that fast. I grabbed my new Video camera and in the few seconds it took to warm up the light blinked out again. There was still a little light in the sky but I could see nothing in the area. I checked with my binoculars but found nothing..  April. 14 - Approx:. 10:00 PM - Observed what appeared to be a fairly large meteorite heading in a northerly direction. As I watched it suddenly shrank in size and within seconds just appeared to be a satellite still heading in the same direction. Very similar to that object I saw back in the summer of 2002.  I forgot to write this down but it occurred around the beginning of April 2004. The weather was overcast with low thick clouds. Approx:. 5 PM. I was playing on my computer when I noticed, Two dull yellow disk shaped objects, flying one behind the other in a SSE directions. Cloud level was approx:. 1000 ft. and these glowing disks appeared to be either in the clouds or just over them. I would estimate they were about over the area of 108 and King George and from that distance appeared to be about the size of the full moon. Estimated speed approx:. 3 to 4 hundred miles an hour. Time of sighting about five to ten seconds.  My new camera has night vision and can see better than I can in the dark. The other night I saw that strange light which appears to flash white, blue and red. I aimed the camera at it and started zooming in and it must be in near orbit as the image filled my view finder even before it got to full digital zoom. (900X) Normal stars still look like stars slightly magnified. Anyway I did not see the blue and red lights which I've seen through my binoculars but did see reddish looking protudences on the sides. Reminded me of Mickey Mouse. The white object appeared to be rotating quite fast but that may just have been an effect caused by the atmosphere. Just for the heck of it I left the camera running while pointed up at the sky, to my surprise I saw what appeared to be very two very faint satellites pass through the rather narrow field of view within about five minutes. I also noticed several dark shadowy objects passing in front of the stars in the view finder. I tried looking at the same area through my binoculars but could only just barely make out the stars.  One other thing I just remembered I got my new camera on the 13th. of April and spent all afternoon playing with it. My wife was getting annoyed and told me to put it away. About five minutes later I saw what appeared to be a small plane flying by about two blocks from here. The lights didn't look right and it was flying not much higher than my apt. I grabbed my binoculars and took a look but was unable to see the fuselage if it had one. Could only see the lights. Two small lights on what I took to be the nose, one red, one white. Where the wings should be I saw a bright blue light and a red one on the other side both larger then the nose lights, behind the wings? I saw two more lights mounted one behind the other one large white one and a large red one. As it passed the Green tower at City Centre Mall I could see a small white light on its tail. It had been heading east but swung to a southerly heading after passing the tower.  Anyway it looks like it might be a good summer for sightings, hopefully I will manage to get something on tape. I got a little excited this afternoon while playing back my tape from yesterday evening on my TV. I saw this thing with two big yellow lights and what looked light a dark saucer shape in the background, after watching it for a few seconds I realized it was an aircraft with its landing lights on.  I have also noticed a number of times now those single strobe flashes which seem to be coming from space. my camera has picked them up numerous times now. I've played them back one frame at a time and they only seem to last for one frame and I can see nothing around them even with the camera set at about 20X zoom.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

A star-like object moved from the middle of the sky to very end of southeast in 2 minutes;2004-07-13 23:40:00;2 min;A star-like object moved from the middle of the sky to very end of southeast in 2 minutes At the time of spotting, the star-like object traveled from middle of the sky to the southeast end for two minutes, after which I didn't follow. I talked to Peter within 5 min. He said it is very much possible to be a satellite.  To me it is totally a strange object. First it is not a cosmet, which has a tail. Secondly, it is not a meteorstar, which is extremely fast and disappears in seconds. Thirdly, it is not a usual aircraft, which is much much slower. At that moment possibility of satellite did not occur to me.  As an individual ignorant of satellite, I still want to report this event, hoping it may be useful for your analysis.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
UFO in SE sky in Vancouver.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the star Sirius.  PD));2006-10-31 00:00:00;At least one hour;UFO in SE sky in Vancouver As I was standing on the roof deck of building in Gastown, Vancouver, I saw a rather bright, twinkly star just over the horizon in the SE sky. I stared at it for a moment to watch it twinkle and noticed it changed colour. It distinctly changed from red to blue to bright yellow and green.  I went inside and told my spouse about it and ask him to come see it. They recommended I get the binoculars. So we looked through the binoculars, taking turns and were amazed and baffled by what we saw. It was an object suspended in the air that seemed to have at least three lights on it, maybe more, that I could see. The lights covering this object change colours constantly, from red to blue to bright yellow to green to blue to red again, all in the matter of seconds.  This went on for a while so, I took what photos my camera would take and downloaded them. While looking at it with the naked eye I could see no other light near this object, but when I downlaoded the photo, there seemed to be two bright lights in the same vacinity as the one I saw with the binoculars.  My partner and I saw the same thing. We are relaible people who do not make things up, well except for a song every now and then.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the star Sirius.

Then suddenly from a stationary position one star slowly moved in a straight line towards north ( my right) then in an upward dipping motion it shot off into space away from me leaving a trail of light that followed after it. the whole sighting lasted about 6 seconds, its remarkable that i happened to look up and at that point of the night sky to catch it. my friend was speechless.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
flying, stringy, orb, brain shaped object;2007-08-14 16:00:00;1 MIN;flying, stringy, orb, brain shaped object Since what I saw is very difficult to describe I am hoping that someone else out there has seen what I have seen.  The reporting of this event is late yes, however.  As the years go by I feel compelled to report what I have seen. I had just got home from work, sitting on the rear porch waiting for my girlfriend to get home.  I know the date was the 14th, of August 2007 as this day lands between my girlfriends and my sisters/niece birthdays’.  The day was clear, warm with no clouds in site, the time was about 14:00.  The following events only lasted about 45sec-1min, quickly, I realized what I was looking at  something that has not been seen, nor described to me in any way before.  I got a really good look at the object, I knew that taking note of the fine details would help me remember.  Trust me this is something that I will never forget. I sat there looking to the NW direction.  Moving slowly from North to South, I saw, what I can only describe as a “flying brain”.  This may sound funny, however the first thing that came to my mind is that the object was in the shape of a brain (kidney type shape).  The shape of the object did change though.  As it was moving, it would seem to take shape to the wind.  I would not call it round, square, saucer, ball..etc… the color was similar to fire reddish, orange and yellow.  I was not a ball of fire.. I had time to look at this, the following description is “exactly” what I saw.  I will use products to assist with my descriptions, again, I have never seen, nor even been described anything like this before. Altitude:  about 300’ off the ground Size:  about 30-50yards long x 10-15yards total (it was flexing, in the shape of a brain, but moving as it moved) Speed:  about 60km/h  Distinctive features: •	it was stringy.  You could call it a mass of string (like that under a baseball), but the strings was very defined, defined enough that it still strikes me to this day. Colors were vibrant and defined.  You could see the yellow, red, orange.  They were separate from each other and I could tell by looking at it.  This, along with the string was the most amazing part and the part that I cannot explain the best. The strings would move, like tentacles kind of.  They were not all pointing in the same direction, they were moving in different directions while the object moved to the South.  Each string was a defined color, and the color was it’s own.  There was no common pattern of the colors of the strings.  The strings seemed to be different lengths. I saw no lights, no doors/windows (points of access), no writings. It moved in the same direction, did not climb, did not descend. It was silent to me. While watching this, there was one of the neighbours kids playing in our backyard.  I told him to look up at the object.  The child does not speak English, other than a few words.  When he looked up he said “the sun”.  I said to him that yes, it does look like the sun, however it was not.  He did not seem much more interested in the object. I continued to watch it move across the sky.  Within the 45-1 minute time frame, I was able to get a really good look, I wanted to remember this for the rest of my life.  When it went out of view it just went out of view, I cannot say if it sped away or disappeared, it was just out of my view behind buildings. After watching what it was, I looked around to see if anyone else was out side, there was no one.  I looked at the sun myself (maybe the child was right and I am crazy), the sun was not even close, and, did not look like this.  You cannot stare at the sun for 1 minute and expect to see normal again, this was not the sun.  I thought of what the kid said, and yes.  It would resemble the sun in a way.  If you see photos of the sun (close up telescope type), you see the fire leaping from the sun’s surface.  This fire leaping would somewhat resemble the strings that I spoke of earlier, as the color as well.  I know what fire looks like, this was just not fire.. A lot of people laugh when I say it was a flying brain.  I use this description only to describe the shape, and, it was the first thing that came to mind when I saw it.  It was like an orb.  The orb was what appeared to be the main body, strings came off of and all around it.  The orb, when the object moved, would move into a brain shape.  I do laugh at my brain description myself, but, it is what it is.. I do believe in UFO’s, I have seen a lot of unexplained lights and stuff, but, never anything like this, and never anything that I would report as it could be too many other things.  This object is not nothing that I have ever seen.  After seeing this, I am sold that there is something else out there. Anyone that thinks I am full of it, or crazy.  You have your belief and that is just fine.  I am not interested in anything other than trying to find out what this was.  I am not saying that it was visitors from outer space, paranormal or anything else.  I don’t know what to call it, I have never seen anything like it, except on that day. Please, I ask that if you have seen something that resembles this I would love to hear about it.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657

At 12:50 am on Saturday morning Dec 29 2007.  I observed a large emerald green orb appear in the distant North West sky travelling in a Northernly direction and suddenly dropping to its dissapearence. The orb was quite large although it appeared to be distant in the Earths atmosphere.  The road I was travelling on was quite dark which gave a quality sighting. The orb had a small trail of its own light following it that look or appeared as a smudge of light no more than 1/8 to 3/8 its original size.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
