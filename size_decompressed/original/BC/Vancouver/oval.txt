Oval shaped, bright craft, hovering in sky.;2006-09-03 22:20:00;1 minute;Oval shaped, bright craft, hovering in sky. I saw a huge object in the sky over the city, which had bright lights on it.  It was not moving and far too bright and large to be a plane. Very clear sky. I was watching it, then it just dissapeared.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
