Something was sitting up in the sky, somewhat into the clouds, or above some clouds and there were lights coming form it, perhaps 6 or 8 lights, and they were turning around and around and light was being sent out into  the sky and being reflected on the clouds, so it was very high up.  It was stationary whcih caused me to stay and watch.  I thought it might have to do with the movie industry, but then it was so high that it couldn't possibly have been standing on stilts.  I left after 10 or 15 minutes and never was able to figure out what it was.  It stood still for 10 or 15 minutes. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657

Th;1999-08-24 23:15:00;35 min;I noticed what I thought was a star shining way too brightly. I called my wife to have a look and she confirmed that it was no star. There seemed to be many colors flashing. 1 object was seen about 10 inches above the northern mountains ( approx 15 miles distant )There seemed to be a series of pulses of red, amber and green with the occasional blue which was brighter than the other colors. It was moving very slowly in an eastern direction. We scanned the sky and noticed another to the east much farther off and another to the west which was much brighter and semmed to be much closer. I looked with my binoculars and could actualy see that the closest object to the west of us looked to be revolving with the light patterns. My wife looked and confirmed what I was seeing. The fourth object appeared close to the first object and could be seen moving in an easterly direction and went out of sight behind a tree. I'm no expert in judging distances, but I estimate that the closest object in the west had to be at least 100 feet in diameter for us to see it so clearly. It did not appear saucer like at all, but rather more spherical.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657

Static orange garland silently gliding over Vancouver;2000-10-18 20:45:00;less than 1 mn;Static orange garland silently gliding over Vancouver I was looking at the stars from my deck, and suddenly it looked like a curly orangy garland was floating above my head. Then I realized that if it was a garland, I wouldn't see it (since it was dark already) and even if I did, it would be moving in the wind, whereas the shape of what I saw was completely static. So I suddenly realized that I was seeing some flying object, as it was advancing in the air very steadily (not high speed at all), and it looked like I was seeing the back of the object (nothing else showed). I could follow it for maybe 20 or 30 seconds, and then the orangy glow slowly disappeared as it moved further away towards the East. It was absolutely silent and didn't seem very high in the sky (unless it is a gigantic object). Had I not looked up at that very moment (when the garland was vertically above me and the most visible) , I probably wouldn't have noticed the object at all.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  We were treated to a fantastic dance by numerous objects.;2003-08-17 23:45:00;approx: 2 min.;Last night was spectacular. Looking out from Coal Harbour over Lions Gate Bridge, my wife (who is a skeptic) and I were treated to a fantastic dance by numerous objects.  It was not that the binoculars were unsteady, one object would race in all directions in front of another object which remained steady, so there could be no question about what it was doing. The motions, in all directions, including criss-crossing, were incredibly fast - about as fast as the eye could follow. Approx: time viewing objects was 2 minutes.  We are using 10x50 WA binoculars - it would not be readily seen with the naked eye.  Hope you find this information worthwhile reading,  Regards,  Thank you to the witness for the report.

Object in sky illumated by clouds circled the sky over and over again in a small set area.;2003-08-26 23:30:00;half an hour;Object in sky illumated by clouds circled the sky over and over again in a small set area. it was facing south from where i was from, east of where mars was and this orb kept circleling in place over and over again. I could tell it wasnt a search light because there was no stream of light shone from earth, also the light came from above the clouds.  The thing is, you could only really see the light when it was above cloud, when it was in a secton where there was no cloud you could maybe make out a speck but that was it. Towards the end of the duration a second light came out and both circled in place. The speed was fairly quickly, faster than a plane. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  We believe, despite the claim by the witness to the contrary, that some type of searchlight or advertising light would be the first possibility that would have to be ruled out.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  This light that shone through and it kept doing this tiny orbit.;2003-08-26 23:50:00;35 minutes;email report:  My dad has been watching the skies for the last month convinced to find an UFO highway but today August 26th 2003, he made me see something I couldn't explain. I was on the phone with my friend when we saw this thing, so along with her siblings there were about 6 of use who saw it. It was facing south and from my direction I didn't need to tilt my head up to the sky, it was near where mars was at this point and about 5 inches to the east.  My dad called me out around 11:50 pm and it ended at 12:35. It was a cloudy night and underneath the clouds was this light that shone through and it kept doing this tiny orbit. It just kept going and going and at first it was the same tiny orbit but as time went on the course would change slightly and it got bigger and bigger and it seemed that towards the end another object joined the course.  It couldn't have been a light from earth because there was no stream of light and where there was no cloud you couldn't see anything, But where there was a thick cloud cover you couldn't see anything either so if there were a light it would show.  Also the past week my dad would see lights going from south to east in a line and then all of a sudden stopping and then shooting straight up and disappearing. These lights  would travel across the sky quickly. They weren't blinking or anything, I guess kind of... like a moving star.  Ok thanks. I hope you can respond to me.

craft in the distant sky that seemed to be descending, could have been a plane.;2004-05-05 22:05:00;10 seconds;craft in the distant sky that seemed to be descending, could have been a plane. not sure exactly what i saw, could very well be a regular airplane.  i was staring west from my garage, in the distance (i think 20 degrees, not sure how to gauge) i saw some lights, sorta like an aircraft would have.  The way the lights flashed were also odd, but not sure how to describe it and i don't think it matters.  The thing that caught my attention was that this craft seemed to be descending.  it wasn't moving left/right, or toward or away, but it seemed to be slowly falling to the earth.  eventually, some trees blocked my view and i lost sight.  The thing was pretty far away so theres a good chance it was a plane.  but if this thing did indeed descend to earth, then it would have landed on some busy roads where people would see it.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657

Was moving along from east to west at about a 10 to 15 degree angle from east to west. It was moving at the speed of a normal satelite when it stopped and darted away at a 90 degree angle - away from earth. The object was moving along at a good speed, just like the speed of a satelite, it stopped for about a fraction of a second and bolted away from earth and disappeared.  So essentially, this white object is going along about the speed of a satelite, it was definately in space, stops briefly and then bolts away from earth. It was really stange.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
Moving star, moving east in slow, crooked line before veering SE in Vancouver early morning sky.;2014-09-12 05:07:00;5 minutes;Moving &quotstar&quot moving east in slow, crooked line before veering SE in Vancouver early morning sky I was heading to work, when I decided to look up at the night sky to see if there were any Northern Lights visible during the solar flare.  I was looking north and saw 2 stars instead but what caught my eye was that the second star was moving.  Both stars were of the same intensity and brightness to the naked eye and it had not occurred to me it could be a moving object.  The UFO was not bright and blended well with the other night stars.  If it had not moved, you would thought it was just a star.  I initially thought it was a meteor/shooting star, but what made me suspicious was that it moved in a slow, crooked, line, about 1 cm per 1-1.5 sec (take a ruler and move it about 30 cm away from your face/eye and hold the ruler, that is how fast it was moving when you are looking at the night sky, I am not sure how else to describe it).  The star moved east in an obviously crooked line and eventually drifted south-east and disappeared out of sight.  It did not blink so it is unlikely it was an airplane, and it does not have other lights nor was shaped like a triangle so it may not even be a drone at all. It had no other coloured lights nor multiple lights.  The night sky was quiet and that star did not produce any sounds.  The sky was clear with no clouds so visibility was not an issue.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
