Disc in sky;1970-06-15 15:00:00;5min;Disc in sky It was a long time ago but its something you dont forget.Iwas about 10 or 11yrs old and delivering the star weekly.I was opening the gate to enter the yard of an old ladys house to give her the paper when somethig cought my i,up in the sky.It was a pretty clear day eccept for a few clouds, i remembre 4 when i looked up the disc was just sitting there in one spot as high as the clouds, then it darted in one of the clouds, i could still see it,it hezetated for a minute and darted to another one then another all this time i was just standing there looking up with my mouth open.while it was in this white cloud i ran up to the ladys door and banged on it when she answerd i told her to come and look,she told me something about being a kid with a imagination she didnt come out to look,i gave her the paper and ran out to the yard and looked up just as i did it darted over to a big grey cloud i couldnt see it.I waited for a while and gave up.I should say that the clouds were probably a 100 miles or so appart and it took not even a second to get there.

witnessed a disk shaped craft approximately two hundred feet of the ground;1973-06-15 15:00:00;3.5 minutes;witnessed a disk shaped craft approximately two hundred feet of the ground In the early nineteen seventies on a summer afternoon over the city of Vancouver British Columbia I witnessed a massive disk shaped craft red in color with a dome and four distinct colored lights on its undercarriage. Rotating slowly in a clockwise direction it slowly rose to a hovering position about two hundred feet off the ground, it began rotating faster and faster and began emitting a fiery orange glow from the undercarriage, suddenly it shot straight upwards almost out of sight and returned to an unknown height in the sky. Sitting motionless for a few seconds it suddenly manoeuvred in zig zag motions and made instant right and left turns at rapid velocities, it streaked back and forth across the sky then it rapidly disappeared into the north east mountainous region. Until this event I was skeptical about this controversy but now I can say without question such a technology exists somewhere. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

The sun would have also been in the sky although it was a dull morning). It was a cloudy morning and i would guess the cloud bank to be at 1500-2000 feet. The object was copper coloured and had what appeared to be lines on the underside(?) which formed a thick cross-similar to the nazi iron cross design-there was also a set of lines which went around the outer edge of this thing. This disc also travelled on its rim and climbed into the sky like a wheel. It was not hovering but moving steadily on its rim. I believe i was looking at the underside of the craft and do not know if there was mass or bulk (cabin or infrastructure) on the side i could not see. It was the size of a penny-a canadian or american one cent. i watched it until my head was almost on the dash board trying to see where it was going. Eventually it moved into the cloud bank and out of view. this is a diagram to the best of my memory. The disc was the size of a small coin and the same colour as a one cent piece. http://i27.tinypic.com/ehhso1.gif ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

We were both about 10 ;1998-04-15 14:00:00;5 minutes;Sometime in the spring of 98 a friend called me from a lookout in the afternoon.   He told me to look outside.   We were both about 10 miles from downtown Vancouver and could easily see above and beyond it.   What we both saw was seemed to appear like a classic 'disc' shaped object.   The object appeared to be grey and just seemed to hover over the city.  Although it could have been farther over the water, we couldn't tell.  We watched it for about 5 minutes as it slowly made it's way from south to north.    Then without warning, just seemed to disapear.   To this day we tell people about it and have no doubt in our mind it wasn't a balloon or plane of any kind we've seen before.   Unfortunetly, neither of us had the opportunity to capture the sighting on camera.   Which makes our sighting probably one of thousands you recieve. The 'disc' as mentioned, was grey. It was stationary when we 1st saw it.  Then it slowly moved towards the north until it just disapeared.   The sky was clear that day.  (which is a rarity in Vancouver)  So we know it couldn't have been a plane fading into the clouds. I and the witnesses were just out of high school at that time. If credibility is the reason you ask for a description of backgrounds, sorry, we aren't doctors or scientists. :) I would also like to add that i decided not to release any information about my detailed location due to privacy.  If this was a more prominant sighting/experience combined with physical evidence, i would be more than happy to submit any information requested. :);49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657

UFO sighting Sat Aug 24/02 in Vancouver, Canada;2002-08-24 23:50:00;over 1 hr;UFO sighting Sat Aug 24/02 in Vancouver, Canada Saturday Aug 24/02 at 11:59 PM in Vancouver. My wife recieved a phone call at 11:45 from my brother. She then told me that the meteor I was waiting for can be seen in the sky. I told her it was last saturday. I then saw the object she was talking about west. I told her it was an airplane characteristic of the blue and red flashing lights. She then told me my brother also saw it 18 KM away. I said that was impossible. I decided this requires more research. I hauled out my telescope. Spotted the object at 50 power and noticed it was no airplane. Went to 200 power. I then had a clear picture. It was close to the characteristic flying saucer shape. It glowed very intensely. Had a weird rotating sensor beam on the top part of the saucer. It flashed aqua color first and then orange-red second. Much like a rotating spot beam at a 0.5 second rotation. Obviously one beam that could scan orange-red and then aqua. I then took relative size calculations. Today I took bearing calculations at my place and my at my brothers to figure out the distance to the object. I also took an object that looked the same size in the telescope at a distance that i measured to figure out the size. I went over to my brothers who pointed to where he saw it. I used my GPS to get the bearing at his place. Using math I calculated the object was 30 meter diameter at a distace of 200 KM. That puts it over Vancouver Island. The object also moved much like a star in the sky. This indicates that it could not be an object in close orbit. The object must of been under power. My brother watched it for over an hour and me for 45 minutes before it went behind some trees. I can say this was not weather ballon or object burning up in the atmosphere. I cant say this was a Alien space ship, but if it was not, the Earth has developed a new type of ship that is quite impressive.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
saucer shape, no lights, no wings, extreme speed;2003-08-04 17:00:00;3-5 seconds;saucer shape, no lights, no wings, extreme speed Scroll down to the 4th sighting diagram in your past case history on this web sight. I saw that thing today against a clear blue afternoon sky. Oddly, the only difference is that what I saw was much larger- half the size or less of a 737 jet and the body of the craft was white, not silver as depicted on the website, with a silver area/stripe down the centerline. It accelerated from a speed of about 125-150 mph to several hundred mph horizontally at an altitude of about 2500-3000 ft in less than 1-2 seconds. It did not make a sound. I expected a sonic boom. It was not shiny, had no wings, tail rudder or lights. I realize that my description - white craft with grey/silver centerline pretty much describes an airplane. That's why I did a double take after first seeing it. The color scheme seemed airplane enough...but then the shape of it, the lack of noise/exhaust/contrail/lights and it's speed and sudden acceleration made me do a double take. I've never heard of white being a stealth color either. The sun was at my back and I could see this thing clearly for at least 3-4 seconds before it rocketed out of sight. It was no airplane, chunk of space debris or naturally occurring astronomical phenomena. It maintained level flight at a very high rate of speed and fairly low altitude before I lost sight of it. I had company with me. Unfortunately, they faced the other direction and could only attest to the look on my face in response to seeing this thing.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
From right put of Lost in Space The original.  Rotating multi-colored lights bottom and side, silent low hover, EERIE;2003-10-31 03:00:00;15 minutes;From right put of Lost in Space The original.  Rotating multi-colored lights bottom and side, silent low hover, EERIE I just looked out & up at the clear night sky this morning, when even to my surprise, there it was plain as could be, and right out of Lost in Space - the original. I mean, thats what it looked like to me, lights, red, orange, green, blue, yellow and white. rotating under and around the side, Many more lights than any conventional, night flying, airplanes would have on.  Not real bright though, like christmas tree lights rotating.  No sound, eriely silent, AND moving in more of a hover, almost a slight wobble from too low a speed. It had to be enormous in size, I guestamate, I was 1 - 2 kilometres from it, then it passed behind a building. This would have been visible to anyone outside at 3am, near English bay, Stanley Park area. Its altitude was very low, a few hundred feet I think, over the water at English Bay.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657

Red/green/white/blue flashing lights seen on circular or disk shaped object by couple in vancouver B.C..;2014-09-27 05:25:00;10 minutes;red/green/white/blue flashing lights seen on circular or disk shaped object by couple in vancouver B.c fiance was outside smoking a cigarette, looked up at the stars and noticed an object floating with multi colour lights, at first glance she thought it was a star and then noticed it ws to bright and then started moving from right to left and appeared to becoming closer, first she steadied herself against a wall to ensure it wasnt just her moving and that it was the object moving, then she came inside and got me and i went out with the iphone. once i came outside i noticed a circular object floating with many colours, red blue green and white lights, then it got foggy really fast, faster than usual and we could still see the object because of the brightness and then it dissaperead into the fog or clouds... it seemed like it was unusually high to be fog and wehn i first arrived it was a clear night and you could see the stars.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
I observed UFO through 15x70 binoculars, so close that I could see black dust on the walls of the vehicle.;2016-02-26 00:50:00;1/1 minutes;I observed UFO through 15x70 binoculars, so close that I could see black dust on the walls of the vehicle. I was coming out on the balcony for a cigarette (I do not smoke illicit drugs nor I don't drink alcohol was wearing eye glasses at the time of the event). When I was siting on the chair and looking outside (photo attached) I saw strange looking triangle/grey object.  It didn't have any lights whatsoever and it was slowly moving from right to the left (as on the photo) and (north to south on map).  I knew right away that it is something strange and can not be airplane.  We don't have airplane flying this way, I have never seen one.  And all airplanes, helicopters have flashing light this was as dead piece of ring like round concrete color object in the air. I wear glasses and I had them on during sighting, after seeing that it is something strange I quickly opened the balcony door and grabbed my Celestron 15x70 Binoculas (which I have always ready staying beside the balcony door (I watch birds, eagles, airplanes, etc).    When I got binoculars and looked back it was right on the top of the building and moving slowly south.  It is hard to identify it quickly in binoculars.  That's why I looked at the building first, then up, and I got image sharp exactly at the object.       My knees shaking a little, and I screamed to my wife to come and see.  I probably looked at it 6 seconds, and I just could not believe what I see.  I will describe it here:  As you can imagine first it looked just like something large grey ((?)) in the sky, but after binoculars magnification it was clear as day.  I saw a grey colored like concrete round object.  it was reminding me as a vehicle tire as if you would put it flat on the ground but without center (wedding ring like).  It was grey without any lights or windows. It looked in some places  like it was dirty dark/black dust.  It looked like an old spaceship after entering atmosphere burned in some places.  It definitely looked not as shiny as other people describe. It was grey ,made object with black dust parts all over it.  It felt like this ship went through places for sure.  What was most interesting that it didn't just fly straight left, it was gliding like a rock if you throw it on the top of the lake.  It was gliding on the air and it looked so light not like airplane fly heavy in the sky this object was gliding and I felt that it was crashing. I turned around to call my wife and screamed for her to come over, when I turned back it was gone. In measurements I would say it looked in length of Boeing 777 and round like a ring with a hole in the center. Why I was lucky that it was couple days after full moon and it was still bright and big.  The moon was exactly behind me that moment, so all moon light was going towards this UFO.  I believe only because of this I saw it.  It is easy to see birds flying at night when the get light from the city or the moon on them.       I draw how it looked right away and I took a photo of the view (edited in Photoshop of exact dimensions how it appeared to me on that night). I hope it helps and maybe someone would recognize seeing the same. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone, and he seemed to us to be a quite serious, and sober-minded individual.
