It was a large, white moon size object with a very large emerald green tail. It travelled north to south in the eastern sky very fast. It went across the horizen in less than 1 second. I was looking out the window towards Mars at the time. ( the closest it's been in 60,000 years). I thought it was a very very large meteor.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
Silent blue lightning shoots from the sky;2004-12-18 22:20:00;1 second;Silent blue lightning shoots from the sky It was 10:20 P.M.  the sky was clear, no wind, no rain, just cloudy.  I was outside looking up at the south west sky and the moon's light could be seen shining through the clouds.  then all of a sudden, it appeared that a streak of lightning struck the earth not too far away (not too close either).  I assumed it struck the earth, but there was a small garage obstructing my view of the ground.  The flash of light was blue and looked very similar to lightning, it just seemed to go straight down.  it didn't look like a perfectly straight line either, it was sorta jagged, similar to what lightning would look like.  There was absolutely no sound associated with the blue lightning and the flash was less than 1 second.  It didn't illuminate the sky either.  it was absolutely not a meteor, comet, shooting star, plane, helicopter, mars, pluto or venus.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
