Small black cylinder seen hovering over Vancouver B.C.;2001-08-29 15:30:00;30 minutes;Small black cylinder seen hovering over Vancouver B.C. Was at the Pacific National Exebition with family. The weather was clear and warm with a few wispy clouds. Observed black cylindrical object hovering motionless in a vertical attitude towards the south at approx 15:30 while kids were playing in zero G room. Pointed object out to other family members but they showed little interest. Found this reaction a little bit puzzling since the object was clearly unusual. Attempted to take a picture of it with my digital camera but even at full zoom it only took up one or two horizontal pixels and perhaps four vertical pixels. So I would guess the object was no larger than a mini minor approx 1 mile away and several hundred feet in altitude. Observed object for a good 15 minutes while walking back to the car. It may as well have been a fixed hole in reality because it didn't move even slightly. Before we got back to the car I decided to drive towards the object on the way home in the hope of making an identifiction but for some reason once I started driving I forgot all about it. I didn't think about it again until I had been home for some time so I have no idea when the object departed. Have not seen it again in the 3 and a half years since.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
A black cylider hovered over Vancouver in broad daylight.;2001-08-30 18:00:00;4 mins;A black cylider hovered over Vancouver in broad daylight. It was Thursday. I had just finnished a day of set up for the 'Molson Indy Vancouver'.    I was walking to a friend's place to drop off her work pass and shirt for the Indy weekend, as she lived only eight blocks away. The time was between 5:30pm-6:00pm, as I recall, the day was still bright and sunny. I was heading south on Main street, between 5th ave. and 6th ave., when I noticed to my left a black rectangular shape in the sky.  It had the dimensions of a doorframe although I perceived the object to be cylindrical . Like a piece of black pipe standing on end, the object floated motionless in the eastern sky. It's elevation was about 30 degrees from my vantage point on the street and perhaps 1 km. distant, (maybe 100 meters above ground). I estimated the size of the    object to be about that of a minivan. There was no perceivable sound. There were no surface features. I stood watching as I waited for the crosswalk light. Traffic was busy, as normal, but I saw no one else observing the black minivan in its time-suspended nose-dive. I am 34 years old, I am no fool, and this was unusual. I always try to maintain an acute awareness of my environment, often with suspicion and scrutiny when curcumstances warrant it. I am also a big believer in a universe teaming with life. What spooked me the most about this encounter was that I had completely forgotten what I had seen. Even when passing the same spot on my way home, not ten minutes later, I didn't look to see if it was still there. It wasn't until October 21, when I caught part of a documentary on the 'Space Channel' about U.F.O sightings, did it all come back to me. Similar reports of objects have been photographed and such an image jogged my memory. Apparently an object of the same description hovered motionless over a U.S. town for 3 days.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
