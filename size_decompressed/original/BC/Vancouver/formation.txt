3 dark objects, size undetermined, in formation at extreme speed.;1978-06-30 21:00:00;5 seconds;3 dark objects, size undetermined, in formation at extreme speed dates unknown, late 1970's, summertime. 3 teenagers (1 male/2 female):  my brother and my friend and I were lying out in the backyard, watching for satellites.   Suddenly 3 objects flying in formation crossed over us.  Because it was dark out, and these objects were also dark, it's impossible to say how big they were or how high they were.   They were each identical in size, oblong, what reminded me at the time of the shape of an over-sized rear-view mirror my father had installed on the inside of his car: long and slightly rounded at the edges. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657

Counted 50 moving star-ships in skies over Vancouver BC with some in formation and others moving across sky.;2007-08-22 23:00:00;1 hour;Counted 50 moving star-ships in skies over Vancouver, BC, with some in formation and others moving across sky. Night skies filled with flashing stars so I sat outside with binnoculars looking straight up. All of the so-called stars were flashing lights and the brightest were very active ships moving around extremely fast. There was no mistaking what I was seeing. I have watched like this before but this time I sat for a full hour and stopped counting at 50. I live in North Vancouver and my apt. faces south so I was looking due south, high in the sky.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
4  bluish-white lights flying in fomation at very high altitude;2007-09-11 00:10:00;5 minutes;4  bluish-white lights flying in fomation at very high altitude I went out to my backyard to move the sprinklers to a new position before bed. The sky was perfectly clear and the typical visable stars were crystal clear. As I was returning back to the house, I noticed a moving light in the upper left portion of the sky. As I observed closer, I realized the light was actually four distinct lights not one. Three of the lights were in a triangular pattern and one light was off directly off to the right. They were moving south-west across the sky. The altitude was very high. I intially thought the lights were a single satillite. I have seen numerous satillites over the years and these lights looked nothing like any satillite I have ever seen. The altitude seemed right but the speed seemed faster than a satillite. I realized that these lights were not multiple satillites travelling together or a commercial airlliner. The lights were bluish-white and did not blink. The lights stayed almost equal distances apart without any variations in formation. The lights were definetley seperate entities as i could see the night sky between them. They made no sound. I was able to observe the lights for approxiamatley 6 seconds before they faded from view. I couldn't see any high altitude clouds but figured that may possibly have been the reason I lost view of them. I was in trying to associate the lights to all my past experience with aircraft or satellites to make sense of what I saw. I have never seen anything like these lights before. I'm still mystfied. I don't drink or smoke (anything). I was well rested and not under any stress. I cannot expain what I saw. I find it hard to believe that in the highly populated area of North Burnaby, BC. that I was the only one to witness this.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
Saw 4 helicopters following something in Vancouver, BC.;2014-10-01 15:00:00;1 minute;Saw 4 helicopters following something in Vancouver, BC. Not really sure what I saw happening, but I saw 4 un-marked black helicopters following a craft of some kind.  Didn't look like another helicopter or airplane that the helicopters were chasing or following.  It really struck me as odd.  It was the middle of the afternoon, a clear day. I watched the activity until all of the helicopters disappeared behind a hillside covered with trees.  I was at sea level, so I lost sight of everything.  Could have been nothing, but didn't look normal.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
11 white star like lights blinking/flashing & non-flashing for 40+ minutes in scattered formation, very very slowly moving.;2018-07-15 17:30:00;45 minutes;11 white star like lights blinking/flashing & non-flashing for 40+ minutes in scattered formation, very very slowly moving. I was sitting on the bleachers at a Powwow In North Vancouver watching the Dancers, I was facing the South East.  I saw an eagle flying in the distance across from me, I kept following it with my eyes to see if it was indeed an eagle and it flew almost overhead and as I turned my head I saw behind it in the distance a group of shiny bright objects looking like stars. I counted eleven and they were spread out, and some in between from top to bottom made a sort of curved line.  I wondered if they were stars in some kind of constellation but Iâ€™ve never seen such kind of stars in such daylight before.   So I kept watching for twenty minutes and I noticed some of them slowly moved around, and others were more stationary.  Some were slightly smaller or dimmer than some, a couple were significantly brighter, and some did not blink, but most did. &#8232&#8232  As I kept watching I saw them eventually after about 25 minutes they came very close together and then very very slowly they moved towards the East.  That's when I remembered I had binoculars in my vehicle and I went to look with those. they eventually went to far to see, or disappeared. &#8232  There were a number of aircrafts during the couple hours I was there, Helicopters and sea planes because I was beside the Harbour. But the lights may have been too high for them to easily be noticed.  There were no clouds in the sky and it would sometimes become difficult to spot them again if I walked around and and tried to spot them in the blue sky. I tried taking photos and video but the sun was shining on my cell phone screen making it difficult to see wether I had the lens aimed at the objects.  Got a bunch of blank blue sky photos and video with maybe a tiny blip or two but hard to tell.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
Shimmering unidentified object sighting;2019-11-06 00:00:00;40 minutes;Shimmering unidentified object sighting I woke up at 4:30am to study. I was sitting in the living room that has large scale windows. Around 6am I noticed a weird object in the sky. It was shaped like one of the total utility curves we study in economics but without the decreasing part of the curve. It was shimmering continuously and was in the place for about 40 minutes. It then disappeared.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
Stars moving across sky in formation, at equal distance and speed, following each other for 10 minutes((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-27 20:30:00;10 minutes;Stars moving across sky in formation, at equal distance and speed, following eahother for 10 minutes, dozens of them, one direction. I was walking my dog and looking up at the moon, and from the northwest came a moving satelite. I thought I was looking at stars, until one of them appeared to move, across the sky, overhead, moving South East for like 3 seconds...then followed by another...then followed by another, etc for like a dozen times, all in exact formation, following eachother in a line, like a studded belt. I ran into my place across the street and grabbed my camera, the dog following, curious. I ran back to the site location and the event was still in progress, so a good 2 minutes in duration by then. I attempted photos, but my phone-cam can barely get a shot of the moon it's too weak. So I continued to observe, wondering about it. A passerby walked up and I accosted him to give a look, and we marvelled over the sight of their continuing number, flying in steady formation, about 3 visible at a time, spread over the sky, in a constant line. As soon as one disappeared into the dis! tance, another would appear from whence the other came. The event lasted about 10 minutes, maybe 15, because I also had time to phone my friend and tell him about it, while it occurred. I've been deflowered! Thank you for reading this far.
