6 cigar shaped objects over Vancouver;2004-12-22 16:39:00;2 minutes;6 cigar shaped objects over Vancouver This sighting happened during a sunset with partly cloudy sky (low clouds in 6,000 feet level). The first pair consisted of 3 cigar shaped object were flying in and out of the  the clouds. They seemed to be a little bigger than 747 from that distance. The discribed objects had same size and same shape (this was proven when the picture of one of the objects was moved on top of the other ones which completely covered the other ones). These objects were flying near Vancouver International airport and over south vancouver near UBC. There were two pictures taken one 2 minutes before and another one 2 minutes after the sighting has occured and in none of these pictures there is any object of that sort visible. The next pair are moving over downtown vancouver. they are more like the cigar shaped object sighted in Iraq. After close look, there are some curved lines visible around each object.These lines seem to be related to the propulsion system of the objects. these objects were high above the clouds so there was a good chance for them to be above 6,000 feet. This second group was visible from above 6,000 feet, so they should a significant size.  All the six objects were clearly in some sort of formation and they were going oppossit way, first pair to the south east and the second pair to the north west. There pictures avalible on request. During this sighting, there was no flight show of any kind and the cigar shaped objects were dangarously close to each other flying on top a populated area.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
Time I saw object:  19.04 Hours, September 7th 2005.;2005-09-07 19:04:00;3 Minutes;Time I saw object:  19.04 Hours, September 7th 2005.  I'm one of those unfortunates or fortunes to see many of these things in my life.  I don't always report them to your center but today I will as this one was not a quick 30 second thing - blink of the eye and then it's gone.  I went for a jog in the Point Grey area here in Vancouver, very close the beach, when on my return towards my home, I saw what I thought was a plane, I'm quite observant of the sky.  Then I realized that it wasn't a plane.  Then I thought it looked like a blimp.  A telephone company here in Canada uses one quite frequently here in the Lower Mainland for advertising purposes, but quickly I realized that it was simply too high up in the air for anyone to see it with the writing and logos on it.  Then I thought, oh no, here we go again.  I watched the object for about 3 minutes maybe a bit longer.  It was located in the south sky and the visibility is excellent.  Object appeared to be heading towards to USA and climbing higher upwards.  Colour white.  Solid Object.  Moved slowly.  Not planes in the sky from where I'm stood.  I obviously stopped jogging to gain a beter look at this object and I was simply courious if this passing stranger could see this object as well.  I asked a stranger Do you have good eye sight? and asked her if she could see that object in the sky.  She said yes.  PS.  Last night Sept. 6th 2005, as I was walking home from a video store with my boyfriend, we happened to see a bright light in the north sky get bright and then retract very quickly. We couldn't see any traces or trail of anything like a plane in the general vicinity in the sky such as when a plane may be glarring it's front headlights and then turn, this wasn't quite the same. He was about as puzzled as I was.  Just thought I'd mention last nights oddity in case anyone else in Vancouver, B.C, or North Vancouver saw this bright light.  This light was after night had fell I would estimate the time we saw it to be around 9.30 ish PM.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
Video of strange object floating through the sky above Vancouver.;2020-06-17 10:15:00;6 minutes;Video of strange object floating through the sky above Vancouver. I was outside having my coffee this morning and I noticed a large structure floating slowly upwards. It appeared to resemble the size and shape of a first stage falcon 9 rocket. I video taped the object.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
