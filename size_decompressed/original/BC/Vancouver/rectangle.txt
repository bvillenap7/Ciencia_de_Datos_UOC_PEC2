Small, faint lights that fly above cloud line changing direction and speed.;2012-11-21 19:06:00;2 hours;Small, faint lights that fly above cloud line changing direction and speed. Over the past week, when there is lite cloud coverage, between approx. 6pm to 1 am, myself and two others are witnessing up to 22 small, faint 'lights' in the sky. They seem to come from the East travelling above the cloud line then turn either N.W. or South.  At first we thought they were satellite but soon discovered they would stop then turn direction and speed of at an astronomical rate. There are also what looks like larger ones that are triangle shaped with lights at each corner. They move for the most part North to South then back South to North, pausing for a moment before continuing. A friend set up his son's small telescope the other night yet they are still to far away to see clearly.  With that said, it's almost like the larger ones are ' clocted '.   It's not possible to make out a definite shape due to the clouds and on a clear night they are not around.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
