Orange glowning orb/sky.;1983-06-30 00:00:00;unknown;orange glowning orb/sky early 1980s: my mother knew I was interested in the astronomy and the night sky, so reported what she had seen overnight:  she awoke during the night because the sky as she could see it from her bed was glowing orange.  She got up and looked out the window of the front door and saw a large glowing ball, about the size of the sun, and the entire sky was likewise orange.   She went back to bed!  I asked her why she hadn't awakened me, and she simply said, I don't know, I just went back to bed!   This fits with other reports I've heard from people who say they seem somehow numbed to alerting anyone.  It's like nothing exciting has happened and they just carry on, go back to sleep, whatever.

Point of light moving quickly;2000-01-02 19:30:00;2-3 secs;Point of light moving quickly While looking out 22nd floor window, notice point of light, high above a very tall building. Color was orange/red, twinkling, unusually large. Point of light was travelling what-seemed-to-be north to south. Just to the left of ORION, (if that helps...). It was inside our atmosphere..that I know!! After one sec of spotting it...it decended at a very high rate for approx 1.5 secs at downward slope. Point of light blinked out, before it moved behind the building. The building DID NOT block the light blinking out...it went out before it passed behind the building..my husband...sits in his office...like you I'm sure..in front of his computer EVERYDAY...his window looks east. He is very aware of the light patterens that blink in the night, on an everyday basis. He claims he saw a point of light, 45 min prior in a totally different place, matching the same description. This orange/red twinkling point of light, was unusualy large, to be suspended in mid air for 4-5 sec's. It was something he claims he has NEVER seen before in differentiation to fixed winged aircraft and helicopters flying in the vicinity. He says you mentioned something about a fireball. He says....SORRY...NO FIREBALL...FIREBALLS dont hover for 4-5 sec's..then just blink out....or maybe they do...who knows. This is our report.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
Bright light hovering low between Vancouver, BC and US Border;2000-06-16 22:10:00;10+ minute;Bright light hovering low between Vancouver, BC and US Border My husband and I were returning home south from Vancouver, BC on Hwy. 99 towards the US border.  The weather was clear and warm, and the sun had just set.  As we were driving past the Mud Bay area north of White Rock, I gazed out the passenger side window and saw a bright light in the sky to the southwest.  At first I thought it was a plane on approach to Vancouver International Airport, or maybe a very bright star.  However, as we got closer and I watched it the object appeared to be immobile, and was closer than I had at first thought.  It was a bright, white light and was hovering over the bay, between where we were driving and the Pt. Roberts area.  I am not good at estimating height but I would say it was no higher than 1,500-2000 feet off the ground.  The light reflected into the bay.  I strained to look for any other lights that would indicate it was an airplane or helicopter, but it simply was a very bright ball of light.  It looked like a very bright star, just very low and very close.  After I had decided it wasn't an airplane or helicopter I pointed it out to my husband.  He was driving so couldn't examine it closely, but we both observed it hovering silently for at least 10 minutes until we had passed it.  We could still see it in the rear view mirror until a hill obstructed its view.  We wanted to investigate further but were late getting home to the babysitter.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
Over a hundred UFO's flying the skys of Cancun, Mexico.;2001-04-03 02:00:00;1.5 hours;Over a hundred UFO's flying the skys of Cancun, Mexico. I was in Cancun, Mexico. Partying with my friends at Daddy Rocks (nightclub). I went to get some fresh air up on the top floor outdoor deck. I see about 30 spectators (including 3 security doormen) lookin' to the sky, claping and screaming in joy. I look up and see, what seems to be flying stars. I instantly know there not stars becuase the way they are moving. There where lots (probably around a hundred all together). I would see some moving as a group (like 5 or 6) ,but not in Unisen, all where traveling at there own speed and direction. they would fly in one direction then pause in one spot then dart off in the oppisite direction. They would fly up then down and zig zag across the sky. I seen some fly in real close to each other, pause next to each other, then dart of in different directions. There was huge lights at this club that shot up in the sky (around 8 lights formed in a circle) that would go left to right, right to left. When these lights went to the right hand side of the sky (where most of the UFO's where) the UFO's would get brighter and more active (almost like it was putting on a show for us). At one point about 8-10? UFO's joined in what seemed a sloppy circle in the sky, paused for a brief couple seconds, then they all darted off in there own direction. (kind of like a childs drawing of the sun. They took off like the lines around the circle). I seen a few that seemed like they where goin so fast towards each other like they where goin to crash, but they went right by each other (real close). After about a half hour of seeing this, I went into the club and tried gettin all my friends to come out and see what I seen, there first reaction was that I was high or drunk and was seeing things, after getting up on the deck though they relized I wasn't seeing things. They too seen what appeared to be UFO's. We starred at the sky for about another hour till we finally left (it was still going on when we left, but I noticed there were less of them and where slightly dimmer).I just wish I broug! ht my vi deo camera. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and we found him to be seemingly sober-minded.  We have requested reports from anyone else who apparently witnessed these objects.

3 lights travelling very fast with the 2 on the side keeping very haphazzard courses;2001-05-02 00:02:00;30 seconds;3 lights travelling very fast with the 2 on the side keeping very haphazzard courses I was looking out my bedroom window just after midnight and noticed 3 odd lights in the sky. I live very close to the Vancouver airport and have seen hundreds of aircraft (commercial and military) in the last couple years. This aircraft(s) was bizzare. It was as if there was one leader light that kept a very straight course. There was one light on the left and one on the right side that kept very haphazzard courses, swirling around the middle light, but never crossing in front or behind it. The lights seemed fairly high, but were uncommonly bright for that height. Judging from what I assumed its height was, the velocity made it clear it was not a commercial aircraft, and even passed a military plane's speed. I saw three lights, but was unable to tell if there were three separate crafts. The reason for posting this sighting now instead of last year, is because I just read on www.ufobc.ca of someone else seeing a similar craft at almost the same time.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657

Looked like a helicoptor spot light then hovered and zoomed away very fast, approximately .5km up in the sky not moving.

Aproximately 8:58 am this morning (thursday, May 16 2002) i was having breakfast at a cafe down by the beach and i looked up and saw a white light very high in the sky.  it was a clear day not a cloud in sight.  the object moved slowly at first. it moved in an eliptical pattern..  It seemed to slow down at one point and then stop for three or four seconds. then it sped up again and continued along its circular path going back the way it came.  it disapeared behind a building and i never saw it again. the entire event may have taken up to two mintues. There was only one object.  It didn't appear shiney. just white.. and very very high in the sky.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  I saw a single blue light traveling very slow towards the east;2003-06-16 23:05:00;12 seconds;I think I saw a UFO over Vancouver city on June 16th at 11:05 p.m. I came home from work and was closing my blinds on my window that faces North and I saw a single blue light traveling very slow towards the east. Then it got slower and slower, almost a complete stop, that's when I opened my window to see if I could hear any sound and I couldn't. Then it flashed a big bright white, yellowish light and made a sharp left turn and moved faster towards the North, the light fading as it moved. I lost sight of it over the high buildings in the downtown area. Do you know of any aircraft that has this kind of lighting and can move like that? I would appreciate any information that you might have. Thanks  Addition Information  I should tell you that I first spotted it when I was in a taxi cab on my way home from work.  I just glance up and saw this blue light and before I could take a better look we took a turn and It was above us so the roof of the cab blocked the view. It was just above Granville bridge as high as a small plane that's why I took it to be a plane and didn't think about again until I came home and saw it again through my window and it was moving from the west going towards the east.  2. I remember really taking a good look at this light moving and trying to make out any shape against the dark sky and thought that I did see something besides this light like a shape but couldn't make it out and it also seemed to have a very tiny faint light in front of the blue light but I'm not sure about that  I would say I watched it for about 7 seconds before it turned bright and turned, then another 5 seconds watching it fade and move towards the North.  3. Yes I would say pea size when blue but it expanded when it flashed bright and at that time it would be dime size and then back to pea size when it move away.  4. Altitude would be the same as a small plane. The same altitude of the planes when the Symphony of fireworks are here. Ten thousand feet?  5.  No one else was with me in my apartment at the time and when I was in the cab I didn't ask the cab driver to look because he was driving and I thought it was a plane. Surely someone else in the downtown area saw it too. People on their balconies facing it would see it but would they say report it? I don't know.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Witnessed a bright white light acting very strangely.;2003-09-25 20:15:00;2 seconds;A gentleman called me to report that he witnessed a bright white light acting very strangely. Although the sighting only lasted for a split second or so, he was still able to observe the light doing some very unusual things. The location for this sighting was at around Kitsilano at 4th Avenue and Maple. The witness was walking west on forth Avenue on the north side of the street when he just happened to looked up and caught sight of what looked like a star, white in color. The fellow did not want to make any assumptions, but he thought it may have been reflected sunlight. The object was rather high up in the sky. The light was traveling from north to the south and the sighting lasted approx: a second. He also mentioned that whatever it was moved incredibly fast, like a shooting star. But the unusual thing about it, the light moved very erratic. In other words the witness said it did not move in a straight line. He also mentioned if the light had of traveled in a straight line, he would not have called me to make the report. Only because it behaved so strange, he thought he would file a report. The man felt that the sighting was so strange, he wanted to know if anyone had reported seeing this.  Also, if one looks at the last report I just posted for around the Vancouver area, there are some similarities and a day a part. Any connection, who knows but I think it is still worth noting. No sound was heard. Again his impression was that the light was very high up. Due to him being around a lot of large buildings in the area, he did not have a good field of view.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Red light falling vertically.;2003-10-19 23:30:00;3 seconds;Red light falling vertically. Hi,  I am reporting seeing a strange big reddish ball of light which appeared to fall from the sky.  I live downtown Vancouver on the 25th floor facing North East.  The light seemed to be over the airport.  At first I thought it was a plane but after watching it, it was much larger than a plane light and was falling vertically.  I was waiting for some type of explosion but it just disappeared into the horizon, like it fell off the edge of the Earth so to speak.  Weird  I saw this happen at approx. 11:30 PM on October 19/2003.  As it appeared to be over the airport I think it must of been much farther as it seemed to disappear just to the right of  where Mount Baker is in the horizon.

This Object was no sattellite!;2003-10-29 00:34:00;seconds;This Object was no sattellite! Between 12:30am and 12:45am on oct 29/03 were out side watching the northern lights when on object adpeared out of no where.  First, instinct was that it was a satellite, but never saw one move as fast as this object was travelling, more than twice the speed.  But what really caught our attention was the way it travelled, we were looking south westwardly and the object came in from the north in an arc like tangent.  The object then stops,does a counter clockwies circle[with arms out streched about the size of one's thumb and index finger would make] then makes a counter clockwise return,pauses slightly then takes right off out of sight.  The object apeared to be white in colour,there was no sound or any other annomillies.  The whole event took a matter of seconds,we were all shocked at what had just happend.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657

I always hope to see something more and I did.  Tonight I saw 3 different objects all within 5 minutes of one another. The first moved across the sky and looked to be weaving through stars. The next was a object that flashed only a few times and then disappeared. the 3rd was like the first, Just moving across the sky at a fairly good speed. Like, if I held my hand out above my head, stretched out, it would have gone the distance between my two outstretched hands in about 15 seconds. That's it.  Take care. you're doing great work Brian!

Two star sized objects moving in syncro, one dissapearingupward followed by the second.;2006-03-12 21:55:00;30 seconds;Two star sized objects moving in syncro, one dissapearingupward followed by the second. just coming back from shopping and i noticed two lights in the sky that were the same approximate size as big dipper's stars. I called my girlfriend to see it.They were adjacent to the two stars an the big dippers handle and slightly smaller distance apart. they moved in one direction parallel to the handle quite slowly (about the same speed as one might see in a high moving plane). They were too high to have been a plane as well as not hering any noise associated with them. I work with helicopters quite frequently so am sure it was not a sighting of this nature.  As they move in the same direction the first slight began to fade as if it was drwing upward and the second followed shortly after. It was a totally clear night and know that it was not a couple of planes or other objects that i could explain.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657

I was looking up at a clear night sky from my deck when I noticed a very bright light in the northern part of the sky. I thought at first it was an airplane light and the airplane would have been very low and close but there was no sound. The light was bright and intense for about 5-10 seconds and then it dimmed...not out but dimmed. The light then proceeded eastward into the sky. I was watching the trajectory carefully as a plane would have disappeared along the horizon at about a 3 or 4 oclock heading but this light moved at a much higher level 1 or 2 oclock heading. The light just faded into the clear sky.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657

It continued to move for another half second. Then it stopped.  Then in grew in intensity and simply disappeared.  I waited for it to come back, thinking it went behind a cloud.  No clouds.  Lots of stars, but no clouds.  It was the about the size of the brighest star in the sky, at about 45 degree angle.  I held my hand up to just the distance it travelled, about 5 finger widths to the right of what appeared to be venus, (star had a tinge of redish to it).;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657

I would be surprised if no one else saw it because there were 300,000 people on the beach last night (July 24, 2010) for the fireworks but around 9:00 PM while sitting at Kits beach we saw two lights (almost like slivers) in the Northern sky.  One faded out and came in at a different location, while the one sat there for sometime before moving to our right and disappearing behind the mountains.  The one was visible for at least 10 minutes.  We asked the people next to us to check it out and we all scratched our heads as to what could sit there above the mountains and then move so gradually out of site.  Not sure if you have heard anything else on this siting, the fact it was still light out may have prevented it from being seen by most people.  Brent;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657

Bright Orange object random movements then fades or disappears;2011-02-18 20:30:00;5 min;Bright Orange object random movements then fades or disappears I was two blocks east of 18th Ave and Cambie St in Vancouver.  I was going to my truck to get my jacket and looked west up in the sky (something I'm always doing I think in this case though I was looking up to see what the weather was like)  It was clear skies for the most part. My gf's street is has a lot of trees on it so the spot i looked up was really one of the few openings I could see from where my truck was parked.  I could see planes flying off in the distance, but something different caught my attention. There was a bright Orange object in the sky.  I would say a little larger and a little brighter than what a planet looks like in the sky only this was Orange in color.  It seemed pretty far away, i would say at least a few miles.  That's what stuck out initially. I told my gf to look at it (she is very skeptical about this type of stuff) while I grabbed my jacket quick.  She even made some comments that it didn't look like a plane or anything (you could see another plane north west of it with marker lights and everything). I stood there for another minute and watched it move.  The orange object made kind of a clockwise circular movement and then at the 6oclock position it started to move in a straight line and then stopped.  We now began to walk west towards Cambie St hoping to get a better vantage point. I was even tripping a few times on the sidewalk as I was glued to the sky. Once we got a better view I stopped because it started to get dimmer.   My view was framed to the left by! a large tree, the bottom by a house, and to the right was a smaller tree.   The orange object was located i would say about a 45o angle of elevation.  As it was fading (slowly) it wasn't moving it only flickered a few times.  I paid attention to the fact that it wasn't moving over anything on the horizon.   And then just like that it was gone.  And I went on with my night.  The sighting was really fast, I only had my cell phone and don't think it would have showed that well. I think my drawings will better represent what we saw. My gf can verify everything we saw from the movement, it's brightness, and it fading to nothing while not moving.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657

Looked and moved like a satellite, but disappeared.;2013-08-19 21:30:00;1 minute;looked and moved like a satellite, but disappeared Aug 19 2013 (I believe, might have been the 26th, but it was a Tuesday), exact time unknown.    I was watching for shooting stars or satellites when I saw what I thought was a satellite by the way it was moving.  It wasn't cloudy out, but the sky was ever so slightly overcast so that there was a  glow visible the moon, and many stars were still visible in spite of the slight cloud.  I watched this object move from the south, upward through the sky (northward) and it approached/disappeared in  the glow of the moon.  I waited and watched and counted to see when it would proceed from the other side, but it never reappeared.  It was the comparable size of a satellite and moved in the same way (slowly and in only one direction while I was watching it).;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
Bright green streak across cloudy night sky in Vancouver.;2014-08-29 20:00:00;2 seconds;Bright green streak across cloudy night sky in Vancouver On a rooftop of an appartment building in East Vancouver, BC, at around 10 pm, my girlfriend notices a few flashes of what seemed like lightning above our heads, lit up the sky for very short periods.   Later is what we both saw when we were sitting down facing the South.  In the the sky to the south of our location we saw a bright green light soar across the sky.  Heading from east to west, I would saw around 40 degrees from the horizon.  Faster than a plane or satelite it flew for what looked like a maybe a hundred KM and then got brighter and disappeared.  It must have been a least 100 kilometers from our location.   After it had vanished, there were a number of planes flying around in a similar location as the UFO.  The sky was cloudy and we could not see and stars which lead me to the conclusion that it was not a shooting star.   As it always is in larger metropolitan areas, we can only see a couple of brighter stars in the sky only on clear nights.   It was a very strange experience and I am very curious if any other people saw it other than us.   Both our descriptions of the event matched each other perfectly.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657

PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, Yes, that was Sirius. I hadn't seen it change colours like that before.  Regards,  ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
a small bright orange star;2020-09-20 22:00:00;1 hour;a small bright orange star We saw a very sharp orange light to the east of Vancouver, quite high. Mabey over Couq. it was hard to judge the distance and height because I don't know how big it was. I looked through the spy glass and just saw a sharper light.  It stayed in one spot for at least 45m that's when I went to sleep at 22.45hrs. There was no twinkle or any movement of any sort, just hung there. I see these all the time.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
