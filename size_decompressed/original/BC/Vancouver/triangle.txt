1994 Sighting in Vancouver, B.C.;1994-02-15 21:00:00;2 minutes;1994 Sighting in Vancouver, B.C. One evening, I was letting our puppy out ((deleted)) before going to bed.  I was outside monitoring him ((deleted)) and I happen to glance up in the sky to check out the weather.  It was a clear night and going over the house, at a moderate speed was a HUGE triangular shaped object.  It was going in a North Westerly direction.  I knew it was a triangle as it had three white lights on each of the three points.  At the base of triangle (in the middle) there were two red lights.  The lights did not flash nor blink and were on constantly.  No other features could be seen.  What was interesting about this vehicle, along with the massive size, was the fact that as it flew over the house, it did not make any kind of noise at all.  As I observed the craft going overhead, I looked around the sky and noticed off to the South West a small plane flying in a North Easterly direction.  I am not sure how far the plane was away but I could hear its engine running.  I could also make out the flashing strobe on the small plane as well as the red and green port and starboard lights.  The next morning, I told my wife (she was working nights on the night in question and wasnt home and I also told our neighbors who lived in the upper part of the house...they too were not home at the time otherwise I would have called them out to witness themselves).  A couple of years later, I was watching the television show Unsolved Mysteries on NBC and they ran a segment on some sightings in Vancouver...a local radio talk show host had seen some strange flying objects in the sky and had mentioned it the next day on his show - he received quite a few calls into his show from other witnesses. I remember commenting with a great deal of excitement to my wife that I was certain that that was the same sighting I had seen though I couldnt remember the specific dates.  I have told numerous people over the years and most are interested in the sighting. No one has ever been critical or made fun of my story...I think that bodes positively for my reputation. I have thought often about filing an official report but didnt know where and eventually, I considered the time lag too much to report.  While still living at the address where the sighting was, I used to watch large airliners go overhead...they could clearly be heard and were substantially smaller then what I saw flying overhead.  To this day, if I hear an airliner flying overhead (if the weather is clear) I will have a look I always think back to the sighting and marvel at the difference in sizes.  I dont want my personal information to be released - thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
3 boomerang shaped lights moving sighlently across the night sky in a triangular formation.;2000-06-15 01:00:00;3 seconds;3 boomerang shaped lights moving sighlently across the night sky in a triangular formation. We were standing on our balcony, 3rd floor south facing. Downtown Vancouver, night time.there were 3 bommerang shaped lights in a triangular formation.  It/they flew straight across the sky, very smooth and what seemed to be fairly fast.  I couldn't say how high it was, but it was higher than a 20 story building, because it was behind the building out of view for a second. that's all I saw.  I didn't make a sound.

The photos are ambiguous, we feel, and the object could be a speck of fiber on the negative.  We are uncertain as to the nature of the object, but we see no convincing evidence that other, smaller objects are being ejected from the larger object.

Triangle spoted high up from a park at 2:00 am pacific.;2002-07-20 02:00:00;25-30 minutes;Triangle spoted high up from a park at 2:00 am pacific. Just a little over a week ago I was walking home from work. It was about 2am and I decided to sit out in a large park overlooking a large part of east vancouver. Looking above stargazing/finishing a can of sprite i noticed 4 stars moving in formation. After a closer look I noticed the outline of a triagle shaped craft. It had 3 brighter lights on the points of the triangle and one dull blue light in the centre. I did believe this to be an airplane or I was just plain going nuts. It lasted for nearly half an hour until i saw the lights spin in an almost 180 degree turn. I nearly had a heart attack and got up about to run while looking at the object. But as soon as I got up there was a quick blur and there wasn't anythinge left to see. And last but not least my cell phone no longer works after that night.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
3 lighted triangular craft (Very silent);2003-02-12 21:02:00;3 minutes;3 lighted triangular craft (Very silent) First of all let me say that I am a harsh skeptic of aliens and all that stuff. This experience changed all that. I live in downtown vancouver in a highrise on the 16th floor. I was just about to tune on to the simpsons(that's how I know the exact time) when i saw this flying object over the the buildings in front of us. At first I thought that it was just the light of one of the cranes on the construction areas. I knew it could'nt be a plane because first of all planes arent supposed to be that close to the city and after watching the planes that go around here everyday I ve almost memorized their paths. second of all the lights in this craft werent flickering or blinking or anything they were just constantly beaming a hazy sort of wierd whitish/yellowish light. I kept looking at it for a while and thought what the hell could that be could it be a blimp? At first I didn't see the 3 lights on the corners of this triangular craft until it very very slowly and I stress SILENTLY without the smallest sound just hovered towards my building. I mean anything made by man that flys only 500 meters away has to make a sound. by now I had called my brother cause I thought my eyes were fooling me. As the craft got closer we realized that it was no plane but some sort of triangular craft because it passed exactly a couple stories over my building and we were looking at the bottom of the craft and saw it's structure and there was a red light in the middle of it (the sterotypical red light, I know) I was just astonished and ran for my camera I kep searching for the damn thing in my messy house and eventually found it and took one lousy picture which I have no idea on how it will turn out. My brother is my witness and all those who know me know how much of a skeptic  and disbeliever I am. I then ran downstairs yelling that there's a UFO outside and nobody believed me i ran and saw the craft. suddenly instead  of going on it's horizontal path it went vertically straght to the skies and turned into a star and stayed their for a while and then left. Some other people saw this downstairs and they didn't care they said it's no big deal probably some governmental plane. But what would a governmental plane be doing in downtown vancouver?;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
green/blue and red lights, object was moving extremely fast and sporadic. (dipping and left to right);2003-04-30 02:30:00;1 hour;green/blue and red lights, object was moving extremely fast and sporadic. (dipping and left to right) this morning (April,30/03)at approx 2:30am I observed a very peculiar light in the sky. It was to the south and at first was about 40 degrees up. At first glance it looked like a star but it looked to be changing colours from a green/blue to red.(similar to a jetliner's lights) At this point I assumed it was a planet. Then I noticed that it was moving in a sporadic fashion (dipping and moving right and left) something I've never seen. I thought I was hallucinating so I woke up my girlfriend who also observed it's bizarre movements in the sky. The speed it was moving was tremendous as it dipped and moved left to right. We watched it for about 40 minutes and then it started dimming until it was gone. Oddly enough this is the 2nd time in 3 months that I've seen the exact same thing. The first time I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me so the 2nd time I awoke my girlfriend so that I knew I wasn't going crazy.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
Black triangular craft with green/red lights flying high over lake christmas night.;2003-12-25 18:30:00;1-3 minutes;Black triangular craft with green/red lights flying high over lake christmas night. It was Christmas night, after 6 pm.  I live by a small lake, trout lake, it's not an isolated area, it is actually situated beside some busy roads.  I was sitting in my garage waiting for my car to warm up.  In the distance, above the horizon/buildings, a very bright white light appeared, the bright white light seemed to be rising very very slowly, or maybe it was moving forward north, towards my area.  This light looked like a really really big star, or a helicopter search light, or a car headlight in the sky.  I assumed it was a plane or helicopter at first, then it was apparent that it was travelling north.  as the object was above the small lake, i could now see the underside of the craft and I am positive that It was triangular in appearance, black/stealth in colour.  the lights that i remember seeing are red/greens, there might have been blue.  at this point, the craft had been travelling in a straight line, but after it had passed the lake and was almost straight above me, it veered left (east) and I am positive that a regular passenger plane would not act in this manner.  I chased the object a few blocks and the triangular nature was evident still.  the object was now hidden behind trees and i gave up the chase.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
Triangle of dim star-like lights on object(s) travelling silently at high speed NNE to SSW in Vancouver,BC.;2005-09-23 23:40:00;10 seconds;Triangle of dim star-like lights on object(s) travelling silently at high speed NNE to SSW in Vancouver,BC. Looking north from Fraser St. & 57th(49deg 13'06N 123deg 05'28W)I saw (against a clear sky) a patch of light approaching my position. It approached rapidly directly overhead and then continued by heading toward the east end of the Vancouver airport. It flew by so quickly that all I could see was a triangle composed of about 5 or more dim (average star brightness) bluish-white lights around its edge. I saw nothing other than lights. The apparent size was about like a 747 (judged by watching its apparent speed and angle receeding toward the airport). There was no sound at all. I estimated its altitude at 1000'. After it flew over the airport approach path it became too dim to see, then a plane (landing) flew a few hundred feet below it 10 seconds later. I think it's important to consider the source of info so I should point out that I majored in sciences through college, and and not prone to fantasy (unless this is my first?).;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
triangle objects hoovered  an hour,flashing red, blue sometimes green lights, then it gradually moved. ((NUFORC Note:  Star??));2006-04-04 20:23:00;2 hrs;triangle objects hoovered  an hour,flashing red, blue sometimes green lights, then it gradually moved with sudden dissapearance My 11 year old son called me outside to show me an unusually bright object in sky.  He got out his telescope and was able to determine that it was a triangle object hoovering in the sky with red pulsing lights and the blue flashed about every minuet. There appeared to be orange light.  It stayed in the same position over a tree for about an hour and then gradually moved to the right for around 10 minuets.  It stayed in this position and then gradually moved to the right taking about 20 minuets and then it suddenly dissapeared. There were about 4 other craft or object like this in the sky to the right of the above describe event, but they were further away.  However through the telescope we could see the same flashing lights. This was witnessed by myself, my 11year old ,my 7 year old and my neighbor.

Nightly sighting-Transl. Green Crafts/Dark Shadow Crafts;2013-04-03 00:00:00;nightly;Nightly sighting-Transl. Green Crafts/Dark Shadow Crafts I must stress the amount of activity over Vancouver's lower mainland and I am baffled no one appears to have made any reports supporting mine. Please allow me to elaborate I noticed pin-points of light traveling quickly in the night sky before last Christmas. They would stop then change direction so I knew they were not satellites. Soon after I noticed, and the only way to describe them is, triangle shaped craft's outlined by translucent, deep green lights. And not one or two but many. They are hard to see due to the colour temperature and easier to notice when it's overcast because the translucent deep green colour seems enhanced by the clouds.As well I've noticed what appear to be dark square shadows in both the day and night sky. Both of these crafts appear to do the same thing line up, fly a circular pattern then repeat it over and over almost as if they were repairing something (?) At 11pm PST and 1am PST I notice, again this the only way I can describe it, all of the translucent deep green outlined crafts standing still and omitting what appears to be a wide spread green 'laser' similar to a rock concert laser light show. Synchronized, each craft's fan of beams pans left to right for approx. 2 minutes projecting a 'mesh' over the night sky. I spotted a dark shadow that hovered over a neighbors house for a number of night last January and shawn a green laser pointer at it. It slowly moved towards me and for 15 seconds hovered in front of me no more than 60 feet away. It resembled a pulsating eye, like a rain drop hitting a puddle, then moved off. It wasn't frightening and seemed as curious of me as I of it. Like I said, I noticed this before last November. I see these every night and think it would be more worrisome if they disappeared. I have video to show you and after reporting to local groups still absolutely no one ever gets back to me.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
7 or 8 dark shadows with green lights outlining a triangle;2013-07-25 23:15:00;Contin.;7 or 8 dark shadows with green lights outlining a triangle 7 or 8 dark shadow crafts with faint green lights outlining a triangle. It were hard to see at first but when we noticed one it was easy to see the other ones.  They appeared to be heading from the East to West park of Vancouver and fly a figure eight pattern.  They would repeat the pattern time and time again then fly back east and replaced by another set.  My neighbour tells me he has been watching them since December, 2012.  After about 8 minutes we noticed they would all stand still and project a fan like laser that fanned right to left for 2 minutes then continue flying their pattern.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
Craft hoovering in one spot for a couple hours.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a star or a planet, possibly Venus.

For the past 3 mornings, approximately 5 am, in the eastern sky I noticed a very bright â€˜starâ€™ in the sky.  It has the shape of an upside down V with a line going down from the middle of the point.  When you first look at it â€“ it looks like a plane.  Sometimes the 'tail' part will flash red.  But the object does not move.  It seems to just hoover in that one area.  It disappears once it gets light outside.  What is it?;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
