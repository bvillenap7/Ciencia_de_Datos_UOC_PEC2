There was a green glowing patch of object that was in the sky.  The object was slightly oblong in shape and the size was hard to determine but possibly about the relative apparent area of 20 stars ( as it was the only thing I can compare it to). there was only 1 of these object. the object remained stationary for the sighting. i believe that it was a UFO sighting contrary to search lights because vancouver search lights are not green, it was emitting green light that was not uniform within the surface seen, the green light was slightly covered by clouds as they moved by and then revealed again. there appeared to be a slight cloudy area around the object. to further describe the green light, the light quality had noise and the light was similar to that seen in LCD/LED clocks and watches.  the object observed was slightly towards the southwest direction from where i was standing and this would've been towards the juan de fuca straight. i did not watch until it left my sight.  but when i put my head down and looked up again,  its position has moved in relation to the stars, further south. the neighbouring stars were quite bright but unfortunately i was not able to identify them.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
