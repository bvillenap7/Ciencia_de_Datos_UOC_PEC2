translucent 12 inch balls of light that are sentient beings with a mission on our little sphere.;1969-11-15 06:00:00;7 hours;translucent 12 inch balls of light that are sentient beings with a mission on our little sphere. 5 quarter - inch bright white lights in a pentagon formation the size of a tennis ball came right through the wall...hovered then slowly separated growing in size until the diameter of a soccer ball...each one was a different pastel colour on the outside layer...you could see through them... the centre of each was the original light but was flickering and emitting tiny faint sparks out to the surface 360 degrees  they would come up to us to within a few feet of our faces but would zip away if we tried to touch them... there was no verbal communication but hours of mental video...past...present...future...from orbs that are light-energy beings...what happened to the three of us was real and surely there are others who have seen and met their makers...tell me I`m not alone bzzzzt.

Wierd shape in the middle of the picture.;2002-01-22 16:08:00;still image;Wierd shape in the middle of the picture. I took a still image using a demo security camera and a capture card. I did not notice this odd shape in the middle of the picture until about a month later. I believe in ufo's but have never seen one. I swear this is authentic and I would just like to have a professional opinion. This picture is of the port of Vancouver from my office where we specialize in the import, sale, and assembly of Digital Video Recorders, video capture cards, and CCtv cameras. The equipment used was a CC-51 camera with a 4.5-10mm auto iris lens and a PV-04 video capture card. Let me know what you think. ((NUFORC Note:  We have viewed the image, which appears quite indistinct.  It is little more than a dark blob in the photo.  We do not know what the object is.

Disc or spherical object moves over activity occurring on roof of tall building appears to observe activity.;2016-04-16 18:00:00;3-5 minutes;Disc or spherical object moves over activity occurring on roof of tall building appears to observe activity. April 16, 2016, between 5:45pm and 6:15 pm Vancouver, Canada, at the Queen Elizabeth Theater. I was sitting in front of the Queen Elizabeth Theater on Hamilton Street facing SW.  You can actually see the exact location I was sitting at and the building I'm going to reference by typing in the following url (google maps):  https://www.google.com/maps/@49.2802229,-123.1138337,3a,75y,134.77h,89.03t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1stq4hKv_aL179G_0htw5Qcg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1   This url will bring you to the exact location and you will be facing the same direction I was and seeing what I was seeing. I was sitting right there on the benches in front of the plaza and the building I'll be referencing is the tallest building on the left in the distance.  The large building on the left in front adjacent to the plaza is the Queen Elizabeth Theater. I had arrived early to an event and so I was just sitting there looking at the city when a man on the very top of the distant building on the left caught my eye.  He was wandering along the edge of the building looking over it.  I became very alarmed thinking that he was going to jump off the building.  I was very intent on watching him when way up high to the right (up from the flag poles) a dark disc or sphere shaped object caught my eye.  It just appeared beneath the clouds. It began moving toward the man on the roof, and as it approached him, I could tell that it was moving closer in our direction (later I determined it was heading NE).  It came over the top of the man and for a moment I thought I was going to witness an abduction, it just stopped and hung there, as though observing him. It was much higher than the man and he didn't seem to notice it as he was looking down over the edge.  Another man appeared and the two of the men began talking, as they turned to walk in the other direction, away from the edge, one of the men pointed to the sky, and both of them momentarily seemed to be looking at the same object I was.  They then proceeded to walk out of view (away from the edge) and the object then moved back in the same direction it had come from and disappeared into the clouds. It was very windy that evening, at least up high, as birds were taking advantage of the winds and sailing at high speeds across my view.  The disc shaped object made no sound, wasn't effected by the wind, it traveled in a general north easterly direction, came to a complete stop, waited about 60 seconds, and then traveled back the way it had come and disappeared into the clouds. Meanwhile, I had my cell phone and could have videoed the whole thing,  I even thought about videoing it but thought it was so far away it would be too hard to capture on a cell phone video. In hind sight, I could kick myself now, it would have probably been a very interesting video. The weather data for that day and time was:  Wind velocity:  9mph.  Wind direction:  from 280 degrees west to east.  Visibility:  20 miles.  Humidity:  82%,  Temp.:  54 Â°F.  Barometer:  30.31 Hg.

2 bright lights seen high in the sky that changed into a dark large sphere and decsending.  ((anonymous report));2017-10-31 21:00:00;5-7 minutes;2 bright lights seen high in the sky that changed into a dark large sphere and decsending after pointing a laser at them. Dear Peter, this is the strangest UFO? incident I have ever encountered.  I saw what I thought was a star in the northern sky,  I may have seen the same thing a few days earlier but I thought it was just a bright star.  This time I took a look at it with a Nikon 9x25 binocular and saw that it was not a helicopter and also not a star, it was a sphere with the brightest light coming from its center but it did not radiate out.  Not knowing now what it was I took my 10 W. 450nm laser and pointed it at this strange object, I noticed that it started to get dimmer, I took the binoculars again and noticed how the light became dimmer as if it was being sucked back in towards the center and then it went out completely and the whole thing changed into a quite large dark ball of something and started to descend quite rapidly in a straight line towards the ground.  I heard no sound, since I have not heard anything falling on to some bodies roof or something,  I assume it may have fallen into the ocean-inlet between, East-Vancouver and North-Vancouver.  Shortly there after, the whole thing repeated itself, a new star-like object appeared at the very same location and for some strange reason, I did the same thing again, and the same thing happened and the dark ball thing fell down at the exact same place because I could see it through the almost leaf less tree across the street.
