One airliner sized teardrop object, hovering vertically near city.;2019-08-13 20:15:00;00:20;One airliner sized teardrop object, hovering vertically near city. I am watching skies from my balcony quiet often. I know the regular routes of the helicopters, seaplanes and the airline jets. Sometimes when I see something out of ordinary,  in order to confirm I grab my 15x70 skymaster binoculars in order to confirm the object. That evening was good weather, it was calm, no wind,  no clouds.  When I see the object first, it was slowly moving East (left to right on my photos) then it slowdown completely and just stayed on one place for about 20 min. I can tell for sure, 100% it is nothing from this world.  It wasn't a helicopter as it looked vertical.  When I looked through the binoculars I couldn't believe what I am seeing.  It was long elongated object with a  size of the mid size passenger jet.  The object was vertically suspended in the air.  I am pretty sure of its size being larger then sesna planes and helicopters.  I've seen balloons flying by few times, and I was able to see it easily, plus balloons passing by and go high up pretty fast.  All the sighting took about 20 minutes. I tried to do all possible in order to record it with my cellphone through the binoculars, it is shaky but visible.  I lost the object out of my sight the same it appeared, instantly.  One moment it was there then I looked ! away for 2-3 seconds  and I tried to find it but it was gone.  It dissapeared within seconds.;49.2668334860055;-123.105239694657
