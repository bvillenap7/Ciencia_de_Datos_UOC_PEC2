String of lights drifting over Okanagan night sky.;2019-05-24 00:20:00;2.5 minutes;String of lights drifting over Okanagan night sky. Clear night sky, 5 Kilometers outside of a small town, so no light pollution.  I walked outside from a friend's place, after playing board games, looked up at the sky and noticed a set of 4 or 5 lights, no brighter than the stars around it, drifting across the sky, heading East.  They were in a row (straight line) and if you held your hand up to the sky and spread your thumb and pointer finger 2 inches from each other, that's how long it was.  I went back in to the house and got the other 2 people inside to come out, we watched it drift across the sky for 2-3 minutes, unable to come up with an explanation.  It eventually went over the nearest mountain range.  There was no sound.;50.4508;-119.1831
