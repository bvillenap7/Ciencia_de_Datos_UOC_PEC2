I woke up from a light sleep to what I thought was car lights at 12:28 in the morning on March 13th. I instantly saw a huge bright orange, yellow and white ovalish shaped light moving over Rose Swanson Mountain north towards Enderby.  It was so bright that it glowed through the trees almost like rays of light as it went farther on.  Now I told my husband of this event 2 days after because I was a little afraid of what he may think.  He informed me that they had mentioned on the news people had seen something and it was confirmed to be space junk!   I laughed nervously for I know what I saw moved horizontialy and in other ways that are UNEXPLAINABLE.   I had no fear when I was experiencing this and hope for those of you who are fearful a sad description of space junk helps you sleep at night. Hopefully we see some proof of this space junk.
