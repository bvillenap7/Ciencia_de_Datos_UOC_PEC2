Rose 5 degrees above horizon. Stayed stationary for 30 seconds. Went horizontal at incredible speed. Not sure if it was in atmospere. I was watching the stars from my bed. Very dark here in the North. A light appeared from the edge of the ridge and climbed a few degrees. I went to the window and tried to discern where it was. A very bright light that should have lit up the trees but didn't. Therefore I figured it was at a high altitude. The light remained stationary for a few moments and then sped off to the west at an incredible speed. More lights have been observed here off and on. I am a surveyor and I am very familiar with identifying landmarks from the air. I am also trained in airial photo interpretation and I habitually try to bring everything into perspective. I couldn't do that here though. There was nothing to judge by except the ridge.;54.0508;-124.7792
