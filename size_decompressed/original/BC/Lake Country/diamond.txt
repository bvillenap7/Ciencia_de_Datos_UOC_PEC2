Driving home in the evening at about 8:30 in a long line of cars, perhaps 10 or more, travelling at about 80 kms an hour.  It was beside the lake in Lake Country, and I looked up for  a moment at the night sky and observed a very bright light about 100 feet or less above the lake near the edge of the road.  It appeared to be hovering and at first I thought it was a helicopter, but as I looked again, I noted that it was now moving and getting lower and sped up slightly.  It also had a triangle shape wing at each side, the one of the left was red and lit up, and on the right was blue.   It dropped down quite low and then fell behind my field of vision.  It was quite astonishing to see it that close. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));50.0243;-119.4021
