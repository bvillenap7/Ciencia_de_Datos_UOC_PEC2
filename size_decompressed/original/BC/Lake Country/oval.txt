Oval ball of light seen over Kalamalka lake;2004-06-03 17:06:00;a few seconds;Oval ball of light seen over Kalamalka lake Well I was watching the CHBC news last night around 11:30. Right befor the weather they showed some home video of Kalamalka lake. The video was looking at the nice day when from the bottom left, near the lake a small oval ball shoot across the lens going up to the top right of the film! It moved very fast. They showed it a few times and close up and they have no idea what it is. So I called into CHBC to ask about getting a copy of this tape and it might cost around $50.00 and thats if the editor lets the tape go. Thanks. Please email me if you would like more info: purerockfury13@hotmail.com;50.0243;-119.4021
