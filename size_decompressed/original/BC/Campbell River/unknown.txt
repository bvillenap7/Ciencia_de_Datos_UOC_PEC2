Shape was unknown, going slow speed.  Moving vertically upwards at first, then started to slow down and make circular movements.  There were 14-17;50.0272254237289;-125.590084745763
Seven objects travelling in formation SW to NE.  ((NUFORC Note:  SpaceLink satellites.

This formation covered an arc of approximately 1/20th of the sky.  From time to time a SIXTH (6) object would appear behind the others for a few seconds then fade.  TWICE a SEVENTH (7) object appeared much farther behind and much brighter than the rest, as bright as almost any star.  These objects took approximately 2 minutes to transit the sky.  The trajectory was steady, and the spacing did not appear to change. ((NUFORC Note:  SpaceLink satellites.  PD));50.0272254237289;-125.590084745763
