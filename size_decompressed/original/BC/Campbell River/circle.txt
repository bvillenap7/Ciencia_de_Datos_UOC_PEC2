My home orientations is SE by NW.  Cloud movement was moderate and star position could be fixed.  I attempted to position my self and reference any above stars with local tree top locality.   Given the cloud movement I had noted that a fixed star appeared to move SW and initially wondered about satellite movement.  However, with commercial traffic of high attitude which I am aware of being that my location is in line of sight for approaches and fly overs to Vancouver BC for destination to and from Asia or Alaska north and south, the object observed proceeded in north east direction which seemed to follow at a rate of high speed similar to satellite or ISS cross over.  But when it seemed to slow and accelerate in a erratic fashion this was what made me focus on its movement.  The object did seem to zig zag in a minimal pattern for a brief moment.  Angle of zag was approx. at 30 degree angles which in perceptional direction went off by a few cm by eye site.  This craft was non- distinguishable, given height and speed.  Like I mentioned it had the look or brilliance of satellite or ISS size and movement.  The rate of speed appeared to be 3 times as fast as commercial traffic and brightness or lack of strobe lighting negated commercial traffic in my opinion.;50.0272254237289;-125.590084745763
