When I was 10, I was in my backyard on a warm afternoon, with not a cloud in the sky.  My backyard has a big hill and I was laying on my back admiring the blue sky, may I remind you there was NOT a cloud in sight.  I closed my eyes for a few moments, and when I opened them, there was a black disk hovering (I estimate) 1500 meters above my house. I remember just sitting there and thinking &quotwhat the heck is that?!&quot  The most confusing thing was I hadn't seen ANYTHING in the sky prior to that. It didn't make a noise as I continued gazing at it in awe.  Now, I have always been interested in aliens and outerspace since I was about 5, so I ran inside my house (which was about 10 meters away) grabbed my camcorder, and sprinted back outside.  To my amazment, the mysterious disk was gone,  NO WHERE in sight.  I ran to the front yard and looked around the clear blue sky, not a thing in sight. No noises, either.  That was the day I became a true believer of UFO's. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));50.0272254237289;-125.590084745763
