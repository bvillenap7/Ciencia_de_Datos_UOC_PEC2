I was sorting lumber at work and looked up to speak to a coworker. Behind him just above the tree line and below the lowest layer of patchy clouds I saw an oval shaped white object, moving across the sky from south to north in direction, which is not a designated flight path for this area.   The object did not bobble or tumble with the wind as a balloon would, it simply moved on a level trajectory, and did not appear to speed up or slow down. I watched the object intently , until it was out of range of sight. The object was approximately the size of a school bus in length and was oval or almond shape with three or four horizontal lines from front to back. It was white in colour and somewhat reflective.;50.0272254237289;-125.590084745763
