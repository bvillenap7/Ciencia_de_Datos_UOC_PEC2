HBCC UFO Research is investigating sighting.  Date: April 10, 2004 Time: Approx: 11:30 p.m. I took a call from a witness who resides in Williams Lake, B.C. who reported seeing a large orange shaped object sitting stationary at a distance and close to the tops of the trees. The object was visible for approx:1 minute, it then broke into two orange colored lights and disappeared very quickly. The object was seen in the southwest. No sudden moments were noted, no sound was heard. There were also clear skies that night.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Large bright white light in the south west portion of the sky.;2004-04-11 23:10:00;two minutes;HBCC UFO Research is investigating sighting.  Date: April 10, 2004 Time: Approx: 11:10 p.m.  Another witness called to file a report, the person said they watched an extremely large bright white light in the south west portion of the sky. They reported the object as being larger than any planet seen in the night sky and much brighter. Again the object sat low in the sky over the trees in the distance. As the husband and wife watched the object for a short period of time, it just up and vanished. They said the object was visible for approx: two minutes. The witnesses told me that there was a mountain behind the object so they knew it hadn't dropped down behind the back of it. They did say it was a strange sight. Thank you to the witnesses for the report.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Home - Phone 1 250 845 2189 email: hbccufo@telus.net Website: http://www.hbccufo.com;52.1444;-122.144
Stationary Star flashed brighty, dimmed, started moving then faded from sight;2007-04-25 22:12:00;15 sec.;Stationary Star flashed brighty, dimmed, started moving then faded from sight I looked almost straight up but north easterly. I saw what I thought was a bright stationary star or planet. It then grew very bright then dimmed to a rusty colour then started moving to the east. It seemed to be far away like a satellite and moving slowly in a similar manner.  (I've seen some fairly quick satellites). It faded out of sight after about 15 seconds. This did not cover a great deal of the horizon, maybe about a hand's width from my perspective.;52.1444;-122.144
