Single object flying slow and then speeding off.;2006-08-05 22:48:00;30 seconds;Single object flying slow and then speeding off. I was out checking on truck at 10:45 pm on August 05, 2006. My little Toyota is parked in behind the fourplex of my street in the alley. I was looking up and seen a star glow a little brighter than the other stars. It disappeared slightly behind some clouds. Then it reappeared. It then took off like a shooting star. The object must have been very high up. It had a full color spectrum to it as well (Like the color of an ordinary incandescent light bulb). No noise, as it was way too high in the sky. When it took off, the object streaked across the sky. It is the second unusual sighting that I have had in this town. The first one happened in August of 2001.;52.1444;-122.144
