two sea creatures sighted in early morning;1992-06-01 10:00:00;not sure;two sea creatures sighted in early morning I am not sure if this is the right site to report what I captured in a photo that I took in 1992.I have never really looked at it until recently.It seems there are what looks like 2 creatures swimming side by side just under the water line.It's probably nothing ,but I would like some one who knows about these things to take a look at the picture.I also have the negative ,I think somewhere.If you do not study these type of mysterious sightings , could you please tell me who I should get in touch with.
