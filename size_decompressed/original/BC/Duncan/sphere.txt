July 5th 13:30 pdt  Duncan, British Columbia  Saw a small bright object, white, or perhaps metallic reflection, very high, moving north.  Looked like a satellite,  or perhaps the space station.  The odd thing was, it stopped.  We watched for some minutes as the object went from a clearly northerly path to what seemed like a geosynchronous position.  After some minutes it faded, obscured I think by atmospheric pollution. This object was very high...  My first thought was Starlink, but the sudden cessation of motion was pretty weird. Anyway green men is my last suspicion so if there's anyone else who saw this who has some explanation..;48.7808;-123.7037
