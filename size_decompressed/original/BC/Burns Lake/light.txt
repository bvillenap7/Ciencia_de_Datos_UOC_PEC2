HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Glowing  bright reddish light, lights up highway #16;2003-11-16 07:30:00;approx: 1 minute;Glowing  bright reddish light, lights up highway #16 Burns Lake, British Columbia  Date:  November 16, 2003 Time:  7:30 p.m.  Two witnesses were traveling back home to Houston, British Columbia on November 16, 2003 after taking a two week holiday. They were climbing a small hill on Highway #16 just before Babine Forest Products when they both noticed a red ball of light a head of them, dropping on a slight angle from low in the sky. The witnesses said, the object, what ever it was seem to come down just on the other side of the hill they were climbing. Also what they found to be strange was just after they lost sight of the red ball of light behind the hill, all of a sudden at the crest of the grade, on the highway , the whole area was glowing a bright reddish color. They reported that the tops of the tress were also bathed in a reddish glow. From their vantage point they could not see anything as they had not arrived at the top of the hill. They were only a few hundred yards away from reaching the top and from this location they should have been able to see what was causing this reddish glow.  Just before they reached the top the light went out. The couple slowed down and kept their eyes open to maybe catch sight of it again somewhere just off the highway. But nothing could be observed. No vehicles were seen driving along the highway a head of them.  Thank you to the witnesses for their report.
