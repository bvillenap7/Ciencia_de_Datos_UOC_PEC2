Darting lights high over Penticton BC;1995-07-03 22:00:00;5 minutes;Darting lights high over Penticton BC I was walking with three friends when one of them pointed out moving lights in the sky. They looked like shooting stars, except they were sitting stationary at what I might estimate to be over ten thousand feet. They were quite small due to distance.  I saw three lights that would move around each other, darting back and forth, making quick right angles, starting and stopping. This lasted for about five minutes before they all disappeared, as if the lights were suddenly turned off. They moved very quickly, and then would stop suddenly, move slowly, then dart about.  When we got home from our walk, I excitedly ran to tell some of my friends what I'd witnessed. They had just returned from a bush party were quite excited as well. Before I could open my mouth, the group of friends were telling me they witnessed 10 to 15 lights that were darting back and forth, before disappearing after about ten minutes. Many people saw this event.  I wish I could remember more specific details, such as an exact date, but this event took place over ten years ago. I should have reported it back then. If need be, I am still in contact with my friends that experienced this phenomenon. It changed my perception of reality.  Having been in The Royal Canadian Air Cadets, I'm extremely familiar with all manner of man made aircraft. This was no man made aircraft, nor was it a satellite, nor a cluster of stars. These were Unidentifiable. They were alien. ((name deleted)) Montreal Quebec ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));49.4817;-119.5818

Pair of large satellites spaced an outheld hand's thumb width apart, travelling rapidly on polar orbit, and much brighter than ISS.;2017-10-25 20:27:00;1-2 minutes;Pair of large satellites spaced an outheld hand's thumb width apart, travelling rapidly on polar orbit, and much brighter than ISS. Witnessed two very bright lights separated by an outheld hand's thumb width, travelling on a S-N orbit, at 20:27 Oct. 25 2017.  Travelled horizon to horizon over the course of a minute or so.  Lights were similar to (but significantly brighter than) historical ISS and Shuttle combo overflights, and closer in brightness to Iridium flare at peak brightness (-6 or -7 mag?).  Pair moved rapidly (faster than ISS overflight), definitely high altitude (space), and were shining brightly the whole time (large objects vs panel reflection from smaller satellites).
