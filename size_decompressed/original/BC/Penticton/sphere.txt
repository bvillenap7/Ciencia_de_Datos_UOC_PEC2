Canada Feb. 9, 2009 looking at the full moon We whent out for a dog walk and watch the full moon, looking West of South Penticton  we saw an glowing rond shaped object brigher than the full moon on the East side of us hovering over the mountains as if the ufo was watching the full moon. We saw a plane pass over the object but the plane look very small compared to the object, we recognized the flashing red lights of the plane. The object didn't move  but was glowing brighter at time. We went back in the house for about 5 minutes and whent we went back to look, its was gone. We looked for a couple of night just to see if it was not a light on top of the mountain and there is none.;49.4817;-119.5818
