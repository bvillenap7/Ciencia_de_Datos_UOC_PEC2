HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Massive bluish colored ball of light.;2003-08-30 23:30:00;3 seconds;Massive bluish colored ball of light . A call came in telling me that a dentist and friend witnessed a massive bluish colored ball of light this past Saturday night. It was traveling from north to south down and over Okanagan Lake and left a trail behind it for approximately 10 to 15 minutes and the trail was still glowing in the night sky. Also the witnesses noticed something dark in color in the center of the blue ball of light.  Thank you to the witness for the report.
