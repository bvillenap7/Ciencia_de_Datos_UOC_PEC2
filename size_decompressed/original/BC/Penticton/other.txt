HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Sphere in shape, metallic silver in color.;2003-08-18 11:15:00;4 seconds;Sphere in shape, metallic silver in color. gentleman called me on August 18, 2003 to report that him and a work mate were out on their lunch break which is from 11:00 to 11:30 a.m. They were sitting outside against the building talking and looking towards the south taking in the view of the mountains. Now looking towards the southwest the one witness observed a long, silver point of light. He said it would have been approx the size of a key at arms length. The witness thought it may have been a reflection of an airplane as that was his first thoughts, but he just took his eyes off it for a split second, and when he looked back up at it, it was gone. (He said nothing at this point to his friend)  The two men kept eating their lunch and a few seconds later the witnesses friend said, quick look over there, the friend now caught something with his eyes. When the witness turned to look at what his friend was pointing at, the object had vanished. His friend said it disappeared so quickly, and he said it just faded out into the blue sky. When the friend saw the object he said it was the size of a nickel at arms length. Both men reported seeing it coming from the west and in a few seconds it was in the east, the size of a nickel. They reported the color as being a metallic silver, and at the end of the sighting the friend said it looked just like a sphere in shape. That was the last time the fellows seen the object in the sky.  Thank you to the witness for the report.
