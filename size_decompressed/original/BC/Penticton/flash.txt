Two shot away and dimmed out, third shot across horison. Me and a group of friends were working on my car and went outside for a smoke break.  Standing around we all noticed a very bright light apperar in the sky then slowly move away and dim out. A second light formed about 3 inches away to the right from the first ones position and shoot off in the same manner as the first. A plane flying across the sky heading west came to the area where the two lights were and then a third light blinked on. This third light looked th come very close to the plane and then shot off two the east, in the opposite direction of the plane. The light moved rapidly east waving up and down erraticly.
