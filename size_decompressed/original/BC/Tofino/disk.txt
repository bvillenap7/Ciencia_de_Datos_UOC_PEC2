My parents and I were on Chesterman's Beach in Tofino, BC, watching the August meteor shower and at 11:00pm, we decided that it was time to return to the cabin we were renting a short boardwalk from the beach.  Just as we were gathering our stuff, my dad said Wow! Look at that! And my mom and I turned to look northward over a penninsula and about 45 degrees upward we saw a small orange meteor coming at a diagonal, then it seemed to curve eastward and get gradually bigger and bigger until it didn't look like a meteor at all anymore. We could see it in great detail: rounded, disk-shaped with three whitish lights on it and had an orange trail and haze around it. It moved at a moderate pace east and we ran out further on the beach to try to follow it, but it went past the trees and we lost sight of it. We all agreed that we saw the same thing, and to this day have no explaination for it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Forwarded to Brian Vike, HBCCUFO.  PD));49.1304;-125.9079
