I just read a few reports on formation sightings and one report is almost identical to mine.

I woke up this morning at about 5am I went to open my back door to have a cigarette.  I was glancing up at the sky and saw what I thought was a satilite.  I stepped out on the deck and noticed another one directly in front of it and at that moment I realized they were not satilites then another one was directly behind it.  I began to count them and counted around 25 but I needed to take a shower and leave for work. I also noticed that there was one that flanked the others.  They where headed from the north heading towards the U.S border.  I am not sure if there where more in the front of the formation before I came outside and I'm not sure how many continued after I took my shower.  The formation had ended by the time looked again before leaving for work.;49.5988086206896;-122.486922413793
Formation of lights flying high over west coast Canada.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-08-14 04:30:00;4 minutes;Formation of lights flying high over west coast Cabada I was taking out the garbage before I had to leave for work in 10 min.  At 4:25 am, I looked up as I always do on a perfect clear skies, and what caught my eye was that I seen like a perfect row if lights, 15-20 on a perfect straight line, and I thought they where in orbit.  They where moving slow enough that I ran in to house, grab phone, but couldn't see the lights in ski on phone.  But if in orbit, traveling maybe 5000 miles a hour, and perfect spaced out, about a inch apart from ground looking up.  And I thought flares, but they didnt drop, kept going direction from north west to south east  and kept going same speed till I couldn't see them no more. Staying up in orbit, my boss at work said could have been the asteroid things happening this week, but they traveling way to slow to he a asteroid or shooting star.  I seen it for 4 min, not burning out, not flashing, just moving in perfect line  perfect formation.  Wierd, could have been a bunch of satellit! es liveing like this same time,I doubt that.   So many if them.;49.5988086206896;-122.486922413793
