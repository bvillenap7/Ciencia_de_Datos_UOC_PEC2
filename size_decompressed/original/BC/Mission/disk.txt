I had my sight focus on it as we pass a few trees and from a different angle there are now 2 bright silvery glowing objects.  I saw one of the silvery glowing objects separated from another and flew two hundred yards to its right and not a second pass they were gone.;49.5988086206896;-122.486922413793
