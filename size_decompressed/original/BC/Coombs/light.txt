We have repeatedly observed a star about 8:30 in the everning slowly move toward the trees on the property here.  It takes about 1/2 hour to get behind the trees every night for a week. It just appeared in front of my eyes last night and so I stayed on my deck to watch it disappear again and sure enough, it did. This star is a little bit bigger than most of the other stars in the sky and it seems to be coming out earlier than any other star, so far.;49.3007;-124.4249
