To my mind a no brainer multiple UFO sighting that has occured more than once in the same area.;2009-01-15 22:00:00;seconds;to my mind a no brainer multiple UFO sighting that has occured more than once in the same area. we were driving home from town in mid january.we saw 3 bright red circles come vertically out of the ground equidistant apart,small about 1-2 feet in diameter,  my girlfriend who was with me maintains that they rose vertically and then went directly horizontal, although i can only confirm the vertical, because i was trying to stop the vehicle.  this was in an area of total wilderness,with about 4 feet of snow on the ground,  no sign of human occupation,  and flight path totally unlike a flare,having no parabola.  it is interesting to note that speaking to a friend about this, he saw 2 of these discs only 2 months ago, same colour and dimensions in virtually the same spot.
