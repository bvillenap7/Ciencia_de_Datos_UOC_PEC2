Motionless, 1/3 size of avg moon.  Faded away and disapeared within 3 second period. I am a landscape architecture gradate with additional education.  I live on the west coast of BC in Canada and am 28 years old.  I alone, witnessed an amber fireball in the sky about one third the size of the average moon.  The object was directly overhead in the night sky. It was behind cloud coverage but did not effect its appearance or clarity.  I did not hear any sounds, but did feel a sense of great importance.  The fire ball did not move at all, it was motionless but very beautiful as I could not look away from the amber like color.  Just as I thought it was the moon, it faded into nothing.  It did not move, but disappeared just like the headlights of a car turning off.  The first thing I did was check the phase of the moon that evening, and it was a half moon that evening.  I believe this is a carefully orchestrated event, that we are each experiencing at our own comfortable speed.  I have a feeling this will all come to light soon, as we are all at different stages of our understanding and knowledge of this greater power or intelligence. Please and do not get frustrated with your work as you are doing great work! Thank you!;49.6979;-123.1552
