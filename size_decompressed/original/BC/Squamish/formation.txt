They were visible for about 1 minute before they seemed to disappear (no doubt from the sunlight being reflective on these objects for a short period of time) apart.(one in front, two following!) Tonight is the first night I have seen anything unusual in our skies in the Squamish area! (BC Canada!) At approximately 22:36 hrs on the 7th of Sept. 1999, I witnessed something very unusual! I witnessed three (3) what looked like satellites in a triangular formation headed E/S/E from my location. They were visible for about 1 minute before they seemed to disappear (no doubt from the sunlight being reflective on these objects for a short period of time) The unusual part of this whole sighting is the fact that they were all headed in exactly the same direction AND kept pace with each other keeping the same distance apart.(one in front, two following!)Now, I have witnessed many satellite observations from my area and have seen and followed predetermined satellite orbits from various web sites(including the space shuttle missions and the space stations). This is the most unusual thing I have seen yet so far!thought you'd like to know, ((name deleted));49.6979;-123.1552
