My friend and I were outside having a smoke waiting for our pizza sauce. When we were just looking at the night sky when we notice on the left bottom side of the moon a shape that was flying in all different directions. The cone shape object had flashing lights of red, yellow and blue-green. The object itself was very bright too and very noticable;49.6979;-123.1552
