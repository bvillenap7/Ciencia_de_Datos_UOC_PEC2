HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  I should have reported a month ago. My husband (names deleted by HBCC UFO) and I saw a bright white light;2003-07-26 00:30:00;approx: 1 1/2 min;Vike: I should have reported a month ago. My husband (names deleted by HBCC UFO) and I saw a bright white light in the sky at night, this took place on July 26, 2003 about 12:30 a.m. moving southeast from where it moved from St Mary Lake. That night the couple who saw it when they camped at the lake and reported it, well we saw it too.  It was such a warm night so we went out and had iced tea standing on the deck. We loved to look at the stars at night, about 15 or 20 mins later I first saw it moving. I called (names deleted by HBCC UFO) to look at it. We looked at it to make sure it wasn't a plane. So we watched it moving southeast until it disappeared. It moved at low altitude, not moving so fast. So we wondered what it was. We watched it for about a minute and a half. We couldn't hear sound because we are hard of hearing. If you want to talk with us,come to our place at (deleted by HBCC UFO). Thanks.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Orange colored light moving around the sky - Mars.;2003-09-09 23:40:00;an hour;Orange colored light moving around the sky - Mars. I talked with one witness for this report. From what I was told there were a number of other witnesses who watched an object, orange in color move strangely in the sky. From the description I received I believe this sighting was of the planet Mars. A bunch of folks were observing the Moon and Mars in the Cranbrook, B.C. area. There were some clouds which moved in front of the Moon and the planet Mars, as the clouds moved out of the way before the next batch roll by all the witnesses observed a orange colored moving around the night sky, but where the light was located was in exactly the same position Mars was. I believe when everyone lost sight of the planet due to clouds, and then seeing it again as the clouds passed by, it gave the illusion of the planet moving, or an object as reported to me. Also due to the length of time the light was seen, my conclusion after talking with the witness is that everyone was watching the planet Mars. I was also told that this sighting was the talk of one of the local coffee shops in town.  Thank you to the witness for the report.

Satellite-like fireball object traces sky then deminishes to faint moving light.;2015-08-08 23:15:00;1 minute;Satellite-like fireball object traces sky then deminishes to faint moving light My girlfriend and myself were out camping about 45 minutes away from Cranbrook, in the Koocanusa area.  At approximately 11:15 PM, I was out of our tent, watching the night sky, and enjoying the calm of the night.   As I took my eyes off the sky for a slight moment, I noticed an abnormally bright light in my peripheral vision.  I gazed to night sky and followed this bright light trace the sky for about 5 seconds before the light diminished.  After dininishing, the light tracing the sky was as dim as an average satellite, still tracing the sky.   Questioning what I had witnessed I turned to my girlfriend, who at the time was reading a book in our tent with the door wide open, and asked if she saw the object that I had just seen.  She stated that indeed she had seen it in the same manner that I had.  She had seen the abnormal bright light out of her peripheral vision while reading, then continued to follow the object until it had diminished to a distant light tracing the sky.;49.5014;-115.7734
