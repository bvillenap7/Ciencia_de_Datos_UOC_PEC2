We were flying toward the Galton range and the pilot pointed out an upside down tornado rising through cloud somewhere in the mountain range. It appeared to be rising at a very high rate of speed and all that could be seen was a dark spec at the vortex tip. The pilot refered to local weather reports and there was no severe weather indicated. One of the biologists was very affraid to look at the disturbance in the air. At first we thought it must be a missle launch from somewhere and that a world war had began, afterall it was new years eve of 99/00.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  A very bright and silver/white in color object.;2003-07-27 02:30:00;5 to 6 seconds;A very bright and silver/white in color object. Cranbrook, British Columbia  Date:  July 27, 2003 Time:  approx: 2:30 a.m.  A lady called from Fernie, British Columbia this morning (September 13, 2003) and told me she just read an article in the Fernie Free Press on HBCC UFO and the sightings around the southern interior. She went on to say that her and her family had drove to Cranbrook, B.C. to attend a family members wedding on July 26, 2003. While they were in Cranbrook they stayed at a friends home which was approx 15 kilometers west of Cranbrook. The next day after the wedding a group of people were in the back yard talking, etc.. and one person pointed out something kind of strange. They all looked off into the distance and saw something very bright and silver/white in color. The witness told me the area where the object was spotted is covered in trees and the light was sitting amongst the mountains. She also told me it was west of the friends home and it was sitting very low, actually the light was sitting in a depression on one of the local mountains. Everyone who watched the light commented on how strange it looked and it wasn't long afterwards that the light disappeared. The witness guessed it may have been stationary for only a few seconds.  Thank you to the witness for the report.  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.

A triangular shaped object came in from the west and took something away.;2005-05-28 03:05:00;10 minutes;A triangular shaped object came in from the west and took something away. For as long as I can remember, my neighbour and I have noticed a large light in the sky North East of our town.  It did not twinkle like a star or planet, just stayed in the same spot.  My husband was sick, and I came out to the living room to see how he was feeling at 3:00-3:05AM .  He was asleep.  I sat down to have a cigarette.  I looked out the window and saw two small lights (white), with a flashing white light behind them.  At first I thought it was a plane.  It came up to the light (spot) in the N.E. sky and stopped. I went outside at that time.  I could hear a slow and distant whump....whump....whump.  What amazed me was, it took the light that had been in the sky for as long as I could remember away.  I came back in and woke my husband, he came outside with me but could not see enough ot it to discount it as anything but a plane or helicopter.  It had come in from the West and continued in the same straight line. Last night, May 29th 2005, I stayed up until 3:00am.  There is no longer any light in the North East sky.  For me it was a UFO.  I like to believe that there is life on other planets but this was a little much for me to wrap my brain around. The object formed an irregular triangle, a total of three lights.  I could not see any solid substance within those lights, it was too far away.  Until I hear from someone else, I am telling myself that NASA sent something up to retrieve a dead satellite.  I hope that the NASA idea is correct because if it's not my other guess is a little to creepy for me to entertain.  Were we being observed?  I hope someone can help me to understand what I saw.;49.5014;-115.7734
