Huge Black Triangular UFO.;2011-03-23 21:42:00;00:45;Huge Black Triangular UFO. On Wednesday March 23, 2011, at approximately 9:42pm in Cranbrook B.C., I witnessed a UFO.  I was just about to sit down outside, when I looked up and notice a huge black ship slowly hovering north along the creek.  It was only maybe 2 or 3 yards away from me and 100 feet high so I could see it plain as day. I got out of my seat and walked as close as I could to it and I watch it slowly move north over top of some houses and then it just vanished.  I witnessed it for approximately 1/2 minute before it vanished.  It was not a plane, nor a fighter jet as it had no wings.   The ship was shaped as a triangle and I could see indents and/or grooves on the ship.  It was like a metallic black.  It was huge.  It was the size of a baseball field.  It made no sound and it had no lights.;49.5014;-115.7734
