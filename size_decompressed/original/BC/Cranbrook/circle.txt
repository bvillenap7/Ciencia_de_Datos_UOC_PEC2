Soft lights in a large circle formation, turning counter clockwise, moved back and forth above a broken cloud cover.;2000-12-26 21:00:00;30 - 45 minutes;Soft lights in a large circle formation, turning counter clockwise, moved back and forth above a broken cloud cover. I was sitting in my hot tub and looked up toward the sky ( there was a medium, patchy cloud cover), and I noticed what appeared to be about 8 or 10 or 12 or perhaps even more),bright areas above the cloud cover.  The bright areas were not right beside one another but had some distance between them. They were not real bright(soft lighting) but very noticeable and appeared to be forming the circumference of a circle ( quite a large diameter).  Each lighted area was a rectangular sort of shape - not like a spot light. The mass (for lack of a better term),moved across the sky above me and as it moved it was turning in a  counter clockwise direction, very slowly. It would go just out of sight and then come back and go the other direction to where I first noticed it.  It continued back and forth several times. I called my wife and daughter out to view it as well, other wise people would think I was nuts.  They both saw it and my wife watched it move over to another area of the sky from where she first saw it.  Above, the question was asked about the number of craft seen - I answered zero as all we saw was the circle of light.  This might not even be related to a UFO but I wanted to explain it to you just in case. Perhaps you could give me your opinion on this.;49.5014;-115.7734
