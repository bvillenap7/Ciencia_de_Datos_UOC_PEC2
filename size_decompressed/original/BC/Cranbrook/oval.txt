Oval shaped object with white moving objects adjacent;2006-09-02 16:00:00;5 minutes;Oval shaped object with white moving objects adjacent My wife noticed  an object very high in the sky above our residence as I was getting out of my car after work. My neighbor was standing in his yard also and we all saw the object. I ran into my house to get my hunting binoculars as did my neighbor. I saw a purplish oval shaped object very clearly. My neighbor figured it was a balloon. However there was no gondola of any kind nor was there an engine or steering mechanism. I also noticed in quick succession two small white objects in the same vicinity moving at varying speeds in a straight line away from the object. Neither my neighbor nor my wife saw these, having believed it was indeed a balloon and therefore losing interest. I alone continued to watch through the binoculars. However we had all previously seen this object emitting bright lights on one side, my wife believing it was reflection from the sun. There was no mention in the local papers of this nor had anyone else reported seeing this object.  This was no balloon. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.
