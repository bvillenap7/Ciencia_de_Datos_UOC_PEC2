2 Unidentified Flaming objects growing and shrinking in size then disappearing;2014-02-02 21:00:00;10 minutes;2 Unidentified Flaming objects growing and shrinking in size then disappearing On the night of Sunday, February 2nd, 2014, I was driving up the beach side of Departure Bay Rd. in Nanaimo with 3 other friends.  I spotted 2 football-sized objects that appeared to be on fire in the sky above departure bay that were slowly moving towards earth.   I was shocked as well as the other passengers so we pulled over on the side of the road.  We watched as the football sized objects got bigger and bigger until they both were the size of a small car (smart car) with flaming trails behind them headed for earth at about a 45-degree angle.  In awe, we watched and just before the 2 objects came down past the tree line they stopped and became smaller.   As we started to drive towards these 2 now smaller red lights, they moved away from us, still only a couple hundred yards in the sky.  After driving down departure bay for a minute or so the first light started to dim and shot up in the sky.  We pulled into a church parking lot and the second orb raised higher and higher above the church.  As it moved higher in the sky is started to pulsate red and disappeared.;49.1802458015267;-123.993842748092
