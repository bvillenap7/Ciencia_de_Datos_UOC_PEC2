I saw the mother ship and two small craft flying up to it ,in broad day light.;2004-07-15 16:00:00;5-6 minutes;I saw the mother ship and two small craft flying up to it ,in broad day light. It was one of the hot days we were having back in july, and i was sitting in my back yard reading a book in the shade of my garage.There absolutely no clouds in the sky,the usual blue and i have a shoulder /neck problem and after a while i had to stretch my neck ,and when i was looking up wards i saw what i thought was a bright star.I looked all around and it was the only one i could see, and thought its not possible to see stars especially on a bright day.We live on a flight path and that day several jets were crusing along with the usual trail of vapour  still visable in the sky.The so called star was well above these vaper trails, that i could see.I WATCHED IT FOR A FEW MINUTES then i went in side to get my binoculars and continued watching it.What i saw next was that the whole object suddenly turned red ,similar to a traffic stop light . I went in the house to get my wife to come and have a look  at it,she looked through the binoculars and while she was looking she suddenly said somthing just came out of it and is about a inch from it,  and it was a lot smaller. I took back the glasses and started to look but i could not see the small object she was talking about. She went back in side and i contuined watching the red light,within about two minutes i was ammazed to see two small objects that looked to me like round or bubble like craft flying from a distance of about six inches in my view through the binocularsto wards the bigger object and they both were leaving a small vapour trail behind about i would think a quarter of an inch.They both came  up to within about one inch of the big one and stopped,and stayed there and the three were clearly vissible.At this point i decided to run in side to get my camcorder which i was using the week before and had my battery still on the charger,and when i came out with about one or two minutes going by i looked up and they were gone!

super bright light pulsing and seeming to grow vanishes when i go to get a better look then comes back. the light was very bright;2005-07-14 15:00:00;15 mins;super bright light pulsing and seeming to grow vanishes when i go to get a better look then comes back. the light was very bright i was sleeping last night when i heard some strange noises in my back yard. I was awoken by them so i looked out my window into my back yard and saw a pulsing light. The light was pulsing and seemed to grow when it pulsed then would go back to its origional shape.. I wasnt sure what i was looking at so i went to the sliding dorr beside my bedroom to get a better look...as soon as i opened the door the light was gone, not knowing what to think and with a weird chill running thought my body i closed the door and locked it.. I went back to my room and weird noises continued and the light started up again.. As soon as i layed in my bed i felt a weird feeling come over me then i was instantly sleeping.. when i awoke i had the same feeling and now my bedding was completly flipped upside down and tucked in as if someone came in and arranged my room...then i went out side to check what the light was in the morning and there was no sign ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

Flashing lights hovering over mountain for 30 mins., multiple nights.;2017-04-25 22:45:00;30 minutes;Flashing lights hovering over mountain for 30 mins., multiple nights. I have seen this craft before.  It hovers on top of mount benson in Nanaimo, BC.  The first time I seen it, I thought it was a star.  Then my husband seen it and said it was flashing lights between white, red and green.  I don't have good vision, so I couldn't see that.  We watched it for a bit and it moved around a little from side to side or up and down.  Then it was gone. Then I seen it again last night April 24, 2017.  This is the third time I have seen it there.  Same position.  Although the this time it did change positions.  It kept getting closer to the mountain until it was right at the mountains top or it could have been on the other side of the mountain going down.  This time I could see the flashing lights, sometimes they seemed to be brighter.  Red, green and white.  I watched it on and off for about 30 minutes until it slowly disappeared over the side of the mountain. I'm not familiar with ufos or aircraft.  But this seems not average.  We have photos and videos but they are very bad quality, as they were taken with an iPhone or cell phone. I will keep looking every night now at the same times to see if this is something that happens frequently.;49.1802458015267;-123.993842748092
