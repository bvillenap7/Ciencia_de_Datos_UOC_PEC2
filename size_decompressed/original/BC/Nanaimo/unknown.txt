As I come to the end of Forest and Merrideth, and look up at this weird jet flying way up, with really short dual contrails. I start yapping to ((my wife)) about chemtrails and how i had noticed 3 or 4 chem trails over Mount Benson for the 3 days after Sept 11, and that i thought that they has been made by 4-52 bombers being scrambled. Anyway, I digress. So we are sitting at the stop sign for 30 seconds staring at this craft, when off to the left from this airplane,  we both noticed this shiny bright, very bright ball, was there for 4 or 5 seconds, then disappeared. We both saw this. The ball was not particularly big, but not just a pinprick either. Really cool, I assume it was a reflection, though what was shining off of what up there i cant imagine.It sort of disappeared from the top down.;49.1802458015267;-123.993842748092
Do not have much time here, Christmas eve, gotta go, but yesterday, my fiance and I saw about 1000 feet away, above 120 foot tall old f;2004-12-23 16:40:00;34min;Do not have much time here, Christmas eve, gotta go, but yesterday, my fiance and I saw about 1000 feet away, above 120 foot tall old fir trees, in a fielf beside a busy highway, a long shiny silver, with a big bevel machine NOT MOVING with a row of lights, blue ones on both ends.  I have not yet phoned this into the Canadian military. I was driving, could not pull off of highway, found a turnaround, went back and it was gone. I saw an airplane in the area later, a commercial flight which was a plane, and I know very well what an airplane looks like so I could see that it was a plane, and what I saw was awe inspiring.  It was the classic space ship out of a movie. I do not drink, take drugs, smoke or drink coffee. I am a rock musician, not looking or thinking about UFOs. I don't read about this stuff or follow holywood accounts, but i just did a quick google search, saw things that are not what I saw, and I don't want to confuse the image that is in my mind, so I am not looking at any pictures for  a while. I have no reason on earth to BS about this.  I will report this to our local government people and see if any other people on the hoghway took a decent look, although they were in a 90km zone and right on my tail, driving quite agrresivly, so I could not pull over.  Drag that i didn't see it when I was walking, cos it took my breath away! but it is a long straight stretch of highway where people don't really walk, farms outside of town area. Our city has 70 000 people on Vancouver island on the coast. great city. Gotta go, EMAIl me if this is of any interest. thank you.  Gogo---sorry not a better report gotta Christmas shop NOW ((NUFORC Note:  Report requested by UFO*BC Investigation Group for follow-up.  We express our gratitude for noting the error in the date, which was first posted for October 23, 2004, not December, which was the correct month for the alleged sighting.
