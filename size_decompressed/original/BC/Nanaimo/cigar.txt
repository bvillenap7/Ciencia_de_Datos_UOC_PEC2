In the evening while playing badminton outside, on object was seen in the sky. It was a definite cigar shape: no wings and sharp corners, just a definite rectanglular shape. There was no vapour (or any other) trail. It moved slowly across the twilight sky. It made no sounds. It travelled at a constent, yet slow velocity, in a perfectly straight line north to south.
