My boy friend and I saw it.. daylight.. right above rutherford mall.. it looked like a planet about 3 or 4 miles above the mall.. metalic... and then just sort of went up.. and was gone.. I didnt report it at the time as I thought people would think I was crazy.. But now years later I saw a report like mine.. and now want to know if there are more... My only comfort has been that 2 of us saw it... so It couldnt be something like an halusination.. as 2 of us having the same halusination would beat any odds Im sure... can you contact me? please?

(UFO) Hazy orange coloured orb hovering over a small lake in British Columbia, Canada;2003-07-08 23:50:00;3 minutes;(UFO) Hazy orange coloured orb hovering over a small lake in British Columbia, Canada I was out with a friend and we decided to go to Brannen Lake (Nanaimo). We had arrived there at about 11:40pm after just hanging out in the graveyard downtown. across the lake and about 11:50pm I saw an orangey hazy sphere. Im not a UFO expert but I knew this was one for sure. And so I pointed it out to my friend and we both watched this thing and then it slowly shrunk into nothing at all. After that we left and each went home.;49.1802458015267;-123.993842748092
Abnormal movement of airborn object.  Assumed satellite- but low height, high speed, unusual path of travel;2004-08-18 20:30:00;10 seconds;Abnormal movement of airborn object.  Assumed satellite- but low height, high speed, unusual path of travel Myself and two others were sitting outdoors on the 18th.  Our friend pointed out what he thought was a sattelite moving across the sky.  I did not note the exact time - I beleive it was approximately 10:30pm.  I picked up the object and followed its path.  The object was moving in a straight line.  No lights were detected or trails behind it.  Numerous things stuck us initally: 1) It was agreed amongst us that it was moving significantly faster than other satellites or shooting stars we have seen. 2)It seemed very low for a satellite.  I can not give an estimate of height, but, it appeared that the object was almost close enought that we could pick out details of the object, not just a general shape profile. 3) It seemed of reasonable size - potentially due to the low height??  Larger than other satellites I have seen by approximately 4-5 fold.  At approximately a 25° angle, the speed of the object slowed slightly and it moved in a half-circle profile.  I would suggest that the radius of the bend took place over 5-10° of the horizon.  On completion of the half-circle profile, the object then resumed a straight line course.  It appeared to be on a fairly similar path as to the one it was following prior to the half-circle.  Observers: #1 - 32 year old male.  Engineer #2 - 54 year old male.  Biologist #3 - 37 year old female.  Social worker.;49.1802458015267;-123.993842748092
Large rust brown faceted spheres;2019-06-29 23:50:00;1.5 minutes;Large rust brown faceted spheres We had just gone outside and the sighting was between 11:30pm and 12:30 am, during the late hours of Saturday, June 29th.  I was admiring the  view, when a strange sphere caught my eye.  I was looking to the south as if it were above Duncan, BC.  It was angular (a faceted sphere), orangish-brown (sort of like rusted metal) and was reflecting the light emitted from the city along one of its flat parts.  It was rotating slowly as it smoothly glided across the sky, similar to how a satellite moves.  But it was HUGE.  It looked to be higher than an airplane's altitude, but large enough for me to clearly tell its colour and shape.  There were no lights coming from it aside from the reflection, and it was silent.  I alerted my boyfriend who was also bewildered by it and then we noticed a second one following behind at the same speed.  They were sort of smoothly gliding/tumbling across the sky to a similar speed you'd watch an airplane fly across and eventually entered cloud cover.  The whole ordeal was about 1-2 minutes of uninterrupted  observation on our part.   Curious to see if anyone else saw these.;49.1802458015267;-123.993842748092
