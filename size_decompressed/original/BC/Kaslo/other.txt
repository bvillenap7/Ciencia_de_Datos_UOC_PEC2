Peanut shaped silver metalic - large - very high up;1999-06-12 23:00:00;8 hours;Peanut shaped silver metalic - large - very high up The object appeared to be very high in the sky.  From the little village of Kaslo, looking south toward Nelson, BC. (seen almost straight up by slightly soutward, toward Nelson.)  When viewed through a pair of binocculars it appeard to be 'peanut' shaped.  It did not move at all during the course of the day.  A jet-liner seemed to fly close by, perhaps below the object.  It was silver-metalic in colour.  Could it be a weather baloon?  Terribly big for that.;49.9072;-116.9158
