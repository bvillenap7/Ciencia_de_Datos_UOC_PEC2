There were 8-10 crafts moving in a straight line east over Kaslo, British Columbia.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-08-14 03:00:00;2 minutes;there were 8-10 crafts moving in a straight line east over Kaslo British colombia. I was walking home from a friends when I noticed a convoy of unidentified flying objects flying in a straight line in groups of two with wide spaces between the groups.  they were glowing white but it seemed as if there were a pilot due to them not always moving in complete synchronization  they were headed east and anyone that was looking at the sky in that moment was guaranteed to spot them and I have witnessed many strange objects before but I need to know if anyone has seen anything like this before I was blown away.;49.9072;-116.9158
