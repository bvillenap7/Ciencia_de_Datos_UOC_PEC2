3 coppery orange lights seen on Vancouver Island, BC 15 March 2014;2014-03-15 20:10:00;2 minutes;3 coppery orange lights seen on Vancouver Island, BC, 15 March, 2014 At 8:10pm while watching TV I noticed a bright coppery orange colored light out the window in the sky.  Sometimes I see the lights of airplanes but this was much bigger, brighter and a different color. Within 10 seconds another light of the same size and color followed behind.  With my arm and fingers outstretched they would be about as far apart as my thumb and middle finger. I stood up and went to my sliding door for a better view.  They were gliding in a row from north to south before smoothly turning east.  I went outside to see if I could hear anything from them, no sound heard. A third light then appeared the same distance behind.  The 3 were evenly spaced.  Then I noticed the 2nd and 3rd light had moved a little closer together. They disappeared one at a time in the order that they appeared.  I watched them for a good 2 minutes total.;48.6884;-123.5906
