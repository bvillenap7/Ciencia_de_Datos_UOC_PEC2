During the evening of the Sept 11th-07, me and new friend were sitting outside enjoying a evening on Moberly Lake. I was looking up at satelites that were crossing the sky when suddenly there was a very bright light that was definitely not in our earth space. The light at first seemed to be coming straight toward earth, i had enough time only to tell my friend - Look a falling star! she looked immediately and saw a light fading off the light seemed to go away from us and disapeaared into space. The light was brighter than any I have ever saw. I have seen airplanes travelling at night and I swear this was not an airplane and It was not even close to earth! At first the light appeared to be coming down like a falling star then suddenly it changed course to near 180 degrees and seemed to be going opposite away from earth.  I do not ever report things, but I felt i must let someone no about this. This is not a hoax. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.
