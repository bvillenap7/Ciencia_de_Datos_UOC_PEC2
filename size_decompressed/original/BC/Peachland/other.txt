Ultrabright light travelling at high speeds and dancing in the sky;2005-12-26 21:50:00;10 min;Ultrabright light travelling at high speeds and dancing in the sky Peachland is a small lakeside town in the Okanagan valley.   It was about 9:55pm, when my husband called me and the two friends we were visiting outside to see something strange in the sky.  It was an unusally bright star, far brighter than any planet we'd seen before.  It had a sort of spherical quality, but it shone so brightly that it seemed to have many points. There also seemed to be a blue aura around it, which would sometimes change to pink.  As we stared up at the star, it suddenly made a rapid movement at high speed across the sky (south)and stopped.  It happened so quickly that we didn't quite believe it at first.  A few seconds later it did it again... an extremely rapid movement across the sky (south again) coming to a dead stop.  Then it slowly moved to a position lower on the horizon.  It became slightly less bright.  It was still for a few more moments and then it began to slowly move up and down in random circular motions, almost as if it was floating or dancing.  This lasted for about five minutes.  Then dark clouds rolled in and obscured our view.  The sighting lasted for about ten minutes altogether. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
