Saw flashing colored lights hovering in the night sky;2004-01-15 02:00:00;2 hours;Saw flashing colored lights hovering in the night sky The objects were white cicles with colors all around them, different sizes though. They appear to be revolving around in cicular motion.  They alomost look like stars with colors of green, blue red, and yellow. Some are bigger than others, and one seemed to move at a high rate of speed, zig zagging around.  Covering a great distance in a short period of time, one jetted up and down.  The objects look like they're spinning.  They hung around for a long time, so long we went to bed.  We have seen these spinning lights again, just 3 nights ago,(Jan.15th)  Can anyone explain??
