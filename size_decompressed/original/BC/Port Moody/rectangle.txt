Rectangle flying south about YVR approach height and speed moving out of mountains and passed behind trees and out of sight. Thought it was Goodyear Blimp but parallel sided and slightly rounded or square at ends. Lighter colour at top and bottom darker in middle [two tone]. Banner is a possible but a bit to fast and could not see a tow plane [darker middle may have been logo or something like that].  Very windy that day about 40 Km per hour  may be a bad day for banner advert. flying but tail wind may account for speed as wind was roughly about same as flight path north to south.
