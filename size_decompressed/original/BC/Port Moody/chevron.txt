The UFO I saw look like this. It was one craft and it had a metal look and was gray or like a dark grey.and it made NO sound as it was flying. It was shaped like a V and it looked streem lined. It had large orangey colored light`s along the bottom of the craft. This I have NEVER seen before in my life, I could see the HEAT vaper coming of the lights and the craft and It looked HOT!! I would say it was about 3/4 mile away from me. It looked like it was flying at about 600 feet (est).  I saw this craft as I was sitting on my belcony at night in the front of my house with clear sky`s. And I watched this craft fly low and slow infront of the mountins,  it flue over the bay in a strait line till it got to the end of the bay it turn left a little. Then I lost sight of it after it went behined the trees that are in front of my house. This sighting lasted about 35 seconds.;49.2815;-122.847
