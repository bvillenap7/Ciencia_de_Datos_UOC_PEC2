At first it was an item that looked liked a hanglider then as I pointed it out the group I was with they freaked out because it split into 2 seperate objects and almost simoultaneously they had split into formations that looked like very large triangles or hangliding shapes that were filled with pillow shapes evenly spaced to fill a hanglider shape and they floated by for about an hour or a little bit more.We were at a beach party that had a very large heat or light source at the begining it flew right over top of me showing the pillow formation, after that it just cruised around then up to 4 more figures of the same shape surfaced. Their is multiple witnesses all could be contacted as some time has passed since original incident. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.

a triangular shaped ufo with lights on each side,and a giant white light in the middle;2000-05-06 21:18:00;30min;a triangular shaped ufo with lights on each side,and a giant white light in the middle Sitting on back porch of my house, when I saw this little light in the sky that was moving around in circles. I was kind of curious,so I pulled out some binoculars. I tried to get a good look at it,but it was moving to much to really get a good look.   I was able to see that it was triangular shaped.   Then it started to come closer, and I could see it had a light on each side.It came really close hovering about 100  feet above the ground.It hovered for quite a while.I sat there staring at it with my mouth open.Then all of a sudden, this giant white light in the middle, came on lighting up everything,nearly blinding me. I blinked a couple times, then it was gone.;50.6702021201413;-120.4028204947

It was heading North and was hovering about 100m above us.  After 10 seconds it disappered but such amazing speed that we didn't barley see it.  It made a weird noise that sounded like thunder but it wasn't too loud. We were and in total shock at the moment that we didn't take a picture.  My friend was paralized for about 2 minutes and was shakin all over and couldn't speak.  It was the weirdest and scarest thing we ever saw.  Every night i wake up at the same time and look out the window for maybe the extra terrestraills might come back and say hi :};50.6702021201413;-120.4028204947
Low triangle craft at 500 feet witneseds by 50 people including 3  Royal Canadian Mounted Police;2015-10-09 03:00:00;6-7 minutes;low triangle craft at 500 feet witneseds by 50 people including 3  Royal Canadian Mounted Police This is the first time I have ever seen something like this. I live above a hotel niteclub and the noise keeps me awake til the early AM hours.   I heard a bunch of people outside the bar at closing making a rackett after leaving the bar.  They were shouting ohs and ahs and look look look very excitedly.  I looked to where they were pointing and saw above the tall building across the street a brightly lit triangle.  Now this is the same area of the sky that the planes travel for landing at the local airport, so at first I thought it was a very low and slow plane heading for the airport.  But the craft was going too slow and too low.  I guess it was only 500 feet above ground elevation.  A RCMP police car pulled up as the people were standing in the street disrupting traffick, so there maybe a police report to this incident.  But anyway, the vehicle seemed to notice the commotion below and stopped dead.  It stayed stopped for about 2 minutes, I guess, as I was so awestruck I lost track of the time. The craft was large.. I guess about more than 200 feet long from point to wide end of the triangle.  But I could not see the whole thing as the back end was blocked by the highrise building across the street.  I could only guess as I only saw the whole thing when it took off later.It brightened to twice the illumination as it stopped as it seemed to be aware of the people below and the flashing RCM Police car lights..  At this point in time two more police cars arrived with their sirens and lights flashing and when this happened the craftâ€™s lights went out and it took off towards the airport very fast but without any noise at all!  There were about 50 people in the street in various levels of intoxication myself and my friend and three police witnessing this sight.;50.6702021201413;-120.4028204947
