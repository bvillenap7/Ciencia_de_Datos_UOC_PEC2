HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  A squared off kind of craft with four lights.;2003-08-22 22:00:00;unknown;A squared off kind of craft with four lights. A lady called and reported something she could not explain flying over southern Kamloops. She said it looked like a squared off kind of craft with four lights, nothing like an airplane or helicopter. She telephoned the Kamloops airport to see if they had any other sightings of this kind come into them, but after leaving a message at the airport on an answering machine, they never did get back to her. Also she called the RCMP and they told her they had no other reports come in on this and mentioned to her that she must have been blurred by the smoke in the area and thought she saw something. The witness swears what she saw was something not of this world in nature.  Thank you to the witness for this report. Also HBCC UFO is also gathering more information on this report.
