It wasn't very high in altitude, I'd say around 1/2 mile or so. the light stayed there for hours(5-7) then dissapear. Few days later same place same light. About 2 weeks later. I asked other co-workers if they have seen anything weird around here lately. About 5 persons reported that they've seen on different occasion the same light. I dunno believe in Aliens. However, I cannot find any logical explaination. Anyway, again this week I've seen the same light, same spot. I've decided to explore and have a look. I reached the light, however it was higher than what I was expecting. about 2 miles high. Not moving. But here is the problem, when I was looking at it, the light simply dissapear the light got smaller and smaller and smaller really quick and dissapear.  Again I cannot find an explanation. Wasn't a plane for sure. Wasn't a star or satelite, not high enough. there is no mountain or phone tower around the area.

Two satellites observed with identical trajectory/speed - similar to ISS observation account on Aug 8/2013 C2C episode.;2013-08-13 23:00:00;60 seconds;Two satellites observed with identical trajectory/speed - similar to ISS observation account on Aug 8/2013 C2C episode. I have just listened to August 8th's C2C.  My daughter (14) and I (36) did a jaw-drop & wish to report that although I am unaware of the local ISS flyovers, (I believe) that on the night of August 13th I witnessed what I assumed was a well lit satellite.  However this particular satellite was closely followed by a second object.   At the time I measured the distance between the two objects as one finger width, from a fully outstretched arm.  The two appeared to be exactly matched in both trajectory and speed.  I told this to my daughter the next morning and we both turned toward each other (moments ago) as we listened to you describe your recent ISS flyover observation, which appeared to include a second object close behind.  Now that I am familiar with this form I will begin more thorough observations & reports as we have been witness to numerous sky-based anomalies, as we are avid sky watchers. Regards.

The light stayed motionless and absolutely steady at an elevation of 800 to 1000 feet I'm guessing, in a blowing snowstorm, and I at first took it to be a helicopter,but felt it looked more like the planet Venus? I stopped and stared for a couple minutes and it didn't change, so I took four pictures through my window and tried to roll down my passenger side for a better shot.  The window was froze and as I did this the object seemed to come to life and a white and orangey red set of navigation lights came on,as it remained motionless.  I took it to be an airplane or helicopter and I was just pulling forward in the drive through and figured I would stop and  get out for a better shot.  After I did this the object had disappeared from view.  No sound was heard at all.  The total time was fi! ve minutes and I only saw one object, but in my pics there is two.  The bright star viewed is an egg shaped dull white with a square in the center and underneath is an orange disc.  I went back the following night to see if a streetlight could have made the orange disc but there is none there.  I was the only witness,nobody else was around.  I am  an unpaid caregiver with a background in radio dispatching and licensed AERONAUTICAL restricted operator.  As such I don't believe what I saw was an aircraft.  Thank you for your time and taking my report.;50.6702021201413;-120.4028204947
