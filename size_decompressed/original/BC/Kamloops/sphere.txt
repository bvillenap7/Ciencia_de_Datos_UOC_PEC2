HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Spherical object moving in roughly an east to west direction over Kamloops;2003-09-18 19:00:00;30 to 60 seconds;On Thursday, September 18th/03 (shortly after 7PM I think) I witnessed a white spherical object moving in roughly an east to west direction over Kamloops.  It was not yet dark.  I estimate the circumference of the object at about 3/4 of the size of a dime held at arms length. I was sitting on my balcony in (deleted by HBCC UFO) facing east and south watching a thick lower cloud cover get fiercely blown - roughly from west to east (possibly southwest to northeast?).  We had very strong winds that afternoon and evening. The sky was not fully overcast and there were two levels of cloud cover.  The upper cloud layer was much less dense, more dispersed, and did not move nearly as rapidly as the lower cloud cover.  As I looked up between, say, +/-35 degrees to the horizon I saw a perfectly round very white object come into my view moving slowly in a straight line roughly east to west (possibly northeast to southwest) above the lower cloud cover (at roughly the same level as the upper cloud cover).  In any event it appeared to be moving in the direction opposite to the wind.  I observed this object between 30 seconds to 60 seconds.  Towards the end of the sighting the object appeared to smoothly turn away from me slightly as it moved into clouds in the upper cloud layer where I could no longer see it.  It did not reemerge that I could see.  I cannot estimate the size of this object.  I am not particularly good at distances and my only real frames of reference are the two layers of cloud cover.  I don't know the elevations.  I believe it shifted direction slightly because it appeared to reduce somewhat in size before it entered the upper clouds - as if it had turned away and was receding into the distance.  I won't hazard a guess at the size of the object but I will stand on the fact that it was white, perfectly round, and it moved against the direction of the lower cloud cover.  Has anyone else been reporting sightings of objects in the sky around Kamloops recently?  Brian Vike, Director HBCC UFO Research Canadian Toll Free UFO Hotline 1 866 262 1989 - Free call.
