A craft bursted out from Venus, orange lights and a red blinking light on a circular fast moving object.;2015-06-11 03:30:00;5 minutes;A craft bursted out from Venus, orange lights and a red blinking light on a circular fast moving object. My boyfriend and I were outside on our deck just after 03:00 hours. We both had a pair of binoculars and were looking at Venus.  He thought he saw a shooting star but I could see it better through my binoculars and said, That is a spaceship!  Look its moving with its blinking lights behind our house and was out of site.  We both ran to the front of the house and spotted it moving east over the South Thompson river in Kamloops.  It hovered and fell like a leaf but did not pass the power lines.  We watched it as it vanished or disintegrated moving east.;50.6702021201413;-120.4028204947
