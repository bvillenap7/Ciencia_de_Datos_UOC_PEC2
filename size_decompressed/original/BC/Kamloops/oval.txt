Sun shining off iof object Well I will keep it simple. I was downtown shopping, and on my way there I decided to take a picture behind me. I didn't see anything on camera, maybe they were moving so fast or I just wasn't aware.  I just got around to browsing my photos last night and was kind of shocked at what I have seen.  It was shiny, if you zoom in you an see the sun shining off it   Oh that's right I took the picture cause it seemed like there were chemtrails littering the sky so I snapped one. I will be more aware of things now I will always look harder in ten sky and at all my pictures.  It's surprising what you can catch by just snapping in the sky at nothing en zooming in.;50.6702021201413;-120.4028204947
