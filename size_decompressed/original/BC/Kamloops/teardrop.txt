My husband & I first saw this bright light on Friday evening, Sept.1 '06 - from our deck. At first we thought that it was an airplane ( because of the flashing colored lights) but it did not seem to move. We watched it for over an hour & it only seemed to move slightly - if at all. Then we thought it must be a star. Do stars have different colored flashing & moving lights? Could it be a star whose light was affected in some way by some haze or smoke in our atmosphere? Other stars nearby looked normal. When looked at through binoculars, this light seemed to change shape slightly ( to become triangular at the top - joined to a half oval at the bottom ) & the red lights were along the oval portion at the bottom - while the amber lights were in the centre & the blue /green lights seemed to be more on the left side. The next evening, we found it was still there in the sky. Could it have been The Bell Blimp? Who knows?;50.6702021201413;-120.4028204947
