There was one circular aircraft in the air at about a thousand feet off the ground. It didn't look like an airplane and didn't seem to be moving. I ran inside to get my video camera to get a better look. when I came back outside I zoomed in on the saucer like object and got a decent look at it. It was round maybe 10 feet in height and about 20 feet in diameter. I only got to look at it for about 2-3 seconds before my video camera shut off. The weird thing was that when my video camera is about to die it lets you know by flashing a low battery symbol right in the middle of the picture. I also went back inside to grab the spare battery that was on the charger, the light was on, on the charger indicating that the battery was fully charged, it also didn't work when I put it in the camera. After the ufo disappeared in a flash we tried the video camera again and both batteries were working fine. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));50.6702021201413;-120.4028204947
