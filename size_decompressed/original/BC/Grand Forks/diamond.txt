Two bright orange diamond UFO's over the Burrell Creek and Arrow Lake drainages British Columbia.;2004-04-08 00:30:00;40.00 min;Two bright orange diamond UFO's over the Burrell Creek and Arrow Lake drainages British Columbia. Two very bright orange diamond shaped UFO's floated accross (heading East) the Burrell Creek Valley at 12:30 AM.  As one would go out the other would light up.  They were so bright that they lit up the entire valley like a full moon.  The light was similar to a HPS light, however the amount of lum output was more than I have ever seen.  At first we thought that they were flares, but then we soon realized that it was not possible for a flare to burn this bright for this duration.  The UFO's headed towards the Arrow Lakes only one was lit at this time.  As the UFO's got further away we started our snowmobiles.  As we reved our sleds the headlights of our sleds pulsed with higher amperage.  All of a sudden the other UFO lit up and both of the UFO's started to pulse like our snowmiobile lights.  The UFO's started to come closer, my partner did not like that and he turned his sled around and we went back to the Pass Creek Cabin.;49.0516;-118.4595
