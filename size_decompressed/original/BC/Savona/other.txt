object flies down entire length of valley;2007-09-20 16:00:00;10 sec.;object flies down entire length of valley i was laying on my back while my 6yr. old son and his cousin played in the lake behind me,i was looking straight up when an object came into my field of vision it  was black and between a cigar and oval shape, it had a faint white haze around it,i sat up and tried to take in as much detail as i could only because i realized it had no wings,no sound and no vapour trail,it flew in a straight line until it faded into the horizon, it was a beautiful sunny day and not a cloud in the sky,i can only guess as to how high up it was, maybe 700mtrs.or how big it was,not much for detail but thats what i saw,i`m not one for jumping to conclusions,and the only thing i know with absolute certainty is that i seen an object under ideal weather conditions that i couldnt identify.
