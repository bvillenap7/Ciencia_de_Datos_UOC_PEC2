HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Rectangular shaped object.;2003-01-01 19:30:00;approx: 6 sec.;Rectangular shaped object. A fellow called me from Terrace, British Columbia to report a sighting he had when he was in Coquitlam, B.C. The object was seen around Schoolhouse road. The witness was up on the second floor of an apartment building and watched an almost rectangular shaped craft with lights on the bottom move rather slowly by. It frightened him as he had no idea what this object was. He went quickly  into the livingroom from the patio to be with his two children. He said he had no plans to go looking to see what this object was. The object was traveling very low off the ground, at approx: 100 feet and no sound was heard coming from it. Event lasted approx: 6 seconds.;49.2698980769231;-122.809814102564
