It was hovering from side to side. the sound coming from it was similar to the sound coming out of a punctured tire. afterwards the object disappeared in the clouds.;49.2698980769231;-122.809814102564
BRIGHT CIRCULAR SHAPED OBJECT IN SKY OVER COQUITLAM;2007-06-21 22:21:00;30 seconds;BRIGHT CIRCULAR SHAPED OBJECT IN SKY OVER COQUITLAM I was closing my porch blinds downstairs in my house when I saw a bright circular shaped  light in the sky. It was moving side to side and all over the place really. It was a cloudy night so no stars were visible and its movement was too strange to have been any kind of human made craft or satellite. Its brightness was like that of a star and the light kept dimming and coming back such as a dying light bulb. As I turned my head to phone my friend to look out his window to see it also I turned my head back and it was gone. It was not there earlier as I looked out the same window maybe 5min before and there was no lights in the sky.;49.2698980769231;-122.809814102564

I looked up and saw Two orange circular objects flying side by side. At first i thought it was a plane but they were flying very fast, then they did a circle around each other as they were flying and then all of a sudden they vanished. I have never seen anything like this before nor am I sure If I believe in UFO's;49.2698980769231;-122.809814102564
