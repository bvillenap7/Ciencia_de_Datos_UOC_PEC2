The witness reports seeing a elongated, whitish/silver shaped light just below the cloud cover. He said the object was not streaking through, but moving along . The fellow said he is familiar with many types of aircraft and what ever this was, was not something he could explain. He was driving his mothers car at the time, when he just happened to look up and he noticed the object and it was gone within seconds. The witness said it just vanished, he didn't think it flew into the cloud cover, more like it just blinked out.  Thank you to the witness for the report.
