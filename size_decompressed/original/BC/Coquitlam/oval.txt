I told her what I thought I saw....3 ufo's....then when she came out to the balcony...they looked like birds...so I dismissed it...An hour or so later...I saw my next sighting...It was amazing...I'll never forget it!  3 globes coming at me..sort of oval shaped..and glowing...I was on the balcony again...as I am a sky watcher...next thing I know ...3 objects ...soaring above me at a very high speed...There was 3 of them...I was in awe...I couldn't believe what I had just seen... about 2 minutes later they came back the same way...I was in my glory...I knew I would see them one day..this was totally unreal!...

A small flashing oval shaped craft;2004-06-29 19:40:00;20 minutes;A small flashing oval shaped craft A small flashing object was flying over a small park over at Glen Park. The object was way too far to be a space shuttle or a aircraft. The object compared to a plane was 1/30th of the size. The object moved upwards never downwards. It moved so fast upwards that if we swung for 10 more seconds, the object would go up about a fingers length up in the air from where we were standing. The object was oval and had a flashing light which had no pattern like on a airplane. It would blink then stop then blink 5-10 times then stop again for about 3 seconds. The object was small and very scary to look at.;49.2698980769231;-122.809814102564
