This would have been 1977 or 1978 i beleive. It was a Summer evening just when the first stars started to come out and my girlfriend and i were on the porch facing west where the sun goes down.  Shortly  after the sun went down and we could see the stars just starting to come out we noticed one way way off in the distance that was much brighter than the rest.  We watched it for a bit and then all of a sudden it moved super fast like within a blink of a eye and was then pretty much right above us, i would say about the same height in the sky as a big plane would be.  It just stayed above us, it was triangle in shape and had 3 oval cylinders underneath.  From what I remember there was no sound or very little but it had a very powerful presence about it unless that was just happening to us from us seeing this.  I almost felt like if anything the sound was muffled.  It wasn't there long , maybe a minute, or so, and then as fast as it showed up, it was gone in a blink of a eye;49.2698980769231;-122.809814102564
Huge black triangle travels quickly;2003-03-25 20:55:00;4 sec;Huge black triangle travels quickly The witness who reported the sighting had just stepped outside to have a cigarette and said he noticed this thing out of the corner of his eye. The witness said the craft was seen just above the clouds after it broke into a clearing in the night sky. He described the object as being very large, black, triangular in shape with three points of light on each of the objects tips.  Also noted about the object was that it moved very fast and was totally silent and went on to say he couldn't hear a thing. (no noise coming from the object) The craft was flying roughly east to west.  (HBCC UFO Note: I asked if the witness might give me some kind of idea just how high the object was off the ground). Again he said it was just above the ceiling (cloud cover). He also went on to tell me that he had checked with the weather channel to see what the ceiling would have been and was told it was at approx: 11,000 feet. The object was seen just above the ceiling as it broke into the clear sky. (HBCC UFO Note: I wanted to get some kind of idea where the witness was located at the time, as I know the Coquitlam very well as this is where I grew up. He was located around the Coquitlam side, or shadow of Burnaby Mountain and said the object was seen somewhere close, or  flying over the 401 Freeway. He told me he was so shocked at what he was seeing, plus the size of it. The fellow said one could have placed or spread three jumbo jets into the object easily. The object was witnessed for approx: 3 to 4 seconds in total.  The gentleman's parting words to me was that it freaked him right out !!
