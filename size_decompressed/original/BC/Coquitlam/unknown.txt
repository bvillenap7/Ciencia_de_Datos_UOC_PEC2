Object circling the Moon.  ((NUFORC Note:  Date is wrong.  Possible hoax.  PD));2010-04-23 20:15:00;2 min.;Object circling the Moon UFO Report  I only saw the news, and I just wondered if you guys even know about these reports, so I am sending it in. It is an Unidentified Object flying around the Moon. Maybe that doesn't qualify, but I don't see why not. This is also unique because it was shown on a Canadian national TV network station in Vancouver [CBC]. Here is the link to the video > http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3PeuamY56s Watch at 1 minute and at 2 minutes. There is a flag to help you see it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is wrong.  Possible hoax.

String of Blinking Red, Blue, Green and White Lights Seen In Vancouver BC Suburb;2017-09-23 20:45:00;60 seconds;String of Blinking Red, Blue, Green and White Lights Seen In Vancouver, BC, Suburb This evening at approximately 8:45 PM,  I saw a strange 'string' of red lights that blinked one after the other in a straight line, then a white light appeared, then the 'string of red lights', then a green light, followed by another 'string' of red lights, & then a blue light. There was no sound of any kind. It appeared to be only one object but the shape was not identifiable as only the lights could be seen. I've never seen anything like that before.  The lights travelled along the waterfront of the harbour from East to West, towards Vancouver & disappeared out of sight.;49.2698980769231;-122.809814102564
