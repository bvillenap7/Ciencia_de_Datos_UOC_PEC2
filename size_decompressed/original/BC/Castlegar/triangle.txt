Stars could be seen between the objects as they past them so they were seperate not a solid object? All three satilites could be covered by your thumb held at arm's length. We watched them all the way across the sky and they stayed in formation they did not diverge. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  Possibly NOSS satellites.  PD));49.2999;-117.6745
