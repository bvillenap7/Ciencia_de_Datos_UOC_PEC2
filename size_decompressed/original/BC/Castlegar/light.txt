HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  At least seven, emerged from the light and were flying around the still stationary larger object.;1970-03-15 22:00:00;2-3 minutes;I was 12 years old and I was at the old Castlegar arena about 10:00 p.m. waiting for my brother to finish a hockey practice. I went outside the arena with my mother and a friend of hers. We walked to a coffee shop about 1/2 mile away. While on the way back, we all noticed a very bright light in the sky. It was a cool clear night in mid-March. The object was extremely bright. It sort of was going straight and slow for about 20 seconds, then made a very sudden turn to the right. It suddenly stopped after a few more seconds. It was quite high up it seemed - 2-3 miles? At that point, several smaller lights or objects - I counted at least seven, emerged from the light and were flying around the still stationary larger object. The objects eventually made their way across the sky away from view. Total time - about 2-3 minutes. We were all quite puzzled by the event. On a side note - I remember we were talking with my mom's friend and her husband a few weeks later when they were over for dinner. He told us when he was with the US military in the early 1970's, he was a radar operator responsible for an area in the US mid-west. He used to track objects on the screen flying at extreme speeds - but he was also warned to ignore them and to keep his mouth shut. He was convinced from our descriptions, that what we saw was definitely not a normal aircraft.

HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  The object seemed to stop about halfway across the open sky.;2001-07-27 02:00:00;15 seconds;The object seemed to stop about halfway across the open sky. The most bizarre one though was in the summer - late July 2001. I was sleeping outside with my two kids - 10/6 under the stars in the back yard. We have a very private backyard - lots of trees/terraces and up against the mountain. The view from the yard is great, with the lake and the City below. It was totally clear warm mid-summers night and we looked at the various constellations and spotted satellites and fell asleep at about midnight.I woke up in the middle of the night - about 2:00 a.m., and immediately had a notion for whatever reason to turn my head and look to the north. I saw what appeared to be an extremely bright object traversing the sky in a north to south direction. I thought at first it was an extremely low satellite as it had no flashing lights whatsoever, just a continuous bright light like a streetlight again at about 100 yards or so. But it was so bright I wasn't really sure what it was. There was no noticeable noise. All of a sudden after watching for about 8-10 seconds, the object seemed to stop about halfway across the open sky, and either slowly went out - just like turning off a TV that is heated up - the light/picture goes very rapidly smaller, or it just took off at an extreme speed in the opposite direction. This all took place in a span of maybe 15 seconds. When it disappeared, my daughter who was unbeknownst to me awake and obviously observing the same thing, commented Dad, what was that and I'm really scared right now. I also experienced a very odd sensation right after the sighting. It felt eerie to me. Almost a feeling of dread. We all went quickly inside the house that night - ending our big camp-out.

Stepped ouside and saw over 30 lights moving fast in various formations.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-04-16 17:00:00;2 minutes;Stepped ouside and saw over 30 lights moving fast in various formations I went outside this morning and looked up and saw a fast moving silent light behind it was a couple more evenly spaced the a couple sets  in triangle form then another line of evenly spaced at least 30 + Had time to run in and get my phone to vidio.  Caught some but grainy;49.2999;-117.6745
