HBCCUFO CANADIAN REPORT:  Chemtrail/contrail seemed to be coming from the bizarre looking craft or tank.;1999-09-26 09:00:00;throughout the day;In the fall of 1999 - Late September, I was playing golf with a friend of mine on a Sunday morning at about 9:00 a.m.. We were playing on the old number 2 hole (new #11) on the Granite Pointe Golf Course. We both heard planes overhead, and we saw quite a sight. At least three military type jets flying in close formation around a much larger plane. The plane seemed to have a very large tank or possibly craft underneath or attached to it's belly. The planes were flying quite low. A Chemtrail/contrail seemed to be coming from the bizarre looking craft or tank. Later that day, a couple who live on Kootenay Lake - and a co-worker of mine, - 5-6 miles away, saw several jets flying patterns for over 20 minutes above the lake. The jets numbered at least 4 -5 at any one time. and seemed to have a very large amount of exhaust. All three of them claimed to have experienced some respiratory discomfort after this incident.I have lived in teh Trail/Nelson/Castlegar region for many years and have never seen a military aircraft in the area aside from an airshow.
