short cylindrical floating object;2003-06-17 16:00:00;30 seconds;short cylindrical floating object Looking to the west from my yard this object was like a floating garbage can standing vertically it floated slowly but against the prevailing wind. It was not an overly large object. I would estimate it was about at about 500' and it progressed slowly until out of my sight. It was a dark metallic color made no noise and left no vapor trail.;49.119010625;-122.625578125
