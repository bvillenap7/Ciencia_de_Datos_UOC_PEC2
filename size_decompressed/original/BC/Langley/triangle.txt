I live close to the Langley airport and have single aircraft flying experience. I was observing how clear the sky was and how prominent the constellations were, when directly above me, (Approx. 5 to 8 thousand ft.) an object flew over. The object was V-shaped and had six rectangular lights underneath. The lights were faded rather than bright. It was moving very fast. I could definately see an outline of the V shape. I was listening for sound to determine what kind of craft it may be (ultralight, glider,etc.) but there was absolutely no sound at all. As I watched it crossing in front of me the lights totally disappeared and I could no longer see the shape or any existence of the object. I called the local police to see if there were sightings reported on that night but their records showed no calls on the subject. I also called Langley airport to see if they had any kind of search lights or strobes that would reach my location, although there was no cloud cover or mist in the sky that would have caused a reflection.They were not aware of any calls. I know what I saw, and it was definately nothing I've seen before. I felt very baffled and looked like I had seen a ghost according to my family. I keep mulling it over in my head trying to imagine what this could have possilby been. If anyone had a similar experience on the evening of Oct 12th and living in the Murrayville, to Aldergrove area, I would really like them to share it.;49.119010625;-122.625578125
A triangular shaped craft appeared in the night sky.;2013-07-28 22:40:00;20 seconds;A triangular shaped craft appeared in the night sky On the night of Sunday July 28, 2013 I was laying outside stargazing.  After about 15-20 minutes at approximately 10:40 pm 3 lights appeared simultaneously in the sky that were in a triangular formation.  They looked like stars at first but continued to get brighter and brighter until they were brighter than any of the stars in they sky.  The lights were solid, not blinking or pulsating.  They were about 3/4 the way up from the horizon from the south when they first appeared and then started moving in unison northward.  That's when I could tell it was a triangular craft and the 3 lights were actually one light on each end point.  The shape seemed slightly more wedge-like than  equilateral with it's 2 sides being a little longer than the back.  It continued to move slowly until it was almost right above me and then the lights faded out and it was gone. It was also completely silent.  All of this lasted about 20 seconds.  I would say that if you were trying to gauge th! e size you could have fit about 6 moons inside it.;49.119010625;-122.625578125
