Cigar shaped object moving very quickly in an almost fluid hovering type motion!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;2004-08-11 17:50:00;2 Mins.;Cigar shaped object moving very quickly in an almost fluid hovering type motion!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 11-Aug-04 5:50 PM Pacific Time  While traveling south along a local road my wife and I both noticed a Cigar shaped object traveling very quick in an eastern direction. At first glance we both tried to quickly dismiss the object as a small plane (due to a small local airport near by) but soon realized that this was not the case. Being that the object was very low and flying in what seemed to be in a very fluid almost hovering type motion we soon realized that what we were witnessing was not a plane but indeed a UFO.  The whole time we were in view I was trying to dismiss the whole UFO thought and tried my hardest to prove to my self that this was a plane or at least a helicopter. The more I looked the more clear it came to me that this was definitely not any man made object. There were no wings, no rear tail section and there was clearly no rudder.  We continued to follow the object but our visibility was obstructed by trees but just as soon as we thought we had lost sight I saw it one more time and then it was gone.  Wow what an experience.
