3 satellite appearing objects travelling over Langley on two separate nights in triangle formation from north to south.;2004-08-20 22:12:00;5min.;3 satellite appearing objects travelling over Langley on two separate nights in triangle formation from north to south. I observed 3 satelites (in apperance and in orbit) travelling from north to south on Tuesday evening at 10:35PM (approx)for 4 minutes. They were in exact relationship (unmoving except in direction of travel)to each other. I first saw them at bout 70 degrees up to the south through binoculars while watching satellites and observed them travel to the horizon. I saw them again on Friday night but a bit earlier with their meeting the horizon at 10:16 PM on the same trajectory. I suspect they are satelies of some kind of experiment but could not find any help on the web. Please inform. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witness may have seen the triplet of satellites, thought to be part of the U. S. Navy NOSS satellite system.  PD));49.119010625;-122.625578125
Glimmering ball of light seen low on horizon.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius??  PD));2016-04-18 21:00:00;~1 hour;Glimmering ball of light seen low on horizon I was hanging out with my husband and some good friends in a yard around a fire pit around 9:25pm Pacific Standard Time.  We were all talking and laughing, and all of a sudden a bright round object caught my eye as I was gazing West along the horizon.  It appeared to be a “ball” or point of bright glimmering light, and it flickered different colors: red, white, blue, and maybe green. It was visible just above a stand of trees obscuring the horizon, and was in a solid position in relation to an electrical pole and wire, so we could all judge its lack of movement.  It appeared to not move, and just hover in one spot in the sky for close to one hour.  It did move very slowly over the course of this hour, however.  The only reason we could perceive this was because of the electrical wire, and its position around it.  But as I said, the movement was so slow that it wasn’t perceivable otherwise. It was quite far away - I cannot guess how many miles or kilometers, but it was so far away that we got out the binoculars to get a better look at it.  It was very difficult to focus on (just from the unsteadiness of our arms holding up the binoculars) but from the best of my knowledge it just appeared to be a ball, or point of light.  It continued to flicker different colors, and was very beautiful to look at. Towards the end of the hour, it seemed to recede and the flicker faded as well.  It very slowly got further and further away, as well as closer to the horizon (and trees that were blocking our view).  It finally moved behind a tree, and we could no longer see it.  This object was seen by about five of my friends, and me.  We talked about it all night.;49.119010625;-122.625578125
Red object with flashing rays seen by 2 people out their back porch.;2016-10-09 21:00:00;5 minutes;Red object with flashing rays seen by 2 people out their back porch. My daughter called me out to the back porch, looking straight out there was a red light with flashing rays, almost, quite large, but as it got closer the sized seemed to reduce.  It seemed sit in the alley just behind our back fence, then moved in behind the trees.  We could move around to see it again, but then it disappeared.;49.119010625;-122.625578125
