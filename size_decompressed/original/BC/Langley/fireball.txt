Direction change, colour change, blinking lights, NOT AN AEROPLANE!;2004-02-11 21:32:00;5 mins;Direction change, colour change, blinking lights, NOT AN AEROPLANE! It was about 9:32 P.M. on the west coast.  i had just finished watching Family Guy and looked out my window at this star i had been watching for the past couple of nights.  After a few minutes i saw a white light appear beside the star, it began to fall twards the earth.  I thought this was kind of strange, but i continued to watch it fall, not wishing to record the event(pictures/movie ect.).  I thought of it as a meterorite or somthing, and relitivly cool to watch.  The object had then been falling for about a minute, when it began to change.  It started turning red, darker and darker and getting larger and larger.  At this point i thought it was going to explode because of the heat from entering the atmosphere, this happened for about 30 seconds, at which point i noticed that this was mot a meterorite, because it was leaving no trail.  I wanted 2 grab my camera but was enthraled to stay and watch, just to see if I was wrong.  At this point it turned white again, I knew then I had to grab my camera.  I watched for a few more seconds and it began to flash bright red, becoming about 15 times the size every time it did so.  I went and grabed my camcorder, turned it on, no tape, ran back and grabbed a tape, switched the tape and hit record.  I could not see anything through my camera, so I ran outside and turned on the nightshot.  The street light  was blocking my nightshot workage.  I soon figured out if I placed my hand to the side of the camera the light wouldn't hit the lens.  All this took about 2 minutes to take place.  At this time the light was moving horizontally across the sky as opposed to vertically.  I filmed it with some shakey hand work, I then saw a commercial airliner, I decided to film that so there would be some refferance as to what airoplanes looked like on my camera, when I looked back at the object it had dropped down again and was now flying horizontally behind some trees.  I got a few seconds of that and when it disappeared i turned off the camera and watched to se! e if it returned.  It didn't, but it left me with some great footage, and an even better story.  And once I get this program on my computer working so I can capture my film I'll send it in.;49.119010625;-122.625578125

There appeard to be two different UFO's One with red and blue light. the other more saucer shape with white light - 5 lights.;2012-11-21 21:30:00;30 minutes;There appeard to be two different UFO's One with red and blue light. the other more saucer shape with white light - 5 lights Around 9:20pm my sister called from her cell to tell me she was watching a UFO from a Safeway parking lot. I rushed to get there to see a bright red orb, hovering in the sky about 500 feet?  It would just hover and move around a bit.   Then a bright blue light from the center of this object would radiate outwards.  Slowly it started to move away and I tried to follow it in my car.   I lost track of it for awhile then I spotted what I thought was the same object in the distance more eastward from the original location.   I got out my car and got my camera out and zoomed in.  It appears to be a different UFO. More circular and had 5 white lights.  It moved slowly and then it disappeared into the clouds.  I have video of it.   Apparently my brother in law saw the same description of the red and blue orb 2 weeks ago in Langley BC over Walmart.;49.119010625;-122.625578125
