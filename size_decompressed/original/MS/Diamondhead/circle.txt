The night of Oct.31st., 2014, @ 11pm, my wife and I were in bed asleep, when we woke to a bright green light shining in our bedroom windows. Our bedroom faces our backyard and all woods.  We both ran to the windows and saw an object the size of a basketball and brightest green light moving at tree top level horizontally from left to right. When I first saw the object, it dropped three round bright red and green balls from underneath and continued horizontally across the yard and then stopped and you could  see looked like steam or vapor coming out of the top then the light when out. We went back to bed and 45min. later @11:45 p.m., we saw it again and it did the same thing tree top level left to right and then went out.;30.3728;-89.3779
