As we were walking into the house a strange craft appeared from nowhere. It made no sound and stopped just above us. I remember seeing very bright lights and a shape of something looking at me from the object. I do not remember anything after that until I woke up the next morning in bed.  The date may be off as much as 3 years it was a long time ago.  To tell the truth my friend and I never spoke of this event until some twenty years later. After my friend brought it up we were surprised to find out that we had both seen the object and remembered nothing after that.  Why did we not talk about it for twenty years?  We decided that it was because we thought no one would believe us and we wasn't sure the other had seen it.  STRANGE!!!!!!!! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
