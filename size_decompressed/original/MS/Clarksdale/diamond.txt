UFO sighting clarksdale ma;2012-11-13 23:00:00;UFO sighting;UFO sighting clarksdale ma My friends and I were riding Down highway 1 towards Helena Arkansas.  We then turned around heading back towards clarksdale ms when we see this bright object in the sky.  We stopped dead center in the road and cut our lights off to see if it was moving and it was.  It then shined a bright light on us and pretty much made a 180 and started moving the opposite direction.  We then head back towards home after and we see blinking white lights in the sky, and they then stopped blinking and it's just a bright star looking objects moving in a pattern in the same direction we saw many many more that did the exact same thing.  I don't knowing anyone else has seen it but it was truly amazing.;34.256;-90.6347999999999
