Object appeared in the South sky approx. 120* south east at about 20* above the horizon.  Object was as bright as a street light from about 100ft and was white in color for majority of path.   At approx. 220* south west, color changed to include a light green tint and began to break up, losing smaller particles as it continued to travel.  Soon after that, it went behind some trees and was obstructed from my view.   As I walked around the neighborhood loop, I came across another witness with a better view who said it continued to travel until she lost it in the tree line.  Entire sighting lasted approx. 5 secs.;31.5236;-90.1327
