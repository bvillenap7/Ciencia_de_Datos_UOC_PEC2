Cigar shaped ufo sighting in southern mississippi. huge. at night.;1997-11-09 21:00:00;7 minuets;cigar shaped ufo sighting in southern mississippi. huge. at night. Sir, i must tell what i saw, one night at my home, on my 50 acre ranch in the country. i walked out onto my second story balcony, which faces east and looked across my 4 acre pond and above the pine trees i saw a jet black cigar shaped craft no more than a 2 thousand feet up. barley over the tops of the trees from my vantage. it was massive in size. i estimate 3 football fields in length. moving slow at about 50 or 60 mph. given its size and my vantage point to look at it, i saw it for about 7 minuets. it was moving north to south. the night was clear, stars were out and the moon lit up the night pretty well. so my visibility was good. i could clearly see it. it made no noise at all. it had what looked like windows in the front of it. rectangular shaped. and as i was observing it, calling on my cordless phone to my neighbors to run out side and see it, the windows lit up from the inside of it in the very front of the cigar. and i saw shapes inside, though di! stant, of what were heads of human like people. than the lights went out. they were only on for a few seconds. i was lucky to see it.  in a straight line it was less than 2 miles from me. i have 20 20 vision. i was 38 years old. i am well educated. world traveled. and know what aircraft are and look like under any circumstances. my 1st impression was that this was a military ship of some kind. there are major air force bases in the area and airports. however i also thought, well this could be extra terrestrial too. nobody i called was home at that time so i was the only witness. i will never forget it. it was huge. and very, very real. it had no lights on the outside at all. just black in color. i feel strongly i should report this sighting too you. i hope you mark it well. so others can know. it was real.;30.7663;-89.1442
