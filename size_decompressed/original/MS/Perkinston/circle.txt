We came up on a hill and this huge bright as the sun orange with a haze around it was setting over trees.  It was as if someone was burning the trees tops.   My daughter said mom I don't mean to scare you but are you  seeing this, unfortunately, I was.   I was at first just hoping it was the moon but the moon was grey tonight.  And this huge orange haze of a ball the size of a trailer just disappeared.   I call sister in a panic.   I'm unsure what this was all I know is we drove home so terrified we are still up and it's daylight now.;30.7663;-89.1442
