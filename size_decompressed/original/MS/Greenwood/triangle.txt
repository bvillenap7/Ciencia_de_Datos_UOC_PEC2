The object appeared gray in color and was traveling in a northeast to southwest direction, it did not change it's course while I was looking at it. I could not tell it's size or what height it maintained, it was traveling at a steady speed that I can not estimate. appeared to be just cruising along. The shy was clear, approximately 50 degrees F. That's all I can tell you about this incident othet than I have waited a long time to witness an event like this and was not prepared, and for that I am sorry.;33.5182509433962;-90.1742924528302
