Silent white object spotted, then moved 2 miles, flashed, moved again, flashed, moved again, flashed 3 times, then dissapeared;2006-03-29 20:55:00;12 seconds;Silent white object spotted, then moved 2 miles, flashed, moved again, flashed, moved again, flashed 3 times, then dissapeared I am submitting this report for an individual who lives right next door to me. We are both of sound mind and body, and the nature of this letter is to do nothing more than report an event that occurred, based on this persons account on Wednesday March 29th .After asking this individual if he was going to report it, he said hell no. Perplexed and astounded by testimony he gave, I am going behind his back to report this event. Simply because he stated “this was the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life”. He was very serious, specific and said this was not any sort of aircraft, based on how it behaved.  At approximately 8:55 PM on Wednesday March 29th in rural Starkville Mississippi, the individual was leaning against the bed of his truck, facing North East having a cigarette looking towards the sky casually. It was pitch black, stars illuminated the clear sky, the crescent moon behind him. In the sky at about 1000 feet he noticed a peculiar white light in the sky just sitting there about a mile and a ½ from him, just over to the right. In a matter of one second the object moved about 2 miles South West, which was closer, and to the left of where he first saw it. It stopped and did one flash (white light), then immediately went North about a ½ mile in a split second , stopped and flashed again just once. Then the object darted East South East about another mile and ½ where it was just above the tree line as he was looking at it, then it flashed 3 times, same white light. The final spot it stopped but further right from where he first spotted it, but closer to him. Then in an instant it simply just disappeared. He said it was completely silent, and the light was like a pure white light bulb when it flashed.;33.4466368;-88.8186471999999
