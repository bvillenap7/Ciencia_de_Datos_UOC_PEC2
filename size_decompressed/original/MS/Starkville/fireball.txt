It was a large sized lime-green fireball.  It fell straight downward. I was traveling in my car, so I believe it was to be in the northeastern sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We are approaching the peak of the Perseid Meteor shower, which occurs on August 12 of this year.  This may have been a sighting of an early meteor from hat shower.  However, a 30-second sightng is extremely long, and extremely unusual for a meteor.  PD));33.4466368;-88.8186471999999
