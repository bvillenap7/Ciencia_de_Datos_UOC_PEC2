After a few mintues I looked to the southwest sky and it looked like a really bright satellite moving across like they normally would. after a few seconds I noticed that it really didn't have a geo-synchronous orbit like a Satellite. For about 10 seconds it went behind the clouds, at which point I thought I had lost it but my friend pointed it out when it came out from behind the clouds. As it came out from behind the clouds, it started to drop in the sky, somewhat zig-zagging and moved toward the horizon at which point it was moving too fast and was too bright to be a satellite. Just as it was due south fairly high above the horizon,  we noticed two very faint lights moving towards the main big light at the same time. Right after they started to move together the lights suddenly disappeared, sort of like a fading effect. Didn't see anything else after that.;33.4466368;-88.8186471999999
