I fists believed to be aircraft of military maybe due to the horizontal movement and flash of lights , then the first light began to strink and disappea , the other two followed.  This led me to think well maybe these are oddly 3 falling stars in rare motion, so I began to make wishes upon then appeared two more floating horizontal and they strunk then disappeared, trees and a light pole restricted my view of were this was coming from in the sky , the boom the brightest and last one appeared and followed the others.  This left me baffled,  I am not one to look up ufo info nor have I ever encountered such, I searched the internet and was led to extraterrestrial information which led me here.  I don't know if what I witnessed was a natural cause but I feel the need to report this just in case someone else caught it too.;33.3962591836735;-91.0308897959184
