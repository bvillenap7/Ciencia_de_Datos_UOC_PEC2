I saw a black triangular objest moving slowly in a south direction.  I couldn't tell how high it was nor how big it was.  I saw no lights but it was completely black and all the edges were strait lines. The main body looked triangular and the other one or two objects were moving either below it or above it because the entire shape would change shapes but I could tell it had to be more than one unit.  It moved really slow through the air.  We watched it as long as we could.  We never heard a sound from the thing.  The smaller units would casually move a little but the main triangle never moved a different direction.  I have seen lots of farmers burn their fields and this didn't look anything like that.  It wasn't a kite.  It wasn't a balloon.  I thought from the start that it was about 500 feet above the ground.;33.3962591836735;-91.0308897959184
