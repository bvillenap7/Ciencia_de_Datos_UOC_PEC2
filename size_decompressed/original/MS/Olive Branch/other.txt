At 07:05 10/19/06 I was alone in my car traveling North at the 7700 block on Hacks Cross Road in Olive Branch, MS.  There was heavy rush hour traffic and it was just beginning to get daylight.  Out my drivers side window at approximately 10 o'clock and about 30 degrees up I saw an oddly shaped black craft traveling directly Southeast.  The instant I spotted it, I leaned down and watched as it traveled in a straight line from NW to SE directly over my roof.  It was in my sight for 2, maybe 3 seconds at the most.  The reason it caught my eye was due to its low altitude and odd shape.  There was a low ceiling and patchy dense fog in the immediate area.   Judging from the apparent altitude of 100-150 feet, the craft was clearly visable and appeared to have a very flattened fuselage 15-20 feet in length, 6-8 feet across with short canards 2-3 feet long approximately 5 feet from the aft end.  It was traveling in the range of 125 to 150 knots would be my best guess.  I saw no lights on the craft in the brief time it was in my sight.  There were no visible means of propulsion and my first impression was that it resembled a shortened cruise missle.  I tried to see it as it passed farther to the SE but my view was blocked.  I did have the radio on, but didn't hear any loud noise I would expect from an aircraft at that altitude.  I continued to look in the general SE direction to see if there were any sudden flashes of light but did not observe any. My location was approximately 1/4 mile West of the Olive Branch airport and 8 miles SE from the Memphis International Airport.  The craft was traveling at such a low altitude it was very unlikely that it could have been on approach to OLV as the runway is north & south. I am a Mechanical Engineer and have some knowledge of aircraft.;34.9441;-89.8544000000001
Lightbeams in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  We believe the light beams are rays of sunlight, shining through broken clouds.  PD));2018-09-25 18:25:00;2 minutes;Lightbeams in the sky I am Dutch.  Me and my partner were on holiday in the USA and driving on the freeway US-78.  We saw beams of lights while we were driving.  It looked like sunbeams, but they were coming from below. The sun was no where near.  The origin seemed to be on earth somewere.  We had never seen something like that. I did not see a object.  I only saw the lightbeams. I have photo's and a short video of this event. I would like to know if more people saw this and if anyone knows what this was.
