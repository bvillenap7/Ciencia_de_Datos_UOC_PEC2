Two cylinder type objects or shadows traversing over full wolf moon Jan. 2, 2018;2018-01-02 06:38:00;10-15 seconds;Two cylinder type objects or shadows traversing over fullwolf moon Jan. 2, 2018. On Jan. 2, 2018, my husband (former airline pilot with 22,000 hours) and I were traveling on Lamar Ext. (Hwy. 78), coming our of Olive Branch, Mississippi to Memphis.  Just before the Tennessee line, I witnessed two cylindrical objects or shadows moving vertically over the face of a full wolf moon.   My husband viewed one, and I viewed both.  #2 was higher than #1.  He was driving and #2 was out of the bright face of the moon and could no longer be seen when he observed #1.   Once the objects or shadows were out of the bright face of the moon, they were no longer visible.  Other people viewed this I am sure, speak up.;34.9441;-89.8544000000001
