We saw two disk like objects crash.;2002-10-03 14:00:00;about or around 10 minute;We saw two disk like objects crash. I was downtown in Olive Branch Mississippi near Memphis when there where about five metallic silver disc like objects hovering and makeing odd and strange movements without a sound.  A lot of people were pulled on the side of the road wathching them. suddenly two of the objects crashed into each other in a nearby field.  The others flew away at an amazing high speed.  Some kind of military personel took the rubble away it was like they didnt want anyone seeing what had crashed.  They later said they were all weather balloons, but if it were weather balloons why were they in such a hurry to pick up the rubble.;34.9441;-89.8544000000001

The craft slowly flew past seemingly eratic at times like a bird might fly. It was mid day clear skies however there seemed to be a haze around the craft. We watched the craft fly at a low altitude for a mile or more then ascend into the upper atmosphere until out of sight.
