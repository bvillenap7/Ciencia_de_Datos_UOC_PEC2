unexplanable light over rural olive branch, ms;2010-09-22 19:45:00;30 minutes;unexplanable light over rural olive branch, ms Neighbours called me outside to show me this strange light in the sky.  It was just above the tree lines to our southwest. It was very bright and at first did not move.  There were planes in the sky but this was in the same spot for about 15 minutes.  Then the light got bigger and much brighter.  Then it slowly descendwd, stopped again for about 10 minutes or so then was seen through tree tops before disappearing.

It got bigger and then dimmer and at one time I sware it turned into a v.  It moved up about two inches and stopped and then slowly went up.   Then stopped.  Then turned off.  And I thought it was gone.   Then bam it slowly came back on.  It looks like it's looking for something.  I sware at one point it shined its lights in my direction and it just seemed like headlights in the sky looking at me.   Then turned away.  It was really really bright.  And wasn't a plane because it didn't move and when it did move it moved really fast in the sky.  And planes don't turn their lights off.   This is weird.  I watch the skies all the time.   My dad is a pilot so I always just watch the skies.  I've never seen this.  This was different.  This was like a tiny sun.  That could move faster than fast turn off and then vear up.
