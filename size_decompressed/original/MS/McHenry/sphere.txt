Reflective spherical object approx the size of a large motor vehicle hovering motionless and noiseless in sky east of Hwy 49 in McHenry, MS on 10/09/18 at approx 18:13.  Saw it when I was headed southbound on Hwy 49 coming up on the Dollar General.  Object was still for several seconds about 500 to 1000 ft from the ground then began making quick, lateral and vertical movements such that it covered great expanses of ground instantaneously with no chem trails or noise.  Next it began to climb vertically into a cumulus cloud located directly overhead and completely disappeared.  It didnâ€™t appear to exit the cloud.  Seconds later, 3 black helicopters came from the west flying in the direction of where the object had been.  Once they crossed Hwy 49 they fanned out and ultimately headed in a SE direction until they were out of sight.;30.6994;-89.1571
