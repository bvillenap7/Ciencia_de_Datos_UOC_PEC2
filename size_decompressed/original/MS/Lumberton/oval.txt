Extremely bright brilliant white oval hoovering in the E sky outside of Lumberton, MS, near Carnes area.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus?  PD));2015-10-11 03:00:00;Unknown;Extremely bright brilliant white oval hoovering in the eastern sky outside of Lumberton, MS near Carnes area. Our dogs were extremely restless and barking a lot.  Our inside dog was also very agitated and started whining to go outside (the first time in the 5 months we have had him).  I went out to walk him and I noticed a very bright light in the sky moving quickly around a small area to the east of our home.  We live in the country and so it was particularly noticeable.  I yelled at my husband to come outside, NOW.  He did and said I was crazy that was the North star.  I assured him it was not.  It was MUCH brighter and in the East.  He said to go get my phone and record it but it was dead so I plugged it in to charge.  I went back and looked at it a couple of times and it remained in that area.  He said I crazy and to come to bed.  Not long after that the dogs seemed to quieten down. Tonight, my husband went back outside and called me out there.  No object was in the sky tonight and he started freaking out asking me why I didn't record itâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  Venus?  PD));30.9979;-89.4547
