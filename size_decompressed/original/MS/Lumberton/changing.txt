I went in to get my camera (unfortunately a cheap one), and when I got back outside, they started moving around and changing both color and it appeared that they changed shape. I am ex-military, Aviation, these were NOT planes, choppers, or balloons of any kind. They moved in ways and at speeds that our (as in made on this planet) aircraft are simply not capable of doing. The next night my husband to a picture of what looks like the moon, except it was BEHIND him! The pictures are being sent with this report. They appeared as (in the following order) a very large ball of fire, a bright light not unlike a very bright star, then as dark gray. They moved at incredible speeds in several different directions, then would come to a complete halt instantly. The one my husband got a picture of changed colors from white to yellow to blue to red and back to white ...... then it disappeared.;30.9979;-89.4547
