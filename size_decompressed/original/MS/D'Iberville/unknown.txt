Transparent lights.;2019-04-09 20:44:00;5 seconds;Transparent Lights While getting ready to take a few photo's of the International Space Station as it made its fly over here in South Mississippi last night 4-9-19.  The ISS was 28 degrees above the Horizon moving WNW to S at 50 degrees above the horizon.   As I was setting up, I notice two transparent object moving NW to W at a high rate of speed and seem to be in tight formation and almost looked as they where trying to pass on another.  They made no sound, had two lights, and moved way to fast to be any type of aircraft.  Before I could get my camera turned around they where gone may be last 5 seconds or so before they where out of site.   Judging from my position which was anywhere between 50-100 feet they looked to be between 20-30 degrees above the horizon.;30.4419;-88.8959
