4 lights in a row  out front of 3 bright lights at rear flying low and slow (maybe 1000 ft) and no sound.;2008-01-15 18:00:00;60sec;4 lights in a row  out front of 3 bright lights at rear flying low and slow (maybe 1000 ft) and no sound. My wife and I driving up our drive way,heading west saw two bright lights behind our property at about 35 degrees and appeared to me as being stationary.   After stopping and getting out of car it seemed to be moving very slow toward my house and not very high and no sound that I could hear.  The closer the lights came the futher the  lights seem to be apart but attached somehow (as in 1 craft).  As it was more overhead I noted other lights in the shape of a T.  now there were three bright lights at the rear or top of the T equally spaced and four lights in a row out in front of three bright lights. The second light from the front seem to change color from white to reddish, blue, green then back to white for about 2 or 3 seconds and then stayed white.  The craft was heading east and seem to be gliding insteat of being propelled by anything. I worked in the space program for thirty years and now retired.  my wife is a retired social worker from the state of Mississippi.;30.6181;-89.5783
