not a plane  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellite??  One of four reports from same source.  PD));2006-03-03 19:15:00;1min;While looking at stars, noticed light as bright as a star moving across sky, from west to east, moving quicker than a plane, no blinking ligts,no noise, just white light.  Skys are clear, no clouds, object just faded quickly and was gone.  Out here in the  country, see lots of planes, this was not a plane! ((NUFORC Note:  Possible satellite??

flashing light in northeastern sky  ((NUFORC Note:  One of four reports from same source.  Sighting of Sirius??  PD));2008-03-28 21:20:00;10 minutes;flashing light in northeastern sky While sitting outside with my daughter, we noticed a light flashing/strobing in the northeastern sky. We thought it might be a plane or a helicopter. At first it was just sitting still, then it started to move up and down and side to side and somtimes in a circular motion. We watched it for about 10 minutes, then it just faded away.  The witnesses are a medical professional and a high school senior. ((NUFORC Note:  One of four reports from same source.

same flashing light, doing the same thing, 3rd time this week,  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius??  PD));2008-04-04 21:00:00;2 hours;same flashing light, doing the same thing, 3rd time this week Again in the same area in the sky (northeastern) we are witnessing a light with flashing/strobing colored lights, (red,green,white). It moves up,down side to side, and in a circular motion. Very quick, not like a plane or helicopter. Sometimes it is close enough to see the flashing lights and sometimes far enough away to only appear as a star. But stars do not move, actually nothing I have ever seen in the sky moves like this thing does. I see in previous reports that other people in Missisiipp have seen this also, in the same area of the sky. Is there any reasonable explanation for what we have seen? This is for me the 3rd time I have witnessed this in a week. And frankly it is creeping me out a little. I do believe there is somthing out there, but why are they out there this close? It makes me think that they want us to see them. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius??  PD));30.6181;-89.5783
