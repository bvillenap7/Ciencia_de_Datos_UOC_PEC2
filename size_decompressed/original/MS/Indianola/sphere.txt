Green fireball seen heading east.;2001-05-04 21:10:00;10 secounds;Green fireball seen heading east. While attending a little league baseball game, I noticed to the east a green glowing fireball that left a trail behind it.  The object was heading east away from my position.  It was commented on by several in attendance of the game.  It was about 1/4 the size of a full moon.  But this is only a guess as it seemed to be far away, which may explain it seemingly slow  movement . ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous.  PD));33.4524;-90.6528
