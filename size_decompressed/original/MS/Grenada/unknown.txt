Satellite stops, flases and disappears;2009-08-12 04:20:00;30 sec;Satellite stops, flases and disappears I got up at 4:09, (yes, I hit the snooze button once), to see the meteor shower.  After going out to see if the sky was clear I woke my wife, put the coffee on and went out.  There was a particulary bright planet low in the western sky so I went in to get my binoculars. After a look at the planet, I was looking up at the sky and saw what I thought was a satellite moving northward directly overhead.   It was as bright and as big as the brighter stars and moving slowly.  Cool I thought and brought my glasses up to my eyes to get a better look.  As I watched it in the binoculars, it stopped, flashed twice as bright and disappeared.;33.7731;-89.8079
