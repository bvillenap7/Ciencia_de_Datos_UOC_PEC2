3 UFO's over Grenada Lake  Mississippi;1975-08-15 18:00:00;30 minutes;3 UFO's over Grenada Lake  Mississippi One August evening I was swimming in Grenada Lake, I swim on my back a lot I noticed two 2 UFO’s flying at cloud level. They were rolling in and out of the clouds traveling at a very high speed.  These craft appeared to be round in shape with a slight dome being silver, very metallic in color. By there height ( at cloud level )  I would say they were a good size. The Jet seemed small in comparison, like a toy.  I got out of the water and ran to my truck to get my binoculars. This is when I noticed what appeared to be an Air Force Jet climbing and traveling in there direction.  It was really easy to pick up and watch the jet with my  binoculars but the UFO’s were just moving to fast.  Comparing the Jet to the UFO’s would be like a Model A going up against a  Ferrari.  These 2  craft kept flying circles, rolling in and out of the clouds( I have never seen any air craft perform like this ),  a third 3rd  UFO  appeared and they vanished.;33.7731;-89.8079
