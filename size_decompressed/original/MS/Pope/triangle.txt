Two white lights together in western sky north Ms, 12/17/15;2015-12-17 23:00:00;~10 minutes (twice);Two white lights together in western sky north Ms, 12/17/15 I was sitting in the hot tub on our back porch and saw what i thought, was an airplane in the western sky, but it wasn't moving it was fading in and out and two bright lights were dimming and getting brighter.  At one point they were facing in my direction and i thought the object was coming my way.  I called my sister in law outside to take a look with me. She confirmed my suspicion that it was not a plane or a star.  It was too close to us to be a star, and a star wouldn't have two bright lights facing us.   It faded out again towards the west, like going straight backwards almost, until it was completely out of sight.  It then came back into view and stayed for maybe another ten minutes and the lights once again became really bright,almost like they were coming to us and fading in and out.  The lights were white,  I did not see colors, or was too far away to see any colors.  I never did come back so i went inside.  This was all in a pitch black sky, we are out in the country with only one street light. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Mr Davenport, We ourselves asked the same question. The airport in the area is not to the west.I never saw a plane this low...two lights bigger than car headlamps facing us but 50-60 yards up.  Maybe a little more.  The way the lights faded straight backwards   Then came forward again.there are no bases in this part of Mississippi.  Over towards the west are fields , cotton crops.  It's the delta.  I really don't think it is media worthy.  It is what it is.  Thanks anyway. ((END ADDENDUM));34.1906;-90.0027
