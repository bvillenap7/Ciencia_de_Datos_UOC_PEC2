Richton, Ms. lights Above;1987-07-15 02:00:00;6-7 minutes;Richton, Ms. lights Above Two friends and myself were parked around 2:00 a.m. at Creel bridge outside of town about 10 miles. I got out of the car to use the bathroom behind the car, when I saw Car lights shining on me,and then I thought a car couldn't be coming up from behind because it was only woods behind me, as I turned around I saw it. I can't possibly explain the feeling I had when I looked up, theres really no way to describe it, above the trees behind me (in the air) was this huge thing, I can only describe it as being shaped like a boomerang, except the middle part wasn't empty like on a boomerang, and it was covered all the way around the edges with differant colored lights, it seemed like it was a hundered miles away, but at the same time it was like I could almost reach out and touch it. The really strange thing was it made absolutely no sound at all, and it seemed to barely be moving, well of course I finaly came to my senses enough to tell the two with me, to hurry and get out and look and see this, well they did, we all just stood in awe, then decided to jump back in the car, and take off, when we pulled onto the road we stopped and looked again, but it was gone. There are alot of sightings around Perry county, but with the town of Richton being so small, alot of people are scared to talk about it, not me !! I believe (my theory) is there is so many sightings because of Richton sitting on such a huge salt dome. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));31.3434;-88.9101
