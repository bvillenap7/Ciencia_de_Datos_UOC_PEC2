Very slow craft with 2 bright lights.;2014-05-08 22:00:00;6 minutes;Very slow craft with 2 bright lights. 2 very bright lights, possibly hovering, observed for 3 or 4 minutes.  Object was not very high. It was cloudy and object was well below the cloud cover.  No stars were out and no other lights are anywhere near this very rural area.  Was viewed from the back yard of my home of 30 years.  After appearing to hover in the southeast object moved VERY slowly to the northwest for 2 or 3 minutes until it disappeared behind some large trees, airspeed was far to slow for any winged craft to remain airborne, it passed directly over my house and as far as I could tell it was completely silent.  When it was directly overhead a long triangular shape could be discerned with a large very bright light on each of 2 corners and 2 dimmer thin long lights in the middle between them.
