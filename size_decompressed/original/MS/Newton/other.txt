Sphere turns into jet;2005-08-05 17:00:00;few minutes;Sphere turns into jet My husband and I were out working in the yard and I happened to see a jet coming from the west that was probably at 25,000 feet. The setting sun reflected off of the jet. Approxiamtely 5 or 10000 feet below the jet was a small silver looking sphere that also was reflecting the sun. I pointed it out to my husband and as we were watching it the sphere turned black and then turned into a black replica of the jet overhead!! I still could only hear one aircraft. Both objects flew to the east out of sight.;32.3272;-89.1849
