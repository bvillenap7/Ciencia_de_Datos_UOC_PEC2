I was sitting in the parking lot waiting for my mother and wife to come out of the store.  The seat was laid back so I could relax and look at the sky at the clouds moving.  They were moving back and forth changing directions a lot. While I watched a BLACK sphere passed over head.  I could see no wings and there were no markings that were visible.  No con trail could be see either.  After watching it for about 6-10 seconds it disappeared in the cloud bank I had been watching.  I am used to seeing plenty of air craft in my area but this is something I have never seen before.  So I thought of you guys.;31.3120357142857;-89.3513516483517
