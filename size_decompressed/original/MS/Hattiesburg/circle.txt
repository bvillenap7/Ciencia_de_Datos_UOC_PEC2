3 white orbs in triangle formation;2012-11-12 19:00:00;20-30 seconds;I walked outside, and I immediately looked up to 3 white orbs in triangle formation- moving slowly to the east.   About 10 seconds later, the 2 orbs on the base of the triangle simultaneously faded out.   The orb at the top of the triangle remained in site for about 10 more seconds, and then it faded out as well.;31.3120357142857;-89.3513516483517
Neon green fast falling orb.;2014-01-07 22:45:00;3-4 seconds;Neon green fast falling orb. driving home from work i seen a bright neon green orb last night. sort of like a reverse firework. at first i thought it was a plane but then i said no the lights arent that color. but i prayed the next 15 mins that if it was that no one survived .  not to be mean but this was traveling VERY fast and i wouldnt want to be a survivor of that. i watched for more but there werent any. i have seen meteor showers before and i know it wasnt that.  i told my sister on the 8th and she said she and her daughter saw something similar after hurricane katrina. we never spoke about this prior and i told her i thought i was going nuts.  did anyone else see this? i dont know the town names around here yet but it was between hattiesburg and columbia. it keep falling until i saw it disappear behind the trees;31.3120357142857;-89.3513516483517
