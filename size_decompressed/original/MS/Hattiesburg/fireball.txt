Bright large red fireball moving SW over West Hattiesburg, MS. May 25, 2013 at 9:10pm.;2013-05-25 21:10:00;20 seconds;Bright large red fireball moving SW over West Hattiesburg, MS. May 25, 2013 at 9:10pm. The sighting was in west Hattiesburg, Ms.  It was on Saturday May 25, 2013 at close to 9:10pm. While parked facing West in “to go” parking of Olive Garden, I saw the extremely large extremely bright fireball moving to the SW approximately 35 degrees above the horizon.  The object looked massive and was similar color as a flare from a flare gun but much, much larger and much, much brighter. The object appeared to be moving slowly across the sky to the horizon behind trees. The object was similar in color and likeness to a red flare. The object appeared to get smaller as it reached the horizon.  This made me think that the object was much farther away than it appeared to be.  I steadily watch the ISS on a regular basis and this object was moving maybe a little faster across the sky but, much, much larger and brighter than the ISS. By the time I saw it and I realized I was seeing something unusual, I got my video sport camera from my truck and just caught a few final seconds of the object on video.;31.3120357142857;-89.3513516483517
