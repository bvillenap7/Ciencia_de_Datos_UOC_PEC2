three lights in triangle shape bright flashing and incredible movement;1974-09-15 20:00:00;a few minutes;three lights in triangle shape bright flashing and incredible movement Fall of 1974, I was doing school homework in my bedroom (across the hall from my parents room).  My mother always looked at the sky before closing her bedroom curtains at night each evening. On this night, she called me to look at something in the sky that she thought was strange. I crossed the hall and looked out her window and saw three lights, triangular shape with one light at the top and two on the bottom, drifting slowly across the sky. I told her it was a jet, but she said no, they were doing something strange a moment ago.  A minute later, the lights stopped moving and then began to flash (white flash) one at a time with the brightness of a flashlight right in your face. The lights began to flash faster and then they suddenly moved at three different angles at an incredible rate for which I know of no craft that could do this. Then the lights suddenly moved straight up and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));31.3120357142857;-89.3513516483517
Triangular Object - Silent - No lights - Low Flying - Light colored markings on underside;2003-11-19 22:41:00;4-5 seconds;Triangular Object - Silent - No lights - Low Flying - Light colored markings on underside On 11-19-03 at 10:41pm central time, me and a friend were standing behind the house we were at.  We had gone outside to look for falling stars as it was a very dark and clear night.  The moon wasn't very bright and I don't think it was anywhere near where we were looking. We were talking about UFOs and such, all of a sudden in a completely coincidental and serendipitous moment, a triangular object came into our field of vision.  We were standing close to the house, so it appeared to come from over the rooftop and then flew in a straight line from south-east to the north-west.   I was only able to see it for about 5 seconds as it flew over the tree line behind me.  There were tall pine trees all around me and the object was about 2 to 3 times the height of the tree top level. There were no visable lights and it was completely silent.  At first my brain thought I was seeing a falcon gliding or a hang-glider, because of the speed, height, and smoothness of the way the object was flying.  but we quickly realized it was a large object like a craft or something.  It was too slow to be plane, too fast to be a blimp.  It appeared to defy gravity.  It was so quiet i could hear everything around me. the slight hum of the street lights, etc.   You WOULD NOT have seen this thing unless you just happened to be looking at the exact spot that we were looking at at that exact moment.  It was a one in a trillion shot!   It was so dark, as was the sky that night, so it was very well camoflauged.   I say triangular, but i could only make out 2 sides of the triangle in the dark sky, so I don't know how the back of the object was shaped.  It could have been a triangle or a diamond.  The back was just too dark to see anything. I had the feeling it was a top secret military craft that was maybe on a test flight just to see if anyone would report seeing something that night.  I wouldn't be surprised if I was the only one in the city to see it that night.  I just happened to be looking for something at just the right time in the right patch of the sky.  But it had white or light-colored markings on the underside, they were on the left and the right side.  They were symetrical, about 4 or 5 white spots or streaks running down the left and right side.  They seemed to defeat the purpose of hiding the craft, but they were on there non-the-less.   I am including a sketch.;31.3120357142857;-89.3513516483517

I saw a triangular UFO with red and white lights while driving on Hwy 98 in Perry County, MS.;2014-12-17 20:00:00;10 minutes;I saw a triangular UFO with red and white lights while driving on Hwy 98 in Perry County, MS. I was with my boyfriend,  Driving on a long stretch of highway 98 in Perry County, MS. We saw light go across the sky, left to right.  Didn't think much of it, assumed it was a plane. We continued to see these light pass back and forth across the road, at a distance, several times.   Eventually, it seemed to align with the road and for a moment we thought it was a plane emergency landing, since it was a long, straight strip of highway.  But instead, it seemed to kind of hover then cross the road again.  The last time it appeared, it crossed the road very slowly and low to the ground.  This was the first time we got a good look and realized it was definitely not a normal airplane.  It was kind of triangular in shape.  It had some white lights, and a blinking red light.  It went very slowly, like barely faster than a hover, and eventually disappeared behind the tree line.;31.3120357142857;-89.3513516483517
I saw a triangular UFO with red and white lights while driving on Hwy 98 in Perry County, MS.;2015-07-14 22:00:00;15 minutes;I saw a triangular UFO with red and white lights while driving on Hwy 98 in Perry County, MS. This was my second time seeing this UFO.  I was driving alone on Hwy 98 in Perry County, MS.  The first several times I drove this road after the first sighting, I was on the lookout.  I noticed some lights in the distance and they seemed to be the same as the UFO I saw previously.  I sped up to get a closer look, but they disappeared behind the trees.   After several more moments of driving, I saw it again in the distance, but closer.  I sped up until i was right beside it.  It was going the same direction and speed as I was, right above the tree line.   I pulled over on the side of the road to get a better look and maybe take a picture.  Once I stopped, in a matter of seconds, the aircraft turned around and began going in the opposite direction.  Once I could no longer see it, I continued driving.   While driving, I saw the craft again, but in my mirrors.  It appeared to be trailing behind me, but slowly at a distance, as if trying to be discreet.  I started to pull over again, but it ducked behind some trees.   I continued driving.  Roughly 10 min later, I arrived home.  When I stepped out of my car, I turned around to see the aircraft hovering a bit above a parking lot/building.  As soon as I saw it, it began moving away.   The aircraft is triangular in shape with red and white lights.;31.3120357142857;-89.3513516483517
I saw a triangular UFO with red and white lights while driving on Hwy 98 in Perry County, MS.;2015-07-23 22:00:00;10 minutes;I saw a triangular UFO with red and white lights while driving on Hwy 98 in Perry County, MS. This is the third time I've seen this UFO.  I was driving alone again in Perry County, MS, on Hwy 98.  It was triangular with red and white lights.  Some lights were blinking.   I saw it in the distance and sped up to get a closer look.  It disappeared behind some trees.  It reappeared again shortly after, but closer and to my left.   I was going slowly and could observe the way it flies.  It can move upward almost vertically.  Like in a straight line, nose up, and rather slowly.  It can also change directions quickly.   It soon disappeared behind the treeline again.;31.3120357142857;-89.3513516483517
Low flying triangle craft with triple lights and ring of light making a loud droning hum over my house.;2019-09-01 01:10:00;>1 minute;Low flying triangle craft with triple lights and ring of light making a loud droning hum over my house. I was out on my balcony, smoking a cigarette, when I heard a loud droning noise above me.  I looked out to see an extremely low flying craft, only a couple hundred feet up, going too slow to be a jet or a plane.  It had three lights at each of the points of the triangle, and a ring in the center of them that pulsed softly.  The lights were pure bright white, like a pure light LED, and though I couldn't tell what color the ship was, it was clearly a dark triangle.  It was heading northeast, towards a patch of woods. I stood frozen for what seemed like forever (20 seconds or so), then went inside to get my partner.  We came back out to see it make a turn and glide over the trees heading west, then disappear.   About twenty minutes later we saw it go back towards the east and disappear into the distance.;31.3120357142857;-89.3513516483517
