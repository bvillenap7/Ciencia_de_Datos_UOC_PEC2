Bright Flash of Light in Three Different Places;2013-06-04 11:30:00;10 minutes;Bright Flash of Light in Three Different Places My wife and I were having our evening coffee and I was sitting down talking to her when a Bright flash over the Magnolia tree in our neighbors yard stopped me from talking. It took my breath away.   As fast as it happened it was gone.   My wife said she saw it earlier about 15 min prior but could not explain it.  We walked around the house and we saw it again but it was in the front of the house over the trees.  It just flashed really bright like a flashbulb.  I know it was not an aircraft there was no sound.;31.3120357142857;-89.3513516483517
