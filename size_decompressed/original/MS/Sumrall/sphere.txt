Witnesses sighting of large ufo with 4 smaller crafts moving near by.;2009-04-03 20:30:00;1 hour, 10 min;Witnesses sighting of large ufo with 4 smaller crafts moving near by. On 4/3/09, I stepped onto the front porch of the cabin my husband and I live in together.  I glanced up to see if there were clouds or stars out and noticed a moving object in the center of the sky with a rainbow of colors.  I ran inside and grabbed a pair of binoculars and saw a rapidly rotating orb or sphere that flashed a rainbow of colors as it moved.  It was stationary, but it wasn't.  It stayed in the same general area, but rotated.  I called my daughter and her fiance along with my husband and we watched it for approximately 20 minutes.  Then, we noticed smaller objects that were moving around this larger orb.  It was as if the first one spotted was the docking station.  The others moved more like planes, but were round with strobe like lights on the bottom that rotated.  The crafts appeared red.  They moved about all around us and this went on for over an hour as we watched in amazement.  One by one they began to become difficult to see and then the larger docking station was moving.  It did not fly away quickly, but started fading and then disappeared.;31.3616;-89.5751
