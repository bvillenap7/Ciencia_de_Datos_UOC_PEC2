Dark amber colored object flying at a high rate of speed;2006-12-13 21:20:00;15-20 seconds;Dark amber colored object flying at a high rate of speed My wife and I were down in the Mississippi delta watching the meteor shower that occured on December 13, 2006.  At approx. 9:20 p.m., my wife saw what she thought to be a meteor coming out of the north (towards Memphis).  I turned around and we watched a dark amber colored object fly about 4 miles in 15-20 seconds.  The object was about 1,000 ft. above the ground and approximately .5 to 1 mile west of us.  You could make out that there was a craft there, but we were too far to see any kind of shape.  The object never made a sound and got about 3 miles south of us, appeared to make a left turn and instantly dissapeared.  We didn't see a streak of light as it left, it was like the lights were just turned off.  We were sitting near the intersection of Nail Road and U.S. 61.   I'm the biggest UFO skeptic out there, but I know what we saw.  Hopefully someone else out there saw something also.;34.9632;-90.1211
