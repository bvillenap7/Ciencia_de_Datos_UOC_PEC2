I work as an aircraft mechanic.   The light was pulsing over a 2 second intervles.  The light wasnt a flash, it was a slow rise to bright and slow discharge to off, I looked for navigation (red/green) lights and a beacon and or strobes, none were visible. there were aircraft flying above the altitude of the object and also below this object.  I live near an airport and could see other flight paths.  I have no idea what this object was, because I could not see a silhouette of the object, due to the dark background of the sky.;34.9632;-90.1211
