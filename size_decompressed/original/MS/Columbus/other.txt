((anonymous report));2019-11-11 17:30:00;17 seconds;I was driving into town on a usual route, when I see 2 giant glowing green balls connected by one long white light flying extremely low over the nearby gas station.  It flew down toward the ground really fast.  As it went below the powerlines, it disappeared just as everyone else in the car seen the thing vanish.  We live in a military town and have seen strange lights before but nothing like this.;33.4927133858268;-88.4267999999999
