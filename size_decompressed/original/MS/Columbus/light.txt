I was driving on a mostly dark highway when I looked up and noticed a bright green light streaking across the sky.  It did not blink, and it moved in a straight line.  Within a minute or less it had disappeared over the horizon. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain anonymous provides e-mail address only.  PD));33.4927133858268;-88.4267999999999
