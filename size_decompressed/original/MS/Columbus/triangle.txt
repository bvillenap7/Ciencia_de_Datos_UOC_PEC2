Two people view triangular hovering object.;1991-08-01 19:00:00;10-15 min;Two people view triangular hovering object. I was returning home from work about 7:00 in the evening and I witnessed an aircraft hovering over my neighbors treeline. I lived in an area where an airforce base is located and was spooked once when I first saw a stealth bomber. This was like no aircraft I have ever seen. It was triangular in shape and had what appeared to be a spotlight on the front. It seemed to be made in a gridwork fashion and had smaller lights on the corners. What caught my attention was the fact that it seemed to hover and then move at a slow rate of speed. I got out of my car and watched the object for about 5 minutes. The front light seemed to be searching the ground for something. There was only a slight humming noise coming from the object. I went inside to get my parents to come look at the object because I had never seen anything like it. My father was in bed, but my mother came outside with me and we watched it for another 10 minutes. It continued moving in a slow fashion just over the tree line and turned 90 degrees and went out of sight. I do not know what I saw and this is the first report I have made of the object. The next day on the radio there were reports of multiple sightings in northern alabama not far from where I lived at the time. The date is approximate as it was a long time ago. I just read similar reports on the sight and would like to know what I saw. My initial thought was military but it has not been made public knowledge that I am aware of.
