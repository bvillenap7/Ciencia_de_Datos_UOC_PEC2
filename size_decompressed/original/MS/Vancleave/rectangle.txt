My mother, my son, and myself watched from the river as a rectangular shaped object floated across the sky in a westward direction.  It was white.   My nephew, a ufo buff, later that evening pulled up a YouTube video and showed where identical crafts were spotted that same week, one in China and the other in Montana.   After that night, there were numerous other sightings by myself and photos taken over a school there by our home.  One other sighting was of the same craft we saw in July earlier.;30.5387;-88.6916
