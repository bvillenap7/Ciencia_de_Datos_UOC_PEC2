Triangle lights hover over pond;1989-12-01 19:00:00;1 minute;Triangle lights hover over pond I was working at the boarding stable where I keep my horse. It was dark out and the horses where wanting to come in to eat. It was getting late. The horses were moving around alot and the ducks were making alot of noise. The other person there went to the one pasture gate and I went to the other gate to start bringing them in. The pasture gate I went to has a pond. Out of nowhere there appears a huge triangle of lights. Only three lights but super bright. But I could still look at the lights without squinting my eyes.  There wasn't any noise at all from the object. I noticed all the horses stopped moving and the ducks stopped making noise as well. It just hovered over the pond. Its lights lit up the pond and the area around it.  I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Then it just zipped out of sight, like someone turned off the light switch.  Gone and still no noise.  I looked over to the other gate and ask the other person if she saw that and she said yes. We never! mentioned to each other again.  The next day there were reports of the same thing in the county north of Vancleave. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));30.5387;-88.6916
