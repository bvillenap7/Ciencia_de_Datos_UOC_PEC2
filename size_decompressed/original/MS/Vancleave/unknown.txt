Brilliant object that changed colors, Green, Red, Blue and Yellow. 10/13/2007;2007-10-13 01:30:00;3 Hours;Brilliant object that changed colors, Green, Red, Blue and Yellow. 10/13/2007 My husband got home from work between Midnight and 1 AM. He stayed in the family room for about 6 minutes. He then said, I want to show you something up in the sky it was brilliant and it changes colors, Green, Red, Blue and Yellow. He took me outside and showed me towards the East and another one on the South East. He said they have been in that same place since he got home and he thought it was and airplane at first because of the blinking lights, but then he noticed that they did not move. My husband has the eyes of an Eagle, so I could not tell w/ the naked eye the different colors, I could see some color change but not real clear. Then when I got the binoculars and I looked at it and I screamed!!. It was definitely changing the 4 colors mentioned above. It was brilliant. He went and got the telescope and it really looked brilliant then. It seemed like the colors was going 'around' the object. One time I saw through the binoculars like a 'light' came out of it, cone shape like= < that pointed towards the other one, that did not last for long. There was a haze around it that throbbed. The one in the South East seemed bigger or closer to us, than the one in the East. They both had the same color blinking around them. We looked at them until 3:00 AM and they were still relatively in the same spots. Both were too far for us to be able to tell what kind of shape they were. But if we had to guess we would say they might have been round, sphere, or saucer shape. We wondered if they might have been satellites. But surely a satellite would have moved w/ the earth's rotation in 3 hours times?!?  Would like to find out if anyone else saw then, and or, if they might have been satellites. Thank you for your time.;30.5387;-88.6916
