Line of lights follow my car at night;2004-11-10 23:00:00;30 seconds;Line of lights follow my car at night I was driving home from night school by myself. I was driving along the wastewater treatment plant.There is a large field to the left where they grow hay. On the right it is proctected land for deer. It was dark and it was cold. I looked in my rearview mirror and there were three lights in a row(up and down) right behind my car.  I looked in the side mirror on the driver's side and couldn't see it behind me. I looked again in my rearview mirror and it was right on my bumper. I looked at the clock on the radio and it was fine and the radio was still playing.  I looked in the rearview mirror again and the lights were swaying back and forth still in a line.  The movement was super smooth, like a pendilum on a clock. Then I saw a car coming towards me and the lights shot to the left of my car and went out over the hay field and disappeared.  It never made any noise.
