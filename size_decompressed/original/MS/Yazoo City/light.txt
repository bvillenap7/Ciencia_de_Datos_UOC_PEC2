Bright light moving extremely fast.;2012-09-12 19:00:00;Less than a minute;Bright light moving extremely fast. We were in a field and my four year old son spotted a bright light in the sky and said, &quotDaddy what's that.&quot It was very bright and too large to be an airplane. It moved very quickly, much faster than any aircraft I've ever seen, and disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
