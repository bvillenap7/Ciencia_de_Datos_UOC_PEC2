V shaped light formation travleing S/SW in Biloxi;2004-12-13 23:59:00;6 to 8 secs;V shaped light formation travleing S/SW in Biloxi I was standing outside this morning watching the meteor shower. A boomerang of lights seemed to appear out of nowhere, close to the ground but made no sound. It turned in different directions rapidly then just disappeared. I live close to Keesler Air Force Base and figured it was probably just a plane. But I could see no outline of a plane even though it was that close to the ground and i could hear no engines. The best way I can describe what it looked like, because I can't remember how many lights, is a flock of geese heading south for the winter...all wearing orangish~yellow lights. Maybe someone out there has a logical explanation for what I saw. I'm the biggest skeptical I know, but this has me puzzled and wondering.;30.4555575757576;-88.9453060606062
