I noticed a bright light much brighter than a star hovering in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));2015-10-13 04:15:00;1 hour+;I was leaving my house after 4am to pick up my husband from work when I noticed a bright light much brighter than a star hovering in the sky.  It appeared to be pulsing slightly and the light wavered between white and yellow.   After I returned home with my husband about 30 mins later, the light was still in the sky but had changed position and was further south.  We both got out our phones and pulled up Skyview to see if we could figure out what it was.  The position was close to the position of the constellation Leo but was not a planet either.  Even though I could clearly see the light through my viewfinder, the app did not recognize the object.  When I went back out later after 5am, it was gone.  The same light appeared the next night with the same result of Skyview not being able to determine the object. The times we saw it were between 3 am and 4 am.  Last night the object did not appear, however, earlier in the evening, my daughter claims to have seen somethi! ng similar hovering in the area of Back bay of Biloxi. We had not told her of our sighting and she had described a similar large glowing object that was much larger than a star. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));30.4555575757576;-88.9453060606062
Odd objects flying at the same pace in no particular formation;2021-01-30 04:36:00;20 seconds;Odd objects flying at the same pace in no particular formation I was walking on a track at Keesler AFB and I saw these odd shaped objects flying over me.  I thought birds at first, but when they continued on there was no wings flapping and they moved at the exact same speed.  I've never seen drones fly this close together either.  No sounds were coming from these objects.  One object was in the front, maybe 10-12 in the cluster and then 3 staggered following the cluster.;30.4555575757576;-88.9453060606062
