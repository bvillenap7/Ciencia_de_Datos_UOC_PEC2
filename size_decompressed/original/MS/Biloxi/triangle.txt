Silent black triangular object flying at low level near Kessler AFB.;1977-10-15 21:00:00;<1 minute;Silent black triangular object flying at low level near Kessler AFB. From the late summer of 1977 to the early spring of 1978 I was stationed at Kessler AFB in Biloxi, Mississippi. The sighting occurred one evening at approximately 9:00 PM during that interval the exact date or time was not recorded. My wife and I had an off-base apartment just off the beach on highway 90 which runs through Biloxi. We had been for a walk on the beach and were returning to our apartment, looking up at the night sky. Simultaneously we both saw a black, triangular object go across the sky from south to north. The flight path was from the Mississippi Sound and over the western side of Kessler AFB, which was approximately 1/2 mile from our apartment. The object had no lights and made no sound. The object appeared to be black, and it was mainly seen because it blocked out the stars as it flew overhead. The object appeared to be flying at an altitude of between 500 and a thousand feet, with an airspeed of 100 to 150 mph. It was shaped like a equilateral triangle with sides of approximately 100 feet. However, since the object made no sound, and it flew directly overhead without any distant landmarks to compare for size, it is difficult to estimate the size, speed or altitude of the object with any certainty. I could have been an even larger object, at a much higher altitude flying at a very fast airspeed. The size, speed and altitude are simply my best guess based on my recollection of an event that occurred over 30 years ago. The strangest aspect of the sighting was the absolute silence of the object. It made no sound whatsoever. It was also strange that it was running without lights, and the shape was like no aircraft that I know of from that era. It could have been a test version of the B2 stealth bomber, but that doesn't explain the silence. There was no engine noise that either my wife or I could hear.

The lights resembled bright white stadium lights.   When we came closer, the triangular shape was very visible and we could see several light blue lights along one side.  The object was just sitting there hovering approx. 100 or so yards above the interstate just off the west bound lanes.   I slowed my vehicle to watch it as we passed by and within 30 seconds it was gone.   There were several other vehicles on the interstate, surely it was seen by more than just us two.;30.4555575757576;-88.9453060606062
