Couple observes Star-like objects over Keesler AFB;2002-09-29 17:30:00;2-3 Min.;Couple observes Star-like objects over Keesler AFB I was standing on the upper deck of my apartment with my girlfriend. I was looking toward the west off and on. Having looked down momentarily, then back up, I saw a bright light in the distance. Thinking it was a star, I said to myself, this is the first star tonight, I'll make a wish. I looked down to pick up something for a second time, then looking back, the single star was gone and was replaced by two star-like objects, side by side, about 5 inches apart at arms length. I alerted my girlfriend as they suddenly faded out. Above these lights all the while was a slow moving jet,leaving a contrail. In about ten minutes, we were startled to see a small BLACK single engine plane appear out of nowhere, headed southeasterly from Keesler AFB. Our apartment is about 2 miles east of the base in Biloxi, Ms. This is my first UFO sighting, but hopefully not my last.;30.4555575757576;-88.9453060606062
Biloxi couple witnesses odd lights over Gulf of Mexico;2003-01-12 19:00:00;2-3 Min.;Biloxi couple witnesses odd lights over Gulf of Mexico My fiance and I were driving west on Beach Boulevard and had just passed the Keesler AFB entrance from the beach and we saw a string of lights hovering over the water. I said it must be an airplane, my fiance said it's got to be a helicopter. Then we passed some trees and looked over the water and the string of lights just disappeared. Then we saw some type of aircraft coming from Keesler headed toward the area that we saw the UFO, like maybe it was going to investigate the same area. We noticed that the traffic on the other side of the road was slowing down like maybe they saw what we saw. We kept driving, but got close to a well-lighted souvenir shop, we did'nt see it anymore.;30.4555575757576;-88.9453060606062
