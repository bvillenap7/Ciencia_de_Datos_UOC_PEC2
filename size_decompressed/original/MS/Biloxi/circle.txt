Strange light seen in Biloxi, MS.;2009-11-06 18:00:00;5 minutes;Strange light seen in Biloxi, MS. At about 6:00 p.m. I arrived home. It was dark out and I happened to look up. I saw a large white light, larger than a star or visible planets. It seemed to zig zag at high speed and then stop. It did this for a few minutes, darting back and forth. I noticed the color change from white to a golden yellow. It then became bright red. As it changed to red, it was stationary but also appeared to get smaller. It vanished right in front of my eyes. I thought that I was going crazy and told my fiance who was at work. He called me later and told me that I wasn't going crazy. One of his co workers was asking if anyone saw the strange light and described the same thing that I had seen.;30.4555575757576;-88.9453060606062
An orange sphere of light came out of the water.  ((anonymous report));2011-01-15 21:00:00;Unsure;I saw this ufo about 8 years ago in Biloxi Mississppi.  I walked to the beach, and it was arond 9:00pm. I was squatting at the shore looking over the water.  When an orange sphere of light came out of the water.  It Rose up halfway in the sky.  And it looked like a mini sun. I watched this thing and it broke off into two.  And the second light flew amazingly fast into the sky.  I got up and went to walk away and the sphere flashed a light at me.  And the next thing I remember.  I was projectile vomiting and was sick the remainder of the night.  I walked to a waffle house.  And I used their phone to call someone to come pick me up.  The waitress said that she saw the light two.  But she said it was two hours ago.  It was at that point 11pm.  I donâ€™t know what happened that night.  But I do know what I saw and experienced. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
