Shining object released from plane?;2015-09-13 06:00:00;5 minutes;Shining object released from plane? I was watching planes fly overhead this morning when I noticed one plane in particular flying lower than the others and much faster with a thick white contrail/chemtrail behind it. It began to change course, curving to the right.  Mid-curve it appeared as if some shining object was either released from it or appeared from above it and slowly moved to the left, sometimes wavering slightly to the right and then back again to the left.  It then slowly floated up, disappearing into a cloud.  I tried to look up any similar phenomena but can't find any reports like it.;32.4329;-89.1134
