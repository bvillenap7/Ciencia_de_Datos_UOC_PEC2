Bright light over the Jackson area;2008-12-02 17:30:00;30 minutes;Bright light over the Jackson area As I was driving home during rush hour and heading east on I-20 near Ellis Ave., I noticed a very, very bright (it was the brightest white light I've ever seen that wasn't a comet/meteor/etc.)large object hanging in the night sky towards the northeast. I thought it had something to do with Jupiter and Venus lining up, but I could see that to the southwest. I could see the object most of the way home but lost it once I turned off the interstate. About 15 minutes later, I was turning down the street where I live and the object was still in the sky but had changed intensity (it looked more like a streetlight hanging over the treeline at this point). I have no idea what it could have been, but I know it wasn't a planet/star that I'm familiar with. This is the third sighting I've had in about as many weeks, and the other two objects remind me of this one, too.;32.3251090592334;-90.1873484320559
Square object in the daytime sky hovering;2012-02-21 23:00:00;3 min;Square object in the daytime sky hovering I was walking out to my car from the office and looked up at the sky because there were no clouds, it was around 12:30 PM.  I saw some birds flying overhead then noticed further away a dark object just hovering.  It looked square, no wings.  It was not a helicopter.  There was no sound.  I got into my car and watched it as I pulled out of the parking lot, then it just vanished.    It appeared to be higher up than where helicopters fly.  It was not balloons.  The color of it was a dark gray.  I was on Ridgewood Court when I saw it.;32.3251090592334;-90.1873484320559
