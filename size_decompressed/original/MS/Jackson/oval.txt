Heavenly object spotted near Jackson, Miss.;2001-03-22 18:30:00;1 minute;Heavenly object spotted near Jackson, Miss. I was traveling east on I20. Right at dusk, about 30 miles west of Jackson, I saw a beautiful circular (front) object just below the top of my winshield and pretty much over the midddle of the interstate. I would estimate it was at about 300-400 ft. There was a white star on top (lit up) and 2 colored lights on the bottom. These top & bottom lights both extended away from the circular gold surface The size was about that of a full moon. I could not tell its speed as I was doing about 75 mph, but it did not appear to be moving fast if at all. As I passed under it, the body seemed to appear much like that of a blimp or fat cigar. I did not notice the usual pointed nose in front however. The most unusual thing was the body it was glittering gold and the surface looked like fish scales.;32.3251090592334;-90.1873484320559
