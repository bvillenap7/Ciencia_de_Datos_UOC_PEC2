Initially, I thought it was an airplane with its headlights on as it turned towards me. However, it turned towards I-55 and hovered just over the trees/buildings off of the interstate. If I had been closer to the airport, I may not have paid it much attention, but I was miles from the airport for the plane to be that low. I was able to get it on my dash cam and cell phone.;32.3251090592334;-90.1873484320559
