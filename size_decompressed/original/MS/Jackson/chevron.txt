Chevron;2019-11-16 23:30:00;10 seconds;Turned on to Red Hill Circle from Terry Rd. headed east and saw what I thought at first was a plane except that it appeared to have more red lights than usual. As I watched it move from north to south it looked like a chevron shape at one point with 3 red lights making up one chevron and 3 on the other. I tried to follow and get a better look but I lost sight of it and drove around trying to see it again but no luck. I have a privates pilots license and am very familiar with airplanes. While I can't say with certainty it wasn't a plane, because it happened so fast, it certainly looked different. Very curious if anyone else in South Jackson saw it;32.3251090592334;-90.1873484320559
