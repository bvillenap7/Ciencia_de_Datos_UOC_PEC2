We spotted a large blinking white light moving in a zig-zap pattern. Approximately 9:00 P.M. Monday, March 22, 1999 my wife was leaving to pick up our daughter. When she got outside she called me to come outside as fast as I could. She pointed out a large white blinking object moving from west to east. The said that it had moved from side to side very quickly. I ran inside to retreive a pair of binoculars and spotted it again. I did observe it to dash to the south faster than any aircraft that I had ever seen. Then it zipped towards the northeast before continuing it's west to east heading.;32.3251090592334;-90.1873484320559
A light brighter than Venus, moving in an 'S' pattern, fades into the darkness of the southern sky.;2001-09-27 20:00:00;20seconds;A light brighter than Venus, moving in an 'S' pattern, fades into the darkness of the southern sky. I was out watering my plants the evening of Sept. 27th, when I noticed a bright light in the southern sky.  It was a few degrees brighter than Venus when I first noticed it.  Moving diagonally downward toward the west, it began to lose intensity.  I thought it was a shooting star at first, but then before it lost all of its light, it curved upwards and diminished.  I put the hose down and kept my eyes on the spot from which I had last seen it.  Then, approximately 5 seconds later, it reappeared as a faded point and increased in brightness until it was again the intensity I had first seen.  Its path was again in the shape of an 'S' lying on its side.  As it curved upward and began to lose its brightness, I noticed a halo around the dimming spot.  It almost looked like an object at this point, (as opposed to a star radiating light). It then disappeared and I saw nothing more. I observe the sky a lot, and I don't have an explainaion for it.  I told a friend on Saturday about what I had seen, and he mentioned hearing of a reported sighting on the Thursday night 10:00 local news.  I didn't see the report myself, so I'm afraid the only facts I have are listed above.  If there is any information on this event, I would like to find out more.;32.3251090592334;-90.1873484320559
green light moving at high rate of speed;2003-11-28 22:00:00;2 seconds;green light moving at high rate of speed Driving eastbound on I20 about 13 miles from Jackson, Mississippi at approximately 10 pm. Saw a bright green light about the size of a penny at arms lenght at it's largest moving in a east north east direction at a high rate of speed. Light moved in a direct line across the sky from directly above to the horizon appearing to dispappear from view, not go out. Total duration for light to travel this distance was approximately 2 seconds. Appeared too low and too slow to be a meteor, but too high and too fast to be a conventional aircraft. No other light other than green.;32.3251090592334;-90.1873484320559
Three lights in a triangular white ligt  formation without red flashing lights moving east to west  making no sound.;2004-01-10 18:00:00;10-15 min;Three lights in a triangular white ligt  formation without red flashing lights moving east to west  making no sound. Jackson, Mississippi near the intersection of North State Street and Presto Lane, It was a moonless sky before sunrise. At least I do not remember seeing the moon. Three white or yellowish white lights moving west to east in a triangular formation at an undeterminable altitude and velocity. There was no red flashing red light that is typically seen with aircraft at night nor was there a sound of a jet or propellor engine nor was there the choping sound of the rotary blades of a Heilocopter.  There was no apparent sound. The light formation was close enough so that if I extended my hand that the two outer lights cuold just be seen on th eouter edge of my index finger. The lack of red flashing lights is what captured my attention and inclined me to get a better look. I was indoors when I first saw it but I went out doors within less than a min of first seeing it and watched it move west disappearing into the western sky. When I got out doors It was still colse enough to still clearly make out three lights. severall mins later I saw an airplane moving in exactly the opposite direction with the typical red flashing ligt and propellor engine sound.

A Fleet Of Silent White Glowing Orbs Traveling In An Even Straight Line For 5-10  Minutes.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-03 21:00:00;5-10 MINUTES;A Fleet Of Silent White Glowing Orbs Traveling In An Even Straight Line For 5-10  Minutes. I was standing outside in my front driveway and was on the phone talking to an associate around 9pm. I looked up to the brightest star in the sky which could have been either the north star or Sirius, I am not sure, but I noticed a quiet bright white light traveling at a steady pace from west to north east. I then noticed that 3 seconds later at an even distance another light followed behind the first light in the same exact path. Then 3 seconds later another appeared, then 3 seconds later another light appeared following the others in the exact same path, the exact same distance and speed as the others. I told my associate and he laughed and said he believes me because he has seen things like that before, so I asked him to let me call him back.  I called my mother outside to look at them, and she was able to see them from a far away distance beneficially for here because she had laser eye surgery which make her able to see better far away but not so close. ! She was freaked out at them but shocked and wanted to take pictures.  I tried to shoot video and take photos with our iphones, but the lighting and aperture was so dark that everything looked unclear and distorted.  She and I  knew they were not from this earth.  She was able to see 4 of last UFO's passing through before we noticed that no more were to be seen at this location.  There was no sound the whole time.  I listened for helicopter blades and airplane engines and heard no sound.  This siting went on for about 5-10 minutes.  I was told this is called a fleet of UFO's.  They were all just one behind each other the same distance apart as a train and its following cars....very cool but very scary.;32.3251090592334;-90.1873484320559
