We suddenly saw a very bright round light hovering above us, it quickly ‘flew’ away, then zigzagged a bit. Very, very fast movements from one end of the sky to the other.  When the bright light was above us.  The colour seemed to vaguely dull. After a few more seconds, It was completely gone.;31.4283;-90.8595
