Please don't laugh at this;2005-09-06 20:00:00;approx.5or6 min;Please don't laugh at this I went out in our front yard to catch a smoke and enjoy the stars.  We live in the middle of a national forest on a high hill and have a great sky view. I spotted a small plane with its lights flashing going from west to east and then I turned to face north and saw something flashing white in the Northeast.  At first it looked like a star but it was flashing and moving toward the north-east.   At first I thought it was a satellite but (I know this sounds crazy) it was doing this kind of herky-jerky movement.  It would slow down,dip up and down zig-zag and sort of wiggle around. There were no flashing strobes or noise and it just continued in this erratic manner until it was due north and then it did this funny loop thing, straightened out and shot off at a high speed.  I am very familiar with all sorts of aircraft as I was married to an airforce man.  I can tell you, I have never seen anything like this.  In fact this thing looked so crazy I almost didn't want to send this in.  But my husband convinced me to as he told me if anybody might have seen something like this you folks would know.  I am 50,my husband is 56 and with all the Hurricane Katrina upset I certainly wouldn't be writing this if it weren't true.  I mean this thing was bizzare,it would even almost come to a complete stop and then continue on. The light it gave off was white ,it didn't flash but sort of pulsed.It looked like a star that just decided to just take off and do a strange dance.;31.4283;-90.8595
