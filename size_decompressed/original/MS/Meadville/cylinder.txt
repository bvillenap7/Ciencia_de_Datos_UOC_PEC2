2 large cylinder shaped objects seen in clear daylight;2006-02-07 16:00:00;1 minute;2 large cylinder shaped objects seen in clear daylight At 4:00 pm Feb 7th, my husband and i were putting up a television antenna. I was holding the ladder as he was on the roof. The skies were perfectly clear and you could easily see the moon to the east. I looked up and saw a large silver cylinder shaped object coming from the North-east. It looked like it was larger in the back with front being more narrow. It made no noise and glided rightover our heads. I am not sure of the altitude. I yelled to my husband to look up but he was in a precarious position and failed to see the object. I watched it as it headed south and it just vanished out of sight. Then another object just like it came from the same direction and I told my husband to hurry, hurry and look up. He saw this object as it passed over but this one headed in a easterly direction and it too just disappeared from view. I recently joined the UFO casebook forum and reported thSince you are up and runnig I also have some drawings to send to you to go along with a report I sent about 2 months ago.;31.4283;-90.8595
White cylinder shaped craft with no wings flies over Meadville MS on clear and cloudless day.;2012-11-09 16:00:00;~2 minutes;White cylinder shaped craft with no wings flies over Meadville MS on clear and cloudless day. I walked put to my car to get something, noticed what a beautiful day it was as the sky was deep blue and there were no clouds.  I looked up and saw a white cylinder shaped craft with no visible wings coming from a bit Northwest and headed dead on Eastward.  My partner was sitting on the porch and I called for him to come see.  He saw it as well and agreed it was rather strange.  It had no contrail and passed over in a fast way that didn't look like a conventional airplane.;31.4283;-90.8595
