Distant lite circular hovered briefly and then streaked away (not of this world's technology);2001-07-15 19:00:00;90 seconds;Distant lite circular hovered briefly and then streaked away (not of this world's technology) A circular craft gleaming as white as a lite hung in the sky.  Approximately 60-90 seconds into the footage being shot from my mother's video camera it streaked away very quickly.  Much faster than any craft we may be aware of.  This is not a joke I have the video I am not necessarily a believer, but until this sighting I was a non-believer.  For what it is worth I thought I would share the date and times are approximate the footage is uncomprimisably authentic and from an undeniably reliable source my mother.
