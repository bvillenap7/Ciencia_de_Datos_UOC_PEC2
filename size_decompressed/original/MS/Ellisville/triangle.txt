long triangle shaped object with lots of lights and soundless;2000-11-25 20:45:00;20 seconds;long triangle shaped object with lots of lights and soundless At about 8:45 p.m. on Thanksgiving day of last year I observed a large triangle shaped object flying directly over my home. The object was about three hundred feet above treetop level moving west to east or from my right to my left.I just happened to glance up just as the object came over the trees and watched it for about 15 or 20 seconds until it disappeared over the trees to my left. As soon as I glanced up at it ,2 lights flashed twice and just before it went out of sight an entire bank of lights flashed all the way around the object.The object made no sound at all. It was really eriee to see something so large and so silent.As far as the size of the object,the best guess I can make is about the size of an average house. If I had to make a guess, I would say aprox. 150 to 200 feet long and 75 to 100 feet wide.;31.5808;-89.2224
7 objects flying in a straight line all 7 had 3 triangular red lights.;2014-01-23 19:00:00;2 minutes;7 objects flying in a straight line all 7 had 3 triangular red lights. Walked outside around 8 pm.  It was a slient and calm night.  After about 30 seconds of being outside we heard a loud fading in and out engine sound.  Like nothing that I have heard before.  It sounded nothing like a plane or helicopter.  After hearing the sound we both looked up and seen 7 unidentified flying objects flying perfectly in a straight line.  All 7 crafts had 3 red lights in the shape of a triangle.  The crafts were also flying very slow.  I would say they were about 3,000 feet above.  Watched them passed over for about 2 minutes.  Then they vanished.;31.5808;-89.2224
