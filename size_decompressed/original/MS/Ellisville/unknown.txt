It was traveling across the sky horizontally headed northeast. As it got farther away the orange pulsating was now a white light that diapered as it went farther away. It took about 15 to 20 min. from the time we first noticed it. There wasnâ€™t any stars to be seen at that time, we were in a store parking area. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, a businessman, and we found him to be sincere and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is an excellent witness.  PD));31.5808;-89.2224
