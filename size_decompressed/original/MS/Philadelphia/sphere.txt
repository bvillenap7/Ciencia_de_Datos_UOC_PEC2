I know it wasnâ€™t a aircraft.  The object was probably 1500-2000 feet.  The object was bright white moving fast from south to north, around 10:00pm the object was not blinking.  You could see normal aircraft flying with the red and green lights around their normal cruising altitude.  It was probably visible for about ten minutes.;32.7561;-89.1156999999999
