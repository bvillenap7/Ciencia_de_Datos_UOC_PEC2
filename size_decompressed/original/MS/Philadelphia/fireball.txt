These objects would separate almost instantly ! Also we were astonished at how fast these objects would  go from extreme altitudes to tree top levels  or even lower!   As we both have always been able to debunk anything UFO related this encounter baffled us and even frightened my wife to the point that we are now firm believers in UFO's.;32.7561;-89.1156999999999
