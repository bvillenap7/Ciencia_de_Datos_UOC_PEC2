Craft seen with lights on top and bottom.;2015-12-18 17:35:00;~2 minutes;Craft seen with lights on top and bottom. December 18, 2015     Sir:  About 17:35 CST, in the Northeastern quadrant of Neshoba county, Mississippi, I witnessed a craft of unknown size for about 2 minutes.  This was a little after sundown but still there was enough light for me to see my dog about 75 yards away.  I couldn't tell the shape because of the bright lights that were situated on the top and the bottom of the craft.  I watched it hover for the period of time stated and then entered my home to call for someone else to observe.  When I again exited my home the object was gone.  The appearance of the object, as far as I could see, was as though there was a straight line with three lights on top and three lights on bottom.  As I said, the lights were very bright and prevented me seeing any detail other than what has been stated.  From my position, I was looking approximately at a 30 degree angle and the object was about Â¾  of a mile away.  After it was no longer in my view, about 7 to 10 minutes later,  a jet came from the north, heading in a southern direction.  To our NNE, about 50 miles away is Columbus Air Force Base.  To our SSE is the Meridian Naval Air Station, about the same distance.  I hope this helps. I have an MBA and a B.S. Degree in Secondary Education.  I was stationed at Redstone Arsenal, in Huntsville, Al as a meteorologist.  I used to own a Mercedes dealership.  I tell you these things to let you know that most people consider me sane.  Not that it should matter, I'm 66 years old.;32.7561;-89.1156999999999
Tic-tac looking object very high in sky, with a jet plane behind it traveling southwest over central Mississippi 2:50pm.;2018-01-21 14:50:00;4 minutes;Tic-tac looking object very high in sky, with a jet plane behind it traveling southwest over central Mississippi 2:50pm. I was standing in the drive way of my house.  I looked up and noticed a jet in the sky with a long trail of smoke coming out the rear.  Then I noticed an object about 5 inches in front of it,  I'm standing on the ground.  It looked like two tic-tacs, one in front of the other, but almost touching.  It was traveling southwest.  This object appeared higher in altitude than the jet and moving a little faster.  It looked light in color, almost white.  But once the sun hit it appeared a very shiny silver almost like an led light.;32.7561;-89.1156999999999
