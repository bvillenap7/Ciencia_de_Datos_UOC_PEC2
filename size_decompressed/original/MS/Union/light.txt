While watching for airplanes and shooting stars, two friends and I witnessed an extremely bright light appear above us and move across a portion of the sky. This object was moving faster than an aircraft but not as fast as a shooting star.  One of the witnesses had time to look out of a vehicle window when the other two individuals shouted look at that!  This object was larger and brighter than any star or planet I have ever seen.  The moon is the only thing which ever appears in the night sky which is brighter than this object.  It was a single, brilliant white light with a starburst appearance.  There were no sounds or blinking lights associated with this object. The most disturbing thing about this object was how it went away.  The light faded to black.  It appeared to fade down to nothing just like someone had turned down a dimmer switch or if this object had moved away from us at an unbelievable speed. I have observed many meteor showers and aircraft over the years and have never seen anything remotely as strange and disturbing as this object.;32.6414;-89.1136
