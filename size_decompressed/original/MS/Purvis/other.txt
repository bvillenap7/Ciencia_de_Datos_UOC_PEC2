Stars in Baton shape floated from Southwest to the North;2008-06-08 22:40:00;15-20 minutes;Stars in Baton shape floated from Southwest to the North It was around 22:40 on June 08 2008.  My wife her friend and I were in the back yard.  We were just sitting around and looking at the sky.  I noticed first what looked like two stars that stayed equally apart in the south western part of the sky.  It looked as if two stars simply had been sitting in the sky and suddenly drifted toward the north.  Both stars stayed the exact same length from each other even when they turned in the drift toward the north.  The stars seemed to dim a little as they drifted.  I know for a fact it was not an airplane.  It was too far up and it would have been huge.  It was as if a baton was floating in space.  A big baton with no center just the two bright ends.   *       *(1)  * *(2)   *(3)    *;31.1506;-89.4572
