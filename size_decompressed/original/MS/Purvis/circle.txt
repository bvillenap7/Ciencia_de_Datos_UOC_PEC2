A huge hovering circular object just above the tree lines;2021-02-16 18:00:00;5-10 seconds;A huge hovering circular object just above the tree lines On February 6th my wife and I were driving from our house and taking a shortcut on Oak Grove Road very close to Hattiesburg Mississippi. My wife was driving and it was almost dark, she asked me to look over to the left just above the tree line, and when I did I saw an absolutely huge object just hovering above the trees. I couldn't make out the entire object because of its size and how close we were, but it was huge and kind of thick with lights flashing all around it. my wife only saw lights because she didn't have time to look at it in detail due to the fact that she was driving. I've been back a couple of times to the same area and there's nothing that I could have mistaken for this.;31.1506;-89.4572
