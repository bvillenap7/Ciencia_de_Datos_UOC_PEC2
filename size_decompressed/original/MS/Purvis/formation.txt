Very dimly lit six object formation traveling north to south at extreme speeds;2004-10-31 20:55:00;2 Seconds;Very dimly lit six object formation traveling north to south at extreme speeds I was sitting outside with my wife discussing the days events and planning the next week, when from the north my eyes noticed movement.  I thought initially that it was a meteoroid as it was that dim and moving that fast.  When I focused and started tracking the movement it became clear that there were 6 distinct dots in a diamond formation very dimly lit moving at extreme speeds.  The objects traveled across my viewing area (aprox 40 degrees) in less than 2 seconds.  There was no sound.  I have no way to determine the height of the objects but they were traveling on a north to south trajectory.  I am sending sketch of formation via email.;31.1506;-89.4572
