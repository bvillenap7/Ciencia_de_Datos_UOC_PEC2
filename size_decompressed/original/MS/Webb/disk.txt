We started from Coffeville Missisippi on State Road 32 via Charleston to Webb. It was a very cold and extremely clear night. While riding we observed a large object traveling parallel to us at a speed slightly faster than we were going (approx 55 mph). This object was more turtle shaped than a saucer and large (maybe 4 or 5 times larger than our car). It was at a low altidude maybe 40 or 50 ft. It's color was a orange greenish glow. There were no windows or ports that we could determine. We observed it for approximately 5 minutes as it maintained a level path on our right side before decending into a swampy wooded area just outside of the town of Webb. We decided to tell no one and didn't for years. Later on we told this to our friends who we visited and they told us that there was another lady who also saw this object but was ridiculed when reporting it to friends.;33.9506;-90.3432
