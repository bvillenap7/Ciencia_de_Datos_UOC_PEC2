There was an after party/concert going on for riders of a MS150 tour for cure. I had donated work for the  event and was getting tired of the too loud not so good band playing. I rode my bike into the park to distance myself, bringing my dog with me to explore and get her in the woods a little.   After a while the band stopped and it was completly silent and i sat on a park table/bench and laid down on the table and stared up at the stars. My view of the sky was about 3/4 because of the tree line that i was near. My dog was about 20' away laying in the grass on guard. As i was randomly picking stars to focus on a rectangular object crossed my line of sight fairly slowly from my left to right. It wasn't directly over me but slightly lower in my sights.  Altitude was somewhere between a high flying helicopter but to low for a plane.  Each end front and rear had a large white light shining. Moved very steadily! and silent.  The sky was clear so i could see around the object, it seemed narrow from front to rear. As it flew out of my vision to my right i noticed it pass in front of stars,blocking them for a second then gone.  My impression was that it had a taller top causing it to block out those stars.
