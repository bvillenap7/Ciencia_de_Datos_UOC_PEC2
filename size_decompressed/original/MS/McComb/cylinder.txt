Ok then not using spell check because this will probly not be read. Starting december 5th I whittnessed rockets being lounched from a country town in mississippi i recorded some of them on my phone.  There has been an abnormal amount of aIR traffic in myu aera ever since .also strange lights in the sky like rainbows. a few days after the rockets started firing i started seeing little shiny things with no contrails when i ask people what they think they don't even want to look they just blow it off they don't say i'm crazy or nothing they say they don't even want to know what is going on its strange there has been no news reports or anything about the strange skys i went to jackson mississippi and i saw no air flights leaving or coming i was maybe a mile away for the air port? strange things are going on i have photos there not good ones i will try and get a better camra ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
