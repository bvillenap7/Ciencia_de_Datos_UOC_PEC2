Me and my cousin were in town late and were heading home.  About 500 feet from our houses we say a green light fly past us barely over the car.  We were able to see it for only a few seconds before it went higher and disappeared behind the woods.;31.1793037037037;-90.403862962963
Lights, bright white, about street light in elevation.;2016-05-05 22:20:00;1 minute;Lights, bright white, about street light in elevation. I witnessed 3 lights connected to an object, in a straight line. The size was no more than a yard long. The object was about street light high. I was travelling south on I55 going through McComb, Ms, at about 10:20 pm.  Near one of the freeway exits. I had my cruise control on and it went off on its own. I looked at my display an everything was ok, so I just put the control back on. Then I looked ahead and I saw a row of street lights and just to the side a light that did not fit the brightness and shape of street lights.  The lights were bright  white and as I got closer driving, it stood still in the air and it was about the middle of the road when I drove past it.  I looked at it through my windshield, they were 3 circular lights in a single line connected like 3 tennis balls.  On the same night, about 25 min later, I also saw another light near the Missisippi and Louisiana state line on the east side of I55.  It was bright white light suspended in air higher that tree level.  It was a sliver shape and not big.;31.1793037037037;-90.403862962963
