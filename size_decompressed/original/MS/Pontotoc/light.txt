Coming home from Alabama, I saw this bright light just staying in place and by us as we drove to Pontotoc, MS I first saw it in West Point, MS then my son (24 yrs) asked me what that bright light was....we watched for nearly 1 hour.  When we arrived home Iwent outside in the back facing Due West I looked for that bright light....it was no longer there..

Twice I saw a bright light in the Direct West Sky in Mississippi, then it suddenly disapeared, UFO may-be? I hope so.;2001-03-13 19:00:00;15 minutes;Twice I saw a bright light in the Direct West Sky in Mississippi, then it suddenly disapeared, UFO may-be? I hope so. Hello My name is ((name deleted)).  I live in Pontotoc, MS, we just moved here from AL in July.  Monday March 5, 2001 my husband and my son were coming home from Alabama.  It was evening and I noticed a bright light in the sky, in the West.  I first noticed it as we were going into Westpoint, MS.  I continued to see the light till we got home.  30 minutes after getting home I went out to my patio to see the light, but it was gone.  Tonight in the early eveing dark but still some light, I was sitting on my patio enjoying the nice weather, when I looked in the West sky and I saw my light again. I went and told my husband that the bright light was in the sky again.  It did not move, nor twinkle, it just stayed in the same spot as the one I saw when we were coming home on the 5th of March.  As we were watching it suddenly began moving westward then had a haze or glow all around it and began getting smaller.  Not like anything I have ever seen.  It was't a plane, that I could tell.  My sister in law saw the same light not long ago but she was coming from the west going east. She rememberd me telling her about what my son and I saw on March 5, 2001.  Since I saw it twice now and two seperate wittnesses, is this a possible UFO?  ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Perhaps a celestial body.  We are not sure.  PD));34.2147;-88.9883
White lights over Mississippi.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a flying insect??  PD));2016-09-11 07:00:00;1 hour;White Lights Over Mississippi We did not see this with our own eyes - the images showed up on my camera that I use to track deer.  I have a set of pictures that will show you that whatever it is is present between about 7:00-8:00.  Obviously it did not make noise, due to the fact that the deer were not scared away by it. Unfortunately this is all the information we have right now, but hopefully you can give me some insight on if this is actually a UFO or something else. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly a flying insect??
