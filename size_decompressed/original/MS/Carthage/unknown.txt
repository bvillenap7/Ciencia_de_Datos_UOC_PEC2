At the time I saw this object, I was 15 years of age.  I was intrigued with the night sky and loved to look at the stars.  I had been waking several times during the week around 2:00 AM and would look out at the sky from my bedroom window. My window faced the east.  I knew where each star should be. On the night I saw the object,  I saw a bright light above the trees located across a pasture in front of my house.  I knew it was not supposed to be there according to the time on the clock.  I continued to watch the bright light to see if it might be a helicopter or something like that.  The object did not move. I continued to watch the object for almost two hours.  All the other bright lights (stars and etc.) moved upward, but this light did not.  It stayed in the same position. Without any warning, the light started to move ever so slowly in a southerly direction. It continued to move very slowly and then all of a sudden it moved faster and faster and then it zoomed out of site, like a streak across the night sky and was gone. I awoke my father and told him. We went outside to look, but it was gone.  Thank goodness he believed me. That incident made me a believer in life off of earth. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.
