saw something weird on the 15th;2003-06-15 16:00:00;25 minutes;saw something weird on the 15th this is gonna sound weird.  two nights ago, i saw something in the sky.  i'm from a small town in mississippi and at first thought it was the space station.  i had heard a report or something on being able to see it.  i've seen the space station from my shaded backyard before and it was nothing of this shape, texture...glow.  it was weird though.  and now all these things are being said about one thing or another...i'm not conspiracy theorist...by the way and could frankly care less but for some reason i feel compelled to say something about what i saw.  it wasn't what i think i saw...it was what i saw.  i often look to the sky in my wanderings between unemployment and the usual day-to-monotonous-day upon which my life is centered.  and i've often searched the skies for an answer to something more great than life.  though, when i saw the sun-cloud hovering i was speechless.  i wanted to say 'over-here freakin pick me up'.  i couldn't.  i couldn't scream a word  which is not like me usually.  so think of it what you will.  today is the 17th and i would say i saw it in the southeastern sky the 15th.  carthage, mississippi is the closest town.  just kindof been on my mind.  they or it was like a really bright flashlight...except it had a flashlight behind it, a larger one....it looked like the suns corona but smaller...truthfully, i was a bit taken aback by it...;32.7852;-89.5241
