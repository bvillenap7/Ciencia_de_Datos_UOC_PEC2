TRIANGULAR SHAPED CRAFT  MAKING NO SOUND WITH 3 LIGHTS ONE ON EACH CORNER OF VEHICLE.;2001-06-18 21:30:00;10;TRIANGULAR SHAPED CRAFT  MAKING NO SOUND WITH 3 LIGHTS ONE ON EACH CORNER OF VEHICLE. WAS OUTSIDE ENJOYING THE EVENING AND SAW A TRIANGULAR SHAPED VEHICLE TRAVELING FROM EAST TO WEST APPROXIMATELY 300 FEET IN THE AIR AT A VERY SLOW AND STEADY SPEED MAKING NO SOUND AT ALL ALSO THERE WERE 3 LIGHTS ON THE VEHICLE ON ON EACH CORNER.  THERE WAS NOTHING THAT NIGHT IN THE AIR NO AIRPLANES AT ALL AND QUIET NOT A SOUND TO BE HEARD NO DOGS NO COWS NOTHING AS WE WERE OUT IN THE COUNTRY.  I WATCHED THE CRAFT UNTILL IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT. I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT SAW THE MYSTERIOUS VEHICE THAT NIGHT. I WENT INTO OUR CAMPER AND TOLD THE WIFE ABOUT IT.  THE NEXT NIGHT THE CRAFT APPEARED AGAIN AT ROUGHLY THE SAME TIME PERIOD.FOLLOWING THE SAME FLIGHT PATH AND APPROXIMATELY THE SAME HEIGHT AND SPEED. I WAS WORKING ON MY TRUCK AND HAD A SPOTLIGHT TO USE WHILE WORKING SO I SHINED THE LIGHT UP AT THE VEHICLE AND AN INTENSE BRIGHT LIGHT FROM THE CENTER OF THE VEHICLE SHOWN DOWN FOR ABOUT 3 SECONDS. ONCE AGAIN I TOLD THE WIFE ABOUT THE INCIDENT AND WHAT HAPPENED.  THE FOLLOWING NIGHT JUST LIKE CLOCK WORK THE CRAFT APPEARED AGAIN SAME DIRECTION OF FLIGHT EAST TO WEST SAME SPEED SAME HEIGHT IN THE SKY AND THIS TIME I CALLED THE WIFE OUTSIDE AND SHE TO SAW THE CRAFT.  AFTER THAT NIGHT THERE WERE NO MORE SIGHTINGS OF THE CRAFT.;32.7852;-89.5241
