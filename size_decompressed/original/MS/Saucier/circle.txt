I noticed an burnt orange color ball hovering just over the top of the trees.  ((anonymous report));2000-05-10 17:00:00;2 minutes;I was about 17 years when a friend I was sitting outside of his house talking.  His father owned a lot of land and their house was sitting in the middle of a field with a line of oak trees that stretched down their driveway around 200 yards.  Their drive way was about 100 yards from the house.  We were leaned up beside my truck talking when I noticed an burnt orange color ball hovering just over the top of the trees.  It was barely moving and I felt like it was looking at us.   It started changing colors but it was pulsing back and forth from a yellow, orange, burnt orange and it had no sound.  It looked to be about 10 ft in diameter.  I told my friend to go get his parents out of the house for more witnesses so he ran inside and I stayed to watch it.  It continued in a straight line following the driveway pulsating in color. My eyes were locked on in awe.  It then it then went to one color that blinked twice and it shot into the sky in speeds not known to man.   I watched it until it went out of sight and it was a very clear evening with no clouds.  It made me feel like the planet we live on is very small.  It was a once in a lifetime event and I have no explanation.
