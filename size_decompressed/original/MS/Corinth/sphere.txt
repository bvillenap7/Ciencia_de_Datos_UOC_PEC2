Bright orb with odd flight pattren appears, slows down, changes color, and dissolves in the night sky.;2006-10-17 20:30:00;about 1 minute;Bright orb with odd flight pattren appears, slows down, changes color, and dissolves in the night sky. Earlier in the evening, I got a phone call from my parents saying that there was something weird in the sky outside their house.  I grabbed by digital SLR and drove to their house.  The object appeared to be a sattelite and eventually disappeared behind some trees.  I couldnt capture the object with my camera. We stayed outside for a while (my mom, dad and myself) talking and observing the sky.  Suddenly, a white light with an orb shape came up from behind the trees.  It wasnt flying straight like an airplane, it was more sporatic (imagine a gnat flying through the air).  It made a sharp turn to the right, and during the turn, the light faded from white to red.  I tried to take a picture, but I couldnt get the camera to focus properly.  The object seemed to slow down a bit.  I lowered my lens, and then the object faded back to white.  Then the object seemed to just dissolve in the sky.  Afterwards, there was a lot of aircraft activity in the sky.  This included a very low flying jet and a low flying single engine plane. (At least that is my observation)  It was a very strange experence.;34.8738730769231;-88.5893192307692
