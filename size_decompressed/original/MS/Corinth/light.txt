Orange/copper light very bright then faded quickly seen in Northeast Mississippi;2012-03-31 22:10:00;4 to 5 seconds;Orange/copper light very bright then faded quickly seen in Northeast Mississippi We had been setting in our car port watching a storm roll through.  As we were setting and talking, we were talking about how it must be about over because the stars were starting to show in various openings in the clouds.  As I was looking North, at a small star at approximately two o'clock, I noticed a very bright Orange/copper colored light just below it, which was just an odd color for any stars I ever watched.  I am a star gazer, and it was approximately 3 times the size and brightness as Jupiter is right now.  Short of the moon, on a non-cloudy night, it would have easily been the brightest object in the sky.   What made this very odd to me and made me really take notice was that it was brighter on the  outside edge.  It went from a darker, still bright, center to a very bright outer edge.  It seemed reversed from a typical light that would be brightest in the middle.  It stayed brilliant for about four seconds the began to shrink and fade away to noth! ing over a short few seconds.  It did not travel in any specific direction and appeared to be completely stationary. I observed, with my wife, for about twenty more minutes but saw nothing else.  Our view became obscured at times due to broken clouds rolling through.;34.8738730769231;-88.5893192307692
Pink star UFO hovering in the trees of Corinth, MS;2016-09-13 22:20:00;35 minutes;Pink star UFO hovering in the trees of Corinth, MS Another person and I stood outside and saw a pink dot star light stationary for a moment, later move slightly at times.  It would fade downward and move up slightly. After it went into the tree line it moved up at a 45-degree angle and got brighter and landed in the tree line and under, hovered between the trees and glowed slightly brighter before it disappeared in the trees from afar where the object was sighted.  The object resembled that of a glowing star that would have a brighter glow depending on where you stood. Before disappearing into the far trees it got brighter and more whitish as if it were landing. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
