Unknown flying object over Corinth, MS.;2017-06-14 20:45:00;Still occurring;Unknown flying object over Corinth. My friend and I were watching the International Space Station pass over Corinth at 8:34 p.m. Shortly thereafter, we noticed another star like object in the sky overhead.  It continued for some time after the ISS had completely moved out of viewing.   At first we thought it might be a star, but it was moving in sweeping circular motions, then darting around eradically, speeding up and then showing down.  When it was not moving, it seemed to be stationary in one spot.  It was too far off to see the shape or size, but it was as bright as Jupiter to the south.   The GPS coordinates were approximately 34 degrees, 57', 39  N and 88 degrees, 39', 6 W.;34.8738730769231;-88.5893192307692
