Spacecraft over Gautier, Mississippi;2021-05-23 21:30:00;1 minute;Spacecraft over Gautier, Mississippi The object was very aerodynamic cylinder shape that slightly curved into a cigar shape. It had blue lights all around it and the object was of a white translucent material and it had 3 windows. When I took the photos they were moving at high rates of speed but with no sonic booms. It would stop go up and down and around at 90 degree angleâ€™s. And then it floated for about ten more seconds while moving forward and then disappeared behind the tree tops in the woods in Gautier,Ms it was pointed west and I was east of the craft. I saw the ufo in its entirety and I managed to snap some pictures of the craft. I live in an apartment building that goes outside to my patio I live on ground floor.;30.399;-88.6405
