One red light was seen in the southern sky near the ocean, it hovered the appeared to drop a bright red flash/flare object, then dimmed and travelled east a bit then another came from the west and did the same thing, then joined the first one and the both traveled south east until they dropped behind something and i could no longer see the.  Then we saw another one come from the west, repeat the same thing, and a fourth one, and repeat but when the 3rd and 4th joined they suddenly just disappeared from all sight. I took a short video with my camera but it is really jumpy because I was shaking.   What scared me the most was right before this happened, the temperature suddenly dropped a LOT out of absolute no where in a matter of seconds.;30.399;-88.6405
