While fishing late one night under the milky way, I was looking at the stars. I have always looked at the colors.. dead, white, blue white and sparkly. One of the stars appeared to be slowly moving and we verified this .. It was moving across the milky way, we figured from NW to SE... based on where we were facing. After awhile it slowed and stopped.. made a right turn and moved in that direction for a short while, then moved back to the track, continuing on till it reached straight up and then it stopped ,,waited and then a very long beam of light shone.. Then it slowly moved some more ,stopping occasionally and then another 'star' on the same path started moving toward the first one and it too had a light. The stars moved towards each other and then both turned on their lights, which touched, then they moved together where they did not move again for an hour . We stopped watching. I had the strange feeling I had been told the display was for me because I had always believed. Some years later I awoke, wide awake to see a 'star' moving in the leafless branches of a tree in the same manner of the one in Mississippi. I again felt communicated with. It again was a star, this time over Norfolk Virginia ..;30.399;-88.6405
