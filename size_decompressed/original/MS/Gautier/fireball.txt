My wife and I live together with my step daughter.  I am 46 years of age and was at my house alone.  I do not drink or smoke.   While talking on the phone on my front porch, I noticed a bright orange light in the sky.  I turned and saw what appeared to be a ball of fire in the sky right above the trees.  It was huge.  I told the person that I was talking to that I was watching a UFO.  He said, “take a picture with your phone.”   Being the extremely technologically ignorant person that I am, I couldn’t figure out how to take a picture and continue to talk to my friend.  He said hang up and take the picture, but by that time it was gone.   I told him that I missed it and that no one would believe me.  After a bit more conversing, another object appeared.  This time, off to the right of the first object.  (It may have been the same object, but this time it was oblong with four rotating orange lights.)   I told my friend that it was back. He said, “Well, hang up and take a picture!” I ran down the steps but as soon as I hung up, it was gone!   As fast as the other 2 disappeared, another oblong shaped object appeared with four rotating orange lights this time to the left of the other two.  Before I could get my phone to the picture mode, it was gone.   I don’t expect anyone to believe me, but it was a truly amazing site.;30.399;-88.6405
