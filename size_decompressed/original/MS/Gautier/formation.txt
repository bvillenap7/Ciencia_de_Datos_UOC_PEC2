Four yellow and red objects in the night sky for several hours.;2010-02-14 23:00:00;several hours;Four yellow and red objects in the night sky for several hours. On the night of 14 February, 2010, my husband and I were on our back porch and we noticed several unusual lights in the sky.  There were four objects in total, each appearing to be triangular or diamond-shaped.  They were lit yellowish white at the center and had red spots at their edges.  One object was immediately to the east.  One was immediately to the west.  The last two were to the southeast and southwest.   Around midnight a low-pitched humming noise could be heard, even within our home.  The neighborhood is generally quiet at night, so the noise was easy to hear.  This is the second time that we have seen the lights.  The previous time was the first or second Tuesday in January.   Earlier that evening, there had been a series of sonic booms that were similar to a series of sonic booms heard all along the Gulf Coast last fall.  The booms were heard over several nights.   During the initial sighting, an attempt at photographing the objects was made, but t! hey did not appear in the picture.;30.399;-88.6405
