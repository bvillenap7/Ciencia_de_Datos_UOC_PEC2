A glowing white triangle moving so fast it created a red tail behind it.;2015-06-12 00:00:00;2 seconds;A glowing white triangle moving so fast it created a red tail behind it. Moving South to North as I was looking to the East.Midnight struck as I left my friends Mother's house.  As I was leaving I glanced up at the night sky to check the cloud cover since we just had a thunderstorm in the area.  Most of the clouds had cleared but a few remained in the eastern part of the sky.  A couple of bright stars were shining through a couple of holes in the clouds.   As my eyes start to focus in at the star in one of these holes which was directly facing east.  Out of my peripheral to the right, was a upright triangle or pyramid shaped whitesh to Gray light surrounded in this bright red glow streaked across my field of vision.  It took approximately 2 seconds to travel from south to north or right to left in my field of view.  It was to long and low to have been a flare from a satellite or the INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION.  It's like it stretched.;32.1899;-90.2604000000001
