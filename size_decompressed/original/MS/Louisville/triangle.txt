Triangular UFO with one bright light at the point.;2016-10-23 19:45:00;30 minutes;Triangular UFO with one bright light at the point. I went outside to walk my dogs, and noticed a very bright star.  I live ten miles from town, so I never have street lights preventing me from seeing stars.  The brightly lit star suddenly turned orange and then red.  I quickly yelled for my mother to come out. As we are watching, it changed back to white, but dimmer.  Then a beam of white light appeared diagonally.  At that point, we were looking at a single bright light, and a beam coming down and angled to the right.  Next, a second beam came down diagonally to the left. So, it is a bright light with two beams coming down to form a triangle.  A bottom beam never appeared.  You could compare it to an upside down letter V with the bright light at the point.  We watched as it reduced back to a single light and faded out of sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.1046;-89.0259000000001
