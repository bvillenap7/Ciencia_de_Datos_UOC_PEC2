4th of July Red Orbs on Mississippi Gulf Coast;2018-07-04 20:35:00;10:00;4th of July Red Orbs on Mississippi Gulf Coast There was a fireworks show hosted by the Silver Slipper Casino just past Waveland, MS, in a section called Lakeshore.  At first, I thought it was a helicopter.  I told my son to watch the red lights because it was heading towards us (east - Bay St. Louis).  However, it stopped.  Around that time I noticed  there were two more red orbs behind it in a straight line, but with a lot of distance between them.  They started heading East again in a straight line when they just simply vanished.  No sound.  They were too far up in the sky to get any video from my iPhone.  I wouldn't have given it any thought until I mentioned it to my mom.  Before I could finish, Hey.., did you see my mom said, The three red lights in the sky? -... just weird.  But, you know, probably swamp gas or maybe flares...  There had to be a few hundred people in the general area where I was tonight, possibly more that could witness it from Slidell, LA, or Pass Christian, MS.  And, with any luck, someone with an HD camera.;30.2954;-89.3843
