It flew slowly from the north to the south, stopped, slowly pivoted 180*, and then took off very fast toward the north. It flew and hovered about 100 ft. in the air, and flew soundlessly. It measured approximately 100 ft. from corner to corner. I saw no flame or engine from the craft. The location was within 2 miles from the Jackson International Airport and a Air Force Base, but this did not look like an airplane or amy aircraft that I had ever seen. I have seen the B12 bomber up close and far away, and it was NOT that. The witnesses were myself, my husband, and our son. I was 42 at that time, and our son was 12 y/o. I have a B.S. degree in Nursing, and a M.A. degree in Marriage and Family Therapy. My husband, 45 y/o at the time, is an engineer with a B.S. degree who served 3 years in the Army, and he knows all the publically known aircraft. He is a military history buff who has studied military craft of all kinds. There were others that saw this craft as it occurred in a very public area near I-20 and a 6 lane highway.;32.2607355555555;-90.0907911111111
