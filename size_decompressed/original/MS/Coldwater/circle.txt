Glowing and shining after a few minutes, flew away slowly So it's a Thursday night and I'm just on the computer looking up information on a report, and all of a sudden, I look to them left through the glass door and there were two white, glowy balls or wat seemed to be flying objects in the sky...  I got up and began to stare and wonder. Then when I couldn't figure out what it was I ran to get my friend who was in the backroom.  I yelled for her to come and look at the objects.  She thought I was playing, but little did she know I was serious!  So she came and looked at the objects and we were scared.   So I quickly came up with the idea to video the strange objects hovering over some trees across the street from the house.  Almost two minutes while recording, one of the flying objects flew away very slowly.   Then a minute later, the other one followed.  My friend and i just stood in awe.  We were satisfied with the video.  And that led me here!!;34.6937;-89.9912
