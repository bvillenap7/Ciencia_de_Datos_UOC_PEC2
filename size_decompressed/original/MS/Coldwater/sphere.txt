Orange orbs in ms;2013-09-28 20:55:00;2 minutes;Orange orbs in ms Was headed home going down 306 and spotted 15 to 20 orange orbs coming over the tree tops headed south west.  I was on my bike and the person in front of me was driving really slow, they had to have seen them too.  I had to pull over and try to get a video of them.
