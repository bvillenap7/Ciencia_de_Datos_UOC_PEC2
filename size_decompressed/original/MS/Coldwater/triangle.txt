When all of a sudden I seen a triangle shaped object with at least 2 bright white lights on it hovering from above a little ways in front of me.  As as I drove closer, and was right underneath it, it had no sound. I figured out what it was and stumped on the gas and drove from underneath it in a hurry, it scared me being so close.  When I got to work nobody believed me though. ((NUFORC Note:  Because of another report submitted by the witness who submitted this report, we wonder whether this is a serious-minded report.
