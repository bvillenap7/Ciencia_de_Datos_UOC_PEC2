Two flying crafts seen in broad daylight.;1992-05-01 17:00:00;1 minute;Two flying crafts seen in broad daylight. I had just left work for the day and picked my daughter up from school and we were driving home when I looked up and saw a huge, circular shaped flying object that was floating at a standstill just above one of those large advertising signs.  My daughter looked at it and asked me what it was.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  Just then a second craft flew in at such a great speed and stopped instantly next to the one we were looking at.  There was a brief pause and then they both shot off and were gone just as quickly as they came.  I never reported the incident to anyone other than family members because I didn't think anyone would believe what we saw that day.
