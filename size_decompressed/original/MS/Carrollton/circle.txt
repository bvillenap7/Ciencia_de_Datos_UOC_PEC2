Round large object on Hwy 82 in Carroll County;1988-06-01 20:00:00;30 sec;Round large object on Hwy 82 in Carroll County One night, my cousin, sister and myself were on Hwy 82 between Carrollton and Greenwood when ahead of us, not even a quarter of a mile we saw this light hovering over the trees right beside the highway (which means part of the object was over the highway also). As we moved closer to the object we could not believe what we were seeing, I immediatlly asked my cousin and sister are you guys seeing what I'm seeing just to make sure I wasn't going crazy. They both were so shocked all they could do was nod their heads. We then passed directly under this object, and by now I have my head out of the window like a dog looking straight up at it this THING.  Because it was at night I couldn't tell what color it was but you could make out the shape of the object which was round and huge. Once we passed under it, I noticed it had 3 sets of lights in the shape of a circle, One set was clear, the other set was like some weired pinkish-red and the other was like a blue-green color. I also noticed as I had my head out of the window that I didn't hear a sound nor feel any wind blowing us. As we past beneath it to the other side, I took my head out of the window to look out of the back window and the object was gone, no where to be seen. I knew that was odd because we were on top of a hill and were able to see for miles and miles around, but the object had disappeared. I asked my cousin to turn around, his exact words were h_ _ l no, are you insane. We went on to our destination and have never discussed what we seen since.
