Two lightly orange glowing triangle objects;1999-04-02 22:30:00;10 seconds;Two lightly orange glowing triangle objects While looking at NGC 2024 in the Orion constellation with a pair of binoculars, I saw two triangle shaped objects appear. The objects were traveling East to West and appeared to be glowing a peach color and were about three times as wide as they were long. There was no sound or flashing lights and the objects appeared translucent. I took the binoculars from my eyes and could not see the objects. I looked through the binoculars again and could see both objects clearly. I followed the objects until I lost them behind a tree(about 10 seconds). The objects were traveling at a  high rate of speed. For a size estimate I say this, If the objects were the size of a small airplane, they would have been about three miles away. Looking the direction where I saw the objects, I see many aircraft on a flight path toward Houston,TX. These were NOT airplanes. My first thought was what the hell is that?. I have never seen anything before that I would call a UFO and could be viewed as some what of a non-believer. I'm not sure what these objects were but I know what they were not.;31.553437254902;-91.3821725490196
