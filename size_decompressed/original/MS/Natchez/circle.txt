Very bright fast moving orb(s).;2013-10-08 04:00:00;30 seconds;Very bright fast moving orb(s) I walked outside to smoke and looked up at the sky thinking how clear and bright all the stars looked the dog next door was braking I figured he saw a deer or something.  Something caught the corner of my eye and I looked I saw a goldish yellow orb rise above the tree line I was facing southwest and it move impossibly fast to the east back down behind the tree line then to the north I saw another or same one shoot up and out of sight. It all happened in line a second or two kinda hard to explain but it was very bright but not shining if that makes any sense....;31.553437254902;-91.3821725490196
