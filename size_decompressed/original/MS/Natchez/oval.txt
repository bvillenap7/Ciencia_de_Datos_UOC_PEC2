My dog barked once and settled back down on the bed.  The bright light lasted.  Only a moment and was replaced by two round bright orange ovals.  I could see the ovals through my bedroom window.  They were lined up in a straight line and appeared to be inches apart.  I wasn't scared, just very curious.   After a few minutes I fell asleep and all was well when I woke up.;31.553437254902;-91.3821725490196
