We were looking around and my husband told everyone to look at the sky.  We looked up and there was this huge circle surrounding the moon.  It almost looked as if the moon had a shadow and whatever it was was falling straight to earth.  It lasted a couple of hours and got lighter and lighter and the next day it was gone.
