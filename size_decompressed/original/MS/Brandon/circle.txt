Weird blue light over Brandon, MS.;2013-03-02 01:00:00;2 hours;Weird blue light over Brandon, MS. We were sitting on back porch  and noticed a round blue light that looked like it was falling.  But as we were watching it it moved four times from top to bottom behind a tree didn't think much about it until we saw the same thing an hour later it started off by moving in a circle pretty fast then stopped then moved from left to right, then disappeared  then came back and just hovered behind the trees about 30 minutes later it came back and went as fast as it came  please let me know if anyone has seen this;32.3515982142858;-89.9588785714287
Bluish green object, the size of a dime held at arms length traversing approximately a 10 degree path toward the southwest horizon.;2013-10-24 23:30:00;10 seconds;Bluish green object, the size of a dime held at arms length traversing approximately a 10 degree path toward the southwest horizon I witnessed a single object descend behind the distant tree-line moving from approximately 285 degrees to approximately 275 degrees before being lost behind trees.  The object was the size of a dime held at arms length and was of a mottled bluish-green color.  I observed the object for just a few seconds.  I was moving from the northeast moving toward the southwest  and was nothing like the hundreds of shooting stars and satellites I have seen over the years.  The differences were primarily the size and color of the object.;32.3515982142858;-89.9588785714287
