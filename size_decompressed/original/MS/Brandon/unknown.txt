Loud hot air balloon noise heard in the dark of night.;2008-11-12 19:23:00;2 minutes;Loud hot air balloon noise heard in the dark of night. I heard a extremely loud sound coming from the NW direction of my house.  The sound traveled SE in a matter of minutes and was not heard of again.  The noise sounded like a hot air balloon.  I am familiar with hot air ballons because I have traveled in them several times.  The sound was as loud as if I was traveling inside the basket.  I ran outside to catch a glimpse of what could be making that noise, but all that was witnessed was a form of a fast moving dark shadow traveling almost invisibly through the faint light in the dark sky. It looked as if the UFO had adapted to its surroundings and became a cloud in the night sky.  The only obvious sign that it was not a cloud was the speed of the object traveling farther away, which could not possibly be the cloud that I could see with my naked eyes.   I have had no prior experience with UFO's and would say I am a non-believer.  Until, this!;32.3515982142858;-89.9588785714287
2 strange formations of continuous red-orange, silent craft in the night sky.;2018-12-31 21:47:00;5 minutes;2 strange formations of continuous red-orange, silent craft in the night sky. My family and I observed 2 separate formations of red-orange aircraft flying what appeared to be east-northeast tract.  The formations exhibited a continuous red-orange color.  I'm former military and civilian and military aircraft typically have flashing lights while flying at night. The first formation were 3 craft that traveled the same east-northeast tract for approximately 5 minutes at different speeds before disappearing in the clouds.  The second formation were also 3 craft flying the same tract at different speeds and also disappeared in the clouds. All 6 craft did not produce any noise.  We originally thought the craft were drones however, drones can not travel that distance without losing signal.  These lights were not fireworks as firework lights do not travel that distance and then gain additional altitude after their report.;32.3515982142858;-89.9588785714287
