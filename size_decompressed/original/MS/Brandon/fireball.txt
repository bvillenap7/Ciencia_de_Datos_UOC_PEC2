I watched it for about 5 seconds thinking it was an airplane getting ready to land at the nearby airport. It was moving from east to west at what I would consider normal aircraft speed, and then all of a sudden it snapped like it was connected to a large rubberband and flew back toward the east. I was in the military for 10 years and law enforcement for 6 and I've never seen anything move that fast. It was gone and out of sight within less than a second. It was a real creepy experience.;32.3515982142858;-89.9588785714287
