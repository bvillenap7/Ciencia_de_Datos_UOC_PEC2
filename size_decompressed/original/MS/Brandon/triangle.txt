three softly glowing disks flying silently and swiftly in a triangular formation;2004-05-10 21:30:00;5 seconds;three softly glowing disks flying silently and swiftly in a triangular formation we were on our balcony waiting for evening meal to complete cooking and were just taking and looking at the stars as it was a beautiful and clear evening.  Suddenly between the trees that framed our view of sky what appeard to be three disks in a triangular formation passed above quickly above us.....can't really describe their size or altitude other than a guess but my initial impression of their size and appearance was of three softly glowing disks moving swiftly and silently in a triangular formation might have been similar in size to a large plane flying silently and swiftly 3000 or 4000 feet above us.  However the silence and swiftness and the three softly glowing disks in triangular formation bore no resemblance to any aircraft we had ever seen or heard of.  THEN THIS MORNING!....there is a photo in our morning paper(Clarion Ledger) of exactly what we saw....taken by the Mexian Air Force recently.  Check this photo out and you will see exactly what we saw.;32.3515982142858;-89.9588785714287

I traveled for approx. 400' before turning right into a church entrance where i came to a stop under a street light. The light continued traveling toward my location. When the light came whiten approx. 150-200yds of my location it banked right circling around me then proceeded to travel east, parallel with the highway.  The vehicle did not make any noise upon, during and after its approach and pass.
