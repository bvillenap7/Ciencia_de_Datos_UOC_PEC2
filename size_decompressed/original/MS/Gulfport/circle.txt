Circular shaped object in Gulfport, MS.  Appeared to have bright white lights around the 3 sides we could see.;2008-02-06 22:00:00;5 minutes;Circular shaped object in Gulfport, MS.  Appeared to have bright white lights around the 3 sides we could see. My two daughters and I were returning home after skating on 02/06/08.  As we turned onto our street we noticed a circular type open with lights on the three sides that we could see.  It was very dark, but it obviously had lights that seemed to go around the object.  It was low in the sky.  Much lower then the height at which airplanes in the area normally fly.  The object was in the sky to the  Northeast.  When we finally parked in the driveway we looked to the sky again and the object appeared to be moving toward the West.  We listened closely to for a sound, but there was none.  I would say at the time the object was about 3 houses away.  So we would have heard the sound of engines if it were an aircraft.  The object was flying very low, just above the tree tops.  At this time my daughters and I ran into the house.;30.4247206278027;-89.0820215246636
White/Bluish glwoing flying balls;2012-09-08 08:15:00;10-15 seconds;White/Bluish glwoing flying balls Two white/bluish glowing balls just appeared.  Lights remained parallel each other, then preceded to zig-zag  (kinda like playing tag with each other).  They merged into one ball floated and disappeared.  I know for a fact it was not a bird, aircraft, or a shooting star,;30.4247206278027;-89.0820215246636
Circular aircraft casting green spiral light flying north from the gulf.;2012-11-08 20:00:00;1 minute;Circular aircraft casting green spiral light flying north from the gulf. Driving on the I-10 east near the canal st exit, a circular strobing green light roughly 40 feet in diameter passed over the road.  The aircraft was moving perpendicularly to the road.  As it passed over the road the circular light strobed over the whole highway 2-3 times.   We then looked up toward the sky we saw a circular aircraft flying at an altitude of about 100-150 feet northbound.  Very hard to describe the light, but it was very bright, when we then discussed it afterward, we both drew the exact same picture.   This light had a very particular shape and pattern to it that was clear to both of us.;30.4247206278027;-89.0820215246636
Circular brilliant green light shoots straight up near I10 and Canal Rd. exit....;2014-08-28 18:45:00;10 minute;Circular brilliant green light shoots straight up near I10 and Canal Rd. exit.... I was standing on our back porch smoking last night, when I saw a flashing green/white light which was heading straight toward our home off Canal Road and Robinson Road.   As it came toward our home it went up and hovered which is truly what caught my attention as no plane that I know of here at Keesler AFB can do this maneuver without a sound.   The craft moved east then made a sharp turn then came back west..it was probably over I10 near the Canal Road Exit.  As it turned and headed back east it began to flash red..it shot straight up flashing a brilliant green and that's when I yelled for my husband to come witness what I was seeing.   We stood there watching this light which had turned red once again going back and forth..east/west...for several minutes before finally turning white and heading straight up only to disappear into a cloud.   I searched all night but never saw it again.   I'm hoping to see it this evening and hopefully get some pics of it for everyone to see.;30.4247206278027;-89.0820215246636
