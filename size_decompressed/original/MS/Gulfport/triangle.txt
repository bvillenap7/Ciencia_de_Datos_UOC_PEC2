I sent her a letter asking if she would like to file an offfical report with MUFON.  Here is details from her account. I am a forty-five year old female who has had a life-long interest in UFO's since the age of five.  On December 31, 1997 around 5:45 p.m. I was walking my dog.  On one side of the street there were lots of pine trees, but I could see through their tops. I live near the airport so I know there is constant air traffic, so I glanced up twice at an aircraft before finally taking a longer look.  The craft was like a triangle shape but each of the three sides were a different length, and the bottom of the craft was covered with blue-white lights, so it must be a UFO. I was looking at it through the trees but couldn't tell how big it was.  I started running towards a clearing to get a better look and it was like it read my mind.  As I started running all the lights on the craft went out and it was no longer in view.  Everything around was still and quiet.;30.4247206278027;-89.0820215246636
Soft red glowing object hovering n. Gulfport....guitar pick shaped.;2012-07-13 21:00:00;2 minutes;Soft red glowing object hovering n. Gulfport....guitar pick shaped. Soft red glowing guitar pick shaped aircraft cruising at a slow pace heading nw in Gulfport ms.  There was no audible exhaust and it was flying very low.  It also had a soft orange/yellow burning circular glow in the bottom, almost like it was fire burning to make it operate.  This glow also sometimes would go dim and bright again.  I've never seen anything like this and wonder if anyone else in the area saw it, because 2 people saw this last night...me and my boyfriend.  I felt it was my duty to report.;30.4247206278027;-89.0820215246636

Strange lights over large plum of smoke.;2016-09-02 18:00:00;Unknown;Strange lights over large plum of smoke. I was at dinner with my husband at a local Chilli's.  It is off a major highway here, HW 49.  On our way there, we saw a very large plum of smoke rising into the sky, like something massive was on fire.  When we arrived I noticed it was still coming up from the ground, so I took a picture and sent it to my mother, asking if she had heard on the news of anything burning.  She checked our local news website and found nothing, saying it might have been a controlled burn.  When I looked at the picture I noticed a series of strange lights hovering over the smoke.  Where we live there are no tall buildings, the tallest is 15 stories, and these lights were easily as high as some clouds.  There is an airport close to this area, but behind where I am taking the picture from.  The only thing in the area of the picture is a lot of woods and some small residential neighborhoods.  The amount of smoke that was coming up looked like it must have been coming from a massive forest fire, or something similar, it certainly isn't what you would see with a house fire.   Having lived here my entire life, I have never witnessed airplanes flying this close together, some of these lights appear to be in a triangular formation, while others just contain two lights.  There was also the absence of any blinking or red lights as most airplanes have.  If you look at the photo and zoom in, to the left of the obvious bright series of lights, there are also some duller ones visible.  I cannot readily explain what these are.  Curiously there has still been no report of anything burning, or of controlled burns in our news.;30.4247206278027;-89.0820215246636

On the way to the house right after we had turned down a secluded road surrounded by trees I saw a large triangle shaped aircraft flying in the sky just above the trees.  I alerted my friends to the object and then we couldnâ€™t see it for a second because of the angle from which we were driving and the trees because it was flying low right above the trees.  After a few more seconds we were able to see it again and then my other two friends could see it.   The object was flying low and slow paced almost as if it was flying at the same pace as the car we were in but it was big probably the size 2000 sq ft home if not bigger and there was no sound coming from it at all.  There were what appeared to be three lights close together on the edge of the craft in the middle of the side we were looking at and  appeared to be blinking lights on each corner of the side we were looking at.  We watched it for about a minute as we continued to travel to the house right when we were making a turn to get to the house we could no longer see it.  When we arrived we told the other people at the house of what we saw but they thought it was likely a military aircraft of some sort.  But we knew it was definitely not a normal aircraft.;30.4247206278027;-89.0820215246636
