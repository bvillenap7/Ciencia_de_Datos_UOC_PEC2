Bright Light in Gulf Coast Mississippi sky;2008-02-28 18:30:00;5-10 sec.;Bright Light in Gulf Coast Mississippi sky Very bright bluish-white light at about 75 degrees elevation in the southeastern sky.  I have seen many aircraft down here at night but this light was nothing like I have seen before.   Only saw light for approximately 5 seconds and then it dimmed into nothing.   There was no discernable movement.;30.4247206278027;-89.0820215246636
Persistent strange glowing star over Gulfport, Ms., each evening (first noticed February of 2012).;2012-05-19 21:00:00;a number of hours;persistent strange glowing star over Gulfport, Ms., each evening (first noticed February of 2012). For over two months now, we have observed nearly every night a bright &quotstar&quot low in the sky (in the direction of Courthouse Road -- looking from Oakwood Drive in the WoodGlen section of Gulfport. It is the first one to &quotburn through&quot on a cloudy night. It doesn't appear &quotnatural&quot and I do not believe it to be-- as it always is in the same area (starting out at early evening, each night) and by now it certainly should have changed position after this many months. It is bright as if it is generating its own light. Later on, around 10-10:15 the next time we look (it is as if the moments we look away, it decides to move) it has moved lower towards some trees from our vantage point. Within a half hour later it is behind the trees. We go in around 11 pm to go to bed and as we head in to the house, we can see it is still &quotglowing&quot behind the trees.  We have the CB base in Long Beach and Keesler Airforce base and hope it is something protecting our GULF coastline that is American engineered!;30.4247206278027;-89.0820215246636
