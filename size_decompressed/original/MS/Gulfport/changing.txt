Cluster of small red blinking lights that changed shape with each blink, no background;2003-11-06 17:50:00;4 min;cluster of small red blinking lights that changed shape with each blink, no background While driving home from work east on I10 at 5:50 pm, in Gulfport Mississippi, from the Canal exit to just before the Hwy 49 exit.  I witnessed a cluster of red blinking lights. These lights blinked on and off.  And with each blink the cluster appeared to change shape. It went from a vertical zig-zag, to an upside down v, to snake like line of red lights.  The total size of the cluster was about as wide as the interstate.  The size of each light was about the same as a red light on top of a tower.  There was no visible shadow or background. It was a misty dark evening.  The total cluster drifted from the north side of the interstate just above the tree line, to the south side, back again, then back to the south, it dipped down below the tree line, to slightly rise, to dip again.  I got to a point where the trees cleared, and could not spot it again.  Very uneventfull, but definately unidentifiable.
