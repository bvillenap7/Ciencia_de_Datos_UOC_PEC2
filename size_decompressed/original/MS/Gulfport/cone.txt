Soundless red LED/electronic like lighted bright light coming from The Gulf and heading rapidly to the east near Gulfport, Mississippi.;2013-07-30 21:00:00;5 minutes;Soundless red LED/electronic like lighted bright light coming from The Gulf and heading rapidly to the east near Gulfport, Mississippi. I was standing by our sliding door in our subdivision of WOODGLEN (Oakwood Drive) and my husband said to me what the hell is that!  I came out the house and looked to my left (south, coming from the beach/Gulf) and a led-electronic type bright red light oblong in shape that was rapidly changing various shades of red.  Absolutely NO sound.  Moving quickly to the east.  My husband thought it was a hot air balloon but it couldn't be because I use to live in Goshen, New York, where many hotair balloons flew overhead in early morning or early evening because of the updraft... and it seemed to be too late for that and there was no sound coming from the shooting flame.  I believe it wound-up being too high for a balloon by the time it headed easterly. I posted a photo of it on Facebook on my account there -- and it wouldn't show up red... just a bright blurry vivid-white light.;30.4247206278027;-89.0820215246636
