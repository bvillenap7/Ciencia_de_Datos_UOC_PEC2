A C-130 entering the Gulfport pattern flew under it.  I estimated the object’s altitude to be around 10,000’.   The object then rapidly ascended to into a hazy layer of the atmosphere, then headed north, rapidly, for about a minute.  The haze caused the object to appear as a ball, with the bright light still visible within the ball.   The object then turned east, and arced downward where it disappeared into the tree line.  No explosion was evident.   The object never made any sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));30.4247206278027;-89.0820215246636
