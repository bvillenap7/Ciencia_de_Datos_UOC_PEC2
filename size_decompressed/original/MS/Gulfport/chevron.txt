Grouped lights in sky moving fast in a configuration of a chevron or partial diamond.;1978-07-22 02:30:00;5 minutes;Grouped lights in sky moving fast in a configuration of a chevron or partial diamond. Late on the 3rd Saturday in July of 1978, I was awoken to find my sister, who was gathering her things planning on secretly going to visit her boyfriend.  I said I would awake our grandfather if she didn’t take me with her.  So we drove to what is near the downtown district of Gulfport and I waited in the back seat of the car.  My sister spend nearly an hour talking to her boyfriend on his front porch and began kissing.  Disgusted, I turned around to look outside the back window and noticed at least 9-12 (maybe more) lights flying together in a chevron/diamond shape.  I got out of the car and watched it heading towards the beach/Gulf of Mexico.  My sister comes down from the porch and asked me what I was doing and I pointed the sky, asking what the lights were.  She ran to me and looked and as I returned my eyes to the sky it was gone.  She said, jokingly that I had seen my very first UFO.  I said no it’s not.  I then began to tell my sister and her boyfriend an exper! ience I had the month before.  I have since seen this light configuration 3 times since the first time.  I cannot tell if it is a group of crafts or one big one.  I have yet to see them separate so, I assume at this point it is one craft.;30.4247206278027;-89.0820215246636
