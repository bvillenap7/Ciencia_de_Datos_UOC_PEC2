White Tic-Tac object spotted over Gulfport, MS;2020-10-20 06:45:00;3 minutes;White Tic-Tac object spotted over Gulfport, MS I was driving to work that morning enjoying the early morning sky, I saw what at first I believed to be a Vapor Trail. Being that I live on the gulf coast ,USA near many military bases, NASA research centers and airports I paid no mind. However, as I continued upon my route the object I noticed it was moving in atypical aviation patterns. I am closely familiar with aviation capabilities (known) and come from a line of pilots and military personnel. This was different from anything I had ever seen. It seemed to change altitude effortlessly with no    Trail or heat byproduct behind it. I observed it flying at an FL of  7-10 feet.. It appeared bright white throughout and had a longer body than width an almost looked like cigar with more rounded edges. I did manage to take a short video and 2 photos. The stability of the video is shaky from driving but clear.  The reason I did not think it to be a known aircraft was its ability to change direction laterally with! ease.;30.4247206278027;-89.0820215246636
