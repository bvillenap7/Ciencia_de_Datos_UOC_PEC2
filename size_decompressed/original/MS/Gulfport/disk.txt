Photographs reveal disk-shaped object and spherical object over Mississippi Gulf Coast;2001-11-05 16:30:00;Unknown;Photographs reveal disk-shaped object and spherical object over Mississippi Gulf Coast My husband and I were taking pictures at the waterfront just before sunset. We actually didn't see the two objects until we pulled up the photos on the computer. I noticed the larger, disk-shaped object almost immediately on the computer screen. When I enhanced it and enlarged it, I also found a smaller, sphere-shaped object which appeared to be farther away. We had someone who works in surveillance look at the photograph and he could tell us nothing other than it was unidentifiable and that he didn't believe it was any type of conventional aircraft.;30.4247206278027;-89.0820215246636
sitting in the woods at night with a friend i was biking with, a silver orb with a ring of different colored lights appeared;2008-07-23 22:00:00;1 hour;sitting in the woods at night with a friend i was biking with, a silver orb with a ring of different colored lights appeared Me and my friend were out at the Desoto bike trails riding mountain bikes.  When we got back to the car we were just relaxing in the air conditioning.  The car lights were acting funny and kept shutting off every now and then.  I noticed a small drop of light moving through the trees and was trying to figure out if it was a lightning bug or a plane, but I never could be sure.  This was nothing compared to what we eventually saw.  We got out of the car with our flashlights and we were just goofing around.  All of a sudden, my friend calls my attention, “come here! look! Look!”  I was completely spellbound by this object.  I kept checking myself to make sure I was not crazy and we kept reassuring each other.  I was very curious and without fear as the object swarmed around the tree tops.  My friend was yelling at me to get back in the car because he was terrified.  I don’t know what would have happened if I continued to welcome the craft.  I did not feel like it wanted to do me harm, but I just felt overwhelmed.  It seemed like the more I welcomed it, the more it moved towards me and became more noticeable.  It was an orb with a revolving disc around it that was covered in lights, and it moved without any noise, and so elegantly.  It was so intricate that it is hard to describe.  It moved in all directions, stopping and changing speed.  It even followed us out to the main road and stopped when we stopped and kept observing us.  It was the most amazing experience I have ever had.  I am not a crazy person.  I know what I saw, but I don’t know what it was.  I stared at it for long periods of time, and at one point it was in full view and it was just so unbelievable, but yet so real.  But there were more than one.  I saw three UFOs tonight.  It seemed like it was responding to me somehow.  I can’t explain it.  All I know is that my eyes and mind are open and I am a believer.  It was NOT a plane.  It was NOT a hallucination.  It was a UFO.  I don’t know what to do.  I am still in shock.;30.4247206278027;-89.0820215246636
