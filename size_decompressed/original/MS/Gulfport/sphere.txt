Object was followed shortly after by a dim red, much smaller object, traveling much faster, on almost the same course. At 05:40, 7 sept 99, my attention was drawn upwards towards the sky by bright lights that illuminated the ground.  The object was traveling due north. It was very bright (reminded me of a night shuttle launch), for several seconds, dimmed for 1 or 2 seconds and returned to it's original brightness. It dimmed out shortly after that. The object was about the diameter of a pencil, held at arms length.  The length of sighting spanned 20 - 25 degrees of sky.  I've seen space debris reentering -- this was moving slower than those and much slower than meteors. A few seconds after it disappeared, a single light crossed the sky, almost on the exact same path (5 degrees off), verred east and back onto it's original course.  The second object was a dull red color.  It was about the size of a pencil lead held at arms length.  The object maintained its color and illuminosity for the duration of the sighting.  The 2nd object crossed the sky from horizon to horizon, as if chasing the 1st object.  The Gulfport Police Dispatcher reported several citizens called it in also.;30.4247206278027;-89.0820215246636
Low flying luminous white sphere trailing white flames.;2005-07-01 00:20:00;10 seconds;Low flying luminous white sphere trailing white flames. At the time my sighting happened I worked for a local television station. I was relieved by my replacement at midnight and after grabbing a cup of coffee headed home traveling north on HWY 53. About 5 miles down the road near a old peach orchard I noticed a light coming from behind out the driver window. I turned and was very startled at what i saw.  Of course it was pitch black and distance can be hard to judge.  A object was traveling in the same direction I was and would guess it was about a quarter mile away.  It was at perhaps 3 times the height of the trees which are across a large open field.  There were no obstructions to block my view.  Out my window it appeared to be about the size of a silver dollar which if it were a quarter mile away would make it fairly large.  I would like to say it was a sphere but since i only saw one side can only guess.  It was perfectly round, white and luminous like a light bulb.  It trailed white boiling flames behind which were about two or three times the width of the object long. In the night sky it really stood out. It was going maybe two or three times as fast as i was on a parallel course and disappeared from my view when the field came to a end and the trees were once again right next to the road. I was very shakened but soon convinced myself I just didnt understand what i was seeing. Two or so miles further I made a left turn onto Cable Bridge Rd to continue home and would take me across the objects flight path. Mind you this is just after midnight and i am use to not seeing any cars much less people. Just past a elementary school i passed a small house on my right. There were perhaps 3 or 4 people in their PJ's standing in their front yard scanning the night sky. I should have stopped but was tired and continued home. I did decide i would go to the peoples home one day during regular hours and trade stories. The next day i did write everything down and am fairly good with graphic art sor! ftware so made a crude short graphic film. Unfortunatly I kept! putting off stopping to talk to the people I saw in their yard. Within a month or so hurricane Katrina hit and their home was reduced to a pile of rubble. I had no idea where they went and will always regret not hearing their story.;30.4247206278027;-89.0820215246636
Bright White light.;2013-10-30 19:30:00;9 minutes;Bright White light I was standing out on my patio I noticed what I thought was a satellite coming through, only it stopped next to a comet/star the other one took off at full speed in the opposite direction.  The main one stayed for about 3 more minutes then it took off as well then all the sudden you see a red light like a comet falling to earth.   Now with that being said On Oct 29th at this same time, I seen this same type of thing happen this object was flying lower no noise no identifiable marks no flashing lights just really bright lights like a plane  it passed over the tree's in the backyard  I followed to the other side of the tree's to watch it  I seen a red light shoot out of it and the object then disappeared only to reappear once again and vanish altogether   Clear nights  no air traffic in sight.
