Orb of light enters body, awake temporarily paralyzed, followed by prophetic visions and drawings;1978-06-24 01:00:00;5-10 minutes;Orb of light enters body, awake temporarily paralyzed, followed by prophetic visions and drawings The evening before my very first 1st incident was on the roof of my grandparents’ home playing with a ham radio and a variety of wires and electrical devices I had collected which, included a working, portable black and white television.  I would often speak on the radio pretending to be a space captain traveling the universe searching for life forms to form a galactic community.  The night became quite dark and I eventually crawled in through my bedroom window and went to sleep.  I awoke later that night at 1:00 am and looked at my clock to see what time it was and quickly noticed a light growing brighter outside my window.  I could see a glowing orb of light outside the window before the foot of my bed, from the East.  At first I thought it might have been my grandfather but, I knew my window was too high from the ground to be able to see that.   I cleared my eyes and was able to see beyond the windows that this light was moving closer to the window and noticed that the air (the space) within my room appeared to increasingly ripple in place as this orb passed through the wall and stopped before the foot of my bed.  Sitting up in my bed I could see the rippling space move closer to my body and enter, passing through me.  At that moment I felt very week, and I passed out.   The following morning I awoke to find myself paralyzed and was not until nearly an hour was I able to move and slowly crawl down the hallway to the living room and climbed up on the couch.  I was not sure what had happened, thinking I might be sick.  I was supposed to have a sleep over at a friend’s house that night and decided not to tell my mother what happened.  Later, as I was spending the night at my friend’s house I began to draw/color with crayons, pictures of what I thought the future would be like.  My friend was very into a particular science fiction film and had nearly all of the figurine toys of the movie characters and play sets.  I then began to draw pictur! es of the future films that were to come, explaining how certa! in characters would do things and new creatures we both had never seen. He disbelieved me of course but, several years later I see the next two releases of this film and everything I drew came true.  Creative coincidence or did the incident the prior night have anything to do with it?  I have had many more experiences since that night over the past 30 years.  Something happened but, not sure if it was an alien, time traveler, spiritual experience or just sleep paralysis as I have often been told.  If I could ever find that boy from 1978 I am sure he would remember that night and recall his own account of the drawings and story I had told him that night.;30.4247206278027;-89.0820215246636
Three spheres with lights underneath... all connected.  Hwy 53, Mississippi.  Turkey hunting.;2005-04-15 18:00:00;4 minutes;Three spheres with lights underneath... all connected.  Hwy 53, Mississippi.  Turkey hunting. Smelled smoke- like something was burning.   I was turkey hunting off Hwy 53.  Just before it was dark I saw a craft lift up from behind some trees.  It had 3 spheres with lights under each sphere.  They were connected in the middle.   It lifted up above the treetops and the spheres tilted and the ship slowly drifted away.  I was close enough to know I've never seen anything like this before. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

I saw a long oblong shaped craft, tilted on its side hovering with no noise moving laterally with  a lot of silver flashing lights on the outside no other colors noticed.

I always look around. And above the tree line behind my house.there was a rather large ball of light. Starting from the middle of the sky. It was white and fell to the ground it seemed. Very bright no sound around at all. It scared me. I still looked trying to figure this all out. The sky in the same direction seemed to kind of light up. Then I ran inside. But it was too quiet. Not even a bug could be heard. It was odd. I live close enough to an airport and naval base as well as airforce base but it wasnt a plane 100%. Can anyone else explain what I saw please?;30.4247206278027;-89.0820215246636
