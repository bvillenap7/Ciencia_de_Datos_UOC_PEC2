fast light in the sky;1991-01-10 02:15:00;45 min;fast light in the sky this object was at an altitude guessing 400,000 feet. it would shoot due north and reappear from due south in about 2 seconds. would make an perfect triangle. then would be stationary for a few seconds. at this point would shoot due west and appear from the east in roughly the same time. it would then make a triangle again in the opposite direction from the one before. it would repeat this in every compass direction until it had gone through the pattern of making a box with the 4 triangles. was rather interesting. have no clue as to what it was but interestingâ€¦ ((NUFORC Note:  We have requested more information from the witness, but have heard nothing back.  We suspect that the date may be approximate, if in fact the report is a serious one.  PD));32.6205;-90.0061000000001
what appeared to be a twinkling star moved quickly up at a 45 degrees then stopped and became fixed and did not move thereafter;2010-03-16 06:10:00;5 minutes;what appeared to be a twinkling star moved quickly up at a 45 degrees then stopped and became fixed and did not move thereafter I was walking out to get the morning paper at 6:10 a.m., and something caught my eye in the southwestern sky, near the horizon.  It was dark and the stars were shining brightly.  I saw two things:  the first was clearly a jet airplane, very small and moving near the horizon in a southernly direction,  but with the blinking lights there was no question it was a jet.  I then saw what I first thought was a shooting star to the west of the jet, but it was moving in a north westerly direction--kind of at a 45 degree angle--moving UP, not down.  But it did not dissipate like a shooting star, it just kept moving upwards at a 45 degree angle at a high rate of speed for somthing that small.   It looked just like a twinkling star--similar to those in the sky around it--not like the far off jet I had already seen.   It continued to move up in the western sky, then slowed and stopped.  It looked just like the other twinkling stars in the sky.   Then it just stayed t! here, fixed.  I thought it must be another jet that had ascended then turned either away from me, or towards me, and would either grow larger or disappear, as planes at night do.  But it did neither.  It just stayed there with the same twinkling intensity for about 5 minutes.  I got tired of looking at and came inside.   This twinkling thing was probably a jet, but I've never seen one just hang in the sky and not move at all.;32.6205;-90.0061000000001
