ufo - 2 big white lights - Mississippi;2005-03-11 23:20:00;45 seconds;ufo - 2 big white lights - Mississippi Me and my friend were going down the road when i jokingly said look a ufo.  Not registering that it was something like i have never seen before.  He laughed and then stopped and looked confused.   It moved fairly slow but slower than an airplane or helicopter at this height.  It was heading over the trees to the right of us with 2 big white lights.  Not regular sized lights but lights so big that they do not exist on this earth.  It headed over the road and stopped to the left in the sky no more than a 1000 ft. high.   It  completely stopped moving when we stopped to check it out.  When we completely stopped the bright white lights tured into two red lights with a yellow light in the middle.  It was too dark to see because the light just overpowed the view of any object behind it.  After ten secods it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.
