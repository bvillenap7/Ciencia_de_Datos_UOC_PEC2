Green orb object burned out in mid air and vanished.;2019-03-19 21:30:00;Mere seconds;Green orb object burned out in mid air and vanished. Me and three friends were fishing on the Ocean Springs harbor pier at Front Beach.  This pier faces south towards the Mississippi sound and into the Gulf of Mexico.  Nearby areas of interest include Keesler Air Force Base.  In which alot of airforce activity has been taking place day and night for the past few days, mainly consisting of C-130 Transport planes.  The time was around 9:30 PM as we were fishing when me and one of my friends caught a glimpse of a green orb object travelling in a west-to-east at an estimated 65 degrees south of us in the night sky from where we observed it.   The object was travelling at a high rate of speed and as it passed it appeared to be moving in a loose zig zag pattern, after it passed us it appeared to change trajectory more downwards, when suddenly what can best be described as a flame-out occured, in which the object was briefly covered in flames and appeared to burn out before vanishing in thin air.  The object made no sound and not much light reflection, no trail or exhaust was observed.;30.4402803030303;-88.7796651515151
