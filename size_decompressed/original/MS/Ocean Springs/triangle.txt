The object was triangle in shape and had two white lights in the front and several in the back.;1973-04-28 20:00:00;5 min or so;The object was triangle in shape and had two white lights in the front and several in the back. Was walking home from my cousin house around 8:00 PM when I came to the foot trail that we had used for many years. At the entrance to the trail was and still is today a security light, as I got close something told me to look up as I did I saw a triangle shape object about 12 feet or so moving very slowly North above the tree tops and making no sound what so ever. This object had two white lights on either side and appeared to be black in color as far as the size I would have to say it was huge, as I was amazed to see something that big and moving as slow as it was. I watch it for about a second or so and ran back to get my cousin. When we both got back outside we were looking at the back in, it have several very bright white light in the back maybe five or six and was still moving very slowly toward the north. We watch it for about 5 min or so until it was out of sight. We contact the local Air Force Base to enquire about what we had seen, but did not get any answers. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Dark Triangle hovering north of interstate highway;2013-09-12 20:30:00;2 minutes;Dark Triangle hovering north of interstate highway At about 0830 PM, I was driving east on Interstate 10 between Biloxi, Ms. and Pascagoula, Ms. I noticed an unusual row of lights ahead, low on the sky, and north of the interstate highway.   Since I am a helicopter pilot, I found these lights peculiar for any operating aircraft to exhibit.  These lights did not move and I quickly gained on them.  Arriving abeam, I clearly observed a dark shaped triangle, darker than the night sky.  The object was stationary, approximately 400 Feet of altitude, and less than a mile north of the highway.   Due to traffic congestion, my attention was divided and therefore I was unable to fully scrutinize this object.  Perplexed about what I had just seen, I drove on and subsequently lost sight of it.  Hindsight, I wish I had found a place to pull over for further observation.;30.4402803030303;-88.7796651515151
