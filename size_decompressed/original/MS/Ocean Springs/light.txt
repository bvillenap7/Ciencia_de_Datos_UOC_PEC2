Strange lights - NO Way a man-made craft;2009-01-22 19:10:00;3 minutes;Strange lights - NO Way a man-made craft I saw a light in the sky that wasnt very far away and it was an orange-ish color and it was small at first and then it got really big.  I said WOW, what was that?.  My Mother was driving and asked what and I said a weird light.  It went out of sight for about 30 seconds.   We turned the corner and went toward the beach when we both saw four lights in a row, the same orange-ish color(the color of a street lamp) and they slowly faded one by one like it was rotating. At first my Mom thought it was a plane but the lights completely disappeard and then reappeared instantaneously a very good distance away.  Too fast to be a man-made craft.  Then I didnt see it for a minute or so.  We drove down to the beach and I looked up and saw a small, very distant light (it was the size of the stars) in the sky which abrubtly turned around and did like a bell-shaped turn in the other direction, changed to a red color and then disappeared quickly.  It was a clear night with no clouds.  The starts were very vivid in the sky.  We've never seen anything like this and it was too coincidental to see two strange things in the sky within minutes that seemed to be relatively thousands of miles apart.;30.4402803030303;-88.7796651515151
Around 7 orange lites, 3 of which were flying in a rectangular formation.;2016-04-29 21:30:00;5 minutes;Around 7 orange lites, 3 of which were flying in a rectangular formation. Don't have much time as I'm going to bed!  Took the dogs out and saw what I initially thought were three helicopters flying in a somewhat triangular formation.  Didn't notice any flashing lites, though.  Just orangish lites probably 3 - 4 miles (estimate) to the northeast.  Objects were coming from the east.  Was curious so I went in to get my cellphone but too far away for a pic.  Saw more coming from the same direction, but not in formation.  Just one after another.  Went back in to find binoculars and viewed only one.  No flashing lites at all, just an orange light.  All objects seemed to be going in what may have been a clockwise motion.  They came from the east, rotated to the northwest, the disappeared to the north-northeast (possibly into the clouds/haze.  I'm estimating there may have been 7, but possibly more.  May not have been an alien ufo, but pretty definitely not airplanes/helicopters (also I listened for, but heard no noise).  Also, based on their flight pattern, I don't think they were Chinese lanterns and they were not falling as flares would fall.  Anyway, this is the first time I've filed a report.  (But sometime I will tell you an interesting story about a UFO in Indiana around 1982.  Includes a military conference call that included a general and some interesting comments from our control tower at Grissom AFB in Peru Indiana.);30.4402803030303;-88.7796651515151

We thought is was a drone but as it got in front of the moon, it had no outline or shadow.;30.4402803030303;-88.7796651515151
