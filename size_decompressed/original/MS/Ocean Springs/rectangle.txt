Spotted a possible UFO near a baseball field.;2013-07-18 20:50:00;5 minutes;Spotted a possible UFO near a baseball field. I was walking my dog around the baseball field that is down the road from my house.  The field is dark since it is night time of course, but as i got to walking him i looked up at the sky, there were no clouds in the vicinity and the moon was shining.    I saw what appeared to be a jetliner's lights in the sky, the regular flashing strobe lights that you see on them at night.  I looked over to what i would like to say was due east of my position when i saw the UFO. It was night so i couldn't actually see the craft, all i saw were the lights on it.  The lights were in a row, i guess the closest resembling shape of the light system would be that of a police lightbar.   There were white, amber and red lights on this light strip that i saw in the sky.  The object did not move, it was stationary in the sky, and from what i could judge it was fairly high up in altitude.;30.4402803030303;-88.7796651515151
