Very bright egg shaped object and some missing time.;1989-04-20 13:00:00;not sure exactly;Very bright egg shaped object and some missing time. In 1989, at the age of 18, I left my house to go to the store. I remember leaving the house but do not remember reaching the store. I have a hazy memory of stopping at a house along the way and going inside a dark room. The next thing i remember is that i am back in my car almost half way home on a 2 lane road. I have one hand on the steering wheel, and the other hand on the radio. I was just topping a hill or rise in the road.  I looked up from the radio and saw an egg shaped object. It was about 500 feet in front of my car and about 300 feet above the road. It made no sound and glowed like a very bright lite bulb. It was so bright I could barely see through the lite. It looked like a polished alluminum egg, about half the size of my house, with a very bright glow all the way around it. I only saw it for about 2 or 3 seconds, before it shot off to the right side of the road right above the trees. It was gone in about 1/2 a second. I have never saw anything move that fast again. I told my family when i got home but no one realy beleved me. I later went back to where i thought i had stoped at the house with the dark room but could not find it.
