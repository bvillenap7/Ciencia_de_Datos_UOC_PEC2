Tupelo woman has daylight sighting;2002-06-07 12:30:00;10 seconds;Tupelo woman has daylight sighting I was waiting at a traffic light on South Gloster street, south of Tupelo, about 1230 hours CDT when I glanced above the light at a large Chemtrail. As I observed the trail, just below it appeared a very bright sphere or disc. At first it was stationary, then moved a short distance to the east, changing to a darker shade as it moved, then just disappeared. I continued to my home where I reported the event to my husband.;34.261465;-88.707369
Strange Lights In Tupelo;2008-09-10 22:30:00;15 sec.;Strange Lights In Tupelo While we were walking our dog outside the apartments I noticed a sphere like object to the north of Tupelo traveling at a high rate of speed followed by some sort of aircraft with blinking lights trying to follow the object.  I followed it across the sky for about 10-15 sec. and then it was gone. Also noticed two weeks before a strange object in the sky to the west of Tupelo.
