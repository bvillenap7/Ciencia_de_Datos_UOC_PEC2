UFO over Tupelo, Mississippi ????;2001-06-24 13:00:00;1 hour;UFO over Tupelo, Mississippi ???? On the afternoon of (Not sure of date) I observed what appeared to me as many aircraft flying a checkerboard search pattern, or so the contrails indicated. The next thing I saw, was a single contrail going from the lower right to the upper left, only to terminate in what seemed to be a small cloud.I then observed a object that seemed to be tumbling down, but not falling strait down but on an steep angle.In about 5 seconds I realize it was a airplane. I then observed what I thought to be a single bright light above and to the left of the small cloud. It seemed to be motionless. I later called the Columbus, MS Air Force base to inquire into what had accrued, and was told nothing was happening over Tupelo, MIssissippi!...
