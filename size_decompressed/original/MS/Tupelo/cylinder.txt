Cruise type missle seen in civilian airspace;1989-08-10 14:00:00;4 sec;Cruise type missle seen in civilian airspace I was waxing my pick-up in the afternoon when I heard a slight whistling sound. Just as I looked up, I observed a long cylindrical missle-type device at approx. 600 feet. It was traveling from WNW to ESE, in a line with Columbus Air Force Base. I came in the house and drew a picture of what I had seen. It had no discernable markings and had small stabilizers near the tail. In 1991-92 during the Gulf War, I saw a Cruise Missle that looked exactly like the device I saw. I then dawned on me that a guided military device had no business in civilian airspace.;34.261465;-88.707369
