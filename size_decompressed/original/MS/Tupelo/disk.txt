Father and Daughter sees disc over Tupelo, Ms.;1973-10-08 18:30:00;4 sec;Father and Daughter sees disc over Tupelo, Ms. As I sat in my car with my small daughter in the evening at my residence in Tupelo, Ms, a disc-shaped craft was observed moving swiftly from south to north. My little daughter saw it first coming from the south and pointed it out to me, then I observed it for about 4 seconds to the east of our position. It appeared to be approx. 1000 ft. high. I was 30 years old at that time.;34.261465;-88.707369

It happened back when I was in high school. There were four of us ridding in my car down the Natchez Trace Parkway just in front of the Visitors Center. It was just getting dark out and on the tree line 75 yards ahead of us a football shaped object with no lines sort of like a teardrop but with two points. It had a green pulsating glow and a green trail of haze. It came from the east side of the tree line to the west tree line. The object was moving to slow to be a plane and we were close enought to tell the it had solid mass and the shape of a football. The size was about the size of a standard passenger car. We turned our car around and went home. I never saw the object again. ((NUFORC Note:  One of three submitted by same source.  Date is approximate.  PD));34.261465;-88.707369
