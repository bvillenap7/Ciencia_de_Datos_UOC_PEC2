Triangle shape of lights in Northwestern sky one part of Mississippi;2012-04-11 01:00:00;about 15 minutes;Triangle shape of lights in Northwestern sky one part of Mississippi I arrived home and I live in the county so pretty much dark other than a yard light, but as I was coming down the drive I saw a trianglar shape with a blue/white light at the top and green lights in each corner with yellowish lights in the middle of the triangle.  This was to the Northwest corner of my house and appeared to be over a small farm pond that is on my property about a quarter of a mile down the hill from my home.  The object just sat there, didn't move at all that I could tell and I was scared to death of this, I have looked into the night skies lots of times and my son has pointed out various things in the sky for me with his telescope and with the naked eye, but I have never seen anything like this before.  I didn't move and it didn't either, for about 15 minutes, then all at once it shot straight up and was gone from my view in a minute.  I sat there a few more minutes and then opened the garage door and drove in and quickly shut it behind me.!  I am a nurse at our local hospital so consider myself sane most of the time, and always look for logic in any situation, but this has none...logic tells me that it was not a plane or a helicopter or a planet.  I then got on the internet and found this website and then ACTUALLY called the number and spoke with a gentleman who told me to file a report which I am doing, alert the media, which I just spoke with the local PD to see if anyone else had a similar experience, all the PD wanted to know was what I was doing out that time of morning to see lights in the sky...so media stops there..really wish someone could give me a logical answer as to what it was that was in the sky last night, and hopefully tonight when I go home I will be alone, don't care to see that again!;34.261465;-88.707369
