Tupelo man  observes cigar-shaped craft;1975-07-20 20:30:00;10-12 sec;Tupelo man  observes cigar-shaped craft At approx. 8:30 Pm in the evening, I had just returned home from the grocery store. As I started into the house, for some reason, I turned and looked up into the starlit sky and caught sight of a cigar-shaped craft. My first impression was, that i was seeing a conventional aircraft fuselage, but it had no wings or tail and was completely silent. I could see round windows or portholes in the craft as it traveled from east to west. I grabbed my binoculars by the door and was able to observe the craft for another 3 seconds before it disappeared over the house.;34.261465;-88.707369
