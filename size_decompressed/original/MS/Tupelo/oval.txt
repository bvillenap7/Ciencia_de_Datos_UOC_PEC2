School Teacher observes large Oval craft near Tupelo;1972-09-15 07:00:00;03 min;School Teacher observes large Oval craft near Tupelo Driving into Tupelo early one morning on Hwy.6 approaching the Bissell community, I observed a very large oval craft just above the trees trav- eling from north to south. It was dull aluminum in color, made no sound, and left no trail. I was taking my baby daughter to daycare before going to work as a school teacher. I was terrified and pulled over to watch. The craft finally went out of sight and i resumed my journey. I called Columbus Air Force Base, and they said they were'nt interested. I had never seen such a craft before, but when i related the sighting to my family, they treated me shamefully and said i must be crazy!;34.261465;-88.707369
