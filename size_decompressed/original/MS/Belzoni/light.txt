Stood and watched it for 15-20min. until it sped away. Sped acroos the horizon at lightening speed. It happened about 12 miles from Belzoni,MS on a local road named Broad Lake Rd. The road runs east to west. Our house was located on the north side of the road. We had been attending church that evening and got to the house about 10:30pm. As we got out of the car, my mother and I spotted it at the same time. We both uttered to the others to take a look into the south to southwestern sky about 1/2 mile out where some woods were located. As we stood looking at the object it seemed to be hubbering not more that 50 feet off the top of the trees, spinning around omitting serveral bright colors. Red, Green, Blue, and White. But to me the white light seemed different. It seemed to be reaching out to us, like maybe a scan of some sort. The light was not affected by our appearance. But after about 6-8 minutes the light turned off. We were amazed at what we had seen so we stood there to see if we could see it again. After being turned off for 60 or so, seconds. The light came back on. It continued to hubber and spin in the very same position that we had first seen it, for another 5 to 8 minutes. After that, it moved towards the west at a rate of speed that I have never seen before or again since. During the duration of our expirience, we all agreed that the craft had not made a sound at all. Not even when it left. It has been a number of years since it happened and some of us have departed since. Some of us have a veige memory and some of us dont remember it at all. But, I remember it as if it happened yesterday. We never made a report of our sighting due to the fact that it was a small town and noone would believe us. And some of us didn't want that type of publicity. At this point in my life, I dont want the publicity either. But maybe someone else in the area had seen it too, and this story will help them some how. Neither me, nor any of my family members were abducted during the sighting. But we did infact see this object in the sky.;33.1827;-90.4909
