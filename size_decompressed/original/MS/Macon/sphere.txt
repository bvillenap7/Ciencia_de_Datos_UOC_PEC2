Was leaving the city of Macon Ms using Hwy 45 going North. I noticed a light to my left, turning I saw what I thought at first was a crecent moon.  It was sitting very low at a distance over the tree tops.  During the 10 mile ride home to the next town of Brooksville Ms I kept noticing what I thought was the moon then I mentioned it to my husband. We both watched as lights seemed to move rotating around it then it began to glow very bright then like a light being turned off it went black only to light up again,  much like a light show.  This went on until we reached Brooksville and got off the road.  We have traveled this road many times over the years at night but never have seen anything like this before.  We went down the same road tonight and it was dark as usual.  We know what we saw was like nothing we ever saw before but have no idea what it could have been if not a UFO.;33.1036;-88.5789
