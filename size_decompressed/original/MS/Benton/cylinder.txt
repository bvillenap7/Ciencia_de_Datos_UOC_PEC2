While driving on a country road to my deer stand something told me to look up at a very steep angle  through the wind shield. When  i looked up i saw a circle or hole open up in the clouds. This hole became very intense pink in color. Then a very large  cylinder shape thing started coming out of the pink hole.This thing or craft look to be extremely long. At that same time, this rusted bolt(is what it looked like )seperated in the middle and all sorts of windows became visible. The next instant, two things happened. All shapes and sizes of anti started appearing all over the bolt.  At that same time all shapes and sizes of smaller craft came from the bolt. It looked like a bee hive .  When i look on to the road to see where i was going and looked back to see the bolt, it was gone.;32.8158;-90.2815
