My mother told me she had awaken to go to the rest room and upon her return to bed, saw a bright light outside her window.  She said the whole yard was lit up and could not figure out why.  She got her gun and went outside.  She said she saw a large object in the sky with lights going around it vertically.  She said she watched it disappear in the sky. My mother is 79 and although my brother and others make fun of her, I believe she was telling the truth. I have never known my mother to lie and I know that sounds untrue, the woman is a saint! My question is what was it looking for and will it return?  In this area she lives in, my cell phone dies or lose a signal easily I have notices.  This is out in a rural area which would make sense as to why a ufo would want to go there and be undetected.;33.8341;-90.7225
