All 3 had this orange-white transparent glow. on the evening of Wednesday 04-01-09 at approx.  11:30 pm I was awaken for what ever reason and went outside to smoke a cigarette.   As I was looking up at the stars (which was pitch black that night with no clouds) i saw what i thought was a falling star.  Then out of nowhere there are these 3 trianguolar shaped things just above the tree lines, kind of like gliding in the air.  Too big to be a bird and too small to be a plane.  I do not know what it was I saw, they were just floating across the sky and then disappeared  without making any kind of sound what so ever.  I have the actual notes from that night.  I felt like I had an obsession with drawing the shapes and writing the details that night after i saw these 3 things.;33.0443;-89.5684
