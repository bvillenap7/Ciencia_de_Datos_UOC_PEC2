PD));2004-05-06 21:00:00;about 30 mins;It looked like a bright yellow star flickering blue and red and also emitting these blue and red lights around it. I first noticed this UFO just sitting outside talking with some friends. It looked just like a bright yellowish white star at first glance, however, i ruled this out when i noticed it was moving at different speeds.  First, it seemed as if it wasnt moving, or hovering, but then it moved suddenly to another part of the sky and hovered again.  It was very high and very very bright.   Its brightness was another thing that made me believe it wasnt a star.  I noticed that it was brighter than even the brightest of planets, however, it flickered red and blue.  It also emitted these red and blue lights away from the UFO, but these emitted lights were not as large and less intense.  After close to 30 mins the UFO had my field of view.
