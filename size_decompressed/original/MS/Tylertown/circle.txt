I inadvertently photographed what I believe was a UFO.  ((anonymous report));2007-08-24 23:48:00;15 minutes;On the night of August 24, 2007, at 11:48 p.m. I was photographing a thunderstorm. After the storm subsided, I continued to photograph the moon.  In doing so, I inadvertently photographed what I believe was a UFO.  I caught it in two images.   I didn't see it in the images until I had opened them in my computer.  There were three orbs hanging near the ground to the left of the object.  One of them broke away from the other two and moved closer toward the ground. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));31.1482;-90.1209
