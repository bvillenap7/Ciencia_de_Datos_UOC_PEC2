Fireball in the sky over Mississippi;2011-01-11 21:15:00;4 seconds;Fireball in the sky over Mississippi At about 9:15 last night I was observing the sky when out of nowhere a fiery object appeared and streaked across the sky, upon seeing the object I did hear a loud boom.  The object was on fire as it streaked across the sky after watching it my eyes were burning like if you look into the sun.  The best way to describe it: like a giant fireball.   I routinely stargaze but I have never seen anything like this.  It was kind of terrifying for a moment and I ran inside to tell my wife and we waited for an hour outside hoping it would happen again but it didnâ€™t.  When I turned on my TV this morning I saw on the news where people in my state saw the same thing.;32.3392205882353;-90.8527073529411
