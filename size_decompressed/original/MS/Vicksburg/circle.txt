I saw a large object in the clear sky On the night of Oct 2 1999. it was round and  so bright that it looked to be about 4-5 times larger than the satalite it was beside. it stayed in place for about 2 min's. all at once the light went out and there were four red lights, and it went straight up and was gone in less than 1 second.;32.3392205882353;-90.8527073529411
The Hills;2011-10-22 19:45:00;5:30min;The Hills Sitting in the frontyard my wife,brother,and I were having a little chat about football.  Stopping in the middle of my thoughts I saw what I thought was a star floating across the sky above.  Pointing it out to everybody still in a daze from realizing this couldnt be a star it hasnt dimmed.  Nor could it be a plane it wasnt blinking at all.  It was at a nice cruise then faded from a yellow lighting to something of gray or silver.Moments later the silver star disappeared behind the trees.;32.3392205882353;-90.8527073529411
