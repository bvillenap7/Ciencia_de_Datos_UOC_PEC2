Blinking lights in triangle formation over Vicksburg, leaving behind two large clouds of smoke then disappearing;2010-10-29 18:20:00;10-15 Sec.;Blinking lights in triangle formation over Vicksburg, leaving behind two large clouds of smoke then disappearing Approximately at 6:20 PM (CST) as I was driving towards Vicksburg from the Delta exit as I was approaching the bridge I saw blinking white lights on what I thought was possibly helicopters flying in formation headed SE over the river.  As I watched whatever it was it became clear it wasn’t an airplane or helicopters.  All of a sudden it (or they) seemed to stop in the sky briefly and shoot out a huge black / gray cloud of smoke then within a split second turned 180 degrees (maybe it turned before it sprayed the smoke…) and in what seemed like a second it was back over the river headed NW and once again sprayed another huge black or dark grey cloud after which the lights were gone.   Both ‘clouds’ didn’t move, they just hung there for as long as I could see as I passed under one and what I could see in my review mirror as I passed through Vicksburg.;32.3392205882353;-90.8527073529411
