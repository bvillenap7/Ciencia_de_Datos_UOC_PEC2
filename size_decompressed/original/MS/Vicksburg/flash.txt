2 bright lights moving at a high rate of speed over Vicksburg,MS;2008-04-26 20:30:00;10seconds;2 bright lights moving at a high rate of speed over Vicksburg,MS At around 8:30pm on April 26 my girlfriend and I were parking our car in downtown Vicksburg,MS to go eat when I looked up and saw a bright light, kinda like a flare a military plane shoots out to evade air to ground missles. It was approaching from the east traveling at a high rate of speed and was even leaving a bright trail as it went by. There was a low cloud cover that night and it was just below the clouds. I told my girlfriend to look and she saw it as well. When it got about even with my car it took an immediate 90deg turn to the north when and up into the clouds. At that point you could clearly see that is was not one but two(2) lights as they both dissapeared. The next morning I called the local newspaper and police dept. to see if anybody had reported seeing it as well but nobody had.;32.3392205882353;-90.8527073529411
