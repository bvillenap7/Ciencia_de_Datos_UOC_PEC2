It was about 9:00pm When i went to pick up my ex-girlfriend in Idinanola MS, from Sunflower MS. I was staying with my gradfather for the weekend so i could take her to a dance function at her school.  It was a cool night but foggy in places along the major highways and on the back roads.  On my way i see what looks to be a blue light flash across the high way.  Even though it was foggy you could not miss it, it was half a mile away but high enough to fly over the grain silos that were off in the distance.  I thought nothing more of it and went on with my bussiness.   I had picked up my ex-girlfriend and had forgotten her gift.  We still had time before we needed to be there so I drove back to my grandfathers.  On the way back however I saw the light once again but this time it flew over the right side of my car not more than 60ft off the ground.  Then it stop very suddenly, then shot off into the distance with great speed.  All i could see was a blue light however when this light traveled it was as if it were a cylinder shape.   This time it really bugged me and to make sure i was losing it i ask my ex-girlfriend if she saw it. She said yes. We arrived at my grandfathers house and told him what we saw.  He had also seen somethinng from out side his front window.  I asked him what color it was and he said blue, and it moved very fast.  He also said that it wasn't the first time he's seen something like that.  He had seen this before twice as a child and three time growing up.;33.5601;-90.5428
