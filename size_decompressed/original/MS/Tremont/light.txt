As soon as it came it all of a sudden stopped. To start with I must explain that myself and my wife have a fan and our daughters baby swing on all night and they both create a loud and constant noise. Basically normally we don't hear anything outside unless a car drives right by the house or a fighter jet from columbus airforce flys by (maybe once aday but normally in the afternoon). We were woken up about 4:30 a.m by what at first we thought was a helicopter hovering above our house. However rather then the sound of blades cutting through the air in a high pitched manner, this was a low droning noise, but very loud. it stayed above our house for about 2-3 mins before I was fully awake and looked outside. My wife and I were greated with a light hoovering above a building on our land and then as I went outside to take a closer look it vanished. If there is anyone who knows of anyway we could shed some light on this rather strange incedent we would sleep much better.;34.2367;-88.2406
