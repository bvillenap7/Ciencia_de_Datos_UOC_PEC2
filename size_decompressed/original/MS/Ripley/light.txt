After a few minutes it streaked off as if it where the speed of light. My wife, her brother, and I were standing outside of our home when we saw what looked like a star. It was motionless at first and then it slowly started moving. I told my wife it was just a satellite or aircraft. After I said that the object took off. It streaked across the the sky faster than any man-made aircraft. Just guessing I would say it was going about 10 or 20 thousand miles per hour. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
