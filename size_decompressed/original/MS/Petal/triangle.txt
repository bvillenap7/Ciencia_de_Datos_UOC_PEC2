At 23:12 on 10/26/99  I went outside for some nite air..To the South, I notice a very bright series of lights that was approaching from the south, northbound.....I first thought it was a large jet coming in to Hattiesburg..Then I realized this was something very different...I called my two sons outside..Ages 25, and 19..We all were stund as the craft stop for a brief hover, then continued to move north toward Laurel (20miles North) As it passed over our house, there was NO sound at all! It made very small quick action heading changes a few times, no more than a few deg's though as it continued north. Object had a series of white lights in diamond formation pointing down, with one VERY strong strobe type light to the rear...All lights were white. The whole craft look as if trianglar the size of a DC 10....No noise was detectable, and moved to slowly to keep a conventinal aircraft airborne Although I've been inactive for a longtime, I do hold a Com. Pilots ticket and can tell you this object was very very strange.....;31.3443;-89.2189
