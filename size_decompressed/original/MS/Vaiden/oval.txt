My grandparents live in the middle of nowhere in Vaiden, Mississippi. They’re neighbors live at least 10 acres away from them and their house is surrounded by dense woods.  We were outside looking at the stars after having a bonfire. It was about 8:30-9:30 pm and extremely dark outside.  We were looking at the sky and my sister suddenly got really quiet and pointed at this object that was very close to us.  It was an oval shape with about 6 lights around the exterior.  It flew above the tree line, and moved back and forth in the sky, and eventually took off behind the trees.  Some of the lights were blue, orange, and red.  A couple of years earlier, we went to my grandparents house, and we saw the exact same object fly past our car window on the way home at about 9:00 pm.  We stood there shocked, especially me because I saw the same object and it left me with the s! ame feeling.  I hope this organization can look over this encounter and take this message seriously.  I’ve always been fascinated by extraterrestrials and science, but I truly cannot find an explanation for this occurrence.  Please review this information to be used for future cases with UFOs, thank you.;33.3311;-89.7571
