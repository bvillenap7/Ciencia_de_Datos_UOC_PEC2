Saw cigar shaped object in Carroll county mississippi;1995-02-15 07:30:00;5 minutes;Saw cigar shaped object in Carroll county mississippi It has been a good ten years since i saw this object-my daughter actually spotted it first.  Let me back up and say that she was only about 7 years old at the time and I had recently given her a silver baton as one of her birthday presents which falls on Valentines day.  Well, I was on my way, taking her to school early one morning not far from where we live and i had noticed she was being exceptionally quiet and staring intently out of the front windshield of my blazer.  I said , honey, what are you looking at, and she said, mommy, theres a baton in the sky.  I said what and looked in the direction that had her attention-and I saw this -perfect cigar shaped metallic looking object just above tree top level.  I immediatedly pulled my truck over and got out.  I was mesmerized. I probably just stood there a couple of minutes just watching this object-and if i had to estimate, it was probably the size of a large automobile more pewter in color than silver.  I never saw it move. I heard absolutely no sound, no lights, not anything, other than the fact that it was hovering just above the trees, and was extrememly close to us.  After watching it in awe, I suddenly got scared and jumped back in my vehicle and left-when I looked back I could no klonger see the object.  This is my first, only, and last time that I will report this sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));33.3311;-89.7571
