Silent metallic sphere spotted by two in skies east of Nettleton, Mississippi.;2014-11-15 22:45:00;15 seconds;Silent metallic sphere spotted by two in skies east of Nettleton, Mississippi. My girlfriend and were in the driveway looking at the stars as we often do when a silver colored sphere came out of the east.  It looked like a shiny metal marble.  The object was low enough for me to see light reflecting on its surface.  It was totally silent and moved at a slow speed.  When it got almost directly over my position it made a very smooth and very perfect 90Â° turn to the north.  Not at all like the turning of an airplane. Just a sudden, very smooth change of direction.   At this point it was heading away from me so I positioned myself and my girlfriend to where we could see it when it was to pass underneath some very high clouds.  I had a very distinct feeling that it was aware of being watched.  It was at that time that it faded into invisibility.  Not a sudden vanishing but rather a two second fade into thin air going from a solid object to see-through to invisible.   During the entire incident my girlfriend and I didn't speak a word to one another.  When it was over I asked her to tell me what she just saw and her account was exactly the same as mine.  That in itself lends credibility to the sighting.  @ ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));34.0792;-88.6078
