I was driving west towards home. It was dusky dark and the road I was on has two sharp curves the first is to the left and as I turned the curve I noticed a red light coming straight up from a tree line in the east. At first I thought it was an antenna tower from the hills in that direction because it was flashing slowly, bright to dim and back again. It looked as if it were at least a mile away so I didn’t think much of it but it kept getting higher so I stopped my truck and watched. The light first came straight up then it went northwest. It dimmed and changed from red to white dimmed and then changed red again. From the moment it change direction it started moving faster, at first I thought it was a plane but it ended up going much to fast for a plane. It dimmed and it just blinked out. I sat there for a minute trying to figure out what I saw, then two jets flying staggered but side by side came from the same direction as the light did and disappeared behind the hill. It really started to make me wonder what I had seen. The light didn’t disappear behind the hill it just disappeared. Then I seen the two jets fly over and I could follow them the whole way.  The jets appeared just only a minute after I seen the light. I got freaked out and went to my house got my mother and took her to were I saw the light and told her what I had seen. That was the end of that and I haven’t seen anything like it since. I’ve told a couple of people since but no one believes me.;34.0792;-88.6078
