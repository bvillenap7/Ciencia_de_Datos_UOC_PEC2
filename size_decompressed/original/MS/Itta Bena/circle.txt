It was one fall night when my boyfriend and I decided to ride around the campus of the college we were attending.  We decided to park so that we could talk and listen to music when we noticed this ball of light which looked somewhat gold in tone drop down from out of the dark star lit sky. At first we thought it was a huge falling star but it came to an instant stop like nothing we had ever seen before. Then all of a sudden it moved horozontally to the south so fast and came to an instant stop. We both looked at eachother with our mouths opened and asked eachother, did you see that? We both said yes and were afraid that the other one would say saw what. But as we looked the object went straight up like a shot and disappeared. But as fast as it disappeared it reappeared and moved from north to south like no other craft we had ever seen. The color of the object seemed to grow in intensity instantly changing from a dim hew to a bright hew of gold. At that moment we felt fear and decided to leave and say nothing thinking noone would believe us.  I am positive that UFO's exist. And I know that the guy I was with that night will back me up.
