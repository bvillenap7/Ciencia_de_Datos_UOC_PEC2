Orange Glowing Half Oval Shaped UFO;2021-01-18 23:00:00;10 minutes;Orange Glowing Half Oval Shaped UFO I was leaving my house and saw a bright orange object behind trees that looked like the bottom half of moon lit up.  I drove through town and continued seeing it behind trees.  I reached a clearing inside the city at a parking lot where I could clearly see the object.  It was a glowing oval shape with the bottom half lit up in bright orange.  Smooth.  It was perfect half oval.  After seeing it clearly, it broke up in to “dust/particles” and started floating away before quickly disappearing.;31.8488;-89.7496
