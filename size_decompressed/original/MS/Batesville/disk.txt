UFO seen trailing Aircraft.;2014-07-04 20:15:00;5 minutes;UFO seen trailing Aircraft On the evening of July 4th, 2014, I was sitting on the steps to our home, when I noticed a jet coming across the sky.  The time was around 8:16 PM (I made a point to look at my watch).  I watched the jet and the small white traill of condensation left behind it. It was extremely clear outside and I seen the jet coming along ways before it finallly passed over.  The direction it flew from was WSW to NE.  Illustrationally speaking for a mental image, a flight path from Dallas, Texas, to New York City. As the jet neared closer, I noticed an odd object behind it.  I didn't think much of it until it got closer.  The jet didn't pass directly over me, it probably was (roughly) an eighth of a mile South. As it got closer to passing over, I noticed the object trailing about (roughly) a half mile behind it, on the exact same path, flying at about the same speed.  I was in T- Total shock! I watched both the jet and then the silver/grey disk-shaped object fly of towards the North-East.  Nothing abnormal happened, no erratic movements, no lights, and no sound.  By the time they were out of sight, my watch read 8:22 PM. The disc was about 3/4s the size of the jet, including wingspan.  Nothing very outstanding was noticed, other than it appeared seamless.  Also, it appeared at a slightly higher altitude than the jet. It's worth noting that this is the THIRD UFO visualization I've had since moving to Batesville a few years ago, but the first daytime/evening visualization.  The previous two occurred at night after 10PM.   I have got mysterious lights on video both times previously.  Unfortunately, I didn't have my camera where I could put my hands on it, and did not want to move from watching the phenomenon before me.;34.3115;-89.9443000000001
