Diamond shaped, lighted objects hovering near microwave tower..;1992-01-31 19:00:00;3 hours;Diamond shaped, lighted objects hovering near microwave tower. Date is approximate.  We first witnessed a diamond shaped craft hovering very close to a tall microwave tower east of Batesville, Mississippi.  Viewing it through binoculars, I was able to make out an array of red, green, blue, and yellow lights that seemed to be pulsing more than flashing.   After a few minutes, the object was joined by a second one, which also hovered near the tower for a while.  They then accelerated east across the sky at a speed faster than anything I’ve ever witnessed...  I would estimate they flew from one end of the sky to the other in less than two or three seconds.   I waited outside, hoping and, oddly, expecting, that they would return, and a couple hours later, three of them appeared from the east, as quickly as the first two had exited in that direction, and stopped suddenly near the tower again, hovering for a while before returning east.   I’ve thought about this event many times since then, and I’ve remembered it in great detail.  One thing that would help pinpoint the date is the fact that the weather report on the 10:00 PM news of Memphis station WMC mentioned “a lot of UFO sightings around the mid south tonight”.  I’ve tried to find transcripts of the news and haven’t had any luck. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Thanks for the follow up.  The sighting state was actually Mississippi, and I live in Oregon now.  It’s possible I mistyped in the form, so my apologies.  I’ll get back to you if I remember more, but one thing that I’ll note is that it was dark when I first saw them, and I remember being outside for three hours.  The news aired at 10:00 PM, so sunset that day was quite early (before 7).  This would indicate a winter month, and I’m thinking probably January or February of 1992.  Thanks again!;34.3115;-89.9443000000001
