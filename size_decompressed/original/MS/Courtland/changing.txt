On the first night I noticed that there was a real bright star above my house and it looked as if maybe was barely twinkling then.  I kept a watch on it and it never moved but was really bright.   Well on the 4th night I went outside and was staring at it and then that's when it split apart into the 3 sections with red blinking lights on each end of it.  It turned and twisted and then a whole bunch of rainbow colors exploded out of it and it made a design pattern with the lights for about 30 seconds then the colors went away and then it came back into a round looking bright star then just slowly went away.
