My girlfriend and I were stargazing pretty far out of town, so we could see as much of the night sky as possible. After about an hour, she noticed what appeared to be a very bright star that was wobbling towards the south (through a bit of a treeline).  I watched it for about 30 minutes as it moved in all directions and in circles.  Without knowing how far away it was, it would be difficult to know how fast it was going, but if I held a dime out at arms length it would almost cover the area it moved around.;34.6451;-88.8067
