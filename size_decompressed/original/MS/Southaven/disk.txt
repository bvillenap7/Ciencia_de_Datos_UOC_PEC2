My Grandmother and I were returning from the Walgreens on Hwy 51 at Bullfrog Corner.  We traveled south on Hwy 51 to the four way stop at the intersection of Church Rd. and Hwy 51. As we traveled south from Bullfrog Corner, I noticed a strange shiny light in the sky. The disk, metalic, moved from right to left, like a bee dancing. I watched for a few minutes to make sure. I informed my Grandmother, because I was that sure it wasn't a plane. She could not figure out what it was either. It moved in a southernly direction for a second. A green plane moved through the sky beneath the disk. The unidentifed object moved closer and then disappeared in the direstion of the plane. Down Church Road in that direction, in the woods, are large radar dishes fenced off from the road. A small airfield is at the end of the road.;34.9641542857143;-89.9764985714285
Disc Shape Hovering in Southaven MS;2009-06-25 20:18:00;10 minutes;Disc Shape Hovering in Southaven MS One object that appeared black at first hovered above a neighborhood.  It was too low to be a plane but too high to be a remote control object.  It floated in one place for about 3-4 minutes.   We went home and got a camera and it was floating in the same area.  It then started traveling north. We tracked along side it at approx 30 mph till it took a west turn. It again staid hovering and we were able to snap three pictures.    As I took the pictures my camera did something strange and had an orbital glow in the lcd screen before the picture snapped.  It was also slow to respond.  This is not normal for the camera operation and I wasn't using a flash.   We followed around for a few minutes more as it tracked northwest across our neighborhood.  We tried to turn around and get a better spot to caputre video.  As we turned around it disappeared.  We drove a 1 mile square area looking for it but it was gone.   The weather was perfect.  Very few clouds all which were high.;34.9641542857143;-89.9764985714285
