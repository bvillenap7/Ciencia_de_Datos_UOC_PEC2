Increasing in number and communicating with patterns.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sightings of stars??  PD));2017-07-10 22:00:00;>3 months;Bright pulsating lights with rotating colors (violet, blue, white).  Began appearing 3 months ago in NW Sky, 45 deg or less from horizon.  Now there are 5+, all located at same deg from horizon, 4 do not seem to move and seem to make a pattern in sky.  2 in W sky and 2 in E sky.  There are 3 evenly-spaced lights (not as bright) running vertically exactly between the 2 in the E sky.  Seems to mimic Belt of Orion – Most witnesses tell me, “That is the Big Dipper”.  These 5 lights line up like a cross, exactly evenly spaced with the 2 on either side pulsating brightness w rotating colors.  First noticed this pattern one week ago and I am looking every night for last 3 months, so I believe they are increasing in number and communicating with patterns.  Arcturus and Serpens, I believe, are located in our E sky at a higher degree.  I have evidence.;34.9641542857143;-89.9764985714285
