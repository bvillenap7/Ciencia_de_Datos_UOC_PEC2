5 BRIGHT WHITE ORBS THAT CHANGED IN FORMATION;2009-01-09 17:45:00;20 minutes;5 BRIGHT WHITE ORBS THAT CHANGED IN FORMATION At the same exact time my daughter and I witnessed 5 radiating white/bright orbs of light in a formation in the north sky towards Memphis while we drove North on Airways Blvd. They first were vertical and stacked, slowly separating into a line with much more space between them. Then formed into V. We watched this for 20 minutes and tried to call our local news station from cell phones after looking up their numbers. I finally emailed one of the Memphis stations just to see if anyone else saw what we were seeing. I haven't heard anything back. It was something I've never seen. My daughter is 14 and it scared her. I am more amazed than anything. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.9641542857143;-89.9764985714285
