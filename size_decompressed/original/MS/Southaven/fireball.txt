Hovering red object(s) nightly along with triangular forming white orbs;2015-08-20 21:00:00;3-4 hours;Hovering red object(s) nightly along with triangular forming white orbs Events have been occurring nightly.  Strange multiple pulsaiting red 'orb like' flickering lights in night sky.  Object hovers for hours along with white orb specs in triangle form all over night sky and I am certain its not stars I'm seeing.  Too close in atmosphere to be stars, especially when they are moving in form.  Exciting and creepy at the same time.   I'm sick of our U.S government lying to the people and I know something sinister is happening.  Beware of deception for I know they are not our friends.

I was standing in the parking lot of the Southaven, Mississippi Library as this happened,  my observation was 1-1/2 to 2 seconds as the object disappeared  This to me may have been a meteor or a burning left over part of satellite. No other object or unusual thing was seen after this by me. This concludes my report. Thanks B C;34.9641542857143;-89.9764985714285
