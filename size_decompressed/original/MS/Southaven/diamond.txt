Southaven MS triangular UFO;2020-11-07 11:30:00;1-2 minutes;Southaven MS triangular UFO I was heading west down a main road during a motorcycle ride.  The group had 2 other riders.  We were stopped at a light and about to turn North. As I was riding I noticed a object in the left corner of the horizon. It was very reflective or maybe they were lights, at first I thought it may be a small plane like a Cessna or piper since the sky was very clear today, but the object was barely moving horizontally and it seemed fairly low given I could see the bottom of the object. It was maybe around 6500 to 10,000 ft. There were altocumulus clouds in the sky and those are usually below 20,000 ft. The object suddenly zipped up vertically at an extremely high rate of speed. Within 3-5 seconds the object was completely gone. The other riders and I looked at each other in disbelief. We werenâ€™t sure if our eyes were playing tricks on us or if we had seen a ufo or not.;34.9641542857143;-89.9764985714285
