A circle of light;2001-03-08 20:00:00;baseball game;A circle of light My friend and I were walking around at a thursday night baseball game.  I was fixing to leave when I looked up and notice a light in the sky.  I thought at first that it was a star but I notice that it was kind of cloudy and you wouldn't be able to see any stars that night. I told my friend to take a look he just said it was porbably just a plane.  But it just stayed in that one spot for at least 5 to 10 min. Then it started to move in an upward movement and gradually picked up speed intill it was out of site. I don't know much about planes but from the ones I've seen they have more than just one light on them and they have on e that flashes. The object I saw was just a circle of light.;30.8648;-88.6503
