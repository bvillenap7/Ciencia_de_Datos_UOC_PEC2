T;2016-06-09 01:00:00;10 minutes;was setting on my porch last night with my daughter and wife when we heard a very loud aircraft sound to the north and then silent.   the sound was so close it made our windows shake.   I stepped off into the yard and by this time the sound was gone but i spotted 3 lights flashing  hovering i would say about 1000 feet above me.   i called my daughter and my wife over to see them flashing and the lights started to split apart and to of them moved to the left of us in the sky as one of them started moving in an unnatural way the other one started blinking bright random colors and then shot off very fast.   shortly after the dogs around our neighborhood started barking like crazy.;30.8648;-88.6503
