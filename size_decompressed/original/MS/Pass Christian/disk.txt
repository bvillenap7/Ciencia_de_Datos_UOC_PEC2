WELL I AM JUST AN EVERYDAY MOM. I GO TO WORK AT CITY HALL I COME FROM WORK PICK UP MY CHILD AND MY HUSBAND AND I GO HOME HOME EVERY DAY SAME ROUTINE. NOTHING STRANGE UNTIL YESTERDAY ON OUR WAY HOME WE WERE APPROXIMATELY 1/3 OF A MILE FROM OUR DRIVEWAY WHICH IS NORTH OF THE INTERSTATE IN A SPARSLEY POPULATED AREA, DIRECTLY TO THE NORTH OF THE INTERSTATE I NOTICED A LINE OF FLASHING RED LIGHTS ALL IN A ROW TO CLOSE TO BE PLANES OR HELICOPTERS BUT AS I GOT CLOSER I STARTING YELLING TO MY HUSBAND IN THE PASSENGERS SEAT  DO YOU SEE THAT? WHAT IS IT? HE SAID I CANT BELIEVE IT SPEED UP LETS FOLLOW IT SO I CONTINUED NORTH BUT THE OBJECT REMAINED STILL DIRECTLY ABOVE THE TREE LINE RIGHT BELOW THE CLOUDS ALMOST HOVERING I WOULD SAY. I STOPPED THE CAR AND WE GOT OUT THE OBJECT SEEMED CLOSE ENOUGH TO TOUCH  BUT IT WAS STILL ATOP THE TREES WHERE IT REMAINED IT WAS BIGGER THAN A HOUSE AND IT SEEMED AS IF IT WERE SPINNING BUT IT WASNT MOVING IT ALSO HAD LIGHTS ON THE BOTTOM SIDE BUT THEY WERE WHITE NOT RED AND SHINED BRIGHTLY I WAS HORRIFIED AT WHAT I HAD SAW SO I GOT BACK IN THE CAR. MY HUSBAND DECIDED WE SHOULD FOLLOW THE OBJECT SO WE DID. THE OBJECT CONTINUED TO MOVE EASTERLY DIRECTLY ALONG SIDE OF THE INTERSTATE FOR SEVERAL MILES, I FOLLOWED AS LONG AS I COULD AT APPROXIMATELY 85 MPH BUT AS DARKNESS BEGAN TO FALL I DECIDED TO TURN AROUND AND GO HOME THE OBJECT CONTINUED TOWARDS THE EAST AND DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT. I WOULD NEVER HAD BELIEVED WHAT I SAW BUT I SAW IT AND NOW I THINK OTHER PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW. I AM JUST AN EVERY DAY JOE SO THESE THINGS REALLY ARE OUT THERE. WHAT THEY ARE OR WHERE THEY COME FROM WHO KNOWS. I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD SHARE WITH A FEW PEOPLE WHIO MIGHT BE INTERESTED. NOW I AM PICKED ON BY FAMILY AND FRIENDS BUT I SAW WHAT I SAW AND I'LL NEVER FORGET IT.;30.3943;-89.287
