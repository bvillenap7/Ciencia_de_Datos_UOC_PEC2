My husband and I were pulling into our drive-way last night at about 7:45p.m. and we saw a bright-green ball of light that seemed to be coming from north of New Orleans descending to the earth at a very high speed. This object had to have landed either somewhere on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi or in the Gulf of Mexico near the beach. The object was definitely in our atmosphere and was moving quickly with no tail or trail of light behind it. I would love to know what it was.;30.3943;-89.287
GREEN FIREBALL.;2014-08-15 22:00:00;1 minute;WE SAW A GREEN FIREBALL PASS OVER OUR HOUSE.  IT CAME FROM THE WEST AND HEADED EASTWARD IT APPEARED TO FLOAT ACROSS THE SKY.   THE NEXT NIGHT, WHILE RIDING HORSES TOWARD THE RIVER, WE SAW THE SAME FIREBALL ABOVE THE TREE LINE IN THE SKY MOVING EAST TO WEST. ((NUFORC Note:  Most green fireballs, we suspect, are meteors, i.e. rocks coming in at high velocity from space, containing copper, which incandesces green.  However, if the witness's estimate of the duration is anywhere close to being accurate, the object, almost certainly, was not a meteor.  A one-minute sighting is too long for the overwhelming majority of meteors, and probably all of them.
