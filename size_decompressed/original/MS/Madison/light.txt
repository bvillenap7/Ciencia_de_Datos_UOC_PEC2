A formation of flashing lights hovering high in the air.;2019-10-17 03:00:00;1 hour;A formation of flashing lights hovering high in the air. I looked out my window very late last night and saw an odd pattern of 3 flashing lights in the distance. I couldn't make out the exact shape because it was so far away. It was hovering in the air for a long time and making very small irregular movements. It didn't appear to be a satellite, as it moved back and forth. It might have been a drone, however it was very very high up. The lights flashed and appeared mostly white. Occasionally reddish, blueish, and greenish. I probably could have gone outside for a better look, but I was a bit spooked. I couldn't get a good picture of it. It hovered for a long time and gradually moved to the west. It had kinda a glow / aura around it.;32.4699;-90.1101999999997
