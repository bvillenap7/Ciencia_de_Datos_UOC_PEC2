((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides a minimum of information, so we can only guess at what he might have witnessed.  However, We wonder whether he might have been observing a so-called twinkling star, and possibly the star, Sirius.  We don't know what time Sirius might have risen above the southeast horizon, in the area where the sighting occurred.  PD));32.4699;-90.1101999999997
Red, spherical lights moving slowly in the sky.;2015-12-17 18:50:00;7 minutes;Red, spherical lights moving slowly in the sky. The lead mechanic for ((deleted)) in Madison, MS, came inside the FBO and requested that all the employees on staff step outside to witness the objects.  We initially saw five, red, spherical objects in the western sky traveling southbound at a rapid but steady pace.  (The objects were approximately two hand widths vertical distance from ground level). The red light on the objects was not blinking.  All of the objects began to disappear (their red lights faded slowly, as if burning out) once they all reached the same point in the sky.  A sixth and final object emerged, appearing to lag behind the initial objects but heading in the same direction and traveling at the same approximate speed.  It, too, disappeared once it reached the same point in the sky.  The entire event lasted between four and seven minutes.   The sighting was witnessed at an airport by personnel who have had numerous years in and around aircraft. This was not typical aircraft behavior.;32.4699;-90.1101999999997
