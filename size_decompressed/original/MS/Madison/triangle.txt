Silent, triangular-shaped object hovering in mid-air.;2014-08-01 22:20:00;2-3:00;Silent, triangular-shaped object hovering in mid-air Husband and I were driving east on Hoy Road, saw large triangular-shaped object to the north of us (we thought it was a plane coming in --too low for the distance, which is what led us to even notice it--to land at Madison local airport until we realized that it wasn't moving).  It looked to be about 100 feet off the ground.   It had 2 sets of 3 white lights on the points of the triangle.  It was not moving it seemed to be just hanging there in midair.  No sound.   We immediately turned north into the next street to follow it/get a closer look, but it had disappeared (which felt impossible, considering that it was there just a few seconds before).;32.4699;-90.1101999999997
