A Shooting star that Turned into a Moving Light;2010-11-07 18:30:00;5 min;A Shooting star that Turned into a Moving Light A friend and I was laying on a Sand Bar Fishing looking at the Stars as I usually do, Face Straight up to the sky and I see, what looked like a shooting star, and I turned to my Friend and said look at that,  He didn’t see it come into the Atmosphere but he seen it before I said look at that.  The object came into  the Atmosphere moving to the West with the speed of a Shooting Star but this object was much larger and as it entered it slowed somewhat,  It was bright with a orange tint at first. As I turned and said “look at that” the Object moved to the Southwest then Back to the West.  The Object moved with Great Precision.  It looked like a Laser Bouncing off Mirrors it was so precise.  The Object moved to the West and a Very Fast Speed, Much faster than a Plane, This I know because Memphis has a lot of Air Traffic, this Object was moving at double the Speed of any Plane, But as it headed to the west about 40 or 50 seconds, it moved again back to the North W! est what looked like into its Original Flight Path, The Object flew to the West getting smaller and smaller till it looked like it became stationary then it faded away. The reason I know this was something not normal is the way it moved to the left and right and the light was visible while moving away from us.   I’m not sure what it was, but we both saw it and confirmed how it moved and come into the Sky.;34.6879;-90.3672
