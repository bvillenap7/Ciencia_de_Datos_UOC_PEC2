I first thought it was a plane, it may have been a plane, but it looked more like a comet or meteor. Like the one that was caught on tape some years back over a football field.  Now I did not think it a craft, but It appeared to be going down in the harizion, in the western sky of mississippi. The tail seemed short for a plane, yet very wide since I could Not see the object. It was that far away. It may have been a comet, if it was not a plane. Oh it was going south to the north, downwards in the western sky of Mississippi.
