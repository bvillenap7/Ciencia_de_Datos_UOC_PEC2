Large ,bright white ,rectangular object hovers in western sky;2005-03-14 23:00:00;30 minutes;Large ,bright white ,rectangular object hovers in western sky The dogs were barking strangely so I went to the door to investigate. When I opened the door I heard a loud roaring, which caused me to look upward. There was a large object with white lights (non flashing) hovering low in the sky.It was very clear and you could see the image of the craft. The sound seemed to go away as I stepped into my front yard. You could clearly see that one part of the object was spinning. I ran inside to get the digital camera, binoculars and the movie camera. The digital camera picked up the object not to clear, but when you hit the quick fix button , the shape becomes very distinct. I'm 46 yrs old and my daughter is 11.;31.258;-89.8024
Large craft hovering, with bright clear lights;2005-03-14 23:00:00;30 minutes;Large craft hovering, with bright clear lights The dogs had been barking strangely for about 10 minutes when I went outside. There was a loud roaring sound, unlike an airplane or jet. This caused me to look upward when I saw a strange shaped craft with bright non flashing lights, white or clear in color.  The image was very clear, it appeared very large and was hovering low in the western sky. My 11 yr old  daughter and I were the only ones that saw it, she was frightened because it was so close and clearly recognizable. I ran in and got the digital camera, movie camera and binoculars,. Through the binoculars you could see a portion of the object spinning. The pics didn't come out too clear but you can tell there was something unusual there.;31.258;-89.8024
