2 large bright orange lights;2007-01-26 21:30:00;5 mins;2 large bright orange lights I was going home from work and it was a clear night.  It was then I noticed a single orange light that was twinkling like a star.  This light at first looked like maybe Mars in the low horizon, but it was to large for that.  I continued to drive looking at the light for about 3 mins.  I passed a group of trees which blocked my view for about 3 secs. and the single orange point of light was no longer at the horizon, instead it was nearly above me but this time it was 2 seperate bright orange lights.  It was moving very fast from due south to north.   I stop my truck and rolled the window down.  There was no sound coming from it. There were no other lights on it except for the 2 bright lights which continued past me until it went past a large group of trees.;31.2946;-90.4664
