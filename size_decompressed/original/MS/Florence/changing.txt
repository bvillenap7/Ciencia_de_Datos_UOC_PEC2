I told my wife to look at the object and she did. I put the baby down and went to get my binoculars which is a 7x35 extra wide Switf sportking.I looked at the object and it was disc or round i couldn't see because i wasn't holding the binoculars steady., so i braced them against a pole  and  i could see that the object looked like it was changeing shape to a triangle type then it went behind trees. The sky was very blue and clear.;32.1545;-90.1301
