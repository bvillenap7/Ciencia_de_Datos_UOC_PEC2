Dart-like craft emerged from tail of a fireball;2010-03-14 13:45:00;60 sec. or less;Dart-like craft emerged from tail of a fireball On 03/14/2010 at approx. 1:45 PM I was driving northbound on hwy 49 coming into Florence MS. Out of the northeastern sky a fireball appeared heading straight down for the ground. It burned with a bright green flame through a partly cloudy sky. Out of the trailing tracer behind the fireball a dart shaped craft appeared. It was silver or gray with no tail rudder and appeared to be standing still then suddenly began moving southeast perpendicular to the ground. It suddenly picked up speed and disappeared into the horizon leaving behind a light white beam-like tracer that quickly faded. Everyone on the road and in the vicinity saw the fireball/meteorite because traffic slowed down, several people swerved to avoid hitting each other. The meteorite made the local news but I have not seen any reports of the craft that emerged from it. I'm sure most were focused on the fireball because it was spectacular and the craft could have been mistaken for a low flying airplane. I have played the event back over and over in my head and the craft was definitely not an airplane, helicopter, or other known type of terrestrial aircraft. I am a chef/bartender that has lived in MS most of my life. I do not use drugs or alcohol.;32.1545;-90.1301
