Object changing shape in the sky.  ((anonymous report));2019-06-11 12:00:00;5 minutes;Object changing shape in the sky I was standing in my yard, and saw a grayish black, oval object in the sky.  I thought it was an airplane at first, but there was no sound, and it just completely stopped in mid-air for about a minute, and hovered.   It then turned in the opposite direction that it was flying (very quickly) and then turned again.  After a couple minutes of watching, it then started dropping straight down, changing form into a tiny circle as it dropped into the tree line.  Never saw it again.;33.3525;-89.194
