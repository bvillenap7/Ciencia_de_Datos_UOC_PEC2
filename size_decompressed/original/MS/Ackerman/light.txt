A bright light hovering in the southwestern sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius.  PD));2010-01-13 01:00:00;2 hours;A bright light hovering in the southwestern sky. I woke up around 1:00 A.M. last night.  For some reason I glanced out the window, and noticed a large bright star and it caught my attention.  It was blinking with different color lights through a pair of binocs you could hardly look at it, it was so bright.   Well i noticed it moved then stopped. It would hover then move again.  It didn't seem to have any set direction.  I woke my brother up and he was stunned at what we were watching.  While we were watching my dad heard the commotion, and being a skeptical man, he was dumbfounded at the object.  This object was in the southwest sky.  We couldn't hear any noise from it.  The object continued this for a couple hours until I went back to sleep.   If anyone could please tell me what this may of been I'd be obliged.  It was quite an alarming thing to watch it hover then move then hover again. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius.  PD));33.3525;-89.194
