At approx. 23:10 on September 11, 2011, I was standing outside staring at the stars with a green laser pointer.  As I was talking to a friend of mine, I turned facing Northwest and saw what I immediately accepted as a plane.  But all in a matter of seconds, I realized that the object had no blinking red or colored lights.  Just a white light about five times the size of a star.   But judging on the speed, it couldn't of been a plane, but about helicopter speed.  Yet, no blinking lights, and no sound.  My first instinct after about two seconds passing, was to just shine my laser pointer at it. As soon as the beam hit it, it disappeared.   From my experience, this very much resembled a meteor during a meteor shower.  But it only totaled a distance of about 6 from a viewing point, from the time of sighting to the time of disappearing.  Might of just been some space trash, but thought I'd report it anyways, just in case someone might of experience the same thing,! and have a better explanation.;34.6323;-89.8855
