Lights in the  Mississippi sky.;2010-04-28 23:25:00;7 min;Lights in the  Mississippi sky. A friend and I were returning home from an out of town baseball game. When we got close to home we left Interstate 55 at Como, MS exit. Traveled east on back road. Noticed a large dark triangle in the eastern sky. The moon was full and the sky wasn't black but the area in the triangle was black. As we watched one of the lights on the side of the triangle left the triangle and vanished. Following this the shape changed and appeared to move north. The movement was not rapid. We had stopped the car to watch what was going on. I was looking north and saw two balls of light one from the east and one from the west. The two objects passed each other and quickly vanished.The two appeared to moving at a rapid rate. We made a sharp turn over a bridge and we were slowly driving west.What appeared to be a glowing orb was seen in the nothern sky. It was very bright. As we watched it became larger and the light from it became very bright. It was as though it made several p! ulse like glows and then vanished. All of this occured over unplanted fields in a rural area. Today I rode over the area. I could find only one tower and it was marked with a red light. All of the lights we saw were bright white. We did see several planes.;34.6323;-89.8855
