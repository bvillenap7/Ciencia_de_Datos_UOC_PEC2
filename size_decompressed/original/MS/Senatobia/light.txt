I do not want to sound like one of those kooks that probably contact your agency all the time, but I have seen something that is a mystery to me. I am a retired Federal employee (34 years USACE) and I have always had a fascination with aviation, military aircraft, the space program and the heavenly bodies above.  I've always got a eye on the sky (day or night).  For health purpose, I walk at night in my small town neighborhood.   Tonight, 3 Aug 2014, at approx. 9:15pm Central time, I saw what I can only describe as a silent, stationary beacon in the night sky (like a lighthouse at sea) make a single revolution and disappear with no further sight or sound.  I pulled my cellphone and checked my “PlaneFinder” app, and as I expected, there was nothing there.  The truly amazing aspect of this event is that it occurred once before while I was walking at night, at roughly the same time in August of 2004.  Almost exactly ten years ago. I live in northwest Mississippi, 30 mile south of Memphis International.  We get a lot of FedEx traffic in the evenings so I’m quite familiar with their aircraft, their lighting and their sounds.  And helicopters are extremely audible.  Nothing that I know of in aviation, silently turns in place with an extremely bright search light that points downward. What do we have in our inventory that can cause such an occurrence?  Thanks,;34.6323;-89.8855
