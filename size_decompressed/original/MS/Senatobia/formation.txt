PD));2018-05-06 00:00:00;almost every night;My wife and kids have witnessed 3-4 objects hovering around our area close to HWY 4 West on our side of town.  I have seen these objects with them and by myself almost every night this week and almost nightly since around the 20th of April (or so).  These objects almost are somewhat triangular but almost remind me of something from Star Trek or Star Ward like a Warbird or Falcon type aerial vehicle.  HOWEVER, they seem to be hovering and only move so slightly and in a flight path unlike any regular plane I've ever heard of. Even as of last night, three to four of them are position in an almost quadrilateral type formation.  They seem to be just 'watching us'.  The objects we observe seem to give off a blue-ish hue...yet lights (flickering orange/green sometimes emanate from them).  They seem to almost react intelligently as I am wandering my yard trying to keep focused on them.  They flicker sometimes that it almost seems impossible to focus.  I have seen these thin! gs so often that any notion of considering it to be anything 'recognizable or explained away' diminishes.  My family and I also have witnessed red and green lighted low-flying aircraft in the skies on two of these occasions.  They don't seem to perceive the objects and 'they' in turn seem unaffected, as well.  It's freaky.  Has anyone else seen these? ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the possibility of stars and planets would have to be ruled out, before we conclude that the objects are genuine UFOs.  PD));34.6323;-89.8855
