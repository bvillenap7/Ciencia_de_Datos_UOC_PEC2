My dad and younger sister were on our way home from church Wednesday night when we saw a very bright light in the sky above hwy 49.   At first it seemed to be a radio tower but I reined it was a steady light, not blinking.  We got closer we realized the light was a giant spotlight shining into the sky.  At that same moment we all realized it was stationary!  This thing was hovering!  We pulled over and I jumped out to record it, but when I jumped out it flew off at an absurdly slow speed without making any noise!  I saw the bottom of the craft as it passed overhead, due to its lighrs on te bottom, and it was indeed in the shape of a triangle.  It then continued to fly away until it disappeared from view.;31.5285;-89.4816
