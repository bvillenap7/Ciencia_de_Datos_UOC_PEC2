I witnessed a stationary silver cigar craft about 2 miles in the distance. It appeared to be 500 feet above the ground.  Object was approx. 50-60 feet in width.  It stayed stationary for 1-2 minutes, then moved at an extremely slow speed moving from east to west.   I lost sight of it once it hit the clouds in the distance.   It was not a helicopter or a drone.  It made no noise and did not show any exhaust system.;34.2745;-88.3793
