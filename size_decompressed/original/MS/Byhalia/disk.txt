The Sun was bright when I looked into the sky and saw about 5 Jet Planes. I stopped looking. I started to explain to my Wife how Jet Planes operate. My Wife started looking into the sky, and that's when she spotted what appeared to like a huge, chrome, bowl shaped object almost in the middle of the Jet Planes. My wife told Me to look at it, and she asked me if I knew what it was. I could not explain what it was, but it was something that we had never seen before. It stayed in the same spot for about 10 seconds. It got smaller as it went up into the atmosphere, which took about 5 seconds.;34.8845;-89.6752999999999
