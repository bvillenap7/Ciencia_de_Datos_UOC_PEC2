They seem to spin or the lights (red green/blue white)moved around it,(was not blinking). Too high up in the sky to tell. traveled east then bout 4hrs. later, they were almost south. Could have been three. Third one was only visible for a short time cause it was so high. They could have formed a triangle pattern. they stayed same distance apart.;34.1242;-88.7329
