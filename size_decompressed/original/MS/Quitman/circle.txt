Circular craft outlined with white lights left perfect ring of fire behind;1989-05-19 20:00:00;1 hour;Circular craft outlined with white lights left perfect ring of fire behind The object appeared in a field across from our house.  The center of the craft was dark and blended in with the night.  The craft was outlined with white lights. There was no sound at all coming from the craft. This night was particularly dark and calm. Everyone in the house saw the craft and was too afraid to approach it, so we all watched from the window. A member of the family called the police dept.. During the wait for police, the craft remained still and lit (approx. 75 yards away from the house).  The fire dept. showed up as well as the police in around 20 minutes.  Both the fire and police dept. got out of their vehicles and approached the craft but they only got to the fence when the craft disappeared leaving a ring of fire in a perfect circle that remained in a circle and did not spread in or out of the lines.  The police and fire dept. gave us no explantion,left without questioning anyone and we heard no reports on the event. The next day the burnt circle in the field remained.  The farmer who owned the land questioned my family about the mysterious circle.  We gave him our explanation and he did not believe us. After it was all over the circle remained as a chilling reminder of that night and for everyone to see that passed by on the road. We have never reported this to anyone other than family or friends for fear of disbelief.  The house that we lived in at this time was a very old house, about 100 years old. Prior to this event, many other mysterious things happened here.  Family included me, 8 years old, My Mother, Father, Grandmother, and Uncle.  We were all witnesses.
