Bright, silent, star-like light moving across the sky, much faster than any jet airplane;2015-04-22 20:48:00;90 seconds;Bright, silent, star-like light moving across the sky, much faster than any jet airplane I stepped outside at 8:48 PM, Central Time Zone, to have a smoke.  It was a clear night and the stars were bright and beautiful.  While gazing up at the stars, I noticed a light moving across the sky at an amazing speed. It was a white light, as bright as the brightest star in the sky, and it was moving in a North/North-Easterly direction, in a straight line.  It appeared to be at a very high altitude, and it was moving at least 3 times faster than any jet airplane I have ever witnessed.  It took the light about one and a half minutes to move from the South horizon to the North Horizon. It was not a shooting star.  It made no sound. An hour later, at exactly 9:48 PM on the same evening, I witnessed the same kind of light moving along the same path and at the same speed.  I quickly pulled out my phone to try to get a video of the event.  However, as soon as I began recording, the light began to dim and disappear.  The entire recording only lasts 6 seconds, but the object can be seen moving away from a stars position before it disappears.;33.6068;-88.6478
