I also believe that some sort of procedure was performed on me.  It was 31 years ago. I was 13 years old at the time.  The only other person present in the home was my mother.  I do not remember the exact date or time, except that it happened in the middle of the night.  I was sleeping in my bedroom and was awakened by the presence of three beings standing around my bed.  There was one on either side of me and one at the end of my bed near my feet.  They were tall with unusually large heads.  I was unable to move or speak. I felt paralyzed and also terrified.  My knees were up and my legs were being held apart by the two beings who were on either side of me, while the third inserted an object inside me.  I never heard them say anything but it was as if the one at the end of my bed told me, we're almost done. The next thing I remember is waking up in my bed very early the next morning feeling horrified. I felt terribly violated and traumatized. I didn't know exactly what happened to me but I KNEW something had happened and that they had been in my bedroom. I remember looking around the room and nothing had been disturbed nor was anything out of place. I felt very strange for weeks after. Even years later something as normal and routine as going to the gynecologist was traumatic for me because it brought back the memory and the violation of it.  I have never told anyone about this experience, not even my mother. I knew something extraordinarily strange and perhaps unbelievable had happened to me. I have been afraid to speak of it my entire life.;33.6068;-88.6478
