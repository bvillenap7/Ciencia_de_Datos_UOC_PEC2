Neon wavy streak of light. 2 witnesses. In Mississippi.;2013-11-27 19:35:00;2-3 seconds;Neon wavy streak of light. 2 witnesses. In Mississippi. My 18 year old daughter and I were driving on HWY 8, headed east right at the Calhoun/Chickasaw County line.  We noticed a glowing (silver-ish) ball that was going back and forth from one ball to two balls.  Connected like Mickey Mouse ears.  It was just above the tree line.  Hovering.  After about 45 seconds, it disappeared.   Then about 20 seconds later a blinding neon light was coming straight at us.  At first, it looked like headlights.  But it was so bright that it lit up everything like looking through infrared glasses.  It was greenish blue waves that looked hot.  Like how the highway looks on a extremely hot day- kinda wavy.  This light shot straight through my car and passed by the passenger side window.   When I turned to look, everything in the background - the field - the trees were lit up.  And then it was gone.  It happened so fast that I didn't realize I had slammed on my brakes.  An 18 wheeler must have seen it too because he was stopped dead still on the highway too. The reason I'm posting this now is due to my daughter's nightmares.  About a month ago she started having dreams about the incident.  She won't go into detail about them but she has slept with me every night since.  I'm not sure why it started 5 months after we saw this, but she is terrified.  This isn't normal behavior for her.;33.9026;-88.967
