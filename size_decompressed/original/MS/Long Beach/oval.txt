Green oval turns colors, hovers, moves around fast, then disappears.;2017-04-18 22:50:00;2 minutes;Green oval turns colors, hovers, moves around fast, then disappears. We saw a green oval shape traveling town ward at an angle.  It was very bright and hovered.  Too bright.  It was listening to us and changed colors every time we spoke. It was too quiet.  It made no noise.  It seemed to follow us.  We went for our nightly run, and my wife said we were gone over an hour.  It moved too fast when I pulled out my phone.  It came down very close a few feet away.  Then moved slowly away.  It turned purple and disappeared in thin air.  It scared me and my son to death.  It went in and out of trees when we turned around.  The neighborhood was eerily silent.;30.3574;-89.1649

The light would get brighter and fade away at times, taking on a face look.   I was amazed.  It disappeared in about an hour.
