Motionless silver triangle high in the atmosphere.;2014-03-29 18:45:00;~10 seconds;Motionless silver triangle high in the atmosphere. Saw something strange the other day while standing in my driveway.  A friend of my son's had stopped by to see him, however he wasn't home and his friend and I began talking about U.F.O.'s/aliens.  She brought up the subject out of the blue which is even stranger since I had never met her before until that moment.   I looked up in the sky while we were talking and saw a silver triangle high up in the atmosphere.  I suppose you could say it was the size of a penny considering the distance.  I pointed up toward the sky and said: What's that?'  She looked up and said she didn't know__then this object 'faded' out.   Further away from where this object appeared, a jet was passing. I wonder if anyone on this jet saw what we did? Guess this is another mystery we'll never find the answer to.   The sky was cloudy that day so I don't know if it just 'disappeared'' or if the cloud cover was the reason it faded.  Nevertheless it wasn't another jet because it was motionless.;30.3574;-89.1649
