SO AS I  WALKED OUTSIDE I LOOKED UP, AS I ALWAYS DO IN HOPES OF SEEING A UFO. WELL, ON THAT NIGHT I GOT MY WISH. I SAW SOMETHING THAT MADE ME STOP DEAD IN MY TRACKS. THE OBJECT WAS ONLY ABOUT 30 FT. OVER ME. I NOTICED IT COMING IN FROM THE EAST FLOATING ALONG AT ABOUT 10 TO 15 MPH HEADED WEST. IT WAS WING SHAPED WITH A WING SPAN OF ABOUT 25 FT. AND ABOUT 10 FT. LONG FROM THE TIP TO THE TAIL. THERE WAS A FULL MOON OUT AND THERE WAS A STREET LIGHT ABOUT 20 FT. AWAY FROM WHERE I WAS STANDING. IT LIT UP THE UFO ENOUGH TO WHERE I COULD SEE THAT IT HAD A BROWN SHADE TO IT AND IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS COVERED IN SOME KIND OF FUR. IT HAD NO MARKINGS NO LIGHTS AND IT WASN'T MAKING A SOUND. I ALSO NOTICED THAT IT HAD  SOFT, ROUNDED EDGES TO IT, THERE WERE NO SHARP LINES NO SEAMS OR NOTHING ATTACHED TO IT. THE LEADING EDGE HAD A LONG CURVE TO IT WITH NOTHING ELSE ON THE TIP. THE FRONT END LOOKED TO BE ABOUT 6 FT. THICK AND TAPERED DOWN FROM TO THE TAIL. ALONG THE TAIL IT HAD THESE HALF CIRCLE LOOKING APENDAGE'S WHICH WERE ABOUT 2 FT. WIDE AND ABOUT 2 FT. LONG EACH. THEY WERE JOINED SIDE BY SIDE AND RAN ALONG THE ENTIRE END OF THE TAIL. IT FLEW RIGHT OVER MY HOUSE WITH NOTHING IN THE WAY OF MY VIEW. THE UFO DID NOT CHANGE ITS SPEED OR DIRECTION OR MAKE ANY OTHER MOVEMENTS. IT JUST FLOATED ALONG IN A STRAIGHT LINE. I WATCHED IT UNTIL IT WENT OUT OF SIGHT OVER SOME TREES. I WAS TEMPTED TO FOLLOW IT AND MAKE SOME KIND OF NOISE TO SEE IF IT WOULD SOMEHOW REACT BUT I WAS AFRAID TO BECAUSE I COULDN'T TELL IF THIS THING WAS SOME KIND OF CRAFT OR SOME KIND OF LIFEFORM. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I COULDN'T SLEEP FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. BELOW IS A ROUGH SKETCH OF THE BOTTOM OF WHAT I SAW THAT NIGHT. P.S. COULD YOU PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE HEARD OF ANY THING LIKE THIS BEFORE. THANK YOU, +++ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + {___/\___/\___/\___/\___/\___/\___/\___/\___/\__};30.3574;-89.1649
