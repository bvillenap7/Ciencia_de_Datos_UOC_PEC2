I was on my deck lifting weights and was between sets, so I was lying on my bench looking up at the sky.  I started tracking a jet which was moving rather slowly to the naked eye, as it was seemingly at a high altitude.  The jet was moving from Southeast towards Northwest.  Suddenly, a circular row of lights moved right over the jet and kept going the same direction the jet was going, only much much faster than the jet.  The circular row of lights appeared much higher than the jet and much larger also.  It travelled from horizon to horizon in what I have estimated to be about 5 seconds and was gone.  I found this rather odd I have seen satellites before on a few occasions and this didn't vaguely resemble any I have seen.  I don't know why I'm reporting this, just thought you might like to know.  This is the second oddity in our South Missippi skies that I have seen in less than 6 months, which is how long I have lived on the coast.  Any suggestions as to what it may have been?
