((anonymous report));2015-02-28 20:30:00;4 seconds;Oval/saucer like object that emited orange/reddish light.  Zoomed off in seconds, left trail of light it was so fast.  It knew we we saw I wish I knew about UFO report site earlier, but unfortunately that’s not the case and I wish I called within the week of this event taking place.   About 2 years ago, (maybe more, maybe less I am really sorry to say I don’t exactly know), I was driving my friend home and about half a mile down the road where his house is, we both saw an orange and reddish light hovering in the sky pretty far up it was about the size of this in the sky: (///////).  It was shaped like an oval, maybe saucer, and after about 4 seconds (maybe less) of looking at it, the UFO looking object zoomed off like we knew we were looking at it.  It didn’t disappear it ZOOMED and left a trail of light briefly.  It was stationary and then zip!  Left a brief light trail it was so fast! ((NUFORC Note:  Anonymous report.
