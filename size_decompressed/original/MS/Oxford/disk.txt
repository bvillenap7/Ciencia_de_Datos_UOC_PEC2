3 blue lit UFOs seen at dusk near local Walmart in Oxford, MS;2020-01-27 17:45:00;Unknown;3 blue lit UFOs seen at dusk near local Walmart in Oxford, MS I saw the 3 UFO’s on a photo from a pretty sunset outside the Oxford, MS walmart on Jackson Ave.  This is actually my 3rd sighting (my second sighting in Oxford MS—the first sighting in Oxford I had was back in fall of 2011 with my husband—we saw 3 similar saucer UFO’s together in formation and saw them rapidly dart away from each other), but this is the 1st time I took a picture and saw the UFOs *after* the picture was taken, and for that reason, I do not know how long the sighting last. Simply put, I was only taking a picture of the beautiful sky then later upon reviewing the picture saw the UFOs. The picture I have was taken in “live” mode on my iPhone, meaning the picture doubles as a mini video and can be broken down by multiple frames. There is no chance of window glare as I took the picture while walking to my car, thus I was not inside a car at the time. Reviewing the picture on live mode shows 3 UFOs slightly moving together in a tight formation, the! n the last few frames show them moving in rapid acceleration. The picture shows the Walmart store and the parking lot itself in the background, as well as a moon near the UFOs that help provide a sense of size and movement. I am happy to send the live picture to another iPhone for anyone else to see. **NOTE re my personal contact info- I concent to anyone contacting me, but please note I am changing cell phone carriers shortly, and have been told I will need to change my phone number thus, email is best point of contact**;34.3308999999999;-89.4837
