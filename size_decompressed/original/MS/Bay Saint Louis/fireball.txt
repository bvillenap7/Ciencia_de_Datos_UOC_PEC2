Orange pulsating orb over downtown.;2013-12-29 19:00:00;5-7 minutes;Orange pulsating orb over downtown While taking the trash out my husband spotted an orange round pulsating orb hovering above the homes on our block, he called me out to the street and we stared dumb founded as we watched the object move north east at a very slow steady pace.  The entire event lasted over five minutes, long enough that we attempted to run inside and grab our cameras.  Sadly our camera only had enough battery life to capture one photo, while everything else in the frame is still the object blurred and appears as a curved orange line, we assume this is due to how the object was pulsing, while watching with our naked eyes it appeared round and full of light.  After snapping the photo we stood in the street barefoot in our robes and watched until it disappeared. I should add, without giving too much personal information away, that my husband works at Stennis Space Center (30 minutes from our home) and has never encountered anything in his career to relate this object to.  The object was silent and much lower than any planes that fly in our area.;30.2984;-89.4625
