5 red circular objects merged into one large red circular object , emit a thin red burst upward, and drifted below the tree line.;2014-10-29 18:30:00;1 minutes;5 red circular objects merged into one large red circular object , emit a thin red burst upward, and drifted below the tree line. I saw 5 red circular objects in a circular pattern then they came together into one large red circular object.  The object drifted slowly down toward the horizon from about 40 degrees elevation. After 15 seconds a thin meteor like red light was emitted from the object and disappeared in a few seconds toward the sky.  The object continued to drift downward toward the horizon and slowly disappeared below the tree line. The entire episode was about a minute. I met a neighbor two days later that had seen this same large red circular object in the same southwest direction at the same time when she was walking around 6:30 pm and described the same size and motion that I saw.;30.2984;-89.4625
Large red lights merging into one and descending to the horizon and ejecting a meteor like tail toward the sky before complete descent.;2014-10-29 18:30:00;1 minutes;Large red lights merging into one and descending to the horizon and ejecting a meteor like tail toward the sky before complete descent. I looked toward the west /southwest from my carport.  I saw 5 red circular objects in a circular pattern about 40 degrees above the horizon.  After a few seconds they came together into 1 large circular object.  The large circle of red light continued to slowly descend toward the tree line.  After about 20 seconds a thin red flare shot from the center of the circle toward the sky.  The large object continued to slowly descend below the tree line.  It appeared to be at least one mile away, although difficult to say exactly.  From my perspective it was larger than the appearance of a full moon.;30.2984;-89.4625
