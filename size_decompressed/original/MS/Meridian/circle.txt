As I pulled in my driveway I seen different colored blinking lights and thought it was an airplane but realised the object was very close to my roof of my residents hovering. Immediately lights turned off and object moved fast as lightning diagonally back and forth a few times.  Released a very large blue flash that blinded me for a second as if a picture was being taken of me.   After the flash, I could not see where it flew away to.  Vanished in the night sky.;32.3944927272727;-88.6839227272728
Circular green object moving from north to south overhead.;2015-09-13 22:00:00;3-4 seconds;Circular green object moving from north to south overhead. On September 13th, 2015 at 10:00 pm, I entered my bedroom and sat on the bed and looked out my south facing window.  Immediately overhead a green, circular object moved from north to south and disappeared on the horizon.  The object made no sound.  It wasn't a flare, nor did it look like a shooting star.  The light didn't pulse nor did it flash.  The outer rim of the round object was a lighter green, with the inner part of circle being of a darker green.;32.3944927272727;-88.6839227272728
