Triangle over pond;2004-02-19 21:00:00;20 minutes;Triangle over pond Several nights before this event I had gone to let my dogs out in the backyard and behind our house is 100 acre tree reserve (we live in a very rural area) it was around 9-10pm and I saw a light shining through some trees which immediately blinked out and I thought how odd because the light was at tree top level. My  husband said maybe it is some deerhunters. A couple of night later I had walked down to my sons house across my pasture and when I was coming back the mist was rising in the pasture with a large area obstructing the stars.  Out of the mist above me I saw a horizontal beam of light like a laser shining out of it. It scared me and I ran on into the house. On the night of the 19th my son called me to come outside. I can see his home from my front yard and he was standing on the deck. He said look down at the pond. The pond is downhill from my house in the middle of my pasture with the tree reserve on the backside of it. A very bright light was shining down into the pond so bright that I couldn't see the source. My son said,  I have been watching it for 20 minutes. In just a few minutes the light went out and triangle shaped caraft was lifting up!!! It turned toward my house and lifted its nose and slowly acclerated upward.  It was making a pumping sound like an old washing machine for a few seconds then became absolutely quiet. It had the white corner lights and orangish light in the center. After reaching an altitude of a couple hundred feet all the lights went out and small red blinking light came on. As it flew off it you could no longer tell what it was. With the linking red light it now looked like any plane that would be crossing the night sky. I don't know if the other 2 events have anything to do with this but it all happpened in the same week.;32.3944927272727;-88.6839227272728
