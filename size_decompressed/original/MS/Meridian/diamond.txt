What I saw zipped across the sky so fast it was diamond in shape.;2017-03-06 21:48:00;10 seconds;I was passing by Marion Rd in Meridian, Mississippi.  As I cross over the intersection, I cross over the first tracks.  Something told me to look up, and I did and what I saw zipped across the sky so fast, it was diamond in shape.  The speed was unbelievable, I watched it until it went out of sight.   I am baffled and excited at the same time.  I never thought I would see any thing like this in my lifetime.;32.3944927272727;-88.6839227272728
