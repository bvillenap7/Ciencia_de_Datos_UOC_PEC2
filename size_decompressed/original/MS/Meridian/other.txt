Other family members were also at the bedside.  I turned to the window sobbing and was looking to the southwest.  There were large cummulus white clouds in the sky.   While I was looking out the window to the sky I saw a pewter gray round object flying through the air.  I almost turned to say , Look, look! but the object entered a cloud and I decided not to.  Then I saw it exit the cloud and and cross the sky and enter another cloud and I no longer saw it.  It came from my left and was about the size of a half dollar and got smaller as it climbed into the clouds.  It was completely smooth, round like a ball bearing and had no markings.

I saw three bright lights, came back later, and they were gone.;2005-08-30 20:30:00;1 hour;I saw three bright lights, came back later, and they were gone. Me and my parents were sitting outside on our porch when my dad noticed three lights we've never seen before.  They were brighter than the north star.  This was at night.  We saw these around 8:30PM.  We came out at 9:00PM and the lights were gone.  We looked all around the sky, but we could never find them.  They were arranged in a line, evenly spaced.  It was not Orion's belt, I looked for it to check.  My mom, dad, and I saw them.   It was the night after Hurricane Katrina hit us, so the power was out all around.

Two of us saw a flying triangular gray illuminated object above our house and yard.;2008-09-29 19:20:00;12 - 25 seconds;Two of us saw a flying triangular gray illuminated object above our house and yard. My 11 year old daughter and I were jumping on the trampoline. We stopped to lay down and look at the stars. Upon looking up a triangular shape caught my eye. It had just become dark and for a split second I thought it was a weird bird. Then I looked at how it flew, from east to west, then back again, then in a circle. I asked my daughter if she saw it and she said, Yes I do. What is it? Is it a ghost or a demon or a spaceship? It moved very gracefully, then turned south and began to fly over us. It never increased or decreased in speed. It appeared as a triangle with a hollow center, sort of like a boomerang with stripes. There were no lights but some sort of very small illumination like a glow which gave it the ghostly appearance. It was gray, a light gray and made no sound at all. The thing continued to fly, very smoothly and gracefully, to the south until we could no longer see it. About a minute later what looked like a star, just a simple star, began to zigzag across the sky. It disappeared twice and then flew to the southeast. We went inside and told my boyfriend, who laughed at us. Then one of my other children suggested we draw what we saw (the triangular thing) in opposite rooms. We did and the pictures are identical. This concerns me as I've had weird things happen to me all my life - playing with strange objects in my room as a small child (that no one else ever knew about as they visited me at 3 a.m. or so), a triangle cut into my back in the middle of the night (as with a laser) that I never felt happen, a metal rod instered into my heel that I never remember the trauma of receiving (showed up on an x ray).;32.3944927272727;-88.6839227272728
