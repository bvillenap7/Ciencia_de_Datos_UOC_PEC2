Strange object sitting in sky.  ((anonymous report));2019-01-09 01:40:00;20 minutes;Strange object sitting in sky Saw a silver oval sitting still in the sky above the trees.  Not moving not falling just still. Thought it may have been a reflection at first, couldn’t make sense of it.  Wasn’t falling wasn’t moving just sitting perfectly still in the sky.  Dull silver, no sound just sitting.  Was driving back with my family in the van.  All of us saw it headed north bound.  Stopped to try to get a photo but it was gone.
