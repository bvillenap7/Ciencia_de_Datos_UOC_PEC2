Series of unexplained lights over Mississippi Sound.;2015-06-16 20:30:00;20 seconds;series of unexplained lights over Mississippi Sound At approx 20:30-20:45, myself and a co-worker seen a series of lights that seemed at first like a set of flares that a fighter jet would release if he had a missile locked onto him, but instead of it only going in one direction of travel, it had a mirror effect with it.  The lights started in the middle and went outwards in sequence.  Example:  Imagine having around 20-30 lights, half on each side of a center, one light on each side came on at the same time as the next light on each side came on the previous light went out one it went through all if the lights in the series.   It happened again SAME location not higher, not lower, not left or right.  I tried thinking of things that might resemble or even make this light show, but can't seem to figure it out.   This is the THIRD TIME we have seen this light show in a year, and it's ALWAYS in the same location out one the Mississippi Sound.;30.3637384615384;-88.5567153846154
