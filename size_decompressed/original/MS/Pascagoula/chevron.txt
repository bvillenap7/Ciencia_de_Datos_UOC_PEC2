Hovering UFO in the shape of stealth plane outlined by moonlight on the Mississippi Coast.;2004-04-01 21:00:00;20 seconds;Hovering UFO in the shape of stealth plane outlined by moonlight on the Mississippi Coast. In Pascagoula, Mississippi a UFO was spotted by myself and a passenger that rode along with me in my vehicle. It was a dark and somewhat cloudy night. At a red light at the intersection of US Highway 90 and Market Street we saw a massive object outline above us. Stopped at the red light I got out of the vehicle to look up at what seemed to be a hovering object in almost the exact shape of a Stealth Bomber. All that was clearly visible was an outline (by moon light)of the back in and most of the sides, but not so much the nose. It was not moving and seemed to be very large but very high in the air. I’ve never seen reports of such UFOs and lack the knowledge of the capabilities of Stealth Bombers but I believe this was different. I’ll never forget it.
