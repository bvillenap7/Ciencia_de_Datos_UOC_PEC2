Ball of light moving at a rapid speed.;2004-08-07 20:00:00;30 seconds;Ball of light moving at a rapid speed. The ufo I saw was a white ball.  It was at a fairly high altitude and moving at a speed that would not have been a jet or plane. I was sitting on the backyard swing about 8 p.m. central/standard time Saturday, Aug. 7th, and looked down on the ground for only a couple of seconds to pick up some trash underneath the swing and when I looked back up at the sky in the clearing was this ball of light that had just appeared out of nowhere in a vast clearing in the sky.  It was moving quite swiftly.  I live not far from the airport here and I can say with certainty that there were no strobe lights as required by the AFA as well as this being a perfectly shaped ball.  When a plane is at that altitude it simply cannot appear to move as fast as this ball of light was doing.  It was making a straight shot through the sky, had no sound, and left no chemtrails of any kind, nor was it losing any altitude like a meteor particle or falling star would.   It moved across a vast opening in the sky in 30 seconds or less and had this been a plane I would have sat and watched it for several minutes before it made that distance.   This is the second sighting I've had the other one was saucer shaped over downtown Jackson, MS, in May.;32.4153833333333;-90.1192916666667

We went outside, we live in an apartment complex, and looked up at the sky facing NE, and we saw some white circular shapes.  First thing we told my niece is that they are birds.  But we kept looking, and we saw that light was reflecting off of the shapes. If you've ever seen birds, you can tell what their color is, and light does not reflect off of them. We kept looking for a good minute, and there were literally more than one hundred.  They were making fast movements, and out of nowhere, they would start disappearing in groups.  And then, they were gone.  It lasted about a minute and a half. Today (02/15/2013 around 16:00) we saw them again. It lasted about the same short period, and there were hundreds of them.  And like the day before, they disappeared in groups.  If they are birds, I have never seen birds do that.  We birds fly away, as far as I've seen, you can see them leave because they usually don’t go higher.  And light does not reflect off their bodies!  We are going to try to record them on camera tomorrow.;32.4153833333333;-90.1192916666667
