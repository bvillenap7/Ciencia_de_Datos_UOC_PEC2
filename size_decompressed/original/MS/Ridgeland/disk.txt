Low , non moving, white , oval/sperical(blimp like) object seen in Ridgeland at 11 AM.;2004-10-04 11:00:00;not sure;Low , non moving, white , oval/sperical(blimp like) object seen in Ridgeland at 11 AM. I was driving to class a little before 11: A.M. About 5 minutes before I reached the Ridgeland exit I looked over and saw what appeared to be a white plane, but I did not see wings. I am slightly near-sighted so I passed it off as vision problems, but then when I got a full view of the object I discovered it was not moving. It was hovering there, not going forward, and it was too low to the ground to be a plane. There was a building several yards away and it was higher than the building, but it was still very low. After studying the object for a minute it slowly rose a few feet into the air but continued to hover. It was then that I took the Ridgeland Exit and went to my class. I don't know what it was. It was not a plane or a blimp although it resembled more of a blimp like object. It was not particularly big or small, it was probably a little bit smaller than a commercial plane, but bigger than a small plane. It was white. It had no lights and no markings. At the time there were many cars on the interstate so I'm sure others must have seen it, especially since the object was not very far away and it was a clear, sunny day outside.;32.4153833333333;-90.1192916666667
