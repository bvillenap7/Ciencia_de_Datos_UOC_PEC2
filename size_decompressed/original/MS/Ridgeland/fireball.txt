About 30 amber to orange lights moving north on the west side of I-55.;2015-05-23 05:45:00;5 minutes;About 30 amber to orange lights moving north on the west side of I-55. While driving to work on I-55 southbound, the same route I take to work every day, I noticed a few dozen amber to orange lights as I looked toward the Washington Monument replica that is located at about the Ridgeland Madison border.   I pulled over to the side of the interstate and noted that they were moving in a northbound direction, all at the same speed, in a lose formation.   I turned off the radio and rolled down the window but heard no sound.  I have never seen anything like this.;32.4153833333333;-90.1192916666667
