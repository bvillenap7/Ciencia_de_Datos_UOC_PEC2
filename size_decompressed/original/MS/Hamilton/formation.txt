I was looking up into the dark morning sky about 6:00am and l noticed 3 bright lights that were in a straight line pattern in the sky. What I thought at first was a airplane of some sort but the lights didn't flash like an airplane lights, just 3 white lights moving.  I then got the attention of a co worker and he started watching  By this time the object started to change direction moving more towards higher altitude faster then When I first seen it.  In a matter of seconds the white lights had turned in direction and seemed to be fading out of site.  This is when i realized that this was not an airplane nor helicopter because i could see the stars in the sky and these lights were fading fast like leaving the atmosphere.  Then it was gone.  As i drove home i continued to watch the sky for it again, but no such luck but i did see a few airplanes and their blinking lights.;33.7423;-88.4136
