Brown sphere or disc with 7 evenly-spaced yellow of gold spots. It was a perfectly clear day, sometime around noon.  I was outside working in my front yard when I stood up and movement caught my eye.  My first thought was that I was seeing a hawk diving towards its prey, but as I focused on the object, I knew it was nothing of the sort.  I can't be absolutely sure if it was a disc or sphere, but if I had to guess I would go with sphere. It was traveling from the NW to the SE, a few degrees North from directly overhead as it passed over.  It was brown, the color of an old penny, with seven evenly-spaced yellow or gold spots.  I have described it to others as kind of looking like a soccer ball.  Hold a pencil at arm's length looking at the end and that's approximately how big it appeared, maybe 1/4 the size of a full moon.  There was no smoke or vapor trail and no sound or sonic boom.  When I first caught sight of it, it was about half way between the horizon and overhead and I watched it until it faded into the distance like a high-altitude jet.  It traversed over 90 degrees of the sky in just a few seconds, almost as fast as a meteorite. After it was gone I stood there in my yard for a couple of minutes trying to make sense of what I had just seen, then called my sister to tell her about it.  I was still just a tad excited.  I reported it to MUFON within a few days and looked to see if there were any other sightings for similar objects on the same day, but came up empty.;32.0997;-89.2199
