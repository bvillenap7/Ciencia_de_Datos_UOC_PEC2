Bright, round orange-red object flying across sky New Years Eve 2012 7:00 pm.;2012-12-31 19:00:00;10 minutes;Brigh,t round orange-red object flying across sky New Years Eve 2012 7:00pm My husband and I went to a local convenient store on New years Eve 2012 approximately 7:00 pm.  He went inside and I was just sitting in the vehicle when I noticed a big, bright orange-red round shape moving steadily across the night sky.   The light on this object was a continuous orange-red color, it never blinked, changed color, shape, or move any direction but straight. I watch the sky pretty often and I have watched planes at night with their blinking lights, but this was different.   After watching the object for about five minutes my husband got back in the vehicle and I pointed it out to him so we drove down the road to follow it.   As we were driving down the road the object seemed to stop moving for a brief period of time.   For about 20 seconds it was out of our sight then as we regained sight of the sky again the object was just gone from the sky, it was nowhere to be seen again.;31.1116571428571;-90.5125571428572
