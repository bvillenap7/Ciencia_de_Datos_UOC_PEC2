Late one afternoon my son & I were traveling home on a usually busy interstate but this day or moment we were the only ones there as this craft came over some trees about couple hundred feet maybe ahead of us it then came to a total stop n dead air, I slowed down and  we passed under this object it had no sound what so ever. The object was greyish pewter color & had very small twinkling lights all around it.  As we passed under & away from this object I slowed down & pulled over ( My son screaming & hollering that they want to take us) He's always claimed this. He was about 10 at the time & refuses to discuss this even now, But as we were looking back maybe few seconds passed & it just left in a flash & I do mean FLASH that all we saw was a blurr.
