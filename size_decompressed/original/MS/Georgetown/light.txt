With binoculars, we can see strobes of green red and bright white lights. We ruled out aircraft after realizing an aircraft would not be moving like that. East of this one, we saw another one moving around like the other one. This is the second time in a month, we have seen this over our home, but in different areas of the sky. What is it?
