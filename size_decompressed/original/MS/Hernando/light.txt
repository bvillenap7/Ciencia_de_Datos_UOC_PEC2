Fog like but solid, almost transparent.  First two objects were as ovals, rapid moving like a flash light beam in the air, moving extremely fast.  Tonight's object was moving from N to S same flight path (but opposite direction), but larger chevron image..no sounds at either sightings, clear night with stars....it wasn't moving as fast as the oval flash light beams, but appeared to float so smoothly at great speed.  No air craft in the air, no beacon lights fairly dark star lite night...resembled ghost as see in TV programs almost transparent, but yet you could tell they were solid objects...moving very fast..a blink of an eye, you would miss them....;34.8068;-90.0096000000001
