The objects werent exactly shaped like a teardrop but that is the closest description you have.  It was shaped like 2 tear drops with the tips touching.  I only saw 2 but there could have been more im not sure.  The objects changed from a blueish to a redish then a purpleish color with a haze around them.  Im the only person that saw them that i know of.  Ive never done drugs or drank.  I smoke cigarettes, and i had only been up for about an hour when i saw this.
