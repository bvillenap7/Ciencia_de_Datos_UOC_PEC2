Craft sighted moving at high speeds above the tree line;2013-07-23 17:10:00;2 seconds;Craft sighted moving at high speeds above the tree line I was approximately 10 miles south of Laurel Mississippi heading southbound towards Hattiesburg, to go home from work at 6:10 pm.  To the East I noticed about 20-50 feet above a tree line, perhaps 2-5 miles away there was a white disc travelling at a high speed across the treeline (tall elder pines about 90-140 feet high approximately).  It took approximately 1.5 seconds for the disc to travel across the span of my driver side window where I ceased to be able to follow it. The most frightening aspect is about 20 seconds before the sighting I started to get images and thoughts of extra terrestrials in my head and cycling through thoughts about 'what is out there' as I often research at home.  I turned my music down to clear my head and something inspired me to look East.  When I did it was within 2 seconds that the craft appeared.  I often research extra terrestrial beings and craft in my free time as well as falsified research on moon landings and NASA space programs but have never witnessed anything myself.   I have never had any ESP or signs of the like but this particular moment has definitely left me puzzled.  It is almost as if I knew the craft was there before I looked.;31.713456060606;-89.0937515151516
