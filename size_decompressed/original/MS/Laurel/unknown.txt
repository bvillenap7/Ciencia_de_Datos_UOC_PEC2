A red glowing object moving in and out of clouds that had a red yellow and green color when not in the direct path of the sun;2012-08-30 17:00:00;10 minutes;A red glowing object moving in and out of clouds that had a red yellow and green color when not in the direct path of the sun I saw a red glowing object in the  western  sky at about 17:00 hours on 8/30/2012 It appered to reflect sunlight from it.  It moved slowly across the sky  starting and stopping ,   moving in and out of the clouds&gt I had to move from one side of my house to the other to get pictures of it.  I could not tell the shape of it because of the red reflection from it.  I wondered  how it was reflecting  with the sun in front of my and not coming from my back .   At one point it moved very fast to the left and  was out of the sunlight above a tree.  I didnt see the red glow this time. Then it moved back into the sunlight path and had a large red haze around it . It moved into the clouds , then out the other side of them  still a red glow around  it.  The last picture i took   it went slowly up out of a cloud and then straight up and dissapeared i have no idea what is was but i have never seen anything like it.
