Glowing red sphere slowly descending in the sky.;2014-12-19 15:00:00;2 minutes;Glowing red sphere slowly descending in the sky As I was driving south on 16th Ave., I spotted a slowly falling red glowing sphere to my left. A trail of smoke was following the sphere.   I watched as the sphere descended and then landed somewhere in a ditch on the side of the road.  When it made contact with the land in the ditch, lots of smoke was all around it.   Whatever it was, it was small enough that I could not see it once it went into the ditch.   I did not drive back to inspect it further.;31.713456060606;-89.0937515151516
