bright object moving slowly across sky .Too bright to be airplane and no red or green wing lights;1999-10-26 23:13:00;3min.;bright object moving slowly across sky .Too bright to be airplane and no red or green wing lights I was going west on hwy84 south of Lauel,Ms. I saw a very bright light to my left at 23:13on 10-26-99.It looked like it was not movingwhen i frist saw it. then i notice that it was moving .thought that it was not a airplane because it was too big .I stopped and got out to get a better view. I held my left thumb up to see if it covered the object. It was bigger than it so i extended my arm and held up two fingers, then three and it was bigger than them.So i watched it a couple seconds.It was moving at a steady but slow speed towards Laurel, coming out of the south, I could not see if it had solid form because it was too far from me .Ichecked my speedometer  so i could see how far i was from Laurel.,Ms. when i got there it showed i was 5miles when i stopped. the sky was clear and alot of stars could be seen.It was oval shaped and no sound.;31.713456060606;-89.0937515151516
