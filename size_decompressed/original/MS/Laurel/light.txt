Lights captured on wild game camera.;2008-10-19 23:09:00;5 days;Lights captured on wild game camera. These pictures were taken with a digital wild game motion camera. This object was captured four seperate times. Two on 10/19/08 at 11:09pm and at 11:12pm. The other two pictures were captured on 10/26/08 in a different part of the woods. In these pictures it looks like a beam of light but if you look closely it is the object in motion and there was no wild game in these pictures so these objects in motion triggered the camera to take the picures. ((NUFORC Note:  Critter cam photos show deer in frame.  Possible reflection from a nearby insect, or some other small object.  Probably not a genuine UFO.  PD));31.713456060606;-89.0937515151516
