Plane and fireball signaling each other?;2006-02-20 20:00:00;1 minute;Plane and fireball signaling each other? First let me say I live way out in the country on a dirt road with only a few scattered residences. Anyway, I was out feeding my dog in the backyard and when I finished I looked up to observe the stars which were beautiful and clear.  I noticed across the road to the west on the horizon and through the trees a very bright, white light was shining through. There is nothing there for miles as it is a huge tree farm and very rural. I thought  I bet somebody is night hunting. I also heard, and saw, a plane  going overhead coming from the east. I could clearly hear it. It was about 20000 feet up. Oddly, it had landing lights on. It blinked its lights 3 times! Just a few seconds later a huge fireball with a long burning tail came from the northwest. I thought its going to crash to the earth! But it burned out just seconds before impact. Strangely the light on the horizon blinked out and the plane shut all its lights off and I could hear it heading off to the west. All this occured in seconds of each other and may have a mundane explanation, although it appeared to be comminication of some sort to me.
