THIS IS NOT JUPITER.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius??  PD));2012-11-24 00:00:00;1 hour;THIS IS NOT JUPITER I was showing my grandkids orion and jupiter, when I noticed a star further to the east of Jupiter and more behind my house.   We went out back to gaze at it and as I zoomed in on it, it turned out to be a cross with one big light in the middle, four lights horizonal, two on each side of big light and four lights vertical, to at the top and two at the bottom.   There were also lights on the inside angles of the cross that extended out to the edges.  The lights were stationary, fixed, and they pulsated  IT WAS CLEARLY NOT JUPITER although I saw it at the same time too.  Also checked stellarium.  I called the hotline as I was recording the sighting. I don't know what it was, but it went from 10,000 to 30,000 ft. as I watched and recorded it for an hour. Have vid!  Not there tonight 11/25/12, 8:47PM  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Sirius??  PD));32.3404;-90.3273
