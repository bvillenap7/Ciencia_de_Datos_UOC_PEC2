UFOs are real but MUFON is not;2012-01-06 20:15:00;3 mins.;UFOs are real but MUFON is not My first sighting was on Oct. 16, 2011, as well as Nov. 2 of a  white flashing light high in the sky that stops flashing white and starts flashing red, blue, and green.   As I was taping it tonight my granddaughter alerted me to a small star very high in the sky that was moving in a figure eight pattern.  It was obvious that it was not a star by the wide pattern of movement.   I know this will go no where with MUFON or NUFORC, but I want others to know that they are alone in seeing the unknown lights in the sky.  I have videos but I won't bother uploading because no one will contact me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  We have no way to contact the source of the report.  PD));32.3404;-90.3273
