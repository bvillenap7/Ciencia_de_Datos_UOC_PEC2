It was going southwest and very high in the sky.  I went to get my camera that I keep pluged up I unpluged it, turned it on and returned outside.  As I pointed at the light my camera beeped and went dead.   We continued to watch the light as it changed onto an circle of lights blinking red,blue, and white. Then it just disappeared.   This is the second time I've seen this circle of colored lights, an third time seeing the blinking light that starts before the color lights. Sending video from Oct. 16, 2011  Filed report on Oct. 23, 2011 morphing white blinking light that turn into circle of colored lights;32.3404;-90.3273
