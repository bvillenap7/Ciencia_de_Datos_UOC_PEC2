Single pulsating white light with occasional green flash at bottom hovering below the clouds to the west;2015-03-31 23:00:00;>15 minutes;Single pulsating white  light with occasional green flash at bottom hovering below the clouds to the west On 3/31/2015 at 11:00PM,  I went outside of my Horn Lake, Ms. home to watch a thunderstorm passing through Memphis, TN,  which is approximately 15 miles north of my location.  Cloud cover was 100% with no breaks in the clouds.  It was not raining at the time at my location.  There were no stars or planets visible, nor was the moon.  To the north west, I saw several airplanes break through the clouds and prepare to land at Memphis International Airport. As I stood on my front porch, I noticed a strange light due west of me about 45Â° above the horizon below the thick clouds that seemed very out of place.  It was white in color and would dim slightly and then brighten in a pulsating rhythm with an occasional green flash at the bottom of the light.  It hovered in the same spot, not moving at all.  I called my boyfriend outside to see it and he watched it for a few minutes, but had no idea what it could be.  I could not get a photo or video with my camera due to the size, distance, and lighting.  I remained on the porch and watched it for about 10-15 minutes more before going inside. When I went inside, I posted on facebook about what I saw.  A friend of mine, also in Horn Lake, MS, commented that she had witnessed the same thing.  She also could not identify what the object was. I am a 47 year old mother of 3 grown sons and do not currently work outside the home and my boyfriend is a 53 year old transmission builder.  The friend that also witnessed it from a different location is approximately 30 years old and a clerical worker.;34.9469;-90.0485000000001
