Approximately 2030 on 5 Nov 2003, I observed a fireball type object in the northern sky. Short duration. The head was a brilliant white, and the rather short tail that was predominately blue. No sound was heard. The sky was partly cloudy that night. The direction of flight was from NNW to NNE, crossing the N/S meridian. The two things different were a. how brilliant the head was, abd b. the impression that I had of a slightly (very slightly) curved course. As I said, no sound and it was a cohesive mass, not breaking apart or shedding part of itself as it went down toward earth.;34.9469;-90.0485000000001
