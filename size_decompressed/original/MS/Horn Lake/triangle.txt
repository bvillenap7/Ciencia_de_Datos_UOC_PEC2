Triangle shaped ship with white lights , moving silently threw the sky  500 Lights On Object0: Yes;2005-02-01 22:00:00;15 min;Triangle shaped ship with white lights , moving silently threw the sky  It was a Huge Triangle shape ship with four to six white lights on the bottom of the V shape. About 3 football fields big.  Everything was dead silent, and a feeling of fear grips us.  We couldn't believe what we were seeing.  We were on a wooded highway with very little traffic at this time of night.  The object was moving silently just above the tree tops.  We were so scared.  I began to drive very fast away from the object.  We became very sleepy shortly after this event and pulled over in a church parking lot to rest. When we awoke 3hours had passed.  The rest of our drive was spent pretty much in silence, until we arrived home. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));34.9469;-90.0485000000001
