2 cylinder or tube objects above the city of Memphis.;2005-05-05 09:00:00;10 sec;2 cylinder or tube objects above the city of Memphis. Horn Lake Park in Horn Lake, Mississippi, very near Memphis, TN airport. Early morning I was working out. Laying on the deck doing situps...skys were clear, sunny. FedEx planes and other aircraft were out. Very busty morning. However, out of the blue...an object that looked like a cylinder or a tube...very metallic flew by...no sound. It was low...maybe 1000ft? First thing I thought was...wow where is the wings? I dismissed it until another tube went by....exact flight path as the other. Same description. It didn't hit me until after I seen them that I started wondering. Where were the wings? Where was the sound? Was it a missile? Seemed odd it was flying in such busy skys...but then again...it made perfect sense because the skys were so busy anyway with planes and such. Besides that who would report it? Its taken me 3 months just to report it because I had to come to termsn with what I seen. A metallic tube or cylinder object flying about 1000 ft maybe a bit more up in the air. How long or big? Dont know...didn't see it long enough. Very strange. I decline to give my personal information. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));34.9469;-90.0485000000001
