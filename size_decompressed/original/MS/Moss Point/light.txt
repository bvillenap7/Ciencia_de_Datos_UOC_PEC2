Floating lights in the early night sky. 12 lights approx. 200 feet from the ground.;2016-11-11 17:30:00;5-10 minutes;Floating lights in the early night sky. 12 lights approx. 200 feet from the ground. We all saw what appeared to be floating lights. They weren't white, more of a yellowish tone.  They appeared to be moving from the north towards the south and maybe at times, southeast.  Possibly 200ft from the ground.  They were low.  At first we thought they were lanterns, then we thought helicopters, neither.  They sort of fell to the ground and Or out of sight.  Really weird and not something expected.  The were in a regular flight pattern, as we don't live too far from a small airport.  These were not planes.  No noise.  Maybe drones, but 12 at a timeâ€¦  Anyway, was hoping someone else noticed this occurance?  We will be looking this evening, just in case.;30.4782774193548;-88.5094258064516
