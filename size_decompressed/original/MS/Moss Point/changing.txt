UFO Sighting Moss Point, MS.;2018-09-12 08:00:00;20:00;UFO Sighting Moss Point, MS. Wednesday, Sept 10, 2018 8pm.  Heading home from having dinner at San Miguelâ€™s going over Moss Point bridge heading back to Pascagoula.  As we were passing the big bridge, my husband and 2 kids notice something up in the sky shining with lights.  Clear white and flashing lights.  It was 8 object, best way to describe tubes (straws) completely lit up but also each had maybe 4 flashing lights.  They were all touching seem to be one object but then a few seconds split away from each other turn into circular shapes, then completely lit like a red/orange color.  Splitting away from each other changing into a circular shape, then floating close to each other.  Flying away and also turning all visual lights off.   I have never seen anything like it in my life and it really made my blood drop.  I am not a believer and never put thought into it but what I saw was something out of this world and made me scare.  Sharing my story. In Moss Point,MS heading to Pascagoula.;30.4782774193548;-88.5094258064516
