He slowed down to take this picture.  The blue lights on the bottom left are from a strip mall and a new led advertisement sign  on the side of the road.  You can see the taillights of a car ahead of him and the head lights of a car in the distance. This is not on a flight path.  This object was silent and low to the ground.;32.3299;-90.0915
