Saw odd shaped object in sky in daylight.;2009-09-23 18:00:00;10 min;Saw odd shaped object in sky in daylight. While arriving to work, I noticed somthing strange in the sky.  It was dark in color.  I could see it plainly against a cloud in the background.  It was a tall looking object with something sticking out of the side of it.  It did not look very aerodynamic.  I went into the locker room and changed clothes.  When I exited the locker room I noticed it was much closer than before.  I walked about 100 yards to the shop I work in.  By this time it was flying over the shop.  I grabbed one of my co-workers and showed it to him.  At the same time another co-worker rode up in his work truck and asked me What was that?  By this time it was almost out of sight.  There is an air force base in the direction it was headed.  It was very strange to all of us.  We thought it might have been something from the base, but at the same time it was so strange it makes me think otherwise.;32.3299;-90.0915
