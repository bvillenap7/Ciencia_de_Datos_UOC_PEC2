Flashlight looking lights looking for something in feild in Dulce, New Mexico.;2009-06-02 00:40:00;4-5 minutes;Flashlight looking lights looking for something in feild in Dulce, New Mexico. I was looking out the window one night on June 2, 2009 and noticed some lights in the field across the street from my house. At first it look like people were walking in the field with flashlights, but it was around 12:40 a.m.  and I looked again and it was clear the lights were floating in the air as if they were looking for something on the ground. The lights were turning on and floating and then they would turn off and come back on. My brother was also with me and went to get binoculars. I quickly got my blackberry out and filmed the incident. The lights moved around in circular motion and looked to be about 3-4 ft above the ground. They moved around fast and were flashing by a road. The main highway is nearby and a car came over the hill and the lights turned off immediately. As soon as the car was out of sight the lights turned on and started flashing again. There were 3 different lights and the colors seemed to change. My brother returned with the binoculars and said it look like a orb, a round like shape with lights around it. We continued to watch the lights and it was obvious it was a UFO.  The lights begin to spread apart and went there own ways and I observed one light that was green spinned around very fast then flew off. The lights then went out and I began to feel shaken so we went inside. I couldnâ€™t believe that I got it on video so we went inside and uploaded to the computer. You can see the lights but the quality of the video is not so great.  I believe what I seen was a UFO. I seen one close up about two weeks before this incident so I know they are out there!;36.8598;-107.0602
