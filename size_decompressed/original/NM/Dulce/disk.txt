Small u.f.o. hovering over Archuleta Mesa in Dulce, NM.;2004-12-13 12:29:00;Photo;Small u.f.o. hovering over Archuleta Mesa in Dulce, NM. I visited Dulce, NM on December 13, 2004 in order to hike the famous Archuleta Mesa. I hiked around and took quite a few photo's in order to study later.  I only recently discoverd what seems to be a small ufo hovering over the Archuleta Mesa. I can't quite make out details of the U.F.O.  All I know is that it's not a bird, plane, or helicopter.  The sky is Blue as can be, not a cloud.  If you would like me to e-mail you the photo then I will do so.  ((name deleted));36.8598;-107.0602
