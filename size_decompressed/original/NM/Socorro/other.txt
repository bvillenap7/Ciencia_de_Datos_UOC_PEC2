Falling object.;1999-08-15 22:30:00;5-7 sec;Falling object I was diving NW on a dirt road N of Socorro, when I thought a flash of lighting lit up the hill side.  But, it lasted for 3-4 sec.. I could see nothing at the time.   I leaned foward toward the dash and saw a fireball above high clouds.  It was lighting up the clouds.  It passed through or from behind the clouds.  The object was moving from the north toward the west at a steep angle.   As I watched, it broke up in to 3-4 objects, and then all dimmed and went out.;34.0527;-106.8895

Sky was light blue as the Sun was already behind the Mountains. Object was round and white with center larger and brighter then Mars sighting at 23:00. A white aurora surrounded it with two pulsating points. If the object were a clock the points would be at 10:00 and 2:00. The points grew short then long (At first I thought this might be a new two tailed comet). I took my view finder off of my telescope and observed that the object was divided into three colors. The left edge was purple, the center was lime green, and the right was an orange/yellow color. Couldn't utilize my telescope due to the Tripod being attached to our Jet Ski. As we continued for our Arizona destination, all inside the truck kept observing it. At this time it was fully dark. Small cloud formations were seen moving under the object at various intervals, until it just disappeared.;34.0527;-106.8895
