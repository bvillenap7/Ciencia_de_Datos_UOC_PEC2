I was driving down a local Street, when I looked to my right (east) and I saw three circular objects, somewhat star shaped in the sky they were in a straight line horizontally they began flashing they were a reddish orange and then would seem like turned to White.  They started flickering on and off,then it looks like one of them moved upward and then back down and as soon as started it ended and they were gone.  I thought that it might be a plane or a falling star but the more I think about it I know it wasn't anything like that.;34.0527;-106.8895
