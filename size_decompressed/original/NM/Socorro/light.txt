Driving North on I-25 south of Socorro, NM, my mother and I saw a bright light to the west that followed us to Albuquerque.  ((Venus?));2004-05-03 21:00:00;2 to 3 hours;Driving North on I-25 south of Socorro, NM, my mother and I saw a bright light to the west that followed us to Albuquerque. We were driving North on I-25. We had planned on stopping in Socorro, NM. for gas and dinner on our way back to Colorado. To the west, along the skyline, my mother noticed a bright light. I commented that it probably was a planet. The light was very bright, white and it did not flicker like a star or planet would. The object stayed with us from Truth and Consequences until we hit the out skirts of Albuquerque. The object did not follow the rotation of the stars. When he hit Albuquerque, the object was moving in a North West direction. The moon had not moved at all in the sky. Please note, it took almost 3 hours for an hour long drive, and resulted in us arriving home 3 hours later then we should have. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect Venus.  PD));34.0527;-106.8895
Silent red lights over Socorro, NM.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness experienced in the field of astronomy.  PD));2010-01-22 18:00:00;20 minutes;silent red lights over Socorro NM Stepped outside and saw 5 red lights about 70 degrees in elevation and to the southeast.  They appeared to be about a few thousand feet in the air and hundred to a few hundred feet apart.  Four made a sort of square configuration and 1 was trailing behind.  They did not seem connected.  They were headed from the northeast towards the southwest.   It was partly cloudy and the clouds were moving generally to the east.    As the lights moved overhead I noticed an additional 3 trailing behind by a couple of hundred feet and separated a couple of hundred feet.   I watched for about 5 minutes until they disappeared into the clouds.  At there rate of speed it would take about 1 minute to cover ~90 degrees of sky.   I then went inside for about 5 minutes and then back outside to see if there were more lights.  There were 2 more lights, separated by about the same distance apart, and they also appeared to be coming from the northeast.   At this point, I climbed to my roof to see if I could see any more approaching from the horizon.  I could see a red light traveling above the rio grand river, ~ 5-10 miles away, but heading south.   After watching for ~ 2min and this light disappearing, I waited for another 5 minutes and didn't see any more lights. I teach an astronomy lab at the university, so I am familiar with celestial objects and what conventional aircraft look like at night.  These objects were silent, small, and very bright.  The center of the light was a bright white - red, and seemed to glow solid red.  I've never seen anything like it.   I'm curios if anyone happened to video tape the objects or get a picture. Please contact me if you have any questions.;34.0527;-106.8895
3-4 yellow round lights in a triad and a string over the northern end of the WSMR east of Socorro NM on 11.29.11 about 1830.;2011-11-29 18:30:00;2-3 minutes;3-4 yellow round lights in a triad and a string over the northern end of the WSMR east of Socorro NM on 11.29.11 about 1830. We were driving south from Albq. on Tuesday night (11.29.11) and had reached Socorro between 1800 and 1830 (best guess).   Just south of Socorro I looked to my left (I was driving) in the direction of the rising Orion constellation which was just above the horizon and over the northern end of the White Sands Missile Range near the Trinity site.  I saw:  1. Three yellow lights in a small triangle also above the horizon.  I couldnâ€™t assess the distance.  They traveled south for 2-3 seconds and then disappeared. 2.  Less than a minute later three lights in a triad appeared further south, and again appeared to be above the horizon. They were positioned above the door mirror of my truck. 3.  Almost immediately four similar lights appeared, at the same moment, further south from the second triad (which were still in the sky). These four lights were in a string the light which was on the northern end of the string was slightly lower than the second light in the string, which was to the north and slightly lower than the third light, which was, again to the north and slightly lower than the fourth light. 4.  They stayed in the sky without appearing to move for 2-3 seconds. The traveler in my truck also saw them.;34.0527;-106.8895
Around 8:30 pm last night noticed multiple bright white lights SE of Socorro in the Escondida are in the East mountains.;2016-10-13 20:30:00;3 hours;Around 8:30 pm last night noticed multiple bright white lights SE of Socorro in the Escondida are in the East mountains.  Lights started appearing stationary in one area, piled up, vertical then horizontal.   At one point, when moved towards NE, above the mounts, they all turned off then there were sparkles in a square then turned off.  Then, the lights started moving NE and then turned off.   At times there were between 3 7 lights at a time.  They appeared quickly and turned off suddenly.  They did not linger and were visible around 20 seconds at a time.  I tried taking a picture but nothing appeared on the camera.  The moon appeared clearly but not the objects and they should have been visible.;34.0527;-106.8895
