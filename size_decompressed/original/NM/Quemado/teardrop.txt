We were driving east on NM Route 36 less than a mile west of the intersection with NM 117 about 20 miles north of Quemado, NM on a clear May afternoon when both of us saw an object moving in the direction we were traveling from west to east. To one observer, the object was an extremely bright silver teardrop less than 1/6th the thickness of a little finger when held at arm's length. To the other observer, the object was an extremely bright silver ball with a short comet-like tail. Both agree on the size. The object first appeared at the top of the windshield and looked like it was descending at about 45 degrees or more. At the end of the sighting, the object disappeared as it seemed to level out relative to the horizon. The total time of the sighting was less than one second which indicated to the observers that the rate of speed was much greater than any known craft could attain. The two observers had never experienced this type of sighting in their 70 plus years, and neither are involved with drinking or drugs.;34.2652;-108.7578
