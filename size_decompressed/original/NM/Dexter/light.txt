Lights near Roswell no;2019-10-04 21:00:00;3 minutes;Lights near Roswell no While diving home from Roswell on HWY 285 between dexter and Hagerman two lights appeared  to the west first thought helicopters then one darted up and the other went horizontal then reversed right back to their location then two more lights zipped in and they bobbed and weaved doing things normal plans donâ€™t do . I was not in a position to stop my car and could not get to my phone to take a video this went on for 3 minutes give or take then they they darted to the west and were gone . And no flashing or blinking lights I grew up on air force bases.;33.1925;-104.3839
