Bright blue and yellow glowing orb streaking accross the sky at warp-speed;2007-04-25 23:30:00;1min.;Bright blue and yellow glowing orb streaking accross the sky at warp-speed I was working at my desk on my computer, which is in front of a window, facing west. All of the sudden, I heard and felt a whirring sound and vibration over the top of my head, which caused me to look up and out of the window. There, in front of my eyes, outside, as if it had just passed over the roof of our house, was a glowing, very crisp, bright blue orb with yellow light, shooting off into the horizon, disappearing as if at warp-speed.  It all happened so fast, I barely had time to gasp.  And yet, it was so very clear, there was no mistaking it really happened, and was not anything like I have ever seen before, and it moved so fast, like something not of this world.

Translucent Spherical object Motionless in sky for extended period;2007-09-13 13:50:00;20 minutes;Translucent Spherical object Motionless in sky for extended period As I was finishing my lunchtime workout at the Salvador Perez Fitness Center about 13:50 MDT, a couple of the fitness center staff and another gentleman were visible outside through the window, staring up at the sky. When one of them came back inside, a woman working out near me asked him what they were looking at. He said “that UFO that’s just hanging up there!” She and I both immediately went outside to look.  We saw, about 30 degrees from the horizon, a spherical object hovering motionless over SSE Santa Fe. It had the transparent appearance of a soap bubble, and was about 1/8  the size of my thumbnail held at arm’s length.  The woman who walked out with me instantly cried “that’s a weather balloon!”, and went back inside, cursing the staff person for a fool. And it may well have been a weather balloon, I don’t know where to look up stuff like who’s lofting weather balloons, where and when. I’m hoping you guys can do that.  Her conviction convinced me for the moment, and I went back inside to shower and change.  However the object was still there when I came out to go back to work, and it had not  moved in the slightest, for at least 15 minutes or more.  I carry a pair of inexpensive 2x8 opera glasses with me in my truck for observing wildlife. Using those, I got a better look at it, and it was perfectly spherical, not the teardrop shape I associate with weather balloons, nor was there any observable gondola or dependent payload hanging beneath the object, nor any visible tether that could explain its complete lack of motion. It was a calm day, but one would think there would be some breeze at the apparent height of the object, which seemed to be about 500 to 1000 feet.  The object remained in place all the way back to work, and was still there when I went inside my building, approximately 20 minutes after I first went to look.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037

Orange orb traveling at low altitude from north to south, seen by three people;2019-07-18 20:00:00;2 minutes;Orange orb traveling at low altitude from north to south, seen by three people Orange orb traveling at low altitude from north to south in a straight line and constant speed. 1,500 - 2000 ft, as fast as a plane or somewhat faster.  No sound at all.  Brighter orange spherical nucleus toward front (direction of travel) with less bright orange translucent orb behind.  As it passed, we could see a slight pulsation in the larger orb area, more subtle than a blinking light.  Continued in a straight line until out of sight to the south.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Flashing green, red foreign object hovering in sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius??  PD));2020-04-03 23:30:00;30 minutes;Flashing green, red foreign object hovering in sky I saw something blinking up in the sky with multicolor lights.  After watching for a minute I got curious so I grabbed the binoculars.  It was a clear sphere shape outlined in many quick flashing colors green, red, white.  It hovered in the distance for quite a while.  It went further into the distance, southwest direction.  It’s not my first time seeing something like this.  My wife saw this one too, she came to the window and watched it with me.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
A white sphere flying from north to south over Santa Fe NM approximately 6pm 11/15/2020;2020-11-15 18:00:00;3 mins;A white sphere flying from north to south over Santa Fe NM approximately 6pm 11/15/2020 A friend and I were standing in the parking lot of his apartment complex. Facing east we were remarking about a bright orange white Starlike object about 35 degrees off the horizon which we decided was probably the planet Mars. I then turn my attention to an object heading from the north headint south. It was flying kind of like an airplane but it did not have any blinking lights it just looked like a small white light sphere. It was luminescent but not particularly bright. Unfortunately my phone battery was dead otherwise I would have filmed it. But was almost beautiful in its simple elegance, like a polished pearl. It was siIent and produced no contrail. It was pretty high up and made very small adjustments to its trajectory but pretty much went in the same direction, north to south the whole time. It's speed seemed pretty constant and steady the whole time but may have slowed down slightly at times. I Wanted to report this sighting in case anyone else aro! und town saw it. Would be awesome if this could be corroborated by other witnesses. This friend and I have both seen UAP on other occasions and so we were not shocked or surprised by the presence of this orb.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
