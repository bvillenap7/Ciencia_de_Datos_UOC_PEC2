Don't get me wrong, I don't think this was a space ship.  I witnessed an object in the sky that was brighter than Mars.  I grabbed a low powered telescope that I own and took a closer look. It had a short round tear drop shape with five distinct trails.  The longest trail was the center, and immediately following the center trail was, what I thought to be a moon.  Several observations lead me to believe this was more than common siteing of a planet.  The first was a bright D shape in the middle extending from the top of the tear drop.  An arch extended from the center of the straight part of the letter D downward toward the bottom of the raindrop.  The other thing that grabbed my attention is the fact that the darn thing was moving.  It was everything I could do to get four good looks at the thing.  I drew a couple of pictures of what I saw, but when I went to take another look at the thing it was gone. ((NUFORC Note:  We have had several similar reports from NM, AZ, and TX recently, which makes us wonder whether there may be a high-altitude, helium-filled research balloon in the skies above those states.  That is just a guess.  PD));35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
