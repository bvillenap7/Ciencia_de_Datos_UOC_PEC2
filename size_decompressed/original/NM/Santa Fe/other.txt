THE TIME IT TOOK PLACE WAS THE DAY BEFORE THE ARIZONA SIGHTS OF MULTIPLE SHIPS.;1997-03-12 23:00:00;2 minutes;THE TIME IT TOOK PLACE WAS THE DAY BEFORE THE ARIZONA SIGHTS OF MULTIPLE SHIPS. DRIVING IN FROM ALBUQUERQUE I NOTICED A WIERD SOUND IN MY TRUCK. I THOUGHT IT WAS THE RADIO SO I TURNED IT OFF AND THE DEEP BASE SOUND STILL WAS THERE. WHEN WE ARRIVED AT MY BROTHERS HOUSE IT GOT LOUDER. AT THAT TIME MY WIFE AND I WERE LOOKING AT THE COMET. AS WE GOT OFF THE TRUCK THE NOISE WAS STILL THERE, AND IN FRONT OF US AT ABOUT 1/4 MILE AWAY WAS A HUGE LIGHT GREY CRAFT WITH WINDOWS ON THE FRONT OF THE SHIP. I COULD SEE INSIDE AS IT GOT CLOSER. THE BOTTOM OF THE SHIP WAS LIGHT GRAY. MY WIFE COULD HERE IT BUT COULDN'T SEE IT. I RAN INTO MY BROTHERS HOUSE AND TOLD HIM TO COME OUTSIDE AND LOOK. AT THAT TIME THE SHIP WAS OVER THE VILLA LINDA MALL AND STARTED TO TILT UPWARDS AND THEN IT VANISHED. ((NUFORC Note:  If the date indicated by the witness is correct, it would have been 12MR97.  We have entered that date here.  We have a written report from a witness in Hendersen, NV, for 12MR97 which also describes a large object in the evening sky.  PD));35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Cane shaped UFO seen in Santa Fe, NM on 8/30-31/04.;2004-08-31 02:00:00;Unknown;Cane shaped UFO seen in Santa Fe, NM on 8/30-31/04. This is going to sound loopy but I actually live in Los Angeles and had an out-of-body experience where I was walking down a street in Santa Fe, NM sometime during the night of 8/30 and 8/31/04 (think that technically it was in the a.m. of the 31st).  As I was walking down this darkened street, I saw the odd shaped ship I'll enclose a drawing of.  I recall being very calm about it and thinking to myself, Well, THAT'S not what I thought a UFO is supposed to look like.  I clearly went there to meet it.  I have a history of weird things happening in my life anyway, so this isn't all that unexpected I guess.  I drew what I could remember, though it was foggy...so may not be perfect.  The general shape is pretty good though.  Where I might be off is where the portholes/lights were.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Reddish-orange lights in diamond formation with a trail of lights following behind or below seen by family in Santa Fe skies;2013-11-12 21:15:00;15-30 minutes;Reddish-orange lights in diamond formation with a trail of lights following behind or below seen by family in Santa Fe skies My two brothers, my niece, my brother-in-law and I saw lights Tuesday, November 12, 2013, at around 9:15 p.m. toward the Northeast of our front yard, in the direction of the Ski Basin, or Santa Fe Baldy.  These lights were up in the sky, OVER the mountains in the DIRECTION of the Ski Basin.  There were four lights, kind of in a diamond formation, with a trail of additional lights clustered beneath the first lights.  They kind of went from a reddish-orange color to yellow and, finally, as they faded off across the sky in the distance, they got lighter in color, almost a whitish-yellow. My brother noticed an airplane flying in the vicinity at the time.  We don't know if there is any connection between the plane and the lights or they just both happened to be there at the same time.  The plane did not seem to be following the lights or escorting it or anything like that. I tried to take a picture of them with my cell phone and I also tried to videotape them, but the photos did not come out nothing on the videotape either.  All I got was black sky and the lights from the neighbor's house across the street.  Maybe, if I had used my regular digital camera instead, I would have gotten better results.  Oh, well!   My brother and my niece took off in our niece's car, trying to follow the lights and get a better look with binoculars.  They went all over the place, looking for a better view that was unobstructed by trees or buildings, but, by that time, the lights had already flown off into the distance.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
When I looked up in the sky in a southern direction is saw four circular shaped crafts which were kind of blurred in a cloudy haze. The;2014-11-27 10:30:00;15 minutes;I decided to walk out of my hotel room to look at the stars and what I saw was my first UFO sighting.   I was at a hotel resort which was slightly north of Santa Fe  and directly east of los almos national laboratories.  I walked out the door, which face to the south.   When i looked up in the sky in a southern direction is saw four circular shaped crafts which were kind of blurred in a cloudy haze.  The objects had a faint white glow to them.   The objects flew in a very ordered pattern.  I can best describe them flying on a flower pedal' path.  All the objects would fly to the center and shoot out and loop back around to the center and do it again and again. When I saw this i immediately showed my brother and he saw it also.  I went to go show my parents, but by the time they looked the lights faint glowing objects were very difficult to see and almost disappeared.

Early morning clouded light in eastern sky...no clouds in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus.  PD));2015-11-24 05:40:00;12 minutes;Early morning clouded light in eastern sky...no clouds in the sky. As I was driving to work (pre-dawn) I looked to my left up into the sky. I was driving south at this time. I saw, what I thought was a star in the sky peering through a cloud. As I turned east I looked in the sky again.  I noticed that there was not a cloud in the sky. The sky was clear with all other stars shining bright. I kept an eye on this light and it didn't move, however, the cloud was still around this light. I parked my car in the parking lot of work. While there are parking lot lights they are not overly bright. I watched the light from the lot for about 15 seconds and went inside. After about 15 minutes inside I came back out and the cloud with light was gone. At this time the sun light was just coming over the mountains. ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus.

Crescent like object spotted and slowly disappeared twice at two different locations in the night sky.;2016-09-05 21:30:00;45 minutes;Crescent like object spotted and slowly disappeared twice at two different locations in the night sky. At 9:30pm I was driving south on I-25 looking west and saw what I thought was the crescent moon.  However, there was then a line that came across the moon, and did not change as anticipated if it were a shadow, cloud or a power line.  Then the moon began to slowly disappear.  I first thought this was a lunar eclipse.  However, as I continued my drive towards Albuquerque, turning south, I witnessed the same thing in the southern sky.  This was in a different location, and the same crescent shape disappeared in the exact same way, with the same line across it.  If this were an eclipse it would have reappeared rather than disappear again.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037

Flying red donut shape, noiseless.;2020-09-05 19:05:00;3 minutes;Flying red donut shape, noiseless. Looked like a red donut flying with the donut center pointed to the horizon.  Very clear, light evening sky.  It rotated back and forth showing the hole in the center.  It was moving in a direction opposite of the cloud motion, but appeared to be much lower.  Made no noise.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037

Flash was quick and indescribable, light projected caused a weird sensation to skin and irritation to eyes. Flash seemed almost like the “ neuralyzer” from movie MIB as crazy as that sounds it’s the best way I can explain it. Nonetheless it was strange and unworldly.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
