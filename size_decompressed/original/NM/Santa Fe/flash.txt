Many flashing lights in the eastern night sky above Santa Fe;2007-10-27 23:00:00;5 minutes;Many flashing lights in the eastern night sky above Santa Fe Returning home from the center of Santa Fe, my girlfriend and I just got off I-25 heading south on Highway 14 to Cerrillos. My girlfriend asked if I could see the flashing lights in the eastern sky. At first I thought all I could see was the reflection of my dash lights on the window, but then I looked several times and suddenly I did see blinking lights in the sky.  I pulled the car over to the shoulder and rolled down the window. In the eastern sky there was a large band area about a 45 degree angle from the horizon that had satellite looking blinking lights, but there were many, perhaps as many as 50 or sixty, that at each blink were in a different position, none being in a sensible trajectory.  The lights were so amazing I turned off the engine and my girlfriend I both got out of the car and stood at the side of the road and continued to watch the lights flash as they headed in a north east direction. We both concurred we were seeing something that was not like any aircraft we had ever seen.  Suddenly one of the lights stayed on and shot across the whole eastern sky. If it had been an aircraft it would have gone hundreds of miles in a matter of a split second. The other lights continued to flash, sometimes very close together sometimes far apart, but like they were traveling together as a large spread out band.  After maybe four or five minutes they gradually disappeared going in a northeast direction. My girlfriend and I agreed we had never seen any aircraft, satellite or shooting star that looked anything like what we had just seen.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Green-blue, thick, falling star-like flash.;2016-01-23 19:45:00;5 seconds;Green-Blue, thick, falling star-like flash January 23, 2016, around 7:45 pm, my boyfriend & I were driving southwest on Hwy 599, Veteran’s Memorial Highway in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  We saw in the northwest sky a very thick, bright green and blue (same tone as those colors in a rainbow) flash of light that moved at the same speed and in the same arch as I would expect a falling star to move.  If the sky is a half dome, I estimate its height to be at the one third mark of the sky’s full arch from the horizon, so a little higher than the halfway point to the top of a dome. It was a full moon, so perhaps it was just a falling star that somehow reflected moonlight?? I thought it might be a satellite that blew up, but certainly some celestial being very far away, just way thicker and green & blue, which I’ve never seen before.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
15 flashing lights in a vertical formation traveling in northern sky east to west with two fighter jets flying at them.;2018-12-08 22:30:00;2 minutes;15 flashing lights in a vertical formation traveling in northern sky east to west with two fighter jets flying at them. My son heard a loud unusual humming noise and saw formation of lights in a vertical pattern in the northern sky.  He called my other son to come and see the lights that were traveling east to west in the northern sky over Los Alamos, NM.  The called me out and I saw the formation which is one of the most unusual sightings I have seen.  I ran into my house and captured the lights flashing with my phone video as they disappeared.  We also witnessed two fast flying I assume fighter jets that flew right at the formation. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible military exercise??
