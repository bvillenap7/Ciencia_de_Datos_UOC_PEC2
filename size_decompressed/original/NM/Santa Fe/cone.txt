We observed them through bionoculars and saw 9 objects that hovered, pulsated with light ranging from green to red light. These were not commercial craft...because all planes were grounded on this day 9/11/2001. They seemed not to move, perhaps only slightly...appearing to get smaller or larger in size, only slightly. The light changed in a free flow manner from one color to another. They all appeared to be the same size, with the exception of one, which was larger, bright yellow light. There was some 'hazing' around some of these objects. One object was much larger in the southern sky...it was light colored. The others with the colored lights hovered in the westerly and northern sky areas. These sightenings occured after the tradgey in NYC...that same night. They hovered over 9/12/01 as well...the next evening in approx the same positions by 5 different people. ((NUFORC Note:  Source is anonymous, save for an e-mail contact.

Fiery object moving south to north which separated into approx 5 small objects which trailed it in a straight line;2006-10-03 23:15:00;approx 1 minute;Fiery object moving south to north which separated into approx 5 small objects which trailed it in a straight line On October 3, 2006, at approximately 11:15 p.m. while looking to the west, we witnessed a very large fiery object in the western sky slightly above the mountains.  It appeared to burn with a bright white color.  The object moved in a left to right (south to very slightly northeast) direction and seemed to hold a relatively flat trajectory across the sky.  The sighting lasted approximately 60 to 90 seconds.  As the object moved away to the north, it separated into at least 5 individual, small orange objects that trailed it in a straight line.  The small objects diminished in size with the largest directly behind and the smallest at the end of the line.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Green Lights land in my yard!;2011-10-25 18:00:00;15 min;Green Lights land in my yard! I have pictures! I did not see them with my open eye. It was Dusk when I looked outside and saw the moon . it looked spooky.  So I grabbed my camera and walked outside and took 3 or 4 photos.  I then went back inside to see them.. Upon opening the photos I saw a blue light moving around the frame by the moon..  It looked strange so I went outside again to take some more pictures and see if it was still there. I then placed my camera on the deck railing on my outside deck ant took about more photos with 5 second shutter speed to capture the light at this dark hour.  I took about 12 photos.  The hole time looking for this blue light that was moving in my frames.. I kept clicking until I did not see it in the frame any longer.  I then decided to take a few mor just to be sure. I then went inside to see what I had captured. I opened photos and to my surprise there were three green things in my yard. they seem to be moving in the frames and almost coming tward me. I would like to send photos ..  Please contact me if you would like to see them. Thank you.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
