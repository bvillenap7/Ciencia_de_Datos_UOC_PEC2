While driving on a straight road heading toward Santa Fe, NM, visually the road became wavey my body became paralyzed, and I lost consciousness of immediate area. Gained superconsciousness for a short time before I was brought back into my body -- and I was still driving down the road.  I did not see any bright lights nor UFO's during this experience.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Groups of bright shiny lights in the sky moving around during the daytime.;1987-09-20 16:00:00;15 minutes;Groups of bright shiny lights in the sky moving around during the daytime. Back in 1987 I was attending collage in Santa Fe New Mexico.  At approximately 16:00 hours myself and two friends were on campus near a field shooting at gophers with bows and arrows.  One of my friends shot an arrow straight up in the sky and while we were watching the arrow go up we noticed a lot of bright, white colored shiny dots way up in the sky.  We counted at least thirty of them. They were in a cluster shape and were moving around.  Some appeared large and some very small.  They seemed like stars, they twinkled.  We also noticed a commercial airline jet flying overhead leaving a trail.  By comparing the jet to the objects it seemed as if the jet was flying through them, also some of the objects seemed way above the jet and the larger ones below the jet.  One of my friends went running back to the dorms to get his binoculars.  The sky was blue and cloudless with no wind.  The objects moved slowly to the Southwest.  I am interested in what you think these objects were and if any one else has seen them.  My friend said they were silver colored and round shaped, by the time I got to look through the binoculars they were gone. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

1997 Santa fe, MN A enormous metropolis looking ship landing and our memories wiped away, lost time;1997-04-01 22:00:00;10 seconds;1997 Santa fe, MN A enormous metropolis looking ship landing and our memories wiped away, lost time   I am not exactly sure this is the right date or month but I am certain it was spring of 1997.  I was outside my college dormitory and we were having a school event.  I am Native American and we were having a drum and dance social event.  I was singing with the other singers when one of the drummers pointed to the northwest and said “Oh my god! Look at that!”  I turned and looked it was night time out when I turned and looked I thought we would be crushed in a few seconds by the enormous ship we saw.  It seemed to be landing.  It was so enormous I can only say that it looked like a large metropolis landing.   It made no sound but had a strange energy that you could “sense or feel”.  It had millions of little lights all over it and in many colors.  It was like a city because it was not a uniform shape.  It had many appendages and parts to it.  It was so big it seemed to nearly block out that part of the sky.  I was standing there and just complete shock hit me.  That is all I remember.  When we “came to” or became conscious again I felt dazed and like the memory of it was fading so quickly that I had to meditate quickly to hold it in my mind.  Everyone else seemed to just go back to what they were doing and when I tried to get them to talk about it or even come with me to go search for it, they seemed like zombies.  At the time I was pregnant, I don’t know if that was a factor in how I might have been treated if we were abducted or if our minds were manipulated at all.  I was a peer counselor at the time at the schools student drop in center “The Healing Circle”.  I ran A.A. meetings and held traditional “Talking Circles” for the Native students who needed support emotionally and we had our own licensed Psychologist on staff as well.  He was standing right next to me and witnessed this too. I believe we lost some time too. He was the only one who wanted to go running after this thing.  I eventually convinced some friends who were not there to witness it to take me to look for it.  We rode around in the car for a bout two hours.  We couldn’t find anything and it should have been right on top of us if! it was going to really land anyway.  While we were driving around we did see military jets circling the area for quite awhile.  I believe people called the radio stations and 911 too.  I can’t confirm that though.  The strangest thing was that I did forget the incident for about 5 years I could not remember it.  One day I was working with some youth, I am now a social worker, we were driving toward Minneapolis’s downtown and we could see the skyline.  We were talking about strange things like Bigfoot and UFO’s when suddenly the memory came flooding back instantly.  I was overwhelmed and that same shocked feeling came over me. I still don’t remember what happened though between the times I saw it landing and then the next second “poof!” it was just gone, completely vanished.  I have never reported this before.  I found this website and thought it was time to tell the story.  I have looked online for a picture of a UFO that would be similar to what I saw but I haven’t.  I am Native American and my tribe believes in Aliens completely.  I do too, especially now. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Three extremely bright objects observed in various locations over the skies of Santa Fe and Los Alamos, New Mexico.;2001-06-15 03:00:00;O4:30 +;Three extremely bright objects observed in various locations over the skies of Santa Fe and Los Alamos, New Mexico. Last night as I was going to bed at 3:00 am I noticed an extremely bright light in the skies over the city of Santa Fe.  My home is in the mountains and I have a very good view of both the city of Santa Fe and the city of Los Alamos. I observed this light for a while and noticed it seemed to have different colored lights flashing or something.  I got out my binoculars, and observed that there were indeed different colored lights.  It was too far away to observe the actual shape.  The object at first appeared to be stationary over the city of Santa Fe.  It did not appear to be moving at all.  However over a course of approximately an hour and a half, it very slowly moved over the city of Los Alamos, then very slowly moved lower in the skies until it appeared to disappear behind a mountain in or behind Los Alamos.  It went down not far from a red flashing light in the mountains, so I thought it might have to do with some sort of test or research going on in Los Alamos.  During this same period of time, I also noticed two other very bright white objects which appeared to be either round or elipse shaped in two different locations in the skies over Santa Fe.  Neither object appeared to be moving.  Both were very far away.  I observed an airplane during this period and compared the plane to these objects through my binoculars.  The three unidentified objects bore NO resemblance to the plane.  Two of the objects were still in the sky when I finally went to sleep at approximately 4 AM.  All of these objects were lower in the skies than the stars.  It was a very clear night.  All of these objects were much brighter than the stars and were easy to distinguish from the stars due to their extremely bright lights and to the fact that they seemed at times to move, although VERY slowly. I have never made a UFO report before or seen a UFO.  I am 52 years old, female, and co-owner and co-founder of a company.  Prior to that, I was a top executive in a major ad agency for 20 years. I have never witnessed anything like this.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
An object with two lights flying across the western sky -- didn't seem like airplane.;2007-03-13 21:10:00;5 Seconds;An object with two lights flying across the western sky -- didn't seem like airplane. I was standing on a second floor balcony with two students talking about physics and philosophy at around 9PM, when one of the students pointed out a couple of lights passing by in the sky. I looked at the object, which had two lights, one following the other, I don’t remember the color of the lights, but I remember the motion of the lights going across the sky. We also observed a bunch of planes in the sky, but these had the distinctive tell sign of blinking red lights. The object we saw didn’t have blinking lights and from what we could tell didn’t make any noise--as it seemed to be relatively close to the horizon. We were looking west.  We stood for a few minutes wondering what we had seen, because it was so unusually--the speed and the lights.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Venus moves by itself?;2007-03-25 21:05:00;30 min;Venus moves by itself? This object appeared in the western sky where the planet Venus would have been, but Venus was already BELOW the horizon.  This object was very bright upon initial sighting about 9:05 pm  and it moved towards the north slightly, by 925pm it had droppped closer to the horizon but had lost half of it's brillance, it appeared to be moving away. It passed over a streetlight at the 12 o'clock position and moved down to a 5 o'clock position from the streetlight when it moved back up to almost a 3 o'clock position from the streetlight. By 940pm it dropped down until it appeared to go below the horizon. During this entire event, the object seemed to be changing colors from a red to an orange to yellow and even light green and blue.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Glowing light  illuminates amorphic shape inside doorway of bathroom,as dogs bark at the roof  outside....;2013-03-14 02:00:00;10 minutes;glowing light  illuminates amorphic shape inside doorway of bathroom,as dogs bark at the roof  outside.... I am a graduate student and I was online completing a final paper, when the computer froze.  My 2 dogs jumped up and raced to the back door (their dog door is located there) and started incessantly barking.  I got up and decided to turn the computer off, because my work was saved,soI could try it again later.  I went to the back door and saw my dogs looking up towards the roof, barking anxiously, almost a howling bark…I tried to get them to come in, but they wouldn’t, so I came inside to get ready for bed.  After I was ready for bed, the dogs had stopped barking, so I got in bed, thinking that they would come in soon, anyway. I was on my side, facing my bedroom doorway. The door was open and I could see the bathroom door directly outside the bedroom door at a right angle to the left.  I looked towards the door as I pulled the covers up, and saw a glowing green light emanating from the bathroom,  In the bathroom doorway, I saw a mass in motion…it seemed like a liquid, like an oil with another colored liquid swirling inside of it.  The light from inside the bathroom was illuminating it, so it was translucent green, and moving slowly, like the liquid in a lava lamp. I was stunned as I watched it turn dark and opaque as it started to form a shape.  I became scared as the shape started to form and I saw a small long thin arm, and what looked like a thin leg……I could not see see any more of the shape, because it was dark and the light had diminished. I closed my eyes.  My dogs started barking again, so I took a deep breathe and opened my eyes,to see only darkness around me. I ran out to get my dogs and stayed up the rest of the night, but nothing more! happened. Please post if any of you in the Santa Fe area have had a similar experience. I am having a hard time, wrapping my head around this…;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Very large object at night, a large cabin lighted at the front, red light at rear, absolutly no navigation lights;2013-05-15 22:00:00;5-10 minutes;Very large object at night, a large cabin lighted at the front, red light at rear, absolutly no navigation lights At approximately 10PM on 5/15/2013 I stepped outside with our dog, I noticed two sets of lights approaching from the Southeast and thought it a couple aircraft flying over.  On second glance I realized that these were not normal aircraft or helicopters.   The front set was actually a green/white glow and looked like a gigantic cockpit or cabin.  The rear set was a read glow which was considering the height about ½ mile to 1 mile behind the first set.  It became apparent the this was one solid object.  I could not make out the center section but could see that it was a more dense area the night sky.  It was moving slowly at maybe 500-600 ft off the ground.  There was absolutely no navigation lights of any kind. There were no lights visible between the front to the back.  When the object got where I could see the rear end, It had steady small white and what looked like blue on both sided in a vertical fashion.  In the center was a very large read glowing light.! The red light never went dark but would flare up to a bright red at a steady pace.  It was not a strobe type light, it was a slow flash. The object reached  a large open area which belongs to the Bureau of Land Management.  At the time it made it’s only sound, a low pitched rumbling lasting for a few seconds.    I observed the object continue on towards the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. I have been unable to associate this with any aircraft I can think of.  The lighting was all wrong for any navigational lights and they were the wrong type.  I thought maybe a dirigible or blimp but it was way too long I would say it was about ½ mile to 1 mile in length.  It did not have the required lighting either.  Also I had spotted a star in the night background and thought that it might pass in front of the star so I could observe the center body but it traveled too low and just under the view of the star.  A dirigible or blimp would have blocked the star from view. We have plenty of helicopters fly here but again they have a specific sound and lighting.   I was not going in the direction of any airport.  I have exhausted all means of explaining to myself what this was.  I cannot associate it with any type aircraft.  This was a clear night, no wind.  I was able to observe this object between 5-10 minutes.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Multiple orange lights ascending then disappearing at a consistent altitude.;2013-11-12 21:15:00;7 minutes;Multiple orange lights ascending then disappearing at a consistent altitude. On Tuesday November 12, 2013 at approx. 9:15 pm MST I was watching television when my wife called from the other room.  I got up to find her staring out the front door toward the South East. She said “look at that”.  To my surprise there were multiple orange lights floating in the sky. We both walked outside to get a better look and stood puzzled as 8–10 lights, moving independently seemed to be slowly ascending into the sky.  They were the same size, brightness and color and resembled very bright stars with an obvious orange hue.  They rose into the night sky in no particular formation and each disappeared once it reached a specific altitude, which was approx. 40 degrees upward from the horizon. They were moving slowly enough for us to watch for several minutes and I even called her parents on the phone to tell them to go look.  They went outside just in time to see the last one ascend and disappear.  My wife said about 6-8 had already gone dark before I got to the door, so there would have been 14-18 all together at the moment she noticed them.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Three red lights in horizontal formation.;2013-11-19 19:00:00;10 minutes;Three red lights in horizontal formation. Saw three red lights in a perfect horizontal formation hovering above neighborhood area looked to be within several hundred feet.  Appeared to be the side of a large hovering aircraft.   Slowly and steadily hovered from the south to the east part of sky for about 10 minutes until the lights slowly went out one by one.  Was silent.  Military aircraft seemed to be in the air before and after incident as I observed trails in sky.   Called friend who lived in same area on phone during incident but they were unable to view it from their residence due to obstruction.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
High speed lights were seen moving at a high rate of speed.;2015-09-22 20:30:00;2 minutes;High speed lights were seen moving at a high rate of speed. This event happened in the early evening, just after dark.  The area is a mixed commercial and residential area on the southern side of Santa Fe.  On this particular evening it was raining, which does not happen particularly often in this high desert community.  I stepped outdoors on my porch to enjoy the moisture, when I saw what appeared to be a ball of light moving in the clouds.  The quick motion caught my attention, but I was unable to discern anything specific once I was looking directly at it.  There were a few brief moments of movement at a high rate of speed, before the object seemed to move directly upwards and away from me. This was unlike anything I had ever seen before.   I live near the local hospital, and I happen to be under the flight path for medical helicopters approaching and leaving the city.  These aircraft are very familiar to me because I see them so often.  In fact, I know many of the flight crews personally since I volunteer at a local firehouse.   The sighting made on this particular evening was not like any contact with aircraft I have ever had in the past.  The primary difference on this evening was that there was absolutely no noise.  My home is a quarter mile from the hospital, and believe me they are quite noisy when they pass overhead.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
