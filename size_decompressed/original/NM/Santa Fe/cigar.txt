large  cigar shaped craft;2001-01-08 07:00:00;15 minutes;large  cigar shaped craft Large silver cigar shaped craft over the downtown area. At first I thought it was a plane, but then as I got closer I noticed it did'nt have wings and a tail and it seemed to be jointed in the center of the craft. It wouldn't move for a long time, and then slowly it glided away going south until it was no longer visual.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Bright blue cigar shape traveling at a high rate of speed over Santa Fe;2020-07-11 21:09:00;5 seconds;Bright blue cigar shape traveling at a high rate of speed over Santa Fe Our home is at roughly 7600 ft., full vista of the western sky.  The object streaked through the night sky. It was low because it went behind the foot hills on the other side of I25.  It appeared, disappeared, reappeared and was traveling at a high rate of speed (we know this because we see the F16s practice out over the Galesteo Basin and know their speed).  There was no sound.  It was traveling on a relatively horizontal path, maybe slightly downward.  It was bight blue in color.  We thought it was a private jet coming in, but it was too fast and was a bright blue object.  It disappeared into thin air along its flight path.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
