bright orange lights spliting into multiple objects over Santa Fe, NM.;2006-12-24 19:30:00;.30 MIN;bright orange lights spliting into multiple objects over Santa Fe, NM. As my wife and I were leaving a Christmas/birthday party near downtown Santa Fe, my wife noticed a bright orange light in the sky just over the tops of nearby homes to th south of our location. The light appeared to be moving southward away from us and the made a slow turn westward. As we watched, trying to figure out what it was, it began to get brighter and then split into two seperate but equally bright objects. We then got in the truck to try to get to higher ground for a better view. Approx. five minutes later we arrived at St. Vincent's hospital parking lot where , approx.2 to 3 minutes later while scaning the sky, the light appeared again. This light was moving in a south easterly direction and stayed visible for about 30 sec. before getting brighter and and spliting into three parts, one from the top and one from the bottom. We waited approx. 7 to 8 min. before we saw another light moving in the same direction as the second. This light came from farther away than the second and was moving at a greater speed, slightly bobbing up and down as it went before the light faded out and was gone. We did snap two shots of the objects on a camara phone, but as we continued to snap a few more shots the camera gave a message of picture failed. The screen on the phone then went hay wire and the screen pixilated in in multiple colors, which has never happened before.

Diamond shaped object in sky at sunset we have video.;2012-09-22 19:11:00;30 minutes;Diamond shaped object in sky at sunset we have video. We came out of a local business a little before sun set 7pm and  there was a HUGE bright light in the Sky. I knew right away that it WAS NOT Venus it was too big and bright. We could tell without an eye aid that it was shaped funny and NOT round. When we got home we used a small single lens device to look at the &quotLIGHT&quot... I could tell it was shaped like a diamond. I ran into the house and grabbed my Canon Power Shot S2 IS camera and recorded a video of it... when we played it back we could tell that it was almost glowing bluish like the lights were coming from the inside of it. Like the new halogen lights in car head lights... It never moved.. it sat there very still and eerie... I came inside and looked up “diamond shaped objects in the New Mexico sky” and found a post from 2007 that talked about the same type of object and others on another site from 2009 spotted in Texas and in New Mexico. They described the same exact object that we saw that seemed to be really bright and then fade into the evening sky. The post links are below where we found some photos and some information from past sightings. When we saw the posts and photos they were just like what we have on video. http://lightsinthetexassky.blogspot.com/2009/10/diamond-shaped-ufo-seen-over-northwest.html   http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/058/S58719.html;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Lights in the sky in a diamond formation with additional trail of lights bgeneath or behind the diamond lights traveling Northeast;2013-11-12 21:15:00;30 minutes;Lights in the sky in a diamond formation with additional trail of lights bgeneath or behind the diamond lights traveling Northeast On Tuesday, November 12, 2013, at around 9:15 p.m., my two brothers, my niece, my brother-in-law and I witnessed lights over the mountains to the Northeast from our porch, in the direction of Santa Fe Baldy and the Ski Basin.  There were four lights, kind of in a diamond formation, with a trail of additional lights clustered beneath the first lights.  They kind of went from a reddish color to orange to yellow and finally, as they faded off across the sky in the distance, they got lighter in color, almost a whitish-yellow.  My brother also noticed a slow-moving airplane flying in the sky at the time, heading in the opposite direction of the lights.  We could not tell if the plane had seen the lights and was following them or not.  I tried to take a picture of them with my cell phone and also to videotape them, but didn't get anything useful on the camera.  All I got was black sky and the lights from the neighbor's house across the street.  Maybe, if I had used my regular digital camera instead, I would have gotten better results.  Oh, well!  Because of the trees and houses partially blocking our view of the lights, one of my brothers and my niece took off in my niece's car, trying to follow the lights and to get a better look with binoculars.  They went all over the place, looking for a better view, but, by that time, the lights had already flown off into the distance.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Bright clear sky and very little breeze, I noticed something flashing, it was even sparkling, flitting erratically.;2019-06-24 14:23:00;10 minutes;Driving home though my neighborhood, bright clear sky and very little breeze, I noticed something flashing, it was even sparkling, flitting erratically.  I noticed it did indeed have a pattern, and it was turning clock wise, the craft was as high as a small private plane would be flying at. I kept my eyes on it after I have come to believe it was something extremely odd.  It then flew very high bu keeper the pattern flashing.  It was still very high and as bright as when I first seen it.  I parked and started to take a picture and another diamond craft flew across my screen and disappeared.  The 1st craft flew higher and disappeared. It had a diamond shine to it like a crystal it was really beautiful and I’ve never sited a UFO before I have photos from high up but hard to ID.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
