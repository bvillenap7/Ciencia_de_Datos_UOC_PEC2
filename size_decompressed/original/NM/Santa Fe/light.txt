Dull red giant bracelet at Santa Fe Baldy mountain,summer 1978, Pecos Wilderness, New Mexico;1978-07-15 00:00:00;15 mins, plus;Dull red giant bracelet at Santa Fe Baldy mountain,summer 1978, Pecos Wilderness, New Mexico I studied journalism, learning to answer who, what, when, where, why, how, how much, and how little for 3 college years. I'm 60 now, but not a professionnal journalist. Now I'm an artist.  In probably July (or August) of 1978, I arrived on trail 254, I believe it was, at the base of Santa Fe Baldy mountain, in the Pecos Wilderness, just east of Santa Fe city, New Mexico.  Checked my watch at midnight there, had walked in 4 miles, and here it began. I saw lots of fog upon leaving the tree covered part of the trail, especially to the West, or left of me. In this fog were small, perhaps 1/4 or 1/2 inch across, lights of a dull red color. They started out a foot or two off the ground, and went slowly straight up, to perhaps 4 or 5 feet, then arched over such as a flair gun would create, but I did not see anything like a flare gun. Some lights may have gone farther,up to 10 feet..  These lights moved slower than any rising anything I had ever seen. I could euphemistically say time slowed down for these rising lights. But this is only a description, not a claim of time slowing down.  After watching this for a few minutes, I walked into the area where the lights were, which had ground brush and a few higher bushes, but the lights disappeared before I could reach them. They were spread out over 25 plus feet parallel to the trail, and launching at random intervals. I went back  to the trail and waited but no new lights appeared. So I walked further on the trail.  There was considerable fog about, and I turned right to sit on a log and rest. After a while, I saw huge red lights, like balloons 100 feet across each. They were linked by a chain of the same dull red color and its intensity as the balloons, indeed as the flair lights now 50 feet back on the trail. This braclet configuration, was laid across the top of Santa Fe Baldy, as if a giant child had dropped it on the mountain, above its tree line (thus Santa Fe Baldy) so that the center of the bracelet was where the top of the montain was and the braclet's balloon fobs were perfectly horizontally surrounding the mountain a few hundred feet down from the top of the mountain. I estimated 2 or 3 such fobs would be behind the mountain, where I could see nothing. I saw either 5 or 7 that were partially or fully in view.  This dull red color was consistent throughout both the fobs and the thin chain that linked them. I was stupefied and opened up a candy bar. There was no noise whatsoever, and I realized there was no 3 dimensional depth to any of the fobs. I took them to be spheres, nevertheless, rather than discs. The fog cleared a small amount and I was more sure of the sphere shapes.  As I sat there some non-corporeal spirit type beings, two, one adult male and one apparently teen male,wearing white robes, sort of like the proverbial ghost,floated in from behind me on the left, a foot or so off the ground. I was used to that having extensively practiced mediumship (I become a human telephone between this world and the spirit world whether for departed humans or never incarnated intelligent beings) but this appearance was the last thing I expected in this event.  The taller adult one telepathized to me: Too many doorways! So what? So what does that mean? Oh... I had been thinking of climbing up for a closer look. Had done it in the daylight before, and even that was rugged. He repeated the warning. Then the shorter, apparent teen (say 17 to 18 years old) said: yes, that I could actually get killed doing it. I thought nonesense, and was unmoved by them. The older one then kept repeating Too many doorways!  Too MANY doorways, I thought, what does MANY have to do with it? I thought about it for some time and pretended to agree not to make an effort to climb Santa Fe Baldy there that night. The spirits levitated back to where they came from behind me.  I chuckled to myself Like Hell!  Daddy and Junior came back and Daddy yelled (telepathically): I said 'Too many doorways!'. I was mad, but yielded. (Damn spirits, I thought, too holy to say more than a word or two. And god forbid there should be a discussion with them. Thank hell for important people! ((No, they weren't demons, just jerks.))  They left and I continued watching. Nothing changed. I saw no movement. I realized the fog probably obscured the dull red something from being seen at all down below some 3,000 feet in Santa Fe. I watched some more, got bored, remembered if this were a ufo something, its power system could be extremely dangerous, and so decided not to spend the night nearby.  I walked away from the mountain for 2 miles and arrived at my reserved camp site at 2am, and the walk was hard because I felt very tired. I couldn't figure out why I should be so tired, and this walk seemed to take forever.  Then, when I got to Spirit Lake, on the near side, I had to walk through a group of 15 or so, late-high school or early college age kids, 2 or so of which were girls. They had no camping equipment, but 2 or 3 other young guys did. I went through them and followed the shore of the 50 yard-acrosss-lake to the far side. There I resolved to awake at 10am completely refreshed. I ate a bit, zonked out, and woke at 10 am completely refreshed. Only the kids with gear were on the far side of the lake, groggily rising. The 15 kids were nowhere and I guessed they were at a camp somewhere not too far away. I ate, packed up, and walked back the way I came, without incident, to the car six miles away.  That's all, for that situation, at least.  There's a lot more, best for another time, when I have more energy. I'm 60 years old and this happened 28 years ago. Thank you for reading.

I am the person reporting dull red light on Mountain Santa Fe Baldy. I am the journalism backgrounded writer.  Loose ends for part one. in 1978, when this occurred,I didn's need, nor used any prescription, nor any hallucinogenics.  As I said, the next morning I woke about 10am, very rested and refreshed, ate and headed back by the same route I came in the night before. No manifestation of the dull red light was anywhere. Everything was completely normal.  The next night in Santa Fe, I saw the same dull red light, in the sky in the southern area of Santa Fe. This time it was a single light, going on and off like a plane might do. Due to the dull red color it appeared slightly fuzzy, and was heading south, slowly, like a light airplane might appear to move.  Off and on for several nights, weeks, a few months such appeared in the night sky. In late 1978, I moved to Denver, CO. With some friends I went during the summer on an overnight backpacking trip in the mountains, about 100 miles west of Denver. That night I saw another one of the dull red lights flying in the sky.  I stopped bothering to look for them. But, 20 years later, I saw a red light and heard a simultaneous sound of a light plane engine, for a few seconds. It was also dull, located just above the buildings east of the intersection of E. Evans and S. University, on the north side of E. Evans. I had just come from Chamberlain Observatory where I had viewed Saturn with their older but powerful telescope. There the astronomer lecturing for 45 minutes, started by telling people who wanted to talk about flying saucers to leave. A legitimate request, since it was his show, that of Denver University, and conventional science. Later, I viewed Saturn through the telescope.  This viewing of a dull red light lasted 5 -10 seconds, and when it went behind the building from my viewpoint, the airplane engine noise also went away.  Why all the continuation of this dull red light, starting in 1978 as on the land of the mountain, plus the flare gun effect, then appearing in the night sky like planes? Then the final light appearing and disappearing in the busy intersection at night?  Kind of every which way but loose. A saying in journalism is: Believe nothing of what you hear, and then only a tiny fraction of that. I'm a long way from a conclusion of what I saw, UFO or not. Someone has a book in which he said Martians have a cave under Santa Fe Baldy where they live and do whatever, but I don't remember the author or specifics. And there's been some remote viewing, which is a close relative of the clairvoyance I have used at times.  Because the continuity of the appearances of the dull red light in whatever shape, bracelet or single light in sky, I record this. The bracelet did not fly, of course. And I was certainly puzzled by the flat appearance of the bracelet's fobs, which could have been due to the fog present thickly at first, and thinner later on, but making a false visual of flatness, even though otherwise it should have been a sphere (each fob).  Heard the saying You make your own karma.? This means whatever you do, you set in motion some of whatever happens next. Go to Santa Fe Baldy and use your wits.  Also, this was in 1978. I haven't been back there since. I did not record these events at the time, that I recall. If I go back into researching these memorable events, I think I'll really want to seek out more current events. I do notice that I almost never, if at all, see accounts of dull red lights in UFO reports.  Finally, there is more to this story than I have told, and I suspect it would take a small book to cover it all. I've seen enough Science Fiction to help with scenarios which could illuminate these events, however indirectly. And I think there are multiple possibilities for the story of these dull red lights, including UFO source and non-UFO sources. And I had no direct reason to believe I was abducted in the 1978 or subsequent sightings of the something.  Thank you for reading this. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting is approximate.

Saw white dot of light moving in zig-zag motion over mountains outside of Santa Fe, NM.;1997-09-15 20:00:00;2-3 minutes;Saw white dot of light moving in zig-zag motion over mountains outside of Santa Fe, NM I don't remember exactly when this sighting happened, unfortunately.  Year and time are my best guess.  It was before we left New Mexico, so I was under 9, and probably over 6, so that puts it in the window of 1996-97.  If I had to guess what season it was I'd say autumn, but I really have nothing to back that up.   We lived outside of the center of town in Santa Fe, by a river gorge that runs from a reservoir to the east of town.  Our house was on the north side of the river, positioned up on the hill slope, with a view across the valley, looking at the Atalaya Mountains to the south.   We had an office room where the computer was, with large windows taking up almost the entire southern wall to afford this view of the valley.  The computer desk sat on the east wall at a right angle to these windows.   It was fully dark at the time of the sighting.  Since we were a little removed from town, you could see the night sky and stars pretty well at our house.   I was playing a computer game, sitting at a right angle to these big windows on my left.  I must have just looked over at the windows because I don't think any sound or light or anything would have prompted me to do so, and I saw a white spot of light, basically the same size as a star, moving slowly from east to west in a zig-zag pattern just above the mountains on the other side of the valley.  Not a very big or dramatic movement, but kind of like drawing the shape of the symbol for Aquarius (in a single line).   It moved at a slow enough rate across a wide enough space that I could watch it long enough to really take in what I was seeing.   I was interested in UFOs, and knew that this wasn't a normal flying pattern for any known craft.  As far as I can remember, the white point of light continued moving westward down the line of the mountain range at a steady rate until it just left view.

The date that I have given for the sighting is an estimated date.  I didn't have a way to officially report the incident until now. For the last 11 years I have had a paper route and for the past 5 years I have had 2 paper routes.  When I finish the 1st one, I sometimes stop to use the restroom in a deserted road area.  It's located in the mountaineous area that goes up to the ski basin outside of Santa Fe, NM.  While I was standing there, I was facing down the mountain. You can easily see the lights from Los Alamos, NM  which is approximately 30 miles away on any clear night.  All of a sudden, I noticed what I thought was a shooting star light up over the Los Alamos area.  It looked like a spark from a sparkler.  The spark shot straight across the sky approximately 3000ft(?) in the air and when it got to where it appeared to be over the Villa Linda Mall area(which would have been about 10 miles from me), there was a number(5?) of what looked like huge flash bulb explosions and they initially were round flashes, but as they grew in size, they were apparently enclosed in something square shaped and the entire square was filled with the bright looking flashes until it looked like one big square flash... Then it went out.  The whole thing took no more than 5 to 10 seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Multiple red lights decending towards earth;2004-01-12 02:00:00;10 minutes;Multiple red lights decending towards earth I was working the gravyard shift as a security officer in Santa Fe, and while making a routine partol I noticed a strange looking red light off in the distance.(not moving)  I stopped and watched it for a couple minutes. After about 3-4 minutes I realized it was starting to move.  I quickly climed up on the roof of the Mall to get a better look.   While up on the roof I watched as this strange light changed from a normal red to a very odd looking red and back again. Then it slowly moved to the left, stopped, and moved to the right.   Then seemingly out of know where a second red light appeared directly below the origonal. Slowly this second light started decending towards earth. I watched it go down untill it was behind the mountains.  I looked back up and there was another one decending in the same way as the first. I watched it all the way down, looked up expecting to see another, but instead it was just the origanal one (I'm assuming). Then poof it was gone. Just like that.  I'm still in awe of what I saw that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
brilliant light skids low across sky without a sound;2006-02-26 18:30:00;2 minutes;brilliant light skids low across sky without a sound I was outside at dusk and looked up to see the stars, as it was just then dark enough. Saw a very bright light moving overhead at a good clip about as fast as a low-flying aircraft appears to move. Thought initially that the light was the landing spotlight of an aircraft but there was (a) no noise whatsoever and (b) the light was unaccompanied by the blinking red and green id lights common to aircraft. Also the light remained steady for the duration of the sighting. The light was approximately magnitude -5 or possibly -6 it was distinctly brighter than venus, and a yellowish-white in color. The light displayed a peculiar sort of sliding motion in additon to its forward vector as it crossed the sky from west to east in about 2 minutes. (we have a big sky in New Mexico). By sliding I mean that it appeared to move slightly north as it travelled eastward, but to do so in a way that made it seem it was an ancilliary to its primary motion eastward. It's hard to describe, but it was like when the wind is perpendicular to the road and it makes your car veer slightly as you're driving. But I the skidding motion of this light was constant and did not seem to vary with the gusting wind that evening. I have seen the ISS and this did not resemble it at all, being far brighter and apparently closer, and moving faster, as my wife who also saw the tail end of the sighting confirmed. Nor did it look like a balloon reflecting the setting sun, as the light was constant throughout the minutes it took to cross the sky, fading out only after it had gone far to the east almost to the horizon, and this was 10 or 15 minutes after sunset. It was also moving far faster than I've ever seen a balloon move, even in high wind. (And the International Balloon Fiesta is about 60 miles north in Albuquerque every year, so I've seen my share of balloons.);35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037

October 2, 2006  At approximately 11:15 p.m., Sunday, October 1, 2006, I woke to go to the bathroom and noticed slowly moving lights on the wall in my bedroom as if from car headlights. I looked out the North facing window out of curiosity and began to question myself because there are no nearby driveways behind and to the North of our 2 and ½  acre property. There appeared to be a low flying object of horizontal white light moving about 5 or 10 mph just 100 ft. or a little higher above the ground,heading South. As I watched and tried to figure out what it was, the white light turned a beautiful shade of bright blue and began to move faster and seemed to turn to the North east before vanishing from my sight. All in all only about 30 to 45 seconds passed from the moment I saw that it was in the air to the moment it turned away and seemed to vanish. No noise was heard by me. The strip of light might have been about 20 ft. long.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Possible UFO over Santa Fe/Los Alamos;2006-10-02 03:00:00;1hr;Possible UFo over Santa Fe/Los Alamos I was house sitting on the west side of santa fe where I had a view of the Jemez mountains and los alamos.  I saw at about three in the morning this bright gold light emerge over the Jemez mountains heading east.  At first it looked like it was an approaching helicopter with alternate gold and red blinking lights.  Then it just kind of sat in the sky and looked like a star, but really close.  I observed it move at a rate much faster than the surrouding stars, until it was out of sight range.   The next day the person I was house-sitting for came in and reported seeing three of the same thing in Dixon, NM, along with 12 other people - without me prompting.  I thought no one would believe me or care even - as I didn't, but they saw it as well, so I decided to report it.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
motionless bright lights dimmed and disappeared with the sundown.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Jupiter??  PD));2007-09-13 19:20:00;35 minutes;motionless bright lights dimmed and disappeared with the sundown I do T’ai Chi at dawn and dusk of every day, outside on my patio. This evening, as I started my workout just after sundown, I noticed two bright star-like objects to the west, about 15-18 degrees above the horizon. One object was extremely bright, perhaps magnitude -2 or -3, and resembled a brighter-than-normal planet Venus. About 10 or 12 degrees to the south of it, at the same height above the horizon, was a lesser light, but still bright, about magnitude -1 or 0. The larger, brighter light was blue-white in color, like Venus, and the smaller was an orange-red, like Mercury when it is visible.  My first thought was, “oh, what a beautiful Mercury/Venus display!” But then I realized that I had seen Venus this morning at dawn, rising ahead of the Sun!  As I had this realization, the smaller light dimmed and disappeared, within about 5 seconds, without changing position relative to the horizon.  I continued to watch the brighter object, and marked it’s position relative to the horizon using some tree branches that were off to one side that allowed me to sort of triangulate the light’s position.  Several airplane contrails were visible nearby, illuminated by the sunset. These came and went while the object remained still.  Over the course of the next 35 minutes, the light did not move relative to the horizon in the slightest. However it also, though much more slowly, dimmed in brightness and turned more and more red, until, once twilight had ended and it was completely dark, it was orange instead of blue-white and perhaps magnitude 6 or 7. A few minutes later it became completely non-visible. Up to the point it was no longer visible, it did not move. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Jupiter??

Bright, multicolor light hovering in air in rural Santa Fe;2008-07-31 00:15:00;One hour plus;Bright, multicolor light hovering in air in rural Santa Fe After leaving work in rural Santa Fe around 12:15am MDT, two coworkers and myself observed a light in the West that was slightly larger than a star, but changed colors. The lights would change rapidly from red to blue to green to white and then it would repeat those colors on a regular time interval, but the order of the colors would change. Red and white would appear simultaneously. We observed the light for quite some time, and it seemed to be hovering incredibly slowly and in a somewhat circular pattern. Occasionally, there would be smaller lights that would “shoot out” from the main light – it looked like sparks. Toward the end of our observation of the light, the light in the sky seemed to move vertically slightly. Our location in rural Santa Fe never has commercial or private aircraft fly over it, and it was far too high in the air to be a helicopter. None of us have ever witnessed a UFO, and what we saw completely defied any explanation that we could come up with. I myself believe in the existence of UFOs, but the other two do not. What made this experience all the more interesting is that even with skepticism, we all believe that what we saw was a UFO and we all saw the exact same thing.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Odd lights - objects in sky.;2009-07-17 00:00:00;minutes;Odd lights - objects in sky. I was on vacation in Santa fe NM.  My friend has a house with a hilltop behind it.  Almost every night for a week we would go to the hill top to star watch.  On one of our first nights my friend, whom I traveled with and I witnessed two fast moving steady lights that seemed very very far up..much higher then any plane.  There was a local airport and planes went in and out of the area - but you could hear the engines and see their blinking lights - this was nothing like that - they were gliding silent and moving at a very fast rate very high up in the night sky. On a succession of nights we had a camera with us and started out just taking pictures of us and then up at the night sky to capture the stars.  The first few nights we took pictures with the flash and got some strange objects.  Orb like orange and blue oval shapes and some other glowing objects - which at first seemed like we had maybe caught some 'alien objects' and we were excited .. but then being the skeptic I dismissed as dust, beetles or dragon flies caught in the flash. Some if you zoom in clearly appear like they could be bugs..others ?? Not sure what they are. Any way, one of those nights when we where showing the pictures we had just taken to our friend who owns the home - we had gone back inside - and had our back to the window that faced the hill - but he was facing the window - He yelled and jumped up because he saw a bright beam of light come down behind the hill.  He's lived there for years and has seen plenty of shooting stars and meteor showers..this he said was nothing like that.  we were too scared to go out and look - though he wanted to.  We did searched around the next morning around the hill but saw nothing. On the final night of our visit it  - was a clear night with lots of visible stars,  my friend and I had gone up to the hill and I said 'ok let me prove my bugs in flash theory - look I'm going to take pictures with out the flash and show you that there really isn't anything out there..'  So I took a series of pictures pointing up into the sky with out the flash.  Then I decided to run some video clips from camera again with out flash. I held the camera to the sky and let it run. Even though my eyes could see the stars the camera's screen really wasn't strong enough to pick up the light of the distant stars except for one very faintly. As the first clip was about to end and I was getting ready to leave the hill a very bright light zigged zagged up from the far bottom corner of my view - seemingly from nowhere. (I almost felt like the object knew I was leaving and wanted to 'show itself'.) The clip ended so I started a second clip and held my camera on the bright object that ! was now very visible on my camera screen and seemed to just hang in the sky - it was a pulsating light.  I panned a little to the right because my eye caught other movement and a much brighter second light moving towards the first light and a third less bright and smaller light also came come into view. My friend had gone down the hill and was calling me to come down.  I was now up there alone and a little freaked - so when the clipped ended - I left the hill. Aside from lots of orb like shots and the video clips we also captured on camera a strange white triangle object in the sky when we were taking a sunset picture.  We didn't see it with our eyes.  But it appears on the shot.  Many of the friends we met who live there - say these lights in the sky are common events and I would have to believe it based on the week I spent there - you need only look up..;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037

Each light can be described as 1/4 the size of the moon. All the objects appeared to look similar to eachother. I noticed that each object moved out of sequence with the other objects but still proceeded north in the boomerang shape. This lasted approximately 15 seconds.  There was also no sound that came from the objects.  The objects faded out as they grew a larger distance from me.  The height of the object seemed similar to as high as a helicopter's common altitude.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037

Mysterious bright colored lights, red and green, moving through the sky.;2013-02-28 18:55:00;~1 minutes;Mysterious bright colored lights, red and green, moving through the sky At approximately five minutes to seven, p.m., I was in my bedroom watching television whens strange lights appeared in my peripheral vision, attracting my attention toward the otherwise darkened sky outside. Turning to the window, I observed a set of bright colored lights, red and green, moving slowly across the sky. They were an unusual color of red and green, like no lights I've ever seen in the sky before in all of my forty plus years. These lights were constant, not flashing or blinking. What I was seeing was obviously not a helicopter, plane or balloon.  It was utterly strange both in its appearance and in its motions, which were unlike the motions of any conventional object seen in the skies.  There were two light sources, one red and the other green, which were aligned horizontally to one another and which retained a constant spatial relation to one another as they moved across the sky. I saw no actual object, just these two lights moving together in very close and fixed proximity to one another, as if they were emitted from the same object (if indeed there was an object). Astonished and curious, I ran outside, not stopping to put on my shoes or coat.  I stood in the snow wearing just my socks (I wanted a good look, and time was short).  I ran outside because the lights were passing directly over my house and the window view would not have allowed me to watch the mysterious object (if these lights were emitted from an object). I sensed something being emitted from this object which was not light, which was very mysterious, and which I do not know quite how to describe or explain.   Perhaps I was feeling sub-audible sound waves, which my body could feel though I could not hear these waves?   I had the strange thought that somehow this thing was aware of my observation of it, but I must admit that this is just a speculation.  I have no actual evidence for this, and might have merely imagined this. I felt as if I were affected mysteriously by the thing, but just how I cannot say.  I felt something strange and perhaps impossible to describe. It affected my senses, especially my hearing, which seemed to be strangely diminished, as if some sort of sub-audible, low frequency sound were emitted from this object. The size of the apparently connected lights varied as the object moved across the sky.  At maximum, at its nearest approach, would be contained by a two inch ring held at arm's length from my eyes. At that moment when I had a feeling that the object were aware of my observation of it, it turned and reversed course, its flight behavior utterly unlike any object I've ever seen before not fitting with helicopters or planes, etc.  The object did not appear to emit sound audible to my hearing, as a plane or helicopter would have under similar conditions. I told my partner (we live together) about this experience by phone, and we talked about it further when he returned home.  As we sat together in our living room discussing it, I was facing a window.  Then it appeared again!  This was well over an hour later, but the time is uncertain. (I didn't look at the clock.) I pointed it out to my partner, who also saw this object, but only through the window, and at greater distance than the closest proximity of my observation earlier that evening. It was unusual enough an experience that I decided to use the internet to explore whether others have seen and reported this, perhaps in the news.  I used search engines to explore this question, and this is how I came to discover this forum for posting such experiences.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Blue light moving very fast twice the size of any star or planet light in the sky;2013-03-26 20:00:00;1 minute +;Blue light moving very fast twice the size of any star or planet light in the sky I went out on my front porch and to the north I saw a very blue light moving straight up and then seemed to make a circle pattern to my left and then toward me then right and away and then straight down below where i could see and then it came back up about half the distance it was at first and then went back down toward the ground.  It was covering way too much distance and moving too fast to be an airplane or anything else i have ever seen.  It was not blinking and was about twice the size of any other light in the sky. Im hoping someone else saw it also.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Two orange lights, like stars, traveling at a very high speed.;2013-04-29 10:50:00;1 minute;Two orange lights, like stars, traveling at a very high speed. Two lights seen mid sky over in the south heading east at an incredible speed about four times that of a satellite, or three times a conventional aircraft.  They were the size of a satellite or star both orange in color, one above and trailing slightly ahead of the lower one and heading in an easterly direction. A slight tragector change was noted as the seemed to get closer.  They became undectable as they got farther away.

It appeared to be somewhere over 30,000 ft. above the Earth's surface and considering that height it may have been quite a large object.  The Light emission and some modulation in the objects shape continued for the full 20 minutes I observed it.   As full dark approached, it faded slowly off into the NW quadrant of the sky, accelerating gradually until it was just a pinpoint of light that might be mistaken as just another star.  As for intensity of the white light, it was within its contained space brighter than the sun in terms of white light luminosity.  I didn't attempt to refract the emitted light to see what color spectrums were present, but such a basic simple measurement could be informative. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the time and date may not be precise.  The witness indicates a time of midnight, but states that the sun was just setting.

The third night I was able to document the ordeal on video.   I, along with my partner observed the light grow brighter and brighter then completely go out. It would repeat this process all of the nights I was observing it.  To the naked eye, the light seemed as if it was staying in one spot.   However, recording it put the object in better prospective, and can be seen moving very suddel.  It was a very enlightening and delightful experience to be able to see this object on more than one occasion.

Blinking lights on for several seconds getting super bright and fadding out , a smoke orb flying low ,giant green orb very fast;2016-07-03 01:45:00;10 seconds;Blinking lights on for several seconds getting super bright and fadding out , a smoke orb flying low ,giant green orb very fast This is getting a little crazy already.  Since I saw my first ufo a few months ago I've been seen them on a regular basis still in search of answer or explanations with no luck .  I'll start by saying I've spent on average 2 hours a night out side looking at the sky and just in the past two nights 7/2/16 and tonight 7/4/16 @ 12-1:45am I saw 3 separate crafrs. Starting with last night.looking toward a mountain range I enjoy looking at where I have seen weird things so I regularly look in the direction to see if I can get any luck on top of this range is a fairly dim  red light(due to distance) that goes on and off as a plane warning to let a plane know there is a huge mountain right there well.  I'll get to the point I was looking that way and I see what I thought was the red light at first but it was alot brighter and bigger didn't think much of it I thought maybe it was just a clearer night well I look about a mile to the left and  sure enough the one I see is! there still dim and remember I look at these mountains every single night and have never seen this light so I look back at the other object and it's blinking but getting brighter then dim then completely fade away for 10-30 seconds at a time then it would reappear in another spot although still close to the first spot and blink then it would even stay lit for 10-30 seconds I called my roommate outside he is not a ufo believer but he knows I have no reason to play games or lie about something like this . And he sees the plane warning light and says that's just a tower to warn planes in case it's dark I said not that. And I pointed and he was in complete disbelief he couldn't even imagine what could hover, blink turn off get brighter and dimmer and even move spots we walked about a 1/4 miles  down the road from our home to get a better look we stayed looking for 30 minutes when all of a sudden. A very bright light seemed to be following us getting brighter to the point we co! uldn't even look the the direction anymore it was blinding we ! got frea ked out and ran all the way home. And we finally looked back and everything was gone and did not come back . Earlier my roommate and I went for a walk to a  bridge close to home where it's super dark at night and I told him I bet we see something he said no way. About 15 minutes of looking we see a ball of what looks to be glowing smoke hovering very low to earth it looked to be far away but close to the ground as it floated along it literally passed my neighbors house it was so much closer than we thought and it went in front of the house passed the house and kept going we attempted to fallow it but it picked up speed and was to quick for us to fallow we watched for a few minutes untill it disappeared though it never change shape never got bigger or  smaller and never got lighter or darker so it couldn't have been actual smoke this was tonight well we finally went inside to watch some TV and wash clothes as I got done hand washing my work clothes due to delicate material th! at will get ruined if put in a machine .I went outside to ring the items out when I noticed two very distant stars that looked super close together so I took out my phone and used the app space junk to identify the stars as I was doing it . I see a flash what seems to the down the road and I look up this object was also very very low to the ground maybe only a few hundred feet it was a green orb biggest I've ever seen. I fallowed it from where I saw the flash and fallowed it as it flew right over my head at a very very high rate of speed and continued looking at the object untill it faded into the night sky this was one single orb I got a good look at it considering the whole event took 10 seconds or less . I want to say I have much better things to do with my time than write this and make things up this is not a hoax I don't need any attention I am just sharing my experience. Call me lucky or cursed  but lately I have seen many unexplained phenomenon in the sky I live in a! mountain area with no light I've tried over and over to take ! pictures with my phone with no luck I am going to invest in a very nice camera I know I'll see more soon . I'd really like to know why I'm seeing so many ufo if they are aliens do they want me to see them its overwhelming so many shapes sizes colors orbs blinking blood crafts it goes on . If anyone can contact me with similar experiences I'd love to chat this isn't a joke this isn't a prank or a hoax I am saying this because last time I saw something very strange . It said possible hoax I honestly felt offended made me not want to post but I'll give it another chance. Thanks;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Light moving slowly south of Santa Fe with strange haze around it which expanded.;2018-02-06 19:21:00;5 minutes;Light moving slowly south of Santa Fe with strange haze around it which expanded. A small light initially about the brightness of Mars or Venus, but as if out of focus which increased in magnitude while slowly moving in our direction approximately south to north.   We were in Santa Fe looking south and it appeared the light was just east or NE of Albuquerque and south of Santa Fe. Then the intensity of the light increased and a haze was illuminated around the light as if something was shining a light inside a cloud or fog bank.  The sky was very clear though and stars were visible adjacent to the light and haze so this did not appear to be a cloud being lit up.  The light appeared to move east slowly at this point.  The size of the haze increased.   I went to get my phone to take video, but when I returned in less than a minute, the illuminated haze was spreading out and the light was fading and appeared to be moving away toward the south.  The it was dark where it had been and stars were visible where the illuminated haze had been.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037

Realized lights of “formation” too large, too bright, too uniform to be natural.  Four vertical, 2 more extending to left at an angle.  A kind of blackish void-like quality around them.

Some sort of crafts - only visible as bright white lights - equally spaced and moving at hyper speed at super high altitude.  Traveling from west to east - roughly the direction of Menkalinan towards Altair.  Super fast and in perfect formation. So fast that they went horizon to horizon in less than one minute. Thought they might be fighter jets, but could see no green/red lights.  Only bright white lights. Wow.  Bizarre.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037

I was hanging upside down from the pull up bar, doing my regular calisthenic exercises when I noticed the long single file caravan of non flashing white light spheres, traveling in a straight line heading North East. I lost count at about 30. There could have been a hundred in all. The line of these light spheres seemed to go from horizon to horizon almost. They were not low in the sky. Unknown distance but pretty high up. They were all single file, one in front of the other except for a single pair which were flying nearly side by side. Their speeds were not perfectly constant in relation to each other as they seemed to speed up/slow down. That's all i've got. I tried to film it but this video quality on my new phone is terrible and didn't pick any of it up. Surely there were other witnesses here in Santa Fe, I just hope they know to report it on this website.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
