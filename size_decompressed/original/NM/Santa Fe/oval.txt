I noticed a satellite moving through the bottom of the Bootes constellation located off the panhandle of the Big Dipper. I continued to watch that same spot and noticed an extremely high, dull orange, fuzzy-edged, oval shaped object move through the center of the 'star ring' in Bootes. It was impossible to estimate the height of this object but it seemed to be extremely high, possibly 40-70,000' moving very fast for that altitude. It was not bright and anyone that was not focused on that part of the sky would not have seen it. After the first object passed, I continue to watch that spot and another object exactly the same and on the same trajectory passed through also 3 seconds later. Continuing to watch that spot, I counted 21 objects move through on exactly the same flight path, three seconds apart, except that one object ! moved through at a slightly higher flight path. I was still on the phone with my friend and counted them out loud to him. I continued to watch the Bootes constellation but no other objects passed through while I was observing.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Very bright light swinging around ascended then ejected 2 objects.;2020-10-25 21:30:00;6 minutes;Very bright light swinging around ascended then ejected 2 objects. On October 25th, 2020, I was in my front yard sky watching and talking to a friend on the phone.  While I was talking with him, I noticed the biggest and brightest meteor I had ever seen in the western part of the sky.  After scanning the sky a bit more, I looked to my right towards the NE and saw what looked like someone was walking with a very, very bright flashlight on the top of the Eldorado Preserve about a mile from our house.  Since it was 9:30pm, I could not understand why anyone would be hiking at that hour way up there.  There are many things to be wary of, especially at night cactus, coyotes, mountain lions and the steepness of the terrain. I went and got my husband to watch the object.  We sat on the bench facing the preserve, watching the light swing back and forth as if someone was walking.  After about 2 minutes, I looked at the light and realized that it had lifted above the mountain. It was ascending.  The light was still swinging around but was getting dimmer and dimmer.  When it was at its highest, about 45 degrees above the horizon, it dimmed until it was almost out.  At that point, my husband and I saw two objects eject from the top towards the right and fade.  After that, the object completely faded also.  There was no further activity that evening. It was impossible to estimate how far away and how high the object was but due to its brightness, it seemed relatively close.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
