UFO floats over, truck stops, distributor is stuck to inside of roof, magnetized.;1999-12-19 02:30:00;10 seconds;UFO floats over, truck stops, distributor is stuck to inside of roof, magnetized. I was driving on 84-285 from near the opera to Santa Fe.  On my right, above my head, coming from the Los Alamos area, appeared the biggest thing I had ever seen in the air.  It floated right over me, from the passenger side to the drivers side and kept going.  It was totally silent but  had a luminescence.  As it went over me, my old (real sheet metal) Ford truck stopped.  I turned off the radio, which was still working.  The truck would not restart.  I had to call a tow truck.  My cell phone worked.  The next day I called my long-time mechanic ((name deleted)) and asked him what was wrong.  He said to call the next day.  The next day he told meYou've got to come see this to believe it.  I've been a mechanic for 40 years and I've never seen this happen.  I went down to the shop.  He said I've seen distributor caps crack, but I've never seen an entire distributor pulled out and exploded.  He opened the hood, and there, magnetized, and stuck to the inside top of the hood, were the pieces of my distributor!  He asked How did this happen.  I said ((name deleted)), you don't want to know!

There were three balls of light flying in a long triangle;2004-04-21 00:40:00;30 sec.;There were three balls of light flying in a long triangle April 21st,12:40pm.  Three circles, flying in a long trialgle shape (<)very fast. I went out to watch what was left of a meteor shower and saw this instead. It was very dark in the sky in back of these shapes.  They appeared to be light (yellowish) but also kind of transparent/slightly glowy. Each had a smaller circle within the circle,like a dot in the middle, which was darker.  The three flew at the same speed in the same direction.  And then disappeared. I often enjoy the evening skys here, and know there is lots of airforce around.  I have seen many different types of planes at night, never anything that looked like this. My husband asked how big they were and if I could put my hand over them when I was watching. Which I believe I could.The time was very short in duration that I was able to see this, but the sky was clear and my first reaction was, Whoe,...what the heck was that! ((NUFORC Note:  One of four reports, submitted in rapid sequence, from the same computer.  We do not know if the reports are serious, or whether they are intended to hoax.  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Not a hoax, just what I saw and an update I entered a report and saw that a notation had been made stating there was rapid fire entry (?)from the same computer and it may be a hoax.  Please know that this was no hoax, and do not discount it just because I may not know how to use this computer properly. I do not remember, but may have thought it did not enter and resubmitted it.  I have never sent one of these and was not enthusiastic about giving out my personal information.  My husband had suggested I write you because he said he has heard about these flying spheres/in a triangle form before and thought it was worth noting. And with that, I will also tell you that on 04/27/2004 at about 10:00pm, I went out in the yard again.  Curious from the night before and now instead of coming from the south to the north I saw crafts going from north to south.  These were not the 3 sphere shaped/triangle I saw on the 21st. I would say 1 every 10-15min flew overhead.  These had noise (the other did not).  These had 3 round lights (not independent spheres). Some of them had 2 yellow and one red light.  And you could see the triangle shape on these.  My impression was that this was some sort of airforce practice run.  Or my personal interpretation was that someone wanted anyone who saw the thing on the 21st to think it was one of these because they were so loud I kept coming out of my home every time I heard one. (I had called your hotline, but it was always a recording).  Thank you. ((END)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.

A bright solid round light above mountain south of Santa Fe, NM.;2008-05-20 07:25:00;30seconds;A bright solid round light above mountain south of Santa Fe, NM. I was driving south on 1-25 leaving Santa Fe, NM. At a distance I notice a bright solid circular light above mountain and sky line. As I was driving I tried to watch it, but it quickly disappeared. My passenger also was unable to keep an eye out for the thing.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Multiple objects above Santa Fe, NM.;2014-08-24 16:00:00;Unknown;Multiple objects above Santa Fe, NM I was sitting outside on a bright cloudless day.  I didn't see anything but suddenly just felt this need to take a photo of the sky almost directly above me with my iPhone.  All I could see was pure blue.  When I took the picture inside and put it on my laptop there were at least 11 and possibly more silver metallic objects in the photo.  Some were extremely high and just specks but a few were much lower/closer.  They appear to be circular metal silver balls like ball-bearings but some of them appear so close together that they look like 2 side-by-side.  They are scattered all over the frame and as mentioned most of them are at an extremely high altitude.   Everyone I have shown the photo to has absolutely no idea what these objects are.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
We saw a round orb red and orange  shoot across the sky, descending in Santa Fe, NM.;2015-09-24 20:30:00;15 minutes;We saw a round orb red and orange  shoot across the sky, descending in Santa Fe NM We were out in the back yard at my daughters house about 8:30 pm. What looked like a round orb on fire shot across the sky from southeast to northwest.  I thought it was going to crash, then disappeared.  There were 6 of us watching it.  Only lasted about 30 sec.  After I left her house, she called me and said she stayed out laying on the trampoline and saw another 3 orbs in triangular formation going the same direction, did the same thing. She stayed out longer but never saw anything else.  The sky was bright and clear. My daughter took a photo on her phone, but it looked like a small white sphere.  It was my first siting of anything like this.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
There was a circular red/orange object over the mountains east of town (Santa Fe, New Mexico ~ Sangre de Cristo Mountains).;2015-12-21 21:00:00;1 minute;There was a circular red/orange object over the mountains east of town (Santa Fe, New Mexico ~ Sangre de Cristo Mountains).  The object appeared to be moving east/south-east.  The entire object was illuminated and the light was consistent with no blinking, which made it clear to me this was not a standard aircraft.  The speed is hard for me to clearly determine but it was not moving faster than would a helicopter moving in the same direction.   I also could not tell the distance but assume it was over the Sangres.   The object headed south/south-east, and then somewhat vertically, at which point I lost sight of it.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037

Huge bright green lights converge into three smaller bright green lights in Santa Fe, NM.;2018-06-29 09:10:00;5 seconds;Huge bright green lights converge into three smaller bright green lights in Santa Fe, NM. I saw a huge bright neon green circular light, it was falling down from the sky, it didnâ€™t look like anything Me or the person with me had seen.  It appeared to look fuzzy because it was behind the clouds not very visible.  As it fell down, about 2 seconds in it converted into three small green neon lights, then it suddenly disappeared.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
