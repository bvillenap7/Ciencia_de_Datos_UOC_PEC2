slow moving object evolves from a light green colored embryo shape to a full saucer with tent top and wht bulb like trim.;2002-11-24 06:25:00;two hours;((NUFORC Note:  Witness has sent 32 video and still attachments in support of his report.  In our opinion, the object is not inconsistent with a large, high-flying, semi-tetrahedral shaped, transparent helium-filled balloon.  The object even drifts slowly across the field of view of the camera, and seems to rotate, or tumble slightly.  Perhaps one of our readers could confirm whether there might have been a balloon launched out of the balloon facility in the Southwest.  PD))  slow moving object evolves from a light green colored embryo shape to a full saucer with tent top and wht bulb like trim. Object appeared, without the use of camcorder, as a bright white round light the size of a pencil eraser in the Southern skies of Santa Fe. As I started to film, the object looked like it was starting to fry like an egg until you started to see the bottom appear to start rolling up from the bottom. The object all the while started to pitch a pointed roof on top as the bottom rolled up to the middle where there was a slow revolving red light. As it continued slowly rotating, the pitch of the roof started to flatten out as round folding table top looking wings started to develop. The object then evolved itself into an object that looked much like a garlic or acorn. This means that the pitched roof on top of object sucked itself in like a flexible piece of aluminum while the bottom body remained looking like the bottom part of a garlic. As I continued to film for 15 minutes more, the object flattened out for another 3 to 4 minutes, meaning you could no longer see the top at all, however, the bottom finally started to flatten itself out horizontally like the traditional frisby like looking disk. As I filmed for another 3 to 4 minutes, the object popped (or should I say sprouted) it's roof up from the inside up then out just like a mushroom or a volcano. Once the new top was on the craft, you could see  small little white light-bulb looking type fixtures around the trim of the disk. The bulbs appear to be revolving or e-volving around the craft slowly like maybe 2 to 3 miles an hour. I continue to film this object every morning if skies are clear. I have tried desperately to get help from various individuals from media members to my friend who is a priest. I have cordially invited several individuals to join me as I film but have not been succesful. I don't know whether they believe I am crazy or if they are having a hard time manipulating all the detail seen on the video? Either way, I appear to be the only one to this point to be enjoying an extra-ordinary show the rest of the world will miss unless they ! finally take a chance and come outside to look.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
We saw a triangular shaped object moving across the sky.;2008-02-27 22:30:00;~3-4 min;We saw a triangular shaped object moving across the sky. We were walking our dogs and observed a triangular-shaped, white object moving in the sky.  It resembled a wing. It was luminous.  It was moving in a straight line in a NNW direction. It moved out of our range of view (distance).  There was no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

V-shaped formation of lights moving noiselessly in night sky.;2014-03-19 22:26:00;5 minutes;V-shaped formation of lights moving noiselessly in night sky Last night (3-19-14), while sitting in our hot tub at approximately 10:26 pm, my wife was looking at the stars when she noticed a v-shaped formation of lights, which she first thought was a flock of birds.  The lights were dim orange in color and equally spaced in a v-shape.  It looked like 4 or 5 lights on each side.   I also witnessed the object.  The v-shaped object proceeded overhead in a north direction over Santa Fe.  There was no noise associated with the object.  The night was dark as moonrise had not occurred.  The object took a couple of minutes to transverse from overhead to being out of sight.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
