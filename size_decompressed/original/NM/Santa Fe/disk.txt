UFO sighted near Eldorado at Santa Fe.;2016-05-25 21:00:00;5 minutes;UFO sighted near Eldorado at Santa Fe. There was a very high wind and loud noise.  The trees were bending.  Saw an object moving parallel to the earth and about 500 feet from the ground.  It moved very slow.  Too slow for a normal aircraft to fly without stalling.  It had 2 red lights, which were located on each end of the object.  As the craft moved away from our house, the wind stopped, and it silently moved towards the horizon out of sight.  You could not hear any noise of any kind emitting from it. ((NUFORC Note:  We have amended the date above, in order to reflect a sighting in May, not June, of 2016.

((HOAX??))  Fast same elevation as a plane with many planes in the area to get a reference in appearance.  ((anonymous report));2016-06-10 23:30:00;30 seconds;fast same elevation as a plane with many planes in the area to get a reference in appearance. Went on a late walk to investigate a odd flashing light on a mountain top,  I proceeded to gaze at the sky   Where I saw a white disk shaped object 35k feet up looked to be a plane at first.  It was a solid white color.  It was flying fast through the sky then entered a cloud where it vanished for a few seconds when seconds later I see something similar exit almost the exact stop where it entered.  But this time it had two lights on each wing with a flashing red light in the center. when I noticed that was a plane and the other object finally exists the other side of the cloud.  Realizing they were both flying at about 35k ft,but the white object was much quicker and I watched it   travel across the rest of the sky untill the end of the horizon while passing several other planes, with one looking to be in pursuit but who knows at the time their was an unusual amount of air traffic.  All the planes exhibited the same features with the same two lights on each wing and re! d flashing in the middle.  It was clear at this point it was not a plane.  Too low to be a satellite or space dandruff or ice falling it flew across the sky never loosing elevation.  This most likely rules out drones flares or anything man made.  I also saw a meteor fall from the sky half hour after this and it was completely different.  I've seen alot of orbs and flying objects, since I look for them after a terrifying sighting which left me a believer yet still skeptical of just anything I rule out all possibility and do research to back up my claim.  I truly believe this is a UFO as it demonstrated speed twice that of the planes in the area. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
