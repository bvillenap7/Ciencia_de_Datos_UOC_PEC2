Was MACHINED by ME ((name deleted)) at LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL labs.  Triangle of BERYLIUM METAL.;1997-03-20 13:00:00;8 hours;Was MACHINED by ME((name deleted)) at LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL labs.  Triangle of BERYLIUM METAL. THIS IS NOT A JOKE:: THIS IS WHERE THEY ARE MADE!!!! This is what NOW DEAD ((name deleted)) STATED TO ME BEFORE HE DIED. IF I AM NOT TELLING THE TRUTH THAT GOD STRIKE ME DOWN DEAD WHERE I STAND THE TRUE GOD!! TODAY NOW!! The TRIANGLE was MADE of BERYILLIUM. I ((name deleted)) machined it at LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABS. It came in on a overhead crane as a 2000 pound plus plate of UNCUT BERYLLIUM. The scientist wanted it cut into a triangle, since I was the ONLY ONE QUALIFIED to CUT this TOXIC METAL, I WAS THE ONE WHO CUT IT.. After I was Done I called the SCIENTIST in question. He arrived in the MACHINING ROOM at the TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED MACHINING FACILITY and he didnt even want help. The TRIANGLE I had machined to EXTREME TOLERANCES that should HAVE STILL BEEN UNMOVABLE without a CRANE or OTHER MACHINERY, now was WEIGHTLESS. THE SCIENTIST pulled on it and pushed it, IT WAS LIKE A HELIUM FILLED BALLOON filled with just enough helium that if you leave it, it wont float away, it stays in PLACE, HOVERING IN THE AIR!! He took it with him this LARGE PLATE with NO HELP OF ANY KIND. The scientist KNEW IT WOULD FLOAT obviously by what ((name deleted)) SAID, so there MUST BE MANY MORE OF THEM!! THEY ARE TRIANGLES made of BERYLLIUM METAL, AND HE BECAUSE HE WAS HELD BY CONTRACT NOT TO RELEASE SIZE OR ANY OTHER DATA HE DIED WITH THE DIMENSIONS IN HIS HEAD!! He only said A COUPLE OF THOUSAND POUNDS OF BERYLLIUM IT WEIGHED WHEN THEY BROUGHT THE PLATE IN ON THE OVERHEAD CRANE. I WAS THE ONLY ONE QUALIFIED TO CUT THAT METAL!! When I was DONE IT FLOATED SO I put this for NOW DECEASED ((name deleted)) ON THE NET I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT.  I am not ((name deleted)) but that IS WHAT HE told ME so I AM JUST LETTING YOU KNOW SINCE -------YOU NEED TO KNOW!!!------- He died a FEW DAYS LATER.  IF I AM LYING MAY GOD STRIKE ME DOWN DEAD NOW SO YOU KNOW I AM NOT LYING AS TOWARDS WHAT HE TOLD ME.....  I TRIED MANY TIMES TO GET THE DIMENSIONS, HE ALLWAYS STONEWALLED ME WITH  I SIGNED DOCUMENTS that DISSALLOW ME TO DO THAT, JUST ACCEPT I TOLD YOU THIS and I TOLD YOU WAY TOO MUCH ALLREADY! Shortly later he Died, and I have been FOLLOWED by MYSTERIOUS VANS with ANTANNAE govt plates and other MYSTERIOUS VEHICLES with ELECTRONICS IN THEM GALORE!!! OSCILLOSCOPES on ! the DRIVERS SIDE OF THE CAR, and ELECTRONICS to the HILT in them..... They sported plates like 666-666gov DONT KNOW WHO THE HELL THEY ARE??;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Huge triangular object in Jemez Mountians, New Mexico;2000-06-01 21:30:00;3 minutes;Huge triangular object in Jemez Mountians, New Mexico I was camping outside Santa Fe in the Jemez mointains, not to far from Los Alamos.  I was camping with 5 other families and three of them were police officers.   Around 9:30 every night this graet big triangular shaped object would glide through the sky and would stop directly above us where it would sit for several minutes before moving away.  We saw this 3 nights in a row and all of us thought we were seing things.   The police officers said that they would lose their jobs if they told anyone that they saw it.  It never made a single sound.   Finally on the 4th night I had a really strong spot light and had it ready when the things moved over us again,  When I shined the spot light on it, it moved so fast out of the area that it seemed ot have just disapeared.   I will tell you that we got a good look at it for a fraction of a second and it is massive and a full triangle, not like a boomerang.   I have been holding this information until I saw something on the discovery channel about area 51.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Inverted tear drop shaped brightly illuminated slow moving object sighted over 3 1/2 hours.  ((NUFORC Note:  Balloon.  PD));2014-09-13 17:00:00;3 hours 45 minutes;Inverted tear drop shaped brightly illuminated slow moving object sighted over 3 1/2 hours. My wife and I first spotted the craft while on the shoulders of Mt. Picacho, observing a very bright large white object which seemed to move very slowly, almost imperceptibly.  This was at 5:00 pm in a deep blue sky it looked something like a bright planet, but much too large for that.  As we observed it repeatedly on our climb down we speculated it could possibly be someone in a large paraglider who had been able to catch an updraft to a very high altitude, but it hovered so long in a nearly motionless state that that would have been most unlikely.  Hours later, at a few minutes after 8 pm, we observed it again from our home east of the plaza in Santa Fe.  It had moved a few miles west during that time, and seemed to be directly over the central area of the city.  Our only magnification was a pair of opera glasses.  It appeared to have an inverted tear drop shape, almost like a balloon (spherical but with a small conical projection underneath), but without! a distinct basket, and was very brightly illuminated, as though internally lit with a very powerful light which seemed to have no distinct source--like a brilliant, radiant glow.  My wife states she was taken aback by its “otherworldly beauty.  A good description would have been an inverted tear drop shaped light bulb with faint horizontal bands.  Checking back on it at 8:45 pm, it had completely disappeared from the sky.  I was sorry not to have witnessed how it disappeared.  Its motion had been so slow I’d expected it to still be visible and was surprised at its sudden disappearance. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that the object was a hig-altitude, helium-filled balloon.  One was reported to have been released from Ft. Sumner in New Mexico.  http://www.topix.com/city/fort-sumner-nm/2014/09/enormous-balloon-will-carry-black-hole-hunting-telescope-aloft PD));35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Orange Ghost like wing flying overhead.;2014-10-28 22:15:00;4 seconds;Orange Ghost like wing flying overhead I saw an orange wing shaped object come and go silently last night. Around 10:15 or so. It was like a plane flying overhead, but totally silent, and kind of transparent. I couldn’t tell if it was 100 feet or 50,000 feet above me, as it was ghost like. Burnt orange, with some brighter spots, but really it happened so fast I didn’t get a great look at it’s physical construct beyond knowing it was wing shaped and orange and ghost like. Transparent and fuzzy.  It came and went in a matter of a few seconds, flying north to south. Seemed like it was gliding on a very straight path. Just an amazing occurrence. I saw this thing! But what I say not exactly sure.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
3 glowing red lights flew low over the 599 relief route near the highway I-285 junction;2016-03-16 21:40:00;1 minutes;3 glowing red lights flew low over the 599 relief route near the highway I-285 junction Three glowing red lights in a triangle shape flew low over the highway 599 relief route toward the Santa Fe Ski Area.   Stopped to hover over highway 285 and then continued moving toward the mountain.  Made no sound but at one point left a chem trail of some sort.  Smooth moving and swift but not too large - estimate around the size of a 100 foot yacht but a chevron shape.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
Triangular object with bright green lights near Santa Fe, NM.;2017-12-14 19:00:00;10 seconds;Triangular object with bright green lights near Santa Fe, NM. My husband and I were driving northeast on I-25 between Albuquerque and Santa Fe at around 7 p.m. (19:00) on Thursday, December 14, 2017.   Suddenly, at around the Waldo Canyon exit, we saw an object flying across the Interstate in a southeasterly direction.  It appeared triangular with bright green lights around its entire periphery.   From my husband's perspective, it appeared larger than a full moon.  By the time it crossed my field of vision (I was in the passenger seat), it appeared slightly smaller than a full moon.  It was perhaps several hundred feet in front and above us and appeared to be moving at about 100 mph or less.  It seemed to be heading down and then it vanished. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and we found her to be very eloquent, and very sober-minded.  We suspect that she is an excellent witness.

Fast moving triangular craft observed through a third generation night vision scope while observing the Perseids meteor shower.;2021-08-13 03:30:00;15 seconds;Fast moving triangular craft observed through a third generation night vision scope while observing the Perseids meteor shower. I am 51 years old and consider myself an amateur astronomer.  I was observing the Perseids meteor shower with my mother and father in the front yard facing a north to north east direction.  Most of the time when I am observing meteor showers, I use a 1x third generation night vision scope as I have found I can usually see triple the number of meteors compared to when I am observing naked eye. I had seen a fairly bright meteor about a minute before my sighting.  Many times, meteors come in pairs, so I was observing a specific area of the sky waiting for a second meteor.  The star Capella was observable in the upper right corner of my night scope.  From the right upper corner of field of view, I thought I sensed movement near Capella. When I focused on the spot, I could clearly see a dark object moving very fast.  As I started to track the object, I realized I was looking at a triangle.  Besides being a triangular shape, there are several things which I found unusual. 1.  There were no lights on the craft.  Even the dimmest light would have shown in the night vision. 2.  There was no sound. 3.  It must have been flying fairly low because it looked to be about the size of my thumbnail held at arm’s length or was very large flying at a high elevation.  I sensed it was flying at a lower elevation since it appeared there was a slight glow or haze to the object, maybe from light reflecting from the city lights on it. 4.  It was not an equilateral triangle.  The 2 sides were narrower than the back end.  All the sides were flat. 5.  It was a dark aircraft.  I could not sense any details other than the general shape of the craft.  Generally, if I see an aircraft through the night vision, it is light in color and much smaller compared to this object. The object was moving from north to a generally south direction.  I tracked it for about 10-15 seconds until it disappeared behind our house.  I estimate I tracked it for about 85 degrees of sky. My first thought was that maybe I was looking at a B2 Bomber.  I could see the object good enough that I could tell the back end was perfectly straight, unlike the B2.  Perhaps it was another military craft that I am not familiar with.  I don’t know if the military is allowed to fly without any running lights. I have observed many planes through the night vision.  It is very unusual to see a plane flying low enough at night that I can see its silhouette.  Usually, I just see the lights with a slight hint of an aircraft between the lights and I always hear the aircraft, especially if it is flying as low as this one appeared to be flying.   This is only the second time I have seen a plane flying without running lights.  The only other time I have seen a plane flying at night without lights was immediately after the 9-11 attacks.  While observing the object, I immediately started telling my folks what I was observing.  Neither one of them were able to see the object. I know this was a short duration sighting and maybe it was just an unknown military craft, but I thought I would throw it out there.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037
