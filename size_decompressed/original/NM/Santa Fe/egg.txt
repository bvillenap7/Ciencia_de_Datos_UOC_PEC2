I am an artist and usually watch the sky but missed this! I have also had several other sightings in the past with another person (my brother). I'll share these at another time, they were quite dramatic and I'll have to make drawings.;35.6509666666667;-105.950274537037

A large bright egg shaped object that moved slightly.;2003-09-28 18:00:00;1 hour at least;A large bright egg shaped object that moved slightly. My friends and I were stepped outside early evening on Sunday in our little courtyard off a rented adobe place approx. 3 blks from the historic plaza.  We saw a large egg shaped object (too big for a planet)about 35-40 degrees up in the eastern sky.  We stared at it and wondered what it was and it changed colors from whitish yellow to red and then back to white. It was reflecting (we think) the sun as it set. It moved a little but nothing erratic. It gradually faded.  We went out to dinner and talked to several other people who saw it.  Then we asked the local police and they laughed and said it was a weather balloon and they had alot of calls on it.  I contacted the national weather service and inquired about any possible weather ballon launchings.  I received an email back from a weather rep. and he stated that they certainly did not launch any in that area (also the object was far too large) and that he had seen it also as did hundreds of others.  Possibly miliary, NASA, private or what.....no one knows.  So, in conclusion I think it deserves to be reported. ((NUFORC Note:  We have received several reports from the CA/AZ/NM area recently of what we suspect are high-altitude helium balloons.  This may be one of those reports.
