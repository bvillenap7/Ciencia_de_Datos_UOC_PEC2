A light was situated just E of Santa Clara, NM.  I first noticed it from Vaughn, NM, I noticed a light high in the sky. ((Venus??));2014-07-11 05:00:00;1 hour;A light was situated just east of Santa Clara, NM.  I first noticed it from Vaughn, NM, I noticed a light high in the sky in the direction of Santa Clara, the light seemed stationary but would turn around in circles like a spotlight searching the area.   The light continued from that location for as long as it took to drive to Santa Clara.   It was just breaking daylight and I could tell as I neared Santa Clara that the light emitting UFO was just above and to the east of Santa Clara.   When the sky became visible blue color I could see the object was still there shining its light.   It was many thousands of feet in the air but appeared to be circular shapes, it was still in the sky when I left the area.  Too small to capture on my camera.
