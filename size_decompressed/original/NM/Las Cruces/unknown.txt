...Just a little to weird to be a star.;2003-10-22 02:45:00;ongoing;...Just a little to weird to be a star. Ok.  I've never reported here, and this seems a little wierd.  Recently I've been watching a particularly bright star, south of Orion.  The reason I noticed it was because it was moving, but only slowly and sparadically.  I was using powerlines the first few nights as a point of reference.  It seems to stay in the same place every night in reference to the stars, but it moves to noticably to be a star.  Tonight I had a few friends tell me about it, and I hadn't said a thing.  Now they are telling me that there are at least two more like it below it.  The bright one blinks from white to green to red as well.  I've noticed it for about a month or so. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that a twinkling star may have been the cause of the sighting.  PD));32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242

Saw 2 white lights fly very close to airplane then disappear by fading away.;2008-03-24 20:45:00;1 - 2 min.;Saw 2 white lights fly very close to airplane then disappear by fading away. On March 24th or 25th My wife and I were out for a walk about 8:45 PM in Las Cruces, NM.  It was a clear night with bright stars and no clouds.  I saw two lights moving from the west towards the east in the sky moving at what appeared to be a constant speed and in a straight line, about as fast as a small airplane would be going.  The two lights had just flown almost directly over the Las Cruces Airport.  The two lights were bright white color and were not flashing or blinking.  One was in front and was a little larger and brighter than the one following it.  Their alignment was straight with the path and the distance between the lights remained constant.  They remained the same brightness until right before they disappeared which I will describe later. I could not hear anything but I didn't think that was unusual.  I pointed the lights out to my wife and remarked how it might be an airplane except the lights weren't blinking and there were no red lights.  I said it seemed strange for a plane to not have flashing or blinking lights.  It crossed my mind that it could be a UFO but I still thought it was probably a plane.  She said it was a plane. We watched it and within a few seconds noticed an airplane flying west by northwest.  The second plane had flashing red lights and non flashing white lights and didn't seem unusual in any way.  The plane and the lights we saw first were heading in a way that they looked like their paths would intersect.  They looked as if they were on a collision course.  So we watched, not really excpecting them to collide, but just watching. When the plane and the lights intersected, it was hard to tell if the lights passed under or over the plane.  Their intersection appeared to happen almost directly overhead.  So far there was nothing really strange except for there being no flashing lights accompanying the two white lights.  The strange thing that happened was: immediately after the plane and lights intersected, the two white lights faded away to nothing.  the fading away was fairly fast but not instantaneous.  It seemed to take about a second for the fading to be complete.  Then the two white lights never reappeared.  There were no clouds and the airplane had just passed through the same part of the sky immedialty before yet it did not fade out of sight or even get dimmer momentarily.  The airplane was still visible and continued on it’s way. We both thought what we had just seen was very strange.  I suggested it might have been an alien spaceship but my wife dismissed that idea.  I really can’t think of a good explanation for the lights fading away like that and a few people who I described it to also thought it was weird. Neither my wife or I had been drinking or smoking anything.  I have not drank ( or smoked anything ) in over 23 years.  I am a computer scientist working for the Army at White Sands Missile Range and my wife is a Chinese immigrant.  It might be possible to check with the Las Cruces airport to see if  1 plane or 2 planes where flying over the area just to the east of the airport at around 8:45 PM on those nights.  I will try to remember exactly which night it was. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
UFO's Over Las Cruces?;2008-06-29 21:00:00;90 mins;UFO's Over Las Cruces? We have been watching these objects for some time now but this one appears to start much lower in the sky than others do.It appears as it starts to get dark & right after total dark it moves straight up from its starting point slowly taking about an hour & then after about another hour it moves to the right a considerable distance & stays at that position until morning.There are many of these objects in the sky now, numbers are increasing since we first saw them.We live in the middle of the city & have ruled out street or other lights...the objects are too high to be any street lights. We wonder why more people don't see them. They are not stars or satellites. (They move too fast & jump around) Planes seem to stay away from them.We have not been able to take any pictures of these objects, our camera will not record them.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
A very large brightly lit object floats over buildings without a sound and disappears.;2009-07-14 21:20:00;9 seconds;A very large brightly lit object floats over buildings without a sound and disappears. On 7/14/09 at 9:20 p.m. I was sitting in my easy chair watching tv when something caught my eye from the patio door to my immediate left.  The door has a full length glass pane in it with a sheer curtain over it.  I could clearly see a brightly lighted object in the sky as it was dark enough outside by then.  I could not tell the shape, but it appeared to me to be a straight wing with no fuselage, though it feasibly could have been a frisbee shape on its side with no curve, and about 8 or so bright flashing colored lights straight across it.  They were red, blue and I think white and orange and/or green.  I thought it was a jet plane about to crash. I was very startled because I don't live in a flight path so my mind was really befuddled by this time trying to make sense of what I was seeing.  The position of the object was very close and low and slowly passing just beyond a 2-story apartment building about 100 yards beyond my building in the same complex of about 10 buildings.  I did not see from which direction it came, but it could have possibly passed right over me before I saw it. I'm not sure of the altitude, maybe that of a roughly 30-story building.  To me, it appeared as though it was slowly going into a landing pattern where the wheels come down and touchdown is imminent.  If I extended my arm it would be about the length and width of my pinkie finger framed between two buildings. I jumped up and got on my slides so I could step outside to get a better look.  By the time I got out on the patio the object seemed to hesitate for a fraction of a second I thought it was trying to pull the nose up because at this point my mind still thought it was a plane, however, there was no engine noise and I assumed the engine had been cut off.  It then veered slightly to the right and disappeared behind a building. I waited for an explosion or flames and smoke shooting in the air, but nothing like that happened.  In fact, it was just gone and I heard nothing about it on the news afterwards.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
Explosion of mysterious origin.;2015-05-21 13:15:00;Instant;explosion of mysterious origin Something just blew up over the mountains by Las Cruces and fell to earth in three lines of smoke like what engines would leave behind.  No other information available.  But we have been seeing multiple orange fireballs in the sky over near Alamagordo for the last week....I have pictures on my phone but have to text them.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
Array of 6 rectangular white lights (windows or doors in the sky) flashing on and off from the center out observed for 5 seconds.;2016-05-19 01:30:00;6 seconds;Array of 6 rectangular white lights (windows or doors in the sky) flashing on and off from the center out observed for 5 seconds. At approximately 1:30 AM on May 19th, while headed eastbound on Desert Wind Way, I noticed an array of 6 rectangle lights (door like or window like in appearance) to the North east in the direction of the Jornada Testing Range.  The lights where bright white lights that flashed from the center to the outside in a horizontal fashion.  At first the lights seemed to be stadium lights out over the empty desert but after taking a second look I realized that I was looking at something much bigger.  I estimate that the lights were over 2 miles away and must have been 1 mile across in size (horizontally).   The lights flashed from the center to the left and then the center to the right and then all lights on.  The lights would flash on and off and would last about 1 second to 2 seconds in the on position.  The lights were stationary and no outline or shape was apparent when the lights were off.  Had several vehicles following and we all pulled off to the side of the road.  Two other drivers including myself saw the lights.  We looked for any signs of a craft or additional lights but saw nothing.   Approximately 15 minutes passed when we heard a rumbling sound and felt a tremor that lasted about 2 seconds.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
