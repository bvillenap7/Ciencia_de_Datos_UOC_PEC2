Unexplained column of light on I 25 in New Mexico;1977-09-26 01:00:00;15-20 minutes;Unexplained column of light on I 25 in New Mexico My late husband and I were driving from Tucson, AZ to Albuquerque, NM on I25 on September 26, 1977. We were north of Las Cruces, NM  and south of Soccoro, NM when a bright beam of light suddenly appeared over our car. We immediately assumed it was a helicopter from the US Border patrol.  We pulled to the side of the road, expecting a patrol car to come up for identifications. We turned off our motor and sat in the car for a few minutes. No vehicle of any kind appeared.  Having recently returned from two years in South Korea with the US Army, we were very aware of the sounds of flying vehicles. We then realized that we did not hear the sounds which are made by a helicopter. As it was early in the morning, there was no other traffic in either direction.  We got our of the car and looked up at the light. A bright column extended as far up as we could see and we could not determine a source or end of the light. The beam surrounded us to about three feet complete! ly around the car. Again, the most amazing aspect was absolute silence. Not even the air was disturbed so no wind. We stool there fascinated by the sight when suddenly the light simply vanished. And no sound of a flying vehicle departing. We got back in our car and continue our trip to Albuquerque. There was no unaccounted for time other than the 15-20 minutes we observed the light.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242

Two unexplainable lights over  the southern horizon near Las Cruces, New Mexico.;2008-03-28 00:05:00;10 minutes;Two unexplainable lights over  the southern horizon near Las Cruces, New Mexico. My residence is approximately five miles east of the city of Las Cruces and approximately five miles west of the Organ Mountains, half mile south of highway 70.  It is a routine for me to take my dog out to our backyard, which is on the south side of our home.  From our backyard we have a very open and clear southern view of the horizon.  This particular evening I noticed a light, approximately five to seven degrees above the horizon.  It was straight south, particular to my position.  I noticed as I looked, that it seemed rather bright and flickering like a fireball.  I immediately asked my wife to look with me.  We agreed that it was a light we had never before seen.  As we both looked, the light seemed to get larger and more intense for a couple of minutes.  Then, suddenly, it went dim as if it instantly moved further away.  At this point even I was skeptical, until the light moved to the east briefly, but noticeably and vanished.  As we stood, amazed and shocked, the light reappeared.  This time it appeared slightly more to the west than originally and a couple of degrees lower in the horizon with a slightly more reddish hue.  At this point we asked our cousin to look with us.  The light acted similar to before, getting larger and more intense.  However, it acted differently in the respect that it moved lower in the horizon before it went dim again in the same way.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
SOMETHING ON FIRE MOVING RAPIDLY AWAY SILENTLY AND DISAPPEARING;2008-08-22 20:30:00;5-8 MINUTES;SOMETHING ON FIRE MOVING RAPIDLY AWAY SILENTLY AND DISAPPEARING LAS CRUCES, NEW MEXICO AUGUST 22, 2008 APPROX. 8:30pm  MY WIFE AND I WERE ON OUR BACK PATIO FACING NORTH WHEN FIRST MY WIFE AND THEN I SAW A  FLICKERING LIGHT IN THE NORTHERN SKY. IT WAS ABOUT 30 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON AND WAS ALMOST AS BRIGHT AS THE STREET LIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM US AND APPEARED TO BE A MILE AWAY.   MY WIFE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A  BALLOON OR PLANE ON FIRE.  MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS A FLARE. IT WAS MOVING SLOWLY TO THE WEST.   ALTHOUGH IT WAS BECOMING DARK, THERE WERE A FEW STARS OUT AND WE COULD STILL DISTINGUISH BETWEEN CLOUDS IN THE NORTHER SKY AND THE SKY.  WHEN I FOUND MY BINOCULARS, THE OBJECT HAD MOVED QUITE A DISTANCE TO THE NORTH AND WAS MUCH SMALLER.  IT THEN WENT INTO THE CLOUDS, REAPPEARED MUCH SMALLER AND ULTIMATELY DISAPPEARED.  THE BASE OF THE CLOUDS WERE ABOUT 10-15 DEGREES ABOVE THE HORIZON AND PERHAPS 20 MILES NORTH OF US.  THERE WAS NO SOUND. I SHOULD NOTE THAT I AM A  FORMER AIR FORCE INTELLIGENC OFFICER AND AM A SKEPTIC ABOUT LITTLE GREEN MEN VISITING US FROM OUTER SPACE EVEN IF I DO LIVE IN NEW MEXICO (ROSWELL AND AZTEC ALLEDGED SIGHTINGS NOT WITHSTANDING). I AM STILL WAITING TO SEE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE OF ACTUAL UFO’S.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
Two seperate lights hovering and moving in circular motion.;2008-11-21 22:00:00;19 Minutes;Two seperate lights hovering and moving in circular motion. Returning home from college basketball game.  My son was driving and noticed two lights hovering east of us over the Organ Mountains.  They looked approximately 2 miles apart from each other.  The lights were flashing red and blue and would move in circles.  One stayed still while the other one moved side to side (left to right) and then made circles in a clock-wise manner at a very rapid speed.  We recorded them on our camera.  They eventually faded away.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242

I have not looked for it in the daytime but I'm sure it's there.   My first sighting and it took me four days to grasp what I'm experiencing.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
Saw a large fast moving red and yellow light that came to a complete stop and slowly faded. Then one more right after the first one.;2014-01-19 19:45:00;5 minutes;Saw a large fast moving red and yellow light that came to a complete stop and slowly faded.  Then one more right after the first one. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport, Very, very large.  Maybe a tenth the size of the moon in the sky on 1/19/14.  I never reported anything like this before so it's hard.  If you compared a basketball to a star, it was that big.  The whole thing freaked me out.   As I watched it fade out in a stationary position a second one just like it did the same exact thing as the first one.   I moved to Las Cruces ((xx--deleted)) months ago and look up at the sky everyday from my balcony.  In the last twelve hours I have seen more aircraft activity over Cruces than in the total of 7 months since I moved here.   Have you had other reports in this area for 1/19/14?  I have tried to justify this in my head as being a military operation but with all this desert around here why over the second largest city in NM?  I thought maybe a satellite launch but why two so close together? Sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242

Very bright light low in the northern sky;2017-10-16 19:40:00;5 minutes;Very bright light low in the northern sky I don't know what I saw but it didn't seem like a flying object of any kind.  I had just finished my run on Sonoma Ranch Boulevard between Lohman and Dripping Springs.  It's very dark out there in the desert and I saw a bright light to the north, just below the Big Dipper and very close to the horizon.  It had white and red light, with maybe green too.  My night vision isn't very good so I tried putting on my glasses but that seemed to make it worse.  I thought it was a planet or star and thought I would look it up when I got home.  It wasn't moving so that's why I thought it was a planet or star.  I looked down in my car for a minute because I was syncing my sports watch with the app, and then when I looked up, the light was completely gone, so obviously it wasn't a planet or star and that freaked me out a little.  I wish I knew if there were aircraft in the area, but I don't know how to look it up.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
Bright light over Organ Mountain.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of Venus??  PD));2018-11-29 04:15:00;~15 minutes;Bright light over Organ Mountain. On my way to work in the morning, I noticed a very bright white light just over the Organ Mountains.  It takes me approximately 10-15 mins to get to work and I could see it the entire way.  It never moved.  It was definitely to large to be a star or planet.  It was not the moon.  It never flickered.  I got home from work and told my husband about it and he began to describe the exact same light he saw on his way to work the previous morning also around 4:15 am.
