a hollow blue ball of lighting that turned to a fireball then took and umbrella shape and loomed for a second then disapeared.;1991-05-30 09:10:00;10-15 seconds;a hollow blue ball of lighting that turned to a fireball then took and umbrella shape and loomed for a second then disapeared. when I lived in Las Cruces NM, back in the spring of 91, I was 11 years old and had lived in New Mexico since spring of 1990 (having spent most of my life in Texas).   I was hanging out in the back yard with a friend of mine, a native american by the name of ((name deleted)) (his cousin ((second name deleted))  lived caddycorner to where me and my family lived, In a neighborhood where the stundents of the University lived).  We seen a blue light in the sky that seemed to be made of lightning or electricty at first. It appeared to be a hollow circle shape, with lines of electricity or something going from side to side across the blue outline. As it seemed to rapidly approach it turned a orangish color kind of like a fireball or something, all the sudden it was like looming over us, I like it was going to come crashing into us,  All I could do is just stand there, It happened so fast,as it approached it took an unbrella like shape made of flame above us, however I felt no heat, for a brief second I was afraid, I really couldn't believe what was happening, I stood entranced by the brillance of the colors of the flames. Then it just disapeared. I said to my friend ((name deleted)) what the @#%& was that? He replied that he had never seen anything like it. Nobody ever really believed us, shortly after I moved back to Texas, lost contact with Tim. Recently I been thinking about that event alot, I decided to look on the interent for similar experiences, and here I am. Tim if your out there, hello, it's been a long time.

Circle shaped red fire ball in Las Cruces, NM;1997-06-15 03:00:00;5 minutes;Circle shaped red fire ball in Las Cruces, NM I'm posting my report in retrospect in response to the request for sightings of red fireballs.   During the summer of 1996 or 1997, I was stargazing in Las Cruces, New Mexico and about 25 yards away from my house a red dot the size of a large star materialized from out of nowhere (in front of the Las Cruces Sun News building) and grew to approximately 8 inches in diameter.  The red plasma-like ball immediately approached me by bouncing up and down towards me in a zig zag motion.  It hovered in front of our tree, maybe 8 to 12 feet above ground, and was completely silent.   I stood up and watched it as it hovered, and yelled for my mom who was in the house (the front door was wide open).  I initially felt calm, but the more I processed the event the more I felt scared and started to panic.  As soon as my mom came outside and I ran inside the house because I was too scared to stay outside(I was a teenager at the time).   After about two minutes, I went back outside to see if it was still there and then watched it bounce away in the same way it approached our house.   It then faded away by gradually getting smaller and disappearing (it didn't fly away, it just disappeared/faded into the blackness of the night).   Although I was not college educated then, I am now, and have never seen anything like it since. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242

Orange Fireball Traveling Northbound Over Las Cruces;2009-04-20 18:35:00;10 minutes;Orange Fireball Traveling Northbound Over Las Cruces My wife and I were out exercising near our home in the northern part of Las Cruces, New Mexico.  She was jogging and I was on the bicycle.  We were on a road (Settlers Pass) heading eastbound when I saw an orange fireball in the southern sky.  At first I didn't know if what I saw was a street light or a helicopter with a spotlight in our direction or maybe a meteor.  As I slowed down the bicycle I briefly lost view of the fireball behind a house.  I wanted to make sure what I saw so as I kept rolling east I saw the object again and it was flying northbound towards our direction.  I was surprised that it did not have any blinking lights like all the other aircraft that I see fly over.  I told my wife about it, she had already finished her jog before me spotting the fireball and was walking to cool down.  She thought it was strange too.  It flew almost directly over us, just a little to our east as it kept going north.  It moved the same speed as any other aircraft that I have seen.  By the time that it was some 2 or so miles north of us, it must have sped up because the light got small really fast and eventually we could not see it anymore.  I wondered if anyone saw it.  I did not report it to the police because they probably can't do anything about it.  I don't know if this was an extraterrestial craft but if it was all I have is two eye witnesses.  With no visual proof I was not too excited to share this with too many people, but I thought I should tell someone or at least log it down for myself.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242

3 fireballs over mnts, triangle formation, random blinking on & off for 6 min.;2012-10-28 18:45:00;6 minutes;3 fireballs over mnts, triangle formation, random blinking on & off for 6 min. Seen while driving. 3 yellow-orange fireballs/lights/orbs hovering just above the southern end of the Organ Mnt range.  The sun had set 30 min or so, so it was dark out.  The lights did not move.  They formed a triangle formation. One on top, one directly below it, and one off to the right.  They would occasionally blink out, in random order, but were on more than off.  They never broke formation, never moved.  They glowed, but did not shine like a regular light, no light emmited from them, as in they did not light up the sky around them. They were positioned just above the mountains in a close enough formation for my fist held out in front of me would have covered it.  They were approx. 5 miles away from me.  They were larger than any star in the sky above but much smaller than the moon (which was large and almost full, it had just risen). I have never before seen anything like this, as in lights do not behave like this or look like this as far as I know.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242

They said it has been going for 2 minutes.  It was nearly over wal mart when the fire went out, but the object could still be seen as a darker shape in the sky. This was aprox 1,000 feet up, the flame was flat and wide, and had detail, it looked like the fire you might see from a rocket, traveling about the speed of a plane or helicopter. I would guess the thing would have been the size of a plane but a very flat plane. i would guess the fire was about 100 feet long and 50 feet wide. Deep orange and black with a dark yellow tail.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242

Bright orange fireball moving slowly and without noise from north to south;2015-11-19 19:20:00;2-3 minutes;Bright orange fireball moving slowly and without noise from north to south As I was coming home from work and turned the corner into my subdivision, I saw what I thought was a street light, that has been out for a few days, trying to start.  I noticed it was moving, however.   I stopped my vehicle, rolled down the driver-side window, and turned off the radio. The object appeared to be round, or spherical, in shape.  It didn't really have a shape, but was merely a ball of bright orange light with no distinct shape, somewhat like looking at a flare.  It seemed to be brighter in the center, more whitish.  There was no noise and the motion was in a straight line - approximately north to south.   Because the speed seemed similar to an airplane on approach to an airport, I thought maybe it was a plane with an engine fire, but, again, no noise.  Not knowing what it was or how big it was, it would be difficult to estimate its altitude, but it did not seem to be very high.  I eventually lost sight of it as some houses blocked my view.  The entire obse! rvation lasted for approximately two minutes, or so.  Having followed UFO reports for many years, this object was nothing like anything I've ever read about or seen in pictures.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242

Strange Fireballs over Las Cruces;2020-01-17 07:30:00;8:00;Strange Fireballs over Las Cruces Driving south bound down Valley  towards Las Cruces and off to the East I saw 7 fireballs just light up one by one in no particular pattern.  Once they all appeared, they were illuminated for about 5 minutes, then they fizzled out in reverse order from when they appeared.  The fireballs were not behind the Organ Mountians, they were in front of it.  From my vantage point, it looked like the fireballs were over the Massillon Valley Mall area.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
