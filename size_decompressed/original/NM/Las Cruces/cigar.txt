I was looking at the moon about 23:30 hours on October, 09, 2019 when I observed a large black shape quickly shoot past from my left to right through the lens. I was using a Twinstar F500mm scope with a 6 in mirror and a 25mm lens with a barlow attached.  The moon almost filled my whole view when all of a sudden and without any lights I could see and no noise, a black pencil shaped object swooped across the screen from left to right. Through my lens it appeared to be 1/16 of an inch thick and about 1 inch long. It happened so fast, very fast. It was alone that I could see and appeared to be slightly thicker toward the tail end. There was no noise. I continued to follow the moon for another 15 minutes with no other sightings.  It was not a bird, airplane, or any other object known to me.  It was not visible to the naked eye because I looked in the sky after I saw it.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
