bright orbs in triangular formation over NASA facility in Las Cruces, NM 7:45pm 5/17/09;2009-05-17 19:45:00;2 hours;bright orbs in triangular formation over NASA facility in Las Cruces, NM 7:45pm 5/17/09 My friend called me to tell me to check out a U.F.O. in the sky to the east at 7:45 pm.  I went outside and saw what looked like 3 large white balloons grouped together. It seemed as though it was reflecting the light from the setting sun, but as the sun set the objects got brighter, a lot brighter. I also noticed that even with the light breeze, the objects were not moving.  I soon realized these were not balloons. There were no other stars out at this point and I started getting text messages from 4 other friends telling me to check out whatever it was in the sky.  As I was in my backyard looking and describing over the phone to my friend, I could see one large orb in the center with three other orbs around it, seeming to be attached. The outer orbs were changing location, but always remained equidistant from each other (triangular formation). The object was fairly close, less than 10 miles away. I could also see a faint glow or haze around the object. My friend who called me was on the other side of town and it appeared much smaller to him than it did to me. My neighbor was outside in his backyard so I called him over and we started watching it together. As we watched, the orb flashed pinpoints of white light around it. It then began flashing pinpoints of red light around it.  After a few more minutes the center orb began to dim and the flashing pin points of light stopped, then the outer three orbs turned red and got brighter, becoming the only visible lights. At this point my neighbor’s roommate came outside with his camera and took pictures.  While I was on the phone describing what I was seeing, a small flashing light shot out of the bottom and headed northwest towards Albuquerque.  I could see a faint contrail behind the orb. This light was only visible for about 10 seconds before it was out of sight. The main object still remained in its same location but began to dim again.  Once in a while I could see a small light appear next to it, but I had to look away from the main object! to see it.  Several times I also witnessed the object to move slightly to the side or slightly upward, but always returning to its original location. Over the course of an hour, it remained it the same position in the sky, getting dimmer whereas the stars started to become visible and got brighter.  After an hour and a half it was difficult to see and was dimmer than the stars, but remained in the same place in the sky. I am sure there will be more reports, as I had 4 friends from different locations in town that all noticed it on there own and told me to check it out.  It was also nice to have my neighbor watch it with me as he was able to verify all the things I was seeing. As a side note, I found it interesting that it seemed to be directly above the NASA facility which is on the western side of the mountains from White Sands Missile Range.  I have seen other strange things in the sky before, but never have I seen something so clearly that remained in the same place for so long and have so many other witnesses.  I don’t have the pictures, but when zoomed in, it looked like 3 orbs in a triangular formation with the light stretching towards each other.  It resembled a hot air balloon but was clearly not. Another friend of mine took pictures but I haven’t seen it yet as I am writing this just after the experience.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
Several lights appeared in a line and disappeared one after another.;2010-07-04 23:00:00;6 minutes;Several lights appeared in a line and disappeared one after another. It was the 4th of July. We had just got done grilling out and blowing fireworks.  As we were cleaning up, our uncle came over and said, “Look over there! What’s that?”  Seven of my family member’s all witnessed what appeared to be UFO‘s.  These UFO’s were in a single formation. We counted approximately seven of them and viewed them for about five minutes.  They had no blinking lights, they were Orange, and were circular.  What we found odd was that they were all traveling in an equal distance apart and would just disappear.  Four days later my uncle heard on the radio that these strange lights were seen across the U.S. What could these be?;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
