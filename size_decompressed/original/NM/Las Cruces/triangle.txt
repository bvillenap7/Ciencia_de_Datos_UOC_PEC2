There was a lighted dome in the center. The craft was moving slowly from SE to NNW at about 5,000 feet. Over the Franklin Mountains, this area is just east of Ft. Bliss and slightly southwest of White Sands Missle Range. I have a background in science, masters degree, and work at one of the military installations, I am familiar with many types of aircraft. This was very different. From observing the crafts speed, size, etc. I would say it traveling just slightly faster than stall speed, the craft was more or less 300 feet lateral and 100 feet front to back. Both of us are trained scientists working in our disiplines, there is no question about what we observed. ((NUFORC Note:  We have received several similar reports from this area in the recent past.  We wonder whether the object may be a high-altitude, helium-filled research balloon.  PD));32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
09/30/06 Las Cruces NM Triangle spoted under the Pleiades for 30 min;2006-09-30 23:00:00;about an hour;09/30/06 Las Cruces NM Triangle spoted under the Pleiades for 30 min I am not an astronomer by any means, but I do know a few of the constellations and enjoy looking at them on clear evenings.   As I was sitting in my hot tub last night the sky was extremely clear.  I looked up at Pleiades and then straight down to the Belt of Orion.  What I saw right between the two was a giant triangle consisting of what looked like 5 stars.  The thing was about 2/3 the size of the dipper [not counting the handle].  In all the years I have been looking at the stars I do not remember ever seeing a triangle in this area of the sky.  I have even taken college level astronomy and no mention was ever made about this.   I can running back in the house and looked up the sky charts in the Night Watch book by Terence Dickinson.  No triangle is suppossed to be there.  There are 3 star triangles in other areas of the sky but no 5 star triangle under the Pleiades.  What made it even stranger is that as the earth rotated, the triangle did not match the speed and location of the other stars.  Sometimes it looked to be out in front of the Pleiades, and sometimes in line with it.  Then again sometimes it appeared to be moving straight and other times tilted upwards.   The sky was very clear and maybe this thing is supposed to be there but it is a first for me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.

Triangular UFO with tentacles.;2007-03-25 15:10:00;20 minutes;Triangular UFO with tentacles. Sunday, March 25 The evening was calm, warm, and cloudless. I was in my front yard talking to my best friend. At around 7:10 pm, I looked up to the sky and saw a strange triangular object in the sky. We looked at it for a while to see if it would move, but it appeared to stay still almost floating in the sky for at least 5 minutes. We thought it was strange because it was really close to the moon. 	I called out to my mom to come see the object because I thought she would know what it was. My mom didn’t know what it was, so she got the binoculars so we could see it up close. Then, it appeared to move. But not like an airplane, it was slower but yet even slower than a helicopter. 	By the time my dad came outside to see it, it was moving, at about the speed of a helicopter, towards us. Then an airplane passed by it, but from my point of view, it looked as if it went right under it. I looked at it through the binoculars I saw a triangular shape with rounded corners. The triangular part was black but not shiny. It almost looked like black plastic. It also had a translucent stripe through the middle. When it got closer you could see some tentacle-looking claws from the left and right sides. They were silver but shiny, as if made from metal. Then we noticed it moving southeast towards the mountains. But then I started speeding up and going up towards the sky. Soon we couldn’t see it as well because it sped up and was going in random directions. Then we just saw it disappear into the sky. The whole ordeal lasted about 20 minutes. That night I got on the internet to look for triangular UFOs but I only found one that has lights in the corners and a beam in the middle. Maybe it wasn’t a UFO I saw but I definitely don’t think it was an airplane or helicopter because of the shape. But I really think that if anyone sees a UFO that they think looks like mine should take a picture an report it as another type of UFO.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
