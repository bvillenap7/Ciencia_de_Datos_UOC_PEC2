Black disc with greenish/bluish/white corona traveled parallel with I10 between Las Cruces and El Paso.;1999-04-07 03:20:00;less than a minute;Black disc with greenish/bluish/white corona traveled parallel with I10 between Las Cruces and El Paso. Heading south along I10 towards El Paso, an enormous, black, disc-shaped object flew parallel with I10 at a high rate of speed, heading south/southeast on the right side of the highway between Las Cruces and El Paso. It had a brilliant corona effect with white closest to the disc-shaped field of black and then bleeding out into light green and blue pastels.  Underlit by the reddish haze that seems to hang over El Paso, it looked like a round rainbow with a pitch black center as it remained heading south.  In my mind it was momentarily accepted as a meterorite, until it veered sharply back on it's path heading east/northeast and appeared to go into an almost oval shape as it shot past directly back over the city of Las Cruces.  It should have been visible to anyone traveling on I10 south that morning.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242

I saw a strange oval lighted object in the sky when I was flying from Austin to San Diego.;2018-08-22 21:45:00;60 seconds;I saw a strange oval lighted object in the sky when I was flying from Austin to San Diego. On August 22nd, I took a flight from Austin to San Diego and we were on Las Cruces, New Mexico, the pilot told us to put on our seat belt because we are going to hit bad weather.   So, I took out my phone to take some pictures of the storm.  When I looked out the window I noticed a bright light in distance so I took a picture of it.  Then I notice it was moving weird.   So I started filming it and then it disappeared and we never hit bad weather.  I think the pilot saw what I saw that's why he told us to buckle up.   After the flight, I asked to talk to the pilot and they got him for me.  I showed him my pictures and video and ask him this is what I saw when he told us to buckle up.  His reply this is Venus then I said Venus just doesn't disappear.  Then the pilot replied sometimes you see strange things in the sky.   I was on Southwest flight 1728 on 8/22/18.   Have have pictures and video of this incident.  I posted this incident on my Instagram account @((address deleted)).;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
Yellow orange, large, oval lights faded in and out over about three minutes.;2019-08-12 22:30:00;3 minutes;Yellow orange, large, oval lights faded in and out over about three minutes. One very bright, large, oval, orange yellow light faded in and stayed for about 10 seconds then faded out.   About 2 minutes later, three faded in in consecutive order, then faded out consecutively in about ten seconds in a vaguely triangular formation.  They were in the Southwest sky. Observers are not really into UFOs and were just sitting outside chatting.   One is a retired tattoo artist the other is a repossession specialist.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
