Large white cylinder UFO around passenger jet;2009-05-16 10:15:00;8 minutes;Large white cylinder UFO around passenger jet I was sitting on the deck in the morning when I noticed a jet with contrails. Then I noticed another object with no contrail very close to the jet which was about 3 times the size of the jet or more. As they moved to the west, the larger cylinder shaped object moved way ahead of the jet until my husband and I lost track of both. We got the binoculars out and were able to see the cylinder shaped UFO very clearly. It was long and skinny and white colored. It had something in the middle of it, like spokes sticking out or something sticking out. The UFO started out on the other side of the jet going at first the same speed as the jet but then it went a lot faster and kept putting more distance between it and the jet. The UFO disappeared while we could still see the jet and contrails in the distance. We were astounded and excited when we saw it and, of course, very curious. The UFO was too far away and moving too quickly and getting even further away to take any pictures or a video. I wish we could have because it was so clear through the binoculars, it was not blurry in any way. The day was perfectly clear, no clouds but there were winds. Seen 10:15 am on May 16, Saturday, for about 8 minutes.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
