Driving west on I-10 through NewMexico 2 friends and I watched a VERY HUGE black frisbee shaped object hovering in one place for about 2 hours. I estimated the object to be about twice as big as Tampa Stadium. We pulled over and got out to see if we could tell if it was moving,because we were doing 85 across the desert and it was hard to judge it while we were moving.  We stood there for about a half hour looking,pointing and basically freaking out on the fact that we were seeing something that was very obviously way too huge to be man-made. It was a couple thousand feet up in the air and a few miles from us to the south. We saw other cars pull over and other people were standing on the roadside watching it to. We got back on the road and we watched it until dark. We first saw it between 4pm & 5pm. We basically drove INTO and OUT OF sight of the object. We watched it for THAT LONG!!!! While we were getting further into dusk, almost dark, we saw tiny lights in random patterns begin to blink. The lights were not bright at all, but they were visible after it was dark. I was on my way to a trade show in L.A.,coming from florida. The date was tuesday,Jan.27th 1998. I am giving this report on monday,Aug.17th 1998,because I have looked in all of the UFO sighting report sites on the net and I have not found one single report of this event that I and at least 8 other people witnessed. We even saw a plane flying in the area. Are there any other people who saw this too????????;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
Disk shaped object and other less distinct object was photographed over Las Cruces, NM.  10-05-02 @4:49 pm.;2002-10-05 16:49:00;unknown;Disk shaped object and other less distinct object was photographed over Las Cruces, NM.  10-05-02 @4:49 pm. I took 4 pictures of the mountains to the west of Las Cruces, NM.  The camera was a Canon G2 digital.  The last shot taken at 4:49 pm was enlarged after downloading to  a computer.  Only then were the images of 2 objects noticed in the sky.  One in the upper left was disk-shaped and appeared metallic in luster.  A second object, below and to the right of the first, was apparently much smaller and/or further away.  A previous shot taken 2 minutes earlier showed no objects.

White disk hover over New Mexico;2006-06-02 04:00:00;15 minutes;White disk hover over New Mexico Was driving through New Mexico on the way to Phoenix. Stopped at one of the only gas stations for hundreds of miles and saw a large white disk or saucer hover in the sky. This object was fairly close, maybe a couple hundred feet high. It just hovered and didn't move. It wasn't attached to anything and it definately wasn't a balloon. About 5 people at the gas station was looking up at it, but no one was talking about it. I drove about 10 miles up the road and I could still see it hover in the same spot. New mexico is very empty, no trees, so you can see for miles. I regret not having a camera.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242

Bright white disk shaped object travelled along side of our vehicle for about 30 minutes.;2016-08-08 10:30:00;30 minutes;Bright white disk shaped object travelled along side of our vehicle for about 30 minutes. While driving this morning, west, between Las Cruces and Deming, New Mexic, I noticed a bright circular disk shaped object to the south, perhaps 10 miles away and just above the mountains. It was bright and very distinct.  As we proceeded my wife and I continued to try and guess what it might be.  What made me think it was  a UFO was the fact that it stayed along side of our vehicle, which was traveling at 75 mph for about 30 minutes, at the same distance and altitude as when first noticed.  I thought this was too slow to be an aircraft and too consistent in speed to be a weather ballon, cloud, or anything else.  At the end of the 30 minutes the object started to move at an incline in a southerly direction toward Mexico and disappeared. Photos taken with the iPhone while moving show a football shaped object that does not look as solid as it appeared to the eye.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
