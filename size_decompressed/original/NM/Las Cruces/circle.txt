Half way to las cruses, (which is about a 30 min. drive) we spotted a shining light about 1000 feet in the sky, coming over us.  As we watched the light, the light grew from 1 light, to 2 lights, and then into 4 lights.  The crafts were moving silently over the mountains. finally about 3 minutes later, the lights went over the mountains,and we could no longer see them any longer. The lights looked as though there were 2 on top, and 2 on bottom.  The two on top were close together, and the 2 on bottom were further apart, almost like a small pyramid.  The lights were very bright. my father and i were driving home from el paso, texas, to las cruses new mexico.  half way to las cruses,(which is about a 30 min. drive) we spotted a shining light about 1000 feet in the sky, coming over us.

The lights that we saw, were round.  they were very bright, almost like extra bright spotlights. The color of the lights was a yellow or shining color.  the background of my father,(the other witness besides me)is that he is an ex-soldier in the army.  he doesn't believe thy were ufo's, but rather some kind of secret millitary aircraft. my father is the type that believes everything the government says. my own background is, i'm 15, what other information do you need to know?;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
On April 23, 2009 I saw three objects with bright lights that follow our vechicle on the freeway.;2009-05-24 02:15:00;15 min;On April 23, 2009 I saw three objects with bright lights that follow our vechicle on the freeway. In the early hours Of May 24, 2009, at approximately 2:15 AM, my husband and I were driving I -25 southbound.   We noticed two far away lights way in the distance. The lights look like part of a radio tower.  As we approached the lights we then saw three circle shaped bright lights. Our truck reached the lights and we saw that it was not a tower. Puzzled we continued our drive home. Surprisingly, the lights suddenly proceeded to follow to our vehicle. All three objects followed us at eye level on the passenger side of the window.  They followed us on the opposite side of the freeway.  All three lights kept pace with us, my husband accelerated to the speed of 80 mph. At one point, in a split second all three hovered above our truck. They continued to do for the next three miles. My husband slowed and stopped, pulling off the road at one point.  He was going to see what was above us. I was very frighten and asked him not to go outside, the lights hovered above us waiting .We started the truck again and got on the freeway the bright objects keeping up as their lights flashed off and on. As we approached the city of Las Cruces the lights fell back and disappeared as we got close to the city limits.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
Glowing orb like object. Very bright yellow and red. Low western sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Jupiter and Venus?  PD));2012-02-22 21:20:00;20 min approx;Glowing orb like object. Very bright yellow and red. Low western sky. I watched it for about 10 minutes.  Due west low on the sky.  Looked like a plasma ball through the telescope but then again my telescope isn't very good.  It got lower and lower very slowly, then just went out(saw it with my own eyes)  It was glowing red and yellow pulsating very brightly!   Very interesting.  Wondering if anyone else saw it or knows what it was.  There is a comet that is supposed to be visible this month, but I'm almost positive that was not it ( no tail, and it moved very very slow)  Brightness was about 4 bright stars combined at its brightest.Â  ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Jupiter and Venus?

Slowly flashing lights above Las Cruces.;2017-08-24 21:20:00;9 minutes;Slowly flashing lights above Las Cruces This was the same as a few years back, different location.   Multiple lights, yellowish/white slowly flashing on and off, then disappearing, then reappearing.  Lights were in a slightly curved line.   This time it must have been something because there was a jet, probably from Alamogordo, that flew around where the lights were.   I was looking to the N/E from Mesilla towards Elks Dr.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
