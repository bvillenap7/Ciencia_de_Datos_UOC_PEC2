Green swoosh/check-mark gliding over NMSU;2012-04-15 22:00:00;20 seconds;Green swoosh/check-mark gliding over NMSU I lived on the 2nd floor of my apartment complex, and as I was outside walking to my door, off in the distance, there was a Nike brand looking swoosh in the sky over New Mexico State University.  It flew very quickly for about 20 seconds across the top of the campus (high in the sky).  It was a very brightly colored Blue in the front, with a bright turquoise tail.  It flew behind a group of trees, and that was the last I have seen of it.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242

5 orange glowing orbs forming triangles and lines.;2013-12-31 23:50:00;20 minutes;5 orange glowing orbs forming triangles and   lines 	At approximately 2350 on December 31, 201,3 we were up on a roof waiting for fireworks.  We saw an orange orb seem to shoot upward from the west ending up in Northwest Direction (Las Cruces,NM). 	This orb hovered,seemed to come closer,then backed away and  moved slowly left to right.  Shortly after, we saw a second one and they were in close proximity to each other,moving in different directions. 	After midnight 3 more appeared,slowly hovering around each other. At one point all 5 aligned forming a    straight slanted line.  My daughter felt it looked as one big craft,with lights at its edge at this point.  They all slowly dimmed out, except one.  (During the course of this entire experience,they would dim to the size of a small orange star, less bright-but mainly stayed larger & glowing orange). 	About 3 minutes later, the only orb left stopped moving, about 5 seconds later,two orbs appeared below it,forming an acute triangle,it hovered for about 15 seconds.  The other 2 orbs were hovering off to the triangles left. 	THEN the orb on the top of the  triangle moved upward to its right aligning itself with the bottom right orb.  The bottom left orb started moving further to its left forming a right triangle.  It stayed this way for about 5 seconds, then we looked away to get down from the roof (as other child became very concerned and upset).  We looked up again and they(all 5) were still hovering slowly around in no particular order.  They remained a very bright glowing orange.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242

3 multicolored craft observer traveling in sky and turned off lights as commercial airplane traveled past in same general area.;2016-10-07 00:05:00;15-20 min.;3 multicolored craft observer traveling in sky and turned off lights as commercial airplane traveled past in same general area Tight cluster of multi blinking colored lights (white, blue, green, red).  Observed through binoculars. clusters appeared to be 1 craft.  At first 2 clusters which moved slowly around and next to each other minutes.  Occasionally lights would go out completely as in when an obvious airplane closed in on their position but at a different level.  Plane was not interacting with craft and kept on its flight pattern apparently unaware or unconcerned of blinking lights.  When plane was (I assume) far enough away, the lights on craft came on again and from one of the clusters emerged another seemingly smaller craft with only white light which moved very quickly away from the main cluster.  The two clusters (crafts) were getting smaller.  Apparently moving away from me closely followed by the smaller white light craft till they were out of rang of my binoculars.  This whole incident took about 15 to 20 minutes.  I had my wife occasionally take a look at what was going on.  No noise.   I have observed these same type of craft in different parts of the sky many times.   I didn't know there was this place to report it and didn't really think about doing it till today.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
