Later on 4 stationary objects in the sky, all the same. Me and 4 others were driving home when I looked up and saw 5 amber lights all stationary, however the lights were flickering nonstop.  This went on for about a minute.   Shortly after, there was a very loud, obnoxious booming noise that we can't explain.  For the rest of the night we have been seeing several objects in the sky that have a red light, and a white light that have been in the sky for several hours now, however they are not moving.   Once we've been home, our dogs have been barking like crazy and refuse to go outside.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
Red light formation.;2019-09-26 21:00:00;15 seconds;Red light formation. I was walking my dogs when I saw 3 red lights in the air. I thought they were flares at first but they started to line up together.  The lights started getting brighter then dimmed then disappeared.  It happened quicky maybe in less than a minute.  I was going to take a picture because I was on the phone but I thought it was flares or an airplane but I've never seen an airplane with 3 red lights moving to be in a single line, flashing brightly together then disappearing together.  By the time I was ready to take a picture or video, it had disappeared. I will continue to watch for it.;32.3524557077626;-106.75260913242
