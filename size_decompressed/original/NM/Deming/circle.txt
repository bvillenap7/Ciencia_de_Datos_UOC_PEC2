The object looked to be about 3 miles up in the sky.  I noticed no sound, the object looked like a chrome Bering (sic.  bearing), about the size of a house, from what my eyes could see.  There were no lights visible.   As we left the truck stop, due west, we noticed five black hawks ((helicopters)) heading towards the object. ((NUFORC Note:  We have contacted the nearby scientific balloon launch facility, and they have no balloons released, at the time and date of the sighting.
