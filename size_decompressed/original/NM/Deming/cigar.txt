SAW LARGE GRAY CIGAR SHAPED OBJECT HOVERING OVER DESERT AREA SOUTH OF I 10.NOT A BLIMP NO LIGHTS NO CABLES NO MOTORS TO LARGE TO BE ANY;1992-11-22 00:00:00;KEPT DRIVING;SAW LARGE GRAY CIGAR SHAPED OBJECT HOVERING OVER DESERT AREA SOUTH OF I 10.NOT A BLIMP NO LIGHTS NO CABLES NO MOTORS TO LARGE TO BE ANYTHING OTHER THEN UFO, APPROXIMATE SIZE OF A BATTLESHIP. OR AIRCRAFT CARRIER. I SOLD MY HOME IN SAN DIEGO CALIF.NOV 22 1992 PACKED MY PICKUP TRUCK LOADED WITH MY BELONGINGS AND HEADED FOR MY NEW HOME IN PANAMA CITY FLA. THAT NIGHT ON INTERSTATE 10 NOT FAR MAYBE 10 MILES FROM RT 11 WITH THE NEAREST TOWN BEING DEMING NEW MEXICO ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY THE SOUTH SIDE LOOKING TOWARDS OLD MEXICO AT ABOUT 1/2 HOUR BEFORE DARK THERE WAS A HUGE GRAY CIGAR SHAPED OBJECT HOVERING ABOVE THE GROUND. THE DISTANCE AWAY AND HEIGHT ABOVE GROUND IS UNKNOWN TO ME,BUT AN EDGUCATED GUESS IS ABOUT 1 MILE AWAY AND MAYBE THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE GROUND. MY MEMORY HAS DULLED IN 8 YEARS.I HAD MY CAT WITH ME AND ALL MY POSSESSIONS,AND DIDNOT WANT TO PARK MY VEHICLE AND GO WANDERING OUT IN THE DESERT TO INVESTIGATE. I AM A COMMERCIAL PILOT( UNEMPLOYED AT PRESENT) AND KNOW ABOUT AIRCRAFT AND AIRSHIPS. THIS WAS NOT A BLIMP. THERE WAS NO GONDOLA NO ENGINES NO TETHERING WIRES AND APPEARED TO BE ONE SOLID LIGHT GUN METAL GRAY OBJECT. AS LARGE AS A BATTLESHIP, OR AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER. THERE WAS NO BLINKING LIGHTS OR MARKINGS. I KNOW AND HAVE BEEN AROUND SOME OF THE BIGGEST BLIMPS IN AMERICA, AND THIS WAS NOT BUILT LIKE ANY OF THEM AND WAS MANY TIMES BIGGER THEN ANY OF THEM. I JUST SLOWED DOWN MAYBE I STOPPED FOR A FEW SECONDS, DON'T REMEMBER NOW. BUT I WROTE THE EXACT CO-OORDENANCES IN MY ROAD ATLAS AND HAVE THIS HIDDEN SOMEWHERE. I HAVE TOLD PEOPLE ABOUT THIS AND WAS LOOKED AT AND LAUGHED AT LIKE I WAS A NUT. JUST RECENTLY I DISCOVERED THIS FORUM AND THE ART BELL FORUM. I REALLY WISHED I HAD STOPPED AND TOOK MY CHANCES NOW. I PROBABLY NEVER WILL KNOW FOR SURE NOW. IN THE IMPERIAL VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A TETHERED RADAR BALLOON TO SPOT DRUG SMUGGLERS,I HAVE FLOWN MY AIRPLANE AROUND THIS AREA SEVERAL TIMES AND IT IS PUNY COMPARED TO WHAT I SAW AND NO WAY NEAR TO WHAT THIS THING WAS.;32.2333;-107.7453
Large stationary object for over an hour;2019-12-22 07:00:00;1 hour or more;Large stationary object for over an hour I was driving eastbound on I-10 in New Mexico.   the sun was rising I noticed a large black spot in the southeastern sky.  It's shape was somewhat round but seemed kind of like a blob.  The object did not change position at all for the next hour or so other than where I saw it in my windshield and then passenger window.  This object was far away and seemed to  be quite large.;32.2333;-107.7453
