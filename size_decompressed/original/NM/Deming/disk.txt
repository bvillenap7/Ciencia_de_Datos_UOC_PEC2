Orange glowing disk  south west of Deming NM  on night of 11/04/03;2003-11-04 20:50:00;15 sec.;Orange glowing disk  south west of Deming NM  on night of 11/04/03 At approx. 8:50 pm Mountain time and about 8 miles SW of Deming NM I went outdoors to run an errand and noticed what seemed to be an unusual bright star like object above Red Mountain, a large formation rising from the desert floor a few miles west of us. By the time I ran inside, got the binoculars and came back out that object was gone. Still, it had looked unusual so I decided to stay outside for a bit and continue looking. There were several conventional aircraft in the sky and it was calm and clear. It is dark out here in the desert away from town and to the west there are few lights- it is mostly ranch land. I didn't see anything else and was getting ready to go back to the house, but all of a sudden there was a bright flash in the sky to the northwest but nothing more, then a few seconds later a very bright orange light appeared about a hand span above the western horizon- I still had the binoculars and took a look at it. It was a large glowing orange disk. It was glowing like a burning ember in a wood stove or fire place. It was moving fairly rapidly and it seemed to wobble a bit- sort of rocking back and forth. It was moving south and then it seemed to go to the west away from me. It had no discernable features except it color and shape. When it looked like the object was heading west I ran to get my husband who was working at the computer- I wanted a second witness to this sighting. By the time he got to where I had been standing all that he could see with the binoculars was a glowing orange spot that eventually dissappeared. From my vantage point this sighting was over very flat open country just south of Red Mountain. The object could have been 10 miles away. What is interesting is that it may have been moving in the direction of I-10 so others may have seen something in SW NM or SE AZ as this object was big and bright. I think I watched it about 15 seconds and it was probably visible for about 60 seconds. We stayed outside for awhile longer but saw nothing else unusual.;32.2333;-107.7453
