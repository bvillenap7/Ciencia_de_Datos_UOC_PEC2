Orbs over Deming, NM, nightly!!;2014-06-22 21:30:00;all week;Orbs over Deming, NM, nightly!! Every night , beginning at dark,spherical objects appear, flying south and north, sometimes in pairs.  Some flash brightly....and vanish, others drift along correcting course, all vanish over the Floridas mountains.   Ive seen shooting stars come down in front of them, they simply change course, ive seen them fly directly over aircraft.  In one night i counted 22 traveling back and forth from north to south,  Ive showed them to many people and they never fail to appear we cant stop looking up now, ((what)) are they.;32.2333;-107.7453
