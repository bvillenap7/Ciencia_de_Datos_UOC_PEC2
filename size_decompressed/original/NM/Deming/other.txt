Silent, jet-shaped, beige hovering object viewed. Magnetic interference with watches.;1996-10-09 15:30:00;30 seconds;Silent, jet-shaped, beige hovering object viewed. Magnetic interference with watches. While driving SW on I-25 between Albuquerque and Deming, off the highway (west side) a large jet-type vehicle (bigger than a 747) was observed to hover SILENTLY off the ground for about 30 seconds.  It was identifiable by shape only.  The color was completely beige.  No windows, doors, or lights were seen.  It lifted straight up, off the ground, like it was on a trampoline, but then hovered for those few seconds, then again completely silent, dropped back down.  It disappeared from view.  The observers were myself and my husband:  1) computer specialist and 2) Registered Nurse.  There was one other vehicle behind us.  A white Chevy pick up truck, which did not stop. Our photos of the object were mysteriously blank.  Our watches stopped at some point during the viewing (around 1530).;32.2333;-107.7453

Black stationary object seen south of I-10 in New Mexico at dusk;2003-12-04 16:30:00;30-45 minutes;Black stationary object seen south of I-10 in New Mexico at dusk I was driving west on I-10 about 10 miles east of Deming, New Mexico when I saw a black object ahead and to the south of me.  Thought it looked like a Chinook helicopter but after a while I noticed it was not moving.  I was getting closer to it.  Stopped in Deming to talk with my salesman who was in his car behind me.  Asked him what the black object that was not moving was and he said he did not know.  Had no binochulars to look at it with so we continued west on I-10.  Observed for another 10 miles or so when it became to dark to see it any longer, since I was looking over my shoulder to the east.  Object seemed large, around 500-1000 feet across and up & down.  Had no shape to it, just looked like a blob.  I would estimate altitude between 5000-10000 feet.  It was probobly about 5-20 miles south of interstate.  It did go behind a mountain as was driving west but reimerged once I got past mountain, object never moved.  Object size and altitude are just guesses since there was nothing to compare it to. (NUFORC Note:  We presume the witness intended a date in the year 2003, and we have changed the date above accordingly.  We believe the error arises from a glitch in our Online Report Form.

I observed a hovering object along N.M. highway 11 south of Deming N.M. at 10:40 am for 15 minutes as I drove north.;2009-03-20 10:40:00;15 minutes;I observed a hovering object along N.M. highway 11 south of Deming N.M. at 10:40 am for 15 minutes as I drove north. This sighting occurred while driving north on N.M. highway 11 between Columbus, N.M. and Deming N.M. near the Mexico/USA border.  I left the border town of Palomas, Mexico at 10:32 and had traveled approximately ten miles north on New Mexico highway 11, within a couple of minutes after passing thru a permanent Border Patrol check point I noticed an object in the sky to the north west of my traveling vehicle, at first glance I thought it was a commercial aircraft, after two or three minutes I became aware it was not moving.  I estimate the object was over 1000 ft. above the ground.  The object resembled a tube that was larger on both ends similar to having a 747 bulging cockpit on both ends size large but size relative to a 747 is unknown and I could not identify any wings, white on top shaded on the bottom and I observed the object for 15 minutes while I traveled. After about six minutes total time it was directly to my left and still not moving. I estimate its distance from the road to be four miles plus or minus one mile. As I continued moving I kept looking back, the object remained where I had originally seen it but it became harder to find as I was driving. when I was about eleven miles from Deming New Mexico I could no longer identify it. It may have moved or it was just to difficult to see in the scattered cloudy sky while driving at 60 mph. Please don't criticize my looking behind while driving, there was only scattered traffic and at least I never use a cell phone while driving. The strange part of this is the object did not move, it hovered or at least from a moving car it appeared to hover in one location throughout the entire time. I have an engineering degree and I firmly do not believe in alien aircraft. There were other vehicles on the highway that should have seen the object, the border patrol agents at the checkpoint may have seen the object although it would have been behind them as they faced the traffic they would be checking. What I saw is unidentified, at least by myself, Einstein's theories seem to preclude the possibilities of space travel and until somebody, as advance in their thinking as Einstein comes up with a better theory I will continue to not believe in space travel, but I saw what I saw.;32.2333;-107.7453
Orange glowing orb west of Deming, New Mexico.;2013-09-19 22:00:00;3 minutes;Orange glowing orb west of Deming, New Mexico. As I looked at the mountains west of Deming I saw a huge orange orb that was suspended in the air at a height about halfway up the mountain.  The orb glowed like a full moon with shadow patterning much like the craters on the moon.  The orb was perfectly still and silent and  was over an area called Rockhound Park.   I went into the house and when I came back out it was gone.;32.2333;-107.7453
I saw and photographed an object hovering about 1000 feet in the air for about an hour.  ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites?  PD));2019-12-22 16:00:00;1 hour;I saw and photographed an object hovering about 1000 feet in the air for about an hour. I was driving through Deming NM and about 30 miles prior I saw a hovering object out to the south of Deming. I couldn't figure out if it was a blimp or a weather balloon but it was stationary. As I got to Deming it was in the same area but it did appear to have moved a little bit further south. I took pictures of it with my phone and it appeared roundish from that view. I went into the store...came out and it was still there. As I drove West on I-10 I got a different and better view of it. It wasnt round. I stopped on the side of the road and took more pictures. It was either white or Silver and it looked like it had 2 areas on it. Not round. There were no wings or propellers and it just sat there moving a bit back and forth but nothing drastic. It just propelled there. I don't believe it was a drone. What could stay up there that long? It had to be at least 1000 feet in the air and it wasnt small. At least the size of a commercial plane.;32.2333;-107.7453
UFO sighting I 10 through New Mexico 32.2361000, -108.0330000.;2020-09-03 19:30:00;30 minutes;UFO sighting I 10 through New Mexico 32.2361000, -108.0330000. Driving through Deming New Mexico my girlfriend noticed something stationary in the sky. She asked me to look. I pulled over to the side of the road. All I could make out was something white in the sky. After looking for what I guess was about 30 seconds the object rotated. The rotation was slow and turned from left to right. About midway through the turn the sun reflected off of it. I could tell it was oddly shaped for an aircraft looking square and oblong. After turning lengthways facing what I think was south, it started moving south. The movement seemed slow at first then moved out of site. After returning to my truck we were wondering why no one else was seeing this and stopping. After driving off, it reappeared. I stopped again looking out the window. It did this exact same maneuver I think three times over a period of about 30 minutes. Then didnt reappear. My girlfriend and myself didnt know what to make of what we had just seen. Excited and amazed at first. It just seemed so surreal. The following day after telling a couple friends, the reality set in for me and almost had a panic attack. I took a xanax I had and it calmed me down. I know this for sure, I'm not talking about this anymore. I know I'll never be the same, and scared to look towards the sky.;32.2333;-107.7453
