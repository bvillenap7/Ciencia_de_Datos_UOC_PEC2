UFO in Deming NM 11/25/18;2018-11-25 17:17:00;20 minutes;UFO in Deming NM 11/25/18 While driving on HWY 26, moving South West into Deming, I saw this object (no lights and appeared grey) for over 20 miles.  I was driving 70 mph.  It didn't get farther away, nor did it seem to get any closer.   The sun was going down fast so when I turned into Deming I took a picture of it.  Soon it got too dark to see anything.;32.2333;-107.7453
