Triangle-shaped craft hovers silently over the Pecos River.;1992-05-10 09:45:00;5 seconds;Triangle-shaped craft hovers silently over the Pecos River. On a cloudless Sunday morning around 9:45, I was riding my bicycle to one of Carlsbad’s city parks on the Pecos River.  I had stopped briefly to check for traffic before I crossed a street that was a few blocks from the river.   As I was starting to cross the road, I became aware of a large triangular craft hovering silently just above the trees on the river bank.  The craft was a dull dark gray or black, about 50’ long and maybe 25-30’ wide.  I could not judge its width as well because of the flat angle at which I was viewing it, but I could clearly see that it had a triangular shape and a fairly thin profile.  After a few seconds, it faded out, as if it had dissolved into the air. At the time of the sighting, I was working in Carlsbad as a mental health professional.  I previously had been chief of a large fire protection district in the western U.S., and had training in fire investigation.   Before that I was a naturalist with the National Park Service, and have long been a student and observer of nature.  I consider myself to be a curious, careful and scientifically oriented observer.
