We saw two very fast-moving objects take off.;2000-12-09 18:00:00;45 seconds;We saw two very fast-moving objects take off. I was walking up my front sidewalk when I looked towards the east at the moon.  I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be 4 stars lined up in a straight row above the moon.  I waited for my husband to put down what he was carrying to tell him to look at the stars. Just as I pointed them out to him, the two stars to the south suddenly started moving!  They accelerated very rapidly and disappeared within just a couple of seconds.  They did not fade out or anything, they just started moving and then disappeared.  My husband and I both saw it very clearly. They were moving way too fast to be any kind of aircraft I know of. There was no sound at all.;32.4116;-104.2427
Strange light moving by moon.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space Station flew over Carlsbad, NM, at 2022-2026 hrs. on this date.  PD));2006-05-11 20:30:00;1 minute;Strange light moving by moon. At approx. 8:30 pm this evening, my husband called for me to hurry up and come outside..above the moon was a white light. It was moving downwards pretty rapidly, in a smooth, almost floating movement. There were no flashing lights on it that we could see. There was a sort of haze arount the object. We watched it continue down for about a minute before we lost it behind some trees. But, before it went behind the trees it seemed like it was beginning to fade out. It was way too slow for a meteorite but didn't seem like a regular aircraft. Just so you know, my husband is a very conservative 53 year old man, I am a 48 year old grandmother of 5 and this is the second UFO sighting ( if indeed that is what it was) we have see from our front yard. The other incident was several years ago and was nothing like this sighting.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space Station flew over Carlsbad, NM, at from 2022 to 2026 hrs. on this date.  Hence, probable sighting of ISS.  PD));32.4116;-104.2427

2 red-orange dots& one white dot over Carlsbad, New Mexico...;2006-06-17 17:30:00;15-20 minutes;2 red-orange dots& one white dot over Carlsbad, New Mexico... Witnessed: 2 red-orange dots/lights in the sky,broad daylight, quite a distance from each other.  Also noticed a white dot/light below the other two moving somewhat faster.  first two did not move as fast as a plane and at one point seemed to be still for about 2-3 minutes.  The white dot moved slower than a plane, too but was faster moving than the red-orange dots.  Note they moved westerly and the closer towards the sun, they did not change in color and eventually were lost due to the sun in our eyes.  This was witnessed by 4 people after getting them to see the first dot that was noticeable.  No trail. No noise. No aura. No sound.  Just the dots.  Should note, the red-orange ones seemed to be L shaped as if laying down backwords.  Prob. bad description, but long ways.  White one: round.;32.4116;-104.2427

I watched it for about 3 minutes, then noticed it was moving slowly.  It moved fairly slow and finally it came across my house, never speeding up at all.  It moved on across the sky and then just disappeared.  From first seeing it until it disappeared, the total time was 10 minutes.;32.4116;-104.2427
