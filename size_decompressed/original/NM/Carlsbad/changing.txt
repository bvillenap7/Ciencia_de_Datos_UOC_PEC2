I saw a line of three to four red lights that twisted to reveal another arm covered with the same kind of lights.  I believe it was an L or boomerang shape.   It was quite a ways off and very dark.  As soon as it turned to reveal the other arm it virtually disappeared.   I drive at night for a living and I am very familiar with things in the night sky.  I've never seen anything like this and wish it would have lasted a lot longer than just a few seconds.;32.4116;-104.2427
