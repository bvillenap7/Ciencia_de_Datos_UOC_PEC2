Both objects appeared very similar, appeared to follow the same trajectory, and both appeared to disappear from sight at similar locations despite being five minutes apart.  I was able to view both crafts with binoculars and take a short low-quality video of the second via an iPhone five.  I did not appear to be a plane or any aircraft I am familiar with nor did they appear to be a meteorite fireball.  The size of the objects would be similar to a low-flying aircraft up to 8 miles away.  Although the light from the objects was not flashing, the appearance did not seem steady, and towards the end of both observations, either travel too far for perception or almost appeared to burnout.
