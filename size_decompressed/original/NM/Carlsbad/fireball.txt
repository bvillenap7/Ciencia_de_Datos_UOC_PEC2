Bright fireball object.;2013-11-20 04:40:00;30 seconds;bright fireball object I was driving down the road coming from Carlsbad NM direction heading to Artesia, and right around mile marker 45 I seen what I though was a light tower out of place and super bright,  at that moment it started to raise in elevation, it was only a 1/2 mile away so I got a good view if it.   It went up about 300feet then dimmed out like a fire burning out then 3 seconds later it lit back up and changed directions and went up another 50 feet and disappeared.;32.4116;-104.2427
