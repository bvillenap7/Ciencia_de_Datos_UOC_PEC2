My boyfriend and I were sitting in his Lincoln across the Pecos River, looking at the night sky.  The craft looked like a metal football field... completely rectangular in shape, and made no noise.  It flew over our heads, and we both saw it.  It had no lights. There were a few indentions on the bottom of the craft, but for the most part, it was just smooth and metalic-looking.  The viewing didn't last but a few seconds, and left us both stunned, asking eachother Did you see that?! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.
