Black triangular object emits buzzing sound.;2000-04-18 12:00:00;2 minutes;Black triangular object emits buzzing sound. It was around about noon, lunch time.  I was working alone, surveying for local municipal power company.  We were going to install a 115kva powerline from north of Aztec, NM, to the Glade Wash area.  I had found a clearing where I had great radio reception, and started to eat my lunch.   I heard a loud buzzing sound, it sounded like thousands of bee buzzing,  I had my windows rolled down and I thought I parked near a hive, so I rolled the windows back up.  The noise only grew louder, I had to see what was making that noise, I expected to see the largest bee hive that could have make that sound.  The sound was all over, I could not  pin point the exact location.   It was then that I looked to the northern horizon and I seen the craft.  It was a flat black triangular object that was approximately a quarter to half a mile away, approximately 30 degrees from the horizon.  It moved slowly and generated a loud buzz, it was like being in a high voltage substation switchyard.   It moved from the east to the west, it moved steadily and maintained the same speed.  I did not see markings or any signs that could have identified it as being an registered aircraft.  There were no windows nor lights.  It was just flat back.  It made that buzzing sound and followed the horizon and moved out of sight.   I didn't bother to follow it and just watched in disbelief.;36.8198;-108.0074
