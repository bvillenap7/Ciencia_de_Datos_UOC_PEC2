huge, bright meteor seen over Aztec, New Mexico;2008-07-23 23:30:00;5-6 seconds;huge, bright meteor seen over Aztec, New Mexico On the evening of July 23rd. at approx. 11:30 p.m. I witnessed a huge meteor over the sky of Aztec and Flora Vista in New Mexico. I was outside (smoking) and saw the huge meteor as it came from the northeast to the southwest. The event lasted for 5-6 seconds which is a long time for a shooting star or meteor. The meteor was bright white with a trial or tail of sparks behind it. The trail of sparks behind it was a bright as sparks from a cutting torch. The object seemed to be skipping across the sky. I am 51 years of age and was wondering if anyone else saw this incredible meteor. There was no noise or smoke trail after the sighting.;36.8198;-108.0074
