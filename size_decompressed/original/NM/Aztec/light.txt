On Sunday night, 08/15/99, at 11:23 PM, I was walking on a nearby hillside with my dogs.  It was very dark and I was facing north-northwest, admiring the Milkyway galaxy.   Suddenly the whole earth lit up.  The trees in front of me were bright green.  My natural instinct was to search for the source of the light.  It was coming from over my right  shoulder.  I turned to my right and saw a brownish trail or streak.  The huge bluish white brilliant light was about the size of a full moon.  Instantly, the light went behind some spotty clouds.  (There were gaps between the little clouds.)  Then spikes of radiation flashed off of the bluish white ball.  The spikes spanned from horizon to horizon.  The ball disappeared and the sky and the earth fell dark.  I was stunned remembering the magnitude of the spikes that shot from east to west then fell downward like an umbrella, or like cat's claws.  They were curved.   I am an audiovisual  engineer and electronics technician.  Sound is my profession.  I waited for at least 10 minitues for a sonic boom or some atmospheric disturbance,but nothing happened,  It was silent.  I heard crickets and there was some kind of night bird churping away.  The sound of the night seemed to magnify!  Trying to comprehend the speed and time that this all took place left me in a state of shock for several days.  It must have taken place outside of our atmosphere because there was no sonic boom, etc.  This dramatically multiplies the distance covered in a few split seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this source of the report on several occasions, and he seems to us to be an excellent witness.  He has technical training, and his description of what he saw is quite precise.  There were many other witnesses to the same event.  A similar event occurred at 2340 hrs ((2240 hrs. Local))., which was witnessed from Las Vegas, NV, and which was reported there on the 11:00 p.m. television news.  We have changed the time here to 23:18 hrs., the time that we believe was the correct time of the flash that was seen west of Albuquerque.
