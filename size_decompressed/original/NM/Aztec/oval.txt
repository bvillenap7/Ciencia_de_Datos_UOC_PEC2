Driving on a county road around midnight above Aztec, another person and I saw 9 or 10 bright oval lights appear in the south sky flying in formation.  Suddenly all of them began zigzagging sporadically all over the sky.  Then they all stopped still for a moment and then quickly sped off individually in the same direction and then they all suddenly disappeared in an instant.  Shockingly, I stopped my car on the road jumping out screaming, “What was that!  What is happening!  What is it!”  The other person in my car saw it and reacted the same as I did.  Whatever they were, it was not normal.;36.8198;-108.0074
