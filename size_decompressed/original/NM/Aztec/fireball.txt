huge, bright meteor seen over Aztec, New Mexico...again.;2008-07-24 23:30:00;5-6 seconds;huge, bright meteor seen over Aztec, New Mexico...again. On the night of Thursday, July 24th for the second night in a row, I witnessed a huge meteor over the towns of Aztec and Flora Vista, New Mexico.  Both happened at 11:30 p.m. on two consecutive night. This seemed to last slightly longer than the night before.  Duration was 5-6 seconds on the 23rd. of July and the 24th sighting seemed a second or so longer. This one came from the Northeast to the Southeast.  Both nights the meteor was huge in size as well as the brightest meteor I have ever seen.  We are very used to seeing meteor's in the sky.  The lack of light pollution makes New Mexico an ideal place for viewing shooting Stars.  But on both nights these were huge and the duraturation lasted longer than any others I have seen.;36.8198;-108.0074

Then they all disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  We can find no city named Aztec, which is located in Colorado.  We wonder whether the source of the report intended to indicated Aztec, New Mexico.
