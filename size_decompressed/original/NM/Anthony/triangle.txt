The craft was less than a quarter mile high and completely silent.  It seemed as if it almost matched the color of the sky except for the light emitted by several lights equally spaced out across the object.  The lights were of a reddish/green color but very dull.  The only reason I saw it was because it flew directly across my line of view.  After it passed me and was at a 45 degree angle from my view, it became impossible to see.  The FAA was reported.;31.9975;-106.6073
