While driving east toward Tatum NM, I saw a star/diamond shaped object in the sky moving  and hovering rapidly around.  Then as we continued to watch the object move erratically in a manner that our aircraft on earth can't do, another one appeared and kept moving around like the first one.  During this sighting, there was a big lighting storm to the south of these objects and I saw at least 6 shooting stars.  After the second appeared I then saw a third and eventually at least 6 of these objects, which they were all in perfect lines in triangle patterns.    I continued to watch these objects until they were covered by clouds. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the sighting might have occurred on Sunday morning, August 19, 2012.  PD));33.1076;-104.3253
