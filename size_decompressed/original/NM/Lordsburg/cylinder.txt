A large stationary craft in the southern skies of New Mexico.;2014-04-15 19:30:00;15 minutes;A large stationary craft in the southern skies of New Mexico. 	I'm a 24 year old truck-driver, familiar with Aircraft and Military planes.  While driving I often look to the sky and try to identify passing air-crafts.  Today, while driving I-10 eastbound in New Mexico and talking to my sister on the phone, I sighted in the southern sky approximately 10,000 to 20,000 ft (altitude)  a large craft comparable to a Boeing 747, hovering in  a stationary point in the sky. It appeared to be metallic with no Navigation lights or wings.  At first it appeared to be cylindrical, I stopped at an exit ramp to take pictures, but my phone was unable to zoom in far enough to take an accurate picture. 	I preceded on down the highway, still watching said craft as it stayed stationary.  I then preceded to contact my uncle, an Aeronautical Engineer, to try and ascertain the identity of the craft.  When we could not conclude on the identity of the craft, he gave me the hotline number for The National UFO Reporting Center.  I then reported my sighting on the hotline number, all the while, still observing the craft. 	It had remained stationary yet it had now become silhouetted and appeared to have two separate parts of nearly equal size.  This entire episode lasted about 15-18 minutes.  The craft never moved, yet eventually I could no longer see it out the passenger window of my truck.;32.316;-108.723
