Triangle.;1993-11-11 22:00:00;Ten seconds;The craft was quiet and swift. The visible lights were of a triangular configuration. At each point was an orange-ish point of light. In the center was pink light, larger than the three other lights. There were no flashing strobes or other lights which might give the craft away as a terrestrial aircraft. The date I provided is *very* approximate. I was much younger when I saw it. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We believe the witness implies New Mexico, not Arizona.  We have amended the state above.  PD));35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Saw triangular craft approaching from horizon from the N.W., approached slowly, silently, and low to the ground.  Passed directly over ;1994-01-03 23:30:00;3-4 minutes?;Saw triangular craft approaching from horizon from the N.W., approached slowly, silently, and low to the ground.  Passed directly over our car as we drove west on I-40.  Very large - 200-300 feet long, with circular thing in front on bottom.  Saw beamwork, tubing, ducts, wiring, lights. My husband and I were travelling on I-40 westbound from Alburquerque, New Mexico toward Arizona.  We were approx. 30-60 miles west of Alburquerque at approx. 11:30 pm when I sighted a lighted object at the horizon line, northwest of us. I guess I must have noticed something unusual about it, because I became fixated on it.  It was triangular in shape, with lights.  I remember at least three lights at the point of triangle at front of craft and one on each back corner. It approached silently, at a very slow steady rate.  I continued to stare at it, and the next thing I knew it was gliding directly overhead, over our vehicle and I-40.  It was huge - I would say 200-300 feet long, and very low to the ground, about 3-5 telephone poles in height from the ground.  I could clearly see the underside of the craft as it was illuminated.  It was so big as it passed over it blocked out most of my view of the sky.  I watched it by looking directly up through the windshield.  It now appeared an elongated octogon-shape (rectangle with corners cut.)  I was viewing the underside: There was a large circular thing in the front center, beamwork, ducts, tubes, wiring of some kind. I would say it was dark grey or black metal.  As it glided across the highway heading southeast, and over the car eventually obstructing my view, I then looked through the driver's side rear window to continue watching it....but it vanished!  Completely!  I looked and looked, all over the sky--nothing!  I continued to be alert and watch the sky as we drove that night, but never saw it or anything else unusual again. I should clarify that I was a passenger, sitting in the front seat.  My husband was driving. I am sending sketches of what I saw via e-mail. Reactions:  I had totally conflicting reactions to this event.  The craft appeared mechanical in nature (lights, beamwork, even rivets) so it could have been some kind of military craft.  HOWEVER...the craft was moving at an extremely slow speed. I would estimate my husband was driving about 60 m.p.h, and the craft was moving slower than that.  It made no sound that I could hear.  What is even more bizarre is that even though I viewed it approaching all the way from the horizon, for several minutes, and I strongly desired to tell my husband to look and pull over I did not. I did not say anything. I just watched it!  There were other cars on the highway, and I could not believe they were not all pulling over and freaking out.  They were all just travelling like everything was normal.  Then it disappeared right after it went overhead!  Something 200-300 feet long just disappeared!  I was completely dumbfounded, and just remember continuing to watch the sky for the duration of drive that night. Although I thought I remembered saying something about it to my husband after it passed by, he had absolutely no recollection of the event at all, and said he did not see anything that night, that he must have been concentrating on driving. I think I did not bring up the subject and describe it in detail to him, including drawing a sketch, until we were in Florida a month later.  How could he have NOT seen something as big as a football field fly directly over our vehicle that night, even if he was watching the road? If it was some secret military craft on a test flight, why would it travel over a major interstate slow and low to the ground, with lights and in plain view?  I can't reason this through, and my reactions were definitely out of character.  It has been perplexing me for a long time, and I've always wondered if anybody else on that highway that night also saw it. So I decided I should report it.  I am now 33 years old, female, married, own my own small business, have a bachelor's degree, and currently live on the west coast. I wish my memory was clearer so I could remember more details - I am capable of drawing and wish I could offer more information.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

It had been stationary the whole time. The object was a triangle shape. It hovered over my head for about ten seconds, until it moved toward it's side as if it had turned. But it remaind stationary the whole time. There was one object and it was white with a red stripe on each corner. At the time I witnessed the object Iwas 10 years old.

Triangular UFO over South Valley High School;1998-08-01 23:00:00;10 Minutes;Triangular UFO over South Valley High School My girlfriend and I had just had dinner with her sister, who we were driving home in the south valley of Albuquerque. We were driving on Arenal Rd West toward Rio Grande High School. When up ahead I noticed a bright spot light under what I thought was a helocopter. Alot of police helocopters hover over the area looking for criminals. I live a few blocks away and was wondering if they were looking for anyone I knew. As we approached the high school we noticed it wasnt a helocopter at all. It was a triangular object about 30 long and ten feet high. It hovered next to a street light in the high school parking lot. I immediately stopped the car and starred in amazement. It wobbled in the air next to the street light like it was about to crash. The wobbling reminded me of model held in the middle by a string. My girlfriend and her sister were very scared as they noticed it wasnt a helocopter at all. The object was about 50 feet away and about 30 feet off the ground, so we got a good view of the object. A few other cars had stopped and watched as well. The object had three small lights at each corner and a bright spot light under it which did not move all thought the craft was wobbling. We watched for about 10 minutes and then the object became stable and moved slowly and silently to the SE over trees and houses. Im sure someone saw the spot light over their homes as the object flew only feet above their houses. We stood and watched untill the object was half a mile away, when we drove after it. We folled it for a mile and the the object dissappeared. I immeadiately called the local news stations who said no one reported anything and I was crazy. Im not crazy and neither are my girlfriend and her sister. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of the incident is approximate.  PD));35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

I was asleep at the time, but my father then yelled, Matt, look at that fighter aircraft! And I woke up to see the last of it, and it was a white triangle, travelling at a amazingly fast speed, my eyes could barely keep up, yet it wasnt making any sound, this was in broad day light too. And then it was gone. My mother claimed she saw another one.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

I was looking out of my east facing bedroom window at the stars, (which I do on a regular basis)and out of the corner of my eye I saw three dim amber colored lights that formed a perfect triangle. The lights on the objectdid not blink and were very dim, not as bright as a star, but none the less quite visible.The triangular object hovered for an instant and then took off in a northerly direction at in my opinion 4 to 5 times faster than a commercial airliner and then disappeared.The craft was absolutley silent.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

I looked up into the Northern clear blue sky and noticed something clear but had a diamond/Glassy/triangular shape to it, so I took off my sunglasses to make sure I was seeing something. At this time the object almost disapeared except I could still see a reflection from the sun on it, then I put my sunglasses back on and it was still there, But moving at a high rate of speed towards the east. I asked my fellow worker if she could see it in the sky and she said no I don't see anything and I said there it is don't you see it. I know it was not a plane or a helecopter or anything of that nature because the item I saw was not solid in my opinion. It was approx, five to six hundred feet up in the sky maybe. As it went towards the east it disapeared within a few seconds. I believe it traveled about 10 to 20 miles in just a few seconds before it disapeared.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Reddish orange glowing triangular object appearing to viewers 30-35 minutes toward the West.;2011-05-08 19:00:00;30-35 minutes;Reddish orange glowing triangular object appearing to viewers 30-35 minutes toward the West On the evening of May 8, 2011, looking to the West, my daughter and I saw an orange/red, larger than an airplane or helicopter light, triangular shaped object in the sky.  The color seemed to glow, changing from yellow orange to a reddish orange.  It was stationary at first. I asked my daughter to keep it in sight, while I went inside the house to get our binoculars.  We took turns looking through the binoculars, always keeping this glowing object in sight. After about 5-6 minutes there was more reddish orange color and the object went straight down about 1/2.....(This measurement is the best I can come up with because I have no way of estimating distance.  Our viewing was from the West side of the city, looking West). This object continued to glow and remained in this position for about 5-6 minutes...then all of a sudden it projected left horizontally about another 1/2 and remained in this position for a few minutes. We continued watching, mesmerized and wondering just, what is it???  for about 30-35 minutes.  During this time its position changed several times from straight up or straight down, horizontal either left or right, until it went straight down below the horizon and we could no longer see it.   We continued looking West for a few minutes, wondering if we'd see it come 'up' again, but it didn't.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Fast, quiet and flying low over Albuquerque, NM;2011-10-27 21:45:00;Seconds;Fast, quiet and flying low over Albuquerque, NM I stepped out onto my balcony to grab a cigarette. I heard what sounded like a glider through the wind which is unusual this time of night. It was different than just the wind or traffic noise from the street which is why it caught my attention. I looked up to see a triangle shaped object moving quickly overhead and passed over the top of my building out of sight. It was quick and a matter of seconds. I was suprised at the light noise, yet silent and also how low overhead the object seemed fly by. It was not as large as I would have expected. There were what seemed like reflective type lights on the bottom but not very obvious unless you are close. As the object passed by, it tilted slightly so the light from the street illuminated the bottom. It was like nothing I've ever seen before. It just whizzed on by.

I live on the westside of Albuquerque at around eight o'clock pm I was walking home from downtown.  I saw a bright light in the sky above me a little more towards the west.   I stopped and started to stare at the object the more I looked the more detail I could make out.  The object had a very bright light on the bottom and smaller less bright lights that came off the top to a point like a pyramid.   After I got home I went out into the backyard to see it again that's when I noticed a second ship.  This one was more towards the southeast over Kirtland air force base.   I could tell they were high because I could see military and commercial aircraft fly under them.  Then my dog started running crazy and barking at the sky.  This scared me so I came inside and refused to go back out there.   I personally believe these were mother ships.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Me and my girlfriend are constantly witnessing strange events in our beautiful New Mexico sky so last was especially strange.   I walked out first and was standing near the street where there was more light then usaul because of the front porch lamp being on.  My girlfriend came out a few minutes afterwards and was standing on the side of the backyard where there almost no light.   Almost as soon as she looked up she started yelling for me saying, Babe, look!!  Look, can you see that?!  What is that?!    So i ran twards the back where she was and saw a giant triangular shaped object that was dark gray and was moving pretty quick and maneuvering in ways that  an airplane couldn't and with absolutely no sound.  We live in a neighborhood that is in line with the airport runway, so lights being on on a aircraft is highly required and this object was stealth.  No lights at all!!   We watched the news to see of anyone else saw it but nothing was reported.  I guess we will just have to keep an eye on our sky .....;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Dark grey, nodular, triangular craft passed overhead above tree line and made absolutely no noise.;2016-08-28 10:30:00;5-7 seconds;Dark grey, nodular, triangular craft passed overhead above tree line and made absolutely no noise. I just discovered your site for reporting UFO sightings.  I don’t know the exact date now, it was a couple of weeks ago, the end of August 2016.  I was in my backyard in Albuquerque, NM at approximately 10:30am when I noticed a large shadow overhead.  I looked up and a craft about the same size as my house was passing overhead just above the tree line, west to east, and passed by in about 5 to 7 seconds before I couldn’t see it any longer because of my neighbor’s house and trees obstructing the view.  The craft was dark grey, triangle shape with no visible lights, markings of any kind, or landing gear, and made absolutely no noise as it passed over. I live in a glide path for commercial airlines, south to north, and see planes every day.  They make noise.  They have smooth body fuselage and wings.  This craft was not a plane.  It was more triangular in shape, and it was not smooth underneath like planes are.  It was very nodular.  I’ve been looking at photos online to see if there is anything like what I saw posted, but can’t find anything in real life.  Closest thing was the Millennium Falcon from Starwars. I am retired, 67 year old male, with good vision and sound mind. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
