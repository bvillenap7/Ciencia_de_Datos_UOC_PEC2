A colorful object was hovering over the Petroglyphs, which backed up to my back yard, and it had no sound.;1993-11-01 23:45:00;10 min.;A colorful object was hovering over the Petroglyphs, which backed up to my back yard, and it had no sound. It was late in the evening when I called my girlfriend in California.  I looked out my window to the backyard and saw this, I guess cigar shaped object hovering over the Petroglyphs.  I went out the door to get a better look.  My first thought that it was a blimp, due to the fact that I was from Los Angeles and they were seen many times in the skies there.  The object had colorful lights, which was not in step with the airplanes or helicopter lights.  The object was just hovering, and then it struck me, THERE WAS NO SOUND COMING FROM THIS OBJECT.  I was still on the phone with my friend and was telling her all about what I was seeing.  I started getting concerned and moved back into my home as I have two small boys.  I continued to watch this object and when it started to finally move, it moved very slowly and then it went away in a flash.  I called the police and asked them if Kirtland AFB was testing some prototype and they said they had no knowledge.  Meanwhile, my friend was still on the phone.  I am an Executive Secretary by trade and the next day at work I told some of my co-workers, and they all laughed. But I know what I saw.  I will report another incident that occured during  the last major meteor shower last year.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
white, cigar shaped, silent and seemed to glow;2006-07-19 19:20:00;30 seconds;I was outside, using my ab chair, when I saw it. It was white, cigar shaped, silent and seemed to glow. I looked at it for maybe 30 seconds and decided it could probably be a blimp, but I ran inside to get my camera anyway. It took no longer that 20 seconds to get back out with my camera and it was gone. I spent several minutes looking for it, because I thought it couldn't have gone that far, but I never saw it again. Just as I was going back inside two helicopters from Kirtland AFB took off in the direction it had been going. I also noticed some very high jets flying in that direction. I have no clue what it was, but I watch planes fly over all day and it wasn't a plane, it was also too damn big to be a bird. It could have been a dirigible, but if so it was a very fast moving one.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Cigar Craft Cited by Sandia Mountains in Albuquerque.;2006-08-10 11:00:00;15 seconds;Cigar Craft Cited by Sandia Mountains in Albuquerque My wife and I were driving north on Tramway.  We were in a convertible car.  I observed a stationary craft in front of one of the Sandia mountains.  I knew it could not be a plane.  They do not fly that close to the mountains.  Helicopters rarely fly in the area.   I next thought of a hang glider which might be closer than I am estimating.  But I noticed my wife was looking at it. It was a cigar-shaped craft.  Because of its position, it was about 8,000 feet up.  Based upon its position when compared to the mountains, we estimated it to be about 500 feet long and 20 feet tall.  It was mostly white but was red at one end.  It hovered for several seconds.   Then, in about a 1/4 second, it flew east across the mountains and disappeared out of sight.  My wife and I discussed what we saw and agreed upon what we saw. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Bright White disk shape hovering, then suddeny dissapears. Very shocking.;2007-09-21 12:20:00;30-60 seconds;Bright White disk shape hovering, then suddeny dissapears. Very shocking. It was just after lunch, and my friend and I were were running late to class. We were the only ones in the courtyard. Just as we were walking, I looked up in the sky. The sky was fifty percent cloudy, but in a clear blue spot, I noticed a defined white saucer or cigar shaped object moving at a slow pace, almost as if it wasn’t moving at all. We knew immediately that it wasn’t a plane because it left no trail and it was moving much to slowly. Then, it started moving downwards diagonally very slowly. Then, it seemed to come to a stop and hovered for about ten seconds. It made an abrupt turn and started moving very quickly southbound, and within seconds it disappeared from our sight.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Short cigar shaped object with rays of light eminating from one end stayed in the sky for 2 hrs+.;2009-08-19 22:00:00;3 hrs;Short cigar shaped object with rays of light eminating from one end stayed in the sky for 2 hrs+. Initially this was a white light that emitted periodic white starburst-like rays that stayed fairly close to the center point of light. It would periodically move in a jerky manner and then stay completely stationery for a while. When the object came closer it appeared to be a stubby cigar-shaped tube and continued to emit light rays periodically from a central light point. At one time, for about 20, minutes a central point of light would appear (like a stamen on a flower) and the object would rotate around as though it were a satellite dish scanning the area below it. I went and got a neighbor to see it so I could be sure I wasn’t losing my mind or something. He didn’t know what to make of it but didn’t really seem to care and went back inside. I sat in my truck bed, realizing it was not a man-made object, and opened my arms wide and tried to mentally will it to come to me (if this makes any sense). To my amazement, it moved almost directly overhead and mov! ed closer, at which point I could no longer see the object but only the radiating light. It came closer to me and became like a cat or fox’s face with the light rays being like whiskers or something. It would come closer, actually very close, and immediately recede if I moved arms or blinked, as though it were tentative or shy. It seemed to prefer it when I crossed my arms over my chest rather than spread them wide. After ~15 or 20 minutes of this the cat’s face transformed slowly into almost the classical “alien’s face”. Then it seemed as though I was looking down the wrong end of a telescope everything became dark around the outside and a narrowing circle of light was at the end with a being at the center who became increasingly wrinkled as the circle closed. I felt almost paralyzed but really started to freak out so I waved my arms and the whole thing retreated immediately. It then came closer and retreated but with the “alien face,” not the cat’s face. I watched this f! or probably 30 minutes and then figured that while this was a ! unique a nd weird thing going on there was no point in watching it any more and went inside to go to bed. I did look out the door a few times and the thing stayed around for maybe 10 minutes and then was gone. I know this makes me sound like a whack job or something, but I’m generally a very skeptical person and have multiple science degrees. So there it is.

Night sky turned white with a cigar shaped object in the middle of a circle of light;2010-07-31 04:15:00;20 seconds;Night sky turned white with a cigar shaped object in the middle of a circle of light I was standing in a parking lot at 4:15am in Albuquerque near I25 and Osuna Road.  I was talking with a fellow truck driver when the sky lit up a very white light and the other driver jumped and asked what's that?  I turned and saw about half the sky was lit up with a very constant (not flickering like fireworks) light and in about the center of the lighted area was a gray cigar shape. It never moved or made any noise.  After 10 seconds the cigar shaped object started to disappear. It's size never changed.  After 5 seconds the object was gone.  The light started to dim and after 3 seconds (or so) it was gone.  There were no thunderstorms in the area, only a few very small clouds.  No lightning anywhere was visible.  I am a licensed pilot and don't drink or do drugs.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

I pointed it out to my wife, and she thought it was too fat to be an airplane, and then it just disappeared. It is difficult to describe what we saw, and other than its appearance of flying as an airplane, we couldn’t fully grasp what we were looking at.  It was glowing as though the sun, at sunset,  was reflecting off of it, but it was 11:00 A.M.. This sighting happened at the same location where my wife and I had seen a UFO a few years ago that we reported, which at first looked like a white balloon (across the street from Whole Foods on Wyoming and Academy in Albuquerque).;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Bright pink vertical cigar-shaped object observed in evening sky of Albuquerque to the west;2016-09-09 19:30:00;about ten minutes;bright pink vertical cigar-shaped object observed in evening sky of Albuquerque to the west Last evening, Friday, September, 2016 at 7:30 p.m., my friends and I witnessed a glowing pinkish light suspended in the western skies of Albuquerque.  It was the shape of an elongated cigar positioned vertically.  It did not move or fade off as a vapor trail would.  A bright object was positioned a good deal north of the UFO, possibly Saturn.  Not long past sunset, the backdrop was a light pearly grey.  The object was roughly parallel on the horizon with the planet.  When I put my glasses on for greater detail, I could tell this was a specific, contained shape. On my drive home headed southbound, I could no longer see the pink UFO.  It had disappeared.  I know it was gone because the bright planet used as a reference point remained, but the UFO did not.  Even with the silhouette of trees, I should have seen this bright pink object.  It was not that low in the sky.  Once home, I went online to see if anyone had reported weather balloons over Albuquerque that night there were no such reports.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Linear strand of approximately 5-10 white lights moving quickly and silently across the sky;2021-01-09 06:32:00;2-3 minutes;Linear strand of approximately 5-10 white lights moving quickly and silently across the sky The object appeared in the east sky, above the silhouette of the mountains, north of where I was standing.  There was a strand of white lights, approximately 5-10 lights, running horizontally.  The object then quickly moved southward in an irregular pattern-it zigzagged a little and rotated, causing the lights to shift from running horizontally to vertically.  The lights remained in the vertical pattern.  The object moved to a point slightly south from where I was standing and stopped.  It stayed in that position, still above the silhouette of the mountains.  The object remained there for approximately a minute.  The sun was starting to rise, so the lights were no longer visible.  The event lasted between 1 to 2 minutes and there was no sound coming from object.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

I was trimming my plants and watering them.I looked over to the left of the grow tent, in my grow room, and noticed a small tic-tac or cigar shaped UFO or Alien Drone. It was more like a Tic-Tac than a cigar. Me being as curious as I am, I REACHED OUT WITH MY HAND   to touch the gray and white UFO that was approximately 11 inches long by 6 inches wide. The length could have been longer because I could not seen the front in the direction going IT WAS LIGHT GRAY ON THE TOP AND BLENDED IN THE MIDDLE,INTO A WHITE COLOR ON THE BOTTOM. I REACHED OUT TO TOUCH IT AND I GRABBED IT.THE UFO or UFO DRONE UNDULADED like a SLOW Snake when I grabbed it. When I touched and grabbed the Tic-Tac shaped Drone/UFO  undulated forward and as it undulated forward MY HAND RELEASED IT WITHOUT A FIGHT OR STRUGGLE. AS IT MOVED FORWARD IT WAS LIKE IT DISAPPEARED INTO A BOX. I OPENED ALL THE BOXES AND THERE WAS NOTING TO BE FOUND. IT JUST DISAPPEARED INTO  ANOTHER DIMENSION. THE MATERIAL ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE CRAFT FELT LIKE A THICK SKINNED OBJET. IT FELT ALMOST LIKE SHARK SKIN BUT THICKER. I WANT TO SAY IT ALSO FELT RUBBERY, BUT, AT THE SAME TIME IT WAS DIFFERENT LIKE NOTHING I HAD EVER FELT BEFORE.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
