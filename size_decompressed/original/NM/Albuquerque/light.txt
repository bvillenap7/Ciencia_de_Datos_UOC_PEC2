I observed a small red light looked like an airplane light but it was'nt flashing it was going west the speed of a commercial airplane in the sky.  It then stopped turned into an orbish(a bit larger) light pinkish purple (ultraviolet looking- like a black light). In the same stopped position it toned down the light into a little purple dot (looked like a star) and like a rubberband it zipped back east into space and eventually disappeared into all the stars. When the light toned down in color the sighting ended very quickly (approx.10sec) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD));35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Two VERY bright stars ...one on left suddenly moved across sky to left in downward arc and up then stopped abruptly.  Object on right;1999-06-10 22:30:00;30 minutes;Two VERY bright stars ...one on left suddenly moved across sky to left in downward arc and up then stopped abruptly.  Object on right started moving slowly to right.  Third object blinked on approx. 15 minutes later when we were trying to chase the left object. Driving to CA for vacation on I-40 westbound near Alb. NM at 10:30 p.m.Thursday night, June 10th.  I was in passenger seat looking at millions of stars.  Noticed two intensely bright stars in the northern sky, about 20-25 degrees above the horizon, and asked my fiancee to pull over so I could look at them.  They were, at that time, parallel to the car.  Watched them for about a minute then got out the binoculars to see if we could see what they were.  All we saw were just intensely blue light with what seemed to be an aura around them, which could have been atmospheric interference.  They were still and looked just like really bright stars but they were just too bright and too big.  Very suddenly, the light on the left took off at an amazingly fast speed to the west, dipped down a bit, then up and just STOPPED in the sky again.  The object on the right just started to mosey through the sky toward the east.  We continued to drive west on I-40 trying to get to where it was, to put it parallel to the car again and see what the heck it was.  The road was straight, we were driving like crazy to catch up to it when another light just blinked on in the sky right in front of us.  (That was a real shocker!)  It started moving slowly in the direction of the light which had moved so quickly to the west, then just went away, perhaps behind a mountain.  We never could catch up to the westbound light.  We watched it for about 30 minutes or so, got to a little town and lost it. The light on the right had what seemed to be a blinking light of somekind...no noise but it must have been pretty high.  We had turned the car off and were in the middle of nowhere. The light which blinked on in front of us appeared to have a light, as well but I really don't think either of them was a plane or hellicopter.  I could be wrong.  But the light which darted off to the left was amazing!  We were driving at 75/80 mph for at least half an hour and never did get it parallel to the car again...not even close.  The sudden movement to the west was instantaneous...maybe two seconds to go, which must have been, better than 50 miles. My fiancee is 54, director of an arts organization.  I am 46 and a festival promoter, former restaurant owner.  My daughter is a 19 year old college student.  We were headed to a family reunion in Tahatchipi, CA.

On a clear cloudless summer afternoon in the summer of 2000, I was hiking alone in the Sandia Mountains just east of Albuquerque, NM.;2000-06-01 15:00:00;40 minutes;On a clear cloudless summer afternoon in the summer of 2000, I was hiking alone in the Sandia Mountains just east of Albuquerque, NM.  I had just climbed a steep hill, and decided to rest on my back on top of a large flat rock. It was around 3 p.m. in the afternoon, and the moon was about one-third of the way between straight up and the western horizon. I was watching military jets as they raced across the sky leaving vapor trails behind them. I then spotted a bright light, similar to the planet Venus, moving eastward at a speed similar to the jet aircraft.  I assumed that it was another jet much higher up, and the sunlight was glinting off it.  It was not leaving any vapor trail.  As it passed almost straight above me, it started making a sharp arc of 90 degrees (about the same radius as the moon), and simultaneously coming to a complete stop.  I kept watching it, but after about 20 minutes, it was noticeably starting to slowly fade, but still not moving again. After 10 more minutes, it had completely faded away, and I could no longer see it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I watched a light which looked like it was not in the atmostphere, it looked like a star until it started dancing around, making quick dashes and drops only to come back to it's starting point, it made these figure eight movements and spirals, as if to gain attention, this was going on for about ten minutes and then made a quick dash away and I lost it in the stars.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
At twilight we saw through binoculars three bright lights arranged in an inverted triangle making small darting movements in place.;2000-09-25 19:30:00;30 minutes;At twilight we saw through binoculars three bright lights arranged in an inverted triangle making small darting movements in place. I am a physician.  At about twilight my husband noticed a bright light in the southern sky.  To my naked eye it looked like a large, bright star.  When observed through binoculars, I saw three lights arranged in an inverted triangle.  The bottom light appeared more red than the two at top, initially, which looked more yellowish in color.  It appeared stationary to me at this point.  We went outside (had been on our enclosed patio) and saw two neighbors, to whom we gave the binoculars to observe the lights.  One (occupation unknown) noted that the lights were moving.  I looked again, and noted that through the binoculars small darting movements could be observed, although the lights remained in the same relationship to each other and in the same general location.  As we watched, the lights became more reddish in color, and gradually became smaller and smaller, until they were no longer observable.  Neither my husband nor I have ever seen anything like this before and aren't sure what to make of it.  We saw a plane in the general area. ((NUFORC Note:  The report is somewhat reminiscent of the red lights that have been reported over Arizona, Illinois, and several other states since February of this year.  Generally, when a stationary light at night is reported to us, we attempt first to eliminate the possibility that is is a twinkling star, planet, or other celestial body.  However, such an object should not simply disappear from sight on a clear night, we feel.  PD));35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Small white light slowely gaining altatude over Albuquerque Morning sky!;2003-03-29 05:35:00;15+ min. still happening;Small white light slowely gaining altatude over Albuquerque Morning sky! I was on my computer and looked to my left which is my glass sliding door and saw a light. The sun is barely out and theres enough light where there are no stars. so I though it was a holicopter or plane but both have multi-lights that flash and this had non. I watched it and it looked as it was completely still. After watching for a couple of minutes I could see it was slowely moving up and to the left toward downtown Albuquerque. It looks as if its moved a couple hundred feet up in altitude. Its just a little white light. Like what you would see as a star but it moves. I am not sure if its a UFO because it has not moved erratic or fast. It maybe a hot air balloon, they fly them here but I dont know of they have lights on them or if they do if they are that brigth to see that high. Its 6:00 Am and I just lost eyesight of it because the sun is out more and blocking its light. The object was in the direction of Kirkland Air Force Base. Please let me know what you think or find out. Thank You.  I believe in the possibilities of UFO's but I must rule out natural explanations first.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Saw two steady red lights moving very fast, very silently, jerking around, East to West over Albuquerque, NM.;2003-08-30 23:55:00;30 seconds;Saw two steady red lights moving very fast, very silently, jerking around, East to West over Albuquerque, NM. There are low clouds over the city tonight, and the local Indian Casino is using searchlights in a repeating pattern to make pictures on the underside of the clouds, as they often do.  I was on my balcony, facing south, looking up at the clouds, watching the searchlights.  I could see what I believe is Mars just above the tops of the clouds.  I noticed a pair of red lights (they could have been just about any color, I am color-blind) moving quickly across the underside of the clouds in a west-to-east direction, towards Sandia Mountain.  I first thought that it was someone with a powerful laser pointer having some fun - the lights moved in a jerky manner, as a light directed from the ground might, but I have tried to shine a laser pointer on the underside of a cloud at night before, and I realize that they are not powerful enough to do this at such a distance.  In any case, I was startled when the lights came to the edge of the cloud formation and did not disappear, as they would have if they were merely lights being shone on the bottom of the cloud by people below on the ground.  The lights instead continued on and quickly vanished over the top of Sandia Mountain.  I waited to see if the lights would return, but they did not.  I turned around and noticed my kitchen clock - it was nearly midnight, so I would put the time of my observation at around 11:55 P.M. Mountain Time.  It was only after the lights vanished that I realized that they had moved without making a sound.  With the low-hanging clouds tonight, if it had been military or civilian jets, they should have made a noise I could hear.  Also, I believe that jets have blinking lights - these were on steady and bright.  Also, jets tend to move in a straight line - these lights jerked back and forth, not a lot, but far more than a jet could do.  I have never made any kind of a report before, and this may mean nothing, but it was interesting.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

The sun had just set and we have lately been looking for Mars in the sky. I first looked to the south western sky and I saw a bright light as bright as Mars but in the wrong place for that time.The light though was a redish color. It was not the light of a planes nav or landing lights as I am a pilot and know what they look like. After looking at this bright lite for a few minutes it faded away as if on a south westerly course.The sky was quite clear with unrestriced visability.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Three bright lights that were huddled together than began to seperate and disappeared.;2003-10-10 22:00:00;3 minutes;Three bright lights that were huddled together than began to separate and disappeared. I live in Albuquerque NM and about 3 years ago my wife and I saw something really strange.  I never said anything about my experience except to my close friends.  One night my wife and I were driving home from the Gym.  She was driving and I was looking out the window like I almost always do.  I noticed three very bright lights in the sky.  If I remember correctly they were red, green and purple looking.  It was a very unnatural light.  Very Neon like.  They did not flash or anything like that.  At first they were huddled together.  After about a minute of looking at these lights I told my wife to look.  We were on a major road in the middle of town.  She saw the lights.  I kept watching the lights and noticed that they were slowly moving away from each other.  One stayed in the original spot where I saw the lights and the other two were drifting oppositely away from the original location.  The two lights that were moving separated a lot.  I told my wife to keep looking at the lights and she did when she could because she was driving.  I kept watching these slow moving lights for about 2 or 3 minutes and then they just disappeared pretty much all at once.  We were at the corner of NM 528 and Ellison right near the Wal-mart heading north on 528.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Possible Weather Balloon?;2004-09-16 19:30:00;30 min;Possible Weather Balloon? Walking south approximately at sunset, a stationary object was seen in the south/southwestern sky. Unknown altitude, but seemed to not be of very high altitude. It appeared to be near or south of the vacinity of Albuquerque Sunport Airport, normal air traffic was witnessed as well. It was very bright, altough at first thought it may be a planet. However, after arriving home and watching from my window, it was becoming brighter. I went outside, saw a neighbor with camera and telescope. He saw it as well and took pictures. It appears as possible weather balloon, semi-roundish upsidedown cone shape, with series of cylindrical objects attached to sides and ropes hanging from it, holding something at an apex. However, the odd thing. From the time I went from my window, to outside to observe, in a cloudless dark sky, it disappeared.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Brilliant white light west of Albuquerque;2005-09-20 19:28:00;10 minutes;Brilliant white light west of Albuquerque When leaving the gym tonight at 19:28 I noticed an obscenely brilliant white light due west roughly 30 degrees above the horizon and recently-set sun.  For a moment I was filled with the Holy S*#! factor but then calmed as I realized it was probably a high-altitude balloon.  (Many years ago I saw something similar and checked it out in binoculars and saw the distinct upside-down teardrop translucent balloon shape.) About 10 minutes later I noticed it taking on an orangish hue and it quickly faded red and dark as the sun went farther below the horizon. I'm 100% convinced it was just a balloon but I wanted to submit this report to help clarify any others you may receive. I am an amateur astronomer and have a background in physics.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

I saw it first at about 60 degrees to the north.  It moved south almost directly overhead.  At about 100 degrees it started fading and turning red. In less than 10 seconds it disappeared.

Witnessed 6-7 jet aircraft following small orange light which became extremely bright and shot off;2007-10-26 23:06:00;3 minutes;Witnessed 6-7 jet aircraft following small orange light which became extremely bright and shot off Witnessed six to seven jet aircraft fly east to west over my home a little after 11:00 pm, they were fairly loud and my window was open so they caught my attention.  I pulled a chair over to the window, which faces North, and opened it all the way. That night the moon was almost full and it was fairly bright outside.  The aircraft moved out of site to the west and turned around and began flying east toward the Sandia Mountains, but this time I noticed a faint orange light was leading the pack of aircraft.  It was very small, very faint and I could make out no shape, which was odd because the moon was almost directly above.  The shape of the aircraft was quite clear and they also had 3 white blinking lights underneath them.  I continued observe the jets and the orange light fly towards the mountains for app. 30 to 45 seconds, at that time I was observing them from behind the line they were in.  When all I could see was was the white lights on the jets an extremely bright light shot out in front of them, It was orange but extremely bright, so bright that it appeared bigger in size. It moved up at a 55, 60 degree angle and curved straight up.  Afterwards the jets continued to fly towards the mountains and out of site.  I have no explanation for what the light was, there must be more witnesses.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

When first sighting the light it was moving unusually fast and changed course after a few minutes and then conducted erratic movements.;2008-07-18 03:15:00;15 minutes;When first sighting the light it was moving unusually fast and changed course after a few minutes and then conducted erratic movements. I woke up a 02:19 and made myself a cup of coffee and sat outside on the front patio enjoying the peace and quiet.  From the patio which faces east I have a 180 degrees view. At approximately 03:15 I was looking to the north and noticed a dull yellow/orange light moving from west to east across the Rio Puerco valley.  I estimated that the aircraft/light was 6 to 8 miles away and moving much faster than the normal aircraft on  approach to Albuquerque International Airport which is nearly due east 19.5 miles to the control tower.  I am guessing that the altitude was 5000 AGL.  This is only a guess. I followed the object with the naked eye until it entered a low thin cloud.  I was curious about the fast moving light so I got up out of my chair and search for the object.  After a minute or so the object appeared out of the top of the cloud.  At this point the light began to flash a very bright red and white strobe.  The object headed west again and seemed to trace it's path back.  I went into the house and got my 8x35 filed glasses and video camera. I returned outside and followed the light with the field glasses. Then the light began to jump around.  Up and down and left to right.  At first I thought I might be moving the field glasses.  There was a large star in the northeast that was in the field of view and it was not moving, so it was the object that was jumping around. I went to the north patio to follow the light's westerly track. The light moved across the Rio Puerco valley at a rapid pace, but not beyond current F16 military aircraft capabilities which operate out of Kirkland Airbase (ABQ International). At this point I tried to video the light, but the battery was dead.  The valley is approximately 5 miles wide where the light made its westerly track and it took approximately 5 minutes to cross the valley.  As the object crossed over the Rio Puerco River it began to jump around again.  The erratic movements covered the entire field of view of my field glasses.  Again I tried to make sure I wasn't moving the field glasses, but there were no stars visible in the west, northwest because of a slight cloud cover and the brightness of the moon high in the south, southwest, but I did use the edge of the western horizon as a reference point when possible.  Same results the light was jumping around. During the period of erratic movements the object was flashing a red and white strobe light similar to conventional aircraft.  I followed the light/object for several more minutes as it seemed to pass over the north lava fields of Mt Taylor.  At this point it was not moving oddly, but the red and white strobes continued and I returned into the house. The temperature was approximately 70 degrees and there were clusters of thin clouds.  Visibility was very good.  Humidity was high for the Rio Puerco valley.  A near full moon was high in the Southwest.  Winds were from the north at 1 to 2 knots. I am a former general aviation pilot and currently fly microlight aircraft (powered paramotors) and I trained pilots to fly powered paramotors for 9 years.  I retired from training in 2007.

Bright light heading for Earth near Albuquerque, NM;2009-05-01 19:30:00;3 minutes;Bright light heading for Earth near Albuquerque, NM Pictures of this were taken just as the sun was going down. I have emailed three photos of this UFO event to you. I was heading South on Hwy 550 from Bloomfield, NM and was about 50 to 60 miles North of Albuquerque.  The pictures were taken with a Canon Digital Camcorder  Model NTSC ZR200. When I first saw two bright lights in the sky to my left, about 10:00 or 11:00 in the sky, I pulled my car over and got my camera. Two other vehicles pulled over behind me and appeared to be watching this, also. The light balls were not moving much at this point.  I was so excited, I forgot to put my camera on movie mode so all I have are the still photos. Two light beams came down from the sky at an angle from the two light balls to my left. The light beams changed their angle a few times as the light balls moved a little.  Then, suddenly the two light balls formed into one larger light ball.  The two light beams coming to earth formed into three beams, then instantly, there was only one light beam. The light ball came to Earth VERY FAST at an angle following the one remaining light beam.  Then the light ball got much brighter, like it was on fire and it was leaving a fire trail behind it, not a long one. As it got closer to Earth, it looked like an explosion took place.  I snapped a picture of this explosion then it took off for the sky again.  It was traveling very fast.  It went up and over the hill to the right in the photo then went straight up in the sky at a rapid rate of speed.  It disappeared in a matter of a few seconds very high in the sky.  There was no noise whatsoever. I dropped my camera after taking the picture of the explosion and took off in my car.  I looked for signs of fire on the ground to the right of the highway where it might have been close to the ground and saw nothing. It appeared to me that the explosion may have happened about 1/2 mile ahead of me. My Father was a Navy jet pilot (career Navy) so I was raised around all kinds of aircraft.  This was not a normal aircraft.  I am a bookkeeper and office manager for an accounting firm.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

About twenty minutes latter as I looked toward the upward northwest sky I saw another light glow and travel at the same time.  It dimmed and kept moving west to east.  It lit again and traveled some more and then disappeared.  I have seen something similar and wonder what it is.  My wife saw a flying wing last year and we see other lights on occasion.  Ufo’s maybe I don’t know. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

It was brightly lit, but not entirely. Saw lights hanging above the mountains that I never saw before, or since.  I thought it could be as far away from me 5 miles in the direction of Kirkland Airforce base.  But if it were that far I wouldn't really see it.  I thought it may have been oval but there were bright lights preventing me from seeing the full body since it was dark out.  It hung in the air.  I eventually stopped watching it thinking it observing the area and might even see me watching it.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Did not see an object, just long and fast bursts of extremely bright, white light some of which shot off at different angles.;2012-03-06 20:30:00;approx. 1 min.;Did not see an object, just long and fast bursts of extremely bright, white light some of which shot off at different angles. When:   Tuesday evening, March 6, 2012 Time:  Approx. 8:40 pm (Albuquerque time) Viewed from:  Airplane en route from Chicago beginning of approach into ABQ over populated area - could begin to see major roads and lights from buildings, homes, etc. Observation:  From the rear, port side of the plane:  a series of several (maybe 6 or 7) extremely bright bursts of light.  Given the altitude, it seemed too bright and too wide to be the beam of (for instance) the light on a police helicopter.  Furthermore, a couple of the lights turned very quickly at right angles and did not sweep in the way a searchlight would have moved. The best way that I can describe the 'shape' of the light is to ask you to picture a comet.  There's the head of the comet and then the tail that gradually fades out. These bursts of light were like that, only they were in reverse of the direction that a comet would go.  In other words, if traveling west, the tail would come first and then the brightness would race ahead and then just black out. I can't guess the distance that they moved over, but from the plane window, I would say it covered a good 6 inches, so on the ground, that would have been pretty far, maybe a mile??  The lights were bright white.  Again, a couple of the lights turned in different directions, but the majority of them just went straight. There weren't a lot of people on the plane and I didn't hear folks talking about it as they got off in ABQ.  I did go up and talk to the pilot before the new passengers boarded for the rest of the flight to Tucson, but he didn’t see anything because he was focused on the approach to the airport.  He suggested it might have been some military exercises, but since it was over a populated area,  I discount that theory. Whatever it was, was very interesting and certainly unforgettable!;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

I thought at first it was a large aircraft lit up with all the lights on the bottom in the shape of a triangle, then all the lights switched places, telling me it was 12 separate aircraft.

As I watched with a friend it suddenly “shot” at extreme speed all the way to the western horizon, then back to origin.   It then appeared to be descending as it was growing larger and brighter.  After about 60 seconds, it shot again off to the south eastern horizon and then back.  After about another 30 seconds it shot at extreme speed north until it was lost below the horizon.   We watched for a few minutes and as it did not return we got into our cars.  Just as we did this it suddenly came back from below the northern horizon, paused about a third of the way across the sky and then shot again at a high rate of speed straight east.

I was stargazing on my porch that night because the sky was so clear.   At first I thought I was seeing a pulsing, twinkling star, but then it began to change colors rapidly, including red, green, and white.  The object would stay in one spot for a few seconds, then slowly move a short distance in random directions (up, down, left, right).   I called my adult son outside to see it because he had mentioned clearly seeing the same thing several nights in a row this week on his way back from work on a bicycle at 4 or 5 a.m. He confirmed that this was the same thing he had been sighting, but he had seen it in the southern part of the city near Kirtland AFB and the Albuquerque airport in the wee hours of the a.m.  His sightings also included purple as one of the colors. The light was directly west in the sky.  Our home is close to the exact center of the city near the crossing of I-25 and I-40.  Other events going on this week were the Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta, and fireworks the same night as my sighting.  However, the balloon events are held in the far north part of the city, nowhere close to where I clearly viewed this object. It had to be a distance of approximately 10 miles.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Background:  I am an elementary school teacher and I live in Albuquerque.  I have seen unusual objects in the sky before, but primarily in my hometown of Santa Fe.  I am a frequent sky-watcher.  Living near an airport, I am very familiar with objects that are identifiable, like planes and helicopters and how they move and what lights they emit as well as sounds they make traveling overhead. I went out to my backyard to check on my dog.  I looked up as I always do to check out the stars.  I was looking at the east sky when I noticed what looked like a star, a white light, moving slowly straight up in the sky. I then saw a blinking green light positioned vertically under it, also moving up. The lights changed position. They moved from being vertical to being horizontal to the sky line.  When this happened the white light changed color: turned orange-red.  The blinking green light began blinking red then green. The began to move faster, as they picked up speed I could hear what sounded similar to plane noises, but different, almost a rumble.  The sound was loud compared to their distance away from my house.  I am used to hearing plane engine noise as I live near Double Eagle Airport, which is about 10 miles from my house.  Normally when the sound is as loud as I heard it, the planes appear closer to my location. The objects were traveling due west,not Northwest, which is where the airport is located from my house.. As the two objects began to travel west, dogs all over started barking as it flew overhead.  My own dogs were appearing agitated and looking up at the sky. They traveled together leading was the orange-red light that was not blinking at all, followed by the blinking red and green light. I fixed my eyes on the space between the lights and something seemed fuzzy about the space in between, almost as if there was something being masked in the middle. They begin to travel pretty quick.  I ran inside and then to the front yard which faces west.  I was able to watch them travel west until I could no longer make out the lights.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Albuquerque NM I-25 Southbound 7:00pm (Sharp) Mountain Time 1/13/16.	   Heading south on the freeway I saw two adjacent lights flying west directly ahead in my line of sight while driving.  The lights did not blink and seemed to be part of the same craft though no actual body of the craft was visible only two round lights travelling together at the same speed no sound.  Within a matter of seconds the lights dimmed out of sight and for the remainder of my 15-minute drive along the freeway where I have a open view of the sky, the lights did not reappear. Approximately two years ago I had an encounter with a UFO while driving with two friends maybe around 8:00pm.  Two adjacent lights dim yellow-orange, hovering somewhat close to the ground in an area with absolutely no tall buildings.  They were solid in color and did not blink such as a plane does. As we turned the car back to get a better look they had vanished. Further Description:   	Lights seemed to be about the height of a helicopter •	Traveled short distance before disappearing •	Traveled in straight line •	Faster than a helicopter •	Yellow orange, resembled the brightness of a plane in the distance •	DID NOT BLINK AT ALL!! Which I assume violates FAA regulations •	Several blinking aircraft in the vicinity •	Space between lights must have been massive, larger than a blimp  As the lights dimmed out of sight I would compare it to a falling star as it dies smoothly fading out of sight. The lights must have been attached to the same craft that was not visible or hidden by the night. The space between the lights could’ve held a blimp between them but traveled too fast. Distance from UFO was not clear since no actual body was visible. Either way the space between the lights is unexplainable, much too large for any aircraft of my knowledge. The lights were so clear from the freeway, many others must have seen. Background: 20-year-old college student, male, and understands very clearly what planes, helicopters, blimps, satellites, meteors, and weather balloons look like.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

On August 12, 2016, at about 9 PM Mountain Time, I was sitting in an open patio with a friend in NE Albuquerque.  I was gazing up at the night sky during a relatively clear night, with only a few broken clouds north of the city.   I noticed a jet airplane flying west, directly over Albuquerque, with blinking lights clearly visible.  As I followed the path of the jet, my eye was drawn to another object in the night sky moving from WSW to ENE.  It was a steady bright red, about the size of the planet Mars. I knew it was not a jet, or a helicopter, because it had no blinking lights.   At first, I thought perhaps it might be a satellite, but then I realized it was moving faster than a satellite and was too bright.  The intensity of the light seemed to brighten and then dim.   I mentioned the light to my friend, and as he found it in the sky, the light made a sudden 90 degree turn to the north, and then faded completely out in just a matter of 2 or 3 seconds.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

PD));2017-11-12 01:00:00;30 minutes;High altitude point of light SE of Albuquerque II I again sighted this light from my same location on Louisiana Blvd NE midway between Lomas and Constitution on the west side of the street that I had first reported on 10/24/17.  It is the same light I sighted and reported to both NUFORC and MUFON on 10/24/17.  It was again changing colors (red, blue, green, & white) while hovering stationary SSE of my location, not making any sound, and at an altitude about the same as that of a commercial airliner. I go out to my car almost every night around 12:00 AM to 1:00 AM to remove my radar detector from my car so it doesn't get stolen, and I have looked every time I go out there since my previous report on 10/24/17 to see if this light was there.  Up until this sighting, I have not seen it since 10/24, and there have been no clouds to obscure it if it had been there between 10/24 and 11/12. After my report to MUFON about the 10/24 sighting, I received an email from their investigator informing me there were no visible stars, planets, or other celestial bodies in the sky SE of Albuquerque where the object I saw was located the person informed me there is a visible star NE of my location, but not SE.  This light looks to be too low to be a celestial body yet too high to be a helicopter or some other such aircraft, and since it is hovering in the same place for an extended period of time, it cannot be a fixed wing aircraft. I observed this light for 20 to 30 minutes before going back inside.  I first saw the object at 1:00 AM and went back inside sometime after 1:20 AM.  I took several minutes of video of the light.  https://youtu.be/kWj03TRNYTc ((NUFORC Note:  In a follow-up telephone conversation with the witness, he confirmed that the object he witnessed was Sirius.

Several orange lights moving slowly, which faded out, one by one.;2018-01-01 00:00:00;10 minutes;Several orange lights moving slowly, which faded out, one by one. I was standing outside getting ready to ring a bell as is my New Year's tradition when I spotted three glowing red-orange dots. They were low to the NE, rising slowly and steadily up southwards. The top two made a sharp curve west and faded out. By the time the third, flickering slightly, slowly faded from view, 5 or 6 more in a loose constellation followed it in the same direction, disappearing one by one. A very bright one appeared afterwards, taking the same curved route as the first two. It took nearly 10 minutes for the whole spectacle to play out.  I'm not sure of the exact number because once I realized they were not helicopters, I was busy trying to get a picture. Afterwards, I thought they might have been fire balloons -- until I saw the one photo that came out.  Those wild orange swirls are the motions of the orange dots within the second it took to snap the photo. They are NOT the result of camera motion because 1) they are not at all the same, and 2) that bright green squiggle in the lower left is a string of Christmas tree lights across the street, and it's absolutely unblurred and crisp.  I've enhanced color and contrast to make the trails more visible but that's all.  The interesting thing is that my first UFO sighting was also of three glowing orbs and happened exactly two years to the minute on New Years 2016 -- which is why I had the camera ready, though I never expected to see them again.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Large flash of light in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible flare from an Iridium satellite?  PD));2018-06-02 23:15:00;5 seconds;Large flash of light in the sky At 11:15 pm, my husband asked me to go outside and watch the stars.  We were on the grass looking at the sky for about 10 minutes.  I was ready to come inside and go to bed.  I said to my husband, “I guess we’re not going to see any aliens tonight.”  At that moment and at the exact spot in the sky that I was looking at, a large light appeared and then disappeared.  It was as if a huge flashlight pointing straight at us turned on and then off again.   I was looking straight at it.  My husband was looking a little to his left and he saw it through his peripheral vision.  Almost instantaneous, we both said  “Did you see that?”   We were speechless the rest of the night and the next day all I could feel wash shock.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Above the Sandia Mountains low and east in the sky, I saw what appeared to be a shooting star traveling south to north.  But it didn’t change brightness, or size nor did it arc.  It was moving fast, much faster than a satellite, and had the brightness of a planet.  It made no sound.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Silent fast accelerating object above Albuquerque Sunport.;2018-12-14 23:30:00;10 seconds;Silent fast accelerating object above Albuquerque Sunport. The object was directly above Albuquerque Sunport.  I looked up at Orion’s Belt and I saw a large dim light.  Way to large, larger than brightest star visible. It was moving about as fast as a jet.  But slightly faster.  I told the other witness “look look look at this” and we looked up and the object accelerated fast but there was no noise.  The object moved unbelievably fast.  I mean we live near an air force base and see fighter jets all the time, even passenger jets, but this things moved about 5 times that.  What was most interesting is how fast it accelerated out of our sight.  The object was about as high as an airplane might be about five seconds before landing.  It made no noise.  Zero noise and it sped off incredibly fast.  I told my witness that it’s going to enter a fluff of clouds and we’re not going to see it emerge.  Which it didn’t. It flew towards the Air Force base but didn’t appear to land there.  It just flew off towards the mountains.  It was amazing,! actually.  We were not terrified, my witness and I were actually very excited.  I told my witness, if you watch the skies you can always pick an anomoly at least once or twice a year.  It was very disconcerting that it was so close above the airport, and nobody was able see it.  Maybe they did I don’t know.  None the less amazing.  We were standing near the grassy area north of the Sunport.  It’s the road all the taxis wait for flight arrivals by airport near the hotel and vacant lot at the end of the cul de sac.

Strange matrix-like lights traveled in front of the local Mountains, base to base, Smell of rotting flesh the closer I got.;2019-02-19 00:00:00;2 hours;Strange matrix-like lights traveled in front of the local Mountains, base to base, Smell of rotting flesh the closer I got. Let me start off by saying I am a firm believer that there is some weird ((deleted--stuff)) going on call it aliens or whatever but I'm a 19 year old native of Albuquerque, New Mexico, so I have heard the UFO stories of Roswell and other UFO stories that birth from New Mexico, but this one I was able to experience first-hand and up close. this was the scariest thing i have experienced but it has left me wondering if anyone else witnessed this. At about 11:00 p.m through 12:00 a.m February 19, 2019, (Just Last night) in Albuquerque I noticed a formation of three dots starting on the Northwest side of our Mountains (Sandia Mountains).  As I stared closer these dots were actually moving simultaneously south going along the base of the mountains.  These lights were the brightest lights in the city so I thought maybe a search party along the mountains or something with a logical explanation but the longer I stared the more intrigued I became at how they were just able to float and connect to each other in synchronicity, so I got in my truck and drove up Paseo Del Norte eastbound towards the Sandias where the lights were floating and slowly moving.  As I got closer to the lights they became almost mesmerizing and bear with me but seemed like an acid trip or some sort of hallucinogenic matrix within those light formations but the even weirder part is once I was at the street, Louisiana, still going up Paseo, it started to smell so foul almost like rotten eggs or rotting bodies, this was a clear indicator that whatever was up on those mountains was creating some sort of disgusting gas or odor which made me almost delusional and confused.  I immediately turned around and went home to get my brother so I could have a witness.  (My iPhone 6s could not pick up ((deleted--stuff)) on the camera).   After picking up my brother from the west-side of town, we drove to a small hill that overlooks the city and fair enough the lights were there and moving pretty close to were the Sandia Casino is and at that point I had enough and went home. There is a YouTube video:  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEHxfKn6dVo&list=LLp59OiX9hU9cvilK9Ckf3bw&t=0s&index=3)  The video shows 2 lights that are exactly like one of the many bright lights I saw last night. I'm glad I found this video since I was not able to get a video or a picture of the actual event.  Another statement to add was that these lights started on the north side of the bas! e of the mountain and 'floated' to the south side of the base of that mountain in such a strange manner, almost like the way programs can stack on top of each other on a computer.  Like if there is a virus spamming a bunch of programs on a computer.  It may be smart to add that there is a military base on the south side area where the UFO's were floating to (Kirtland Air-force Base, Manzano Base);35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

I saw a very, very bright light in the eastern sky above/behind mountain range. It lasted only seconds-it appeared then disappeared.;2019-10-09 06:45:00;Seconds;I saw a very, very bright light in the eastern sky above/behind mountain range. It lasted only seconds-it appeared then disappeared. October 9, 2019  This morning I was driving to an appointment I had at the VA Hospital in Albuquerque, NM.  My wife and I moved to Albuquerque late last year.  I saw a stationary, very, very bright white light above the Sandia Mountain range at approximately 6:45AM.  It was difficult to look directly at the light.  When I saw the light I was traveling east on the Paseo del Norte (an east west four lane highway).  The light lasted just a few seconds before it winked out.  I didn't see a tail that one would see if it were a meteor.  I can't say if the light was above the mountain range or east of the range.  At whatever distance it was at it appeared to be the size of a pin head.  I don't know if it was a UFO.   Currently, Albuquerque is celebrating the annual Balloon Fiesta.  The fiesta started last weekend and ends this weekend.  There were balloons in the sky but they were all above the Balloon Park or spread out to the north.  It was no more than 5-15 minutes after the light went out that I saw a helicopter flying south towards the general location of the light.  The helicopter may have turned east, but the distance was too far for me to be sure if it went east or turned west.  By then I was merging onto Interstate 25 going south to the VA hospital.  One thought that occurred to me at the time was that the light I observed was a star becoming a super nova.  A second thought was that it may have been an airplane coming in to land at the Albuquerque airport.  I scratched that idea by the way the light disappeared and its high intensity.  By the way, there were no stars to be seen in this part of the sky as the sun was up on the other side of the mountain range.  I'm sure other people driving east would have seen the same light.  There were hundreds of cars on the road heading to work or the balloon park.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

The lights were as bright as and the size of an average star and slowly traveled in a parabolic arc, from about 45 degrees above the horizon to approximately 70-80 degrees, equidistant from each other.  There were approximately 10-12 lights visibly moving and once they moved past the 80 degree mark, they gradually disappeared.  There was no sound and no flashing as with aircraft.  This event occurred with 3-4 groups of lights for about 10 minutes.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
UFO - Red light hovers over Sandia Mountain then at low it changes to two different colors and dissappears!!;2020-04-28 20:30:00;2 minutes;UFO - Red light hovers over Sandia Mountain then at low it changes to two different colors and dissappears!! I am an educated person who has obtained an Associate and Bachelor degrees of Science in fields where observation is important.  Like anyone I look up at the beautiful sky at night to see the Moon and Venus this time of year.  They are located in the western sky, the land down below is a flat plateau of lava flow remains from days past, from Albuquerque.  To the East, the Sandia Mountains which from view consists of rocky granite boulders to scattered pine and juniper forests and rises approximately 1 mile high above Albuquerque. To the East is where I am drawn at 830pm, finishing up some yard work, and the wind has calmed with sunset.  Between the houses, at a distance seems it is above the mountain I think, there is a Steady Red Light with a slight strobe effect to it.  I thought I saw a white light strobe behind the red light and then it is solid red again.  Let me give my location if you looked at a map of Albuquerque.  I am between Paseo Del Note and Academy St. and Ventura Blvd is one block to my east.  Well, it is probably the helicopter, I think, it is always flying around at night and making rounds.  No, wait, its a plane coming in from he East to fly over the mountain and it will move south.  Well, now I am interested, it appears now to be standing still and there is no sound all.  Now it is dark out, and it appears to me that it is way over the mountain at a great distance. I keep a steady stare at the object, now it slowly appears to be am object that is hovering above the mountain.  Only a slight, vibration made it appear to wobble maybe due to wind that is how I knew it was hovering.  I an see the top of the mountain and sky and then the Red Light.  One minute goes by and object slowly rises like a balloon a short distance up and stops.  It seems like it is observing something on the ground, which the houses completely cut off the lower half of the mountain view from my vantage point.Staring and curious, it rises very slowly a short distance again and stops.  What the heck is that?  No one around to see with me!  Ok, I will see what it does and that was 20 seconds of time. 1 minute 30 seconds, the Red Light, starts to descend down, I am going to lose it behind the mountain it seems, it gets to the top and lowers and the Red Light is still there!  It is in front of the mountain, not behind.  Much closer than I thought it was, but that is the foot hills.  There are houses and desert out there.  Are they making contact with someone?  And in that part of the foothills there are no street lights just houses out there.  I can see the Red Light lowering straight down steadily.  Dark mountain behind makes it clear to see.  No back and forth or pausing, just down. It goes down and I lose sight of it because of the houses.  Now that is all fine and sounds really interesting right?  I am not done. Ok, I have to get higher, how?  The place I am working has an above ground pool with a 10 foot scaffolding deck to jump into the pool, I run to the ladder about 6 feet from my location and climb, swing door in and move to the location I had seen it lower but now I am higher about 10 feet.  I move back and forth looking to see if I can get sight of it. Then I did.  I see the light, but it is white!  Iit has moved to my left as if it traveled a shirt distance, the light is moving up, the light goes out!  Staring the light turns green, rising then it completely goes out as it was rising.  After that either is was in a spectrum now that was invisible to my sight or it moved out fast, but it was cloaked from then on.  I urgently tried to gain sight of it and it was getting late out, dark and the lower half of the mountain was not visible to me due to houses.  That was disappointing.  The whole sighting was very quick. Took at the max about 3 minutes. I decided to come and see if anyone else had made a report about it or saw something.  I have seen the helicopter and what is important is that you hear it before you see it.  It is loud.  There was no sound.  At my distance, and the canyon of the mountain behind it should of made an echo or sound, there was none.  An important note here is that the helicopter circles when observing areas and keeps moving, rarely to stop and hover, wind may be a factor here.  The lights and the way they changed were not of the normal craft seen in our skies in NM.  Never have a seen a Green light on the helicopter. Once again, sequence was red light then slight white strobe behind and then solid red,  lowers moves to the north at low altitude went from invisible to white while rising and invisible to green still rising and then gone.  I just want to add that when I first saw the red light,  I caught a slight glimpse of white dots to the north of the red light as if they were in relation to each other.  But that was a 2 second glimpse and then it was only the red light.  I omitted it from the factual observtion because I doubted what I saw.  Thank you. Thank you for your time.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Airborne pilot observed supersonic light/object.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from airline captain.  PD));2021-04-04 21:00:00;1-2 seconds;Airborne pilot observed supersonic light/object On the night of April 4, 2021 I was captain of a commercial passenger airline flight. A FAR part 121 airline flight from KTPA to KLAS. While in level cruise flight I happen to see an object out my left window south of our position slightly ahead of our 90* abeam point moving from left to right at what I believed to be supersonic speeds. The object appeared as a dim yellow/amber single point of dim light approximately 15* above the horizon and diverging slightly from our tract traveling in a westerly direction.  The light increased gradually in intensity slightly dimmed then increased again before fading out of view. I estimate I tracked the light visually for 1 to 2 seconds and approximately 10* of arc horizontally. I could not estimate it’s altitude however it appeared to be in straight level flight and diverging slightly from our track in a westerly direction. As the light faded away I observed what I would describe as visible atmospheric disturbances similar in appearance to the trail of a shooting star but emanating from the front of the object as though it was moving so fast that it heated the air ahead distorting the atmosphere like a bow wave but did not leave a tail. The light intensity I observed was much less in intensity then any shooting star that I’ve ever seen . The object/light did not streak across the sky at high velocities in the way that I’ve seen shooting stars behave, it was slower but obviously much faster then our Airbus 319. The object traveled at a steady rate in high speed level flight leading me to believe that it wasn’t a shooting star or another airliner.  I observed this object sometime after we past Albuquerque NM in route to Las Vegas NV at 36,000 feet on a moonless clear night approximately 1 to 1 1/2 hours prior to landing.  To my knowledge I was the only observer.  I recently became aware that there is a way to report such sightings and this sighting is the only truly unusual thing I’ve observed in my 20+ year career in aviation.  Sincerely,  Captain *** ATP Airbus pilot;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
