1970 Sighting over Kirtland Airforce base in New Mexico.;1970-12-05 20:00:00;a few min;1970 Sighting over Kirtland Airforce base in New Mexico. I wrote about an experiance I had with my firend earlier in Denver. I spoke to my mom about it and she reminded me of a story of when i was only six months old.  My Grandmother was driving, my father was in the passinger side and my mother was in the back seat with me. They were by Kirtland Air Force base late in the evening.  I was just a baby.  The surounding area was not built up yet, so most of it was field.  By the field there was this huge object.   My mom said it was one shape than it transformed into another, almost like a crown.  She said that they lights were moving down the side of it were brilliant and colorful and we still don't have any technology like htis.  She said that all three had gotten out of the car to look at this object.  She said it was huge.  The lights were very phospherious and then it was just gone. She tells me this same story all the time, but she is afraid to talk about it publicaly.  Especially because at the time my father was a military man.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

A black object that at first looked like a hot air balloon, then a 747, then roundish. It appeared black against the twilight blue sky.;1997-11-22 17:30:00;3 minutes;Summary : A black object that at first looked like a hot air balloon, then a 747, then roundish. It appeared black against the twilight blue sky. A faint sound like distant chopper sounds. I was looking at it with another co-worker and it came to a stop. Then it slowly grew smaller and was gone. But it wasn't moving. Almost like a cloaking device. I have never seen a UFO, and I personally think it's a bunch of BS, but this freaked me out. I have got to go, I'm at work.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Seven red orbs followed by two F15s.;2000-11-15 21:00:00;15;Seven red orbs followed by two F15s. It was November 2000 and I was stationed at Kirtland AFB, 512th SOS.  My family (wife and newborn) had just come back from the movie theatre.  I parked my POV in the duplex and prior to getting out of the POV I have always scanned the area (situational awareness).  I walked to the back door and something told me to look up, I saw 7 red orbs following each other.  Yes, this is Abq and hot air balloons are rampant but these were not balloons as it was around 2100 hrs.  The mountains are to my east and these red orbs were in southern direction.  The 7th and 6th orb simply faded out.  Orb #5 shot up into the sky to a much higher elevation.  Number 4 thru 1 were still in a southern direction but began to veer southeast.  All of the orbs seemed to be slow moving when from the west came two F-15s.  I could tell they were as their dual afterburners were blowing trying to play catch up.  These two 15s WERE NOT FROM KIRTLAND (as KAFB only had F-16s (single engine afterburners)). ! Number 4 disappeared, #3 turned south and shot faster.  These two F-15s were now following the last two remaining orbs and never caught up.  The remaining two orbs (#2 and #1) just a continuous exact same distance from the 15s.  I immediately went in and switched on the TV to see anything was being reported.  Nothing ever came up in the news.  Our birds (helicopters and fixed wing acft) never flew in a southeastern direction to include commercial acft.  Those two jets were scrambled from another base to catch these orbs as my sister unit (F-16 Tacos) are a reserve unit and no one would have been there to ready the acft.

very able to make out shape and colors.;2002-08-13 20:00:00;20:30pm;very able to make out shape and colors. The sighting took place at around 8:00pm on August 13,2002. My boyfriend and I where on the way to my house and saw a giant object which at first seemed to be a plan. As it got closer we reliezed it was to big to be a plan. It was like a matallic silver and sort of a triangular shape mixed with the shape of a dimond. At the piont of  the dimond part where two giant red lights, on top a white one, on the back where two giant whinte ones. It was around for about five minutes andd while observing it, it disappered into thin air then would reappear in the same spot. Then it seemed to follow us and just dissaperd. The sky was clear that night. With our windows rolled down we assumed we would be able to hear a noise. It had to be about 100 feet in the air and not a singal sound was herd. There was only one.It also apperaed to have the three windows which would take turns flashing in a sequence.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
In my car on Juan Tabo and Central Ave, at 12:45 I noticed an object flying from an auto car dealership and a silver object that looked;2004-01-22 12:45:00;15 minutes;In my car on Juan Tabo and Central Ave, at 12:45 I noticed an object flying from an auto car dealership and a silver object that looked like a round object that had the shape of two bolws one on top of the other and the same object connected to the first. Object was low enough to see it well and it was procceding Southeast at a low rate of speed towards the Sandia Mountains. Upon arriving at my destination about a mile away I looked for the object that was now about the size of a dime and noticed 3 other silver objects the size of the head of a pin west of the Sandias very high about two to three oclock from me. I watched these four objects for about five minutes and they continued due west. The first object was gaining altitude and was decreasing in size. Two of the highest silver objects dis-appeared out of site at about 10 oclock from my vantage point and the one I originaly spotted kept climbing and was about 11 oclock from my vantage point. The objects were heading west and higher at a goodly rate of speed. At about one oclock the third object dis-appeared from view at about 10 oclock from my vantage point. The original object kept climbing until it was out of my eyesight at about 11 oclock but further south than the other three dis-appeared.This was a bright shiny day here with visibility unlimited.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
A wedge formation of seven garden spade shaped craft.;2006-10-18 00:40:00;4 seconds;A wedge formation of seven garden spade shaped craft. Seven small car sized objects in a wedge formation flew across the sky, under the low hanging clouds, silently.   They took about 5 seconds to traverse from northern horizon to sothern horizon.  Shape of a hand garden spade and illuminated underside the same color as the orange clouds.   Direcly above the west side middle object broke formation and fell back and east to the rear of the center object in the wedge.   Then returned to formation. This manuver took less than a second. The fomation quivered with the manuver and was solid and unwavering before and after. I feel they are ours, remote control and saying Hi to Kirtland AFB with the little fly over of over half the population of New Mexico.

Crescent-shaped object observed;2006-11-18 22:50:00;approx 10 sec;Crescent-shaped object observed My wife and I were sitting on our patio at about 11:00 PM on 18 Nov 06 watching the skies for Leonid meteors.  I was looking nearly straight up when I saw an object entering my field of view from the north.   My first impression was that it looked like a parafoil, but a second later, it was clear that it was something else entirely and very strange. It was shaped like a deeply-bowed crescent with pointed tips, dimly illuminated by city lights, not obviously metallic, not glowing or showing lights.  I called it to my wife's attention and she saw it as it passed almost directly overhead going south.  There was no sound. The heading remained constant and in just a few seconds, it was lost in the darkness.  It crossed approximately 45 degrees in about five to ten seconds.  There was no way of determining its size or distance, but we both had the impression that it was relatively low, small, and fast. It did not seem to be a flock of birds or a single bird.  The shape was constant...no fluttering or wavering. It seemed like an artificial object.  It did not resemble any aircraft I'm familiar with.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Bright stationary circular object in high atmosphere in broad daylight gives way to five smaller moving crescents;2008-06-08 19:30:00;approx 10 min;Bright stationary circular object in high atmosphere in broad daylight gives way to five smaller moving crescents June 8, 2008. Approximately 7:30 PM -- While playing in the backyard with my children, my daughter called my attention to what she called the first star tonight -- she was excited because at this time of year it is still very light, with the sun well above the horizon -- essentially still daytime. I initially took it to be a star, located about 2 degrees NE of a crescent-shaped moon. The size seemed about right for a star, but I quickly realized that it was WAY too bright to be a star, as it was still daylight and no other stars were even faintly visible. I grabbed my binoculars to get a closer look. It appeared to be a circular object in the high atmosphere, with a dark spot in the center -- exactly what one might expect from a weather balloon with something suspended below it, such as a basket with equipment. And the brightness of the object seemed consistent with a balloon reflecting the sun. What was strange was that the object maintained it's position relative to the moon for about five minutes, which is not the behavior one would expect of a high-altitude weather balloon that is subject to strong air currents. After a few minutes of observation, the object simply disappeared in a blink. For a good minute I thought it was gone, but with more scoping with binoculars I saw five smaller points of light in the same vicinity. These were too small to be seen with the naked eye, and they were barely visible with binoculars. The mind tries to make sense of things. I speculated that a weather balloon could have exploded into smaller pieces. This time, unlike the initial round star object, these smaller points were crescent-shaped, and they drifted SW until they moved past the moon, growing more faint as they traveled. It occurred to me that a spherical object in the sky would reflect sunlight in the same way the moon did and assume a crescent shape. This suggests the smaller objects were spherical. This does not explain, however, why the initial star appeared perfectly round. Forgive me for a flight of fancy, but a flat, round shaped object -- such as a pie tin -- situated at just the right angle would reflect light across it's entire surface and appear round to an observer. I can't come up with an obvious explanation for what I observed. What I saw was certainly not an airplane. Very unlikely it was an exploding weather balloon (how could the intact balloon remain stationary while it's exploded parts drifted in the wind?). Puzzling indeed. One final observation. Seems like an odd coincidence. While observing the crescents in binoculars, a Southwest airline flying at what appeared to be a MUCH lower altitude passed right in between two of the crescent shapes. What are the odds that a commercial airline passes through the tiny window of observation -- relative to the rest of the sky -- visible through one's binoculars at just the right moment under any circumstances? Quite a coincidence. The entire sequence took roughly 10 minutes. Crescents faded from view within 10 seconds of the airline passing through my field of vision. Again, Helluva coincidence. Nevertheless, I really don't think the airline was related to the objects. Airline was low altitude (either landing or taking off from local airport), and the objects were really high.

Unknown shape  ( known sound );2008-10-19 02:00:00;about 5 seconds;Unknown shape  ( known sound ) I feel compelled to report this sighting, as it is constantly on my mind.  I am a very stable person and I keep second guessing myself. It was around 2:00AM and I awoke with a start.  I turned my head over and saw a ( approximately )  10 by 10 black square in my room.  It had bright little specks and it started to change shape moving very fast. It moved past my head and it had a whirring sound like a small face fan that is why I know that I really saw it. (because of the sound )  I quickly turned my head to see where it went, but it was gone. Has anyone else reported anything like this???   Thank You;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Three spheres of light connected in a club like shape, lower lights soft whitish, upper light yellowish orangish traveling silently.;2009-01-16 18:30:00;30 seconds;Three spheres of light connected in a club like shape, lower lights soft whitish, upper light yellowish orangish traveling silently. On 1/16/09 @ approximately 6:30 pm I was taking some trash outside and putting into the trash container. I then sensed movement. Looked directly up and saw three spheres of light sort of clustered together. The bottom two spheres were soft whitish in color. Not really a glowing. Different from any other aircraft that I have seen in the night. The third light/sphere was situated above the other two spheres sort of in a club like formation. The sphere was approximatly 1/3rd smaller than the other two directly below it. The light color was a faint yellowish maybe kind of orange light. Movement was silent and moderate, but detectible by my senses. The altitude I estimated at approximately 200 to 250 ft. With my past military experience I would say this craft traveling at this low altitude is undetectible by radar. this instantly raced through my mind. I dont know why. The total approximate view time was approximately 10 to 12 seconds. It seemed much longer. I did a post mock-up this morning. Positioning myself and timing approximate viewing time. Not more than twelve seconds. The craft was moving in a northeasterly direction. Speed was approximately 300 ft per second. While viewing. At approximatly the 7th second. [Estimated on my post mock-up also]. The two lower light spheres suddenly turned off. Leaving the third smaller faintish yellowish light sphere. Still travelling at the same rate but, getting fainter losing light and shape, then totaly vanishing. I was'nt scared or startled. Just marveled,concerned, and sort of disturbed. As I feel presently. Finally. I have experienced seeing moving lights on different occasions. I always figured they have to do with the nearby airport and airbase. My experience last night was real and vivad. Recordable. Thank you.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Blue/Green Glowing Figure 8 shape sighted in North East Albuquerque - followed by possible Military Aircraft;2009-08-04 20:57:00;2 minutes;Blue/Green Glowing Figure 8 shape sighted in North East Albuquerque - followed by possible Military Aircraft I was out walking my dogs with my wife and noticed a low flying air plane (cross streets are Union St NE and Eddy in Northeast Albuquerque) at 8:57 pm.  Height was under 1000 ft.  Plane possibly looked like a C-130 (it was getting dark so it is hard to tell exact aircraft).  The plane was flying north along the east side of the Sandia Mountains.  The reason I looked up is because I could hear the engines as it was pretty loud and low flying (planes do not typically fly this close to the ground as the airport / Kirtland AFB is about 15 miles to the south. After looking at the plane, noticed a weird object in front of the plane.  The plane appeared to be following or chasing the strange object.  What the object appeared as was a figure 8 pattern with flashing blue/green lights moving on the outside of the figure 8.  The figure 8 object actually looked like an 8 on its side.  I could not tell if the space between the outline of the figure 8 was solid as it was getting dark.  I could just notice the blue/green lights circling around the figure 8 pattern. I spent 12 years in the USAF and have been around aircraft for years.  I also work on Kirtland AFB and am familiar with flight characteristics and aircraft types.  The only thing that I would even guess this could be is an Osprey aircraft (which they have at Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque) due to the large propellers.  Unfortunately, I have never seen the propellers radiate a blue/green light in the strange pattern.  I would also not understand why it appeared to be followed by a C-130 size aircraft.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Blue/green Hoops in the sky in Albuquerque, New Mexico.;2010-11-21 10:00:00;six minutes;Blue/green Hoops in the sky in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I live along an air traffic lane, and it may have something to do with it. I was on my computer at about 10pm when My house started shaking,  So I ran outside to see if by chance, maybe a plain was having trouble with flight. No I did not see a plane.  But I did see two blueish/greenish hoops in the sky.  They were flying very low and were very hard to see.  They flew very slowly towards the mountains/east.  I tried taking video, but nothing was showing on my camera, so I tried taking photos...again nothing.   By this time I was frustrated.  My mother had seen all of this too, so I know I,am not crazy.  But, about 5 minutes later. two more crafts were flying by each-other and again, shaking my house.   I, am waiting to see them again.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Bright, quick flashes of light directly above my house in Albuquerque.;2014-03-05 00:45:00;5 seconds;Bright, quick flashes of light directly above my house in Albuquerque I was in my backyard, on the patio, and heard a hum, like an engine or generator starting up.   A couple of seconds later, about half of the yard became illuminated, without any sound, from a bright light directly overhead for maybe a second.   After that, a quicker flash of light illuminated a smaller area in the yard, again without sound, about twenty feet to the right of me, immediately followed by a even quicker flash of light.  The hum and flashes didn’t last longer than 5 seconds.   It was not a spotlight or the sweeping lights used to advertise a new nightclub opening.  No other houses or yards, as far as I can tell, were lit up.   The light was not far off in the distance it seemed like it was right above me.   I did not see any objects at any time.

We took the same route home we've taken for years...thrrough our residential area we spotted a strange red light.  We both kinda made a comment like, strange place for a new phone tower.   Well, as we got closer we realized the light was attached to a giant almost catchers mound shape object larger than the house.  It had one pulsating red light toward the bottom.  It was darker than the sky, and made no sound while hovering.  It was hovering directly over a home.  A home.  No sound, just hovering. Truly terrifying.

Aircraft shaped like a sine curve, with a green neon light tracing its edges.;2014-12-03 23:00:00;15 seconds;Aircraft shaped like a sine curve with a green neon light tracing its edges. Around 11:00pm on December 3, 2014, I was hanging out with a close friend and his girlfriend at a park on the east side of Albuquerque.  We were walking around the park and heard something that sounded like a mixture between a jet engine and a helicopter.  We all looked up and saw a fairly large, slow moving craft flying pretty low.  We can only describe the craft as a black object with the shape of a sine curve, or something like a pringle chip with upward arches as the wings.   Although the craft blended in with the sky, we could clearly see its shape due to a smooth, bright green, neon light tracing the edges in that exact shape.  The final detail was a large, orange, slow blinking light on the back of it. We were near my house and I was headed home a few minutes after the sighting and I told my mom about it because it had been heading in the direction of our neighbourhood.  She said that a few minutes before I had arrived she heard the exact same sound and that the noise had shaken the whole house.  She described the sound as a plane about to land right above our roof.  I have been doing research since last night on any aircraft with that sort of shape but have found nothing. ((ADDENDA/RESPONSES FROM WITNESS)) #1 Thanks for the quick response!  The only lights were the large orange one and the solid green light tracing the shape of the craft.  I am an art student fortunately, but don't have much experience drawing vehicles.  I will definitely do my best to include an image by this weekend if not tomorrow.  #2 Hello, This is basically what it looked like from our perspective with a neighborhood across the road and the faint outline of the mountains in the background.  It seemed to be less than 1 or 2 miles away and fairly low to the ground considering it shook our house.  Again I believe the craft was black because it blended in to the background but the green and orange lights were what we could see perfectly.  Not sure if it is some sort of military aircraft or anything but I couldn't find any sort of craft with that shape.   Thanks!   #3 Great! That's fine with me.  I don't have really any knowledge of planes or military aircraft but the three of us got a little freaked out and couldn't think of anything it could have been.

Skip/hop/dipping flying craft.  Reflective and bright white to completely clear (invisible).;2015-05-30 15:30:00;3-45 minutes;Skip/hop/dipping flying craft.  Reflective and bright white to completely clear (invisible). Saturday, May 30th, 2015,  	Just to start off…  It was a warm day with a clear blue sky.  I was sitting facing somewhat South?  The object was moving South-West. 	I went out to the backyard to have a smoke on the porch.  After lighting my cigarette, I was just looking out over the street and saw what I first thought was a strip of cloth floating down across the street.  After a few seconds of examination, as it was falling slowly (swaying), its appearance was as such really large, thin, kinda flimsy, kinda heavy, almost belt shaped, yellowish clear with burn marks on it, mica mineral-esque, kind of metallic?  But with cloth like properties.   Anyhow, I watched as it drifted downwards across the street and over the house next door.  My first thought was, “that was weird,” and then I began thinking, “Where the hell could that have come from anyway?  Where could that have fallen from?”  I considered the angle, and it appeared to be falling in a way that it was much too heavy to have been picked up by the wind at all (there was only a slight breeze), as it was just drifting downwards.  My next thought was, “well whatever, that is just weird.” 	  I then started looking at the clouds, a few seconds after seeing the weird metallic/mica/cloth/burnt thing.  Immediately catching my eye was an incredible bright object a ways off in the sky overhead.  My first thought was, “wow that’s a shiny plane.”  hah But it wasn’t shaped like a plane, and it immediately stopping reflecting light.  I thought I lost sight of it, but then it suddenly got extremely bright again.  To compare it to something, I’d have to say it was like just the bright spot on a mirror where it’s reflecting concentrated rays of light.  I didn’t think it was weird, as I thought it may just be a plane catching light at a certain angle while spinning or something.   Then as it continued forward (still suddenly really brightly reflecting then not being visible), I realized it wasn’t flying like a plane should fly either it was kind of dipping down and then back up, and then down, and back up, in the same pattern (you know how they animate planes in cartoons that suddenly run out of gas and putter down and back up kind of like that), but it was more skipping like a stone across the water.   So, now my brain is processing seeing a strange flying object that suddenly gets really bright and then invisible while skip-flying. It wasn’t like a plane diving down and back up. It was more like a wave riding, hopping motion.  Anyway, I immediately decided, “that can’t possibly be a plane, because it doesn’t look like a plane (doesn’t have much shape at all) it’s not spinning or twisting at all or doing anything in any way to reflect light so intensely in that very consistent pattern…” It couldn’t have been a balloon either, as there was no wind and it was moving quickly and everything else I have and will describe.  A balloon could not ascend and descend that quickly either, especially in that consistent pattern.   Its hopping/skipping/dipping pattern made me think of that of an extremely large bird with an extremely large wingspan the way that the b! ody of the bird would dip as it thrusts its wings up and then ! down, but a slightly extended duration at great speed.  For a split second, I thought it might even be a really large bird, because of that, but it obviously was not a bird.  Birds do not shimmer, or turn invisible, or flap without wings, and they aren’t larger than planes, and aren’t shaped like weird squashed oval triangles.  It did not have wings or any specific shape.  The object also made no noise at all, and it didn’t leave any contrails, despite its speed.  I forgot to mention that the craft had no lights on it, other than the reflected bright white, and it wasn’t any other color but clear and bright white light.  It didn’t have any appendages or anything either. The object wasn’t aflame or anything.  It was just really extremely bright white reflected light. After blinking my eyes a couple times for a second something odd happened.  The object was apparently so bright that when closing my eyes it created the spot that you get after looking directly at a bright light (even though it had only been a few seconds).  This gave me a good idea of the shape of the “craft” I suppose.  It was like a stretched oval, kind of like a squashed very rounded obtuse triangle.  The shape was hard to discern as it became so bright. The surface appeared pure white, which is I’m guessing because of the crafts reflective properties. I have no idea.  I watched this skipping bright then invisible object for a couple minutes until it got to a good distance away. It was moving much faster than a plane at the height that it appeared to be. Another thought I had while I thought it might be a plane, before I noticed everything about it, was that it wasn’t heading down! . The first couple of skip/dips I thought might be plausible for a plane in turbulence that was suddenly damaged (though the sky was clear and no wind), but the pattern was exactly the same every time and the vanishing + reflecting really bright without spinning obviously made it clear that it wasn’t a plane. There was also no smoke or anything. It didn’t have a plane shape, and it was a consistently skipping/dipping really bright then invisible non-descending object. I’m super guessing that it was maybe about 2-5 miles up in the air. This was so astoundingly different and unexplainable that I actually wanted to report it on the national UFO sighting website. It happened. I saw it. Something presumably fell off of it and landed a few houses away (which there is no way I’m going to knock on my neighbors door down the way and ask if they have the weird metallic mica mineral like material that fell near their house). Afterwards, as I snuffed my cigarette out in the dirt, I jus! t thought, “Whatever, like the other random weird things peopl! e see in the sky I’ll just ignore it and go about my day. Unexplained stuff happens sometimes and I’m not going to jump to conclusions or get all tin foil hat about it.” Anyway, I thought it was over, I was just going to ignore it and whatever. I went back inside and got on my desktop computer. After about 15 minutes….. Something happened. A loud BOOF shockwave like sonic boom sound and the house rattled. The power immediately went off. The pressure and the sound came from the direction that the unidentified skip/hop-flying bright then invisible thing was going. The power went out everywhere. 5 minutes after that there was another smaller pressure wave sound sonic boom-like thing from the same direction. It didn’t sound like an explosion. Both sounded like…. I don’t know.... BUFF or BOOF? Haha Like a massive highly pressurized air pocket the size of a few football fields burst a few miles away? It’s hard to explain. Some of these details may sound like a hot air balloon, but in no way could a hot air balloon do exactly what I saw, or be made of the material that came from it, or create the massive BOOF (that’s what I’m calling it now) and sh! ockwave that turns off electrical devices.  Everyone was outside asking one another if their power went out and whether they saw anything.  Everyone was looking around for smoke and checking all the transformers. None of them had blown. After about another 8-15 minutes, the power came back on of its own volition. The outage was reported to the local electric company and I checked their outage map. A couple thousand reported people in this area of the city were affected and a few stretching outwards from the direction of the BOOF. There were more concentrated outages closer to the direction of the wave. There aren’t any large transformers that power everyone around here in that direction that I know of. This was written within a few hours of them happening. The events transpired at some time between 3:20 pm and 5:50 pm. It is now 9:31 pm. The electricity company reports that the cause of the outage is unknown and still under investigation. All these unexplained concurrent events could just be highly unlikely coincidences. Murphy’s law, so whatever I guess? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Circular w/ pointed nose, bright, but sharply defined, large object at high rate of speed, traveling NNE over Sandia Crest.;2015-11-08 00:10:00;1 second;Circular w/ pointed nose, bright, but sharply defined, large object at high rate of speed, traveling NNE over Sandia Crest. One (1) bright bluefish-white, yet well defined object, entered my field of view.  It was at as traveling about 20° North, from where I was.  (As bright and about the size of Venus on a clear night)  It was in the eastern sky and crossed over the top of the Sandias, but at a high altitude.  It seemed to be ascending at a high angle, as well, although it was moving parallel to my angle of observation, so it was hard to discern the ascent angle, for sure.  It was accelerating quickly and traveling at least an order of magnitude faster than any missile, rocket, or aircraft I have seen before.  It was circular but with a slightly pointed tip (again hard to see from a distance and from my angle to the direction it was traveling) Frankly, it looked like it was cruising and then shot out of the atmosphere.  Humbling, inspiring, amazing!  A second similar sighting occurred just before sunrise that same morning. See second report.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Circular w/ pointed nose, bright, but sharply defined, large object, decelerating and descending over Sandia Crest, moving NNE.;2015-11-08 05:45:00;5-10 second;Circular w/pointed nose, bright, but sharply defined, large object, decelerating and descending over Sandia Crest, moving NNE. One (1) bright bluefish-white, yet well defined object, same as at 0:15, the same morning, moving much more slowly, and seeming to decelerate and descend over Sandia peek, moving approx NNE.  It was circular but with a slightly pointed tip (again hard to see from a distance and from my angle to the direction it was traveling)  It seemed to appear as though it migh have been landing on the eastern side of the mountain, but that was just my gut impression.   This object was visually identical to my previous sighting about 5 1/2 hours earlier.  See previous report (below?);35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Changing flame and morphing balloon.;2015-12-25 19:30:00;5 minutes;Changing flame and morphing balloon. Stopped at Lead/Vassar intersection to look at strange light that was changing from white to pink to orange, slowly but as if on fire.  The object flew directly overhead, but it was cloudy and visibility was not 100%.  The object seemed to burn off small embers: one directly overhead, many others as it flew away.  As it was directly overhead the shape of the object seemed to change rapidly...  As if it was amorphous and constantly fluctuating somehow - the closest thing I can compare it to is a hot air balloon inflating on the ground, but I've never seen a balloon do this motion in the air.  Eventually it drifted over Kirtland AFB and disintegrated into many small orbs which feel to the ground, and the light of the fire disappeared. The body of the craft was morphing rapidly,as if the structure was a plasma contained in a dark bag. also, hot air balloons are usually very loud when they blast their heaters...this craft made zero noise.  Dogs nearby barked when it was overhead as well. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

The object was moving extremely fast, west to east, when compared to a high-flying jet.  As the object passed directly overhead, a private jet with two green lights was observed to be travelling northwest above it.  The second person on the roof of the house, with less than perfect vision, observed more of a black chevron shaped object.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Around 1-2pm a jet black Angled object about 2500ft altitude, est. 200ft to 400ft long point to tip to point, drifted along West to Eas;2018-12-14 13:30:00;30 minutes;Around 1-2pm a jet black Angled object about 2500ft altitude, est. 200ft to 400ft long point to tip to point, drifted along West to East for about 30 minutes approximately following Lomas Blvd East near San Mateo, and made it to Juan Tabo before I lost it.  Very strange, and certainly not a weather balloon.  The way it was stalled in the sky was center angle up, and ends down.  If it had been filled with helium, it would have been inverted.  It also reflected light from the sun.  Did anyone else see this?;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Light Tan colored object flying past in clear night sky covered 60 miles in 6 seconds no sound;2019-09-21 00:01:00;10 seconds;Light Tan colored object flying past in clear night sky covered 60 miles in 6 seconds no sound Saturday morning at approx. 00:10 AM   It was a clear night just past midnight. Sitting outside facing East I looked up at a clear night sky and put my arm up to block the light from the parking lights to my left.  I was looking up for meteors and stars. All of a sudden out of East an object appeared out of the dark night that was not a light but a light tan colored hazy enshrouded object moving N to S with incredible speed and passed in front of me and out of site in a matter of 5 to 6 seconds.  It stayed on a horizontal path directly in front of me at approximate elevation of 2 to 4 miles.  I saw that it was not flat bottom, round or triangular but a very unusual shape with obvious edges and seemingly solid and unusual because I realized that it was emanating its own light and not being lit from light reflected from the ground.  Might have been from the heat of its speed through the atmosphere.  It emitted no sound nor had any lights. North from the direction that this object traveled is a valley elevation 5280 feet above sea level, to the NE of my .s a 11000 foot mountain the object described seemed to follow this valley N to S at approximately 13000 to 14000 feet;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

my porch is newly sealed;2020-10-05 20:57:00;25 seconds;my porch is newly sealed First I was distracted by 2 flashes to the WSW part of the sky.  As I turned, I saw two lights traveling in the same direction.  As they did, the light would pulse much slower than a blinking aircraft light. both lights made hard 120-degree turns quickly.  It seemed as though a light washed across a surface like a turning car's headlights across a wall.  After 10 seconds I saw four more of the same flashing/pulsing corner lights.  I could follow several as they were visible more than not.  They may have been dozens or a hundred miles away. This sighting lasted 20-30 seconds in all.  I sat and watched thirty minutes longer but saw nothing more.  I am an amateur astronomer and know my planets, satellites, and the ISS.  This was truly unexplainable to me.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
