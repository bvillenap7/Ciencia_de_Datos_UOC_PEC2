Vertical,white cigar shaped object, seperated into 3 white round spinning objects,  disappeared, and a gold, metallic object appeared, flying erradically westbound. In the far distance I also saw a gold metallic object. I witnessed this while looking at the sunset out of the window on the Amtrack train, heading west between the hours of 5:00 p.m.-5:30 p.m.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Albuquerque, New Mexico USA Object/Lights Night Sky July 24, 2009 21:31-21:51 PM;2009-07-24 21:30:00;Approximately 15 minutes;Albuquerque, New Mexico USA Object/Lights Night Sky July 24, 2009 21:31-21:51 PM On July 24, 2009 at approximately 21:31 PM in Albuquerque, New Mexico USA I was riding as a passenger moving at a speed of 35 M.P.H. in a vehicle driven by my girlfriend westbound on Central Avenue, formerly U.S. Route 66, in the Nob Hill district of Albuquerque. A large, lit cigar-shaped object was noticed by me moving at a slow velocity in a westward-slight northwest ward direction. The object, when first noticed at 21:31 PM was in a general position of 45 degrees above the southernmost horizon of Albuquerque and moved to a stationary position approximately 15 degrees above the western most horizon above Albuquerque’s Nine Mile Hill by 21:34 PM. At 21:33 PM, I placed a call to Albuquerque 9-1-1 to inquire if anybody else had reported this event also. At the intersection of Central and Carlisle NE, the object’s light dimmed slowly for approximately two seconds, then intensified greatly. While eyeing the object, we drove 1/4 mile southwest to a higher vantage point in the city at Lead and Amherst NE. My girlfriend and I parked and exited the vehicle to concentrate on the unfolding events. What appeared originally as a singular, intensifying object was “growing” into a crescent-shaped object with now two other, distinctive intensifying lights equaling now three, bright lights. At 21:36 PM, I placed a call to my boss who lives in far NE Heights section of Albuquerque with a view towards the west for his opinion on the events. He witnessed the object immediately with his naked eye and later with great detail via a telescope. The object appeared to be a structure hundreds of stories tall. As it was positioned stationary, the bottom light (which was what appeared to be the original cigar object)was approximately 15 degrees above the horizon in the sky. The top of the structure(what was the third light) was at the 25 degree mark above the horizon. The second light was at the 20 degree position between the two lights. Again, all three light were arced in a crescent shape, with the 25 degree light being the northernmost. The lit object/s was/were visible from my vantage point until 21:51 PM. From 21:36 PM to 21:51 PM. From 21:35 PM to 21:38 PM , smaller, ancillary objects/lights appeared to rotate and fly around the stationary three, main objects/lights. From 21:39 to 21:41 PM, a large, unlit structure (close in appearance to an Eiffel Tower like-shaped structure) appeared from the extreme top of third light located at the 25 degree mark above horizon. At 21:49 PM, I placed  a call to my parents home in Seattle, Washington to describe to them what was happening. At 21:50 PM, 25 degrees above the horizon light dimmed, but was still visible. At 21:50:30 PM, 20 degrees above the horizon light dimmed, but was still visible. At 21:51 PM, 15 degrees above the horizon light (and the original lit object)dimmed completely object and lights completely ceased from view on the horizon.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Five lights plusing over ABQ sky.;2013-11-28 19:50:00;7 minutes;Five lights plusing over ABQ sky. My aunt, mom and I were waiting for Target to open at 8 for black Friday.  We sat in the car waiting because it was freezing.  I happened to notice these lights and I pointed it out to my aunt and mom.  We all looked at the lights and then we noticed they all started slowly moving.  At first, we only noticed three little lights, but then after a while we noticed two more not as close.  All of these five lights seemed to be pulsing slowly, they would pulsate to a really bright light to a duller light.  The three lights seemed to be moving slowly in sync with each other.  They did not have a distinct shape but they seemed to move together towards the sky I did not believe it was a comet or an airplane.  Slowly they would pulse bright and then dimmer until one disappeared.  They all disappeared one right after another, one at a time.  This was less than five minutes and it seemed like they moved a far distance in the sky but they moved very slowly.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Saw a kite-life UFO floating through the sky on Christmas Eve.;2013-12-24 21:15:00;1 minute;Saw a kite-life UFO floating through the sky on Christmas Eve. My friend and I were driving tonight, and then we decided to look up into the sky to look at the beautiful Christmas Eve stars.  While gazing, we saw a formation of some sort that almost looked like a flying net/kite that had lights placed at each edge/corner.  The object floated across the dark sky and changed shape while it flowed, with corners of lights swaying in and out.  After about a minute, the object was too far for our view.  It was a very interesting experience. ((NUFORC Note:  We have changed the date of the sighting.  PD));35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
A bright, silent, shape changing ball of light was observed over Albuquerque and Sandia mountains. It was seen at dawn twice in a week.;2017-04-27 05:20:00;45 minutes;A bright, silent, shape changing ball of light was observed over Albuquerque and Sandia mountains. It was seen at dawn twice in a week. In the morning hours of 4-27-17, a silent slow moving ball of light was seen hovering over Albuquerque and Sandia Mountains.  This object changed shape multiple times, from a ball, to a diagonal formation, and even made a v pattern.  This was not a hot air balloon, passenger jet, police or military craft.  It was like a star but moved in an intelligent matter.  It would even disappear and reappear until the sun came out.  This same object was also seen again on 5-4-17 in the dawn hours.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
I noticed a strange metal shape hovering south east.  ((anonymous report));2018-02-17 13:45:00;20 minutes;2/17/18  Roughly 1:50 PM, I was leaving P.F. Chang’s, headed south on Pan American toward Jefferson St.  I planned to continue down to Montano.   When I got to the top of the ramp waiting at the light (corner of Jefferson and Pan American), I noticed a strange metal shape hovering south east.  It looked a bit pear shaped.  I turned left on Jefferson and drove toward it.  I was watching it in the sky for 15 minutes, not moving, just hovering as I continued to drive toward it trying to get a photo.  It was blinking, still hovering, and appeared to be changing shape.  It was not a helicopter, airplane, or balloon.  That was obvious since a helicopter was circling around  near I-40 in the south west distance.  I don’t know Albuquerque very well, so I was turning left and right all over trying to get closer.  I ended up on Indian School and parked in a church parking lot.  My crappy phone camera still couldn’t see what I was plainly seeing at that point.  It was a very odd shape.  If you have Microsoft Word (version 2007), go to insert a shape and under stars and banners the fist couple shapes is what I saw.  I don't know how else to describe this.  It was red and blinking…or maybe shimmering.  It seemed to be changing colors a bit. It was so strange.  Just hovering, not moving.  Others pulled over in the church parking lot.  I know they saw what I saw because we were parked all horizontal in the lot just staring at the sky.  I tried again to take a photo…so frustrating…nothing.  Looked like a speck of dust on my phone even though what I was looking at was large.  I decided to drive further and try to get even closer.  In doing so, I must have ended up under it because I lost it.  I watched this object for a total of 20 minutes while I drove.  It was broad daylight, sun shining, so I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.  I seriously hope someone got a photo of it.

The object hovered with several lights all around it, at least 30 lights. The lights seemed to change color. As soon as I grabbed my phone to take photos it started to fly forward slowly then disappeared very fast. It seemed that the object changed shape as it moved into a triangle.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
