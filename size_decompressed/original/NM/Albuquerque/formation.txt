Lights in formation, stopped, changed formation, then continued along their previous direction.;1977-07-15 22:00:00;less than 1 min.;Lights in formation, stopped, changed formation, then continued along their previous direction. Mid-July 1977 / 10p / clear skies I had just graduated from HS, sitting at a local, Neighborhood Park in the Northeast Heights of Albuquerque, NM.  I was contemplating my collegiate future, looking up at the clear, dark sky. I have since told this story many times since that night, and it never changes.  What I saw was both startling and intriguing.  These five lights (about the brightness of one of the brighter stars in the big dipper) appeared in the SE night sky, traveling North by Northeast.  They formed a straight line in relation to my view, but at 30 degrees from the horizon, equidistant apart, just less than the length of my thumb as I held it up to the sky.  I first saw them at about 3 o’clock to my far right.  Their speed was constant, until they all stopped at once, after traveling just over an arm’s length (elbow to fingertip) in only 3-5 seconds. I initially thought they were helicopters, but convinced myself they traveled too fast to be ‘copters. They must have stopped for 2-3 seconds, maintaining the straight line.   What happened next gave me goose bumps.  One by one, while still in that straight, diagonal line, they made crisp, sharp 90 degree turns, changing their alignment to a V-shape formation.  This occurred in about 5-7 seconds.  Once in a V-shape, they maintained stationary for another 3 seconds or so, then continued at their previous speed in the same North by Northeast direction.  I watched them for another few seconds until they were out of sight. I am now a respected engineer and still look to the sky, convinced UFO’s are real, with the only question being where are they from and who are they.  Perhaps us, from the future?  We used to ask about disclosure.  It already happened, and we never really noticed!  We’ve become pre-occupied with our own lives, and concerns about such things as COVID-19.   UFO news is no longer intriguing or curious.  Most people acknowledge their presence, but also inquire about contact.  Actual contact is the next logical step.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
14 lighted objects on a clear night in New Mexico.;1989-06-20 22:45:00;less than 10 minutes;14 lighted objects on a clear night in New Mexico. I was 15 at the time of this sighting.  I was camping on a high elevation, on the top a rocky and treeless overlook, in a family tent with 4 other family members. They were all asleep. I was lying on my camp cot inside the tent.  My point of view was initially flat on my back, looking out of a very clear, new and clean net window.  Since I was on my back, what I saw at first was upside down. I saw lights at first, which ordinarily wouldn't have interested me, except that these were arranged in a small tight circle, and were spinning very fast, rising into the sky sharply with out sound, stopping and dropping suddenly.  I rolled over, sat up, and looked out of the window. There was no cloud coverage, no known or readily identifiable lights present other than the ones I a describing as unusual.   The best way I can give a familiar visual of what I saw is to compare each lighted object as shaped exactly like the cereal called Honeycomb Cereal but with lights where the holes are.  Each object would enter my line of sight from the lower left corner, from an area hidden by a ridge in the foreground.  Each one would shoot rapidly into the sky from the lower left area, diagonally across to the upper right, stop, spin rapidly for seconds, and fall faster than it ascended, and all in silence.   Each one was followed by another, in rapid succession, by other objects of the s! ame shape and lights, however some were smaller in diameter.  Each object was circular, but like the cereal, I could tell at the moment  that they would pause before dropping, that there were lights on the sides which spun around the object.   These lights were oval, not round.  The lights underneath, about three per object, were round.   All the lights were white, they did not blink.  The round lights were starionary and moved with the object-attached.  The oval lights were also attached, but did not seem to be stationary.   There were 14 seperate objects.  I remember very well, because I took care to count each one as it appeared from behind the ridge. I cannot explain why I could not wake my family.  I couldnt stop staring at the sky.   I also couldnt speak because I tried. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Formation - White Triangle, String of Lights, and Large Red Glow;2001-12-02 18:45:00;45 min;Formation - White Triangle, String of Lights, and Large Red Glow SSE approximately one hand length above horizon at arms length One large white object - triangular in shape, followed by a string of very small single points of light in a very straight line, off to the right of last point of light a large red light. The entire formation points SSE toward the SE horizon The white object is dirty white, somewhat triangular, lowest in the formation. The single points of light look like stars but are in a very straight line. The red light is more diffuse and is off to the right of the main formation. The entire formation is stationary reletive to the starfield and relative to a house across the street from my viewpoint. I reported the sighting to the local news (all 3 networks) - as the formation has been stationary for almost an hour. Some news desks said it was the Russian rocket burning up - but that event happened a couple of days ago and does not resemble debris breaking up in the atmosphere. I will try to film or photgraph the formation. As I write this report, the formation is still in the sky.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
6-7 golden orbs in a V-formation like a flock of birds;2013-03-13 22:15:00;15-20 seconds;6-7 golden orbs in a V-formation like a flock of birds At first, I thought the formation of 6-7 golden lights was a flock of birds, but the sun had been down for a long time by this point, and the orbs were way too big and glowing to be birds.  Plus, it was super dark.  The V-formation was traveling towards the northeast, while I was facing north.  The group of lights looked about the size of 4 small moons, or one large harvest moon.   As the golden orbs traveled away, their triangular shape drifted into the distance until I could no longer see the objects.  A helicopter was in the area hovering around my house, one reason I had been looking up so much.  When I called  one of the news stations to report my UFO sighting, they said the helicopters were there because of a standoff, not because of what I had seen.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Disk and a small cluster of strange lights.;2013-06-10 22:30:00;5 minutes;A disk and a small cluster of strange lights. I was looking up at the night sky during a blackout, when I saw what appeared to be one disk-like shape in the sky along with a small cluster of other lights.  They were there for about 6 seconds (hardly enough time to tack a picture) and then they were gone, just disappeared in a streak of light that lingered for hardly one second.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Saw formation of a lot shape with bright orange lights hovering over Albuquerque  airport area.  All were little then faded.;2014-11-28 20:00:00;15-30 seconds;Saw formation of a lot shape with bright orange lights hovering over Albuquerque airport area.  All were little then faded to only lower craft near ground. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) It happened about 7:45pm Friday evening.  When walking outside, I looked south towards the southeast.  I am guessing the lights were past the airport and had a bright orange/ reddish to them.  Not blinking or strobing but a strong glow to them.  As all were lit the formation was a L-ish figure up high, with a count of thirteen glowing lights individually synced.  I called my Friend to hurry come look when they finally saw what I did the upper part was not lit and the lower five that were horizontal were.   It lasted for about 15-30 sec. I checked to see if the news or anything was reported the following day and nothing was there I just switched off my phone so I was not able to take a picture but looked up strange lights in the sky on google.  There were some similarities to the glowing orange/reddish light in Dallas, Texas. as what the description said.  Thank you ((initials deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Multiple blue metallic lights heading east in formation witnessed in clear weather.;2016-01-02 14:10:00;7 minutes;Multiple blue metallic lights heading east in formation witnessed in clear weather   Several blue lights, and one white light, flashing in a clear blue sky.  These several lights headed directly east in a floating manner.  The number of lights increased occasionally to a number of 18, with most of them being blue and at least two being white.   The color of the blue was on the periwinkle side of the blue spectrum and clearly metallic in nature.  No discernable formation but heading in the same direction and at the same speed.    Comparing high altitude jet planes crossing the sky at the same time, the objects appeared to be much higher above the earth.   Activity continued for approximately seven minutes.   Witness notes that the angle of the winter sun may have been providing clear, daytime observance of the objects, as they reflected back to the viewer.   No visible trail emitting from the objects.

V-shaped formation of multiple white lights over Albuquerque, NM;2019-10-30 12:30:00;1 minute;V-shaped formation of multiple white lights over Albuquerque, NM In Northeast Albuquerque, New Mexico, at approximately 12:30 am, October 28, 2019, I saw a v-shaped formation of white lights traveling west to east, south of the Sandia mountain range.  The lights were tightly but somewhat haphazardly in formation.  No solid or linking structure could be seen.  I was unable to hear engine sounds or see a blinking aircraft light.  I tried looking on the web to see if anything had been reported.  It did look similar to a report made of a sighting in Lubbock, TX on August 25, 1951.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

My granddaughter who is 8 ran inside my house and said”nana something crazy in the sky…  I jumped up and ran outside and my son pointed Southwest - three what I call orbs first they were like gold lights in a top triangle formation. They glowed looked like they hovering then they turned red , two faded and one looked like it moved and then disappeared.

I thought I was looking at Cassiopeia with its 'W' shape, then I released that it was a series of lights moving silently across the sky;2021-05-05 22:00:00;15 minutes;I thought I was looking at Cassiopeia with its 'W' shape, then I released that it was a series of lights moving silently across the sky in a straight line, but in a zig zag formation. There was a much brighter light, then two, that appeared to be flying up and down alongside the formation, almost as if they were escorting them. After a couple of minutes they suddenly disappeared, then about five minutes or so later, they suddenly re-appeared back in the spot where I initially saw them, taking the same path I'd watched them take a few minutes earlier. Same bright light, then two, and then they all disappeared exactly the same as the first time. It was as if somebody was replaying it again.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
