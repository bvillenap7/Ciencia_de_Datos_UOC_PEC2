Green Fireball Sighted Near Albuquerque Moving Directly Up From the Ground;1998-07-15 01:30:00;1-2 minutes;Green Fireball Sighted Near Albuquerque Moving Directly Up From the Ground Around July of 1998 my wife and I were driving from Bernalillo, a little suburb of Albuquerque on the way home from work. We had one car at the time, so she was picking me up, although I was driving. On the way we were enjoying the cool air with the windows down. The interstate we were on was essentially empty, only a few cars going by at that time of night ( this was about 1:30 in the morning). As we were driving she was looking out the window, and said “What the (expletive) is that?” When she said that, I looked out the passenger side window also. Because the road was so empty, I slowed the car down considerably so I could see what she was looking at. Coming directly up from the ground was a ball of green light. It looked somewhat like a roman candle, but this was far too big to be anything like that. It flew straight from a spot we could not see near the ground, straight up in the air before vanishing. It was very large and moving extremely fast. We were maybe 1000 to 1500 yards from it. The only thing in the vicinity is pueblo tribal land with some small livestock. Our first thought was, “shooting star”, except that it was an intensely bright green, and obviously meteors don’t move upwards from the ground. 	We both saw it very clearly, and it never changed colors or faded. It simply went up and disappeared, without ever making a sound. Since then, we recently saw another object just like this. This one was a little over a week ago now (4/23/06), and was moving downwards this time. However this time it went through a color change from dull yellow to bright green, then disappeared before it touched the ground. Between us we have seen a number of objects over the years, but this one was very odd. I have never seen anything this intensely green or bright before. I wanted to submit this report because these “green light” objects don’t seem too common, and it was a bit unnerving. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

This was seen as the sun rose in morning. The gas attendant saw it, and me a vacationer, after I left the motel. It was huge, and many people should of seen it. Its was red and white, and pulsed, as it went across the sky. It left a huge contrail as it passed and disapeared in the distance, traveling along a path of old hwy66 or 40. The main freeway out of Albuquerque New Mexico out of town. The contrail lasted for 1 hour before finally slowly dispating. The object seemed large. It was very early in the morning, but the sun was up over the horizon when the contrail disapeared.Many people must have seen it, but the gas station man saw the contrail. I listened to the radio but it was never mentioned. I heard later in a newsw paper, 3 days before the military had a test in the area.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
A red & green light streaked across the sky, south of Osuna, from East to West then dissappeared.;1999-04-22 22:50:00;4 seconds;A red & green light streaked across the sky, south of Osuna, from East to West then dissappeared. I work swing shift and often go out onto the patio for my breaks.  I often observe the sky.  This time I was looking to the south past our building (the patio is on the northwest corner of the building) and saw something streak across the sky.  I first noticed it when it was above the building, it streaked out into the open to the west of the building and dissappeared.  It moved and dissappeared like a meteor but it was red in front and green in back.  It was totally silent.  I don't know how far away it really was but our building is two stories high and the patio is aproximately 75feet deep.  I know it wasn't a plane, helicopter, or owl.  I'd think it was a shooting star except for the colors.  I knew it was something unusual so I noted the time.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
5 blue-white spheres w/bright, glowing trails, traveling slowly from south to north over Albuquerque, 9:20 pm, 12/01/01;2001-12-01 21:20:00;10 minutes;5 blue-white spheres w/bright, glowing trails, traveling slowly from south to north over Albuquerque, 9:20 pm, 12/01/01 My son(26) & I were driving on I-40, heading east down the hills into Albuquerque, N.M.  At approximately 9:20 pm (N.M. time) we observed a formation of 5 very bright spheres with long, arcing, glowing tails traveling slowly from south to north.  The first 3 were in a triangular formation and much brighter than the last 2, which were offset from each other.  The latter 2 abruptly disappeared, and the remaining ones continued to travel all accross the sky, disappearing behind the northern mountain range.  They were too slow to be meteorites, and we could see them very clearly.  My son is a physicist & amateur astronomer and I am a teacher & book illustrator.  Neither of us believe that aliens visit or walk among us!, but we could not explain what we saw.  We discussed all the possible explanations for our sighting and came to the conclusion that they moved too deliberately to be space junk or huge bright comets.  They were definitely not airplanes, as they had very bright, glowing trails that followed their arc of travel.  Occasionally they would flash with blue light.  They were the largest objects in the sky - impossible to ignore. ((NUFORC Note:  Probably space debris.  Please see other reports.  PD)) ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION)) Thanks for believing me!  I have since heard reports of Russian space debris entering our atmosphere (possible rocket casing) that correspond to the date & time I reported.  It was a fine thing to see!;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Vehicle out of southern sky thought to be shooting star hovers over city.;2008-10-11 22:20:00;2 minutes;Vehicle out of southern sky thought to be shooting star hovers over city. Returning home from a friends house I spotted what I thought was a shooting star coming out of the southern sky at the 11 o'clock position. I yelled at my sister Look a shooting star! We both watched for it burn off and skip out of the atmosphere however instead, it came in at a very fast rate of speed then slowed down dramatically as it approached the city and then tree top level. Onch it slowed down it made a sharp right then sharp left turn and then hovered above the city and the tree tops. The object appeared round with an orange color. It made an arch as it entered the atmosphere. There was only one vehicle noted. Neither my sister or myself had ever witnessed an event like this before and gave us a very uneasy feeling.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

A redish-orange sphere that appeared to glow or be on fire fell out of the sky towards the ground.;2014-04-12 21:00:00;4 seconds;A redish-orange sphere that appeared to glow or be on fire fell out of the sky towards the ground. Around 9:00 p.m., my mother and I were standing outside her house in Albuquerque, NM, facing south.  It was dark and somewhat cloudy outside.   We were looking upwards at an airplane in the sky and commenting on the fact that it seemed to be flying low and outside of the normal flight patterns we have seen.   As we were watching the plane, we both witness an object appear to fall from the sky.  The object was much further south than the plane, so we knew it was not at all associated with the plane.   The object was round and reddish-orange and appeared to either be glowing or on fire.  It was about the size of the moon, although it certainly wasn't the moon, which was overhead.   It fell from the clouds towards the ground.  A house across the street obstructed the view so we did not see it land.   The entire process took 3-4 seconds total.   My mother was so surprised she actually cursed.   Following the sighting we did not hear or see anything else for several minutes.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

14 pulsating fireballs over Albuquerque emitting strange sounds;2015-01-12 19:45:00;20 minutes;14 pulsating fireballs over Albuquerque emitting strange sounds 14 pulsating fireball UFO'S seen over Albuquerque on Jan 12th 2015.  They were spotted at 7:45 pm and were present for about 20 minutes.  They came from the south and headed northwesterly. They merged together at certain points, and seemed to just blend away into the night sky opposed to speeding up and flying away. We were able to get video footage, and noticed the distinct sounds of moving water and insects upon viewing, however, we were in Albuquerque proper where neither of those things were present.  I believe the sounds were emanating from the ships. I've been witness to quite a few sighting over the years, but never one so blatant. How no one else took notice, i don't know, but they were definitely noticeable, and not of this world.  That I know. I'd also like to mention that out of all the sightings I've been witness too, this is the first one where I had no sense of euphoria during or afterwards, was not compelled in anyway, and my phone didn't die or shut off, which is why I was able to obtain footage.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

4 fireballs seen in Albuquerque;2017-01-12 21:35:00;30 seconds;4 fireballs seen in Albuquerque It was about 9:35pm on 1/12/17.  I looked up and there were 3 red-orange circles floating-following each other.  No noise, no flashing, I say not of this world.  I ran back inside to get my tablet, mind you, just seconds passed.   I went back out and could only see the tail end of the fireballs-they were gone.  So I went back inside, a few seconds later I went back outside and saw another fireball, but it was gone so fast, it headed in the same direction as the others.   It was a clear night the moon was out.  Location was SE area of Albuquerque.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
My boyfriend and I observed a bright green (with some blue) fireball streaking across the S sky, traveling W.;2017-03-23 20:15:00;3-5 seconds;Driving south, sometime between 8:15-8:30 PM, March 23, 2017, (Wednesday) in southwest Albuquerque, my boyfriend and I observed a bright green (with some blue) fireball streaking across the sky traveling west.  It originally caught our eye as a bright falling star would, but once looking directly at it, was what appeared to be a bright green ball streaking across the sky.   During its travel, it momentarily was behind a cloud and once past the cloud, it was vivid again, until it disappeared.   It traveled like a falling star would, but seemed much closer to the earth, as if eventually it would impact ground somewhere.   It was quite beautiful.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
