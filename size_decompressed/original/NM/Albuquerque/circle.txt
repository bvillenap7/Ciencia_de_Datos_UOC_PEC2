The night when I saw the disk UFO!;1979-12-08 20:30:00;10-minutes;The night when I saw the disk UFO! We were leaving Albuquerque, New Mexico going up the highway at night, and as we were going I looked down to the city below and in the darkness there were some blinking lights between the city below and highway that we were on, and then we were going to stop for some coffee so we pulled off the highway we had to go under the freeway overpass to get to the other side where the coffee shop was ,and when we were coming out from underneath the freeway there it was drifting along that frontage road where the coffee shop was ,it had blinking lights going when we came out from underneath the overpass when it knew we was there the lights stop blinking and its stop drifting along, it stood still it just sat there no noise not even a window or anything for lights it was close enough to the streetlights that the lights reflected off of it! it looked like stainless steel!!  It was a stainless steel disk and I really thought it was going to zap us before we got out of there but it didn't, any other blinking lights that I saw in the darkness that's why I think there was two of them, about the size of a good-sized living room, since there was two of them they look like smaller ships from the mothership , and I knew our technology hadn't advance to that point, to stop in midair no no waste we just don't have anything like that and I'm sure I should have reported this a long time ago, but I just saw this report on TV talking about the UFO and I got a name so here I am telling my story, when you see something like that it's really hard for you to believe what you have just witnessed!!!   That's what I saw!!  And that's my story !!;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Bright white sphere traveled across Albuquerque sky;2004-07-31 19:35:00;3 minutes;Bright white sphere traveled across Albuquerque sky I noticed a bright white light that never changed brightness, traveling in straight line across Albuquerque evening sky, while in my backyard with friends. Best guess is it traveled from the west to southeast almost right over Albuquerque airport, speed approximatly 400-500 MPH, elevation 25,000-30,000 feet, skattered clouds. I've seen many objects in the sky but none like this bright white light. As it progressed across the sky it did pass under an airliner which was at about 40,000 feet heading southwest with visable colision lights, unlike the white light. After the light passed the eastern mountains of Albuquerque the light just dissappered. No pictures or video. I'm in the USAF with lots of aircraft identification experience.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
White circular object rising straight up faster than balloon.;2004-08-31 16:10:00;60 sec;White circular object rising straight up faster than balloon. Looking east and up about 30 degrees from horozontal, noticed round white object.  Said to wife that a childs balloon got away, but it held my attention and I didn't know why at first.  It was rising beneath a mammatus cloud formation and the wind was blowing 20 to 30 mph.  At first it looked like a solid white balloon that had been released from a nearby shopping center seconds earlier like an 18 balloon that was maybe 150 feet up.  As I and my wife watched we both said that it was no balloon of any kind because it was rising straight up with no sideways movement at all.  Second, it was moving way too fast to be a helium balloon.  It was at this point that I had the impression that the object wasn't as close to me as I first thought.  It continued to rise in a non-swirling uninterrupted manner until it was about 80 to 85 degrees over head from horizontal.  I had been viewing this through an open window of a car to this point.  I looked down to open the door and get out to continue viewing.  When I looked back up I no longer saw it beneath the dark clouds where I expected to find it once more. Instead, I saw a black dot moving in a northerly direction at 90 degrees to the direction the white object was moving in seconds before. My wife asked where it was and I took my eyes off of it to glance at her and when I looked back at the sky it was gone.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

I was sitting in the parking lot ready to go into work, with my moon roof open, when I saw what appeared to be a shooting star traveling NNW at perhaps 1000 ft altitude. It was a dim orange orb. It did not dissapear after a second or so, like a shooting star. It remained visible traveling at a high rate of speed (3000mph) and over central Albuquerque began a sweeping curve to the west. The curve continued until it was traveling WSW until it traveled out of sight. I might point out that when I first saw it, it came right over the Kirtland AFB. The object's light emission never varied, staying a dim orange the entire 10 seconds of the episode. I could not discern the size of the object, but a guess would be that it was no more than a 30 feet sphere.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
UFO sighted on southern boulevard , on the west mesa in albuquerque.;2007-03-06 20:00:00;15 minutes;UFO sighted on southern boulevard , on the west mesa in albuquerque. On the above mentioned time and date, myself and two others were on the west mesa area, hunting on the public land. At 20:00 hrs. we noticed a single spherical light, just on top of a hill just west of us by about 150 yds. At first we dismissed as being something or somebody wandering around. Then we noticed the object , about the size of a car, hovering above the hilltop about 6 feet off the ground. Immediately following this observation, we noticed two more of same lights duplicating the same pattern of movement, about 10 yards from each other. We then decided to not stick around, and headed the other way, when we noticed the first light we saw coming over the hill and proceeded to follow us. this light hovered above the ground and to my left not even above or on the dirt road. This object began to gain on us, until i was going 50 mph. then it just disappeared. At which time we saw another object hovering about 200 feet off the ground and about 200 yards away. Then it immediately disappeared. No aircraft noise , gradual or sudden increase in speed, and definately not any type of aircraft we were familiar with. At this point being pretty shook up, we headed home in rather hurried fashion, when we noticed the same type of lights hovering over the crest of the sandia mountains, and disappearing as well.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Beige object west of Sandia Crest, Albuquerque, NM;2007-05-26 23:58:00;0;Beige object west of Sandia Crest, Albuquerque, NM I am a 40 year old male, former biochemist and practicing securities lawyer. I am submitting a photo that was taken by me at the end of Pino Trail near the top of Sandia Mountain at 1:58pm on May 26th.  I did not witness the object at the time the photograph was taken. Zoom in on the object that appears above the clouds.  I was alone and at least 4 miles few miles away from civilization.  No other hikers were in the area - so rock throwing is unlikely. A second photo taken within 10 seconds of the attached pic and shows nothing (although it doesn't show exactly the same portion of the sky, it does capture the area where this object is located).   I can send photo nos. 6199 and 6201 and others taken at the spot within minutes of photo no. 6200 if you have any interest.

Lasting approximately 10 to 20 seconds.   Running inside to get friend immediately returning back outside and running toward street I, a friend and third person witnessed directly above our heads an extremely bright round circular light.  Altitude unknown, silent, single bright white light.   Light remained solid for twenty seconds and then closed down like camera lens to a pinpoint size greyish colored dot.  I continued to observe the grey dot as it paused after closing down, then very slowly floated northeast gaining slight altitude moving toward mountain.  It paused for short period, then continued slightly changing direction moving direction where blue meteorite had landed in Sandia Mountain.  I watched the grey dot slowly float northeast/north until it was out of site possibly over the Placitas area.   The meteorite appeared to have landed north of tram area behind the first mountain range.  I stayed outside for awhile waiting or hoping for another sighting.  I also reported to MUFON shortly after sighting... maybe Jan 2008.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Yellow ball accelerates rapidly from a standstill over Albuquerque Int'l Airport;2011-12-27 05:25:00;5 seconds;Yellow ball accelerates rapidly from a standstill over Albuquerque Int'l Airport Saw what I thought was a bright star in the eastern sky about 10-12 miles from the airport above the Manzano mountains. The glowing ball of yellow-white light was stationary for about 3-4 seconds then, it suddenly accelerated moving West to East over the mountain range.  Acceleration was very rapid and the object appeared to wink out at the end of sighting. This was not a comet or meteor entering the atmosphere.  The object was stationary for at least a few seconds before the rapid acceleration over the mountain range and it did have a tail or a trail behind it.  The object also was not a plane or a helicopter as it had no blinking lights, just solid lights, and the acceleration was incredibly fast from a stationary position, I would say several thousand miles per hour if I had to guess.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Witnesses then turned east on I-40 and searched to the rear of the vehicle to continue observing military aircraft.

Large washer shaped object rotating of Kirtland AFB.;2013-06-20 12:00:00;several minutes;Large washer shaped object rotating of Kirtland AFB. About five years ago in Albuquerque, NM, my brother who has since passed on, was very excited to tell me about what he and some other people saw. He was working in an animal clinic when several customers entered the waiting room very excited from the parking lot outside.  They wanted someone to come outside to look at a strange thing up in the sky.  So he went outside with them and saw this thing hovering over Kirtland AFB which was about six miles away. He said it was round and thin with a hole in the middle of it like a giant washer.  It was slowly rotating on its edge.  The sun was reflecting off of it as it rotated. They watched it until it disappeared behind a cloud and was gone. I do not recall him saying how long they watched it or what color it was. Duration time, date, and time of sighting are a guess I put on the form as this was years ago. He was too excited about seeing the thing and did not mention those things. He has passed away since.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

It looks like a star at first glance but you can see that it has some kind of wings.  It is perfectly round, like a classroom globe but shiny and with blue-ish wings, the rest is white or extremely shiny silver color. This was seen in the sky at 19:45-ish right now 19 September 2013.

Numerous blue white shimmering spheres moving rapidly from northwest to southeast over Albuquerque.;2013-10-04 20:00:00;10 minutes;numerous blue white shimmering spheres moving rapidly from northwest to southeast over Albuquerque At approximately 17:40, while driving home along Unser Blvd NW, I observed a bright, but strangely short meteor enter to the northwest.  Impressed by how vivid this fireball was, I shortly put it out of my mind. At around 20:00 I had stepped outside of my westside Albuquerque home to have a cigarette and load items into the car for a weekend trip to Canjilon, NM.  Catching motion out of the corner of my eye, I glanced at the western sky and observed numerous shimmering balls of light crossing rapidly from northwest to southeast.  I promptly ran inside and called for my fiancee to step out as well in order that she could verify what I was observing.  I also retrieved my 60 power spotting scope.  She stepped out with me and we watched in amazement as these objects continued to stream across the sky.  Using my spotting scope, I was able to track one of these objects and was surprised to discover that the scope did not magnify it nearly as much as I would have expected.  I take this to mean that the objects were further away than my initial estimate.  The object I observed with the scope was circular, and while it appeared a bluish white to the naked eye, it seemed to be like a disco ba! ll-shimmering in many different colors.  I put the scope down and continued to observe with the naked eye until all of them had passed.  There was little if any noise from these objects aside from a faint muttering rumble.  Their movement was erratic and uncoordinated, with some of them traveling faster, and taking wavering paths, but all generally to the southeast.    They traveled very quickly-seemingly three times as fast as I would expect an aircraft to move at the same distance.  They  passed in three groups, with the majority of the objects comprising the lead group-almost reminiscent of the way race cars move about on a track.  I considered taking photographs or video, but considering the apparent size of the objects, their velocity, and the state of darkness at that time of night, video would have been inconclusive and photographs would have been nearly impossible.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

I live very close to the airport and Kirtland AFB.  This was not an airplane, or helicopter, or satellite, but I thought it was interesting that a very loud helicopter followed the object.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Fast moving circular object approximately 20% the size of a full moon in area appreared over the Manzano Mountains SouthEast of Albuquerque.  The craft moved at an angle towards the ground, traveling west.   The object was about the altitude of a circling police helicopter traveling at about twice the speed of a cruising aircraft.  The object was traveling in a straight line at first, then about two seconds into the event, gained altitude suddenly reaching its initial altitude almost immediately.   The craft continued in the same direction at the same speed at the same angle towards the ground for another two seconds before disappearing into the clouds.   All through the event the clouds reflected the green color of the lights. event happened for four seconds;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Round reflective object in the sky over Albuquerque, NM.  ((anonymous report));2018-08-25 14:00:00;>20 minutes;Round reflective object in the sky over Albuquerque, NM. On August 25th, 2018, at around 2 PM Mountain Time I observed an object in the sky over NE Albuquerque.  The object appeared to be silver reflective or translucent and round in shape.  It was very still in the sky despite wind gusts of 10 to 15 miles per hour from the south.  I noticed the object was at a higher altitude than the clouds, so I would guess it was sitting at about 15,000 to 17,000 feet.   I grabbed my digital camera and took video and photographs of the object and I also observed it through a small portable telescope.  I was unable to identify exactly what it was.
