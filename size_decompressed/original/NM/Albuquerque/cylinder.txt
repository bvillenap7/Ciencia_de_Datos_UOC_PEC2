I look up at the NNE sky and noticed that there was an object in the sky.  It was at about a 60 degree angle and kind of floating from an ESE direction.   After about a minute, it changed, slightly, to a NNW direction.  Within a 20 to 30 second period, it slowly shrank in size and then vanished.    The object was cylinder/cigar shaped, white in color except for dark color (looked black) in the middle of the object. I saw no wings or any windows.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
ROCKET WITH LONG THIN WINGS;2011-10-25 11:00:00;15 sec;ROCKET WITH LONG THIN WINGS it was silver. it looked like a rocket but it only had 1 tail fin. the body was at least twice as long as a commercial airliner. it was at about 10,000 ft. it was not going up.  It was going horizontal.  It started a slow right turn.  That's when i saw the wings. the wings reminded me of the U2 but these wings looked longer and thinner.  It also had smaller tail wings.  It made no sound and left no trail. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Two dimmed lights traveling at insanely high speeds with no noise.;2012-03-11 23:00:00;12 seconds;Two dimmed lights traveling at insanely high speeds with no noise. It was me and my three other friends plating a game of late night basketball at a middle school court we took a break and one of my friends said what the hell is that?! and me and another one of my friends looked really quickly but our fourth friend did not see it.   That UFO we saw was shaped like a cylinder but sideway it had two bright lights that dimmed right before the craft sped off at speeds I didn't think were possible there also was no noise at all the craft appeared really far.   I have never been so thoroughly convinced there was aliens in existence before tonight.   Please take my sighting seriously.  ((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.

Single orangish rectangle with rounded corners, no blinking. Took a smooth route and was very fast, and would decrease speed. Vanished;2012-12-21 21:30:00;5 minutes;Single orangish rectangle with rounded corners, no blinking. Took a smooth route and was very fast, and would decrease speed. Vanished I just witnessed an unidentified object approximately 1 hour ago.  I went out to get my car to get my ipod, and by chance witnessed the object out of the corner of my eye. The object was very bright orange, but not just solid orange, but kind of a firey contrast, I don't know how to explain it. It was similar the a thick cigar, but not as long, maybe half as long. This object had no noise! The object left no trail of smoke, and the object did NOT have any blinking lights whatsoever. I'm so shocked and kind of scared as I write this I have never witnessed anything so horrifyingly real that i can recall. the object sped up a little bit, and then gradually decreased speed almost unnoticably if you didn't continually look at and study the object...it kept speeding up and gradually slowing down, and repeating this but not in a perfect sequence.  It was going straight somewhat and I anticipated it to go straight past my house but it shiftet direction and veered rig! ht not at a right angle but kind of circular. As i figured it would keep going, it STOPPED.  Almost right above my house but very high in the sky, higher than an airplane or helpicopter. lIKE a period on a piece of paper, id didn't move. It was bright and there was no flickering light or lights like on an airplane or helpicopter. It stayed stationary approximately 1 minute. I was frozen and shocked, and it VANISHED. God, it just disappeared. I made sure to look in that area and all around. There was no silohette or shadow or dark object. this thing disappeared quicker than a candle light being blown out. I called my friend to reveal what i had just seen, i am so dumbfounded and in shock. I was shaking as I told her. I just want to know if anybody has ever seen this, i'm lost for words. I know for fact this was a ufo spaceship of some sort. The night sky was very clear, THERE WERE NO OTHER AIR CRAFT IN THE AREA, there were no jet smoke streams in the air and the night was sil! ent, completely silent. I am at lost for words and am positive! that I saw some sort of alien spacecraft. Would like to hear of any similar sighting on thw 21!;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Large bright cylindical UFO observed for 15 min.   ((NUFORC Note:  Helium-filled balloon at high altitude.  PD));2013-09-21 19:00:00;15 minutes;Large bright cylindical UFO observed for 15 min. At approximately 1900 on 21 Sept 2013 I witnessed a very bright object in the sky and observed the object for 15 min, while on the University of New Mexico campus in Albuquerque, NM. I was at the student union (SUB) earlier and then I had an urge to go outside and look towards the east (Sandia Mountains).  It was approximately 1900 and the sun was setting.  The sky conditions were clear with no cloud cover in any direction northeast to southeast.  There was a flock of common house finches in the tree with a flurry of chirping at this time.  I had an urge to look towards the east and saw an extremely noticeable bright object in the sky.  The object was approximately 13-15 degrees in the sky and was bright white.  It was also in the form of a cylinder about so, I first though it was Comet ISON.  Of course that was ruled out as it is scheduled to pass in Nov, and then I ruled out aircraft types, and balloons.  The object remained in the same spot on the sky for the ent! ire duration of 15 min.  The object was as bright as a sewing pin head held at arm’s length for the duration.  It seemed to be above the traffic departure pattern at the airport, estimated at 15000’.  Aircraft traffic taking off towards the east did not seem to be near it vertically or horizontally however, I can bet radar would have picked the object up. The object also seemed to be friendly and there were times during the duration I saw other smaller white objects around it for less than a second. When I asked if they could change colour they did at the time period of 12-15 min. The object became more circular and changed from bright white to red orange to red then faded out to look like a very dim white star. I did not observe the object after 15 min. I normally do not make reports unless the object is a bit more significant in scale/size/colour/duration although I see objects usually once a week or more. I also have an extensive military aircraft background and have seen! objects of significance while on missions. Lastly, I want to ! give my sincere thanks to you for providing this service and thankful you are also featured on coast to coast often!;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
