We looked at the sky and saw a flying craft that looked like a spinning top or a cone with different colored rings spinning around it.  The rings were red and yellow.  It hovered in one spot far away in the horizon toward Arizona.  We could not believe what we were seeing. We saw it in the sky hovering and I thought maybe it was a helicopter.  No Way!  The way it was moving no craft that we know of or have seen moved like this UFO.  I got to take pictures of it with my phone.  There was a moment where it stopped hovering and went forward then again continued hovering until we reached Belen.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
