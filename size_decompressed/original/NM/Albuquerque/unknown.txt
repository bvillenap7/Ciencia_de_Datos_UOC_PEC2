I am ((deleted--aviation specialist)) in Albuquerqe NM.  I was driving east on the north side of the city when I noticed a vert bright light begin in my rear view mirror and travel NE until the whole sky was lit up for about 1 second.  My first thought was that it was as bright as nearby nuclear explosion would be.  It began in the West or Southwest sky and traveled to the East or Northeast.  No sound was associated with light.

After the wedding is of course a reception.  The reception was at a country club just north of the city.  People were talking and having a good time but i needed a break so I went outside to look at the stars, something very hard to do in Houston.  While I was looking a bright green light, looked like a point of a laser in the sky.  It made a quick half circle and then was gone.  Very fast and very spooky. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Stationary object over New Mexico;2003-08-10 19:00:00;100 minutes;Stationary object over New Mexico While passing the football to my son and a couple of his friends, I looked up in broad daylight, and saw an object in the southwestern sky that was glowing extremely brightly. It was way off. I was on the east side of Albuquerque, and this thing looked to be to the extreme west, southwest end of Albuquerque, or even possibly a little farther out over the mountains. It was maybe 10,000 feet up. I regularly observe Venus, and Mars, and know exactly what both look like, and where to find them in the sky. This object was way brighter than Venus, or any star, and it was still broad daylight. I stopped passing the ball and just stared at it. One of the kids (ab out 10 years old) asked what I was looking at, and I said I didn't know. The kid laughed and said it was a UFO. I ruled out a Hot Air Baloon, Venus, a helicopter, and it obviously wasn't a plane because this object hovered there for more than an hour and a half. I should note that it's position in reference to Earth never changed. During this 100 minutes, any celestial object would have disappeared over the horizon, but this one remained at the same relative position over the horizon the whole time. After we finished playing catch, me and my son drove down to Target, still watching this object hovering in the same spot. By this time I was fairly sure it was a UFO. Now here's how I know this wasn't venus, because if you do your homework, you'll probably conclude that I was looking at Venus, especially as bright as it is right now, but this was August of 2003. Venus wasn't unusually bright then, like it is now. This is how I judged how far off and how high it was. Because as the Sun went down over the western horizon, and the western sky turned red, this object also went from glowing a bright white, to turning red as the sky turned red. And when the sky went from red to dark, the object went from reddish, to disappearing in the darkness. So my conclusion is that it was in fact not Venus, it was in the atmosphere, it turned red as the sunl! ight weakened, and disappeared in the dark because it's glow was actually the sunlight reflecting off of it. I should also note that about a month later, someone sent George Noory a photo of a UFO over arizona within a month of my sighting, and it looked like the same thing I had seen. So two similar sightings within a month, one in New Mexico, and one in Arizona. The other thing I found totally suspicious was that this thing had to be on Kirtland Air Force Base's radar. It was within a few miles of the base, but no aircraft ever approached it the whole time it was there. I should also note that it hovered not to far from where air traffic comes in to the Albuquerque Sunport. However, I never saw any commercial flights coming in in that vicinity all during the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  We wonder whether the witness might have observed one of the helium-filled, high-altitude balloons that are launched out of New Mexico, from time to time.  PD));35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
The object's lights were different and its rapid gyrations were most violent to be a normal aircraft.;2004-08-30 21:45:00;3 minutes;The object's lights were different and its rapid gyrations were most violent to be a normal aircraft. This sighting occured 21 miles west of the I-25/I-40 interchange and 1 mile north of I-40 near Albuquerque, New Mexico in the Rio Puerco Valley.  I was looking North out my bedroom window and saw an unusual light heading toward our ranch house.  I retrieved my field glasses and observed a set of red, white, and blue blinking lights. The aircraft was traveling slowly from north to south and was at a 30 degree angle from where I was standing. I went outside with the field glasses and focused on the object.  The aircraft was closer now, but I could only see the lights, not the aircraft.  The lights began to blink and blink twice the rate of aircraft strobe lights.  I lowered the binoculars and watched the aircraft begin to dart about much the way a hummingbird would. This activity went on for several minutes.  The shape of the craft was not distinguishable.  The rapid gyrations were covering about 10 degrees of sweep right to left, left to right and up and down.  I hurried into the house and asked my wife to check out this object in the sky.  When we went outside the object was gone.  There were thin clouds near where I last saw the object.  The total time of observation was approx. 3 minutes. The moon was nearly full and very bright.  I am a EAA Ultrlight instructor.  My wife and I own a Powered Paraglider School which we operate from ranch.  I am also a licensed General Contractor.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
A brightly flashing object was seen in broad daylight.  It rose suddenly, hovered, then dived and sped away.;2005-06-19 12:50:00;about 5 min;A brightly flashing object was seen in broad daylight.  It rose suddenly, hovered, then dived and sped away. I noticed a flashing, silvery glint off in the west as I was driving home.   I thought it was a piece of trash in the air at first, but it had a very bright, metallic glint to it and it was holding altitude and moving along toward the south-southeast, dipping and climbing a little in a very odd manner.   I stopped and watched it  the flashing continued in an irregular, fluttery fashion, and it continued its southerly motion at a deliberate pace that seemed very much at odds with the wind at the time, which was calm at the surface.  After perhaps two minutes of observation, the object was due south of me  it suddenly rose very rapidly to a position probably 70 degrees above the horizon and stood motionless.   It continued to flash and I could see a black phase alternating between the bright ones.   There was no discernable shape and the size was just sufficient to give me the impression of angularity.  If you imagine a rectangular mirror of a few square feet of area, perhaps half a mile away, tumbling and twisting randomly, but hanging still in the air, that's what this thing reminded me of.  It seemed to be relatively close,  I would guess between a quarter and a half a mile, but probably not over a mile.  As it hung in the sky, flashing, I could occasionally see hints of color and there was occasionally a sense of a sort of fuzzy distortion immediately around the light.  It continued to hold in position for approximately a minute and then it suddenly dived down at a very rapid rate and then shot off horizontally just above the southeastern horizon, traveling roughly east-southeast.   It vanished behind some buildings and trees.   Surface winds were light and variable, with a breeze of perhaps one or two miles per hour.  Temperature was in the eighties, the time was a few minutes before one in the afternoon.  The sky was perfectly clear and visibility was on the order of eighty miles or better.  The only thing I can think of that might have behaved like this would be a small piece of aluminized mylar caught in a thermal.  But this object was moving a relatively high rate of speed for most of the time I was observing it  the winds present at the time cannot account for this motion.   The zoom to high altitude might have been caused by a thermal,   but the hover and very rapid descent to low altitude (around 100 feet) followed by a rapid translational motion is beyond anything I know that thermals are likely to do.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
3 UFOs seen in one weekend;2006-09-30 19:00:00;seconds;3 UFOs seen in one weekend I was standing outside at about 7:00 pm or so talking to a buddy when I saw something behind him. It was a light in the sky. It moved and changed directions extremely fast and then disappeared. I only saw it for a couple of seconds. The next morning I went outside to go get breakfast and looked in the sky to see a shiny object that appeared to be wobbling. It was hard to make out the shape but everytime it wobbled the sun would reflect off of it differently. It quickly disappeared while I was looking at it for about 1 minute. Later that day (the 1st of oct.) I was staring in the sky outside of my window when I saw airplane fly by. In the opposite direction of the plane was a ball moving through the sky. It was clearly a ball and I thought it was going to hit the plane but it didn't. It then disappeared out my vision from the window. When I went out side to take a look it was gone. I look out in the sky almost daily for UFO activity and know that Albuquerque doesn't have many spottings. I don't think it is a coincidence that I saw three here in that one weekend as well as many other people. I tried to get pictures but they didn't come out well.

I was in back yard smoking and looking into the south west sky. I didnt see it forum I dont think but i saw what i can only explaine as a white ball of light. It wasnt a plane or a star... It looked more like if you took a dozen stars and put them all together. Thats about the brightness and the size that it was. It moved slowly west about the same speed you would think a airplane to move. Then after about 12-15seconds of moveing it just started to fade away. The fadeing only took about 2-3seconds then it was gone. It didnt fade because it was getting farther away. It went from being the full brightness that i saw from the first second to just fadeing in about 2-3seconds. Then it was gone and nothing happened after. I am in a city whee i can look into the spy for 10mins and watch 15 airplanes fly by. I know what they look like how they sounds. Flashing lights etc. THIS was not a aircraft. This was a light just like a star but many times brighter...That moved west to east about 12-15seconds then just fadeds(not dsapear) it faded from bright to nothing within 2-3seconds.

Two Exhaust Port white lights streaking across the sky in Albuquerque that instantly vanished.;2008-10-05 21:18:00;2-3 seconds;Two Exhaust Port white lights streaking across the sky in Albuquerque that instantly vanished. Two white lights streaked across the sky from the East travelling West at the intersection of Coors and Central. Lights appeared to be exhaust ports, and were at the rear of craft.  There was a large building behind me, so I did not see the trajectory until the object was directly overhead.  At first, I thought it was a meteorite, but there were two lights spaced a small distance apart.  Also, Albuquerque has a high amount of air traffic, and I was looking at planes at the time.  This object was lower in altitude then any planes in the area.   Lights vanished before reaching the horizon.  There was absolutely no sound whatsoever.  The object moved too fast to see any discernable shape.  Object moved incredibly fast in a straight line. The observer was alone at the time, and works in Technical Support for a large corporation.  I would just like to know if anyone else saw the same object.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Lights swirling around in clouds above Albuquerque;2012-07-07 22:00:00;Minimum 1 hour;Lights swirling around in clouds above Albuquerque I live at the foothills of Sandia Mtn.  Last night, I witnessed several lights appear above the clouds. They never came out from behind the clouds.  They spread out into a very large circle pattern.  They swirled within its own area in somewhat circular patterns very swiftly, then swooped towards the center, at which point it started over again.  They did this while rotating positions.  Normal reasoning would say search lights but this was far too high in the sky, far too spread out and again, you could tell they were above the clouds.  In addition, they moved much too fast to be search lights. They stayed for at least 1 hr. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

I posted this on Facebook this evening. 11-04-12 - Sunday. Okay. So I was working in the backyard today (Sunday, Nov 4th, 2012) and stopped to take a break. This was around noon.  I was looking at the beautiful New Mexcio clear blue sky.  Looking directly north up at the sky at about 50 degrees, a white object appeared out of nowhwere.  It started off slowly and began moving in a straight line directly east towards the Sandia Mountains.  I couldn't gaug e how big the object was nor how high it was.  It appeared to be pretty high, object was small and appeared white.  As it moved east, it slowly picked up speed and then &quotwhoosh!&quot, .... it went so fast it was gone in a heartbeat. Now I consider myself a pretty level headed person.  I'm not big on conspiracy theories, contrail chemicals, government cover-ups, or .... UFOs.  But ..... I know what I saw. I live in Paradise Hills was was looking north when I saw this. Question:  Did anyone else in the Albuquerque area see this?  No .. I wasn't drinking nor taking drugs.  And yes .. I was plenty hydrated. My primary need is I would like to know if anyone else witnessed this??? Thanks.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Some time between 23:00 11/09/2012 and 00:00 11/10/2012 myself and my partner were on patrol in the neighborhoods and watched a slow moving blue light cross the sky over the east mountains of Albuquerque.   Within minutes of seeing it there was a HUGE flash of white/blue light (lighting up the entire sky) focused on the light we saw descending on Albuquerque.   The light disappeared and there were several flaming balls of light falling like embers.   There was no sound or blast after the explosion.

There were two large green glowing ovals behind the craft and a flashing red beacon (which of course possibly signifies an aircraft of some kind).  I had never seen anything like it and have researched it myself on the internet and can find nothing like it.   It proceeded in a northwestern path until out of sight.  I could not make out what the vehicle might have been as the two green ovals are what really caught my eye.  The back drop of the dark clouds and the sheer darkness made the lights standout but made identifying the craft very difficult.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

As I approached, it began trailing small green lights below the larger red and smaller red lights in the shape of a comma.  I watched it in amazement and asked the other three people in the car if they saw what I was seeing.  All confirmed. Suddenly it turned and reversed the color sequence.  It was not a plane or helicopter.  It did not move position in the sky.  I passed it and took the Tramway exit then headed north on Tramway.

I was east-bound on the 40 just outside of Albuquerque, when I saw a bright blue/green flame appear in the sky.  I figured at first that it was just a meteor, but the object appeared to be getting bigger.  It was difficult to discern a definitive shape as I was focused on what appeared to be blue/green flames near the bottom, and I was driving on the busy highway.  I would say that it was not a smooth shape based on the flames coming off of it. I thought whatever it was, was going to crash into a hill that was coming up ahead, but I saw nor felt no impact.  An object of that size would have made some sort of projectiles. I was alone in my car but the highway was fairly busy so I would think that other drivers saw the object, as far as I could tell no one pulled over to have a look.  I was tempted to but didn’t pull over either.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
