The craft was no any commercial or military aircraft I've ever seen.;2014-01-26 18:30:00;18:45;The craft was no any commercial or military aircraft I've ever seen. While traveling north on Tramway Road, also known as State Road 556, I observed an egg shape object traveling north along the Sandia Mountains.  The craft was traveling at a slow speed at first.  I stopped my vehicle and watched the craft fly just above the Sandia Tram and then stop.  The craft then flew west directly over my vehicle and the road. Several other vehicles traveling on Tramway stopped because of this craft.  The craft then changed to a south easterly direction and flew towards Kirtland AFB.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Metallic object fell from sky in front of me while I was driving north a few miles south of Albuquerque Airport.;2017-09-08 18:25:00;split second;Metallic object fell from sky in front of me while I was driving north a few miles south of Albuquerque Airport. First, let me say that this was not a UFO in the sense of something alien, but it was definitely something falling from the sky (Unidentified Falling Object) on September 8, 2017, at 1825. I was driving north on I-25 a few miles south of the Sunport exit.  All of a sudden, this object fell out of the sky in front of me to my left.  It came diagonally across the highway at fairly close range.  I was driving past a collection of large white oil storage (?) facilities that were on the left.  The object seemed to fall between the highway and those tanks. It was hard to judge size but perhaps two fists in size might be a good guess.  It appeared to be shiny metallic but was not on fire or glowing in any way.  Made me wonder if a piece had fallen off a jet flying in that area.  If I had time, I might want to drive back there and look on the ground to see what I might find.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Saw a white egg shaped orb above I-25, in between Santa Fe and Albuquerque.;2019-08-22 12:00:00;15 minutes;Saw a white egg shaped orb above I-25, in between Santa Fe and Albuquerque. I was driving from Santa Fe to Albuquerque in the late morning, around noonish.  Driving on I-25, I looked out the side window of my car and noticed a white orb in the distance.  Over the next 10 minutes, it slowly approached the highway, with no signs of exhaust, wings, windows, or sound.  Eventually, it reached the highway directly about, probably about 500ft above my vehicle.  I noticed there was a hazy aura around the object and it was egg shaped.  Shortly after coasting above the highway, I noticed a military jet fly by in the distance, followed by a military helicopter that was heading straight for the UFO.  As I took my exit, I went around the ramp and proceeded to look back up in the sky.  I saw the helicopter above the highway, but the UFO was completely out of sight.  It had completely disappeared from the horizon.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Date July 28 2020 Time was approx 515-520 pm.;2020-07-28 17:20:00;17:20;Date July 28 2020 Time was approx 515-520 pm. I saw 3 egg looking possible ufos today. I was going south on wyoming between Academy and Montgomery when I saw what I thought was a helicopter carrying something coming to ward me to the left or east of me over houses... Initially it looked like it had something behind it had something flapping below it was kind of trailing... As it  got closer and I saw it clearlyâ€¦  It was 3 dark colored egg shapped things about the size and height in the sky as a helicopter. It was going south on the east side of the housing area off Wyoming.  The eggs were fast and quick and moved very soothly and quickly around each other extremely close!  It looked like a dance but probly more security I feel. It was in a straight line of travel but the eggs moved around like the cup game where bet that you can find the ball after the dealer moves the cups all over over under and around...and at constant speed. I saw it for maybe a good minute as I freaked and looked around to see if anyone else was seeing them...  Finally traffic got tight from roadwork and I couldnt look safely behind me.  I got to Candelaria at a red light and quickly looked behind me but saw nothing. My window was down.  I heard no sound of a helicopter, just my radio and cars;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
