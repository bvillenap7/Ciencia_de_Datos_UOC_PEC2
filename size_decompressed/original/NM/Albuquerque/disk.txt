red glowing object in daytime sky;1978-04-15 18:00:00;2 minutes;red glowing object in daytime sky My half-sister and I were at the home of a family friend in our neighborhood.  Our neighborhood at the time was at the western edge of town.  This house was one of the homes on the edge of the subdivision.  Right behind the house are power lines with those tall towers.  We were in the backyard, clear blue sky, bright sun...my eye caught something in the western sky.  It was red, and as it made its way towards us, I could tell that it was maybe no larger than the house.  It was red, very red, like it was pulsating, as it had the bright blue sky as a background.  It had no reflection, I remember because I thought that it should since the sunlight was hitting it, any metallic object might reflect.  When it stopped above the power lines, about fifty feet above us, it was then when my half-sister saw it as well.  I remember that it just hovered, and seemed to make a dull low-throbbing sound.  As it hovered, my half-sister began to yell and ran inside to get our parents.  While I stood there, the object just hung out, perhaps moving ever so slightly.  It seemed to be looking at me.  Then just as my half-sister came out, the object zipped a bit to the sides, and then shot straight up and disappeared. No trails, no sounds. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

mother ship;1983-04-01 13:00:00;2 hours;I was standing on the east side of Rio Grande up the rise, between the Albuquerque airport lift off to the north.  I felt a white hum and a slight pressure, I followed an airplane, taking off.  I followed it up to a point on the south of where I was standing.  The plane disappeared, I felt the white hum and slight pressure,  After  a short while, (not too long, maybe a minute or two or 5, the airplane appeared way north of the Albuquerque valley.  It was more to Rio Rancho north of Albuquerque.  The plane was just THERE.  after a short time, I felt the white hum and pressure move to the east toward the Sandia Mountains. The next day at church there were several families with children who lived up hill from where i WAS.  They confirmed what I saw...time, airplanes, sensation and sound. It was a huge mother ship for about a year after that we would be going places and sence the white sound.  Look up and there was a motorcycle.  They would sometimes follow us or even go out over Kirtland AFB. I have had many sightings and know people who have been taken up.  I met David ((last name deleted…a friend of NUFORC and Peter Davenport)) and he gave me this site.  ((witness's name deleted)) now live in Blaine, WA;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Disc close enough to almost touch no sound or air, no feet or legs cloaked until about 6' from it;1984-10-15 19:30:00;45 minutes;Disc close enough to almost touch no sound or air, no feet or legs cloaked until about 6' from it. In Oct, 1984 around 7:30pm while going to parent teacher meeting at Alvarado grade school in north valley of Albuquerque, NM, something very odd was experienced by myself.  Due to not enough parking in front of school I parked in the back side near the play ground.  As I was walking toward the classrooms suddenly there was something hanging in the air.  No sound at all, not sitting on any legs for feet, just hanging there and about 16 ft in diameter.  It was metallic with lights around the bottom in blue, yellow, red, green and purple.  I couldn’t believe what I was seeing so I walked back toward the car and it disappeared.  Walking toward the classrooms again and there it was once more.  It was as if it was cloaked in some way that unless you were within so many (6) feet of it, it wasn’t there at all.  While standing underneath it I tried to reach up and touch it but it was just high enough that it was out of my reach so about 6 feet high.  The upper part of it had w! hat appeared to be blackened windows. Suddenly a man came out of my daughters classroom walking very fast toward me.  I figured he had just got finished with his teacher meeting and also wondered why he had on sun glasses in the dark. He also had on a black suit, white shirt with thin black tie. I got his attention right away by requesting him to look at this, what is this?  Right away I could tell he was very nervous and asked me, look at what?  I said look at this medal thing just hanging here. He said it’s nothing and I said yes it is something what is it?  He said it’s for advertising.  It flies around advertising. I said to him that no it wasn’t for that at all, there was no sound and no air so it wasn’t a helicopter or airplane and it didn’t have any feet or legs it was just floating there and we had nothing that would do that.  Again I tried to reach up to touch it and he looked at the window and nodded. What was that about? I had no idea.  Then something happened to me and to this day I don’t know if I went into my meeting with my daughters teacher or not.  Actually I don’t remember at all how I got home, it seems that months and months are still missing from my mind. To this day I feel that this man knew exactly what this was and that he had in fact came in that thing to his meeting. Either this man was an alien himself or someone working with them.  Of course that’s just a very strong feeling I have and also I believe that UFO’s are always there, right in front of us but we can’t see them unless we get within so many feet of them or if by chance light hits them in a certain way.  I know as fact that it was a UFO! I have no doubt about it at all.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Large white glowing shape size of moon appears in sky at sunset in ABQ for 5 seconds suddenly disappears.;1994-09-30 19:00:00;10 seconds;Large white glowing shape size of moon appears in sky at sunset in ABQ for 5 seconds suddenly disappears. Was walking west on University of New Mexico campus right after sunset to meet a friend.  Noticed above one of the campus buildings that there was a glowing light, like the color of the moon, as big as the moon might be as it rises about 60 degrees above the horizon. It was shaped like a street lamp or as if the moon were elongated. Kept eye on it wondering what it was, but not thinking it was anything out of the ordinary.  After about 5 seconds, it suddenly disappeared.  Shocked, I started running to friend's building to tell her what I had seen.  She came running up to me asking me if I had seen it.  She saw the exact same thing I had.  There were others who were out that we asked if they too had seen it, but no one had.  We spent the night trying to contact Kirkland AFB and Sandia Observatory to see if anything out of the ordinary had been spotted and to report what we saw.  The next day I told my astronomy professor about it and his explanation was that it was probably the air force testing something.  To this day, we wonder what we saw.

They were about half the size of the full moon and arranged in a triangular pattern. When objects reached the zenith they suddenly turned to the east and rapidly disappeared in a clear sky. No sound was audible. Prior to my retirement i was employed as a electro- mech design engineer over a period of 40 yrs. During the early '50's, i worked at the Sandia Corp and obtained a Q clearance. Astronomy is my main hobby and i have spent about 50 yrs under the stars. 2nd Report:  Three disk shaped objects were observed to the north of the city and moving to the south. Objects were arranged in a triangular formation and appeared blue in color, almost matching the color of the sky. When objects reached the zenith they abruptly veered to the east and rapidly diappeared from view. When closes to this observer, the objects were approx half the full moon's diameter. This observer is an amateur astronomer and has been for the past 40 yrs. Prior to my retirement i have been employed as an electro mech design engineer at various firms for over 40 yrs. I have been furnished a Q clearance while employed at the Sandia corp during the early '50's.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
First look, I knew it wasn't something human made.;2001-05-26 02:00:00;2 hrs so far;First look, I knew it wasn't something human made. This is the second night I have seen this, Last night it was in the east & tonight in the south. A bright yellowish-gold sphere like triangle, moving in circular motions. Straight up and straight down, lights got brighter before it moved in rapid streaks. There is also star looking objects located in a circualr design around this object, some of the stars were like a blue-diamond color & the rest were the same color as the big one,it seemed as though they were moving the same exact direction, speed, and distance as the big one. It looked as though the sky was covered and these rotating objects have not changed The big one (is in the middle of this formation)would stop in mid-air and not move for awhile. This object has stayed within the same area for quite some time now. I know this has to be a sighting...Don't you???? Breathtaking, but not knowing how to get a closer/better look at this. Incredible!!! The sky behind and on the sides of the object was lit up. Now it has been in the sky for at least 3 hours, it has moved to the east,looks like the lights are bright white and a beam is coming from it. it is zig-zagging with rapid speed and then stopping and just hovering. I have taken pictures, but have not yet developed, considering it is still in the sky.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Two blue pinpoints of light merge onto one silver disk.;2005-10-01 09:30:00;10 minutes;Two blue pinpoints of light merge onto one silver disk. On Saturday morning at 9:30 AM October 1, 2005, with unlimited visibility on the far east side of Albuquerque, I observed what appeared to be a weather balloon approximately seventy degrees in elevation (not quite overhead) traveling at a slow rate of speed from NW to SE.  In the past I have observed 10-15 weather balloons released from Ft. Sumner, NM or Pasadena, TX.  Immediately I noticed two things which drew my attention to this object. The rate of travel to the SE was slow but much faster than any any previously observed weather balloon.  And the color of the object was brilliant silver as if reflecting sunlight from polished chrome, whereas weather balloons appear to reflect a dull white, almost beige, color. As I ran back in to the house to retrieve my 7x35 binoculars, I called out to tell my roommate to have a look.  As I was observing the spherical disk, now stationary, through my binoculars, I noticed what appeared to be a long, thin, silver antenna-like rod, three to four disk diameters in length extended from the top side of the object. The total estimated NW to SE distance the object traversed from initial sighting to stationary point was approximately 25 degrees (one palm width at arm's length equal to 10 degrees). At the same time, my roommate asked if I could see the two blue objects approaching the disk. When I handed the binoculars to my roommate, I then saw two bright blue pinpoints (not disks) of light slowly approaching the disk, also traveling NW to SE.  Initially, the distance from the blue lights to the object was approximately 35 degrees, the spacing between the two blue lights varying from 10 degrees, then closing to 5 degrees, then opening again to 15 degrees of separation and finally converging on the silver object with very little spacing between the two.   The closest of the two blue lights moved to the left side of the silver object and became stationary approximately 2 to 3 degrees from the silver object.  The second blue light became stationary approximately 5 degrees to the right of the silver object. After one minute of observing these three objects, the two blue lights disappeared as they converged onto the silver disk. Immediately thereafter, the silver object, with no observable acceleration, silently moved off to the NE at the rate of speed equal to two or three times a jet airliner traverses the sky. I, myself, have been watching the stars all of my life.  I have observed and photographed several solar eclipses, as well as many lunar eclipses and meteor showers.  A school I attended loaned me their 9 1/2 reflector telescope for the summer (not only is astronomy the oldest science...astronomy is considered 'the beautiful science').  It was an opportunity to teach the children of the neighborhood. While working night shift for four years at a small airport on top of a dark mesa ten miles west of the city, I observed several fireballs and the last successful re-entry of the Shuttle (to repair the Hubble telescope) before its final tragic flight. My roommate works at Sandia Labs generating software language for satellites.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Disk shaped object over Albuquerque, NM hovered and sped away at high rate of speed.;2006-02-24 13:12:00;20 seconds;Disk shaped object over Albuquerque, NM hovered and sped away at high rate of speed. At 1:12 pm, February 24, 2006, an unidentified flying object was sighted over the city of Albuquerque. The object was seen from a vehicle traveling southbound on Yale. The object appeared to be disk shaped and light colored/semi-reflective (white/light silver).  I am a pilot so I know and recognize most types of aircraft. This object appeared to be 1/4 mile south of my position and approximately 1,000 feet in elevation. At that distance, it appeared to be slightly larger than an F-15 (which we commonly see here). The object, I believed was going to approach our location as the airport was nearby. I was very curious to see the object closer so I could identify it as it was very strange looking.  However, the object didn't appear to be moving in our direction. Possibly moving slowly and laterally. After about 15 seconds, it began to travel away from us (north) at an incredible speed. It became a distant point before disappearing out of sight after about 7 seconds.  Weather conditions were calm and clear. No other air traffic was in the immediate area.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Hoovering Probe!..;2006-07-20 00:00:00;4:36;Hoovering Probe!.. At about 6:45 on the morning of July 17, 2006 I spotted what appeared to be a very large ball or object in the sky. At first glance, it seemed to be just a white weather balloon of in the distance. However, after I had brought out my video camera and zoomed in about half way the object took on a very distinct saucer shape. The object had a metallic color to it and the suns light was reflecting off the upper half of the U.F.O.. The object seemed to be relatively large because it was easily visible without any magnification devices, and it had passed over some clouds. We do have a 5 minutes video of such object.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
UFO Sampling Jets Contrail at 39,000 feet;2006-12-05 11:45:00;5 min.;UFO Sampling Jets Contrail at 39,000 feet Southwest Airlines FLT 1593 enroute from Albuquerque, NM to Baltimore Wahington, MD at FL39 (39,000').   I was sitting at a window seat on the port side of the airplane about 2/3 towards the back observing a United flight climbing from our lower right to upper left and then leveling out at our altitude.  I was amused at how nice of a contrail that plane had and started looking at how long it was when I first observed the craft.   It was approximately 1/2-3/4 mile behind the United flight and appreared to be almost stationary just above the contrail.  Its attitude to the contrail was approximately 15-20 degrees.   At first it appreared to be a scratch on the window I was looking through, but when I observed it from another adjacent window it was exactly the same.   For most of the observation, it looked as thought it was kinfe edge toward our plane.  Then for a brief period of time it rolled to reveal its real shape (circular).   I asked the passenger next to me if he had a camera I could borrow he said yes and proceeded to get it out of his bag.  When I turned to observe the craft again, it was no longer visible.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Multi colored object(s) and one object emitting white light only in the Far West Mesa area;2007-05-30 22:00:00;45 minutes;Multi colored object(s) and one object emitting white light only in the Far West Mesa area A full moon on this particular night, it was in the SE to my location.  I live on the very western edge of the city and further off to the west is where I observed the object(s).  If I had to give a point of reference, I’d say it/they were over the Rio Puerco (so 7-10 miles west of my location?) area and heading west, but very slowly. About 9:45 I was in my side yard which faces west.  I looked up to see an object with several flashing colors of light (red, blue, yellow, green).  It wasn’t moving.  I ran into the house to get a pair of binoculaurs.  Through them I could see the colors better and a faint outline of the object (disk/circular).  It wasn’t a helicopter, no noise, either.  The sunlight was very very faint on the western horizon, and the full moon light on the opposite side of the sky almost ‘helped’ it stay undetected, if it were not for the flashing colors.  I stayed there watching it for about twenty minutes as it just stayed in place.   Then my partnere came home and I walked inside to tell him what I had seen.  He came outside with me and looked into the sky.  Now there were two of those objects, a bit farther away now, but in close proximity to each other.  It looked like one was going towards the other.  Now, I looked NW and close to the horizon and saw a white light in the sky, not moving.  It could have been a weather balloon, but they usually are seen because the sunlight is reflected off them.  About 5 minutes later, there appeared another of these multi-colored lights N/NW of the white light (the other two are due S of these, still hovering, though they appeared to have moved further west).  This was looked like it was farther/smaller but moving towards the white light.  At one point it looked like it was going to meet up with the white light, but then we saw what could have been an aircraft with identifiable red blinking light trying to 'catch up' to it (jet fighter?) but then this multi-colored object began to retrace it’s path (no wide turning as would an airplan! e), stra ight line towards the white light object, straight line back. The (jet?) aircraft moved away from both. By this time I realized that there were no commercial airplanes coming in from the west, like we usually see.  The white light object went over the horizon and disappeared.  The 3rd multi colored object kept going N/NE until we couldn't see it anymore.  The original two objects moved slowly west, but I couldn’t determine if they were moving up in altitude or just further away.  After about 40 minutes, we saw several planes begin to emerge from the north (not their usual flight path, especially, not directly over our part of the city).  Through the binoculaurs we could see that they were commercial aircraft.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

I have no idea how he’s going to pay me for this one but I’ll go at it slowly.   As for me, in addition to my most abject apology, I ask you how I might make it up to you?  I’m so very angry in addition to my mortification.  I had asked him early on if he was using an app but he didn’t respond.  He was at work so I thought he was busy.  Sometime in the middle of the day he sent me another photo.  Later in the afternoon, I had the chance to look at it and I think it is after your call telling me you said it was most likely an overlay, and found it was strange both pictures had the “UFO” at the same angle and the same amount of the vehicle was showing.  Later even I looked at the third photo and it was the same as the others.  When I picked up my son, he admitted his “joke”.     My son has no idea how this affected me.  He doesn’t know what I’ve seen and wouldn’t believe me if he did.  Actually, I wouldn’t either if I hadn’t been with a person who was not connected to me in any way.  I’m not afraid, sir, I’m respectful of the information and implications.  These are real events that deserve careful research and consideration.

At 7:08 AM on April 4, 2018, while heading directly Westbound on Spain Road at the intersection of Spain Road and Eubank Blvd NE in Albuquerque, NM, I noticed a large, rust-colored saucer in the sky.   The saucer looked to be moving extremely slowly towards the North or Northwest approximately 2,000 Ft above the Albuquerque valley and approximately 4 miles West from my location.  At first, I put it off as an odd colored military aircraft taking off the same direction I was going, but the sky around the saucer became a lighter blue color in a perfect geometrical shape of a parallelogram.  I thought my eyes were playing a trick on me, and I looked forward to continue driving through the intersection.  I looked back up to verify what I saw, and the saucer was gone.   From the vantage point of where I was, I could see the entire sky, and no object was visible anywhere anymore.   I am a veteran of who has worked on airfields with every type of US military plane, and every aspect of this object was not consistent with any military aircraft I have seen, so here I am reporting this because I cannot verify what this UFO was even with my knowledge. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and found him to be exceptionally eloquent, and seemingly quite sincere, in his description of the sighting.  Also, because of his background in the military, we suspect he is an excellent, and highly reliable, witness.  PD));35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Classic flying saucer with lights, large, headed north in Albuquerque 7/14/20;2020-07-14 23:30:00;1 minute;Classic flying saucer with lights, large, headed north in Albuquerque 7/14/20 My  16 year old daughter exclaimed that a UFO just flew by outside. I hopped up and ran outside - we both saw what appeared to be closer/lower than an airplane (the airport and air-force base are close by and we often hear/see airplanes), it looked literally like a classic flying saucer with lights of different colors around its circumference (I thought it was red & blue, my daughter thought red & white).  This sighting was so much closer and bigger than any suspicious lights in the sky that I perceived as a possible UFO.  It was silent and moving slowly from south to north.  We called my other daughter, grabbed the binoculars and ran upstairs to get a better view but even though we hurried it was only visible briefly with the binoculars.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
