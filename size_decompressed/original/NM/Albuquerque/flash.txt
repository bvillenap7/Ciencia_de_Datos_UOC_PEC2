Small flashing white light & large fast white oval......;2008-03-23 12:55:00;two to three mins.;Small flashing white light & large fast white oval...... On March 23, 2008 at approx 12:55 to 12:58 PM , while looking at various high altitude jets and the contrails I notice a small bright white object about estimate 15000 to 25,000ft? It was at 55 degrees to the horizon facing and moving SW to a NE direction heading over and towards the north slope of the Sandia Mountains north of the city limits of Albuquerque. What I observed was what I though was a seagull or white bird catching thermals at a high altitude…the more I looked at it I notice a unusual side to side flight as if it was fluttering like a butterfly might fly. It was moving slow in a NE direction and notice it was blinking every one to three second intervals but at a location different from the other and no sound was heard, giving a fluttering appearance. At arms length the flash was the size of a button. The sighting seem to last two to three minutes before it was beyond the horizon from my view.  It was defiantly below the clouds and my guess is about the same altitude of private single or twin engine planes? I attempted to try and take photos with my cell phone but was unable to.  My second sighting was in August or September? of 1992? (unsure of date and year) on Albuquerque’s Westside at the apartment complex I was living at. It was sunrise on a weekend and I witness a oval, white illumined almost like the moon glow at a 75 degree angle from the horizon going north to south behind one cloud to another going three to four times faster than a commercial jet. At arms length it was the size of a quarter with no sound. A couple also witnesses what I seen and I made the comment to them if it was a shooting star? And one of them said that they don’t think so!  I am always watching the skies when ever I get a chance and I am very familiar with commercial, military and civilian aircraft as we have a Air force base and commercial and private airports near by.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
a bright light over Albuquerque NM;2010-05-25 22:00:00;10min;a bright light over Albuquerque NM it happens every night around 10pm -1035, I really don't know IF it could b the Space station or space shuttle.  But all I'm sayin is that I & my kidz have seen THEM from the outside of our place & every night so far we get some kinda activity.  I told a friend & he has seen it to & told me that iz this the ONLY time that I have witness this event.  I said NO one night I & my 13yr old son seen a flash in the sky over Abq.NM then it sorta made a straight shot over the sky & then looked like it just died out then BAM it shot over again & made a squiggley line down & then it was gone. we just couldn't believe our eyes, so we went back to tell every1 bout it & they told me it must've been a shooting star. I REALLY do believe that there are things out there that WE the human race can/ cannot explain, & what we saw & keep seening nightly NOW I'm a believer.

Redsish star or Mars appeared to fade away;2012-04-17 22:00:00;2 seconds;Redsish star or Mars appeared to fade away I was looking into the southwestern sky in the late evening.  The sky was clear. I had been looking for aircraft in that area. I saw what at first appeared to be a reddish star or Mars, but then realized the stars were not in the right place for that to be the case.  The reddish star faded out and I was somewhat shocked to see that happen since the star was stationary while I was looking at it. I don’t know what it was.  The light did not come back or reappear as a star might reappear if occluded.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Bright double-flash over Albuquerque's west side at 4:42 A.M MDT on September 8, 2014.;2014-09-08 04:42:00;1 second;Bright double-flash over Albuquerque's west side at 4:42 A.M MDT on September 8, 2014 At approximately 4:42 A.M. this morning, September 8, 2014, I was lying in my bed on Albuquerque, NM’s, west side waiting for 4:44 A.M, the time I get up every day.  I was on my back, facing my bedroom window, which is on the west side of the house, when through the partially-opened blinds I witnessed an extremely bright double flash of white light that appeared to come from the west-southwest at an angle of approximately 40 degrees above the horizon. The second flash, which instantaneously followed the first, was well-defined, circular, and appeared to be brighter but smaller than the sun, momentarily lighting up the entire outdoors as if it were daylight.  I would estimate the duration at approximately one second. The double flash was not accompanied or followed by any sound whatsoever that I could detect.  Since I have never before witnessed anything resembling this, I cannot estimate the distance of its origin. I could not find anything in the news this morning regarding this event, but I did find this web site and thought it was worth a post.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Unfamiliar craft with blinding reflective light in a sunny blue sky.  ((anonymous report));2017-02-23 15:10:00;1 minute;Unfamiliar craft with blinding reflective light in a sunny blue sky. A triangular air craft was sighted in the South sky on I-25 between the Alameda and Jefferson exits.  It stayed stationary and was shadowed as the sun light was bright.  As I stared at the craft to determine what it was, there was a bright blinding flash that came from the craft and shone for about 15 seconds.  It flashed the blinding light a second time for another 10 to 15 seconds.   I tried to determine what it was and what was the source of the blinding reflection or flash of light but then it suddenly disappeared.  It seemed to pixelate away in a matter of a few seconds.  I tried hard to find where it could have gone but it had disappeared.   Here are the facts:  it was a clear and sunny day with a blue sky.  I was in heavy congested traffic.  I was driving south and traffic was stop and go.  I am certain that others had to of seen this triangular object. It was lower in the atmosphere as a plane would be that was close to a landing strip.  This was definitely not an airplane or other known aircraft.  The flash was not a light but more of a blinding reflection as if someone had a mirror and was deflecting sun light into my eyes from the craft.

As I was exiting the freeway I noticed in my upper left Peripheral vision there was something traveling at an extremely high rate of speed too fast to be an aircraft.  There was a white light at the front of the craft, and a blueish light toward the back of it.  As my eyes focused on it the aircraft must have hit hyperdrive or something but the blueish light toward the back of the craft sped up (And got brighter) toward the white light in the front and as the two lights got closer together when they met the aircraft disappeared altogether!;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
