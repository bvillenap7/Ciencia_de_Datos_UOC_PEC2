Silent sphere with multicolored lights floats slowly over Albuquerque then shoots north then west out of sight.;1988-06-01 21:30:00;Appx 3 minutes;Silent sphere with multicolored lights floats slowly over Albuquerque then shoots north then west out of sight. I don't remember the exact year or month but it was in the summer of '87 or '88.  I parked my car in front of my parent's house in NE Albuquerque and got out when I spotted a spherical object with different colored lights flashing randomly.  It appeared to be about 50' in diameter and moving from east to west approximately 300' above the ground.  I'm a pilot and am pretty good at identifying aircraft, altitudes and distances.  The object was moving slowly, maybe 40mph, and was silent.  My first thought was this was a weather balloon and someone had rigged it with Christmas tree lights and a battery as a hoax.  I couldn't tell if the orb was tumbling randomly or if the lights just made it appear so. When the object had gone about 2 miles west of me it shot north (maybe 15 miles?) and immediately west and upward until it disappeared in the distance.  It did this in less than a second or two and made the 90 turn from north to west without slowing or arcing.  This was NOT a weather balloon nor am I aware of any aircraft that can move that quickly or perform an immediate change in direction like I witnessed. I was stunned in amazement at what I'd just seen.  I saw a man and a woman who were at a park about 4 houses up the street and asked them if they saw it.  They said they did and asked me what it was.  I asked them if they saw it shoot north and west and they had.  I wish now that I had talked with them more to compare our observations regarding size, shape, distance and speed.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Six Spheres of light move into my vision over the 92 Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta,then vanish straight up.;1992-10-11 10:00:00;15 minutes;Six Spheres of light move into my vision over the 92 Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta,then vanish straight up. We had just moved to Albuquerque and were attending the 1992 Balloon Fiesta. I had been photographing balloons all morning. At 10:00 the Fiesta was winding down only a few balloons were still aloft. Then it happened,two spheres of light about the size of 5 magnitude stars, moving from east to west moved into my line of vision & stopped directly over head. Two more followed,then two more. They too stopped & remained motionless for a short period. Then all 6 began maneuvering independently in straight lines with no given pattern,right,left,backward,forward. It was all happening directly overhead,well above balloon altitude. I took 6 photos using a 35-105 zoom lens,5 of the photos included balloons for scale reference. The 6th without balloons. All 6 spheres reduced in size,as if going straight up until they vanished.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
I was on my way down from the Sandia Mountain peak ( on a tramway) when I saw a bright orange flash and an ornange ball of light speed ;1994-04-24 00:01:00;2-3sec;Summary : I was on my way down from the Sandia Mountain peak (on a tramway) when I saw a bright orange flash and an orange ball of light speed by our tramway.  The speed of the orange ball was so fast that it crossed the entire valley in less than a second.  All I remember seeing was an orange flash in the distant horizon. I am barely reporting this because this is the first time I've ever seen this sight.  I have always remembered that night, and I marked it on my calendar because it really made me think and wonder what the hell that thing was.  Anyways, I think I was the only one in the tramway that actually saw the orange ball, but I know that everyone saw the flash. I know this because everyone was asking where the flash came from. Well, I wish I could write more, but I need to be going.  P.S. If you were around back in 94 I was wondering if I could find out if you had any similar reports for that same night;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Glowing sphere makes figure eight around two people.;1994-04-25 02:00:00;3 seconds;Glowing sphere makes figure eight around two people. 1st off the shape would have been a sphere of light. My friend and I were standing in my parents backyard (I was a junior in high school at the time). Behind my parents house was a park. The two of us were smoking and talking. Out of the corner of my left eye I saw a ball of light perhaps the size of a basketball raise up over the fence, I turned quickly to face it but all I saw was the trail of light it had left behind as it came towards us. I looked back towards Adam, his arms were raised above his waist level with his palms facing down and he was looking down. I looked down and I saw the trail of light this sphere had left behind as it made a figure eight around us. We are not sure if it made the figure eight around us once or twice. We think it shot across the yard after that and left over the fence towards the park (the same fence it entered the yard over to begin with). The object was moving so fast, it was really something else. The entire event took 2-3 seconds. This is TRUE.

A bright purple sphere Hoovers then uses some type of warp drive to dissappear.;1996-11-15 22:30:00;30 minutes;A bright purple sphere Hoovers then uses some type of warp drive to dissappear While hunting in the manzano mountains a group of us encountered something that really freaked us out.  It was the first night at the manzanos.  Around 2230. My dad and his hunting friends were sitting around the campsite drinking and having a good time. I was 18 At the time. I was sitting there just staring at the mountain.  I heard some type of chanting in the canyon.  I listened for about 5 to 10 min then called Ron to come verify what I was hearing. He Heard it too.  We listened to it for 5 more min maybe. We began telling everyone to listen to what we were hearing.  Then next thing we see is what appeared to be a light.  Very small in size.  Looked like a flash light start at bottom of the mountain and began to make its way to the top.  It maybe took about 10 seconds to make it to the top. At that point everyone was focused on the small light.  Then what happened next scared us all.  Once the light made its way to the top about 5 seconds a purple sphere came from the top of the mountain and hovered there.  It was bright!! Looked like a flare at first.  That's what it reminded me of.  It was no flare thou.  It hovered for maybe 10 seconds .. It then got brighter then at a 45 degree angle shot off into space.  I guess..  It left a tail behind it.  Then was gone. Me and my dads hunting friends put the camp fire out.  And were in shock.  We all went inside our campers.  What we seen was some other type of technology.  That was maybe watching our planet.  Everyone will say the same thing.. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Myself and my friend went outside to smoke a cigarette. From the east, a C-130 was flying in low toward the west. I commented on this to my friend, and we then noticed a small, flickering light in the general vicinity of the C-130, hovering stationarily. It appeared simillar to a star, or perhaps Venus. However, the time was approxamitly 5:10, much too early for any star to be visible or Venus to be rising. The object would flash very brightly, then dim in a flickering manner, and then seem to disappear. After a few moments, the object reappeared dimly, increasing in brightness, near where it had previously been. While visible, the object did not appear to move. But during its disappearing acts, the object would reappear in a different  but close-by location. During the event, three or four more C-130's followed on the heels of the first we had originally seen. My friend later informed me that he had seen a Huey about fifteen minutes prior to the sighting event. My friend retrieved a video camera and a set of binoculars. He filmed the object for about four to five minutes. Unfortunatly, due to the distance of the object (perhaps several miles), the focus was unable to lock in, and we have only  30-60 frames of a resolved image. Thru the binoculars, I determined the object to be metallic and spherical, like a ball-bearing reflecting the light of the sun. But a sphere would reflect the sun's light evenly and consistantly. Go figure. Within two minutes after the last C-130 had flown in low (and pressumably landed at Kirtland AFB very close-by), the object blinked out for the last time and did not reappear.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

I was walking through my living room this morning, when I glanced out my east facing windows that are about 20 ft up & I noticed a plane making contrails right next to another set of contrails....anyway I reached for my binoculars which were on top of the bookshelf near the window....I watched the plane fly out of view and then just focused on the contrail.....Then I got a real surprise!!!!! A small silver ball was flying through the contrail not too far behind the plane !!!!  A UFO !!!!  It stayed in the contrail for about 7 seconds then moved to a patch of blue sky between the contrails and hovered for about 3-4 minutes then went straight up at incredible speed! This is no BS!!!    I saw the UFO in the contrails !!! It was too cool !!! I grabbed my camera to no avail, I had no film....!!!

Saw a large, bright, spherical object being stationery in windy skies over the Albuquerque International Airport.;2000-06-03 14:30:00;1 hour;Saw a large, bright, spherical object being stationery in windy skies over the Albuquerque International Airport. I'm a computer consultant in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  While driving south on I-25 from Santa Fe to Albuquerque to pick up my girlfriend at the airport, I noticed what looked like to be a super large baloon over the Placitas area (north of the Sandia mountains, just a few mile east & parallel to I-25).  I was doing almost 80 mph the whole way and the object appeared to move in tandem with my car speed, maintaining approximately the same angle until I got to Albuquerque.  I stopped at a bookstore and had the manager come out and look at it.  It was entirely motionless then, translucent silver, and could have been a balloon.  I saw the sun reflections on both the top and bottom sides of this sphere, relative to where the sun was at the time.  It was a windy day in New Mexico, but this thing wasn't moving at all.  I stopped again to pick up mail a few miles away it still wasn't moving and I pointed it out to 2 other witnesses.  Finally I arrived at the airport and the object was directly above me and slightly south.  Figher jets were taking off, flying near the object, then landing immediately.  I saw them do this 3 separate times (and I'm told by neighbors that fighers do touch-and-go often in this manner, though it was my first time seeing it).  I met my girlfriend at the gate appx 3:21 pm and immediately pointed the object out to her through the airport window.  Within a few seconds, it began moving directly west, slowly but noticeable.  Within minutes the whole sky was covered with clouds and that was the last I saw of it.  Whatever it was, it was hard to ignore and lent lots of excitement to my afternoon. ((NUFORC Note:  We have learned that the object was a high-altitude balloon, launched from Fort Sumner, NM, by the University of Chicago.  The FAA released a Notice to Airmen about the launch, we are led to believe.  PD));35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Bright star like light visible in daylight, faded to faint star at night.;2003-09-19 19:00:00;1 hour;Bright star like light visible in daylight, faded to faint star at night. Right after sundown in the sw sky was an object resembling a bright star. The light was visible and very dominant in the blue sky right before it turned dark. As the sky grew darker the light started to glow orange. It made me think that whatever this was it was between the earth and the sun and as the sun set further it lost it's brilliance and slowly turned orange and faded. As nighttime passed the light had completely faded to a star that had to be observed using averted vision. This light/star tracked perfectly with the background stars also and rotated out of view after about 9:00 P.M. I would agree that this could have been a weather balloon had it not tracked with the background stars and faded to a very dim star.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
The object appeared to be a metallic looking sphere that flew in an erratic manner.;2004-06-03 15:40:00;1-2 min;The object appeared to be a metallic looking sphere that flew in an erratic manner. The object appeared to be a metallic sphere.  It appeared to reflect sunlight during the entire sighting and alternated between a metallic silver and a metallic red.  It was quite bright and flew in an erratic manner.  At first I thought that it was just a metallic foil balloon, but after observing it longer and based on my perspective with the Sandia mountains, I estimated the distance to have been 5-6 miles.   Given the estimated distance it was flying much faster than a typical small aircraft or helicopter would.  Best guess at size would be 10'-15' in diameter.  It disappeared behind a small mountain in the Sandia chain and was not seen again.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

It then came to a complete stop, hovered a few seconds and then seemed to float away from our position into a cloud partially concealing itself. It then reappeared on the other side of the cloud to our left, hovered, then disappeared from sight. At the time of the sighting we were driving in our vehicle and captured the entire incident on a digital camcorder. Played back in slow motion, aircraft, weather balloons and stars can be ruled out.

Cobalt blue sphere being chased at hight speed SE to NW from ABQ, New Mexico juxtaposition @ aprox. 9:30-9:35pm.;2007-03-01 21:35:00;~60 seconds;Cobalt blue sphere being chased at hight speed SE to NW from ABQ, New Mexico juxtaposition @ aprox. 9:30-9:35pm. Living in Albuquerque we are used to seeing aircraft, including the stealth fighter every now and then and the occasional air show. To us, lights in the sky are quite common.  However, on this night (tonight) we were driving home from the gym and as we turned down and adjacent street from the main road on our way home I saw two objects racing *fast* on a SE to NW direction.  No biggie, right, except these things were traveling really quickly across the sky in tandem.  I stopped the vehicle and pointed the objects out to my uncle.  We continued to drive around the corner (and had to to keep it in our sights). Here is the kicker... The object forward most was a cobalt bright blue glow. We thought is was an afterburner of a jet. But wait...following behind was another craft which had identifying FAA blinking lights. The light was red so we figured it was the starboard light that was flashing. The craft were equidistant from each other and by that I mean that the craft following or *chasing* the blue sphere didn't gain any ground nor lose any ground. As the craft flew out of sight, the blue cobalt sphere faded. We think this is because is was moving out of range of vision. The other continued to fade, too, meaning that the flashing red FAA light got dimmer and dimmer as it moved away from us. We had second thoughts on the afterburner glow as the craft following was keeping pace and did not show afterburner glow as one might expect. Also, the sphere did not have any identifying FAA flashing lights. It was a constant color and did not flicker. It is our belief that the former object was one of our (USA) jets. Neither took off from the airport as their trajectory was not that of a departing plane. We heard no sound of any kind and felt both objects were low enough to have been heard as they passed. They were about a 30 to 35 degree angle from our juxtaposition to the horizon. It was a crystal clear night and, NO, these weren't stars as stars do not fly across the sky at these speeds. There were no tree's obstructing our view and in fact we had to drive forward several times in order to avoid any objects such as houses and trees.  Basically, we were able to keep it within our sights with little trouble. There were not tails like that of a shooting star or comet.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

Sphere seen at Fourth of July Fireworks Albuquerque;2008-07-04 22:30:00;4 seconds;Sphere seen at Fourth of July Fireworks Albuquerque On the night of July 4, 2008, I attended the Independence Day celebration at Balloon Fiesta Park in Albuquerque NM.  The fireworks started approximately 2130 MDT.  My family and I were located at the south side of the field just north of the first paved roadway.  Thousands of people were in attendance.  The fireworks display was at the north end of the park about a quarter mile away from us.  We had an unobstructed view of the sky.  It was a clear sky with very little breeze.   About 15 to 20 minutes into the fireworks show, I saw a spherical object about 2/3rd’s the size of a full moon.  It traversed the sky at about 60 degrees above the horizon and 10 degrees too the right of the fireworks display from my perspective.  The trajectory was on a straight line from South, South West to North, North East.  It was light grey in color with some darker grey covering 1/3rd of the bottom.  It was visible for about three to four seconds and seemed to disappear into the sky.  It did not appear to be rotating.  There were no lights on it.   There were helicopters in the area from local news coverage but this object was not one of them.  The speed of the object did not seem remarkable but the object was going fast in a straight line then disappeared.

It took place a Balloon Fiesta Park with 50,000+ people there for the 4th of July fireworks display which started about ½ hour after my sighting.  The light was not flashing, but was constant.  The size is hard to determine, but I’m estimating the height of the light to be 10,000 ft, moving much slower than a commercial jet which I could see much further to the west.  I didn’t mention this sighting to anyone, because only in retrospect did its strangeness sink in.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

It sped in from the sky (down and from the east)--looked white/yellowish and moved like a shooting star, then began moving horizontally at a much slower speed and turned green.   Object moved at a regular, even velocity in a westward direction until it disappeared about 7 seconds later.  It was truly the strangest thing I have ever seen.  My boyfriend was driving the car and I was passenger.  I was in the middle of a sentence and just stopped speaking and pointed. My boyfriend noticed right around the time I did (and he was driving--that's how noticeable this object was).   As soon as the object disappeared, we both turned to each other and said, Did you just see that? During the observation, we were both so stunned by what we were seeing that neither of us could speak.  It looked so out of place and unlike anything else either of us had ever seen. I wish I had seen more.  Please let me know if you know anyone I can speak with who is familiar with these objects, and with ufos in general.  I have many questions and am very concerned that what I have seen is not of this planet.  I want to know why it seems like the government is hiding information from the public on this issue.  Thanks very much for any assistance you can provide to me. I hope I have given you some information you can use.

A brilliant, white, nonmoving light or orb seen in Eastern sky over Albuquerque for about 2 or more hours.;2013-09-22 06:00:00;07:30;A brilliant, white, nonmoving light or orb seen in Eastern sky over Albuquerque for about 2 or more hours. September 22, 2013 UFO Over Albuquerque, NM   This morning at around 0600 my husband and I were walking in a park near our house.  On the way there we noticed a bright, white light in the eastern sky which appeared to be stationary over the mountains.  We thought the light would be gone quickly but it remained in the sky for about 2 hours or more. We called a local radio station to report it and the man who answered said he saw it too this morning but it looked red (most likely due to the sunrise).  He thought it was a planet but it was too large to be Venus or any other planet or star.  It was about one tenth the size of the moon seen in the Western sky. As we watched the object appeared to move higher in the sky but without much lateral motion. When we started our walk we talked to some balloonists who were getting ready to launch and they had been watching it for some time as well and said they didn’t know what it was but suspected it was a weather balloon. There were four balloons that launched in the park and they quickly moved north and out of sight, but the object over the mountains remained where it was without much movement up down or to either side. When we got home we looked at the object with binoculars of 30-50x and it appeared to be spherical, extremely brightly lit (since the sun was behind the mountains and hence behind the object).  It looked like the inside of a led flashlight with little brightly lit circles inside. Many at least three other people at the park saw the light but we did not get their names.  We took a photo with our camera phone which will be e-mailed to you but it was indistinct and showed no detail.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

This lasted maybe a couple of minutes and they all sped off into the strom clouds.  At first I thought I was seeing stars, but what I saw was orbs that had a white glow.

White, Shape-Shifting, Sphere In Daytime Sky;2020-07-19 13:00:00;1 hour, still going on;White, Shape-Shifting, Sphere In Daytime Sky It is a clear and bright day today, so we at first were surprised to see a star in the sky.  The more we looked at the object, though, the more we realized it wasn’t a star at all and appeared to very suddenly change shape from spherical to oblong to an almost completely flat diagonal line.  It always returned to a sphere and maintained this shape more often than the others.  We went outside to take a closer look and we both witnessed it change shape again and, for a few seconds, disappear altogether.  For about 20 minutes, it appeared to not really move at all but then it would slide right (west).  We have had a closer look through binoculars (I was unable to get a bead on it with my telescope since it’s so sunny) and appears to be made of a rather shiny white material - the closest comparison is of polished white marble or mother of pearl.  The surface seems smooth but the light reflects oddly, which gives it the appearance of softness or liquid.  Thinking it could also be the comet, we looked through the binoculars several more times and agree that the object appears to be within our atmosphere and not on the outside.  It is very clearly 3 dimensional and there does not appear to be any of the distortion one might expect of an object visible in space.  At any rate, no idea what it is.  I thought for a minute it could be a simple weather balloon, based on its shape and the contours\colors of the surface, but it is in no way behaving like one.  We probably noticed it an hour ago and can still see it in the sky,  it’s moved more west and is sitting higher in the sky but is just as easily seen.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
