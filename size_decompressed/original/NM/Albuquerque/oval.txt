A gaint greyish football moving through the sky;1977-07-24 07:00:00;1 hour;A gaint greyish football moving through the sky It was a bright early morning, I was getting ready for guard mount, I was a Security Policeman in the Air Force, stationed at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico.  I heard a voice saying, what the hell is that? I said, where, and the Airman pointed toward the flightline. I saw this object the size of a football field, and it was shaped like a football. The object was slowly moving from left to right. the object turned right, and headed toward the ground, and it disappeared.  We called the airport to find out if there was Jets landing, and they said, no. There was nothing going on. The People We talked to said,  it's probably a cloud of some type. I'd say it was a UFO.

5 u.f.o objects seen in sky.One comes close to ground where i ride a bicycle .In daytime.;1998-11-04 15:30:00;4-5 mins.;5 u.f.o objects seen in sky.One comes close to ground where i ride a bicycle .In daytime. not sure exactly of the year but it was definatly on a change over of daylight savingstime date, I witnessed  very strange objects in the sky.On that day I was told at work that i could go home an hour early but i would be paid for a full day. During those years i rode a mountain bicycle to and from work daily.A bicycle trail that day i rode on my way back home i saw some black figures in the sky .At first i thought they were large raven sorta black birds or something ,thought nothing of it about 1 /16 away .As i concentrated steering my way down the trail and around a corner of the trail one of the objects somehow focused its attention on me and moved closer in front of me , about 30 feet in front 25 feet in the air. I came to a complete /quick stop on my bike. Then i heard noise to my left ,There were two males doing clean up work (raking weeds ,trash,etc.)About 50 feet across large rain channel/ditch, behind  alot of industrial fenced areas.They looked at what was in front of me and they got extremely frightened .They must of been mexican nationals seasonal workers .They were saying prayers out loud tone making signs of the cross and throwing their tools /rakes /shovels into their truck ,to get out of there in a hury.As for me ,i stayed still kinda frightened but ,curious at the same time.I took my riding glasses off and the object came a few feet closer and stayed perfectly still.It was a pitch black color and no sound came from it .A shape of oval or as  a shape of a large eye ,kinda glossy -it became as it moved up and to the right part of the bike trail.The other 4 or 5 figures seemed to stayed away or as to wait for the one close to me  to rejoin them.After a few minutes ,it slowly went back into a formation with the others and then extremely disapeared fast.       This was amazing for me to see those objects ,on that day ,confusing  although.Because i couldnt figure out what they were . They didnt look like transport ships or saucers ,But maybe a port hole to examine ?Unknown is! what i still call it. But very intelligent is a word to describe that occurance.     After they disapeared i kept riding on the trail back home ,kinda trembling and nervous at what i just saw.When i got home my girlfriend asked me What Happened? I couldnt talk for a minute still shooken up.I drank water then told her .After i told her she and i noyiced a scent on my clothes.She asked me was i working with fuel or around a generator motor.I told her no I wasnt working around any thing like that . A very strange scent ,almost like the scent around a railroad track where metal wheels travel at a high rate of speed like a burning metal smell.    Strange .   And to this day i never seen those 2 workers over there by the trail. But i might consider to advertise in a local paper to get in contact with them ,if there still here in albuquerque.But if i dont find them or they wouldnt want to talk,its ok .At least i know i wasnt halucinating ,they saw it too.And i want to see the objects again ,maybe to communicate .

white/silvery elliptical craft seen 45 degrees above horizon, due west, circling in the air rapidly before speeding off northwest.;2000-03-19 09:05:00;1 minute;white/silvery elliptical craft seen 45 degrees above horizon, due west, circling in the air rapidly before speeding off northwest. About 9:05 am i saw what looked like a single white/silver object circling in the air due west and about 45 degrees off the horizon. This aircraft I presume to be circular or egg shaped since it appeared ovallike at that angle of viewing. It appeared to be at a high altitude since it was small and so I don't really know how big it might really be. This object moved in a tight circular pattern, presumably observing something. It moved incredibly rapidly from my vantage point, over 600 miles per hour or so. It turned too tightly and too fast to be any known type of jet of aircraft and did not leave any trails, which a jet would have, at that height. The craft did not make any perceivable type of noise and did not emit any other things. There were no other aircraft in the area. It repeated the same manuever for about a minute before very rapidly zooming off towards the northwest at an even higher rate of speed. Again it made no visible or audible marks and this puzzled me as to how an aircraft could travel(presumably)several times the speed of sound and not produce a sonic boom After disappearing no other objects like it were visible and i could see no other evidence of its presence. The weather in the sky was cloudless and still nor were there any smoke trails left by airlines anywhere in the sky on that morning. I saw the object for only a sort time and I have no idea how long it was in the sky or if any others were present earlier or later.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

We were s;2001-09-21 20:10:00;5-7 seconds;A couple of friends, my wife and I were staying in Albuquerque (87104) at the Sheraton Old Town hotel on September 21, 2001.  We were sitting by the outdoor pool chatting, between 20:00 - 20:30.  We all saw bright chrome like, circular (somewhat elongated in direction or flight) object pass overhead at a high rate of speed.  There was no sound or sonic blast, so we assume it was traveling slower than the speed of sound.  Since it did not pass through any clouds, we assumed that it was below them, perhaps a few thousand feet above us.  It had no lights, although it changed colors from red to lavender to silver as it streaked across the sky.  It appeared like the sunset was reflecting off of it, but sun had set around 19:00.  There was no visible exhaust, flames, or vapor trail.  We first observed it almost directly overhead.  It was moving in a WWN (290 degrees) direction.  It was only visible for a few seconds, since it was traveling at a high rate of speed much faster than a commercial airline.  Its relative size would be equivalent to looking at an object the size of a dime held at arms length over ones head.  Since we had no explanation for what we saw, we assumed it would be explained as a weather balloon. However it did not look anything like a weather balloon and it traveled in a straight line and did not appear to gain altitude.  I am a retired automotive executive with a master's degree in engineering. My wife and I have been married for 39 years and have never seen anything like this before. Our friends have been married for 40 years and he is also a retired engineer. In addition, I am an amateur astronomer, so I have some knowledge in identifying objects in the sky, such as meteors.  Can you help explain what we saw?;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

lights;2004-10-01 20:00:00;1hr;At around 8pm I went outside on my porch to put out some trash and happened to look up towards the Sandia Mts. and saw a oval shaped dull (fuzzy)white light speeding through the sky. I stood looking for a few minutes but saw nothing more.  About 10 min. later I came back outside with binoculars because I saw planes high enough not to hear and I wanted to watch if they were circling the area.  As I moved out of view of the plane I saw two circular lights moving through or behind a small cloud. The lights were smaller than the oval, round and moving seperately, kind of zig zagging and very fast. At around 9pm directly overhead and much, much higher than the lights, I saw what could have been a shooting star whip through the sky.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

I live in the North valley, of Albuquerque, last night I was in my front yard admiring the beautiful clear night sky, when I saw and followed with my eyes, a satellite moving slowly south to north, I thought I would go out tonight and see if any were again visible,  Well what I saw tonight was Not a satellite.  At first I thought it was a airplane, But the closer I looked I noticed these lights were different the craft was moving very slow I had enough time to run in my house and grab the binoculars, I saw bright red yellow and white light all around the bottom of the ship not blinking but pulsing it was flying from the northwest valley heading out to the southwest mesa .;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275

I stared at it for at least 5 seconds before it just vanished. I have never seen anything like that. I know it wasn't a meteor or anything like that. It left no trail, nothing like that at all. It was the middle of Albuquerque! I will never forget what that thing looked liked. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Most Amazing thing I ever saw.  Night, in parking lot, look up and in sky fairly high and little distant is a little oval cloud barely moving, but a little . every 15 second it would pulsate blue with a dark blue line just inside the oval.  Like an arc light.  Then suddenly beams, dark fire engine red color, more like streamers popped out of one side and then slowly disappeared.  Only once.  Was it trying to communicate with me?  These red plumes were like slow moving  fireworks.  Turned around for one minute, and then it was gone.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
