large cross shaped ship flew over the city .;1998-12-15 22:00:00;15 seconds;large cross shaped ship flew over the city . i was driving west bound on central avn. (old route 66) at about coors rd. when i observed a bright light flying out of the north. at first glance i thought it was a single wing plane like a cessna with the wing on the top of the plane . it was so low i looked at it a second time and i then could see it wasn't an airplane. it was moving very slow and appeared to be so low that if you were on the roof of a house you could touch it. i told my sister who was with me in my car to look at that plane. the first words out of her was that is a big plane. at this point we turned into her neiborhood at the ship was almost directly to the north of us. i stopped my car in the road and rolled my window down so i could see the ship right above us. i asked my sister if she could hear an engine . she said she couldn't. at this point when it was directly above us. i could see nothing but a blackness against the night sky. the were 3 lights on the underside of the ship. one almost at the end of each wing and one in the center of the wing where it joined the body of the ship. it moved beyond our vision because of the trees and houses.  a few houses down at my sisters house a family frind said he saw this large plane , and that it was moving very slow.  the ship had a very large wing span. it looked like it was the size of a commercial jetliner, but it was very slow and no details could be seen other than the 3 orange/white lights.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
It was a black cross that was about 500' away flying slow and totally silent;2017-04-18 20:30:00;5 minutes;It was a black cross that was about 500' away flying slow and totally silent It was about 500' away flying about 300-400' above ground.  It was black, shaped like a cross flying slow and as it rotated in the air is became just a pencil like line, then turned again to see a cross shape.  It was completely silent.   I watched it for about 5 minutes as it became smaller and smaller in the distance.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
Dark cross shape with light like shimmering rhinestones: three on each side of each arm.;2020-08-02 03:57:00;10 minutes;When first observed, I was woken up by thunder and lightning but noticed it was a generally clear sky.  To the naked eye, it was observed as larger-than-a-planet light with binoculars, it was a dark cross shape with light like shimmering rhinestones: three on each side of each arm.  The brightest light was in the middle of the cross.  Orange spherical object on right arm- like looking at a planet. It stood still for ten minutes then backed away steadily.  When it became visible only as a light, it began moving in a fast spiral figure-8 motion until completely out of view.;35.115939668508;-106.613188950275
