This is the strangest thing ever we saw while my husband and I were sitting on the deck, no lights on,  just enjoying the stars!  All of a sudden 1 bright yellow/orange circle appeared and split up into a total of 5 yellow/orange circles. We jumped up and said: What's that?!  That's not a plane or more planes, or fireworks, there is no sound at all!  They moved from right to left sideways and than went dark. My husband ran to the side of the house and saw 2 more as the first 5 disappeared, than they went dark too. And relative to the size of the stars they were huge! Some time later an airplane past by and the size of its lights were equal to a pinhead, while the objects were about the size of a dime. We have always been sceptics but not anymore and sure hope they come back.;33.3474;-105.651
