It was followed by an aircraft at distance of 1 mile behind the object. The aircraft was flying lower and to the north of the object. I watched for about 4 minutes and it continued east out of my sight. I then observed a fast traveling aircraft that appeared to be trying to intercept the other aircraft and object but at a much increased speed like it was in pursuit from 5107B which is the restricted airspace at Holloman AFB.  I was a airport manager in Ruidoso for 10 years and a certafied weather observer with the National Weather Service. I also am a pilot.  I reported this to the Roswell P.D. for possible observation.
