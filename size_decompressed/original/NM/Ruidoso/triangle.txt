((anon. report);2017-10-21 11:12:00;1 minute;My girlfriend and I where outside, stargazing, when we saw a low flying object with lights on each end in the shape of a triangle.  We where perplexed at first, thinking it may have been a shooting star, but then notice it was blocking other stars from sight as it was passing by.  It was silent, and eventually just disappeared from sight. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.3474;-105.651
