Unusually fast moving object;2017-05-04 22:00:00;5 minutes;Unusually fast moving object Around 10 pm I saw something go hauling a** east of Edgewood, NM, thru the sky. Direction of flight was South to North.  Whatever it was was moving much faster than any other aircraft overhead.  It didn't have a tail or a streak.   I do not believe it was a falling star as it contunued its path direction until out of sight, and showed no evidence of losing altitude.;35.0776;-106.1872
