Triagular object;2007-03-17 14:45:00;2-3 minutes;Triagular object While in my sunroom which faces East, I looked up out the window and saw an object nearly straight above me. Thinking it is a weather balloon like I have seen before I got out my binoculars to get a better look. I couldnâ€™t get a real good view of it so I went outside. I was able to get a better look and saw a triangular object, it was metallic in color and each corner of the object was dark. I heard no noise coming from it, yet I could here the engines of passenger jets as they passed overhead shortly thereafter. I could not determine the altitude because it was overhead with nothing to reference it against. I watched the object for a couple of minutes and then went into the house to get a more powerful set of binoculars, I was gone for less than a minute and the object was gone. I scanned the skies and could not relocate it.;35.0776;-106.1872
