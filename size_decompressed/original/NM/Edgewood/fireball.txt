Orange/Red ball of light moving across night sky at low altitude.;2014-12-21 19:00:00;30 seconds;Orange/Red ball of light moving across night sky at low altitude. Witnessed round orange/red ball of light moving across sky from West to East.  Roughly ~15,000 ft elevation.  Flew right over me.  Zero sound.    Object completely vanished.  Could only describe it as a miniaturized sun that was flying in the evening sky.   Have a cell phone video, but quality is poor.  Object was bright enough for phone video camera to see.   Object was FAST.  Moved many times faster than air traffic.;35.0776;-106.1872
