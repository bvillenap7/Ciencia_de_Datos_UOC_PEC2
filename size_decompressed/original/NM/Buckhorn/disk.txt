Bright flashing object near Buckhorn, NM.  ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect a star or planet.  PD));2012-04-17 23:30:00;1.5 hours;Bright flashing object near Buckhorn, NM. I went out behind our home for a cigarette and looked to the west over the Arizona, New Mexico line and noticed a light about a hands width from the top of the mountains. The light alternated from blue, white and the a very brilliant red.  The pattern of the flashes was not like that of aircraft. It hovered over the mountains for about 15 minutes, then moved to the left and the right very slowly. Later it moved straight up and in like a very fast zigzag pattern.  We also noticed to the northwest a red light that was matching the larger, brighter objects movements.  What really caught our attention was when my wife noticed beams coming from the bottom with blue and red flashes emitting from behind the mountain.  The larger appeared to move due west at great speed and disappeared.  We never saw the red light again either.  During all this there was no noise. We also noticed commercial airliners pass in the vicinity of the brighter object with no response.  My son had brought out his rifle which had a scope on it and this is when we noticed it was flat, or disk shaped.  The brilliant red lights were in the center and the blue was on the outsides.  The disk was a very white, bright color.  The flashes appeared to be random with no pattern to them at all.;33.037;-108.7084
