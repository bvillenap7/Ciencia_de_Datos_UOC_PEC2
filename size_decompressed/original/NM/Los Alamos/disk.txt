On the afternoon of March 19, 1993, fourteen of my co-workers and I suddenly were stopped in our tracks when we saw (from a high plateau on the Los Alamos, New Mexico hill viewing to wards Pojoaque, New Mexico) three extremely large disks (at lease 1/2 mile in diameter) emerge from nowhere and enter into a very wide opening in the ground. We were at lease fifteen miles (as the crow flies) from the landing site. When each one of the disks entered the opening , one after the other, then the earth closed. I was the only one who remembered the sighting, as the others only noticed that a few minutes had elapsed.  I pass through Pojoaque daily and I have tried to find the exact landing site, but it is on a Native American (Indian) reservation land. A particular section of the reservation that non-Indians are not allowed to visit or enter.;35.8663;-106.2676
