When I opened the door there was a huge perfect bright gold ball like object. It was very low, almost like just above the tree lines on the other Mesa to the north.  It moved very slow and in a perfect straight line. No blinking lights or any kind of movement. Just slowly moving in straight line from West to the East. I moved further outside to watch it and it slowly moved in that perfect straight line and then poof and it was gone. My dog was being weird and waits for me to call her in but when she was done she ran into the house. And in the morning she refused to go outside at 6:00 am her normal time for 10+ yrs. later today she keeps barking towards the same area. There is now why it was a satalite satellite cuz it was so low and so big. Very strange and no noise either. Of course I did not bring my phone with cuz it was so early;35.8663;-106.2676
