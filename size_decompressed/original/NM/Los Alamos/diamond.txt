Bright diamond-shaped object;2007-09-13 18:35:00;20:00;Bright diamond-shaped object Diamond-shaped object that reflected a great deal of sunlight was spotted from a good distance away (at least 30 to 40 miles by my estimates). I can only guess it was centrally located in the Jemez Mountains/Caldera region of Northern New Mexico. It did not move - it was too bright to be a star since 6:30PM had a fair deal of sunlight in the sky. It was extremely bright and didn't resemble any sort of weather balloon. I thought it was a star or planet at first but after dusk it slowly disappeared. The witnesses I contacted during the ordeal also confirmed it was not a star.;35.8663;-106.2676
