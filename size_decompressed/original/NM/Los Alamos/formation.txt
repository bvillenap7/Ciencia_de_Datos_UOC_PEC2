3 lights connected by red string.  ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD));2019-05-26 21:41:00;45 seconds;3 lights connected by red string I was looking up at night sky for satellites and saw 3 stars really bight.  I thought they were the constellation the 3 ladies, I think.  Then they headed north east very fast like 3 stars connected by a red string.  My daughter ran out and as they went overhead you could see 2 more following them.  Then they went straight north by the time my husband saw them.   They were moving so fast and no sound and no blinking.  Like 5 stars connected by a string. Freaked us out and we left phones inside house. ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.
