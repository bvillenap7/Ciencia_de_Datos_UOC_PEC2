It was golden in color and had no seams. It made no sound, no odor, no wind. But it was not a balloon. It was on a difinite course. I saw it about 50 ft. above me and traveled at about 5 mph. I could have thrown a rock at it. I don't care what was inside, I just want to know how a 60 ft. by 20 ft. craft stayed up there without the usual signs of engines. Incidentally, this is a TOP SECRET installation and is in a NO-FLY ZONE. tHIS AREA IS ALWAYS MONITERED and you need a security clearance to get past the security guards.  Have you had anyone report this? I'd like to know if radar or the military picked it up? ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in 1973.  We will request that the witness contact the other witnesses, and have them submit reports, as well.  PD));35.8663;-106.2676
