Lights in the sky above Santa Clara/San Ildefonso.;2014-01-03 18:15:00;~1 minute;Lights in the sky above Santa Clara/San Ildefonso My son and I were driving past Santa Clara Pueblo on our way towards Los Alamos when we both witnessed a bright blue light with 2 round bright red-orange lights directly below it shoot straight up and slightly to the left from behind the western hills above Santa Clara/San Ildefonso.   It was traveling very fast then quickly disappeared.  The lights appeared to have a shadow of something that connected them.;35.8663;-106.2676
