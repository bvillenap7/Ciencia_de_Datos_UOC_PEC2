The airborne object(s) remained in one position for about 5 minutes then apparently rotated on center axis about 30-degrees clockwise, and remained there for about 10 minutes.  There were about 12 to 14 lights in all, and they appeared to be associated with one single object.  One set of lights, 2 to 3 in number, located on the left-side view-point rotated separately from the rest of the lights.  At approximately 19:00 the lights went out.  See video tape for more detail.
