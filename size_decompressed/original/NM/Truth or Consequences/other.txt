3 Days of UFO Activity in Truth or Consequences, NM, 30 Sept. to 2 Oct., 2011;2011-09-30 20:10:00;3 nights;3 Days of UFO Activity in Truth or Consequences, NM, 30 Sept. to 2 Oct., 2011 NIGHT 1 (Friday, 30 Sept., 2011) Approximately 8:10 pm:  At approximately 8:10 pm, a string-like, rod-like, smoothly flowing, almost organic shaped (wing*) passed overhead, seemingly several hundred feet in the air, almost directly over my backyard.  It came from NNE and moved SSW, visible for approximately 3 seconds.  It came out of the darkness and disappeared back into the darkness- very stealthy!  Its length was approximately 20 full moons (if the full moon was directly overhead- that’s the size I mean).  It was illuminated as a white tendril (like an elongated “U”).  Approximately 30 minutes later, I saw a black and gray checkered bird-wing-like object pass in a short North to West corner sweep.  It appeared to the west of my yard, seeming to be directly above the ground a block or two away.  It was visible for approximately 2 seconds.  It seemed lower in the sky than the tendril object, maybe 100-200 feet high, and covered an area approximately 2-3 full moons.  If it was an owl’s wing (it was night), it would have to be, I’m guesstimating, at least 20 feet across.  Approximately 30 minutes later, I saw another tendril object.  It seemed to be about half the size of the first tendril object and a little lower in the sky than the first one.  It passed just slightly to the East of the first tendril’s position but along the same general trajectory.  It was visible for approximately 2-3 seconds.  Approximately 30 minutes later, I saw the last tendril, about 1/4 the size of the first, traveling even more eastward (nearly straight south), visible for approximately 2 seconds.   NIGHT 2 (Saturday, 1 Oct., 2011) Early Evening:  I saw another black and gray checkered object (like object 2 from Night 1).  It seemed slightly smaller than the first one (from the night before) but more or less the same and in the same part of the sky.  Like the first one, it seemed to pass above an area about 2 blocks to the west of my yard.   NIGHT 3 (Sunday, 2 Oct., 2011) Just Before Dark:  Far off to the east, well beyond Turtleback Mountain which is at least 1/4 mile away, I saw a huge flying wing, much like a boomerang shape, all black, silhouetted against the barely lit sky to the east.  It looked like it could have been several, even many miles away.  It appeared face-on and traveled approximately south to north, visible for approximately 3 seconds.  It looked to be possibly hundreds of feet wide.;33.1606;-107.2669
