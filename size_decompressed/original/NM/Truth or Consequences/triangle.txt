The orbs were moving very fast, about twice as fast as any aircraft I have ever seen.  It or they were moving WSW and I only observed it for about a second and a half and then it was gone. The orange lights weren't very bright but dimmed and looked fuzzy. It did not look like aircraft lights I have seen before.

It appeared to be changing colors rapidly, which is what caught my eye. I immediately took out my phone and started to record what I was seeing. My partner was also on the way out the door for work. We both stood there in awe, looking at this mysterious flashing light. It didn’t appear to be moving. I got in my car and headed to work. The entire way their I watched the light and it didn’t appear to move until I arrived at work and got out of my vehicle. At this point in was in motion and headed straight towards Turtleback mountain. It flew right overhead, as it went over I could see it’s entire shape of it from its underside, at which point I realized it was a triangle. It had 3 white lights on the underside. One in each corner of the triangle. It appeared to have color changing lights on top of the craft. The craft was completely ! silent as it flew overhead.;33.1606;-107.2669
