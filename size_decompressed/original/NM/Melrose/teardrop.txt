Bright Object in Eastern New Mexico Sky;2012-10-09 18:00:00;1:00;Bright Object in Eastern New Mexico Sky The sighted object was observed Wednesday, October 9, 2012 from 1800 to 1900 approximately five to ten miles, north/northeast of Melrose, NM.  It appeared to be a celestial object until we brought out the binoculars for better viewing.   We were able to observe the craft for over an hour. It appeared to maintain its height and distance during the entire viewing.  Through the binoculars it appeared to be the shape of a clear plastic weather balloon with two bright lights inside.  The lights allowed us to watch it until late sun down when they dimmed to a soft red and eventually faded from view.  Due to distance and the power of our binoculars we could not confirm exactly what it was.  We never did see it descend or gain altitude.;34.4472;-103.6278
