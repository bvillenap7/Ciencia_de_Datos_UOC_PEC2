After about 30 mins of watching this strobing light more lights were seen in the sky. At first, 2 lights were seen moving in the same direction but not in close proximity. After about 15 mins we saw more lights in the sky moving in different directions in an area of about 100 miles. These lights were observed first from the naked eye and then with binoculars and a telescope. The lights both on the ground, that kept getting brighter and moving around, and the ones in the sky, had a honey-combed design inside of them. the lights in the sky moved around the area for about 2 hrs. The lights on the ground kept getting brighter until it finally reflected on the walls of the cabin we were in. In the morning, the light on the ground was still there, but much dimmer. It was only strobing a slight bit but was still too far away for us to track. There were no houses, roads, boats or any other form of civilization nearby and these lights have never been seen in this spot by anyone else in the past 3 years.;36.8962;-106.5779
