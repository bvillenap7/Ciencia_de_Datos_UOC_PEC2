Formation of 6 orange/yellow lights fading individually from left to right and re-emerging;2015-03-10 21:30:00;3 minutes;Formation of 6 orange/ yellow lights fading individually from left to right and re-emerging My wife and I were driving home at about 9:15pm on Tuesday, the 10th of March.  We were driving NE on hiway 70. I looked out of my driver's window and saw several very bright orange/yellow lights in a stationary line formation, so I pulled over immediately to observe them.   As we sat parked on the side of the road we saw that the light farthest to the west was fading rapidly and at the same time a new light at the east end of the formation was emerging, this went on for several seconds, until a small cluster of lights formed at the east end of the formation, and the rest of the lights from the west end all faded away.  As I was trying to record them with my cell phone they all disappeared.   We sat looking for them and discussing what we saw for a few seconds and then we pulled off and continued driving about 500 feet to our entrance and as we turned in and were driving west again we saw the same bunch of lights so I drove towards them trying to get a better view through the trees and after that we only saw them for a couple more seconds through the trees and they were out of sight again.;33.3565;-105.5375
