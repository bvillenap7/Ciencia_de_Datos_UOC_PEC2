My girlfriend and I were leaving from visiting my parents house.  We were saying out goodbyes and noticed a very bright light moving at a very high rate of speed, coming from a west-southwest direction.  My father dismissed it as a satellite.  I have seen satellites and honestly, I felt this was nothing of the sort.  No sound, nothing odd in trajectory as it moved east-northeast.  Simply larger than any satellite I have ever witnessed.  It moved further on its course but never faded. 		We then re-attempted to get ready to leave.  Within a minute of the first light losing our interest, we noticed three more lights coming from a similar west-southwest position.  I could tell they were not moving in straight lines.  The first of these three was a little smaller than the light that had passed moments before.  The third in line was similar to this size and brightness.  The second of this line was the slightest bit smaller. 		The second light started to move off of its course and got behind the third light.  When they were approximately at a 90 degree above us, the smaller second light sped up and seemed to contact the third light that was ahead of it.  The entire time there was no sound what so ever.  The second and third light continued to dance across the sky until they we at a 45 degree, still following a general east-northeast path.  Here they moved into a line.  I relate it to Orion's belt.  They stayed in this position for many minutes, with binoculars we watched them for ten minutes or more, almost as if they had paused in place. 		We had to attend to animals so we said our goodbyes in awe.;32.8402;-104.4058
