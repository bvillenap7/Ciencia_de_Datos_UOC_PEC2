To the South we saw a bright green flash the size of a small plane about 300 ft above the ground, then a skidding, green fireball, like a satellite entering the atmosphere or similar to the way a rock skips over water.  It flew for about .5 km before disappearing.  From the time of the first flash to the time it disappeared was about 3-5 seconds. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I was thinking the same thing.  It seemed to have landed near or in Brantley Lake.  Because of the lights not covering the entire area of its surface and it being visible between flash and skid I'm uncertain what it was.  I have seen meteors before.  Because of the similarity to a report from the same area 2 hours prior, I'm almost certain it was not a meteor.  There was a barking and whining band of coyotes running from the area after we heard a coyote yelp.  We were startled by this and left the area.   Thank you for your response.  I honestly do not feel what I saw can be as easily explained. ((END ADDENDUM));32.8402;-104.4058

At first I thought it was a comet, but it never seemed to get smaller and picked up in size and color as well. if i were to accurately describe it, i'd say it was as if a plane was on fire, still in flight, headed towards Roswell, NM...;32.8402;-104.4058
