Color shifting of several craft in night sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly twinkling stars??  PD));2019-05-15 21:00:00;ongoing;Color shifting of several craft in night sky As soon as it gets dark, I see many lights in the sky which rotate thru a color sequence: white, red, green.  They move as if someone is learning how to pilot the craft.  They are too far up for my naked eye to make out a shape and I donâ€™t have the glass to see any better.  They are still there when I go to bed at midnight.  This has been occurring every night for weeks. ((NUFORC Note:  Possibly twinkling stars??  PD));35.6522;-106.3425
