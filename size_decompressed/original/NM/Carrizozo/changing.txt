I was driving trying to keep an eye on it and as I watched it, it just disappeared.  I also saw something else that could be related, it just didn't look right two lights almost looked like they were hovering and they did change location in the sky and were lower than the stars or what could be satellites, it did not look right to me;33.6471;-105.8623
