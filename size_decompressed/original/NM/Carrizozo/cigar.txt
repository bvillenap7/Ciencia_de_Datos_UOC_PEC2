LIGHTED CLOUD IN SKY;2005-06-22 22:00:00;3 hours;LIGHTED CLOUD IN SKY WHEN IF FIRST NOTICED IT I WAS LOOKING UP AT THE SKY WHICH WAS THIN SCATTED/I NOTICED A SMALL PATCH OF CLOUD THAT WAS SHINNING, I GOT BINOCULARS OUT AND SIGHTED THEM IN.  IT WAS LIKE A LONG CIGAR WITH A WINDOW ON EACH END.  THE ENTIRE CRAFT WAS WHITE, I SUPPOSE THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN SILVER IN THE DAYLIGHT THE TWO WINDOWS WAS A LIGHTER WHITE AND CIRCULAR, OUT OF WHAT I CALL THE BACK END THERE WAS TWO LONG BLACK HOSE'S STRUNG OUT. I DO NOT KNOW HOW FAR BECAUSE I LOST THEM AS A FOLLOWED THEM BACK WITH THE BINCOCULARS.  I THOUGHT I MUST BE SEEING THINGS, TOOK MY BINOCULARS DOWN LOOK UP WITH THE NECKED EYE IT IT JUST LIKE A WHIS OF A CLOUD.  THE OBJECT REMAINED MOTION LESS TROUGH OUT THE PERIOD OF THREE HOURS.  i REPEATED ALL THE ABOVE ABOUT EVER FIFTEEN MINUTES UNTIL I LOOKED UP AND IT WAS GONE, I NEVER SEEN ANY MOVEMENT AT ALL.  THIS TOOK PLACE TO THE EAST OF WHITE SANDS MISSLE RANGE ABOUT 15 TO 2O MILES EAST OF WHAT IS CALLED OSCURO PEAK.  ALTITUDE HAVE NO IDEA. CIGAR SHAPED OBJECT WITH LONG LINES TRAILING OUT THE BACK END APPEARED AS MISTY ((ADDENDUM FROM SAME WITNESS)) THIS IS AN UPDATE ON REPORT I SENT IN LAST WEEK.  FIRST OF ALL A LITTLE ON MY BACK GROUND. I WAS IN THE AIR FORCE FOR 20+ YEARS.  I WAS A RADAR OPERATOR (AC&W) for six years, an airborne radar operator for 7 YEARS AND CROSS TRAINED OVER INTO THE AIRBORNE COMMAND POST. UP ON RETIRING I WORKED FOR CONARGA FOR 20 YEARS AND RETIRED FROM THEM AS A PLANT ENGINEER. TODAY RATHER TONIGHT I WENT BACK TO THE SPOT WERE I OBSERVE THE OBJECT, USING MY BINOCULARS I ESTIMATED THAT I WAS LOOKING UP AT ABOUT FIFTEEN DEGREES, THE MOON WAS UP THAT NIGHT BUT IT WAS IN THE CLOUDS TO THE EAST OF ME.  I WAS LOOKING AT IT TOWARD THE SOUTHWEST, THE AIRCRAFTS THAT WERE IN THE AREA WERE HIGHER THAN SAID OBJECT. INFACT I THINK THEY WERE PART OF SCHEDULED AIR PATH, BECAUSE THEY COME OVER ABOUT THE SAME TIME EVER DAY, OR THEY WERE FIGHTERS TRAINING ON THE RANGE, THEY DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE ANY INTEREST IN THE OBJECT.  I WILL BE EMAILING YOU A MAP AND DRAWING OF WHAT I SAW.  I WOULD BE GLAD TO ACCEPT A COLLECT CALL, BUT I ONLY USE CELL PHONE FOR LONG DISTANCE.;33.6471;-105.8623
