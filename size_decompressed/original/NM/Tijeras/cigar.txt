The object we witnessed (there were two of us) was very fast & steady, no FAA blinking light present. It moved horizontal across the sky & then stopped. Next, it moved to a parallel point in the sky & stopped again, then it proceeded to the original point creating a triangle. It suddenly dissapeared at this time. I recently met someone who witnessed the same exact pattern/situation 15 years ago in NM. The date & time are approximate.;35.0438;-106.3024
