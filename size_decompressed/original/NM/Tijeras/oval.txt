Two oval shaped spheres travelling rapidly west over Tijeras Canyon;2016-08-12 16:30:00;4 minutes;Two oval shaped spheres travelling rapidly west over Tijeras Canyon At approximately 4:30 PM on August 12, 2016 my wife said 'I see a UFO!'  We noticed it a few miles to the west rapidly heading towards Albuquerque.  It was small and looked like a star. As we discussed this, we noticed a second, rather large oval shaped object nearly overhead just slightly to the south of us.  It looked silver and we saw no indication of wings or tail.  It traveled very rapidly on the same course as the first, quickly becoming a small white dot racing for the western horizon. We have never seen a phenomenon like this!  It seemed as fast or faster than a military jet in hot pursuit.  We'll never forget this odd experience.;35.0438;-106.3024
