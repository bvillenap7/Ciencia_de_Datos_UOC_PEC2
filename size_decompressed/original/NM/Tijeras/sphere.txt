My home is located in a mountainous region at 8,000' 20 miles SE of Albuquerque NM and about 5 miles east of an air force base, Sandia Lab and weapons storage facility. A very bright luminous amber spere was observed from the second story of our home. It was traveling East, just above tree top level and although the distance was difficult to judge because the size is unknown my wife and I both got the impression it was fairly close (50 - 300 yards away). We opened the window and could hear no noise. The sky was overcast but the object was well below the level of the clouds. The object was perfectly round or spherical but appeared to have very small spikes or rays around the edge. It moved behind trees and we could no longer observe it.;35.0438;-106.3024
