UFO over Sandia Mountains;2010-05-01 23:00:00;5 min.;UFO over Sandia Mountains I saw a circle that I thought was a star.  It shined brightly, and pulsated, however, only white light that I could see.  I realized that the star was too low, compared to others in the night sky.  The sky was clear, with a few clouds.  The circle was over a house (at least it appeared to be) and was low in the sky.  I took out my binoculars and looked at the object, which glowed, then slightly dimmed.  I saw no aircraft lights, and it did not move from side to side, but appeared to hover over the home.  I called my daughter and my son to look at it.  They came out, and we were watching it, when it disappeared.  It was there and then was gone.  I have never seen anything like it.  Can someone tell me if there was any experimental aircraft in the area?  I know the base is nearby.  It was just crazy, because I keept looking for it after it disappeared, but didn't see it again.;35.0438;-106.3024
