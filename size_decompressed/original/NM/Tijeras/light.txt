Red lights in the southern New Mexico sky multiplying and disappearing.;2015-06-30 20:30:00;15-20 seconds;Red lights in the southern New Mexico sky multiplying and disappearing. Around 23:00 I was driving home from work.  In the southern sky, I noticed a bright red dot.  A few seconds later the red dot shot out an equal in size and color dot.  The second dot then shot back into the first with speed.  After that, two dots shot out totalling three dots in the southern sky.  Similarly the two dots shot back in to form only one dot.  Lastly, three dots shot out totalling four dots in the night sky.  One dot disappeared and the remaining formed together one last time and disappeared at the same time. I kept observing the sky through the remainder of my drive, and as I turned onto the road that leads to my house, I noticed two red dots in the southern sky that formed together and disappeared.   When I got home, my brother rushed outside to tell me he had seen the same exact thing.;35.0438;-106.3024
