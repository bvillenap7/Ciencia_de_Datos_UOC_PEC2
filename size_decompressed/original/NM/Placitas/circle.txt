Revolving lights in clouds over village of Placitas.  ((NUFORC Note:  Advertising lights??  PD));2016-07-01 23:30:00;still happening;Revolving lights in clouds over village of Placitas.   it's a cloudy night.  i stepped out on my patio before going to bed. out of the corner of my eye i noticed a series of lights up in the clouds going by.  my first thought was headlights on a distant road reflecting off the cloud cover.  but it continued at regular intervals.  as i really started watching, i realized the lights were going in a large circle, over and over again. this thing seems to be stationary and concealed in the clouds-except for the lights.  it is still sitting there-i'm home alone and pretty freaked out.
