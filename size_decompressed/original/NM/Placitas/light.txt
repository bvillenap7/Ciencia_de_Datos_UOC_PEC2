Very large star like object dropped three smaller bright objects.;2009-09-20 06:00:00;30 minutes;Very large star like object dropped three smaller bright objects. While walking eastward on morning of 9/20/09 @6am there was a second star just to the west of the morning star, only it was about 5 times brighter and bigger. I watched for about 20 minutes then a small bright object began dropping below the light. After a couple minutes a second bright object began dropping but at a greater speed, catching up with the first object. Then a third object began dropping. At this time the large bright object deflated to about the size and brightness of the morning star to the right(east). By this time(6:30am) the rising sun gradually over whelmed the shine of the objects and the morning star.;35.3092;-106.5293
Satellites don't normally follow one right after another on the same path or seem to move that fast.;2014-02-03 20:00:00;20 seconds;Satellites don't normally follow one right after another on the same path or seem to move that fast. Saw what we thought was a satellite, bright light traveling very fast approx north to south.   Visible for almost 80 degrees of the sky, almost directly overhead and just west/above Orion.  It was followed by a second high speed light we assume was also a satellite in the exact same path about 15 seconds later.  Then, about 5 seconds later, there was a THIRD light traveling at the same high rate of speed, but following a west to east track that crossed the path of the first two.  The path actually crossed through Orion's belt before it faded out.  I've seen a lot of satellites, but I've never seen them so bright, so fast, or visible for so long.
