Flashing Lights Surround MY PU TRU:CK;1988-09-01 21:00:00;uncertain;Flashing Lights Surround MY PU TRU:CK   After leaving ABQ Int'l Airport to see my two young sons off on a flight back to Wisconsin I stopped at a Mexican Restaurant in Vaughn to eat dinner.   Then leaving the Restaurant just as it was getting dark for some reason I left the road, might have dozed off as it was a long drive to ABQ from Roswell where they had stayed with me for a month during summer vacationl.   Somehow, I woke up surrounded by flashing green, red, yellow lights that seemed to be spinning around my car.  I drove back onto 285 and continued on to Roswell and home!   Only reason I am reporting this I noticed the entry dated March 2 for Vaughn which sighting occurred in Feb of 2008.   I decided to write this in hopes that their report gains credence.  I think the lights woke me up.  I also lost sometime on this trip since I got home very late around 23:00 or later. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD));34.6241;-105.1926
