Single bright pink low &quotcloud&quot when still dark before sunrise.;2015-02-25 00:00:00;~30 minutes;Single bright pink low &quotcloud&quot when still dark before sunrise I'm not sure what this actually was...  Also couldn't put time above, but it was 5:45 am when I noticed this...   there was a fairly large, low hanging, club-shaped cloud about 1 mi. S of our house which is 3 mi. S of Moriarty, NM.  It was bright medium pink.  The sun hadn't even come up enough over the horizon yet to light the edges of a cloud bank far E of my location. Weather at the time is very clear, cold, occasional breeze, except for the pink cloud and the cloud bank far distant to the E. Cloud appears nearly motionless.  It was fairly dissipated by 6:20 am, and had barely moved in a NW direction.  I've lived all over the US and I've seen plenty of crazy weather anomalies and this cloud WAS NOT RIGHT.  I even got my friends son to come look at it.  He looked around at the sky (to see if there was something worth noting) looked back at the cloud and agreed it was a strange shade of pink.   I had no way to take a picture unfortunately.  As a side-note there have also been issues with weird lights at night that were frequent around September last year but have tapered off to 1-2 times a month.  They appear to be terrestrial or just above the ground. Between the lights and this freaky cloud I figured I should report something.;34.9889;-106.0609
