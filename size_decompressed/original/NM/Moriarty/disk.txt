UFO seen in broad daylight near Golden;2019-02-16 14:00:00;5 minutes;UFO seen in broad daylight near Golden Looked outside of bedroom window which faces toward the North and noticed that there was an object in the sky.  At first, I believed it to just be an airplane since the town of Moriarty has one, but it wasn't over that far to be that.  Nor was it a piece of trash (clearly too big) and definitely not a weather balloon as it was moving sideways and I could actually see the colors from the sun shifting, on I am assuming, the silver object as it reflected. I watched it for all of five minutes before it disappeared into a dark cloud as it looked as if a storm was brew whether rain or snow, I don't know.   But I did wait to see if it reappeared, but it did not.;34.9889;-106.0609
