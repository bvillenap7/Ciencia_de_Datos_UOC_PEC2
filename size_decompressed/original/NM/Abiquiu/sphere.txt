Blue orb crosses sky near Abiquiu;2021-06-12 21:30:00;15 seconds;Blue orb crosses sky near Abiquiu On Saturday, June 12, 2021 at about 9:30 PM (about 30 minutes to an hour after sunset), while camped at the Corps of Engineers campground at Lake Abiquiu, NM, and facing north at Camp Site 36, I saw a royal blue orb moving from the middle of the sky to the north until it reached the hills toward the town of Abiquiu. Once it reached the hills, it adjusted its trajectory, rose above the hills and disappeared from view. The speed seemed about the same as a typical aircraft. The size was larger than a typical aircraftâ€”perhaps 20 percent of the size of the typical full moon.;36.1769;-106.2449
