Red, Blue, and Bright White Hovering Crafts over the East Mesa in Velarde, NM.  ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling stars?  PD));2012-10-15 22:00:00;all night;Red, Blue, and Bright White Hovering Crafts over the East Mesa in Velarde, NM I have seen flashing, silent, hovering lights over the East Mesa over the Velarde River Valley. This has been a nightly phenomenon for at least 6 months now.  Because it is so dark, I can not make out any shape.  Every night I go outside, I see at least one or two hovering crafts. They are completely silent and flash red, blue, and red lights.  They do not move and I will go outside around 10:00 pm and if I'm still awake, I will go outside around 2:00 or 3:00 am and they are still there!   Helicopters fly over our canyon often, and we can always hear them, but these &quotcrafts&quot are silent.;36.1574;-105.9788
