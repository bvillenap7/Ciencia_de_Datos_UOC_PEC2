Black Triangular Craft Emits Buzzing Sounds.;2002-04-01 12:00:00;3 mins;Black Triangular Craft Emits Buzzing Sounds. I worked for a local electric utility company and I was laying out a new route for a powerline when I heard a loud buzzing sound. It sounded like hundred of Bees Buzzing was above me. The sound was so loud that I thought that I was near a bee hive. I looked around an I seen a Black triangular object hovering above me. It was moving slow from the south to north. I imagine that it was about 1/4 mile above me. There were clouds in the sky but it didn't interfer with the object. There were no lights and the object looked flat black. I know what the 60Hz hum from our substations sound like, and this oject sounded like bees. There is a distinct sound fom bees and 60 Hz hum. It moved across the sky and it was gone. North of Hwy 574. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));36.7998;-108.0805
