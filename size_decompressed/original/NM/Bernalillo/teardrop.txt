Pearlescent, teardrop object stationary in sky for two hours, turns red and disappears at night fall;2009-09-19 17:15:00;2 hrs. 15 min.;Pearlescent, teardrop object stationary in sky for two hours, turns red and disappears at night fall My husband, two children, and myself were vacationing in New Mexico Thu-Sun and got pics from outside of our hotel on Saturday.  They all show the same object, something stationary in the sky from about 5:15-7:30 p.m.    At first, we thought it may be a balloon since it is NM.   We were walking into our hotel and saw this and decided to go back to the car and grab the binoculars.  Using them, we could see that it wasn't a hot air balloon.  It was silvery/pearly white, teardrop shape, but no basket on the bottom.  The inside was dark grey-black, like a small circle in the middle.  It wasn't moving.  There also wasn't a string or thing on the bottom showing that it was a weather balloon, either.  I took a few pictures from outside the hotel (you can see the billboard in the pics). We went up to our room and sat in the window seat to get a better look.  It still hadn't moved, but clouds started coming across it.  Then clouds settled in, so we stopped looking and ate dinner.   We decided to go for a sunset drive by our hotel and into the foothills.  Sure enough, when the clouds parted, it was still there.  At this time, the black area inside of it started to turn orange/red.   By the time dusk turned to night, it started to fade and was gone completely.  All in all, for 2 hours, it didn't move left or right, up or down.  Considering this, its design, and strange behavior, we decided that it couldn't be a weather balloon.  If you zoom into the pics, you can get a better view.;35.3287;-106.5386
