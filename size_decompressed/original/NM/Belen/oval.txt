Intense glowing object changing colors;2003-09-19 18:50:00;1 1/2 hour;((NUFORC Note:  I suspect that a twinkling star is the first possible explanation that would have to be ruled out.  PD)) Intense glowing object changing colors While driving south on I-25 from albuquerque area to home in Belen, My husband and I witnessed a very intense glowing object southwest of Belen area. Several other vehicles were pulled over the side of the road, obviously observing the same object as we were. We drove to our home and was able to visualize the glowing object for at least an hour. The object apeared to just slightly move in the sky with no dramatic movements and changed color from bright glowing white to intense red in color then back to white again then finally to red. Then object diminished in sky. Sighting lasting approx a little over an hour. Neighborhood teenagers stating the object swayed several times during the hour. Object approx 3/4 mile away ( not quite sure on the distance against the sky ). One jet and one small perhaps cesna flew towards the object and the object did not move. I did not have a camera available and wished I had. But recently heard that channel 7 news did a story on this.;34.6511;-106.6952

I live in belen and see them all around the city.  They look like stars except they hang down low and blink and if you look through binoculars you see the colors, red white blue green and sometimes orange.   Lately they've been on the westside, four of them.  Look And see.;34.6511;-106.6952
