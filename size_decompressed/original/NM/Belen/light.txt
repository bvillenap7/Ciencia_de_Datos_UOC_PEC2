Mass sighting after flashing headlights at main UFO.;1998-09-15 23:00:00;15 minutes;Mass sighting after flashing headlights at main UFO. On a clear moonless night, a friend and I were out driving around when we decided to pull off of the road and watch the stars.  We pulled onto a very large flat area near Belen, NM called Tierra Grande, which is a vast treeless flat plain that then sharply rises up to 10,000 ft.+ to the Manzano Mountains.  As we were sitting there, we noticed a very large, bright white light, flying up and down the side of the mountain.  We could see the light almost touch the ground and then back up again.  At first we thought it was a helicopter, but the speed of the object and the fact that I had hiked the area many times and knew there was not room for a helicopter down in the canyons and foothills of JFK Park.  We could make out the outline of pine trees as the large orb flew quickly over the park.  After about 5 min. of this, the light disappeared and we waited for it to return, I suggested that my friend flash his headlights three times.  Immediately, and I mean instantly, 15 to 20 orbs lit up exactly at the same time all over the mountain side.  As I know the area very well, I know that the terrain is extremely steep, and there is no way these light s could have been campers or hikers, no trails, no campgrounds.  The lights were scattered down the mountain side for about 3-4 mile stretch and after flashing the lights on the car, they all came on instantly, simultaneously.  Eventually, all of the lights when off, one by one after about 10 min..  I called the police to see if anyone else had see the lights and they laughed and said Um, no  We never saw any of the lights again.;34.6511;-106.6952
