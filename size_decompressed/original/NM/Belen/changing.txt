My unc;2019-06-22 22:30:00;2 minutes;I was the passenger in a car, in the back seat on the passengers side.  We were driving south on I-25.  Our destination was Belen.  My uncle was driving and my aunt was in the front passenger's seat.  The night was very dark and what I saw took place over the west mesa of Belen, close to the second freeway exit.  I first saw what looked like a white ball of light explode followed by a tail of white light, then it was gone.   A few seconds later, I saw what looked like 4 large, bright white headlights set very close together. There was dim light coming from underneath the 4 bright lights.  The lights were facing east, facing the freeway.   I mentioned the lights to my aunt.  We were trying to determine what it could be.  The lights appeared to be stationary and continued facing us.  We then saw two of the bright lights turn north facing the other 2 lights but they remained very close together.  Then, the lights went back to facing the same eastern direction.   We continued driving south and we eventually lost sight of them, because the lights never moved.;34.6511;-106.6952
