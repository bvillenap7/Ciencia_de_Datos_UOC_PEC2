A non-metered flashing light of oscillating intensity and varied trajectory, with inconstant speed.;2018-03-21 22:50:00;4 minutes;A non-metered flashing light of oscillating intensity and varied trajectory, with inconstant speed. AT 20:50 to approximately 20:54 mountain time, I looked towards the north sky and a flashing light caught my attention.  I proceeded to watch it for about 60 seconds, before I knocked on the window to call my wife outside. Still looking to the north I pointed at the sky to my wife and she started to track the same flashing light.  The light had an ebb and a flow to it, sometimes flashing brilliantly and other times more like an aircraft collision light through some haze. I stepped into the yard to land mark the Big Dipper so I could reference some trajectory.  I found it a bit further north and west than the north star, a third of the distance past the north star to the big dipper in distance.  In the next four minutes it shifted closer than the north star and further east of it at an approximate degree shift of 25 to 30 degrees. During one of the blinks I saw it shift nearly 5 degrees in the sky before that particularly bright prolonged flash ended.  The flashes metered 2-6 seconds in interval, and only lasted a second or two per flash.  The flashes lacked an exact meter of interval. The movement was mostly left to right which is  West to East.  Sometimes the object blinked stationary.  Other times it would move several degrees East South East. The type of light emission ranged between a super bright star to a dim star.
