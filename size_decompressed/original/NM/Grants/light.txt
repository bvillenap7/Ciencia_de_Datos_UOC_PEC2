bright light travelling normal speed stops above us for minutes then shoots off in nighttime NM sky.;1991-05-05 20:30:00;2 minutes;bright light travelling normal speed stops above us for minutes then shoots off in nighttime NM sky. All three car passengers stepped out for a stretcher and look at stars as the night was dark and the stars seemed very clear.  We had been travelling on state road 117 southbound and south of interstate 40.  Our approximate location could put us west near the Acoma Indian Reservation on the El Malpais National Monument and Conservation Area. We all saw a bright light which grabbed our attention and all affirmed to see and follow this bright light, brighter than stars.  The light was travelling north and stopped over us. The light stopped there for awhile, scaring us. The light then shot west and an incredible speed such as a laser pointer light would do.  We apprearently lost time and found ourselves on Road 117 remembering that we took road 53 when leaving I-40.  We got lost and ended up in Fence Lake NM the following morning where we had to wait for the country store to open to purchase fuel to finish our road trip. Local newspapers said it was a weather balloon but balloons don't maneauver like that. ((NUFORC Note:  Date above may be approximate, although the witness indicates that it is exact.
