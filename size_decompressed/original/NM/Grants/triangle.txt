Triangular, soundless UFO observed in Grants, NM during blood moon eclipse event.;2014-04-15 01:15:00;1 minute;Triangular, soundless UFO observed in Grants, NM during &quotblood moon&quot eclipse event. On April 16, I went to my back yard to observe the blood moon eclipse event.  ((sic.  April 15, 2014))   While observing, I noticed a strange craft fly overhead moving slowly, blacked out with no sound at all, from south to north towards Mt Taylor.  It seemed to be about the size of a house, triangular In shape - altitude approx. 500 feet.  No lights except the moon reflecting somewhat off of it.  Very strange! I'm still shaken!  There's something weird going on out there! ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) This object, when it first caught my eye appeared to me to be a flock of birds flying in formation such as geese do but as it approached I knew it was not. The light that I was seeing was the moon glistening off of the object. It moved slowly at about 30-40 mph as far as I could tell.  As I stated in my report it seemed to be about the size of a house.  If it was to fly in front of the moon at the time it would have easily covered it.  It made no noise and that is what was unusual and it spooked me. It also had no lights of any kind...just like a shadow in the air.   I observed it for 15 - 30 seconds and as it went over my house towards Mt. Taylor I couldn't or didn't want to follow it.  Yes it was Tuesday early 1:15 -1:20 am. No pics as it was too dark for my phone to capture image. ((END ADDENDUM));35.1518;-107.8575
