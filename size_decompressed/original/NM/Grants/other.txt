Large C-shaped craft slowed & angled off, followed minutes later by 4 jets.;2012-12-07 20:15:00;2-3 minutes;Large C-shaped craft slowed & angled off, followed minutes later by 4 jets Tonight, December 7, 2012 at approximately 2015, I was traveling east on Interstate 40 coming into Grants, NM.  I crested a hill with a panoramic view and saw a large C-shaped object traveling at a high rate of speed.  It appeared to slow, turn on its side and completely shift direction.  It had blue-green burn aura like a meteor in the first sighting before it slowed, giving it the appearance of space junk burning up in the atmosphere. After I lost sight of it in the dark I saw two jets approach in formation from one side following its trajectory, followed shortly by two more jets on a different approach..
