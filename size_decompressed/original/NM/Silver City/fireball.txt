Something explodes in the skies over Silver City, New Mexico;2004-01-21 23:40:00;2 minutes ?;Something explodes in the skies over Silver City, New Mexico At 23:40 hours on the night of 1/21/2004. Thursday, a blue/red meteor? or some kind of object exploded over the area from Silver City eastward to the village of Santa Clara, New Mexico. We live in Pinos Altos, New Mexico some six miles from Silver City at 7,040 feet on the continental divide.  The flash could be seen lighting up the trees, and the impact of whatever exploded shook our trailer with at least four distinct sounds of an impact.  We listened to our scanner as reports came in from the entire area inundating 911. There were reports that fragments hit at least two yards of residences in the area and probably more.  One distinct report over the sheriff's frequency was that a lady reported that a meteor fragment had hit her back yard. We contacted the sheriffs dept. and they varified the reports.  We will send updates on this incident as soon as possible. Very unusual.   ((name deleted));32.7855857142857;-108.265114285714
