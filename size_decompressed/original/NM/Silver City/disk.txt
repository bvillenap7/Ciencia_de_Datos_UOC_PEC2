Dark red Saucer follows Military aircraft.;2007-03-05 19:40:00;2 to 3 sec.;Dark red Saucer follows Military aircraft. I was outside walking my dog at approx 7:40 local Mountain Standard Time.  I noticed a large multi-engioned turbo proped aircraft (possibly a C-130 transport), as that is the most frequent type seen around here.  The aircraft came in from the Northeast of town, circled around the north of town to the west of town and then went to the South-South West.  I followed the aircraft until it got approximately 5 miles to the South-West, when something caught my eye, above and to the south.  There was a dim flash of light, followed by what appeared to be a disk type of craft suddenly appearing.  All the edges of the craft appeared as though they were imbedded in clouds, although the night was cloudless.  I could briefly see lines and a circle around the center of the of the bottom of the craft.  It exhibted a color of burnt orange, which I later discovered was the reflection of the lights of the city.  It was about the size of a nickle held at arms length.  It suddenly started to move, and started to fade out of sight and moved toward and followed the aircraft to the South.  It is interesting to note that on the day before (Sunday) an AWACS E-3 airbourn radar aircraft orbited around this city for approx. 4 hours.  This is VERY unusual because Military aircraft don't fly around here on the weekends!  It was as if they were looking for something!!!   In the past few months, I have witnessed craft landing to the North-West up in the Mountains, usually during the week, not on the week-ends.  I will keep my eyes open, monitor my Scanners and watch the sky.  If I see something more, I will let you know asap.;32.7855857142857;-108.265114285714
