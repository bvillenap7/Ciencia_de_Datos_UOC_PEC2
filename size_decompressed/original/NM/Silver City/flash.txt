Very faint flashing strobe.;2006-10-16 21:05:00;15 minutes;Very faint flashing strobe At approximately 905 PM, Mountain Standard Time, I was on our front porch scanning the sky to the west, 270 degrees, with a pair of 7x50 binoculars when into my view appeared a faint flashing object.  It appeared to be a single flashing strobe, flashing three times, then with about a one second pause.  It was first seen at about a 15 degree angle moving directly East. While I was watching it, it suddenly turned to the North-East.  I couldn't see this objet with my unaided eye, only with the binoculars.  It appeared to be very high in the sky and moving at a rapid clip, but slower than the many satellites that we see every night.  I witnessed this light travel across the night sky moving North-East until it moved into the Milky Way, then it blinked off and I lost it at approximately 21:20 (9:20 PM MST).  I saw three comercial aircraft to the south of our location at the same time, but highly doubt any of them witnessed this sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, as we have done in the past, and we suspect that the report is quite accurate.  We do not know what the witnesses observed.
