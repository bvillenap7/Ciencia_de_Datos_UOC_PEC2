the object had no nav. light and moved about in a strange pattern;1997-06-15 23:00:00;30 seconds;the object had no nav. light and moved about in a strange pattern We were ar Bear Mountain Lodge near Silver City NM.  We were in an open field, no moon, so dark you could not see where you were walking. At the time I had a Starlight Scope with an attached IR light.  As I looked around through the scope, I could see animal eyes, deer, coyotes, rabits, etc., glowing in the dark from the IR light source.  Then I decided to look up into the moonless night sky.  I turned off the IR. Now and then I could see an airliner moving high overhead.  To idintify the airliner, I looked at it with the Starlight Scope (2.5 X) and then noticed I could see the flashing nav. light.  Without the scope it was difficult to see the flashing nav. light. A few minutes later, almost straight overhead I noticed another dot of light moving west.  When I examined this light there was no flashing nav. light.  At first I thought it was a satilite, however, the dot of light changed direction and proceeded somewhat south then east, then back west to a point about 50 degrees off the horizon. I constantly checked this dot with my Starlight Scope and still no flashing nav. light. The dot of light then remained locked in position with the stars and slowly dimmed out.  I belive the object became dim because it was moving away from earth. Conclusion:  This has to be a UFO in the true meaning of the word.  It was not an airliner nor a satilite.
