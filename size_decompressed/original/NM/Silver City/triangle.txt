Trangular shaped translucent object with lights;2001-12-01 21:15:00;1 minute;Trangular shaped translucent object with lights While driving east toward Silver City, my wife, son and I observed what appeared to be a large triangular shaped object moving rapidly in a north-northeast direction.  To me, the triangle seemed to be translucent orange/yellow.  The peak of the triangle appeared to be up and at the peak was a bright light shining to the rear.  There was another light at roughly the lower right corner of the triangle.  We think this light was blinking. As for size, I would guess 1 to 2 moon diameters, maybe more.  We lost sight of it for a few seconds and when we saw it again, it was disappearing behind a line of mountains to the east of Silver City.
