Metallic orange lights over mountains Silver City, New Mexico;2004-08-23 21:00:00;30 MINUTES;Metallic orange lights over mountains Silver City, New Mexico At 2100 HRS.8/23/2004 , my brother and I witnessed two brilliant orange metallic lights side-by-side over the Silver City range of mountains to the west of Silver City, New Mexico.  We are at an altitude of 6,000 feet and the lights were higher and just to the west of the mountains. Looking through binoculars the lights were solid with no other lights in,on,or around them. The two lights behaved like the Phoenix lights, fading in and out for some thirty minutes and appeared in three locations. (I have seen the Phoenix lights).  There were aircraft in the vicinity.  The lights did not behave like flares.  The night was partially cloudy,stars visible and the almost first half of the moon. We will continue to watch.;32.7855857142857;-108.265114285714
bright object emits spherical cloud like something out of WAR OF THE WORLDS.;2005-09-22 20:43:00;8TO 9 SECONDS;bright object emits spherical cloud like something out of WAR OF THE WORLDS. At 20:43 hrs. we saw a bright light that literally began to form a large perfect bubble of light expanding from some point to the west of the Silver City Mountains. As the luminous cloud began to expand (white in color with orange) we saw an object heading straight south at a perfect horizontal line with this cloud emission coming out of the end.  The light which had a strobe or red light on it quickly disappeared to the south.  The cloud grew into a perfect sphere like the blisters around the crafts in WAR OF THE WORLDS. Then the cloud disipated. We immediately called 911 and within minutes they reported that the FAA said it was a missile fired from Vandenberg. However, I have seen missiles launched and this did not fit the pattern.  We could see the object and the cloud, no contrail, just this wierd cloud that looked nuclear. I was afraid that it might have been just that. But it wasn't.  I do always trust what the government reports.  I have seen missile launches from White Sands and this looked different.  Any comments???????;32.7855857142857;-108.265114285714
Daytime sighting of white star-like objects that moved in formations and also had the ability to suspend themselves motionless.;2005-10-22 15:00:00;20 minutes;Daytime sighting of white star-like objects that moved in formations and also had the ability to suspend themselves motionless. I was out in the front of my house on Saturday afternoon, 10/22/05, when I heard a jet go over and I looked up to see where it was.   I live on two private acres on the outskirts of Silver City, NM.   The jet had broken the sound barrier and was way out of sight, it was long gone - I never did see it.   However, the more I looked at the sky I began to see something else come into focus.  Straight up, and directly above my head, I saw what appeared to be no more than just a white object - just a white point of light.  It hung motionless.  The object looked kind of like what a very bright star might look like during the middle of the day, and it appeared to be very, very high up, but I had nothing to relate size to, so I can't exactly gauge altitude.   The sky was clear and bright blue, and it was between 3:30 and 4:00 (MST)in the afternoon.   The more my eyes became accustomed to the sky I realized another identical object to the right of the one I had been looking at.  It also appeared motionless.  On further observation I soon located a third identical white object above the two I was looking at, and the three of them together formed a triangle.   They remained completely suspended for several minutes and did not move.  They were all, in fact, stationary when I first located them.   Suddenly the two objects which flanked the middle one fanned out to form what was now an arc.  This was the first movement I witnessed.  Their movements were sudden for having been suspended for so long.   Once they had formed an arc formation they once again quit movement and suspended themselves again.  They were all equally spaced in this formation.   After a couple more minutes I noticed a fourth identical object coming out of the southeast at a very high rate of speed.  It approached the middle object in the arc formation and suddenly came to a very quick stop next to it.  It looked as if it was going to bump the middle object.  In fact, I have described the fourth object as racing in and flirting or dancing with the other object.  It would approach it as if it was going to bump it and then it would back off and repeat the motion.   Suddenly the two other white objects, which had remained stationary all this time in their formation, fanned out again, but this time to line up in a perfectly straight line with the middle object which was still being taunted by the fourth object.  Once the three lined up they suddenly started moving northwest at a consistant speed and evenly spaced.  During the duration none of these objects ever changed shape or color.   Soon the original three were gone over the horizon.  The fourth white point (object) remained suspended where it had been when the others left it.  After a few minutes it began to slowly move in the same northwest direction as the others.  I watched it move quite a distance, much more and it would have disappeared over the horizon like the others, and then it suddenly stopped and suspended itself again.   Coming out of the southeast was a fifth identical white object also traveling at a very fast speed.  It was headed directly for the straggler, the fourth object, which remained motionless.  Again, this object seemed to dance with the other object once it got close to it.  It went through the same taunting motions, and would make passes at the other object, looking almost like it was going to hit it.   After a minute or so of this activity the fifth and newest object proceeded alone on the same northwest course as the others.  The straggler remained suspended for a few more minutes before it too resumed the same northwest direction.    The full experience of what I have just described took place over about a 20 minute time period. I have checked our local news and have talked to a few people around town and no one has made mention of seeing anything like this.  I would be more than interested in knowing if there is anyone in my vicinity who may have witnessed the same thing I did.   I have never seen anything like it, nor can I think of anything that we know of that would act in such a manner in space.   This is my first sighting.;32.7855857142857;-108.265114285714
UFO over Silver City, New Mexico at very low altitude.;2006-10-01 23:00:00;3 minutes;UFO over Silver City, New Mexico at very low altitude The blue/white light flew silently  in from the south at a VERY LOW ALTITUDE of say about 200 feet or less, right straight over Silver City, New Mexico heading north. There was absolutely NO SOUND OF ANY KIND AND NO AIRCRAFT LIGHTS OF ANY KIND and as it flew lower to the north we could see that it was some kind of craft as the structure of the craft partially blocked out the blue white light.  It must have landed somewhere to the north. We could clearly see the object was well below the surrounding mountain ranges.  Nothing ever took off.  The great Gila Wilderness lies to the north.  Silver City sets in a valley.  DEFINTELY NOT A METEOR, SPACE JUNK, OR AIRCRAFT THAT WE KNOW OF.  It flew fast in and slowed down as it passed low over the city and then appeared to land somewhere to the north, which is rugged country.  The next morning, KOAT TV reported that there were sightings of lights in Albuquerque and  last night, Art Bell said that he was receiving reports of some kind of lights seen in Washington state. SOMETHING IS HAPPENING AND IT IS NOT WHAT THE AUTHORITIES ARE TELLING US!!!!!!!;32.7855857142857;-108.265114285714
Intensely bright, slow-moving, star-like object that grew even brighter before it suddenly disappeared.;2010-08-03 21:00:00;1 minute;Intensely bright, slow-moving, star-like object that grew even brighter before it suddenly disappeared. I am a star-gazer, and love to sit out on my porch steps at night watching the stars.  I am quite accustomed to seeing satelites, shooting stars and assorted aircraft, but last night was different.  I live outside of town and am very secluded.  The nights are gorgeous since there is no light polution.   I sat outside for about half an hour and was able to track several satelites.  I had just finished tracking my last satelite, watching it disappear above me over my house.  I immediately dropped my eyes back down to the horizon, looking southeast.  There is a large hill in front of where I live and it is covered in small pine.   Suddenly above the treeline appeared what I first thought was a star.  It hadn't been there a minute before.  It shown intensely bright, and I could not figure out what star, at that intense a magnitude, would be coming up in that place at that time.  It was way brighter than anything else in the sky.  I continued to think it was a very! bright star when I suddenly realized it was moving very, very slowly.  Then I got excited and thought perhaps I was looking at the ISS.  I have no idea how high it was, and there was no noise connected to it.   I watched it for about a minute as it traveled about the length of my hand - if I were to extend my arm.  It suddenly stopped, unlike anything I have ever seen.  It hung motionless and grew even more intense in its brightness, and then began to slowly dim until it became just a pin point of light, and disappeared.   The only way I can describe the object is that of a very bright, white light - like a huge star.  I have never seen anything act that way.  I would be curious to know if anyone else saw the same thing.;32.7855857142857;-108.265114285714
Two bright stars that moved and disappeared into the northern sky at dusk in New Mexico.;2014-04-28 20:30:00;2 minutes;Two bright stars that moved and disappeared into the northern sky at dusk in New Mexico. I saw a star type object in the northeast sky that was moving north and thought it was an aircraft without a blinking light.  It simply disappeared after about 20 seconds.   I kept watching the area and saw another, coming from a slightly different area that also moved toward the north and disappeared as well.   These looked like very bright stars but it wasn't late enough for the normal stars to be seen as brightly, that is why I thought it was an airplane but I have never seen an airplane disappear, or not have blinking lights.;32.7855857142857;-108.265114285714
Bright, very red, light flies south to west near Silver City, NM.;2014-09-14 21:03:00;2 minutes;Bright, very red, light flies south to west near Silver City, NM. Saw a bright, very red light approaching from the south, heading northwest toward the west - as if coming from Deming or Las Cruces and heading to Phoenix.   It appeared to fly at about helicopter height and helicopter speed, but it made no noise and appeared only as a very bright, very red, unblinking light.  The orangey-red or red color was pure with no other colors noted.   It was at least twice the size that Venus appears, possibly more.   It was visible for 90 seconds or more.   The two witnesses are unsure whether it flew in a perfectly straight line, or whether it flew first toward the city in a more northerly direction, and then arced westward when it approached, or was over Boston Hill south of Silver City.   Video was taken, but was hand-held and not very useful.;32.7855857142857;-108.265114285714
