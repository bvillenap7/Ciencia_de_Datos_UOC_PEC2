2 ufo sightings silver city new mexico July 12, 2006;2006-07-12 05:15:00;30 minutes;2 ufo sightings silver city new mexico July 12, 2006 My husband was leaving for work with his friend, when I herd his friend yelling at him over and over. I couldn't figure out what was going on. I got out of bed and headed into the livingroom, when my husband came in the house yelling for me to come outside. There was a bright formation in the sky with bright colors. His firend said  he saw an object come from a distance in the sky. It moved forward quickly, then moved in another direction then it was gone. Leaving behing a very weird shape and colors. During all of this, I had went back into the house to get the kids, so they could see this amazing sight!! My husband and his friend left for work and I had told my son to go in the house and get my camera. My husband had gotten pictures of this sighting, but I wanted pictures also. While my son was in the house, my daughter and I were sitting outside still observing the sight, when a distance to the side of the sighting a bright light in the form of a circle appeared in the sky. It got bigger and bigger. It looked as tho the sky was opening up. My daughter and I were speachless!! Then all of the sudden smoke formed around the object and it moved forward then was gone. Leaving a smoke formation in the sky of a circle and a trail. These two sightings were got on picture by my husband and myself and nearby neighbors.;32.7855857142857;-108.265114285714
