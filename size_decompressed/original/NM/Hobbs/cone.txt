ufo came from thu8nderstorm;1981-07-30 19:30:00;1 1/2 min;ufo came from thu8nderstorm My brother and I traveled to Hobbs, N.M. from Lovington,N.M. after a line thunderstorm had passed through. When we got to our aunt's house ,it was early evening and the storms were producing a lot of beautiful lightining over Seminole,Tx,approximatly 30 mile to the east. I saw what I thought was an aircraft landing light coming from the direction of the storm.I commented to my brother how fast it seemed to be moving, I said this is going to be loud because it seemed to be moving at a high sub-sonic speed. It passed about 3/4 of a mile to our south with no sound. at our south it appeared to be triangle shaped( a red light on the nose and a green light on the tail)I still thought it was an aircraft until it passed another 20 degrees to the west. at that time it appeared that the back was a triangle but there were three lighits that followed eachother around the outside of the triangle. it quickly dis appeared beyond the roofs of the houses.
