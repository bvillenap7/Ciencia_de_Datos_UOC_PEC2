Three circular craft changing shape SW of Hobbs, NM;2014-04-05 18:30:00;1 minute;Three circular craft changing shape SW of Hobbs, NM Just got out of work with my friend at the school cafeteria at my college and seen these weird shapes in the sky.   They seemed to be changing shape but could not tell from what to what.   I zoomed in with my junk cell phone camera and snapped a pic.   It was just before sunset looking southwest from the NMJC campus.   It vanished and my buddy said it's gone.;32.726827027027;-103.129158108108
Three circular craft changing shape SW of Hobbs, NM.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible street lamps in front of Sun.  PD));2014-04-05 18:30:00;1 minutes;Three circular craft changing shape SW of Hobbs, NM. Just got out of work with my friend at the school cafeteria at my college and seen these weird shapes in the sky.   They seemed to be changing shape but could not tell from what to what.

Triangle shaped blinking red lights moving slowly in the northern sky.;2014-11-07 20:30:00;15 seconds;Triangle shaped blinking red lights moving slowly in the northern sky. I work at a gas plant between two small towns on the state line between southern New Mexico and Texas.  There is generally just two persons manning the plant during the night shift.  While making rounds I noticed what at first appeared to be a single flashing red light (like a typical radio tower light) to the north of my position. The light was unusual so I stopped the vehicle and watched it.  It was moving slowly in a westward direction toward town.  While I was watching, the light split into three lights making a perfect upright triangle.  The blinking frequency did not change.  There was a beam of light the same color and intensity of the corners of light connecting the three points. When this happened I called the other operator at the control room on the radio for him to go outside and look at what I was seeing.  As soon as he answered me the lights went back into one red light with white lights flashing beside it and appeared to be a normal airplane.  I told him to disregard, whatever it was was gone.;32.726827027027;-103.129158108108
