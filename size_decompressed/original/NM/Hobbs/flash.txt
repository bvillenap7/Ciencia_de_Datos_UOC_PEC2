Large Flash of Light observed from an FAA control tower in New Mexico.;1976-06-15 23:00:00;1 second;Large Flash of Light observed from an FAA control tower in New Mexico. In the summer of 1976 I was working the night shift as an air traffic controller at Lea County Control tower Hobbs, New Mexico.  It was a non-radar tower.  The weather was, ceiling unlimited and visibility unlimited.  A very clear clean air night.  I was in the control tower alone.  There was no air traffic in the area.  Around 23:00 I observed a flash of light that lit up everything for miles around.  It was like someone shot off a giant flash strobe from a very high altitude.  The entire landscape lit up like daylight. Around midnight another controller that was off duty came up to the tower with his girlfriend.  I started to tell him about the flash and he couldn't belive they saw the same thing at the same time.  However they were coming home from Cloudcroft and at the time of the flash they were below the caprock.  The caprock is a shelf of land about 30 miles west of the tower.  He had the same description that I had.  We talked about it and thought it could be something the U.S. Air Force was working on. ((FOLLOW-UP COMMUNICATION FROM WITNESS)) I just re-read your note and found that I did not answer all of your questions.  I was facing North in the control tower but the light lit up everything everywhere.  I lost touch with the other couple after the controller strike in 1981.  But they were driving East and would have been facing East.  They also said it lit up everything in every direction.  Hope this helps. ((END)) ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event is approximate.

I IMMEDIATELY LOOKED UP AND SAW THREE TO FOUR JETS FLYING OVER HEAD. I WATCHED FOR A FEW SECONDS WHILE THEY FLEW OFF. I THEN WENT INSIDE, WITH-IN A FEW MINUTES THE JETS WERE BACK AND I WENT BACK OUT TO WATCH. WHEN I LOOKED UP AND TO THE NORTH I SPOTTED TWO JETS FLYING REASONABLY CLOSE, WHEN SUDDENLY A STREAK WENT WHAT LOOKED LIKE BETWEEN THE TWO. I STOOD THERE FOR A BIT TO SEE IF ANY THING ELSE WOULD HAPPEN, I THEN NOTICED A COUPLE MORE JETS. THEY ALL DISAPPEARED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE STREAK.;32.726827027027;-103.129158108108
