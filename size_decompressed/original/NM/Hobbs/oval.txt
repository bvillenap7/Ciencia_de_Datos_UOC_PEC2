Very bright white oval shaped object seen outside an aircraft window over west Texas. ((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter.  PD));2012-09-22 07:38:00;30 minutes;Very bright white oval shaped object seen outside an aircraft window over west Texas.  At first I suspected it was Venus but ruled that out after noting the object’s changing placement in the sky from due North to the north east as the aircraft proceeded due west.  I also later confirmed it wasn’t Venus by looking up the hours Venus is viewable.  The object seemed 3 times brighter than Venus and seemed a few times larger as well. This sighting was from my United flight UA361 on 9/22/2013 from Austin, TX, to San Francisco.  Flight UA361 departed at approximately 6:26 AM CST from Austin and the first picture was taken at 7:38 AM which would be approximately 68 minutes into a 215 minute flight placing the aircraft somewhere between Midland Odessa and El Paso.  The object was viewed out my window of the north facing side of the aircraft. ((NUFORC Note:  We strongly suspect that the witness was looking at Jupiter.  PD));32.726827027027;-103.129158108108
