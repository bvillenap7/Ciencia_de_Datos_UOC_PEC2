I stepped outside just around 30 minutes ago, at approximately 9:54PM Mountain Time, when I looked out to the western/north western sky, I saw something. At first I thought it was just something reflecting lights like a cloud or something. But then I realized it wasn't a cloud, due to seeing other clouds in the area, plus I could see stars around this object. It was quite large, pear shape almost like a hot air balloon, but not quite. It had an orange glow. I could see stars in the same vicinity behind it so I knew there were no clouds covering the moon. It was bright. I saw the moon earlier this evening, about 30 minutes to an hour prior to this, and it was a crescent moon.  This object was much more rounded and large.  I looked down for a split second as I took a step forward to try and get a better look and the thing appeared as though it was just shrinking As if it were floating straight away, with no sound what so ever. I could still see the stars, and as it got smaller (further away) more stars appeared behind it, and no clouds were in that area. I don't know what it was, and I won't say it was a UFO, but it was definitely something weird floating in the sky that I could not explain. Very large, no sound, glowing orange and I watched the object shrink into nothing and completely disappear very quickly. It confused me and the more I went outside and looked around at the sky to see other objects in the sky in relation to where this thing was, the less I can explain what I saw!  This is my report and is honest and accurate to the best of my knowledge;32.726827027027;-103.129158108108
