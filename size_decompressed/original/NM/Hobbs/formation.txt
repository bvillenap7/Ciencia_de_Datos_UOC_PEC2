Group of metallic orbs or lights in daytime.;2014-09-01 13:00:00;5 minutes;Group of metallic orbs or lights in daytime Sky was very blue,no breeze.  I was laying on my back in pool staring at the sky when out of nowhere, I noticed a group of shiny metalic objects kind of orb shaped darting around very high in the sky, almost impossible to see if you were not staring at the sky.   I asked my daughter (she is 30 ) to lay on her back next to me and see if she could observe them.  She could not believe what she was seeing.   They were grouped together but moving around in different directions .We watched them and they seemed to get higher and just dissipate.   I have no clue what we witnessed.  The air was still, no breeze at all, they were so high in the sky they kind of looked like shooting stars in the daytime.;32.726827027027;-103.129158108108

The next day upon closer looking I noticed a streaking light slide in behind the tic-tac ufo and overtake it at very fast speed.  I also saw other flashing, streaking and blinking UFOâ€™s upon a closer look.  The clouds above and below the craft(s) were behaving strangely.   I posted it on YouTube today.  link...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNFzqPlCXsk;32.726827027027;-103.129158108108
