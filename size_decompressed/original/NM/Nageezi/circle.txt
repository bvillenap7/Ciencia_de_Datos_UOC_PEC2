In the early evening, approximately 8:30 p.m. on August 27th (sic. August 25th), 2017, my husband and I were driving down Hwy 550 in New Mexico.  We were close to Nageezi, looking for a place to park for the evening.   As we passed a section of the Hwy, as I was talking to my husband, he was driving, I could see that to the left side of the road a bright white light caught my attention.  It appeared that there were two strangers inside of a bright bubble type craft, sitting facing each other but as we drove by they looked directly at me.  Because I was sitting in the passenger's seat, I could only see a small amount of the craft.   I was definitely shocked. I waited a couple of minutes, and then asked my husband, Did you just see that?;36.1598;-107.7664
