A little over a year ago, my brother and I saw a pyramid shaped UFO outside my house.  We had just gotten home from spending the weekend at a friend’s house.  We were smoking a cigarette and when we were almost done smoking my brother said “what the hell is that?”  I looked around and immediately saw what got his attention.  There was a pyramid shaped UFO slowly descending from the sky.  It was about a football field away.  While it was descending it was shimmering like light over choppy water.  Initially my brother thought it was a black plastic bag stuck on a pole.  It descended behind a two story apartment building across the street from my house.  Only the pointy part of the UFO was now visible. It stopped descending and suddenly 2 bright lights shot out of the top.  The two lights moved very fast swirling in different directions.  This happened for so long that I was fixated on the swirling lights and noticed that the lights were moving in a grid pattern. Suddenly! the two lights stopped in place after 5 minutes of swirling.  After the two lights stopped, the UFO started slowly cartwheeling with the two lights fixed at that one point of the pyramid.  It cartwheeled past the building it was behind showing the whole UFO.  As it was cartwheeling, it was slowing becoming transparent.  It cartwheeled horizontally for half a football field, getting more transparent and disappeared.  We stared in its direction waiting for something to happen.  Nothing ever did.;35.5269;-106.3445
