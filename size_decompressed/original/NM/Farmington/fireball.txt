lg green fireball!;2001-02-20 01:15:00;1 minute;lg green fireball! My husband, daughter, and I werereturning home from Grand Junction, Colorado over Red Mountain Pass when we saw a huge greenish ball in the sky. It was not a meteor and gave the snow a greenish cast. It went behind Engineers Peak after travelling slowly to the southeast. I was so shocked I'm not sure of the duration of the sighting, but I do know that we saw no flames, etc. coming off of it ((NUFORC Note:  If the witnesses observed the object for 1 minute, it probably was not a meteor.  We would welcome other reports.  PD));36.7472361702127;-108.177323404255
