Large white and green object spotted for appx 1 hour.;1995-07-01 01:00:00;appx 1 hour;Large white and green object spotted for appx 1 hour. After getting off work at Wal-Mart me and three others were traveling along Apache Street.  When we came to the radio station on Apache we saw a huge cone shaped object floating above the station.  The illumination on the surrounding street was an intense white and green.  We were not the only people who saw it - someone was across the street making a call from a payphone and was watching it as well.  After roughly two minutes the object lifted into the sky and began to proceed northeast.  We followed it from Apache to Dustin to 30th to Main Street where we drove to the hill overlooking Farmington lake.  The object continued to hover across the sky before disappearing along the south side of Animas Valley. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));36.7472361702127;-108.177323404255
