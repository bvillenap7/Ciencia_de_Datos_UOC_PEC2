Slow moving yellow/orange colored lights above Crouch Mesa;1988-08-20 23:00:00;8 minutes;Slow moving yellow/orange colored lights above Crouch Mesa I was by myself, night fishing at Farmington lake for catfish. I was fishing from the east side of the dam.  I had been sitting for quite a while without a bite so I anchored my pole with rocks and walked up to the top of the dam to stretch my legs and look around.  I looked toward the south/southeast over crouch mesa and observed 6 lights that appeared to be hovering a few hundred feet above the mesa approximately 2 to 3 miles away.  The lights were yellow/orange, identical in color to sodium vapor street lights.  They were in a straight line, at the same altitude, and fairly evenly spaced.  The light on the left most side was much larger and brighter than the other 5, which were of the same brightness.  At first I thought that they could have been street lights, but I could clearly see the mesa top and the lights were much too high to be street lights.  I also thought that they could be helicopters, but there were no helicopter sounds.  As I watched, the large light moved east a short distance and stopped, then the smaller lights moved to catch up with the big light, one at a time. This caterpillar like movement continued for several minutes. The movements were short.  At the distance that they appeared to be from me, I would estimate each movement to be 200 to 300 yards with a 15 to 20 second interval between movements.  After approximately 8 minutes I decided to go back down to the water and check my pole.  A few minutes later I returned to the top of the dam and the lights were gone.

Saw what appeared to be two satellites flying in formation, but don't believe that objects were satellites or airplanes.;1997-06-29 23:45:00;3 minutes;Saw what appeared to be two satellites flying in formation, but don't believe that objects were satellites or airplanes. On June 29, 1997, I was parked approximately 3 miles north of town on a deserted oilfield road.  At the time, I was looking to the west at the Big Dipper when I noticed what appeared to be a satellite out of the corner of my eye, moving to the south.  The altitude was right for a satellite.  As I was about to dismiss the object as a satellite, I noticed another object trailing the first at the exact same speed, and in the same path.  The distance between the two objects had to be incredible.  As I watched these objects for a minute or so, the second object accelerated.  At the point the second object overtook the first, both objects were lost from view due to the city lights.;36.7472361702127;-108.177323404255
