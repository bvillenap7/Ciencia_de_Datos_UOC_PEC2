Weather ballon spotted over Farmington, New Mexico by many people.;2011-09-08 19:05:00;10-12 minutes;Weather ballon spotted over Farmington, New Mexico by many people. At 7:05 p.m. on September 8, 2011, we were coming out of a Walgreens Pharmacy in Farmington, New Mexico when we noticed a large shiney object in the northeast sky. We had 5 people including myself in our party. There were others coming out of the Walgreens that saw the object and watched it as well. We all made comments as to whether it was a planet or a ballooon. The object did not appear to move at all or moved very slowly. The next day, NASA arrived at the Farmington Airport and rented 4 wheel drive vechicles to go and retrieve a weather balloon.  I do not believe this was anything other than a weather balloon but I wanted to file this report in case others saw this as well.  Weather balloon launches are very common in that area.  Also, I doubt NASA would make a big deal or even comment on a weather balloon if it were anything else.;36.7472361702127;-108.177323404255
