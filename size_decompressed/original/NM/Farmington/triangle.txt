When I was 10 yrs old, me and two of my friends who were 12 and 13 were outside jumping on a trampoline i saw a bright light in the sky and told one of my friends look it is a ufo,  he said no its not its an airplane.   I was like okay so we continued jumping i seen the bright light again, and i responded again its a ufo my friend said no its a plane, then after a few minutes i saw the light again this time when i told my friends they were like hmmm.well if we see it again we will go in.   There was no next time.  Next thing you know there was this triangular object hovering over head,  with holes in the bottom and it was like steel looking and I can remember water droplets, then there is a time span that I don't remember.  I remember we were then in the house, hiding.   Me and my friends never spoke of the event again until 9 years later,  Everyone recalls the same thing.
