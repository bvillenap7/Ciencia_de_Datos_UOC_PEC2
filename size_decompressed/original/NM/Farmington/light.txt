It wasn't a pair of headlights, only one light, and far to intense in brightness.   When first noticed it was approx 2 miles behind me, it aproached me with great speed, within 1/4 mile of my truck in 1-2 sec.  The light was so white that it seemed blue. 40 yr old married female.

We contacted the flight tower in Farmington, NM right after the event and there were no dispruptions and he didnt really take us seriously. we would have reported the event sooner but we just found this website.  We checked the news to see what it was but all they said it was possibly a meteor or part of the spacestation.  We want an explanation as to what we saw, so if there is any information about this sighting and what it was we would like to know. How come no one has any photos I thought new mexico has some high tech stuff that tracks stuff in the sky.;36.7472361702127;-108.177323404255

Three lights that formed a triangle moving across clear skies.;2013-07-02 22:36:00;10 seconds;Three lights that formed a triangle moving across clear skies Stepping out to retrieve my phone from my vehicle I happen to notice three lights moving north high in the sky.  I figured them to be stars at first but quickly realized that stars do not move in this manner. The three lights formed a triangle and were moving at the same speed keeping an equal distance away from each other.  I observed the lights for a short period before they faded out all at the same time.;36.7472361702127;-108.177323404255
Bright Light traveling ESE, without a sound or blinking lights.;2014-10-26 19:20:00;15 seconds;Bright Light traveling ESE, without a sound or blinking lights. While watching the World Series between San Francisco and Kansas City, the boys were outside to see if their Grandpa needed help with anything, and they come back telling me about a light in the sky traveling southeast on Troy King Rd over the Farmington Airport without ANY sound or beacons flashing.   It's amazing just what-so-ever I was on the subject of crafts in the night skies of NW New Mexico.  It traveled about 15 seconds ESE, then the bright Object traveling disappeared.
