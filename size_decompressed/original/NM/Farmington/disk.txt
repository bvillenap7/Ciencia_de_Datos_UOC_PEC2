Strange saucer like object with red flashing lights decending slowly from moon;2009-11-06 21:45:00;4 to 5 minutes;Strange saucer like object with red flashing lights decending slowly from moon At 9:45pm in Farmington New Mexico a UFO was seen, first, above and slightly to the right of the moon.  Then disappeared and reappeared at the bottom left side of the moon. As we watched, it slowly started moving downward.  At a closer look you could see flashing red lights moving in a circular motion horizontally.  After a few minutes the object started to fade and eventually disappeared. When it was first noticed, it looked as if the light from the moon was being reflected off of the object.  It's shape was not very distinct, but appeared flat and round.  We have recently been interested by this subject and are not sure if this has played a role in our sighting.  Whether it was actually seen or just a hallucination is not determined between us but we both witnessed and described matching details to each other.
