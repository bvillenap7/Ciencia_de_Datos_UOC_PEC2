What was captured was what looks a ufo.  The object is smalller at the top then comes down, tapers out then is round on the bottom..  After pulling the image off of our computer, there are distinctive white or amber lights going around the top then a blue light around the bottom.    We never saw it with the naked eye..   We also captured what appears to be a satalite then another object that we are not sure of at all.   The digital camara picked up many many stars.  It is amazing. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness, and we are awaiting copies of the photographs.  PD));36.7472361702127;-108.177323404255
