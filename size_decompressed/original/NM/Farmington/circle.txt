Daytime ufos that appeared above Farmington New Mexico in 1978.;1978-04-01 04:00:00;7-10 min.;Daytime ufos that appeared above Farmington New Mexico in 1978. We were all sitting on our back porch relaxing when my sister noticed three circular objects above the foothills behind our house. The foothills were about three miles from our back porch. My sister told us all to look at these crazy things above the hills. As we all watched them, it appeared as if they were performing some kind of odd ballet in the sky. They kept darting back and forth horizontal to the horizon at great speeds, but we were wondering how the kept from hitting each other as they seemed to dart in and out of each other. the opjects seemed to look like the moon when you can see it in the daytime. (wierd description I know but they seemed illuminated like that.) they darted along for several minuets after we spotted them, and at one point they all started moving to our right along the horizon and gained speed and then moved rapidly up at about a 45 degree angle and dissapeared in less then a second. We did not think of it at the time but the radio we were listening to became heavy with static. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in April 1978 is approximate.  PD));36.7472361702127;-108.177323404255
Four objects in  circular reddish moving in the sky over Farmington and Kirtland, NM.;2007-09-13 19:30:00;15 minutes;Four objects in  circular reddish moving in the sky over Farmington and Kirtland, NM. She stated that between 7:30 at dusk a family friend of my sister stated that she reported seeing a reddish round circular object with four other objects moving in the air. Then she said that something was coming out of the bottom and it was large. She stated that she never saw anything like it before. She stated that between 7:30 at dusk between Farmington, and Kirtland, New Mexico. She said over seven people were looking up into the sky watching these strange objects. She stated that suddenly the military appreared, which is strange since this community has no military bases or operations in the area other than one small guard unit. Trucks and jets began swarming the area. She stated she had never in her life seen anything like this in the air. My sister's friend said that her son took pictures and video/DVD of the incident.;36.7472361702127;-108.177323404255
Single reddish circle  in the sky that wasn't jet nor satelitte;2011-10-10 01:00:00;5 minutes;Single reddish circle  in the sky that wasn't jet nor satelitte It's been nearly 2 years since I saw it, but after hearing your show on coast to coast I thought I would share my story.  What surprised me was the mention of circle shaped objects that looked red or even like fire balls. I had no idea it was a common description of UFOs.  What I saw that night was a circle shape that was reddish orange with a dull glow in the sky towards the east.  It almost looked like a large planet glowing low and far in the sky, but then I noticed it was moving slowly.  It could not have been an airliner because they have more than one light and usually have one blinking, and it clearly looked like a single large circle of light.  I wondered if it might be a satellite, but it was too large to qualify as one.  I was stumped.  I've never witnessed anything quite like it.  I watched it for about five minutes as it slowly drifted away eastwards. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD));36.7472361702127;-108.177323404255
4 UFO's OVER FARMINGTON, NM.;2015-05-16 16:40:00;5-10 minutes;4 UFO's OVER FARMINGTON, NM. My friend and I were in my vehicle.  I looked up into the sky towards the west where the sun is setting, toward some dark and grey clouds.  I spotted 4 different things in the sky, they appeared to be black and circular.  These crafts were hovering or flying together in the sky at nearly an identical speed, in formation.  One craft was slightly further out than the others. The other 3 crafts formed a triangle in formation.  All 4 crafts moved in the same direction, going further west. Also, I will add, maybe 6 years ago, I've seen a previous craft take off at light speed, over my neighbors house here in Farmington, NM I had no idea you could report UFO sightings online, otherwise I would have done it the instant it happened.  The craft emitted a blue, purple, white, very very bright and brilliant colored hue when it left.  The only way I knew it was there, is because I could feel the energy coming from the craft or whatever was inside. I am a believer of extra-terrestrial intelligence.;36.7472361702127;-108.177323404255
