Blue Neon Craft;2005-07-07 00:00:00;2 minuties;Blue Neon Craft Well, around about after midnight my cousin and I were sleeping on the trampoline.  We observed a very unusual event that will transformed our lives forever.  Out of nowhere a neon blue circular craft came in our view.  We immediately wanted to tell our parents, but we were so afraid to move.  So we just observed the object to see what will happen.  The light began to slowly fade away.  As it was fading away it took off across the sky like a falling star..  And it disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));36.6534;-108.7323
