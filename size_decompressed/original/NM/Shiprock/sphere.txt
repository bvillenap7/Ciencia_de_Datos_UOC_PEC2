White orb with miniature lights captured in photo. NM, USA.;2017-03-27 19:00:00;1 minute;White Orb with Miniture Lights Captured in Photo. NM, USA. On the evening of 3/27, at exactly 7:00pm I took a number of pictures of the clouds, during the sunset, facing west, as a light rain was coming in, and when I went to look at the pictures, I took, I noticed that this round light was in the center of my picture, and it ruined a good shot.  I zoomed into the picture and noticed a weird orb-looking light with mini lights on it.  Later that evening, I should my older brother and he noticed the same orb in the next picture, behind some clouds. I didnâ€™t know what I had taken a picture of.
