Blinking red light not a route of any aircraft of any sort.;2004-04-12 22:10:00;10 minutes;Blinking red light not a route of any aircraft of any sort. The light started out from the south. The light was red and blinking everytime it blinked it moved quite a distant. The light made a big circle from the south toward the west. The other light I had seen was just a few moments it started from the north then move toward the west. The route wasn't no aircraft it moved in a big circle from the south to the west. The light was just a blinking red light there were no other colors than red. Has anyone seen this sort of activity?;36.6534;-108.7323
