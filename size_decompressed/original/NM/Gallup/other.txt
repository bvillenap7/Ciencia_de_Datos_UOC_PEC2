huge bright white  horeshoe lit object;2008-04-18 21:25:00;2 minutes;huge bright white  horeshoe lit object This craft was seen above Rte 66 about a thousand feet up. But distances are hard to figure in the sky. However, it was horseshoe shaped as best as I could tell or at least it had lights going around it that were in a horseshoe configuration. The lights looked almost crystal white. My daughter who is 18 saw the same thing. It looked to me that the object was not moving or barely moving. My daughter thought it was moving a bit but since we were driving it is hard to tell if it was moving. The object appeared to be as big as several houses put together. Or if you looked at a full moon in the sky it may have been as big as 50 full moons. I didn't hear any noise but I think I had the radio on. I got out of the car to get a better look in a minute after seeing it because I couldn't see it any more. When I looked all around there was no object at all. It literally seemed to have disappeared.;35.5032363636364;-108.743522727273
