Strange star-like object emits lights from sky.;2002-03-15 20:30:00;5 minutes;Strange star-like object emits lights from sky. On the evening of March 15, 2002 as the moon sat in the western sky, my husband and I noticed what looked like a star just beneath the moon.  Maybe a little to the right.  At first we assumed it was a star but not until it started to appear brighter and brighter.  Then it casted a beam (like a huge spotlight) at first straight ahead then it slowly beamed downward.  As the light slowly disappeared what seemed to be clouds started taking shape.  The light was completely gone and the clouds started to fade very slowly. My husband and I had pulled over hoping someone had witnessed what we just saw unfortunately we were the only ones on the road.  We were hoping someone other than in our vicinity had witnessed this event.  We had never seen anything like it before. I mean it couldn't have been an aircraft of any kind much less a missil.  What kind of aircraft or missile would make a very bright light?  Although it scared us, it was in a way made a beaufiyl scenery. I knew that if this was reported there would be some kind of excuse or cover up for it.  Not until a few years later I became aware of this website and to my surprise there were similar sightings reported. So I decided to report the incident. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

SW view. Very sharp, fast flashing red light. Very similar to what I thought was an airplane.  Light was traveling SW at a slow pace. S;2003-04-20 02:00:00;3:00 minutes;SW view. Very sharp, fast flashing red light. Very similar to what I thought was an airplane.  Light was traveling SW at a slow pace. Suddenly the light stopped it's motion and became still with no movement. The sharp, red flashing continued.  Suddenly, the red light began to zig zag up and down. It did this for 4 or 5 turns then stopped (continuing to flash sharply). Then it appeared to light up, then it shot out at an extremely fast pace (SW direction). This was like it went into light speed. The red light went from still, no motion to blast off. It looked very similar to a comet with a light tail.  I watched it for what seemed like 2-3 minutes. The evening was very calm and clear. No clouds and about 3/4 full moon.;35.5032363636364;-108.743522727273
Extremely bright white light with yellow and green strobing, long duration ((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Sirius??  PD));2004-03-10 21:50:00;30+ minutes;Extremely bright white light with yellow and green strobing, long duration My husband stepped outside onto our porch and made a yelp of surprise, calling for me.  I stepped outside as well and he pointed out an object in the sky.  It was extremely bright, low on the western horizon and large.  It appeared to be hovering not too far from us.  At first we thought it was possibly a helicopter because we could hear the sound of one approaching but we realized it was not coming from the light but an actual helicopter heading towards the light itself.  This helicopter departed the scene after a red light seemed to dart out from the light itself.  At least 6 military jets were circling the light at a much higher altitude, keeping a good distance between it and them.  The light hovered still for about 10 minutes and then moved very quickly to the right before continuing to hover.  My 8 year old son came out to see what we were staring at and shouted It's a spaceship!.  I told him that I didn't know what it was but it was definitely odd.  Two other neighbors were outside and appeared to be watching it as well.  We were still debating whether or not it was a search helicopter because it certainly did not seem like one.  There was a strobing effect to the light in an alternating yellow/green pattern.  We realized that it was moving once again, this time away from us, due west.  Although it was diminishing in size, the brightness of the object stayed constant and at the same altitude.  At that point, we realized that what we were looking at was not the headlight of a helicopter at all. We watched it until we could see it no more because houses obstructed the view.  When it departed, the military entourage departed as well and it was a normal quiet Gallup, NM evening once again.  The last sight that we had of it, it seemed to blink red once.  The rest of the time, it was just an extremely bright white light in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We wonder whether the witnesses might have been looking at the dramatically twinkling star, that would have been visible in the southwest sky on the time and date indicated by the witness.
