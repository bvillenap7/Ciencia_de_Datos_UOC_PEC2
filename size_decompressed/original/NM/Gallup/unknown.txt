Strange controlled beam of light emitting out of the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 19:00:00;30 seconds;Strange controlled beam of light emitting out of the sky. A bright light was projected out of the air/clouds, like a controlled beam of light, and it didn't move or make any sounds.  After several seconds, the light/beam slowly retracted and almost disappeared.  Only a shade/fog/mist/cloud was dimly lit, almost gray in color.   A second after it went out, there was a small thin trail or whisp of light that went away from it.  It was so bright, it looked like a street light in the sky.  The way it faded out, seemed very concise and controlled. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));35.5032363636364;-108.743522727273
