Bright light in the stars with a jagged tail;2018-07-17 23:27:00;<1 second;Bright light in the stars with a jagged tail We were taking night photos of the stars with a 50mm lens on a Canon EOS Rebel T2i by laying the camera lens up and setting it to take long exposure shots.  In one photo we caught a small unknown image.  The stars all show up as single dots, but there is one very bright light with a tail that is in a curved, non-uniform line.  We did not view with our eyes, we discovered the image after we looked at the photo the next morning.;33.2111;-107.2212
