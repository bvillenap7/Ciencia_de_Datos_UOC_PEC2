Bright White Golden Sphere, craft hovering the ground, shooting straight up and then horizontally on Hwy 42 in New Mexico;2015-10-15 05:23:00;05:53;Bright White Golden Sphere, craft hovering the ground, shooting straight up and then horizontally on Hwy 42 in New Mexico Driving from Highway 42  from Corona, NM, to Willard, NM.  There is a Dairy that sits to the left hand side.  At 05:23 on October 15, 2015, I noticed a very large, round bright light blinking in the agricultural field at the dairy.  It was very bright and blinking/flashing on and off. White and Golden were the colors of this round, bright, craft.   As I approached closer it lifted atraight up off the ground.  I remember watching it lift straight up and moving horizontally through my rearview and side mirrors on my vehicle. The craft lifted straight up from the ground and I estimated only 1000 feet above the ground.  It was still very dark out so it could have been higher.  The large round light craft began moving horizontally across moving towards Corona and the Geomerer Ranch where the windmills sit upon the mesa.  As I watched in my rear view mirror and side mirrors, the red lights on the windmills went out as the craft passed.  The craft was on the floor of the valley as the windmills are on the top of the mesa. I had a lost amount of time while watching this craft.  What normally takes me 3 minutes to the train tracks from this spot, took 14 minutes.  One minute I witnessed the light and the time, the next I was at the train tracks  and the time was 05:47.  Once I hit the train tracks, I could still see the craft hovering along the ground line towards Corona, then it lifted up and went up into the skyline where I lost sight of it. I noticed right away, that I did not feel well after the sighting.  I arrived at work and all day my stomach was upset, I had weird numbing sensations in my body.;34.5754;-106.0307
