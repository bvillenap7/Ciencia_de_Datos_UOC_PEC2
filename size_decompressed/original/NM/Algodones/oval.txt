Now early this morning we were fishing saw a falling star were all looking up and then comes flying directly over us is this oval shaped object, very very dark and black looking on top, glowing blue from the bottom, and what we all congruently believe were 2 thrusters circular shaped objects accelorating the object like a plane, but no sound at all, it was very close above us and seemed that it was crashing---we all ran up to the top of the river bank to see the crash--and never a noise or crash nor flames- it really stunned and wowed us, we genuinly saw an opject crashing, flying directly overhead, very clear night bright moon and however it happened it didnt make a sound when it crashed behind the treeline somewhere.  we walked closer but then found many fences that it was within indian reservation boundaries and we are all familiar with the local natives in the area that their tribal enforcement isn't something to push around.  We left tried driving muptiple areas to view where we assume the object would have fallen but with no change in scenery, nor distrubances, its very uniquie.;35.389;-106.3517
