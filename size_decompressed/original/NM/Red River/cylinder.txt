We had heard there were sightings in the area by the locals, so we watched the skies each night of our stay. Nothing at all unusual for the first 3 days. On our last day, I awoke at 4:30 a.m. and looked out the window to the south. It was a very clear night. I saw an extremely bright light in the sky that stood out over all the stars. I looked at it through the binoculars and discovered that it was actually 2 separate lights, side by side. I awoke my son and brother to verify what I saw.  They agreed it was 2 separate lights and absolutely NOT a star or a planet(s). The lights were dazzingly white and stationary. We watched them until the sun rose and finally couln't see them anymore because of the sun, although they were visible in the early morning daylight hour after all the other stars had faded.;36.6827;-105.4628
