Brilliant Blue Orb over Red River, New Mexico - Stunning Movements.;2012-12-30 20:15:00;20 seconds;Brilliant Blue Orb over Red River, New Mexico - Stunning Movements On our drive back from dinner my Dad pointed out a brilliant bright blue orb hovering in the night sky.  We all saw it.  The craft was motionless against a completely clear night sky.  The object didn't appear to be very high in the sky since we could observe it through the front windshield of our SUV.  The craft/object then made an impossibly sharp turn and split into four horizontal blue orbs.  The intensity of the brilliant blue light never changed and the four objects reformed into one sphere, hovered for a few seconds and then shot straight down behind the mountains.  The orb had no visible contrail or exhaust just a solid brilliant blue orb.  We were traveling west on Main Street in Red River.  The object was slightly to the right of the nose of our SUV.  Sawmill Mountain is in the general direction that the craft was observed.  I cannot hazard a guess to the size or distance of the blue orb.  There was no sound.  I have never witnessed anything like ! this before and it unnerved us all.  Hoping others witnessed this as well.;36.6827;-105.4628
