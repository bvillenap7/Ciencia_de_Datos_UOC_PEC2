Lights over New Mexico.;2010-05-26 22:00:00;10-15 minutes;Lights over New Mexico. On the night of May 26 in the year 2019 at about 10:00pm Mountain Standard Time a small light was seen zig zagging and pulsating across the sky.  It traveled from southeast to northwest through a clear night.  It was high in altitude.  The night was clear and cool.  After initially observing the zig zagging light the sighting was then confirmed by three other witnesses ranging from the age of 10 to 65.  The light then disappeared after 3 minutes.  Only to reappear about a minute later with four additional lights traveling from south to north across the sky.  These lights were traveling in a line and close together.  As the five lights traveled traveled in linear synchronization.  Every move was made in unison.  The lights were traveling at high velocity and high altitude. These five lights were also confirmed by a fifth witness.  Several airplanes were observed throughout the night and the zig zagging lights were not remotely related to the airplanes.  As the five lights swept across the night the last light then made a 180 and darted in the opposite direction.  This took about 5-7 minutes.;35.5714;-105.6677
