Pulsing white light over the horizon and a small moving light in the opposite direction.;2013-08-26 17:30:00;5 seconds;Pulsing white light over the horizon and a small moving light in the opposite direction. A friend and I were on Highway 39 about 2 or 3 hours away from Tucumcari heading south southeast.  I told him since we were in the middle of nowhere and it was so dark there was a good chance we might see a ufo so keep an eye out.   I had been staring at different stars for almost an hour when for whatever reason I fixated on what I believed was Venus because it was the brightest thing in the sky since dusk.  After I had been staring at it for about 5-10 minutes I saw a smaller light that seemed to come out of it or at least out from in front of it.  I blinked and squinted to make sure it wasn't just my eyes playing tricks on me and it was still there.  I blinked a few more times and before I could tell my friend to look it had completely disappeared.   Around that time my friend that was driving kept telling me he was seeing a pulsing white light over the horizon in the opposite direction.  I looked a few times when I he said he saw it but I missed it every t! ime.  The way he described it was that there was an extremely bright light on the other side of a hill or the horizon and the light would come on it lit up the entire horizon in that direction brighter than anything he had seen.  Unfortunately after I saw my light he stopped seeing his.;35.1658;-103.7173
