Watched this object before it got dark, it was a dirty white color.  It stayed stationary in the sky. When the sun began to set, it lit up in a bright white light.  After a good 45 minutes, all the time stationary, it changed colors from white, to a mixture of white and red, with like a red aura around it. Not long after that, it began moving rapidly up at an angle, until it looked like a star in the sky, then disappeared. No flashing beacon.  The object was big! Got poor pictures from a cell phone camera, but there was a man taking pictures with a 35mm camera with a big zoom lens.  Many people witnessed this object.;35.1658;-103.7173
