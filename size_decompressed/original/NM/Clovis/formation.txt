Since we had just moved into this house, I wasn’t familiar with the neighborhood vista yet, and thought it was a radio tower of some kind, that’s how still they were.    Then, all of a sudden, the two middle lights moved horizontally to make a diamond formation this pattern was held for a few seconds and then the bottom light moved up between the two horizontal lights, forming a chevron, then in a split second they moved higher into the sky and were gone into the darkness of the night.   From the time I noticed the lights, until they were gone, less than a minute had elapsed. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the event is approximate.
