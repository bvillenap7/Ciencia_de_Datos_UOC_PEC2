There was a period of approximately one week in which lights appeared over the base for several evenings.  At one point the base was on alert and the flight line was shut down.  You have a report from another person in your files who has reported this sighting.  The lights were photographed from high buildings in Clovis and appeared on the front page of the Clovis news paper.  Being assigned to the flight line in support of F-111s several of my people reported near encounters with the lights (ufos and were visably shaken by the experience.  There was also the experience at Holloman AFB in 1967 when aircraft were launched to intercept lights over Alamogordo, NM.  The official report was that the lights were aircraft dropping flares.  This is a bunch of crap as Lincoln National Forest was on high fire danger at the time.  Having talked with at least one pilot who confirmed that they tried to chase the (UFOS) but never got close, I know that a lot of people in the USAF have had their experiences.  Some will talk and some won't.  These are but 2 of the numerous sightings I have witnessed. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));34.4121922330096;-103.218615533981
I acrobatic, 3 in formation, bright light coming from ground near ranches;2005-09-11 22:30:00;2.5 hours;I acrobatic, 3 in formation, bright light coming from ground near ranches The UFO was a bright light in the western sky, at first I mistook if for an aircraft, until it changed direction and started doing maneuvers that standard aircraft can't accomplish.  It was obviously not a star, as it had the same type of reflection that satellites, the ISS, aircraft, etc have from the moon and sun.  It changed directions randomly and suddenly, and sometimes sat still. To the north of the UFO doing accrobatics was a triangular formation of 3 other lights, that I first thought was the tail of the little dipper, but realized it wasn't the dipper since the dipper portion was missing.  Looked like the formation might be moving very slowly but couldn't tell.  Kept my attention mostly on the acrobatic, looking at the formation every 10 minutes or so. After an hour, went inside to take a shower (aprox 15 minutes), came back out and the formation had moved higher in the sky and closed into a perfect triangle.  The moving light was still present and in the same area, and started to see random flashing lights coming from the ground, what seemed to be maybe 20 miles northwest of town, out near ranches and farms.  Continued to watch for about another hour. About midnight finally went to bed as the UFO kept repeating itself and I had to go to work early.;34.4121922330096;-103.218615533981
Performing maneuvers near Clovis, NM, same craft as 9/11;2005-09-12 21:00:00;1.5 hours;Performing maneuvers near Clovis, NM, same craft as 9/11 UFO was seen in approximatly same area of the sky as last night.  Tonight I drove out to the country to get a better look at it.  I am almost certain this is not an alien craft, but rather a military craft doing test maneuvers. For the first hour it moved around in the sky on maneuvers described last night.  It appeared that 1 or possibly 2 small aircraft were staying in close proximity to the UFO, maybe observing it, but after about 15 minutes they left. Within the first hour I positivly identified an aircraft, possibly civilian or perhaps a small military craft approach the UFO.  Upon getting in close proximity the aircraft did a 180 turnaround and proceeded in the opposite direction it had came from.  About 20 minutes later another unidentifiable craft came down from the southern part of the sky.  Craft was a bright light heading towards the UFO at a high rate of speed and downward angle, after reaching approximatly the same elevation, second craft's light went out and it disappeared. Not sure what happened.  After an hour and a half, the UFO took off across the sky in an easterly direction at a fairly high rate of speed, stopped in mid air, and traced it's path back to where it had come from.  Will be checking again on 9/13 to see if it is again performing maneuvers.;34.4121922330096;-103.218615533981
UFO seen, possible govt test;2005-09-13 21:00:00;2 hours;UFO seen, possible govt test Saw craft in the western sky for the third night in a row.  Craft was in approximatly the same area as before, but started off at a much higher altitude than previous night.  Watched it again perform maneuvers for about 2 hours until it finally dropped below the horizon, perhaps landing but I can't be sure.  There was alot of air traffic in the area this night, but only one aircraft had an encounter with it.  An aircraft was coming from the west, traveling east.  It was at a higher altitude than the UFO, and dropped altitude to meet with the UFO.  Upon getting close to the UFO, the aircraft immediatly changed flight paths and quickly climbed in altitude, then continued on it's original flight path and continued traveling east.  So far the night of 9/12/05 has been the most active night.  I am about 95% sure that what I am seeing is a govt test as they are returning to the same area each night at about the same times to fly.;34.4121922330096;-103.218615533981
Looked like a bright star moving quite fast;2007-08-03 08:50:00;5 minutes;Looked like a bright star moving quite fast high in the sky.  Bright light. Moving very fast across the sky, kept on going for at least 5 minutes till we couldn't see it anymore. Steady light, not a blinking light.   We saw a few military aircrafts flying in the sky after the object dissappeared. No real indicators of a normal aircraft like blinking lights, or red blinking lights, trails.;34.4121922330096;-103.218615533981
Rectangle shape light near Air Force Base.;2021-05-26 22:00:00;00:15;Rectangle shape light near Air Force Base. Briefly saw a rectangle shaped light at a 26-degree angle hovering in the sky. The lights were very bright as if one or many engines facing away from us. It had to be exceptionally large. As someone familiar with aircraft it was likely 300’ wide if not larger and like nothing I’ve ever seen. The object slowly disappeared through the clouds.;34.4121922330096;-103.218615533981
