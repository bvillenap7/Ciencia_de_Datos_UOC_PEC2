it blocked out the stars as it slowly tracked across town towards Cannon AFB, so I could make out its giant triangular shape easily;1983-09-15 21:00:00;5 minutes;I was a young man about 9(1984), but I have told this story to anyone who would listen my whole life as proof UFO's are not a myth. I was outside playing by myself on a moonless night and I cant say that I heard it, but I felt it for lack of a better term. It seemed audible but not really. I should have been able to hear it because it was not more than a thousand feet. I could not see the craft directly, but it blocked out the stars as it slowly tracked across town towards Cannon AFB, so I could make out its giant triangular shape easily, although I couldn't see the craft directly. I grew up near the AFB and was fascinated with it. I can remember not getting an extra-terrestrial feeling from the craft, but I always assumed it was carrying something to Cannon. The reason I am reporting this is because I went to meet a good friend of mine in Houston, TX just last week and over dinner he described seeing the exact same thing over Houston. He was doing relief work (we are wildland firefighters) and camping at the KOA. He saw a triangle object tracking across the sky. He said it blended in with the sky, but the moonlight was interfearing with its cloak. Anyway, I know these things were around as early as 1984. I felt it needed to be documented, the seem to be hard to see. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Source indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date above.

When at work myself and 5 other employees saw a very bright white light in the sky that looked like a very big star almost to big to be;2014-09-25 18:30:00;30 minutes;When at work myself and 5 other employees saw a very bright white light in the sky that looked like a very big star almost to big to be a star that's why it caught our attention we had binoculars with us and under further observation saw that there were three lights in the shape of a upside down triangle.  It lasted for 30 minutes in the same spot and didn't move then started to turn orange in color.  We went inside for 10 minutes and came out and it was gone. We did get a picture.  First time we've ever seen a light like that and were confused. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.4121922330096;-103.218615533981
Upside down triangle three light changing color object.;2014-09-25 18:30:00;40 minutes;Upside down triangle three light changing color object The person with me noticed a bright object in the sky during the hours of still a lot of sunlight.  The object was way to bright to be a star and we became curious of what it could be.  Driving to a better sight we met up with 2 others and got out binoculars. Looking closer at the object it was stand still in the air, with 3 bright lights in an upside down triangle fashion.  We stood there looking for about 20 minutes until driving to a gas station.  When we arrived it had moved from a north postition to a northwest position, still standstill.  We noticed around sunset the three white lights turned orange almost instantly.  After about 30 to 40 minutes of seeing it we looked up again and it was gone in an instant.  No stars in the night sky came even close to how bright this object was during daylight hours;34.4121922330096;-103.218615533981
