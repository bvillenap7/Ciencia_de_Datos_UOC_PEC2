But I don't think it was in June because I was in junior high and we were still in school, which in New Mexico back then got out in May.  I think it was September or October 1975.  I remember the kids whose parents were stationed at Cannon Air Force Base came to school one day and they were saying that that night their dads went on scramble alert and they were chasing something around that was too fast for them to catch. Of course that night my buddy came over to spend the night We spent a few hours checking out stars and looking for anything wierd. I remember we had found about three different lights that seemed to pulsate red,white, & blue but our science teacher had warned us in all the excitement that the atmosphere can make starlight pulsate.  The lights were far enough away to be indistinguishable from stars.  We tried to convince ourselves we were seeing UFOs but they weren't moving. So we were about to call it quits.  But while we were looking at the brightest of the pulsing lights, it glowed even brighter for a second, then streaked to its left, then up and to the right, completely out of sight.  I still to this day remember my amazement that we had actually seen something.  We stammered back and forth at each other then ran inside my house and dragged my dad outside.  He didn't see anything and smiled and went back inside.  It moved so fast, it was incredible.  I still get chills when I think about how it streaked out of sight right before my eyes.  We watched the other candidates for a while and kept searching the sky but we never saw anything else. Although I knew several people who were checking out the skies that second night nobody else saw anything. That's my story.  Not much but it really did happen.  I was so relieved to find out that someone else had already documented the incident and revealed some interesting facts.;34.4121922330096;-103.218615533981
