bright disk shaped object going down;2007-05-13 23:00:00;4 minutes;I was outside my home watching the clear night skies when i noticed a bright disk shaped object going down quite fast and i couldn't believe my eyes at what i was lookin. it was pretty closed it looked big and very bright i couldn't really notice any details on the object though. i'm pretty sure that what i saw was a ufo. i will keep my eyes open for more sightings as this isn't the first time i have seen stuff in the sky in this town. but this one is the closest thing i've ever seen.;34.4121922330096;-103.218615533981
