two women witness a triangular shaped craft;1999-06-10 23:50:00;5 seconds;two women witness a triangular shaped craft my aunt and i were driving north about two hours outside of Albuquerque, New Mexico. it was a moonless night. we were 21 miles south of the town of Cuba when we saw a craft moving vertically in front of us. as we passed under it, i turned and looked through the back passenger window and clearly saw the underbelly of a dark triangular shaped craft. it's trajectory would strongly suggest that it was about to crash. we pulled over immediately. when we got out it was completely gone. no lights on the horizon and the area was absolutely silent. the craft had lights on the tips and was an evenly sided triangle. it was dark and  fairly small, approximately 20 ft from centerpoint to triangle tip? i've never seen anything like this before in my life.;36.0482;-107.1885
Moving around 20 MPH and did not make a sound as it passed right in front of me;2004-11-17 21:00:00;5 minutes;Moving around 20 MPH and did not make a sound as it passed right in front of me I was heading north on state highway 44 between San Isidro NM and Cuba NM close to 9:30 PM , when I saw a very low flying object heading west from the Jemez Mountains, at first I thought it was a hellicopter, but as it came closer to me it was a triangled shaped object with lights, it was moving around 20MPH and close to around 150 feet off the ground, it was the size of a small air plane. It was so close to me that I could throw a golf ball at it and hit it. When I rolled down my window to watch it as it passed right in front of me, it did not make a sound of noise, it kept heading west over a small hill until i could not see it any more.;36.0482;-107.1885
