Possible fighter jet shooting at UFO;2011-06-25 23:05:00;2.5min;Possible fighter jet shooting at UFO I live out in the country, it is crystal clear outside,  the event I'm describing transpired a few minutes ago...  Was outside looking at the stars to the south when an object (possibly a fighter jet) was moving north at a very high altitude at high rate of speed (for a jet aircraft) and started to turn toward the east when it was directly above me.  It was at this moment when what i initially thought was a star flashed a brilliant white light at the (jet?).  Had the (jet?) not banked east, this (star?) would have been just about directly in its flight path, and as soon as the light was flashed, the (jet?) banked back around to the west side of the (star?) and as it was going by it what looked to me like a weapon of some sort was fired from the (jet?) at the (star?) with no effect, then the (jet?) just continued north. The (star?) it still just sitting out thereâ€¦;34.3963;-103.0619
