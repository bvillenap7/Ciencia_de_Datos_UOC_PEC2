Orange lights hovering and making formations by old Taos convent that burnt down.;2014-01-01 00:00:00;4 minutes;Orange lights hovering and making formations by old Taos convent that burnt down. Last night right a midnight we were going outside to pop some fireworks we saved from the 4th.  As we proceeded to go outside my friend told me there were lights in the sky and to hurry and come out to see.  What we saw was like nothing I have ever seen before.   I put it down on facebook last night and everyone is starting to chime in and we were not the only ones.....   What we saw was three orange lights in the sky hovering and making formations.  There were some clouds out last night so they went above the canopy and out of the north they came back to the same position.  I family member of mine said he saw them as early as 10:30 at night.;36.3923;-105.5822
