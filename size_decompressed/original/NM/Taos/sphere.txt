Large pulsating globe in eastern sky over Talpa NM;2015-11-24 18:11:00;5-7 minutes;Large pulsating globe in eastern sky over Talpa NM Toward the east ridge of Talpa mountains, I could see a large round pulsating light sitting still and approximately 6 other small blinking lights moving in different directions around the larger light.  Quickly large globe shot up towards the moon and the other little lights moved away and dissipated.  The large globe was video taped and when reviewing with zoom it looks like a ball of energy pulsating..   I have seen these before and have recorded them last year in the same direction i saw this current one.;36.3923;-105.5822
