I noticed it because it looked star like but seemed flattened on the edges/sides.  The light was not uniform.  It hovered and moved left and then right several times over the three minute period.  And, the lights on the bottom seemed to radiate out.  Not a spotlight but definitely lights.  Then it  slowly faded out.  Three minutes and a few seconds of viewing.;36.3923;-105.5822
