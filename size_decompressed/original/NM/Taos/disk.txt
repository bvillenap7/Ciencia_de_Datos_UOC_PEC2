Th;2002-10-06 15:00:00;1 hour or more;About 3:30 p.m. in Taos, New Mexico, my mother called me into the living room to look through the window. There was a Bright star. Then we saw it slowly but surely moving to the north. It was in the east. We looked through binoculars and saw red, green, white, yellow and blue lights. it was an oblong or disk shape. It was moving pretty fast. We tried to take pictures. My camera made some weird sounds and shut down after 4 shots. My mother, me, and my stepfather observed it for mare than an hour. We found it was too late and went to bed. But right before we left, we saw it bouncing around through the binoculars. I also thought i saw something bright shoot from the ufo. There was a slight haze around the object and it left a tiny trail. At time the object owuld also change light colors. We also saw an airplane race toward it. But then the airplane shifted lower, below the object.;36.3923;-105.5822

A photographer took three photos of a tree, and an anomalous, disc-shaped object shows up in photos.  ((NUFORC Note:  Cicada??  PD));2018-08-19 15:00:00;1/4 second;On the afternoon of August 19th at 3:00 PM, my partner and I were traveling south on Hwy 25 out of Taos.  I stopped to take a picture of a tree that overlooked to the west a vast plain and the Rio Grand Gorge.  I shot a bracketed 3 frame picture that represented an underexposed, properly exposed and overexposed set in less than ½ of a second.   The resulting picture shows a saucer shaped object moving upward in the left half of the photograph over the 3 frames of the ¼ second sequence.  The first frame shows the object near the base of the primary limb, the second shows how far the saucer moved in less than a ¼ second, the object was not in evidence in the the 3rd frame.  In my estimation it moved from its initial position to beyond the 3 frames in less than a ¼ second.   I took the picture with a 30 MP camera in a raw format, which was sensitive enough to catch what appears to be a fast moving saucer shaped object.  I would like to work with someone to evaluate the angle of the craft and backstep the trajectory to its take off spot somewhere along the Taos Gorge, which may be a nest location for others. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the photographer, and he sounded to us to be quite sincere and sober-minded.  We believe…but cannot be certain…that the tiny, disc-shaped object may be either a humming bird, or more likely, a cicada in flight.  There is a faint hint of wings above and below the object.
