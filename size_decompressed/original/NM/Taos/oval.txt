I thought I was looking at a usual star that I see every night(Venus),East sky 70degrees..Then I look over to the left and saw Venus rising,,  Then I looked quickly back to this,what I thought was Venus,and noticed it was starting to Dimm slowly until the light was gone.  The moon light however,illuminated an oval shaped object that appeared to dip down and dive out of sight.  If I could describe it to anything, it would be the Millineum Falcon.  At first I thought,maybe it was a head-on beam,but it just dimmed to nothingness.  Feel free Peter if you want to contact me for any more peticular specifics.;36.3923;-105.5822
