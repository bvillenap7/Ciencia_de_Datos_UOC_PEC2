Two bright objects traveling from south to the north disappeared;2007-10-04 05:20:00;3 minutes;Two bright objects traveling from south to the north disappeared What Two bright objects traveling from south to the north. Where: I was facing east  Location: 36º28’05.11 N 105º 39’56.35 W When: Oct. 4th 2007  Time: 5:20 am   I was facing east and the morning air was crisp. The time was 5:20am on Oct. 4th 2007. I saw one illuminated object flying across sky from the south to north. I watched it for a few moments. It flew at a distance of about 6 miles from my point of view and above the mountain at a high altitude. The object traveled in a linear direction at a rate as fast or faster than a jet. It was brighter than a plane and did not have colored lights. I watched it for a few moments more before I noticed a similar bright object that traveled on a path behind the first object. The milkway & constellations were bright and at a significant distance behind object and there was not a cloud in the sky. The first object disappeared after traveling about some miles from my point of view. I watched the second object until its light disappeared a few seconds later at the same location.

A light dropped vertically, hesitated, then travelled horizontally at 5000 mph.;2011-02-14 18:45:00;4 seconds;A light dropped vertically, hesitated, then travelled horizontally at 5000 mph. I was driving South towards Taos, NM on 512 just South of Questa, NM.   Civil twilight had faded. I was going up a moderate hill and had an unobstructed view of the sky.  A light appeared dead ahead at an apparent altitude of 12,000 AGL and 15 miles distant.  The intensity of the light was about the same as an aircraft landing light at the same range. The light dropped vertically by several thousand feet then hesitated for 1 second.  The light then descended to the West at roughly 5,000 miles per hour at a 30-degree angle.  The light did not leave a trail of any kind. The light disappeared at an altitude of 4000 feet after a traveling horizontally across 45 degrees of my field of view.  When I crested the hill, it looked like the light had been over the Northern outskirts of Taos.  There were at least 2 aircraft in the far vicinity - one light plane at 5,000 AGL and one airliner at 20,000.;36.3923;-105.5822
White light over New Mexico;2011-06-30 23:09:00;35 minutes;White light over New Mexico Upon exiting my front door, I what appeared to be a bright star or aircraft, however the light slowly turned I noticed no blinking aircraft lighting.  The light then proceeded to a very high attitude.  I watched the light for several minutes.  It moved in all directions and occasionally would give a strange burst of light usually in a triangler shape.  This strange movement of up down circles continued for about 20 minutes in that same area.  I went inside to check on my infant daughter and upon returning outside the light had moved from the northeast sky to the northwestern part.  It wasn't hard to locate and appeared to continue with the same pattern of movements until about 23:43.  It then simply vanished.

Large ball of orange/yellow light in Taos, NM.;2014-12-31 22:00:00;Several minutes;Large ball of orange/yellow light in Taos, NM A friend and I were driving in the southwestern part of the city when she pointed out a light in the sky. I was the passenger and ducked my head and looked to the upper left area and noticed a large orange light that appeared to be traveling west at a relatively slow pace. The light changed colors slowly from orange to yellow to white.  It had the look of a ball of plasma or electricity, sort of undulating and almost pulsing but with very erratic edges rather than a defined circle. I asked her to pull over and as she did so I got out of the car intending to take cell phone video of the object.  There was a very thin cloud cover you could see the stars thru. I would estimate the clouds at around 5,000 feet.  As I walked up a rocky driveway to get a higher perspective and prepared my phone to capture some video, the object suddenly changed direction from west to east, rose above the thin cloud cover and shot out of sight.  The object was so bright it would have been easily seen through the thin, see-through clouds, but once it changed direction and elevated it was simply gone. Due to the elevation and how large it appeared from our perspective I believe this was a rather large object.  Far larger than any modern aircraft would appear at that distance.  My best guess is that it was several times larger than a hot air balloon and made no sound at all.;36.3923;-105.5822
The sky was dark.  I saw two beams of light appear, shooting from the horizon of the mountain.;2015-12-18 05:31:00;5 seconds;This morning I was having morning prayer.  The sky was dark.   I saw two beams of light appear, shooting from the horizon of the mountain, that moved across the sky right to left, one, then the next.   Then all of a sudden, center stage, behind the tallest point of the Sangre De Cristos, a big blast of light right behind the whole range, lit up the entire sky.  I didn't know what I was seeing?!;36.3923;-105.5822
Large light, equivalent to car lights 1 mile away, in sky, stationary.;2016-12-12 19:07:00;20 minutes;large light, equivalent to car lights 1 mile away, in sky, stationary. Saw a light, brighter than star, and appeared stationary.  Near or in cloud, surrounded by darkness.  Near full moon illuminated scene.   Decided to film it, so pulled over and steadied camera.  Filmed nearly ten minutes, yet it really never seemed to move, however the light did shift, and could be blamed on cloud movement.  At one point, I did see what I thought was a red light emanating from the object.   It's light, white, appeared 2-3 times the brightness of other stars.  At one point, it looked like it was leaving, but no turns or sudden movements, and I remained filming, and it remained in the same place.   I have seen these bright stars occasionally and wondered if they were not something else.   No sound.  Larger than other airplane traffic, no movement, ...so this is so simple, that it seems unlikely.  The object on my film actually appears to be an luminated object, with a dark hole in the middle.  Peace on Earth.;36.3923;-105.5822
UFO Near Andromeda constellation.;2017-10-01 20:15:00;5 minutes;UFO Near Andromeda constellation. 8:15pm MST Northeastern sky near Andromeda constellation--I thought I was looking at a plane flying across the sky, then I realized the extremely bright light to the left (north) was moving.  I noticed it was brilliant white, brighter than Venus in the night sky.   After viewing the UFO for the amount of time it takes to smoke a cigarette it “pulled away” the light vanished.  I looked again at the sky and the object  I thought was a moving plane was still there - either a planet or a star.  I had goosebumps over my entire body, when I realized what I had seen.  I’ve heard stories of UFO’s flying in and out of Taos Mountain. Maybe they were visiting the pueblo.;36.3923;-105.5822
3 “stars” in a straight line calmly moving in a linear path!  ((NUFORC Note:  Space Link satellites.  PD))((anonymous source));2019-05-26 21:40:00;3 minutes;3 “stars” in a straight line calmly moving in a linear path! While stargazing and identifying Orion’s Belt..  3 other “stars” caught my eye.  They were spaced out just as  Orion’s Belt, but moving in a very calm and steady linear path.  They were all seemingly connected and a part of something larger.  Connected my a translucent line, similar to fishing line.. a few times there were smaller faint “stars” that would appear to be trailing along behind it on the solitary path.  It almost felt as though these “stars” were a part of a much larger machine that was invisible to the naked eye.  I followed the train for about 3 minutes until it reached a point of light pollution and my eyes couldn’t keep up.  Never once did it bounce or steer off the course of a straight line.  Blended right in with the stars.. you wouldn’t double take unless you were doing what I was doing —- stargazing... and knowing that stars don’t move like THAT.  I looked up the satellites just as an option of debunking.. but nothing in the NM area tonight.  Alsoattempted to record but they were very dim and camera gone do poorly in low light.
