Fast moving star-like light.;2016-09-18 22:00:00;2-3 minutes;Fast moving star-like light. I was camping alone and was admiring the bright stars on this very clear night.  I was about 8-9K feet in elevation on the west side of the mountains.  I had a good wide view of the night sky.  As I looked towards the North, I noticed a light similar to a star moving at a NE direction, coming from the SW.  There were no strobes or blinking lights on or around it.  It was moving fast and began to slightly change direction towards the east.  Then I lost view of this light.   It was traveling faster than any high altitude plane or aircraft that I have ever seen.  I am not sure what it was.  No noise.  No other lights or craft were in the sky at the time.;35.785;-105.9178
