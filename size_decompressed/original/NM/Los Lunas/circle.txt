I turned down a dirt road and cut the lights off and slowly coasted down the road...  They had lost us but before leaving to make sure they were gone we hung outside the car for a little bit.  Next thing you know I see something off in the distance about twenty yards out eye level slowly drifting closer.  It was a bright orange ball and drifted about five feet away from us at the car...  The weird thing is I don't remember driving the car back to my friends house where when were then playing video games all this in the matter of an hour... makes me wonder if what we thought were headlights following us or a ufo that did find us;34.7814;-106.714
Large bright orange light in the northern sky twards Albuquerque.;2008-03-29 00:05:00;~4;Large bright orange light in the northern sky twards Albuquerque. At about 00:05 I went outside to grab something out of my truck. As I was near my truck I noticed a bright orange light in the northern sky towards Albuquerque. It was lower than most airplanes I see coming into Albuquerque International. It didn't look too high because it was barely higher than the trees and a radio tower. There was no noise that I could hear, also it didn't move. Also it looked larger than airplanes I've seen at night. After a few minutes of trying to figure out what it was I went inside to grab my binoculars. After I couldn't find them I just grabbed my camera and went back outside to get pictures, and it was gone. I spent another half an hour outside seeing it would come back but nothing.;34.7814;-106.714
Red/White flashing lights moving in sky.  Over 15 red flashing lights counted, and they were moving seemed to almost shoot.;2014-03-08 20:00:00;45 minutes;Red/White flashing lights moving in sky.  Over 15 red flashing lights counted and they were moving seemed to almost shoot. While outside witness lots of birds flying east at night and very fast. Thought it was strange then saw Red and White round lights hovering in the sky. 5 people on street and 3 others on the phone all saw the same thing.  Lights were in groups and moving both fast and slow then disappearing and reappearing in different location.   Lasted over 45 minutes.  If you looked close enough you can see little white lights almost being shot off the blinking light. Very different and wasn't expecting it.  We saw a few airplanes and these lights were nothing compared to a star or a aircraft.  But quite a few airplanes out over us which isn't to common.
