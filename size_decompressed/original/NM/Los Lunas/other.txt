Small white object flying low and fast.;2016-04-19 13:00:00;1 minute;Small white object flying low and fast. I was in my back yard looking north.  I noticed something white going from east to west at a high rate of speed.  It was white, small, and looked round.  It was only about 200 foot off the ground (too low for airplane) going in a very straight line (not a bird) and moving very quick (also not a bird). I did not hear any sound from the object, did not see flapping wings, and also no lights.;34.7814;-106.714
