Lights south of Los Lunas, New Mexico.;2017-01-23 19:00:00;90 minutes;Lights south of Los Lunas, New Mexico. In the south sky.  A bright light had appeared after a while another light came out  it started to fade after about half an hour  I had my mother on the phone because she had seen it before so I shined my flashlight towards it and it got brighter so I did it a few more times it's seem to let me know that he could see me and it totally disappeared and I'd shine my light back at it and it would get bright again this went on all the way up to 8 o'clock;34.7814;-106.714
32+ flying objects in chain formation  ((Starlink satellites??));2020-01-14 19:00:00;35 minutes;32+ flying objects in chain formation I saw a chain of lights coming from the southwestern sky, the lights were flying to the north east direction in chain line formation. Very high up.  I watched 32 or more fly by. No sound.  They all seemed to disappear in the same area near a particular star to the north. I saw one of the lights do a single u-turn loop before disappearing. The next light in line did several loops extremely fast, then disappeared. I continued to watch after it seemed to be over and I saw a few more lights fly in individually about 2 minutes apart. As soon as one disappeared, another would come from the southwest then disappear where the others disappeared. I called 3 news stations. 2 news stations had received reports just like my experience. 1 news station acted like I was prank calling them.;34.7814;-106.714
