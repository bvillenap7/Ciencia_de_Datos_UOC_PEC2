While driving back from Albuquerque on a crystal clear night I observed an object flying around Los Lunas hill.  Because of the moon light I could make out a dark object hovering and moving about.  As we got within about 5 miles the object lit up a part of the hill side with a light that did not look like any light I had ever seen.  The light was not instantaneous but moved toward the ground and then would go back up again.  It was also a differant color than one might imagine from a search light.  I woke up one of my sisters and pointed the object out.  We were within a mile of the hill now and the object(possibly round?) was moving around and occasionally shining the light downward.  As we got within a half a mile it rose approx. 500ft from the 100ft it was at and then accelerated at incredible speed SSW and disappeared.
