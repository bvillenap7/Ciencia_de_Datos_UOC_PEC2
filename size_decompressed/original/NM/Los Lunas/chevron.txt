I Was in my backyard playing with a laser pointer with my dog from my hottub and he was chasing it around.  Once in a while I would shine my laser up to the heavens and the moon wondering if anyone out there might be able to see it. I had turned it off and laid back in the water when I sensed something I was already looking up at the stars and a couple of planes that were in the area. They were kind of crisscrossing across the sky, anyway what I sensed or heard was a kind of  a whispering sound like the sound of a small fan or something like that kind of quiet but fright above me then I saw it, it was a craft and it went right over me from south to north it was v shaped kind of like the stealth with three dim lights under each side of the chevron it disappeared from my view right away and I know those planes couldn't see it. I think they were looking for the sourse of my laser pointer it was weird and I believe they are out there but I never saw anything like this. It was black or real dark grey and very stealth. I was by myself but I swear on my Parents grave I saw it. I'm kind of wondering if I shouldn't point my laser up the the sky at night anymore.;34.7814;-106.714
