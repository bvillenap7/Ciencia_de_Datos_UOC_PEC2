I went with her outdoors. After she finished I picked her up to go inside. As I walked up the back stepped I noticed a large oval object blinking red above the tree line, moving North to South. The red light was toward the front. At first, I thought it was an airplane.  The object was not moving, hovering, above the tree line. As I was watching a green light went on toward the center of the object and started blinking. Two lights were blinking at the same time, a red and green.  I was getting concerned because it was very large and I could not figure out how it stayed in the air and darted so fast and then did a complete stop.  It started to move very slowly, then darted fast toward my direction, now it was moving from West to East, and hovered.  Because I was standing near the back porch light. I thought this object seen me. I backed up in the dark shadows to try and figure it out.. The object seem to hover over the tree line. I got a very concerned, I went in the house Before I went in the object moved again from North to South. I did not hear any noise, it was quiet like it was gliding.  As far as size, it was above the tree line and with New Mexico’s clear skies the stars clearly showed the outline of the object.  Not knowing the exact distance, I thought it was in my neighbors back yard at first above his trees. But it had to be further, 150 to 200 yards, I’m not sure. It just seemed close.;32.9839;-105.9518
