Yellowish/orange sphere seen by 3 witness in Alamogordo, New Mexico.;2016-01-28 22:49:00;3 minutes;Yellowish/orange sphere seen by 3 witness in Alamogordo, New Mexico. We saw three of these in the sky 01/28/2016 at 10:49 P.M..   We (my wife and I) walked out the garage door and she noticed a yellow light at about the 12 o'clock position.  It was about the color of a amber street light.  Then at the 7 o'clock position another one came on.   A few seconds later at the center between these two, yet another one came on.   About one minute later the center one went out, then the lower one went out, followed by the one at the 12 o'clock position.   There were no aircraft sounds or any other sounds around.   We live in La Luz, NM, and the lights appeared to be over Alamogordo, NM, about 3 to 4 miles away.  These lights were very prominent in the night sky.   When I arrived at work (in Alamogprdo @ 2300), the security guard at the facility also told me he had seen these lights.;32.9839;-105.9518
