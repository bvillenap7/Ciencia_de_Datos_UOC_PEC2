bye bye footage;2002-01-07 08:25:00;30 mins;bye bye footage My mother and myself were coming back from a trip to the store when we exited our car and saw this strange spiral shape hovering in the distance. It flew in place for ABOUT 10 minutes that is when my mother and myself began to question if maybe we should call authorities we finally decided against our idea seeing that we both have honorable positions in society. At this time I decided to leave inside and grab our video camera i got about 15 minutes of good footage or so i thought. The craft just disappeared not only from our view but from our footage. ((NUFORC Note:  We will request that the student who submitted this report have her mother submit a report, as well.  No other reports received from Las Vegas, NM, for this time period.
