I was driving on I25 north of Las Vegas New Mexico at about 0230 am, I think I was about 60-70 miles out from Roton. There were no cars on the road and I was able to see quite a distance ahead and behind me. At one point a yellowish brite light  suddenly appeared in my rear view mirror and it was moving at a very high rate of speed and within 3-4 sec this light appeared to be within 500' behind me, then the light was gone. After going about another mile or so the light did the exact same thing and came up to me at a very high rate of speed, but this time it got closer and  when the light  went out I saw like little electrical currents where the light had been (kind of like what you see when you turn off a light and the filaments are still heated up and glowing). This time I immediately pulled over and got out to see what this was and I didn't see or hear anything. It was gone and I never saw it again. I had my cruise control set at 87mph and it came up to me like I was standing still.;35.5939;-105.2239
