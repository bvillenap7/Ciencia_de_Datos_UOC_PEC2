I was spending an evening looking at the moon with my telescope I was looking at the crater Langrenus, next to the Mare Fecunditatis. and i noticed a shadow traveling across the middle of it. Now if this had been a satalite it must have been VERY close to the moon because the shadow was moving along the land at a very quick pace. I could not have been somthing to far above .5 miles of the moons ground the shadow was not to large. I followed it Down (in reality it was up the telescopr give a reverse upsidown view) to the Mare Crisium. where it STOPED momentarily for about 30 seconds neer the crater Gauss and then WOOOSH it was gone in a split second. It must have gone to light speed or something, because it was gone in on time.;34.8792;-106.6946
