Bright white object in western sky just after sunset.;2014-09-25 18:45:00;10+ minutes;Bright white object in western sky just after sunset. I exited the Dairy Queen on S. 1st St. just after sunset, and looking across the street (approximately W or WSW, based on google maps) noticed a bright white object approximately 30-45 degrees above the horizon.  It was bright enough to be uncomfortable to look at for an extended period of time, and not noticeably moving. I asked a man sitting in his car if he knew what it was.  He got out and looked and was also perplexed. He went in and asked an employee to come look.  She also didn't know what it was.  It was still visible when I left approximately 10 minutes later. I have not personally seen a weather balloon, but would not be surprised to find out that it was a weather balloon reflecting the light of the setting sun, based on the direction, timing, and apparent lack of movement.;36.444;-103.1893
