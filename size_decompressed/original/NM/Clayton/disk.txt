have endured a low pitched motor hum for 24 years non stop;1997-06-18 02:30:00;20 minutes;have endured a low pitched motor hum for 24 years non stop we drove into an area illuminated as bright as daylight and saw two ufo objects--one on the highway and the other hovering above us.  there were no markings visable, we drove within 3 feet of the one on the highway. the size appeared to be 200 to 300 feet wide and about twice the height of a semi trailer. a tripod superstructure was atop.  there was brilliant light from many round windows but the interior could be seen as they were above the eye level nefrom our van.  the surface of the craft a metal but it had no shine,  as we drove away, the hovering craft shot upward at about a 45 degree angle,  within about 3 hours, the hum sound began and although it has at times become more distant, it has never stopped in 24 years;36.444;-103.1893
