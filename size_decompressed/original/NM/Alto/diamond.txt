This object was brighter than a star and moved quietly without making a sound.  It passed overhead at around 1000 feet and disappeared for just a second behind some trees.  The craft then made a hard right hand turn and shot away like a shooting star. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));33.4314;-105.6776
