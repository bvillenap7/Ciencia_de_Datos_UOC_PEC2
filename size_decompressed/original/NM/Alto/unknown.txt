We need to be concerned, I believe were under asalt. 11:40 p.m., June 10, 2015.  As I set outside on deck of my home in Alto, NM.  My attention was drawn to the noise of a military jet flying low, just west of my location.  To my amazement, I saw that the fighter jet was trailing 4 to 5 brightly lighted objects, but by no means could the jet keep up with the objects.  At that time I saw several other jet engaging what seemed to be over 15 to 30 or more objects moving in and around toward the west then toward the south and then back toward Ruidoso, NM, then the jets and objects moved toward the north east.   The jets in pursuit of the objects flew off toward north east of Ruidoso, NM, out of my view.;33.4314;-105.6776
