While on a walk around the local school track with my wife at about 2030 hrs I observed in the direction of west-southwest and to the right of the constellation Orion a large bright white flash which lasted 1-2 seconds.  I did not see any identifiable civilian or military aircraft beacon lights. Exact altitude unknown but my guess around 10,000 feet.  At about 2036 a second flash occurred this time in the center of the Orion constellation lasting 1-2 seconds. The. At 2045 a third bright white flash occurred  to the left of Orion. However after the third I observed what looked to be a dull shape remaining at the exact location of the flash. I continued to look at the dull shape then it seemed to go away or disappear.  The light was circular and reminded me of a photographers flash.  My wife did not see the flashes unfortunately. But did collaborate that no civilian or military aircraft was anywhere the vicinity of the constellation. Cannon AFB is located  southwest about 38 miles from us bury they rarely fly on Sunday nights. They do during the week have regular flight training paths over out small town.;34.8107;-103.298
