Odd light;2009-04-08 05:00:00;A few seconds;Odd light My sleep was interupted by a bright light above my garage.  At first I thought it must have been some kids messing around with a light. I looked outside and the light had gone and there were no kids around.  Just as I was about to turn around I saw a bright white light zoom into the sky from behind the garage. It chucked up lots of dust as it went up but was silent.  It was about the size of a football. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
