Triangular shaped objects with lights the same shape with red and gold coloring as well as the trail behind it.;2002-08-22 21:00:00;1hr 1/2;Triangular shaped objects with lights the same shape with red and gold coloring as well as the trail behind it. We saw at least 50 light in the sky behind a blinking object. It was not a usual air craft. It was red and gold and it menuevered very fast and shone as bright as a light bulb. They were all lined up right after the other.They were forming an unknown shape. They were at least 10sec. apart. It was triagular shaped and also had lights on the bottom ,they were also shaped triangularly ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witnesses to this event, and they sounded to be credible.  However, we had a difficult time understanding, with any degree of precision, what the object they were watching looked like.  They emphasized that it was distinct, and bizarre, in appearance, and it apparently maneuvered very fast, but it was visible for some 90 minutes.  We find it difficult to imagine an object, or cluster of objects, that satisfy all those criteria.  PD));34.459;-104.2322
