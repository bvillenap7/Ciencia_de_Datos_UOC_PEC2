6 Orange orbs in the sky in Lemitar.;2016-10-01 08:33:00;2 minutes;6 Orange orbs in the sky in Lemitar. I was driving back home with my children.  I have seen these before and last reported them 9/9/2010  9:40:03, but have seen them about three more times since 2010.  (I just never got around to reporting those)  Each time I see them they have the same characteristics and pattern.  The number of orbs is always associated with 3's.  This last time I saw two sets of three ( 6 total).  They burn bright orange and usually stay either on the same level or form a triangle shape.  They fade in and out one at a time until they all disappear. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));34.1561;-106.904
