During late afternoon, I had returned to camp at the foot of a mountain range after a day of hiking. I looked out over the desert basin that lies to the west and I noticed a light which sat motionless and changed colors white-yellow-orange-reddish. It seems to have been 10 miles away. The object then moved at an extreme rate of speed, much faster than any jet I have seen, and came to an immediate stop. There was no acceleration or decceleration. Only a complete stop or moving very fast. It would hover for a few moments and then move a distance and hover again. I watched the object do this for about 10 minutes. I turned my head and looked away for a few moments and it was gone. I never heard a sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));33.0691;-106.0075
