I WAS EATING MY LUNCH AT 1100 THE NEXT THING I KNOW I WAKE UP FACE DOWN IN THE DIRT. I WAS VERY SCARED IT WAS AS IF I HAD BEEN PUT UNDER FOR A OPERATION. IT WAS 0230. I JUMPED IN MY 4X4 DROVE LIKE A MADMAN TO GET OUT OF THE CANYON.AS I GET CLOSE TO ALAMOGORDO AT 0300 I HAD CALMED DOWN SOME. BUT LOOKING BACK IT WAS AS IF SOMETHING HAD TO ME IN MY MIND TO CALM DOWN. I GET HOME MY MOM WHO WAS 68 WAS UP. SHE ASKED WERE I HAD BEEN. WITHOUT THINKING I TELL HER I TOOK A NAP AT MY CLAIM. I NEVER TOOK NAPS IN THE DIRT WERE ITS OVER 100 DEGREES. I WENT TO TAKE A SHOWER AS I WENT TO TAKE MY WORK BOOTS OFF I THEN SEE THAT MY BOOTS WERE ON THE WRONG FEET. NO WAY DID I PUT MU BOOTS ON THE WRONG FEET THAN MORNING. WHEN I WOKE UP THE NEXT DAY IT WAS IF MY MIND WAS NOW BLANK ABOUT MISSING CLOSE TO 16HRS OF TIME. BUT I BECAME SCARED TO GO TO THE DESERT ALONE. WHEN I WOULD GO I WOULD TAKE MACHINE GUN WITH ME. I THEN STOPPED GOING TO MY CLAIM NOT LONG AFTER. ABOUT A YEAR AGO I STARTED HAVING VERY BAD DREAMS.

UFO shot down over Civilians?;2010-05-01 21:00:00;~30 minutes;UFO shot down over Civilians? 3 years ago, in roughly the late spring/early summer of 2010, around 9 PM, I saw something that I can't even begin to understand.  It's even hard to explain, just because we don't have the vocabulary for what I saw, but I will do my best to describe it to you.  Maybe (hopefully), one of your readers saw the same thing and can help me TO describe it. (lol)   First off, we live near an active Air Force Base and Missile Range, so hearing planes and sonic booms is nothing but background noise to us.  What made this night so unusual, was the number of planes SCREAMING over our house that late at night.  It literally sounded like a war was going on outside.  Complete with, what sounded like, explosions.  I used to be in the Army and supported the infantry guys, so I got used to the  sound of explosions, just not over civilians.  It got me VERY concerned.  I went out onto my back porch which faced the AF Base to see what in the heck was going on. I look out my back porch door, and saw what looked like a flare shooting up from the base.  I kept thinking, I know those things are bright, but there is NO way I could see a flare that well from this distance (approx 20 miles as the crow flies from their testing area to give you perspective).  I realized then that it was a missile they were shooting!  And from my point of view, directly towards civilian houses.  It hit something REALLY big.  This is the part I will have a hard time explaining, we really don't have words for this next part. When the missile hit whatever it was, and it looked like a dead on hit, it didn't act like any explosion I have ever seen.  This is the only way I can describe this so I'm sorry, but you know the movie Independence Day, when they shoot all the missiles at the ships in the beginning and it hits a force field?  It looked like that, without all the green special effects.  The explosion wrapped around whatever it was.  I could actually SEE the explosion wrap around whatever it was.  It was no plane I'd ever seen.  It looked like it was roughly the size of an aircraft carrier. with a weird cigar shaped looking front and no wings.   I saw the bits of the missile fall down and then nothing after that.  The next day they had helicopters everywhere in the direction of what I saw, and way more jets out then usual. So that's my story, it's definitely the weirdest thing I've ever seen, and even now my brain has a hard time comprehending what I saw.  It makes no sense you know?
