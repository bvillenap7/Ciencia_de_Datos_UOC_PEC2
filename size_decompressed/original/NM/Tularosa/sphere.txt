Glowing orb of light follows test sled and then shoots off toward viewer.;1996-08-08 20:30:00;35-45sec;Glowing orb of light follows test sled and then shoots off toward viewer. That evening I stopped at the intersection of US 54 and rattlesnake road.  It is parallel to the High Speed test track at Holloman AFB.  As I sat there to wait for traffic, I noticed that there was a test sleed firing at the the 9:30 position as I was facing due west. All of a sudden a purple or redish ball appeared and ran down the track with the white plume of the test sled. At the end of the first booster the ball changed direction and came straight at my position at the stop sign.  As I looked out the sun was in my face and the heat risers were coming up evenly and steady.  The ball, about the same size as the initial blast of the sled, but to the east of the track accelerated with the sled. At the first booster it began to accelerat at 3 to 4 times the speed of the sled as it changed direction toward my position. By this time it was going so fast that I could not track it with my eyes but the truck rocked gently and I saw the heat risers were disturbed as if someone had thrown a rock into a pond.  That was all I saw that day but a year or two later a friend passed on some mufon reports that mentioned an incident that brought the whole incident to light.  People returning from a day at the races in Ruidoso NM. saw a disc shaped object behind round mountain outside of Tularosa.  As they pulled over to stop and stare, balls of light from all over the basin rushed up to the craft and the craft then took off. This corresponded with the time and place.  If you draw a continuation of the line of this ball that I saw it would put you in the vacinity of round mountain.  end of report. ((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.
