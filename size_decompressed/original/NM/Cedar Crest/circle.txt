4 circular craft approached by USAF jets from Kirtland AFB;2010-11-15 06:30:00;15 minutes;4 circular craft approached by USAF jets from Kirtland AFB As the sun was rising, I looked towards the east.  My home looked over a large tract of national land and there were few houses out here.  I saw 4 black circles floating near the horizon.  They seemed to just hover there and not move at all for about 10 minutes.  I was looking from my upstairs balcony through a gass window so went downstairs to get a better view from my porch outside.  At this time, 2-3 jets came flying in from Kirtland. 2 of the circular craft just disappeared without a trace.  The 3rd one slowly trailed off and then disappeared.  The 4th one however started flying and then there was a large explosion that looked like nothing I had ever seen before - something like a Georgia O'Keefe lower opening up.  It seemed like it was going to crash nearby but I could not see if it ever did as it disappeared from sight.  I never saw this reported anywhere and sadly this predated iphones or else I would l have filmed it.;35.1316;-106.3589
