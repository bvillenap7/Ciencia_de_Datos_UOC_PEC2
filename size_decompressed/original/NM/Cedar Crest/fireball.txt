Very close to the horizon. I was walking our dogs with my husband around 10:00 pm on 9-22-98 . We live east of Albq. NM in the east mt. area to the north of the Ski slope at 7000 ft. I was looking to the south when I saw a super large ball of light with a tail 3 times longer that sparkeled. It was traveling due south. I have never seen anything as big or bright and so low following the horizon. It lasted 4 sec. I then turned to my husband and asked him if he saw it. Which he didn't . It was a clear night .;35.1316;-106.3589
