Single moving lights in the night skies south of Santa Rosa, New Mexico.;2014-07-26 04:00:00;30 seconds;Single moving lights in the night skies south of Santa Rosa, New Mexico I was stopped on a north bound entrance ramp to highway 84 south of Santa Rosa, NM.  I am not sure about the exit number.  I stopped to take a break and short nap at approximately 03:00.  I woke around 04:00 and noticed what I thought was a shooting star.  I was amazed at how clear and bright the stars were and especially how apparent the Milky Way was, because of the ultra low amounts of ambient city light. As I looked up in the general area of the shooting star, toward the west, I noticed what I thought was an airplane or satellite moving across the sky, but it was not strobing or flashing and appeared to be a solid white color.  It stopped all of a sudden and then moved for a short distance in a different direction.   The light disappeared and then I noticed a few others near the same spot in the sky moving short distances in different directions.   The duration of these moving lights only lasted for 15-30 seconds and I didn't see any after.;34.852;-104.5922
