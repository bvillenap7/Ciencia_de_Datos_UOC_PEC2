I was the only one left in jacuzzi after a night with the kids and family celebrating my wifeâ€™s birthday party.  I was star gazing in the northern sky in the direction of Santa fe, when I noticed some very dim yellowish lights in a triangle form.  These lights did not blink or flash and were around 7 to 9 lights that seemed to just hover in the horizon, they lasted there for only 20 seconds before they just disappeared.;35.2793863636363;-106.693295454545
