My daughter and I saw a triangular shape object with blue, then green, lights over some housing in Rio Rancho, NM.;2013-11-19 17:55:00;1 hour;on 11/19/13 my daughter and I saw a triangular shape object with blue then green lights over some housing in Rio Rancho, NM. To whom it may concern,  This is my account of what my daughter and I saw on the night of November 19th, 2013.  My daughter has filed her own report, per instructions of Mr. Davenport. Approximately 5:55pm, my daughter and I decided to go the store, and as we turned onto the next block to leave, heading north, we spotted two solid blue lights, evenly spaced about 200ft apart, right in front of our view, but about a mile away.  There was a red flashing light next to one of the blue solid lights.   The craft was moving very slowly to the north/northeast.  We figured it may be a normal aircraft, although we have never seen a craft, other than a helicopter, move that slow, so we ignored it and continued to the store.  On our way home from the store, approximately 6:48pm, I was looking out the car window, when I saw three green lights, triangular in shape, suspended about 300-350ft off the ground, staying in the same spot, again with one red flashing light next to one of the green lights.  It was just outside the window on the west side of the road.   I told my daughter to take the next road to the right, which has no lights, and when she asked why, I pointed to the lights.  She pulled over and I rolled the window down to take a video with my phone.    My daughter gave me her iphone, and I started to record.  Shortly after starting the recording, the object started to move away at a very slow speed, heading north/northeast. It started to move a little faster, but never just took off at a high rate of speed.  I recorded it until I couldn't see it on her phone any longer, at which time, we left and went home.   I have been completely dumbfounded since seeing it, and must say that I am still not sure what I saw, but I've never seen anything of this shape, with the ability to stay in one place, with absolutely no sound coming from it.   We have sent the video I took to Mr. Davenport, with ufo video by barnard as the subject, using the director@ufocenter.com address. Thank you, Albuquerque;35.2793863636363;-106.693295454545
Triangle UFO seen over Rio Rancho Residential Area (NM528);2019-12-16 18:43:00;5 minutes;Triangle UFO seen over Rio Rancho Residential Area (NM528) While heading Northbound on NM528 I observed two lights (mint green) quickly approaching from the West on my 10 o'clock.  I first thought it was a helicopter because it came to a complete stop over at my 10 o'clock, but as I got closer I noticed that it was triangle shaped w/ one red light and two green on the corners.  It stayed low and stationary but soon after it moved away going south at a high rate of speed.;35.2793863636363;-106.693295454545
