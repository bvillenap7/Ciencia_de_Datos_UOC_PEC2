When we looked on the video they seem to be glowing red.  And going up and down.  They all followed each other until they disappear one by one.   My boyfriend saw it first then ran to get me.  I called my brother and his friend.  We all saw the same thing not sure what it was;35.2793863636363;-106.693295454545
Unidentified foreign obeject was seen flying over New Mexico;2013-11-19 17:55:00;1 hour;Unidentified foreign obeject was seen flying over New Mexico 11/24/2013  To whom it may concern:  My mother and I decided to go to the store for some grocery shopping.  On our way to the store, we came to a complete stop.   I happened to look in the sky and see 3 blue lights.  They seemed pretty low to the ground, but thought nothing of it.  They stayed pretty even and straight, so our minds went to the thought of it being a plane just flying really low.   We went to the store, and went on with our night.  Coming home from the store, we looked up once again to see it in the same spot.   Knowing my planes don't fly this low, my mother requested I pull over.  I was able to pull out my Iphone before she got her phone up.  We sat there then recording it.   As we looked at it more, we began to see a squarish oval shape with the three lights evenly among the side of the plane as we recorded it more, it slowly started to move.  Slowly, it got faster, and moved towards the mountains.  We watched and recoreded it until we couldn't see it anymore. Sincerely, ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  Video is forwarded to NUFORC, but it appears to be ambiguous.  It shows a flashing red and/or white light, which moves across the sky in a fashion that is reminiscent of an aircraft on final approach for landing.  We will look at the two videos a second time.
