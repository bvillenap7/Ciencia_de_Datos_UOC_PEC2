The UFO was a sacer shaped, silver object.;2008-10-12 09:00:00;30 seconds-1 minute;The UFO was a saucer shaped, silver object. It was nine in the morning.  My cousin and I were taking a walk.  I happened to look up at the clouds and that’s when I saw it.  There was a metallic silver saucer moving slowly through the air. I quickly told my cousin to look up.  And sure as heck, I wasn’t imaging it. He saw it too.  I quickly took out my phone to try and get a picture, but right when I pushed “TAKE” the UFO disappeared into a cloud bank.  It looked as if it sped up to get away or something.  Later that morning, I was doing something in the living room and looked out the window.  There moving slowly across the sky was the same looking UFO that my cousin and I had seen a couple hours earlier. I figure it was probably the same UFO craft we’d seen two nights earlier. We had been watching a movie and glanced out the window.  Slowly moving over our yard was a torpedo shaped figure with glowing lights.  The lights were red, yellow, and green.  It was too close to the ground to be a plane.  Besides, there was no noise at all.  It took about one minute for it to finally disappear over the house.

Three disk appear in a photograph taken at a party with over 30 people.;2012-06-09 21:00:00;unk;Three disk appear in a photograph taken at a party with over 30 people. When I uploaded pictures from a graduation party at my house, the object appears in the picture.  I was on the ground pointing the camera up at the balcony where two party guest were getting ready to hang a pinata.  No one else was looking up & I did not see the disk and neither did the people hanging the pinata, it was only visible in the picture.  On close examination of the picture, you can see two other disk in the distance.   About an hour before this three military Ospreys flew over the area. Everyone saw them and watched them fly over because it is unusual for military aircraft to fly over our area.;35.2793863636363;-106.693295454545
