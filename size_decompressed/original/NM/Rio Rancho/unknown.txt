A long beam of light extending from a light in the sky towards the earth, which disappears suddenly.;2012-01-05 18:00:00;few minutes;A long beam of light extending from a light in the sky towards the earth, which disappears suddenly. I was travelling north along Unser Blvd, approaching the junction with the US 550, when I saw what appeared to be a stationery object high in the sky ahead and slightly to the left of me over the desert (i.e. slightly to the north west of that junction).  The thing that drew my attention to it was a long shaft of light beaming downwards towards the earth from it. It was a long shaft, not uniform in brightness but an increased intensity of brightness along it’s middle, extending downwards towards the earth at about a 25 to 30 degree angle from vertical.  The shaft thinned and feathered as it approached earth, not reaching the ground.  The object at the top of the shaft was no more than a light with no recognizable shape, about the size an aircraft would be at that distance.  I pulled over to look at it, and called my husband to see if he was able to see anything.  As we were talking I must have looked away for a second and when I looked up the light was gone.  I was shocked, and looked all around in the sky to see if there was any trace of it.  The only thing I saw was something like an aircraft with 2 flashing lights moving very fast in a southerly  direction well past me on my left, i.e. the western side.  It had a very long, straight stream of hazy white behind it. I don’t know if that was the same object.  If it was it had changed position exceedingly fast.;35.2793863636363;-106.693295454545
Unmoving pure white light turned to orange then faded over Rio Rancho.  ((NUFORC Note:  Helium-filled balloon at high altitude.  PD));2013-09-21 19:00:00;25 minutes;Unmoving pure white light turned to orange then faded over Rio Rancho, NM. The object was too small to clearly see the shape.  The sun had just set so the sky was light when I first spotted the object. It was larger than a star.  More like the size of a plane from a distance.  The object seen to the East of Rio Rancho,NM was pure, brilliant white.  It was not round but the shape was not clear. It may have been diamond shaped.  There was no movement.  As the sky darkened the object slowly turned an intense orange.  It then began to fade until it was no longer visible.  There was never any motion.  It remained in the same place the whole time.  It seemed to stay the same size also but as it faded it could have changed size.  ((NUFORC Note:  Helium-filled balloon at high altitude.  PD));35.2793863636363;-106.693295454545

Bright light was visible, then disappeared.   ((NUFORC Note:  Possible sighting of the flare from an Iridium satellite?  PD));2019-09-01 04:19:00;2 seconds;Bright light was there and just disappeared. At approximately 04:18 on the morning of Sept. 1st, 2019, I saw what I thought was a really bright star in the ESE sky at about a 35 deg. angle.  I thought it was Sirius until it disappeared.  Possibly a helicopter spotlight but didn't seem to cast a beam and the altitude would have been too high for it to hit the ground, I am also familiar w/ most of Law enforcement aircraft and they use FLIR tech here.  I have never seen anything like that in the sky around here.;35.2793863636363;-106.693295454545
