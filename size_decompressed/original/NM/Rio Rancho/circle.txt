The circle appeared to be slighly south of my line of travel, and about twice as high in the sky as the section of the mountain range it was directly over. This area is known as bear caynon and the mountain ridge is at about 9,000ft ASL,  I would say the object was at approximently 18,000ft ASL. The sun was back lighting the mountains as it was rising, at first I thought it was a weather ballon, because we witness them all the time in this area of the sky in similar light conditions.  The only problem with this is the object simply disappeared, no movement, just poof, gone. I observed this area of the sky for another 45 minutes and never saw it again.;35.2793863636363;-106.693295454545
Rio Rancho, New Mexico UFO spotted on Christmas Eve;2011-12-24 21:45:00;3 minutes;Rio Rancho, New Mexico UFO spotted on Christmas Eve My husband went outside to get a trashcan to put wrapping paper in for Christmas morning and saw glowing purple and red lights behind him. He could see the lights reflecting off the trash can.  He turned around and saw a very large round object swaying in the sky. He described it's movement as a fish swimming in water. He ran in the house for us to come out quick and look at this thing in the sky. My mother and I ran outside and saw the object. My husband informed us that it is much further away at this point.  It was like NOTHING I have ever seen before. Definitely no flying craft I've ever witnessed before.  It changed from purple to green to red to blue and swayed in the clear night sky. It went from up and down, side to side and did loops within seconds. It looked like a fiber optic light. It was not blinking it changed colors from one into the other. I made my husband run in the house to get a camera, by the time he came back out it looked like it landed f! ar away in the distance maybe toward the West Mesa. It was a trip, I still almost can't believe what I saw. Neither can my husband or my mother. Something I will never forget!;35.2793863636363;-106.693295454545

Bright white, round object in eastern sky seen from church doorway.;2013-09-22 06:20:00;40 minutes;Bright white, round object in eastern sky seen from church doorway. Bright Object in Sky Spotted From Church Doorway  This morning, at approximately 6:20, I was standing in one of the doorways of a church in Rio Rancho, and happened to spot a very bright object hovering in the eastern sky.  It had a round, circle shape and it never moved from that spot. The object wasn’t flashing on or off, just a steady bright white glow, and it wasn’t an airplane, otherwise it would have moved across the sky, which it did not. Other people were coming into the church at this time for services and I’m not sure if any of them saw it or if they did just ignored it.  It was still there in that same spot at 7 a.m. when I left the doorway. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
