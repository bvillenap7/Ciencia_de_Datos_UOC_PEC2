It looked like a satelite but moved across the sky from north to south much faster. It covered half the sky in about three to four seconds, then stopped for about a second, then did a half circle and then faded to nothing.  I have never believed in UFO sightings and have never witnessed anything like this.  It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  I just hope someone else saw it as well.;35.2793863636363;-106.693295454545

After about a minute of hovering, the light suddenly zoomed south, across the face of the Sandias, passed about the area of Kirtland AFB, and disappeared.  Covered the distance in about one second.   I was about 12 at the time, but I remember it vividly.  I had a good vantage point from across the Rio Grande Valley.  A mountain I look at daily.  I estimate the craft covered about 10 miles in about 1 second before disappearing.;35.2793863636363;-106.693295454545
Hovering bright light fades in and out.;2003-07-24 23:10:00;1 hour;Hovering bright light fades in and out. I am not sure of what we saw, but we believe it was a UFO no matter if from space or where ever...  We live in Rio Rancho and for about an hour or so, we have been watching a bright yellow/white light hovering over the towers on Sandia Mtn.  The light, thru the binoculars which appeared to be a pin prick, turned around so a red light of sorts showed, then it just faded 'off'.  There are/were no clouds over the mtn, and from our view point, it hovered, without moving for some time, up over the towers. It periodically faded out then would reappear not too far from the last spote we saw it.  It climbed higher and just to the right of where we saw it.  It appears perfectly round in our binoculars then a red light will spin every so often. It also appears to have something (light) come out of the top and/or bottom or both at the same time.  I tried to take some pictures and don't know if it will come out. But it just hovered and would get brighter then fade out for approximately 7 minutes at the longest before disappearing completely. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect that a celestial body would be the first possibility to be ruled out, but that is only a guess.  PD));35.2793863636363;-106.693295454545

As I was leaving the park, turning West, I noticed a red light in the Western sky moving slow and steadily from South to North.  I proceeded to drive and turn onto Sabana Grande Avenue.  This was when I noticed the orange hugh in the middle of the red aura.  I kept driving and turned left onto Riverview Drive and kept a watchful eye on this object. At first I thought it was a helicopter or plane because, at the right angle, you can see a light that isn't flickering, and, after some time, when they turn or keep moving, you cansee the flashing light.  I waited for this object to do so before concluding it was a UFO.  It never turned  and simply kept moving into the light cloud cover, dimmed, and vanished.;35.2793863636363;-106.693295454545

White light moving steady at a low altitude with no noise.;2016-02-02 18:50:00;10 minutes;White light moving steady at a low altitude with no noise. The light was in the distance west of my location.  I walked out to my backyard and seen a light coming from the west in Albuquerque.  As the light was getting closer, I noticed it did not have any flashing lights like you would see on an aircraft.  I thought it could be a satellite but way too low.  I see commercial planes at or below this height.   I ask a neighbor what it was as we watched this object of light moving to the northwest and when it passed it made no sound.  The movement was steady with no moves, just straight.;35.2793863636363;-106.693295454545
Blue lights flying across the Albuquerque night sky every 5 mins around 12AM;2016-08-12 12:00:00;10 seconds;blue lights flying across the Albuquerque night sky every 5 mins around 12AM I was looking at the night sky in my back yard and started to see blue lights every 5 minutes.  The first three flew north, then the the last three I saw fell from the sky towards Sandia casino at a hight rate of speed.   This is my 2nd time seeing these blue lights in the sky the first time me and my brother were on our way home on Corales Rd., and saw it cross the sky;35.2793863636363;-106.693295454545

We went outside to check it out because it seemed particularly low and loud, and it was maybe half mile or so above the ground, Using radar or something in the nose we could see the green light.  It was flying west to east at full speed as far as we could tell.  Once it got almost directly overhead, maybe 20 degrees straight in front of us, we noticed a light orb turn on, orange in color, about 200 to 300 feet in front of the helicopter get bright and then take off in front of the helicopter.  The orb was right on top of us again about a half mile up.  It took off East and then veered Northeast.  The helicopter sped up a little bit and went in pursuit.  We did see the light go out it seemed like it wasn't a flare or a missile, because it didn't come from the helicopter it came from in front of the helicopter turned on and then ! had a burst of speed and then turned off.  Not to mention there is desert/Mesa all around us why launch a missile over the suburbs?  There's no way that's what we saw.  Afterwards there was a squad of helicopters in the area which isn't very normal and we saw a drone as well.;35.2793863636363;-106.693295454545
