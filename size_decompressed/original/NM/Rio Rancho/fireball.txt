Sighted during the major meteor shower last year.;1998-10-01 04:30:00;2 min.;Sighted during the major meteor shower last year. My roomates and I were up, off and on all night and early morning to watch the major meteor showers that were occuring, and I can't remember what month that was occurring, to watch all the falling stars.  I went outside in my backyard about 4:30 a.m. to get another look as it was so facinating, when I noticed an object moving through the sky very quickly and it was white in the front and had an orange/bluish contrail.  I found this interesting as it wasn't falling from the sky, it was moving perpendicular to the Earth.  Then, I saw dark objects following it.  And how I saw this was due to the fact they crossed in front of stars.  One of my roomates came out and saw the objects following the colorful object. I don't know what we saw, but after having something else in 1993, I believe it was not of Earth.;35.2793863636363;-106.693295454545

The mysterious sound and wake of an explosion in Rio Rancho.;2016-12-16 23:30:00;10 seconds;The mysterious sound and wake of an explosion in Rio Rancho. We were just in the house, watching Netflix, and we had the sliding glass door cracked to the backyard.  I saw a bright orange flash of light and then we heard a very LOUD explosion and it shook the house and woke up one of the kids.   The alarms starting going off next door at the Good Will reception center.  It was at Southern and Unser Blvd.  We have friends that work at Wendy's across Unser and we called them and they said they also felt and heard the explosion, and it rumbled the floors there, too.  We called the neighbor next door and they confirmed that they too heard and felt it.  We saw about 10 police cars rolling around over at the Walmart and by the Good Will back entrance shining spot lights.   Today I went to look for an impact spot?  I found nothing!!  I suppose they found nothing too?  We do not know who called them?  But I bet some report was made?;35.2793863636363;-106.693295454545
