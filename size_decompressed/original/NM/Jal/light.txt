There were a few red lights that burst to a speed that seemed like light speed then disappeared.;2013-04-15 20:00:00;3-5 seconds;There were a few red lights that burst to a speed that seemed like light speed then disappeared. I was outside lifting weights at a drilling location where the rig I worked on was drilling a well. 2 of my friends and co-workers came up and were talking to me when I noticed a few (4 or 5 I believe) red lights in the sky traveling at a speed that appeared like a normal aircraft would travel.  The lights flew at this speed for about 3 seconds then burst forward at a speed that is far beyond anything we have on this planet that I'm aware of then disappeared all at once.  There was no noise from the UFO's and when they took off at the tremendous rate of speed it was what I would imagine the speed of light to be. This event took place in Southeast New Mexico right next to the Texas state line off of highway 1.  I believe it was early April, but I don't remember the exact date.  This sighting changed my entire outlook on the possibility of extra terrestrial life on earth.  You are welcome to contact me if you would like.

We witnessed a small red dot hovering in one spot for about 2 minutes there was a bad storm about to hit and the red dot would move in and out of the clouds disappear then pop up in a different spot.  Right before the fireworks show it appeared where they set off the fireworks, then disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.
