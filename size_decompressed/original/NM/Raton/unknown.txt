Observed unknown high speed, high altitude objects make non-balistic course changes.;1997-06-01 23:00:00;3 minutes;Observed unknown high speed, high altitude objects make non-balistic course changes. On the night in question, I was traveling with my mother and daughter to Las Lunas NM from Denver, CO.  We stopped for a few moments at the Ft. Lincoln Rest Stop, south of Raton, NM, to look at the stars with binoculars.  While my daughter looked at the stars with the binoculars I was using a 1st generation NVD and looking at the southern horizon.  I began tracking what I thought was a polar orbit satilite (from about 15 degrees above the S. horizon) I realized the object was traveling too fast for a satellite. (speed unknown but it covered from 15 degrees to 90 degrees in approx. one minute.)   As the object reached the 90 degree position it was joined by 2 other objects that matched vector and speed from the SW using non-ballistic manuvering.  The objects formed a triangular formation and traveled on for 10-20 seconds and then made a non-ballistic 90 degree turn to the west and accelerated until they were lost from view on the western horizon.  The objects were high in the atmosphere and undescernable as to shape.  The lights were very dim and impossible to see with the naked eye. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));36.8986;-104.433
