Green light that turn curves of mountains.;1996-08-01 02:00:00;15-20;Green Light That Turn Curves of Mountains Driving I-25 SB CO/NM border with 2 girlfriends.  1 asleep in back of van, 1 in passenger seat.  Turned the curve of the mountain and all the sudden the entire landscape in front of us was immersed in green light.  All of the hills and mountains.  Everywhere.  We stopped short to not enter the light.  Lower/ Upper Unkton style for fans of the Bundy's.  We were there in shock looking for some reason for it for about 10 minutes when it started coming toward us.  I dangerously reversed the van around the curves of the mountain and it kept coming at us.  Around the curves!  Then suddenly it took off at amazing speed the other way.  I don't think we spoke the entire time until we agreed not to tell anyone this.;36.8986;-104.433
