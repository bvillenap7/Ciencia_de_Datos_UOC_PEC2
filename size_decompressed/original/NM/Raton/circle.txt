Realized I was way too close.  Thought it might be a helicopter hovering with its search light on.  Realized it didn't have the red or green lights that aircraft and the light was pulsating.  Noticed it was slowly ascending and a snail's pace.   In the second video it was almost just above where that rocket looking things was launching vertical then drastically took a 90Â° turn and started flying horizontal and it was emitting a red orange smoke trail.  After the rocket disappeared the UFO continued into the atmosphere as the sun came up.;36.8986;-104.433
