7 bright lights over northeast new mexico;2006-10-01 23:20:00;30secs;7 bright lights over northeast new mexico At 11:20, I had stepped outside on my deck and caught something out of the corner of my eye.  I turned and saw 7 bright lights gliding silently in a northeastly direction.  There was no blinking lights, no tails like meteors. Just bright yellow lights that were bigger than stars and closer to earth.  I watched them for about 30 seconds and they faded away into the clouds.  They were travelling in a straight line.  I have seen some strange objects over the years, but none as spectular as this.  I felt that this was something I should report.;36.8986;-104.433
Seven Bright Lights in New Mexico Skies;2006-10-01 23:20:00;less than a minute;Seven Bright Lights in New Mexico Skies I have been a resident of New Mexico for almost 11 years and have seen a few unusual things in our skies, but nothing like what I saw tonight...nothing I've wanted to report.  My daughter and I were outside having a smoke break when she said, Look!  I turned around and noticed a bright light in the west, moving NE.  My first thought was meteor, although I've never seen a meteor that size.  As I watched, the light that appeared as a huge, gold star split into 3, then into 7 smaller stars.  They moved quickly and without sound, travelling in a straight line.  We watched them until we could no longer see them.  I called my local police department, but no one had reported anything.;36.8986;-104.433
