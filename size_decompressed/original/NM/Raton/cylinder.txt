UFO sighting just south of Raton, New Mexico, on Dec. 1st of 2016.;2016-12-01 07:00:00;5-10 minutes;UFO sighting just south of Raton, New Mexico on December 1st of 2016 I was driving through northern New Mexico, and I was in the middle of nowhere.  There were no vehicles, no building, no planes.  Nothing.  Just me and the road.   Suddenly a shimmering object appeared about 50 yards in front of me, just slightly off the ground and moving about the same speed.  After about 30 seconds, the shimmering cloak fell, and a UFO was revealed.  It looked more cylindrical than most pictures I have seen. I didn’t feel in danger.  It just kept flying in front of me.  Here I am in the middle of nowhere with no GPS, no phone, and no way to record what is happening, and a UFO is giving me an escort down a little 2-lane, windy country highway.   This lasted about 5-10 minutes.  It eventually cloaked, and then about 30 seconds later, it kinda “poofed” and I drove through the vanish.  It was the craziest thing I had ever seen.;36.8986;-104.433

It was there for about 15 seconds and caught my eye because it was revolving.  I was trying to look inside, as one of the windows? came into view, and it vanished.;36.8986;-104.433
