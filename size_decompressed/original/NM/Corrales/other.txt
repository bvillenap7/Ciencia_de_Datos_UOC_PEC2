The moon was out during the morning of May 13 after walking my dog, I decided to set up my telescope (Celestron 8 SE) for some daytime viewing and photos with my smart phone. I was using a 25 mm Plossl lens on the telescope and did not use any lunar filters.  Shortly after the moon came into focus and while I was viewing features on the upper visible half, a large craft traversed its surface moving left to right coming into view for no more than 5 seconds, then disappearing into the blue sky.  It was close to the moon as it was in focus while I was simultaneously looking at lunar surface features. it was large and and moving fast.  It only took five seconds to cross the entire width of the moon! Unfortunately, I did not have my camera set up at the time of the event to get a photograph of the craft.  The craft was shape of an arrow with the front side coming to a tip and the backside curved inward.  The arrow shaped craft was formed by wide-sections of tubular metal, silver in appearance, hollow in the center with all tubular sections of equal dimension. The craft did not appear to have any windows.  Just solid metal across the entire structure.  I did not see any lights or obvious means of propulsion (see attached drawing).  I would have reported the event earlier, but I was initially concerned that my information would be made public.  I was concerned that if my name was released it could have affected my reputation and future job prospects as a retiree.  I recently determined that my concern was unfounded, so I decided to report the event to the hotline.;35.2358;-106.6177
