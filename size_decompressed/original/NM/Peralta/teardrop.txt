Glowing tear drop-shape in the South West;2003-09-19 14:30:00;4+ hours;Glowing tear drop-shape in the South West The object slowly moved across the sky from south to south-west. I first noticed it at , about 2:30PM when I was working in my yard. It stayed in the same spot for so long that I decided to try to photograph it.  Then I forgot about it. However when I went up to  my office later that night around 7 or so, I looked out the window and saw it was still there and very bright. It was to the left of sunset so I figure it was lit up by the sun. Then it turned orange, and sort of faded. I assumed that it was a balloon because this is an area where hot air balloons are so prevalent.  But it was odd that it stayed there for so long. Usually balloon rides are relatively short. The other unusual thing I noticed is that the bottom/sides of the thing seemed to have some sort of energy that was distorting light, as if it were engine exhaust or something like that.  I just found out about the ufo reporting page and noticed that others reported it too. I *did* photograph it and put the photos on  my web site. However, we are asked not to  enter any names or contact info in this box so I don't know how to tell others where to view the photos. ((NUFORC Note:  We have altered the date above to 2003, which we believe is what the witness intended.  We believe our Online Report Form may be malfunctioning.  The object may have been a helium filled, high-altitude balloon.  We seem to recall a pulse of reports from the American Southwest of a balloon.  PD));34.8309;-106.6872
