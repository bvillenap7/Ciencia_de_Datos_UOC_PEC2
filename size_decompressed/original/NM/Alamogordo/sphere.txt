Bright Orange Orb traveled fairly quickly  across sky  then  hovered briefly and shot straight up.;2009-11-30 20:51:00;7 min;Bright Orange Orb traveled fairly quickly  across sky  then  hovered briefly and shot straight up. Possible UFO Sighting  Alamogordo New Mexico  On November 30th at 2051 Local time (As verified with my Atomic Watch) at my residence in Alamogordo New Mexico, I happened to step outside to check on the weather conditions.  Snow was forecasted for the evening. The weather was overcast with slight rain/sleet.  As I walked around to my drive way I happened on a Bright Orange Light in the night sky.  The object was North by East in direction. I wondered if it could be a meteorite. The object appeared to be travelling horizontally for a few minutes in a westerly direction.  I did not notice any flashing marker lights as usually seen by nearby Military and civilian traffic. There was no trail as found with meteorites. The bright object was below the cloud cover at this time.  I decided to go inside my house and get my wife and get my 8 X 40mm Tasco binoculars. At 2055 the object stopped in mid air just north of my residence.  The object was hovering at this point and my wife was observing it with the binoculars.  At this time the object was just above the cloud cover.  At 2057 my wife went inside the house due to the cold and to attend to our kids.  I continued to observe this object for another minute and it appeared to gradually lose its orange brightness and slowly fade.  It appeared at this time to be going straight up and in a matter of about three seconds disappeared completely. I looked at my watch and noted the time to be 2058. The Orbs brightness was brighter than any aircraft I have witnessed in my 22 years in the U.S. Air Force.  The brightness was equivalent to it being on fire.  I observed the object before it ascended above the cloud cover with the binoculars.  I did notice a variety of red almost pink colors toward the rear of the orb.  No sound was heard. No other aircraft in the sky were visible.  This was a very eerie experience. I then contemplated calling the local Base (Holloman AFB) to report what I had seen.  Being a retired Air Force member myself, I realized this would be a waste of time.  Who do you call at now 2110 at night??  I talked with my wife who is a complete skeptic on the subjects of UFOs.  She mentioned to look for a web site that takes reports of sightings.   I contacted the National UFO Reporting Center by phone and was instructed to file a detailed report.;32.8955983050848;-105.948218644068
A large red/orange orb, hovering over the area of Holloman Air Force Base, disappeared and reappeared several times.;2014-12-23 18:00:00;10 minutes;A large red/orange orb, hovering over the area of Holloman Air Force Base, disappeared and reappeared several times. I was walking my dog in my neighborhood.  It was a cold, clear night.   As I crossed a bridge, I looked up in the sky to the west and noticed a large red/orange orb hovering stationary in the sky.  In terms of size, I estimated it to be large, probably at least 25 meters in diameter, it seemed to be hovering about 200 meters over the area of Holloman Air Force Base, which is about 12 miles away, and was noiseless.   I wasn’t sure what to think at first.  I had never seen anything like it.  I kept looking and was amazed when it moved instantly, effortlessly, and noiselessly about 50 meters to the right.  It hovered there for about one minute, then disappeared, so I continued to walk and turned in an easterly direction, thinking that was all, but I turned back to look and it was there again, then disappeared.  Again I walked, turned around and it was there, watched and it disappeared.  This happened once more before it disappeared altogether. I am 55 and have lived in Alamogordo for most of my life.  I've been teaching for 26 years.  I have never seen any UFOs before or since. It was an intriguing experience, but not frightening.  I wasn’t going to report it, but changed my mind. It was very interesting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));32.8955983050848;-105.948218644068
Orange orbs fly over neighborhood.;2016-02-07 22:00:00;2-3 minutes;Orange orbs fly over neighborhood At 8:00pm, my husband and I were sitting outside in our back yard. I was looking up in the sky admiring the stars facing northeast when a orange orb came over our neighborhood from west to east.  It had a steady slow speed without making a sound.  At first I thought it was a fireball since it was very bright in color.  As we watched it pass over us and toward the mountains, it held its course of direction and speed.  After about 3-4 minutes, another orange orb came over the same flight path, with the same speed.  It was heading in the same direction as the first one.  It too, flew over the mountains and we lost sight of it. This is not our first viewing of the orange orbs in our area, however it is the first time they were this close to our neighborhood.;32.8955983050848;-105.948218644068
Outside @~ 8:00pm on the E bench of the mountains above the city.  We noticed some orange orbs flashing on and off north of the base.;2016-02-22 22:00:00;5 minutes;We were outside around 8:00 pm on the east bench of the mountains overlooking the city. Our view was the entire basin/valley.  It was a very clear night with no winds or weather.  To the direct west is Holloman AF Base. We noticed some orange orbs flashing on and off north of the base.  They moved at great speeds across the valley.  They stopped on a dime, would dim and then light up.  A few would sit together in a formation and then turn off and move to another location where they would flash on again.  We watched them for about 5 minutes, until they disappeared totally.

We saw 2 orange orbs stationary, side by side on the horizon.  Within seconds, the first orb disappeared, then the second disappeared.;2016-02-25 21:25:00;5 minutes;Thursday night at 9:10, four us were leaving the movie theatre on the north end of the town, as we looked toward the west side of the desert valley, which is an open desert area.  We saw 2 orange orbs stationary, side by side on the horizon.  Within seconds, the first orb disappeared, then the second disappeared.  There were a few tiny flashes of blueish-green light afterwards, however they never came back on.  We watched the sky as we drove southeast to the bench of the mountains.   15 minutes later, we were driving west and 5 orange orbs suddenly came on into view again.  It was as if someone turned on a round light in the sky.  They were in the air and just turned on, one by one.  They were stationary in the sky.  It was hard to tell how high they were but they were very visible and plain to see.  We pulled our vehicle over and watched them as they flashed on and off.  There were 5 that sat in the sky above the city.  Then before they left, we had continued on home and didn't watch them anymore, so I do not know how long they were in the area.;32.8955983050848;-105.948218644068
