Large Triangular Craft Silent and Void of Any Light. Darker Than the Night Sky over NM.;1997-03-15 22:00:00;1 minute;Large Triangular Craft Silent and Void of Any Light. Darker Than the Night Sky over NM. I was in 9th Grade at the time. I was out on my back porch on the phone. I always stare up at the stars at night (a weird habit of mine). As I stared up at the night sky I noticed a Large Triangular Object with absolutely NO Lights. It was darker than the night sky and blocked out a large portion of the stars. It was absolutely silent. It resembled something like a Hang Glider but extremely large. Almost the size of the old Stealth Fighters, but again was completely Silent and void of any light. It passed over in a slow glide in a Westward Direction. Seemed to be only a few hundred feet above me.;32.8955983050848;-105.948218644068
Witnessed a large object with lights, changing size, pausing in front of me, changing direction, then going down behind a mountain.;2001-12-01 21:15:00;about 5-10 mins.;Witnessed a large object with lights, changing size, pausing in front of me, changing direction, then going down behind a mountain. My neighbor and I were standing in front of our houses looking due east.  It was a clear , full- moon night.  I saw a rather large red light, rather low,  in front of the western border of the Sacremento mts, which are across the street from my house..  It was moving slowly in a northern direction above and in front of us. Then I could see three lights, as with a stealth fighter plane. The lights were red and possibley blue and green.  I said it's too low and slow for a stealth and it made no noise. It continued to move in a straight line due north.  At this time it appeared to be about a few inches, visually, above the house roof across the street. So it was low, still not a sound.  My friend has excellent hearing. It was just to our right when it stretched out and there were a series of colored lights- red, blue green, yellow, and not in a staight line.  From a few, there appeared to be a vapor-like trail.  As I looked at it , it was about 6-8 inches long in my field of vision, of course it was away from me and up, so it was actually many feet long. The lights were in up and down positions, not in a single line. THEN, the object again resembled a stealth, with a few trailing lights. It started slowly turning on its side,like it was banking to turn.  At this time it was directly in front of our line of vision.  The object got large, about 3-4 times the size of a stealth and had three lights on the underside- red, blue and maybe green.  The underside looked whitesh or light grey.  It PAUSED in front of us, in that position. My friend then ran in to get her husband.  The next thing I saw was it going behind Hershberger Peak, which is directly in front of my line of vision.  There were only a few colored lights at this time.  There was a large orange, glowing light which wasn't there before.  It was about 3-4 times the size of the other lights I had seen and there was a long straight vapor-like trail.  It went behind the southern edge of the peak at about a 30 degree angle. Just moments before it had been way in FRONT of the mts., right behind my friend's house.  So it changed direction, and moved straight east , about 5-7 miles to Hershberger Peak.. Neither of us have ever seen anything like this before.  We are both trained teachers. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness, and found her to be quite sincere.
