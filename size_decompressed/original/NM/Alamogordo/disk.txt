AS MY GIRLFRIEND AND I WERE GOING TO THE STORE, WE SAW (1) VERY BRILLIANT 'WHITE' SAUCER SHAPED OBJECT SHOOT ACCROSS THE SKY IN FRONT OF US, IT CAUGHT US OFF GUARD SO BAD WE PULLED OVER ON THE SIDE OF THE STREET AND STOPPED TO WATCH. ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT STOPPED IN MID-AIR, IT STAYED IN THIS SPOT FOR 5 MINUTES! I KNOW, WE TIMED IT. THEN WITHOUT A SOUND, IT WENT STRAIGHT UP, AND WAS GONE. SHORTLY AFTER AND ON WAY TO THE STORE WE SAW AN ORANGE AND WHITE HELICOPTER,PRESUMABLY FROM HOLLOMAN AFB,GOING THE SAME DIRECTION,LOW AND SLOW.WE'RE USED TO SEEING STEALTHS, PHANTOMS AND BRITISH TORNADOES FROM HOLLOMAN AND F-16 FALCONS FROM KIRTLAND AS WELL AS ALL KINDS OF OTHER AIRCRAFT AT NIGHT OVER HOLLOMAN AND WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE. THIS WAS LIKE NOTHING WE'D EVER SEEN.;32.8955983050848;-105.948218644068
Grey Metallic Aircraft Floating Behind the Clouds.;2000-09-09 20:30:00;5 minutes;Grey Metallic Aircraft Floating Behind the Clouds. I was with two co-workers and we were traveling west on highway 70, heading to White Sands. We noticed large cloud formations to the north of us. As we were observing the clouds we all noticed a gray metallic object floating next to the clouds. We pulled over on the side of the road and took pictures. The floating object was visible for approximately 5 minutes then disapeared behind the clouds. The film was developed on 10/6/00. Two pictures show the object very clearly. It is similar to the picture on the homepage of this website. I also have to conclude that we did not hear any noise from the aircraft. Pictures will be submitted.
