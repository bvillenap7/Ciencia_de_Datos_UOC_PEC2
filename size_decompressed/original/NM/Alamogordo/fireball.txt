This is 2 instances of the same type ufo, the first one occured late 2010 around 10pm. I was leaving the house when a light cought my eye, i stared at it for a moment and it was getting rather large very quickly, it seemed it was headed straight for me, i actualled yelled at a family member for fear. by the time they got out the door, the fireball had grown , holding arms length the size of a pinky nail. At that moment it shot straight up at a right angle and amazing speed, it left a short light trail behind it turning into a star like object and left our atmosphere, this thing traveled so fast it was crazy. I had called my friend at that moment and he saw it also! On the other side of town, he was just as estatic as me.  The object was traveling NE when it was in the fireball stage. The second incident was Sept 17th 2011.  Same type ufo, I did not witness this one, but the same friend that witnessed the last one saw this one.  His girlfriend and her son was sitting outside aroud 9pm and they noticed and yelled to my friend to come outside.  Same description this time the fireball was traveling SE.
