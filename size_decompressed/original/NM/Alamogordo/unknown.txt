Two objects gliding in circles over Alamogordo.;2014-05-16 22:30:00;20 minutes;Two objects gliding in circles over Alamogordo. Two objects seen in night sky, changed colors randomly, white, red, green and blue. Most often appeared white or red.  Objects were bright, and seemed to glide in circles separately.  No discernable patterns to color changes or movement.  After 15-20 minutes, objects seemed to drift farther away and then out of line of sight due to neighborhood trees.  The objects seemed very close at none point during the sighting, but made no sound.;32.8955983050848;-105.948218644068
Spotted 21 points of light flying in identical flightpath in ~45 second intervals.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-14 05:45:00;15 minutes;Spotted 21 points of light flying in identical flightpath in ~45 second intervals. I was smoking this morning on my balcony and spotted a light moving pretty fast from SW to NE over Alamogordo. I wouldn't have thought much of it, other than it was weird that it was not blinking and seemed to be going faster than I would expect from an aircraft, but over the next approximately 15 minutes, I counted a total of 21 lights flying in the same path. They all flew the exact same speed and in roughly the same line.  The reason I thought they were going fast was they were small points of light and not blinking, so it wasn't like seeing a regular aircraft.;32.8955983050848;-105.948218644068
