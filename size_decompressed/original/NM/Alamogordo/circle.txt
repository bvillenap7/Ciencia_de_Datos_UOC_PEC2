Orange orbs appear over Alamogordo, New Mexico.;2015-05-07 21:00:00;5 minutes;Orange orbs appear over Alamogordo, New Mexico. Driving south on hwy 54 outside of city.  We observed 2 bright orange lights hovering low in the sky, below the mountain range line.  They were over the desert to the west of the city, moving slowly.  As we watched the orbs, they blinked off, as if to shut all power off, then they would reappear in a different area and hover orange again.  The lights continued to blink on and off in the stationary position.  After a couple of minutes they both went dark and disappeared.  We did not see them again in the sky anywhere.   Friends report that they have seen the orange orbs in Alamogordo on Wednesdays, Thursdays and sometimes Saturday's, and most always around 830-1000pm.;32.8955983050848;-105.948218644068
