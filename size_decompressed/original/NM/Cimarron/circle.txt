In the late summer of 1985,  I worked at ((deleted)) Ranch and was pulling into cattle headquarters around midnight or so.   I was riding with a friend and as we pulled in there was another truck stopped and the driver, our supervisor,  was speechless and just pointing directly above us from his drivers seat.  We craned our necks and could make out something quite large and round passing , what seemed like, directly above us.  What was weird was that it wasn't making any noise.   There seemed to be light on the edges.  You could just feel its presence.  Suddenly, it accelerated in a westwardly direction.  We all began to follow it.   It was travelling well to the west of the road we were on and I lost sight of it completely at this point. By the time we had pursued it a few miles , we noticed it joining three other like crafts above Urraca Mesa.   That was where we stopped and just watched.  They began to move in formations.   a box...then a line....all the while moving at incredible speeds.   Then just as quickly as we saw them manuvering ...they all exited ...following each other in a line up Urraca Canyon.   They exited to the west.   We stood there in silence then went back to the bunkhouse.   I asked the supervisor about it a few years ago and he says that he has no memory of such an event.;36.4574;-105.0697
