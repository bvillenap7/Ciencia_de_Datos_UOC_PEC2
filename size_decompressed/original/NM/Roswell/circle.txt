I looked up to the east sky and noticed 4 orange circular orbs.  2 faded out and then came back bright as ever.   I then saw one of them lower slowly into a long stretch and then turn into 2 orbs.  They seemed to be blinking.   One by one each faded out quickly.;33.4832500000001;-104.464575
Lights blinking in sequence across the dark Nothern sky.;2017-11-13 19:00:00;20 minutes;Lights blinking in sequence across the dark Nothern sky. Four lights and at times up to eight round lights blinking  in sequence across  the dark  Nothern sky, 30 miles west of Roswell.  The lights would glow really brite then blink back and forth then dim and go black.  At one point one bright long light lit up with approximately 12 smaller lights around it in a perfect circle, expanding a very big portion on the sky.;33.4832500000001;-104.464575
