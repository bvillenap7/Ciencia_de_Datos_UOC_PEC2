All of a sudden a bright, pulsating blue, diamond shaped object appeared to our right.  At arm's length,  it appeared to be an inch in size.  It blinked twice and the next time it blinked it was 12  inches further right and continued in that pattern as it headed toward Roswell.  I looked out the back window of the car and it disappeared over the Roswell skyline.  It was very startling when it appeared because it came from no where.  It was suddenly just there. Object traveled north and pulsated a couple of times then moved approximately 12 inches (at arms length) to the right of where I was and then pulsated again.  It did this until it disappeared over Roswell.;33.4832500000001;-104.464575
