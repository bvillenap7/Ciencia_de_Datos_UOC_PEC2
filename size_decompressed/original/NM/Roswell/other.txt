SR-71 Blackbird seen near Roswell?;2014-08-18 15:00:00;15 seconds;SR-71 Blackbird seen near Roswell? My brother and I were on motorcycles headed South on HWY 285 about 35 miles from Roswell (what a weird coincidence) on our way to Austin.  Both of us were raised by a retired USAF pilot, and we both know our military airplanes.   We both spotted an aircraft moving from West to East above the highway in front of us (as we looked South ahead of us).  It moved at the speed of a jet fighter, probably going about 500 mph at 1-2 thousand feet.  Our view of the craft was a look at the side profile.  When each of us saw it we both thought that:  1) the color was black, on a sunny day with no clouds, and 2) The profile was a dead ringer for an SR-71 Blackbird.    We immediately discussed it on our CBs and found we had both thought the exact same thing, an SR-71.  I thought they were all decommissioned and went to the internet when we got home today looking for info that they have activated an SR-71.  I know the old  Roswell AFB has a very long runway.   Could the government be bringing one of these to active service based on what has been going on in the world recently?  What a good place to test them.  If anyone saw a test, they could claim its another Roswell UFO nut.;33.4832500000001;-104.464575
