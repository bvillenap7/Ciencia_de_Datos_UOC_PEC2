low iredescent  V shaped light;2001-07-18 21:00:00;2 minutes;low iredescent  V shaped light For the mere fact that I live in Roswell it's a little hard to report this, typical responce would be , Yeah.......right.  I was at work and went outside for some fresh air. Had I not been looking up I probably would have never seen it, because it was very dim. I have a hard time calling it a craft because I didnt see any structure to it.  It was in the shape of a V and it just materialized in the night sky.  It was stationary when it appeared for maybe 30 seconds then slowly began to move south then it just disappeared, no sound no lights no colors. It looked the same as if it were a spotlight on the clouds, a dim kind of grayish look, but with very distinct lines forming the shape.  The thing that really got me though was the way it appeared, how it just materialized right in front of me, then disappeared the same way.;33.4832500000001;-104.464575
