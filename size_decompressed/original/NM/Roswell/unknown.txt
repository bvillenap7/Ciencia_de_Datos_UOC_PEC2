3 high speed objects caught on film.;2001-10-31 20:00:00;photo;3 high speed objects caught on film. November 7, 2007   Dear NUFORC folks, hello. My name is ((name deleted)) and I have a photo that I believe you’d like to view. I am 60 years old, own my own business, an avid photographer, amateur astronomer, and by no means a crackpot. Photo  taken on Halloween night about 9-10 pm, 2001, facing east by south east , from a parking lot at the intersection of College and north Main, Roswell New Mexico. It was a full moon hiding behind some high clouds that caught my eye, I almost always have a camera with me, so I took a snap with my little Olympus with 35mm lens 1:2.8 400 film. All  I saw through the view finder was the clouds and the moon. I never saw what turned up in the photo. What ever it was, it had to be extremely fast to appear as lines on the photo and not to be noticed by myself.  I see them as 3 objects, a white large leader and 2 chasers, one smaller than the other and of a different color, almost blue. That’s it , what’s it look like to you ? I’ve been wanting to show this to someone, I tried to contact some people at nasa.gov/apod/astropix, all I ever got was a dead end, unless you knew some one there, they didn’t want to look at any picture from some guy from Roswell, good grie !  If this goes well, I have another. ThanXs,     ((name deleted));33.4832500000001;-104.464575
Humming, oscillating sounds outside of Roswell, NM;2002-09-03 22:00:00;2 minutes;Humming, oscillating sounds outside of Roswell, NM While camping at Bottomless Lakes State Park outside of Roswell, NM, my girlfriend and I heard a strange, high-pitched, oscillating sound coming from the west.  We heard the sound for about 30 seconds and got up from our campsite (out from under some trees) to investigate.  The sound was making area coyotes/dogs howl like crazy.  The object had a red light on one side and a green light on the other, and white lights on the front and back.  The red and green lights were about a third of the way between the white lights-- if you connected the lights, it would look like a kite.  So basically, not terribly unlike a plane, but a different shape. However it did not sound like any plane we'd ever heard.  It was traveling relatively slow and low and went directly over us.  As it did, due to the Doppler effect, the sound became lower and the oscillations slower.  We followed it until it disappeared into the horizon. We suspected it might be a B-2, but saw one the flying the next day outside of Alamogordo and it did not sound the same at all.  Based on subsequent Internet research, we're pretty sure it wasn't one.  Actually, as an aside, it sort of sounded like the opening music on the MUFON website (www.mufon.com).;33.4832500000001;-104.464575
Unidentified Circle of Light accelerates and disappears at very high altitude;2008-08-04 21:53:00;4-6 seconds;Unidentified Circle of Light accelerates and disappears at very high altitude My Wife noticed a far away light Moving Up above and slightly north.  she asked me immediatly to look and see since the light was moving seemingly fast, and was far away compared to the normal high altitude aircraft we see.  When I looked up I saw light about the size of the stars around but it was more of a solid circle than the fuzzy stars. The Object was moving not too fast in my opinion at first, but moving  Slightly to the Southwest it picked up speed very rapidly and the Mostly white with a blue haze vanished or it almost seamed to give off a sigle Dim flash effect, like that of a old lightbulb going out.  I had looked at the time right before my wife asked me to look and the time it took was definatly not more that 6 seconds, I would say 4 seconds is the correct length of time. I know it hard to judge altitude but after observing other planes and even high flying jet fighters in the area, that the object appeared ither in the sub-atmosphere or farther out into space.  But there is not really and way of knowing it actuall distance. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous  provides no contact information.  PD));33.4832500000001;-104.464575
Weird lights in Roswell.;2017-07-19 23:30:00;5 minutes;Weird lights in Roswell. We were driving through Roswell at approximately 11:30 pm on our way to Santa Fe on US Hwy 285.  My daughter noticed a flashing sequential light pattern to our right in the woods.  The white lights were dancing around and when we felt like we were driving up on them they would move out of reach.   There was also a light red light that appeared to be floating around. We thought it may be someone playing with a laser light beam, but the way it swooshed past us was unexplainable. We videotaped it and kept driving trying to catch up to it and it kept dropping around in different locations.  At one point it moved to the other side of highway. ((NUFORC Note:  Video indicates multiple strobing white lights, seen against a nighttime sky.  We do not know what the source of the lights might have been.  PD));33.4832500000001;-104.464575
