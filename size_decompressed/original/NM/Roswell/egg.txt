The pilot announced that we were on descent just over Nevada bordering New Mexico at 37,000 feet above sea level.   I was on the left side of the plane, window seat A7.  At the moment I was looking down there was a strip mining in progress which looked like huge targets on the ground.  Out of the corner of my eye there was a white, shiny object coming towards the plane below us at a rapid speed.  It was traveling from East to West at about 170o and moved out of sight in 3 seconds.  It looked no bigger than a dime at an armâ€™s length.  A minute later there was a an airline parallel to us traveling in the opposite direction.  This airplane was flying very slow in comparison to the first object.  It must have taken 60 seconds to move out of my view whereas the shiny object covered the same in only three seconds. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite serious-minded and credible.  PD));33.4832500000001;-104.464575
