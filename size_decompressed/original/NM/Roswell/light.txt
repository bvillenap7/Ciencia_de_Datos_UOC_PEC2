High, fast moving, silent light flew horizon to horizon and was followed by 2 military aircraft within minutes, then filled the sky.;2004-05-13 21:00:00;3-5 min;High, fast moving, silent light flew horizon to horizon and was followed by 2 military aircraft within minutes, then filled the sky. I am an amatuer astronomer, RC aircraft pilot, with a BS in psychology and a BS in Theology and 3 years graduate study in anthropology/ethnobotany.  I saw a light about the size of Saturn in appearence fy West to East overhead and it grew to about the size of Venus when overhead.  I had a pair of 8X35 binoculars I was going out to look at comet NEATS with.  I could not resolve a shape even though I was hoping to resolve an aircraft.  It was extremely high and fast moving, about 1/2 the speed of a satalite at least.  I thought it was the Space Station at first and asked my wife if she wanted ot see it.  She declined and I realized it was not at all what I thought.  There were dead-calm conditions and it was completely silent.  About 5-10 minute later 2 military fighters flew over (I could hear them, well sounded like 1 but was 2).  I am familiar with the stealth sound and various looks and also some other aircraft that have not been publically discussed.  I have watched them for months with abilities and conditions not normal in understood conventional aircraft.  After a while the skies were full of aircraft (jets) and at that time the weather changed radically (maybe totally unrelated but occured).  My wife, a special education teacher for 8 years, will verify I asked her to come out and look at somthing odd.;33.4832500000001;-104.464575

Large orange lights north of Roswell, NM;2009-08-05 20:45:00;35 seconds;Large orange lights north of Roswell, NM   My brother from Oklahoma (who didn't believe in this stuff until tonight!) were Coyote hunting 15 miles north of Roswell, at 20:45 while facing North, my brother said Look at the UFO!   This HUGE string of square/Oval shaped orange lights were moving in concession eastward,   First 2 then three the the whole thing lit up to the east like a craft you see in the movies.  It lasted 35 seconds then just disappeared!   It was well defined.  It looked as it was ONE object, and it was HUGE, we are not intelligent enough to make something that large fly.   I live in Roswell, and always think the people talking about this stuff are idiots!!  Never again will I think that!!  This was the most amazing thing Ive seen in my 32 years of life!!WOW!!  I actually cant believe Im writing this!!  I'm very familiar with aircraft, Scientific balloons and what not, this thing was so big!!  Nothing man made!   Minutes later a fighter jet (from Kirkland?) was seen flying at high altitude east over the area where we seen the lights!  Very weird!;33.4832500000001;-104.464575
A light in the sky moving in a zig-zag pattern;2011-09-04 19:50:00;3-4 minutes;A light in the sky moving in a zig-zag pattern At Approximately 7:50 pm four of us were playing with puppies in a neighbor's yard, when one of the group shouted, Look at this and we all moved to the front of the yard for a better view.   A bright starlike light was moving away from us.  The light did not blink nor did it have any red marker lights like an aircraft, but the most unusual aspect of its movement was the fact that it was moving right to left as well as moving forward away from us.  The lateral deviations were slight, but very distinctive and apparent to the naked eye.    The light was visible for 3 to 4 minutes, before disappearing behind a stand of trees, forming the horizon.;33.4832500000001;-104.464575
Strange light, hovering in NM sky.;2015-04-02 01:00:00;2 hours;Strangr light, hovering in NM sky. At around 0100 MST I noticed a strange, pulsating light. This light flashed red, and white, and appeared to be moving in various zig-zag, up and down, circular, and back and forth patterns.  To confirm the object was moving, I placed my thumb 2-3 inches in front of one eye, and closed the other.  Sure enough, a few seconds later, the light moved back into view.  To ensure the natural movement of my body did not effect the test, I tried again twice, yielding same results.  Afterward, I went inside, and used the blinds as a reference point. I repeated the test 3 times, all yielding the same result as the previous test. I proceeded to try signaling with a flash light, which yielded a few distinctly brighter, white flashes from the bottom portion of the light.  As I write this report the light continues to hover around the same coordinates as when I first sighted it, yet appears to be becoming dimmer, as if moving away from my location.;33.4832500000001;-104.464575
2 green navigation lights were seen crossing highway 285 20 minutes north of Roswell, NM.;2015-11-04 19:14:00;10 seconds;2 green navigation lights were seen crossing highway 285 20 minutes north of Roswell, NM. I was driving north from Roswell tonight on HWY 285 heading back to ABQ.  I was approximately 20 minutes north of Roswell at approximately 7:14 PM, when I caught a glimpse of a green light on the west side of 285 heading east.   It immediately caught my attention, so I leaned forward toward my windshield to get a better look and I noticed that there were 2 green lights.  1 seemed to be following the other.  2 distinct aircrafts.   These green lights resembled the same red and white navigation lights found on a commercial aircraft, but these green lights belonged to a much smaller, much more agile aircraft and they did not blink, they remained the same intensity. I immediately locked up the brakes and came to a halt on the right shoulder of the road.  I killed the radio and rolled down my passenger window to try to hear what the crafts sounded like but I could hear nothing. I could only see the 2 aircrafts for a few more seconds before they disappeared.  These 2 green lights were approximately 1/4 mile in front of me on 285 flying at approximately 300 yards off the deck.  Their flight pattern did not resemble that of a fighter jet, a personal jet, a commercial aircraft, nor a helicopter. I have experienced the Rip sound of a combat jet flying directly over me while driving in northern Nebraska and this was nowhere close to that or the sound of a helicopter. These 2 crafts were either a new military concept that obviously must be tested at night under the blanket of darkness or they were UFOs.;33.4832500000001;-104.464575
2 separate instances of 3 orange lights appearing/disappearing;2016-01-26 19:45:00;10 seconds;2 separate instances of 3 orange lights appearing/disappearing We witnessed 3 large orange lights appearing, disappearing and moving horizontally in different directions almost if they were sliding left and right and changing opacity as they did so. We saw this happen twice. The first instance:  Our family was traveling west outside of Roswell heading to New Mexico the evening of January 26th, 2017.  Approximately 20 miles west of Roswell we spotted 3 large, very strange lights in the northwest sky.  We immediately knew these were not normal.  These orange lights hovered in the sky as they sort of whispers or danced with each other fading in and out.  We could not make out any physical shape that was generating the light.  There is nothing out here.  We've travelled this route several times. It was extremely dark at the time.  We could see that the stars went down on the horizon as to rule out the lights being on top of high terrain.  Additionally, there are no radio towers here.  This experience lasted about 15 seconds.  My wife and I both saw this. The second instance happened once we arrived in Ruidoso just as we passed Ruidoso Downs.  We pulled over to get water from the cooler for the kids.  I immediately noticed the same 3 lights in the same configuration as before acting in the same way!  I motioned for my wife to witness the lights.  This lasted about 7 seconds.  I'm not the kind of person to report this kind of thing, but this was a very real and distinct experience that we cannot explain.  For us, it was diffinitive proof that we are not privy to everything that happens around us.  It was one of the craziest things I've ever seen!;33.4832500000001;-104.464575
Large, bright unidentified light in the western night sky over Roswell, NM.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));2017-01-21 20:30:00;30 minutes;Large, bright unidentified light in the western night sky over Roswell, NM. I have been seeing this light in the Sky pretty much every night for the last few weeks.... It looks like an amazingly bright  close  star.  I'm an avid star gazer so I immediately noticed this oddity.  The first time I saw and watched it,  I didn't leave the site of it and after about 20 minutes it brightened a great deal then disappeared.  I've never seen that again as I have not watched it constantly again but I will spot It, go about my business checking  on every 5 minutes or so and at some point  look out to see that it's gone.  I have taken pictures.  Three  on  01/20/17.  Two tonight,  01/21/17.  It is strange looking when I zoom in.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus.  PD));33.4832500000001;-104.464575

Three lights in the sky over western Roswell, New Mexico, flashing lights in sync appeared to be amber in color, lasted for about 35 seconds to 1 minute.   The lights were round in shape, bright, but not overly bright.;33.4832500000001;-104.464575
