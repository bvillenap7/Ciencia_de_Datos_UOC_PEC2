Orange balls of light on US 285, just north of Roswell, New Mexico.;2020-09-30 20:15:00;45 minutes;Orange balls of light on US 285, just north of Roswel, New Mexico. At approximately 20:15 my wife, child, and I. were traveling south on US. 285.  We were south of Vaughn, NM.  We witnessed several orange balls of light. They were a little bit lighter than a street light in color.  These objects were about twice the size of a star. As we drove south towards Roswell, NM, we noticed them.  They would disappear for about three to four minutes at a time.  They would reappear in the same way, which is to say, it was like flipping a switch off and on. As they sat in the sky, they were about the distance of your hand sideways at arm's length off of the horizon.  The objects were to the west of US. 285. This is a clear night with little air traffic. they would reappear and multiply. At one point there was no less than six visible at a time. . All of them stayed in the same general area. They did not fall towards earth as would a flare, or fire work.  When they would multiply, they would do so by moving horizontally.  The hole sighting lasted ap! proximately 45 minutes .  Starting at 20:15, and ending at approximately 21:00 New Mexico time.;33.4832500000001;-104.464575
