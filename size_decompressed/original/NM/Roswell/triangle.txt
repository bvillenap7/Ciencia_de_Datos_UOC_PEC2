A large triangular shaped craft appeared seemingly from nowhere and crossed in front of us very slowly from east to west. We didn't notice any lights or sound.  It was flying very low to the ground and passed directly over our path.   My husband is an electrical engineer who grew up in the air force the son of a USAF pilot and had served 11 years himself before getting out and going to work for defense contractors and performing EMP/EMI/EMC testing on military aircraft.  He knew this was not a stealth or any other known military aircraft.   My brother in law who was traveling with us served in the Air National Guard and had photographed dozens of military aircraft as a professional photographer, he did not recognize this craft either.   After crossing over us the craft suddenly accelerated and was gone.;33.4832500000001;-104.464575
Helicopter into a triangle at Roswell;2000-12-06 18:16:00;5-6 Minutes;Helicopter into a triangle at Roswell At approx. 6.16pm on December 6th 2000, I was standing on a porch having a ciggy, facing south, I spotted a light in the sky pointing towards the ground, looked like a black helicopter with a light coming from the front, I saw a red (port) and a green (starboard) I watched this object coming towards me and heard not a sound coming from it, I still thought it was a helicopter. I called out my friend and my wife who both saw what I saw up to this point. It was still coming towards me but started drifting away to my left and came to a full stop about 800 yards to my left, and not a sound from it, both my wife and my friend watched as something peculiar happened, the object changed shape as we watched, it sort of dipped and as it did it turned into a triangle both red and green lights vanished, as it did from off centre of this triangle came a very bright flashing strobe light which was pulsating, next we saw three bright white lights in the shape of a triangle these lights clearly showed the shape of this object. As we saw the triangle it reversed itself and silently disappeared in the same direction I had seen it approaching. This sighting lasted for approx.5-6 minutes, witnessed for part of the time by two other people, I reported (On a report form) this sighting the next day at 11.50pm, at the International UFO Museum in Roswell at the next day.

Dark Triangle, silent craft floating with 3 lights on the bottom heading NNE over SW Roswell between July-Sept 2001;2001-08-15 22:00:00;3-4 minutes;Dark Triangle, silent craft floating with 3 lights on the bottom heading NNE over SW Roswell between July-Sept 2001 While dribing to get purified H2O for my baby, I saw a triangle craft with 3 lights in a triangle pattern flying very low, 200ft+/- over a church 2 blocks from my house.  I obeserved it flying NNE.  I decided to try and follow it.  I made a turn E and followed it for several blocks and it changed direction ater a minute or two.  I then turned to follow it N, and it changed direction again.  I made a final turn and I assume was noticed following it and it instantly accelerated and within less than 2 second was on the far NNE part of town.  Going in that direction it easily could be headed toward Cannon AFB, and coming into Roswell from the direction of White Sands Missle Range (SW of Roswell). ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
