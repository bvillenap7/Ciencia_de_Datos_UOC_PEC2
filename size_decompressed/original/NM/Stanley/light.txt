Blinking red light over Stanley, NM.;2017-11-30 18:25:00;10-30 seconds;Blinking red light over Stanley, NM. At approximately 6:25 pm on 11/30/17, I was driving south on Highway 41 and in the town of Stanley, NM.  My approximate speed was 50 mph.  As I approached the intersection of Stanley road, a large, blinking red light appeared from the west.  It was traveling at a high rate of speed and very low to the ground (just above tree level).  It literally came out of nowhere, just before it passed over Highway 41 (and over my car), heading due east.   The land around Stanley is flat, and you can see for miles.  I don’t know how I could have missed its approach, and after it passed overhead, it didn’t take long (maybe 10 seconds at most) for it to travel 3-5 miles. I didn’t stop my car, and I kept looking to my left to observe the light as much as I could.  The last time I saw it, it was near the horizon and had either landed or was very low to the ground.   Worth noting: the moon was still in the eastern sky, and it was very bright and illuminated the sky quite well.  Even with this illumination, I couldn’t make out anything other than the light itself - I couldn’t see any shape to determine if this light was attached to an airplane or helicopter.  I don’t know of any aircraft that ONLY have one, large, blinking red light, though.;35.1295;-106.0283
