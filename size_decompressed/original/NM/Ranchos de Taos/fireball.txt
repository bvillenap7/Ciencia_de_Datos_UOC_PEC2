Large westward moving blue-white meteor  18:34 MT seen from Taos, NM;2012-11-04 18:34:00;~3 seconds;Large westward moving blue-white meteor  18:34 MT seen from Taos, NM This was almost certainly a large meteor.  It was a very bright white (nearly blue-white) ball.  It appeared directly overhead and headed straight west at high speed covering 30 to 35 degrees of sky in approximately 3 seconds.  It then appeared to simply go out, which I assume was its  burning up in the atmosphere.  I have witnessed many meteor showers and this was very similar.;36.3372;-105.6104
