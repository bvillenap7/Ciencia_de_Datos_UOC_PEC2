It had sharply defined borders and appeared to be made of metal because once the sun started setting the light was reflecting off of it making it appear to change color. I had an uneasy feeling and my gps started malfunctioning. I took two videos in the area (one of the craft) ten minutes apart yet the location stamps marked them as being almost two hours away from each other. I would have pulled over to take a clearer video but I had a very unsettling feeling that I shouldn't do so as there was hardly anyone around.  I did see a truck pulled over on the side of the road with a man who was staring at it.   craft didn't appear to be moving, but it was clear that it was, just very slowly.  I was able to keep it in sight for 45 minutes to an hour before the sun went down and I couldn't see it anymore. I had my cat in the car and she was freak! ing out and meowing loudly for about half an hour as we drove under it. I had a feeling of being watched and the rest of the drive took me much longer than it should have. Very confused about that part as it seems I lost a couple of hours. I was experiencing a lot of neck pain afterwards and when I finally got to a motel to sleep for the night (around midnight) I woke up a couple of hours later with excruciating neck pain. No dreams either which was strange for me but then again I didn't sleep that long. Turns out I sprained my neck somehow.;34.1696;-105.5326
