lights seen outside Corona NM;1988-07-15 00:00:00;4 min;lights seen outside Corona, NM West I-40 outside Corona NM.  Mother and I were driving back from Ok. I saw a set of lights in front of me that I thought were vehicles crossing over I-40 on a bridge heading south.  It looked like a large white cross shape with the long stem of the cross going first, it was followed by 2 smaller red shaped crosses.  We were approaching at an upward slant since were climbing the hill outside corona, but when we got to the top we realized there was not a bridge over I-40 there.  As we reached the crest and started down we could see the lights heading south along a ridge line till they went out of sight.  As we got closer to the town of Corona, we passed by a vehicle stopped along side west I-40 and a man standing outside his car{looked like a VW wagon} looking down south watching the lights.  A whilr later we caught a program that was showing pictures of a ufo in Belgium and it was what we saw that night, We both agreed to what we saw that night.  I am not for sure the exact date or year-but it was close to that time frame. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD));34.1696;-105.5326
