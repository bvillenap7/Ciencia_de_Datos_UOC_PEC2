An object that was a bright white light wobbled acrossed the sky. It came from the southwestern sky and went right over us. There was a airplane (flashing red & blue lights, which was west bound) that appeared to be higher than the object. The object seemed to be moving slower than the airplane. It was heading to the northeast and it seemed to accelerate and then slow down. During the acceration, the object wobbled. We watched it for about 5 mins. Then, it faded out. It left no trace.;36.7377;-108.3514
