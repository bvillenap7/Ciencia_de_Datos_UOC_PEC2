We were almost done for the night and about 12:50 a.m. my oldest daughter said, Dad, what is that!  I looked in the sky to the north east and there was three circular lights in the sky.  They were orange in color like the color of an incent lit.  We observed these objects for about seven minutes.  I even tried to record them on my ipod but it didnt come out to good.   About five minutes into the sighting the two outer objects began to move up towards the middle one.  I forgot to mention they were in a triangle formation.  Then the outer objects began to disappear behind some clouds, but the object in the middle was still visible and bright.  Then it started to slowly move north, then it to disappeared behind the clouds also. Me and my children were freaked out about what we saw.  We will never forget that night. I'm a father of four children, two girls and two boys. My oldest daughter is eleven. My other daughter is ten.  My two boys are five and one years old.  There is no way that we are lying about this since my children saw the object with me.  I have seen objects in the sky before.  It was just surprising to see the objects with my children present.;36.7377;-108.3514
