Massive bright lights over the plains of New Mexico on a object that is not normal in this world .;2009-06-01 21:03:00;10 seconds;Massive bright lights over the plains of New Mexico on a object that is not normal in this world . Monday June 1st 9:03 pm I was driving north of Dora, New Mexico to Portales, New Mexico 16 miles away, 4.5 miles north of Dora a massive white orange light to the northwest caught my eye from the left side. I turned to look at it and it faded away and then it reappeared for about 6 to 8 seconds. It never appeared again. It looked to be about 6 football fields long and the width of a football field x 2 high. This thing was approximately 10 to 12 miles away about 9:00 high in the sky. The sky was clear with exception of 2 or 3 small feathery clouds to the west. It was stationary in the sky. This thing was so massive that it is hard to explain. It will get your attention. There was another car in front of me about 300 yards that pulled over and was looking at it also. They left before I could drive up and ask them what they saw. My son, who has been a little skeptical about UFOâ€™s also saw this from his driveway 11 miles away from where I was, but I will let him tell you what he saw.;34.1825;-103.3304
