I don't remember the exact date that this occured, but it was sometime in the spring of 1999. I was standing in my back yard smoking a cigarette when I saw a v shaped formation of 7 lights (the upper arm had four lights, the lower three) at about 45 degrees above the horizon to the east. They moved approximately south to north, with no sound, and were of equal color, size, and luminosity as the stars in the background. They moved at about the speed of an ordinary jet aircraft at relatively close range, and I observed them briefly before my line of sight was obscured by trees. I thought it unusual that there were no blinking or colored lights that you would expect to see on ordinary aircraft. My only guess is that they were a formation of stealth fighters, or a single stealth bomber from Canon AFB. My initial impression however, was that the lights represented a single object that was larger than a single fighter and relatively close based on it's speed.;34.1825;-103.3304
