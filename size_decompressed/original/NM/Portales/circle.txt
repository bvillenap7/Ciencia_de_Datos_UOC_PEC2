It was monday night and i was sitting outside smoking my cigarette with my cousin, i happened to look to the left into the sky when i saw this huge bright orange circle with grey around it, it appeared as the thunderstorm was coming then disappeared after a few seconds, this was no dairy light, tower or aircraft. i saw the same thing again the same night only this time a bright light blue/white orb looking thing was emitted from it. this appeared after the thunderstorm.;34.1825;-103.3304
