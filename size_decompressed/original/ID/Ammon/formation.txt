((Starlink satellites));2020-03-05 22:00:00;2 minutes;24+ lights all synchronized, moving at incredible speed in space. Appearing and disappearing Standing in backyard, me and two others saw several lights appear out of nowhere.  Then travel across the sky at very high speed, and disappear.  Faster than any man made aircraft.  All appearing at same point, and all disappear at same point.  Mostly sets of four, perfectly set apart.  All traveling in a line.  These objects appeared to be very far away, in outer space.  This continued for about 2 minutes.  Lost track of how many, but had to be at least 24 or more;43.4777;-111.9726
