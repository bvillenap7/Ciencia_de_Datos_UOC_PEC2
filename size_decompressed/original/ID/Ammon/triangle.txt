((NUFORC Note:  Possibly not a serious report.  PD))  Black Triangle UFO spotted and had a encounter.…;2005-10-15 04:00:00;25 minutes;Black Triangle UFO spotted and had a encounter.... Huge Black triangle with 7 dim lights were spotted when I was sitting outside having a cigarette.  The lights were arrow pointed meaning one frontal light in the front where the point is, then following 3 lights on each trianglaur side... Around 4AM, The Triangle craft was coming from the south apparently from the hills not far from here, it slowed down and it was hovering right above me.   It shined a bright blue beam at me then I felt dizzy.  After that, the lights in the apartments were flickering as I looked.  Then the triangle craft slowly went backwards towards the south then it disappeared. There was no sound whatsoever. I was finishing my cigarette, then I saw a another black triangle ufo flew by very fast heading north from where it was located from.  It could be the same one.  Then I went and got my gun, ready for war... however, nothing happened. no sound.. nothing. I would like to be anonymous in this and see if other people in this area have seen this as well... something strange is going on over here.
