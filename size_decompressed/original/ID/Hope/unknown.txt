Object that gave off a changing red/orange/green light.  Very large.  ((NUFORC Note:  Venus or Sirius?  Anonymous report.  PD));2017-02-01 21:02:00;Few minutes;Single object that gave off a changing red/orange/green light.  Very large object seen because it was far away over the hills to the southeast side of Sandpoint.  Was seen over the lake.  I have seen this light on multiple occasions and I can't figure it out.  It's mindboggling.  It's too big to be an airplane or heli and moves around and changes color too much to be a planet or star. ((NUFORC Note:  Venus or Sirius?  If in the SE sky, probably Sirius.
