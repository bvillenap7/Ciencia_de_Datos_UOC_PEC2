The craft or object was silent and stationary over fernan late just east of town, probably five miles out and just above the mountains in line of sight looking eastward.  I took my eyes off for a second or two and the craft had moved almost out of sight, but also stood stationary, till we decide to go into the house a few seconds later.  Strange, not acting like an aircraft as I know of or had observed.;47.7173427152318;-116.782926821192

As I scanned the sky, I saw a very long straight line of what appeared to be randomly connected lights.  Whatever this was wa incredibly long.  It seemed to be high in the sky, but I have no way to know its altitude.  I actually thought it could have been a mile or more in length.  But, if it was lower than it seemed, it would still have to be a few hundred feet in length. It moved what seemed to be slowly, but I really have no idea since this would depend on how high or low it actually was.  It was almost above me when I first saw it and I watched it continue in the same direction in what seemed to be a straight path.  I watched until it disappeared.  If it was 1 light, I would have assumed it was a satellite.  Unfortunately, I did not CV count the lights, but I estimate around 10 lights randomly spaced.  I have seen 2 other very unusual things in the night sky over the years, but this was by far the most unusual.;47.7173427152318;-116.782926821192
