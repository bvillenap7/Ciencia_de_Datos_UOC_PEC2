Extremely bright flashing white light low above city.;2013-07-24 23:00:00;Five minutes;Extremely bright flashing white light low above city. I'd like to start out by stating that I live up on Cherry Hill which overlooks all of the city. Last night I got dropped off at the bottom of the hill because my friend's car couldn't make it up. I had my brother meet me at the bottom.   When I got to the hill, I noticed a huge, extravagantly bright light. Brighter than any we even have in the city. It pulsated at about a flash per second and this lasted for about 5 minutes.  I caught this on film but the videos do no justice to the size and brightness of this flash.  It was just in the air right above the hospital lights and aircraft warning lights (which blink red and WERE the brightest thing in the sky until this strange light).   Soon after the light disappeared, four helicopters immediately circled the area for a good 10 minutes.  They dispersed and and another two helicopters came and circled the area even wider. Last, one more helicopter flew around in 2 circles around the area and tool off. I have heard no ! reportings on the news whatsoever and I still want to know what this was.;47.7173427152318;-116.782926821192
