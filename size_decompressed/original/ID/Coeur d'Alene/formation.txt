I will first have to apologize that I no longer have the exact date and time to provide as full an information as possible.  However, it was at least 3 or 4 years before the death of my dad, who was the other witness to this phenomona.  3 bright lights that did not move as airplanes and lined up one after the other.  Precisely, they flew in laze curves. Secondly, I have seen the standard gear on planes to know a jet, or a helicopter from an object that puts out a blinking white glow or a solid white glow.  A UFO doesn't resemble a jet or a helicopter.  And it is very easy to tell them apart.  A UFO will actually fly higher and faster than the commercial jets.  Dad and I used to spend many hours on summer evenings looking for the space ships when I was a kid. Finally, of this night in question, not meteors, meteors leave trails.  Nor do they closely trail each other low in the sky over the area near CDA.  They do not travel as though they were manned.  I have seen meteors too, they do not act as UFOs.  Folks, I neither hoax nor joke.  Dad is dead now, but I still remember this event very well. In closing, how well does a weather ballon shine at night.  Does it have an internal light source?  How fast do weather balloons travel to out speed air force fighter jets?  The attempt to debunk becomes ludicrous on the facts.  Further, how fast can Venus travel if you are laying down and watching the night sky and see Venus blinking and moving very fast from one horizon to another from the north to the south, to the east, to the west.  Isn't that strange behavior for a planet? ((NUFORC Note:  Date in 1996 is approximate.  We have assigned an arbitrary date in June 1996.  PD));47.7173427152318;-116.782926821192
