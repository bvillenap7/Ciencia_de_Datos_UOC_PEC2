The craft descended toward the base of the mountain  out of sight.  There was enough light coming from the craft to dimly light up the trees on the side of Canfield.  We have not been able to confirm if the craft touched down  due to the private property that lay at the base of the mountain.;47.7173427152318;-116.782926821192
