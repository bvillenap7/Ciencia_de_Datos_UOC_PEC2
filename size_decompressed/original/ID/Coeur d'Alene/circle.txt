I say unfortunately, because I needed to find the date that I saw this, but I have no real record of the report.  No email, text anything.  Apparently to even search the database on MYFOn you need an account...and to have an account you need to make a donation. So, I found NURC and started searching.  I found very similar experiences in my area about the same time, so I thought I would enter the incident for your database. It was around midnight and my husband and I were looking up at the stars, as we often do. It was a fairly clear fall night, with just a few clouds.  I was looking straight up, I mean the back of my head was resting on my spine, it was literally straight up. My back was towards my house, I was standing about 2-3 feet from our 2 story house, we live on a hill overlooking the city. From behind me, straight over my head  from the other side of house (NE) towards the downtown area (SW)  - A silent huge circle with no lights was slowly moving over our heads. I tried to get my husband's attention but he didn't see it in time. It was slow-moving kind of Blended in with the night sky and disappeared into a few clouds. It was very stealth like but it seemed like it was right above our house.  I was standing directly underneath it. The next day, I was in that same spot by the house using our house when I noticed all these red spots along the wall window water spicket and leaves of bushes. It was only about a 10 to 12 foot with of the house directly where the craft had passed over the night before. I got up my camera and took some video of these odd shaped red droplets.  I even tried to squish one and it seemed like it was blood coming out of it I was weirded out.  I posted it on YouTube and that’s where I get the approximate date of 10 months ago.  To this day’s some of those red spots are still there.  I don’t know if it’s related or not but I found it very interesting.;47.7173427152318;-116.782926821192
