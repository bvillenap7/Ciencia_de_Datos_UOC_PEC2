See a glowing golden orange light in the sky. I was out for a hike in the hills near Coeur d Alene, Idaho around 6:00 pm.  I was on the east side of Tubbs Hill facing south over Lake Coeur D Alene.  I decided to head down to the edge of the water and sit down.  I looked out over the water and saw a glowing golden orange light.  I asked the friend who was with me what planet it was.   I then realized that it was moving slowly.  I saw little twinkles around it as it moved slowly westbound across the sky, like little shooting stars.   My friend and I both acknowledged its movement and then tried to figure out what it was.  I had heard about other fireballs from a co-worker who frequents this site and then thought about posting this story.   We left before Tubbs Hill before the glowing golden orange light left our sight.;47.7173427152318;-116.782926821192
Two bright orange craft flying in formation;2014-09-25 18:30:00;4 minutes;Two Bright Orange Craft Flying In Formation I walked out onto balcony to smoke and two bright orange fireballs flying, one following the other, as if intelligently controlled, however no sound was apparent.   Both craft traveled in a northwest direction at approximately 5000 to 6000 feet elevation.  Both craft disappeared after passing our 90 degree aspect.   These we're NOT conventional aircraft, as I am an ex-military air defense artillery gunner and a trained observer.;47.7173427152318;-116.782926821192
