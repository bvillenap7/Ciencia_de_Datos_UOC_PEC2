I lit a cigarette and the craft in the front flashed a bright blinding light at me then it dimmed down and all three crafts continued on their route.  I see unexplained activity in the same part of the sky often I started noticing these lights years ago & I'm not sure what is going on.  But there seems to be more activity lately. Kinda thinking there's some kind of colony in the woods some where close.  They fly too low to be unheard at the speeds they fly at major chance to see them is middle of the night look towards Sanders & Wolf lodge wait to find a what would be a constellation moving maybe you will catch the dancing lights as we'll!;47.7173427152318;-116.782926821192
