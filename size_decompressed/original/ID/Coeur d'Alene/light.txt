It moved slowly right in the sky and then the light became increasingly bright.  At the very climax of the brief illumination it vanished, to return no more.

As soon as I recognized that it was too bright, the light began to move as though it was seemingly startled, then in an instant the light shrunk and disappeared, it appeared to leave in a curve-ball type motion out into space.

Changing colored lights on object viewed from Dalton Gardens possibly traveling low over Coeur d'Alene, Idaho to the south.;2006-02-09 18:35:00;5 to 10 minutes;Changing colored lights on object viewed from Dalton Gardens possibly traveling low over Coeur d'Alene, Idaho to the south. Returning home to Dalton Gardens, Idaho, area after spending the afternoon walking to recycle aluminum cans.   Stopped by Prairie Avenue Mall for 2 free papers.  And then heading east on Prairie Avenue spotted a very large bright light low over the vicinity of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.   A very large white blaze that was moving slightly faster than a hover, very low and directly to the south. Traveling in an east to west direction.   Then the large bright light disappeared to be replaced by a dimmer red glow.  And then from a dimmer red glow it became a very large bright light again.   Standing on Prairie Avenue to watch it and then having to move to keep it in sight.   Second witness:  blond haired woman living on Prairie Avenue coming out with a bag of trash.  I called her over to look at the slowly moving light that was now a red glow.  She asked if it was a plane or a helicopter.   I thought this light did not act or move like either. Then she suggested a UFO.  Do not know her name but she lives in blocks of my home.   In a matter of seconds of her joining me to watch this light, it began to pick up speed and then disappeared.;47.7173427152318;-116.782926821192

On August 24, 2008 at approximately 9 pm, I was on a dinner cruise on Lake Coeur D Alene, Idaho with my wife and another couple. I was looking up at the stars and noticed what I thought was a satellite.  This star light then stopped directly over head in the vicinity east - southeast of the big dipper. It then moved in several directions, always returning to what appeared the original stopping point. On two occasions, it grew very dim, then grew back to the original size.  I am not sure if this was because it was moving farther away or lower below the horizon of the sunlight or earth shadow.  I was telling my friend what I was seeing and he finally saw light move as well.;47.7173427152318;-116.782926821192
Bright light that dimmed out;2012-06-20 22:20:00;10 seconds;Bright light that dimmed out The sighting occurred on June 20th at around 10:20pm in Northern Idaho.  I was looking at the stars and noticed a very bright star at about 30 degrees off the horizon straight south.  It looked about 5 times larger and brighter than the next brightest star in the sky.  It looked like it was moving very slowly to the west and then a flashing light that appeared to be a plane passed a few degrees below it going east.  At that point the bright star seemed to reverse course for a very brief period and then dimmed out at about the speed you would see a light on a dimmer go dark, not instantly.  It was then completely gone.  Perfectly clear night.  The entire sighting lasted maybe 10 seconds.  I watched the area of the sky for another 10 minutes or so and never saw anything else.  If I didnâ€™t see the movement, which was very minimal, I would think I had just witnessed a star go supernova.  Although, I have no idea if that would dim out that quickly.

Quiet night on the boat interrupted by shaking and bright lights.  (Husband's perspective);2016-05-06 22:26:00;1 minute;Quiet night on the boat interrupted by shaking and bright lights.  (Husband's perspective) My wife and I took our sailboat to Beauty Bay in northeast Lake Coeur d' Alene, ID.  We like this part of the lake because it is secluded and quiet this time of year, with buoys that we can tie up to.   We arrived at about 8 pm and went to into the cabin to sleep at about 9 pm.  No other boats were in the area and there is only 1 house on the bay. At 10:26 pm, I woke up to the boat rocking back and forth pretty intensely, like it would if caught in a storm.  The water in this bay is still and calm, even in the busy part of the year, so I was concerned.  Still in bed, I glanced around the cabin and saw white light coming in from the port side windows.  The boat was still rocking hard, which then woke up my wife. She was scared, and I turned my attention to her.  She said, Oh my god, I think someone's on the boat, did you see that light?  I was looking at her, and away from the cabin entry door, which she said filled with light as though from flashlights from someone above us. She asked me to go check it out. By that point the boat stopped rocking, maybe 15 seconds after I woke up.  I grabbed my phone, turned on its flash light, and tentatively opened the overhead sliding door.  I looked around the cockpit of the boat, and saw nothing.  The water at this point was perfectly calm and the area was awash in silence.  Everything appeared normal and there was no sign of intruders.  I turned to look at the bow of the boat and saw nothing. Up in the southeast sky (or maybe south west, I don't know which direction the boat was pointing at the time) I saw a bright white light that I at first thought was a helicopter.  The light shined down toward my area, but was rotating in circles, as though looking for something.  The craft was relatively low, just above the neighboring hills, possibly lower as it made its way over the bay. The craft made no sound. I assumed it was a helicopter and retreated back into the cabin. We woke up in the morning at 7:30 and talked about the night, trying to rationalize what happened.  I can normally explain events with science or justify them with surroundings, but this time I had nothing.  What rocked the boat in a calm, lonely bay? What filled the cabin with light?  What was the silent craft pointing it's light down toward us?  My wife called the local police, who said there were no helicopters, police nor medical, in the area.  They also called Spokane, who also didn't have any activity in the area.  The lady on the phone recommended we contact the UFO reporting center, which is something I never thought I'd need to do. I am 39 years old and own a marketing company.  I'm college educated and have never touched drugs, nor do I drink alcohol. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with both the husband and wife, and they both sounded to us to be quite sober-minded people.  We suspect that they are highly reliable, and capable, people.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESSES, FOLLOWING RADIO APPEARANCE ON JUNE 01, 2016.) Bright light and rocking boat on calm waters. ADDENDUM to original report by ((husband's name deleted)) and ((wife's name deleted))  There are a couple of pieces of additional information I feel we should mention. The boat rocked hard at an estimated 15 degree angle, back and forth port to starboard roughly every second for about 15 seconds.  After the boat shook, my husband said the water remained glass-like and perfectly still.  He was on deck just seconds after the boat became still, yet the water showed no turbulence or other signs of disturbance. After checking the boat for intruders and scanning the bay for other boats, ((husband)) noticed the light in the sky and watched until it faded away.  He said it was about the altitude of the surrounding hills and smaller than the full moon but very bright.  The light was likely in the southeast sky moving northwest.  (Determined by the most likely positioning of the boat in the water.)  The light didn't streak or shoot away, just faded. ((husband)) then came back into the cabin assuming it was a helicopter. I questioned why it wasn't making any noise and wondered where it went after he lost sight of it, but we didn't have an answer. After the incident occurred, we crawled under the covers, held each other, and both fell back to sleep very quickly.  Morning came in a flash.  The relief in knowing there wasn't anyone else on board our boat was comforting and the bizarre circumstances didn't begin to alarm us until we had time to ponder the events when we woke up. In addition, we were awakened by the chirping of at least a dozen birds the next morning.  When I finally peeked out of the cabin door, I had to take a video because there were birds chirping and fighting and flying quickly all around the boat.  That hadn't happened on other boat trips.  After stopping the video, more birds tried landing on the metal railings on the boat and flew back quickly, seemingly unable or unwilling to land.  Others were able to land on the canvas cover on the back of the boat, but fought for the area. The birds were not unique...  Their behavior was. That's when we descended back into the cabin to discuss the possibilities and try to explain the strange night.  We ruled out cars passing on a shore road, ruled out other boats, and ruled out someone getting on the boat.  We even wondered if a car had fallen into the bay. There was no evidence of anything of the sort.  Nothing explained the sudden rocking, the still water, the bright light filling the cabin, and the strange light in the sky. The fact remained that we were alone on the water in a deserted bay, so that's when I decided to call the local police and start asking questions to hopefully explain what happened.  So far there has been no logical explanation of the events from that night. We will send photos of the bay that were taken in the evening, just a few hours prior to the event.  The images show the surrounding hills and the smooth water of the quiet bay. ((END ADDENDUM, PREPARED BY WIFE));47.7173427152318;-116.782926821192
Quiet night on the boat disrupted by shaking and bright lights (wife's perspective);2016-05-06 22:26:00;1 minute;Quiet night on the boat disrupted by shaking and bright lights (wife's perspective) My husband and I moored our sailboat at a buoy in Beauty Bay in north-east Lake Coeur d'Alene, ID, on May 6th, 2016.  I awoke to a bright light coming in through the spaces around the cabin door (roof of the cabin) at 10:30 at night.  At first, I thought someone had boarded our boat because it went from perfectly still to rocking intensely from side to side.  This rocking only lasted about 5-10 seconds before it was still again. My husband was also awakened by this and, while he didn't see the light coming from the door, he saw it outside the window.  I urged him to investigate and when he went up, hesitantly, he said he saw a bright light coming from the sky searching the area. When I asked him what was out there, he told me that there weren't any boats approaching or leaving the bay and that there were still no other boats in this tiny bay. He said all he could see was a helicopter searching the area.  I thought this was bizarre since neither of us heard any noise as one might expect from a helicopter or airplane.  When I asked him if it was shaped like a helicopter, he said all he could see was the light, not the body of the aircraft.  He also said that the one bright light was moving in circles searching the area (not the aircraft, just the spotlight). I called the Coeur d' Alene police department and asked if there were helicopters in the area.  The lady I spoke to looked and said that there weren't any police or medical helicopters in the area, but there was one medical helicopter at the south end of the lake.  She also said that, being a medical emergency, even if it had gone through our area, which was unlikely, it wouldn't have hovered or searched with a light.  She then contacted the Spokane police department to see if they had come into Kootenai County and they said their helicopters were in Medical Lake, WA, at that time last night. I'm logical and skeptical and search for scientific explanations.  I am 35 years old and healthy and have never done drugs in my life.  I have a Masters degree and work in the field of education.
