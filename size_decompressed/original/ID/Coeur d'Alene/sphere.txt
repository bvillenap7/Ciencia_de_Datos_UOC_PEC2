Two Large Orange Sphere's on Canfield Mtn;2015-05-22 22:00:00;3-4 minutes;Two Large Orange Sphere's on Canfield Mtn My older son and I were driving home after a late dinner in Hayden.  Hovering over Canfield Mtn, was a fairly large orange orb.  We saw a second large orange orb about halfway up Canfield Mtn on the western side facing Dalton Gardens/Canfield Middle School. In the neighborhood just south of Canfield Middle school, there was a group of boys in their driveway watching it too. The orange orb on the mountain began to rise, I could then see multicolored lights on both Objects as they rose and disppeared. They were vey close, especially the one on the mountain, 500-800 ft away, maybe closer.;47.7173427152318;-116.782926821192
