The other one seemed to fall out of the first kind-of like a meteor. It was red like a fireball, and moved very fast. The triangle shaped one moved slowly and was at least 30 yard across maybe more. I got scared cause I was out side at the time, a firlfriend of mine called me and said it was coming up my direction, so i went out side to see if I could see it. Then all the sudden it was right above me,a curled up inito a little ball, because i was scared to death. It moved of after a short time. the other people that were there that night had left very suddenly, and left myself out side by myself for the rest of the night.  I can only say it was 35 minutes long because that's how long it seemed to be. when i went out side to look at what ever it was, it was about 10:30-11:00pm, when I went back in the house it was 4:22am.  I don't no what to make of that. My husband said that's called missing time, but I don't remmber any thing happening. I do know it was cold out side, but i went in side and felt as if i had been in side the whole time. I wasn't cold at all. Does that mean anything?  If so please let me know. That night has been with me for awhile now. I keep having , well dreams I guess of things that I did not see that night, but my girlfriend and I both have the same dreams alot. I thought that I might have seen this object once before, but it was all glowing red, like it was on fire, this time it was all black with no lights at all, other than the one that came out of it!;47.7173427152318;-116.782926821192
Orange triangle lights seen spinning slowly across the sky.;2012-07-06 10:45:00;5-8 minutes;Orange triangle lights seen spinning slowly across the sky. I observed a triangle-prism shaped ship. It was miraculously spinning vertically like it was tumbling in the sky slowly.  The lights were a dim orange, 3 on one side, and two on the top.  It slowly spun out of the horizon.;47.7173427152318;-116.782926821192
