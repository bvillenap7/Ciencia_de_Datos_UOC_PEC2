Is this a enormous star or a planet?;2011-01-08 03:00:00;every morning;Is this a enormous star or a planet? I do not smoke in my home so I go out to my porch.  EVERY morning between 2-4am I see this enourmous light or star in the same place.  It is too large to be a star. There are some mornings there are no other stars out because of the overcast, yet this light is clear to anyone who would look upon it.  The first morning I noticed this strange light I ran into the house and woke my husband. He came out and observed it also for a good 30 mins.  We used his binoculars and noticed a blue ringed light around the entire center light that was the color of a star.  It is there every morning when I step out to have a cigarette.  I would like to believe we are not alone.  This light will stay lit up even as the morning light comes..very strange.  It can be sited to the left of the moon every single morning.;42.9573;-115.3115
