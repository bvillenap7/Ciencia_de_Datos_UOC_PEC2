Red light flashing under battle tank hovering.;2014-04-15 20:30:00;2 minutes;Red light flashing under battle tank hovering. I was east bound I-84 about 830pm driving a set of triples.   I was on a section called China Wall, along Snake River, when I notice a flashing red light to my right across the river on top of the hill on other side.   At first I thought it was helicopter with shipping container under it, then I thought to big, maybe a wind tower, because it was so still large flashing red light underneath, then dawned on me ufo built like I heard on coast to coast a battle tank.;42.9573;-115.3115
