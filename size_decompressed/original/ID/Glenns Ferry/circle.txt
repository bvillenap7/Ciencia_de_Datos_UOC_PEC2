Truck driver observes 3 bright lights;2021-03-28 21:30:00;10 seconds;Truck driver observes 3 bright lights I am a truck driver and was driving east on 84, between Boise and Twin falls. It was very cloudy that night and no stars or satellites could be seen. All of the sudden, a bright white object appeared just below the thick cloud cover, it was as bright as a flare but not moving. Than 3 seconds later, 2 more lights came from the first light. All 3 were there for maybe 10 seconds, than the 2 other lights merged back with the first and just vanished. I did not capture this on video but there is a new video of a sighting last night that happened over the Montreal airport that was the exact same thing as I saw. I can email that video for reference if wanted. There were other cars on the roadway that may have also observed this. I drive every night and have never seen something like this in the sky before.;42.9573;-115.3115
