I witnessed a series of about 8 bright, orange-red globes or balls emerge from a dark hillside in about a 30 second-60 second succession.  It was around 20:00, dark clear sky with a few low cloud formations. Coming off of the dark hillside, the globes all had the same pattern of ascending to approximately the same elevation, then moving in a southerly direction until they were no longer visible. They moved smoothly like an airplane.  The last ball gained a higher elevation than the others before it moved south.  The objects appeared to be the same size. I have several pictures taken on my digital camera.  I was talking to a friend on the phone when I first noticed the first bright light on the dark hillside.  I watched at least 4 or more balls, describing them to my friend trying to figure out what these lights could be.  My friend suggested I try taking pictures.  I am not sure if there were more balls before the first one I saw.;48.6049;-116.3196
