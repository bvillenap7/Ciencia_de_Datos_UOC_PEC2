Saw 4 objects flying in an epsilon pattern.;2019-11-21 22:55:00;5-10 seconds;Saw 4 objects flying in an epsilon pattern. I was letting my dog go to the bathroom and looked up in the sky and for about 5 seconds I saw 4  circular objects move across the sky at a rapid rate. The objects almost seemed see through but were very slightly illuminated. It almost looked like when a huge light is shined in the sky and you can see it from far away  but it wasn't nearly as bright. There were 4 objects and they flew in an epsilon pattern like a half v and we're almost perfectly spaced but at one point it looked like the last object broke formation slightly. When I first spotted them they were almost directly above my head and seemed like they were about the height that I always see crop dusters fly, although they could have been higher. In the 5 seconds I watched them fly completely out of view. They were moving alot faster than any plane I have ever noticed it was almost too fast to track them with my eyes. I am positive it wasn't any kind of plane and I'm sure it wasn't any kind of light! that you sometimes see shine through the sky. There was very little cloud cover tonight. The objects were very different and almost seemed like they were distorting the image of the sky around them. I have never seen anything close to as wierd as this in my life and thought I would report it.;43.8125457142857;-111.785445714286
