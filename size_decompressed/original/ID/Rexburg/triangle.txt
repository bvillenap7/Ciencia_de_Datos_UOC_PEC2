Triangle-shaped object with lights emitting in each corner of the object flies overhead.;2016-09-28 21:00:00;2 seconds;Triangle shaped object with lights emitting in each corner of the object flies overhead. I was in the observatory of BYUI when I was looking up at the sky and I saw a triangle shaped object, that appeared to be evenly sided, shoot across my scope of vision and over my head.  It was close enough for me to see the out line of the triangle shaped object and to make it seem that it was moving fast overhead.  The triangle shaped object had some type of white light emitting from each corner, as if there was a bulb or fuel ejection system on it.  If it wasn't for those lights, I believe that the object would of blended in with the night sky and I doubt that I would of been able to make out the shape if it wasn't for the light emitting from the bottom side of the triangle.;43.8125457142857;-111.785445714286
