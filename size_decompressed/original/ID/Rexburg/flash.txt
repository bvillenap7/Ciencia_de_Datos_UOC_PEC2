My family and I witness bright blue flashes lighting up the night sky.;2013-12-23 18:45:00;1 hour;My family and I witness bright blue flashes lighting up the night sky. My family and I saw about a dozen flashes of blue lighting up the entire night sky in our front and back yard over the time of one hour.  We never caught it fast enough to see the source of the light, but it was bright enough to essentially light up the entire sky around my house.   The weather forecast does not call for lightning today, which rules that out as being a possibility.;43.8125457142857;-111.785445714286
Blue, red and green flashes seen above east Idaho.;2013-12-23 19:30:00;5 minutes;Blue, red and green flashes seen above east idaho I was driving home from Rexburg to Rigby headed south on Highway 20.  I was just driving along when suddenly to the left or east of me above the Rexburg water tower there was a large blue flash that was brighter than any lighting Ive ever seen.  The chistmas lights and all other light for that matter went out for five seconds then turned back on.   About a minute later about 10 miles south of the first one there was a second one about the same brightness and same color then even further south there was a red flash followed by a green one about 10 seconds apart.  After that I was driving and I thought I may have seen more but was trying to drive.;43.8125457142857;-111.785445714286
