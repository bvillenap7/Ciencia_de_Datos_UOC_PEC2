On August 12th, 2015, my wife, her cousin, and I were outside observing the Perseid meteor shower.  When my wife noticed a bright yellow light moving towards our general location. The light seemed to stop and then went straight up until we lost sight of it.   We had clear skies so it didn't disappear behind clouds. It seemed like it was exiting our atmosphere and it was strange because it made a 90 degree angle.  There were no blinking lights to identify it as a satellite or plane.  We only seen it for about 30 seconds or so.  The size of the light would be like looking at a quarter from 10 feet away.;43.6707;-111.897
