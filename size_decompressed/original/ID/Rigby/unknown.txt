These lights were spinning trying to do something, what that something is is unknown.  There were also many crafts seen in the sky. They were also landing by the snake river.  We have been seeing this almost every night for the past 10 days.  The ones that landed were about a quarter mile away from us and the ones in the sky were high up and close to the ground. I have footage of this also.;43.6707;-111.897
