All witnesses are members of the same family) At approximately 17:30 hours a 31 year old woman was driving with 4 of her minor children when she noticed a long 'cigar' shaped string of lights to the northwest of Kamiah Idaho. (Kamiah is north central Idaho)  She was on highway 12 at milepost 70.  The lights were described as 9 lights in a row and appeared to be three to a section, with one bright white light on each end, with a smaller red light in each center.  The area is mountainous and the object appeared to be approximately 1/4 mile away, and 300 feet in length, and was traveling in a downward direction.  It is possible that the 'string of lights' landed in a clearing on the hillside.  No sound was heard.   At approximately 19:30 hours two boys 16 and 17 were at the Kamaih High School football field and noticed the same string of  lights travel slowly over the field at approximately 300 feet altitude traveling from east to west.  (This sighting was 4 3/4 miles east of the first sighting)   At 20:30 hours approximately 1/2 mile from the football field, a lady indoors heard a loud noise similiar to several jets flying over and went to investigate.  She saw 9 lights, but observed  3 distinct V shaped craft at an altitude of 3 to 400 feet.  All three craft were travelling from east to west. (Investigators note: Witnesses are attempting to find landing traces on the hillside. If some are reported, investigator will go to the area, and begin a sampling program.)
