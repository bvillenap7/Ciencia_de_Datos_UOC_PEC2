Object coming out of the sky;2004-07-12 00:00:00;3 minutes;Object coming out of the sky I was looking up at the stars, through the window of my cabin, and I saw this really bright one.  As I kept watching it, it got bigger, and then I started seeing little red lights flashing as it got closer.  The lights outlined it and formed a saucer shape, and it flew over my cabin and out of my view.  There was only one, and it didn't just fly over like a plane would, because it came right out of the sky.  The window was open and there wasn't a sound coming from the UFO like there would be from a plane or other human craft. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));44.4451;-111.3683
