Saw strange light going in circles, then it shot up to space.;2011-01-15 01:30:00;20 minutes;Saw strange light going in circles, then it shot up to space. I was standing outside having a cigarette and I saw a light out of the corner of my eye, I looked over and watched the light lose altitude and become even with the horizon.  It started moving North and going in circles.   After about 15-20 minutes of watching this thing go in circles and slowly move over the horizon, it took off straight up and I lost sight of it.  I heard no sound at all.  I would guess the object was 1/4-1/2 mile from me. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));42.9474;-114.382
