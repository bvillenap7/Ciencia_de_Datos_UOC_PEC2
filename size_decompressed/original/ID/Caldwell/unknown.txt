I am surprised that no one in this organization has used the URANTIA book for reference. Paper 28, 29 and 30 would help to explain a lot about visitors to our planet.;43.6384676767677;-116.728031313131

2 objects almost looked like playing in the dark sky this morning.  Moving at times so fast it made my eyes blur.  ((anonymous report));2019-04-29 05:20:00;>30 minutes;2 objects almost looked like playing in the dark sky this morning.  Moving at times so fast it made my eyes blur This morning, April 29, 2019, in Caldwell, Idaho, I was sitting outside, waiting for the pugs to take care of business.  It was about 5:15-5:20am.  I looked up in the sky and over to the south, I see 2 moving objects.  I don't mean moving as in flying by.  They were moving back and forth, side to side, up and down.  It looked like they were playing.  I called my husband to come see this.  He watched for a few moments and said he had no idea, but he had never seen anything move like these objects move.  They darted around one would move right then the other, sometimes they would be really close to each other and then one would move to the right so fast it made my eyes blur.  I tried to get video and pictures, but it was so dark they didn't come out very well.  I will say that the short video I tried to get of these 2 moving things did not show them, but showed two small flashing lights hovering all around them.  I did not see these two small lights as I watched the objects move back and forth.  I saw the lights only when I videoed the objects.  The sun was starting to come up by 6am and they were still the the same area, still moving around but staying pretty much together.  I left for work and looked for them in the sky but they were not there.  I would have loved to see how they left.

The objects looked like satellites in the sky and how they were moving it looked like it was not in out atmosphere yet. As soon as I saw it my hairs on my body jumped up and each one faded like a light going out in a cascading order in or about the same spot.;43.6384676767677;-116.728031313131
