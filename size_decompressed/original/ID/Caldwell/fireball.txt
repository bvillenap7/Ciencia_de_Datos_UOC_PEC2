Orange/red, low flying spherical craft seen 200 yards away from 10th ave S. and Castle Way.;2012-07-05 01:00:00;2-3 minutes;Orange/red, low flying spherical craft seen 200 yards away from 10th ave S. and Castle Way. 12:00AM-While entering my subdivision I  observed in the sky a low flying spherical fireball looking craft(roughly the size of a one man helicopter) no more than 200 yards away moving south toward a nearby lake.  My friend turned the vehicle around and it back on the main road.  I quickly exited the vehicle to get a better look and the craft performed a strange maneuver as it rapidly reversed directions (without turning around) then shot straight up and continued south toward Lake Lowell where I lost sight of it after about 30 seconds.
