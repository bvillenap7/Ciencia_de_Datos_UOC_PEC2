9 orange lights hovering Northwest of Caldwell;2013-12-24 19:00:00;10 minutes;9 orange lights hovering Northwest of Caldwell 9 orange lights in sky Northwest of Caldwell,ID.  Looked like bright stars but began to move around in sky.  Three grouped together making triangle.  The rest were hovering lower.   We watched these orange lights make strange movements for about 10 mins but had an appointment to be at.   When we got home 3 hrs later they were gone.  We were thinking they might have been the new military drones but we're not sure.  Did anyone else see this?;43.6384676767677;-116.728031313131
Caldwell, ID, red orb-like lights high in the sky.;2015-01-24 19:15:00;10 minutes;Caldwell, ID, red orb-like lights high in the sky. Two large red lights were seen between 7:15-7:20 pm.  They were hovering in the sky, approx. helicopter flight height, larger than helicopters, bright red like a cell tower top light only larger.   They were all of a sudden present, then disappeared, reappeared and disappeared.  No audible sound was heard from either one.   One was almost straight above us.   They were approximately 1/4 mile apart north and south of each other.   There was an elementary school in between the two orb type red lights.  We have never seen anything like this.   In binoculars, appeared to be a dark center with fire type light on the outside.    We thought maybe it was a very large hot air balloon.  But disappeared twice.;43.6384676767677;-116.728031313131

It came up slowly, and continued into the atmosphere until the light was too dim to see.  I watch the stars nightly, see planes, helicopters, shooting stars.  Im able to recognize planets, stars, and constellations in our night sky.  This was most definitely not a man made light.  It was quite visibly something we have ever seen before.  This is the 3rd time ive witnessed unusual activity in our area of the sky.;43.6384676767677;-116.728031313131
