My wife asked if we might be able to see the shuttle with John Glen.At about that time I pointed out a very bright star,it seemed to come towards us getting brighter and larger. We started to become fearful because it was getting very large and quite large. We just watched in wonder when it stopped seemed to turn and quickly became the size of a star in the night sky again the zipped away the went out like the plug was pulled.

Saw a large light change colors and eventually dim to nothing on El Paso Rd.;2000-10-04 20:30:00;about 15 minutes;Saw a large light change colors and eventually dim to nothing on El Paso Rd. My husband, our house mate and I were all standing out on our front porch, looking at the stars when we noticed a really bright light crest the hill about a mile away. I asked what it was and my husband said it was probably someone spotlighting, perhaps looking for deer. Our housemate said Is there a road up there? Maybe it's a cop? It grew brighter and they went inside. Then it started to rise above the hill. AT this point, it was still just a bright white light. I yelled inside, you guys? It's rising and it's getting brighter. They were laughing at me and then came out to see. We all just watched it a minute and then it started to change colors. First red, then green, then blue. Then it went bright white again. They ran inside to find some binoculars and it was then it began to fad slowly. Almost like a candle going out when you cover the jar with something. Then it was just the size of all the other stars and then it was gone. This all took about 15 minutes. As for the backgrounds of the observers, I was raised Catholic and an army brat. Grew up mostly in Sierra Vista, AZ. JOined the Army where I met my husband. He grew up in Horseshoe Bend, ID. He was in the service for 8 years, myself for 4. He is a mechanic in Boise, ID. I stay home with our 2 kids. We have been married for 4 and a half years. Our housemate is a guy who works with my husband and needed a place to stay while going through a particularly nasty divorce.;43.6384676767677;-116.728031313131
Large very bright light seen flying west to east over Caldwell, Idaho.;2010-08-15 02:00:00;30 seconds;large very bright light seen flying west to east over Caldwell Idaho A friend and I were floating on intertubes in his pool late at night gazing up at the night sky and all of a sudden I see an extremely bright light flying west to east, it was large and so bright that I could not determine the exact shape of it, circular is my best guess. I don’t know how high up it was but it was certainly well below where an airplane would fly.  I compare the brightness of the object to the equivalent of at least 10 bright stars.  Biggest and brightest light I’ve ever seen in the sky. Anyway it flew over our location, we watched until we couldn’t see it anymore.  It seemed to have a definite course in mind and it wasn’t falling, it was flying.  There was no flame coming off of it and it was completely silent. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD));43.6384676767677;-116.728031313131

Orange lights over Caldwell, ID;2014-10-03 22:30:00;5 minutes;Orange lights over Caldwell, ID Distinctly saw 3 orange lights in the formation of a triangle in the sky that were so bright, they dimmed the stars around them.   The top light moved slowly down towards the other two, then blinked a few times and disappeared.  The two lower lights moved slowly up and closer together.  The one to the right side blinked and disappeared with the left one disappearing close behind it. Two of us witnessed this and watched for a good 5 minutes. They did not move in a way I have ever seen a plane or helicopter move.;43.6384676767677;-116.728031313131
4 orange lights appeared in sky south of Caldwell, ID.;2015-11-04 17:45:00;6 seconds;4 orange lights appeared in sky south of Caldwell, ID. I was headed down Farmway Road on the west end of Caldwell at approximately 5:45pm, the sun had set but the sky was still light.   At the south end of the valley, at or near the Owyhee Mountains, I saw a orange light up in the sky flash on, then about 2 seconds later, two more orange lights appeared to the left and right of the first light, and then all 3 disappeared.   About 6 seconds later, a 4th orange light flashed to the far right of where the first 3 lights had appeared, and then disappeared.;43.6384676767677;-116.728031313131
Looked like another star, but moved in jerky circles.;2018-08-12 23:00:00;>5 minutes;Looked like another star, but moved in jerky circles. A light that looked like any of the other stars in the sky moved erratically.  It went in uneven circles directly overhead.  Because of its jerky, erratic movements, I suspect it was a human-controlled drone, but why would it emit light like a star?;43.6384676767677;-116.728031313131
