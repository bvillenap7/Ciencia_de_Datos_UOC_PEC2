At approximately 7:00 pm, Mountain Standard Time, my brother, sister-in-law, husband and myself had stepped out on our back porch to chat a bit.  It was a clear night for viewing the stars.  My brother was looking to the north from our backyard and stated what is that?   We all then proceeded to look north and noticed one circlular shaped object moving very steady and slowly.  The object was engulfed in a steady white light.  We reasoned that it was approximately 5,000 feet high and approximately 5 to 10 miles away.  As we were observing the object we tried to reason that it was a traditional aircraft but my husband and brother (who had both served in the Airforce) knew it was not.  The light continued to glow steadily with no blinking at all.  Furthermore, it seemed to be gliding in a steady way, making no turns whatsoever.   We continued to watch this object fly from the west to the east (towards Boise, Idaho), for approximately 2 minutes and then it just disappeared.  It was there, and then it was not. It seemed to just fade out in front of our eyes.  Also, approximately 5-10 seconds later, after the object disappeared, we noticed an airplane with blinking lights headed in the direction we had last seen this craft.  Unlike the white glowing object, we knew the second craft was a tradional airplane as the lights were blinking.  Not sure exactly what this object was but we all believe that it was not a traditional airplane.  It was quite an experience to see this object.;43.6384676767677;-116.728031313131
