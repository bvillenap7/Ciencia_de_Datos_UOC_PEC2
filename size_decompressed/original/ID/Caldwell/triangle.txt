Copper Triangular UFO hovers over field then disappears in 1994;1994-07-15 15:30:00;5 minutes;Copper Triangular UFO hovers over field then disappears in 1994 I stepped outside to run around with the dog and I immediately saw a huge copper colored triangle shaped craft hovering over our field.  It was covering our field and part of the two fields nearby.  It was immense in side and made almost no noise.  I should preface that we had other weird UFO sightings in Caldwell but this is the only one where I actually saw something during the day.  I don't know why but both me and my dog ran towards it.  I have a fear of UFOs so this is very bizarre.   When I reached the fence and was under it, in a blink it was completely gone and an almost instant feeling of terror came over me and I ran back to the house and told my brothers.  I told my mother and she told me never to tell anyone because they wouldn't believe me but that she too had seen UFOs in Caldwell.   There were no lights that I saw or windows or any sort.  It was smooth and looked like brushed copper in color. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));43.6384676767677;-116.728031313131

I wasstaring at the stars and out of nowhere this triangular, translucent, object appears, gliding slowly through the sky.  On its three corners were circle lights that were the color of the stars.  I immediately.  Tell the wife to make sure I'm not seeing things and she verifies.  We then lose it for a good minute and then it reappears, only now it's hovering and blinking red and blue orange light.  A short time after it s  still blinking but releases what looks like a bunch of red lights ( atleast 10) and only a single one that flys away from triangular shape and down, then fades out. Ive never seen anything like that before.  It was pretty fascinating!;43.6384676767677;-116.728031313131
UFO CLOUD 2400MPH  ((anonymous report));2017-08-21 11:27:00;-1 second;UFO CLOUD 2400MPH I set up an IPHONE 6 on a picnic table setting camera to time lapse mode facing east as eclipse had already started got video of before and after shadow came over us.   After that happened I sent the video to my friend who has cancer to show him what the eclipse looked like here, moments later he sent me back a screen shot of something in the sky in my video and he asked me is that an UFO joking about it.   So I went to my time lapse video and looked it over and found that some object is in the video that had flown over us so fast we did not see or hear it and you can see it was going the same speed as the eclipse shadow speed was also going.  The video shows that the camera was lucky to catch the UFO on time lapse that split second.  When I froze the frame, it looks like a cloud in the shape of an arrow when I zoomed in, there is like vapor all around something dark in the middle of the vapor.   I have posted to YOU TUBE under UFO cloud during eclipse in western Idaho.  Give it a look please.  I know the speed of the eclipse shadow was 2400 mph the same for the UFO.
