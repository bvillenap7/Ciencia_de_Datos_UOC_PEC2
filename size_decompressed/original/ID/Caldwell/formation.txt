Orange orbs traveling over Marsing, below inversion layer;2014-01-24 20:04:00;3 minutes;Orange orbs traveling over Marsing, below inversion layer 8:02pm southwest sky, traveling slowly northeast.  I arrived at home, got out of my car, and observed these orange colored lights.  At first I thought it was a constellation, but the lights shined brighter than any star.  Also at this time we were in an inversion, so we hadn't seen the moon, stars or sun for well over a week.  My next thought was maybe helicopter formation.  Well with a cloud ceiling of maybe 1000 ft., I should have been able to hear them, nor did they have any flashing beacons.   I hurried to the door, and called for my wife as a witness.  When she came out there were maybe eight lights remaining.  They took about three seconds apiece to fade with about five seconds inbetween as they all slowly disappeared.  It reminded us of a similar incident we witnessed from home on July 3 2013.  Four lights in a diamond pattern due north at  about 10:30.  They appeared stationary then slowly faded as I mentioned above.;43.6384676767677;-116.728031313131
Formation over Caldwell, Idaho.;2016-11-17 20:00:00;10 minutes;Formation over Caldwell Idaho About 8pm, me and my wife saw what looked like rose-orange colored lights in sky over our apartment that moved in formation.  It started as a perfect triangle of 3 then a 4th entered the formation and made an arrow like formation in the sky.  The end light  seemed to dim out and fade away.   There was no sound and obviously there was intelligent formation of the lights that seemed to be just above us not too far into the horizon.;43.6384676767677;-116.728031313131
