Cigar shaped UFO over Caldwell, ID.;2014-12-16 17:30:00;10 minutes;Cigar shaped UFO over Caldwell, ID I was stopped at a red light when I saw a dark shape in the clouds. At first glance I thought it was a group of birds flying together, but as it came closer, I noticed it was a cigar shaped oval.  It was black, or appeared black because it looked as though it was behind the clouds. It was weaving back and forth at an alarmingly fast rate.  It almost looked like it was turning, but I couldn't tell if it was turning away from me, side to side, or all the way around. There was a big light on the under side of it.  As the light changed to green, I quickly pulled over, but by the time I got out of my car, I couldn't see it anymore. Other people were looking and pointing up at the sky, but I didn't stop to talk to them. I was the only witness that I'm aware of. I'm not a believer.  I'm a full-time straight-A Veterinary Technician student and a very logical, rational thinker. But what I saw cannot be explained.;43.6384676767677;-116.728031313131
