A cigar shaped object was hovering in place (no movement) for 20 mins.  We zoomed in with a camera and the object appeared to be enveloped in orange flames but at the right hand tip we saw a metallic  undercarriage.   The object was far away so it appeared to be of an enormous size (maybe the size of a large cargo ship.)  This resembled a comet trail but there was no movement.   Also, the sky was clear blue, no wind, and great visibility.;44.8885;-116.0742
