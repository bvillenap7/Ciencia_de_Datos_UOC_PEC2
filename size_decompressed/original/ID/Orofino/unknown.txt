We suspect the Aurora Borrealis may have been the cause.  We provide below an offical NASA report from a popular website, dedicated to the subject of space weather.  We find it interesting that the aurora was reported as being distinctly red.  The ones we have witnessed, and the ones reported to us traditionally are blue, green, or some light pastel color in the blue-green portion of the visible spectrum.
