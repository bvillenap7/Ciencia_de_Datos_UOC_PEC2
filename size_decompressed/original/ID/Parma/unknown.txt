Bright Flash- Pregnant wife getting up off of ground, 30 feet away.;1980-06-26 19:00:00;00:01;Bright Flash- Pregnant wife getting up off of ground, 30 feet away. In the latter part of June 1980, my wife, 9 months pregnant, myself, and two other couples took a ride to a local hilltop to watch lightning storms over the Owyhee mountains approximately 100 to 150 miles to the south of us. Seven o'clock in the evening during June the sun is still quite high in the sky, but due to the thunder storms it was light, but not bright sunlight. Above us was clear blue sky for miles, so I discount the chance of any lightning strike any where near us. We were all sitting on a picnic table when all of a sudden we experienced a bright flash of light. All except my wife saw different colors, myself saw red, the brightest red I've ever seen. The others saw blue and red. My wife remembers seeing bright white light. Thats all any of us can recall, except my wife, which was sitting right next to me, was getting up off the ground about 30 feet away to my right (west) of our position. We were all extremely bewildered at what had just happend. It all happened in a split second. We looked around for possible scorching on the ground in case of lightning, there was nothing. We left the area immediately. Later that evening we all experienced a painful neck. My wife had severe pain in her pelvic area, hips and lower back. My wife went on to carry our first born for 10 months with no problems during delivery. The baby was dehyderated but was healthy. She is currently a sophmore in college. We have two other kids, The second, a boy is extremely bright straight A's all his life (a sophmore in high school). His TAP test scores are in the 99% of the nation. The third, a girl, is a bright girl and a gifted athlete. She is currently a sixth grader. All of these kids were born less than a month of being exactly 4 yrs. apart.;43.7914;-116.936
