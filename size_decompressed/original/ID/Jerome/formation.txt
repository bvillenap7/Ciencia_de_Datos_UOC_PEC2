I then noticed 3 more amber lights in a straight line to the left of the first light.  The lights were all the same color and none of them moved.  The lights were much brighter than any other lights in the surrounding towns.  About 1 min. after I first spotted them the lights went out in order from right to left.  I didn't think much about it at the time but was watching a UFO special on the sci.-fi. channel the night of 2/14/01 and saw the same lights.  But on the TV the lights were in reverse order. I wonder if anyone else saw the same thing.;42.7237;-114.514
