I now observed another bright object come into view moving in the same direction as the first but at a lower altitude.  When the second object got close to the first object, it started moving again, but changed its heading to the northeast.  The second object followed on the same course. I watched the two bright amber lights travel northeast until they became so dim I lost sight of them.  There was no sound associated with either objects. At the time the cloud ceiling was 4800 AGL(Above Ground Level),we are at 4047 MSL(Mean Sea Level) there was plus ten miles visibility, no moon, no stars.  I am a commercial pilot/flight instructor with 10,000 plus hours of flight time and I have never seen anti collision lights that bright and amber on any airships in all the time I've been aware of the night sky's along with airplanes flying at night.;42.7237;-114.514

Coworker #1's account of the sighting: At 6AM coworker rushed into building from out side to inform me of strange lights in the sky.  We then witnessed the lights traveling from west to east perfectly spaced at about 15 second intervals.  The event lasted several minutes I tried to record it but they were a bit out of range for my phone (I saved the video just incase).  The lights were moving at a high speed but perfectly silent.  I spent 8yrs in the Marine Corps Air Wing and have never witnessed anything like it.  I would like to add that I've always been a skeptic of UFO claims but this really has me shook.;42.7237;-114.514
