I observed what I thought was a satellite just under the moon moving North by Northeast.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-05-03 21:00:00;15 minutes;I was looking up at the night sky when I observed what I thought was a satellite just under the moon moving North by Northeast.  Then I observed a line of thirteen lights moving at the same speed, separated by the exact same distance between each moving light.  I believe the light was the reflection of the sun off the moving objects and that they were in space and not in our atmosphere.  There was no sound of jet engines and the thirteen crafts continued on until out of my eye sight.  I am a commercial pilot, CFII with over 10K hrs of logged flight.;42.7237;-114.514
