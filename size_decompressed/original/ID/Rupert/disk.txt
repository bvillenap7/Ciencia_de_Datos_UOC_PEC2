Watched it with binoculars for about 10 minutes. When first saw light in NW it was bright orange, turning yellow and then white when approaching overhead. Told friend a few weeks later and she and her husband saw it later but it was bright orange and not moving about five miles from out home. My husband is a college graduate and both the other observers are college graduates.;42.6888;-113.6481
