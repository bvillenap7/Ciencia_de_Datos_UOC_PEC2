Star brightend in shy, then slowly faded away to invisible;1999-07-09 23:00:00;10 seconds;Star brightend in shy, then slowly faded away to invisible Was looking at SW sky approx 15 degrees off horison, just over top of Mtn range in distance.  Noticed an airplane traveling west over lake. Turned to talk to someone in house and as I looked back I saw a new  very bright star in portion of sky I'd been looking at. It was brighter, whiter & larger than the brightest planet you'd expect to see in the sky.  As I began to tell the others inside to come look, it grew brighter for second, then over a period of about five seconds grew dimmer and smaller as if it was going out.  Or as if it was going directly away a a high rate of speed.  I do not know.  It went out and in that part of the sky I could see other stars that were behind or beside  (?) it, but had trouble seeing in it's direct area (very small circle of the sky).  All this time the airplane I had seen earlier was traveling across the same aprox line of sight. I do not know what it was.  My first thought was a SuperNova which I'm told is a extreme brightening of a star followed by it's dimming and going out.  (I'm telling this only to aid in my description, not teach you what a SuperNova is!!) I am college educated, professional, sane , sober, drug free, 43 YO male and believe Im rational.;44.6927;-115.6417

Points of light moving erratically in the sky, sometimes at great speed.;2020-11-05 20:15:00;40 minutes;Points of light moving erratically in the sky, sometimes at great speed. On 11/5/20, about 8:15pm I stepped outside to let my dog out. When I looked up, I saw an unusual bright light in the southern sky. As I watched it, it suddenly changed direction and then moved erratically, both east and west. It was slightly red around the edge, but shape was not observable. I called for my wife to come see, and she was amazed to see it moving around in the sky, sometimes at great speed. She called her sister who lives close by. Within 10 minutes, her sister sent a text to say that she and her husband had seen three of these lights in the sky. I went back out and observed a second light moving in precise unison with the first one. They were much more overhead and the original one seemed much brighter than the second one. They continued to move around in the sky without any apparent direction for thirty minutes before I lost sight of them. This is my second time in the last 2 weeks of spotting this phenomena. The first episode was very similar, but only a single light was observed, and I was the only witness.;44.6927;-115.6417
