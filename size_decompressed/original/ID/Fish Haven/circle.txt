Really clear night.  No nearby light pollution from cabins or anything since we were about 300 yards out into the lake. Super clear night.  Was beautiful stars. Me and one other both noticed a light fly by at the same time.  Way up in the sky.  Definitely outside of the atmosphere to eliminate the possibility of it being a plane, drone, etc. It also changed direction and speeds at random.  It would fly one direction for 1-2 seconds then stop.  Then change directions and fly a few more seconds.  Then stop. Sometimes the lights would pulse, sometimes they were off.  Sometimes it would change direction while the light was off then it would appear off to the side. The speed and quickness it would change directions (not fly only straight) eliminated any possibility of it being identifiable. It was too high up to see any detailed characteristics.  Couldn't really tell the shape or size.  But 100% was flying, had lights, was fast, and would fly in different directions.;42.0459;-111.4633
