Bright orange light in the sky over the Wood River Valley, Hailey Idaho;2013-09-18 22:30:00;1.5 minutes;Bright orange light in the sky over the Wood River Valley, Hailey Idaho First of all I love to look at the sky so it wasn’t unusual for me to look into the sky as I was heading to bed.  I saw in the sky a bright orange light, about the size of two stars combined moving slowly to the south/east.  I went to grab a phone/camera and I was in the middle of the Apple IOS upgrade (the first day available) and then went to grab my thirteen year old daughters iphone and I did not have the pass code to open the phone.  Anyhow I went to my front door on the north and east side of the house to watch and it slowed and went to the west slightly and went blank.  Poof it was gone.  Wow that was cool I said to myself and I’m sure lots of people must have seen it.  But I haven’t found any info in my local area so thought I would add it to this site.;43.6692;-114.4858
