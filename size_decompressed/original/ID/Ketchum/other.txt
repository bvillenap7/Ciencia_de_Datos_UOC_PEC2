We noticed the object was not moving. We observed an airplane going overhead slightly to the north of the object, but definitely thousands of feet lower in the atmosphere. The object was in the North East sky and witnessed by five people.  We captured these photographs after looking through binoculars and realizing there was something “black” at the top of the white dot.;43.6692;-114.4858
