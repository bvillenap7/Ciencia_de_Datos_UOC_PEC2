I went out side to smoke Me and my girl friend and are kids have been seen these lights before back In February and January they are orange in color they light up for several seconds then go out I use a spoting scope to look at them you can also see them with the naked eye but after they go out they look like a very small stars and they go back and forth and up and down in all kinds of derections but never in circular derections it's always up and down side to side and in all kinds of angles they will light up and go out sometimes next to one another or what looks like several feet apart tonight I seen them light up about 8 to 10 different times they are always just above the herizon and tonight there was one that was mulity colors for just a few seconds I also got one on video can't see it to well but then the darn thing went dead and usually when we see them they will apear for 2 to 5 nights in a row so I will try and get more video footage of them what I'm seeing I don't believe to be are craft of any sort when I look at them in my spotting scope all I can make out is its an orange lite when they light up and after they go out they look like a small white star moving back and forth or they will sit still while other ones are moving around them it's the craziest stuff I've ever seen would really like to know what I'm or we're seeing I've went as far as calling the cops to see if anyone else is seeing these lites I've call the air force base in mountain home Idaho and asked them if they are doing texting or stuff out this way but they say no there has been lots of reports all over Idaho of people seeing the same lights so ya i would really really like to know what I'm seeing it's been 3 months sence we've seen them but Me and my girl friend have also been seeing a different light the last week are so this one has what in my spotting scope looks like a green body and a light that flashes red all around then green I've seen this one at around 10:00 to 10:30 pm and 1:00 to 1:30 am 3 differ! ent time s in they same area in the past week our so anyway I could go on and on and on bout these things but it would be way easier to explain on the phone than txt Couse I'm not the greatest and putting stuff into words so there it be if I get better video footage I will try and post it Couse there is something crazy going on in the night sky's around where I live :);42.6036;-114.7862
Orange orbs in sky above Buhl, Idaho.;2014-09-03 22:30:00;5 minutes;Orange orbs in sky above Buhl. We were driving down the highway towards Buhl, when we saw a giant orange orb.   One by one, more orbs lit up until there was 5 in a row.   They all went black at the same time.  The craft shot east and one orb lit up again.  It went black and disappeared.
