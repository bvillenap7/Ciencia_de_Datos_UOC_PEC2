And I must say we have seen alot of strange unexplaned things in the sky.   On this night I saw these things move way more than what would be considerd normal!  Every night I see several satelite type objects that move about in very radical directional changes, and I am very curious as to what they might be?  Please contact me;42.6036;-114.7862
