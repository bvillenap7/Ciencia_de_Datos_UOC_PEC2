I'm a truck driver.I was driving on Hwy 30 just entering the town of Lava Hot Springs at precisely 2:15 am. travelling west towards Interstate 15 just south of Pocatello, Idaho. There was light rain, no moon it was a dark night.  I observed just west and south of me, at what appeared to be at high altitude, a string of about 30 amber lights in a perfect straight line.  I temporarily lost sight of these as I negotiated the winding road.  When I next saw them they now appeared to be decending at a steep angle and had now broken the formation.It now looked like a comet with a tail which was both curved and V shaped.  It was still composed of individual amber lights. It looked as if it would crash.  Again I lost sight of it for a moment.  When next I saw it, it had again changed shape.It now looked like a double V one behind the other.  I must emphasize that I accually did not see motion.  These were, so to speak, snapshots as my attention had to be redirected to driving on this wet mountain road.  But the position of these objects was changing as was my own.  When I last observed these objects, they were now still south of me but behind me.  Their shape now appeared to be a single V, only now one arm of the V was longer than the other.  Total time elapsed 2-3 minutes.;42.6225;-112.0185
