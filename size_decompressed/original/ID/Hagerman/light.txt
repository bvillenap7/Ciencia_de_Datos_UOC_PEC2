As I was driving back from Twin Falls Idaho on Tupper Grade heading West I saw three very bright stars just above the hills forming a curved line pointing to the right.  About 2 minutes later I look back up and two of those stars are missing and then they reappeared but were floating in the air disappearing and reappearing. five minutes from when I first noticed them I arrived at home and looked back at them and then two disappeared and seconds later I heard two very loud booms and a gust of wind on a non windy day.  The third one that never changed in any way disappeared five minutes after the others.;42.8156;-114.8856

Twinkled really brightly in the dark, hovered in the same spot, I pulled out my pocket universe to try to figure out if it was a planet and got nothing.  Thought it could be Venus, but I went inside, texted my friend about it, went back outside and it was gone.  I've never seen anything besides the moon so bright in the sky.;42.8156;-114.8856
