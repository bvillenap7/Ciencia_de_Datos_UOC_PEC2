A second sighting in a small rural Idaho town.;2010-07-12 22:00:00;2+ hours;A second sighting in a small rural Idaho town. I went out a sunset to see if I could see this again as I reported a sighting on July 8th.  I could see it immediately.  I took 200 pictures over the next 2 hours of it.  It sometimes looks like a sphere or circle and other times more of a hexagon.  On manual focus I could see it pulsating and it looks as if something in jumping around inside it.  It is colorful but so bright that it looks white.  I was able to see it's movement by extending the shutter speed.  Each time it formed a different unique pattern in the sky.  It seemed to get closer and farther away.  My niece was with me this time and she saw it too.  It frightened her.  I felt no fear at all. I would love to send my pictures to someone to be analyzed or compared with others who have seen this.  I have never had an encounter before July 8th.;44.5957;-116.6735
