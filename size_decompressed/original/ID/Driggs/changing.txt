Extremely bright strange lights changing shape multiple times;2020-02-12 18:30:00;30 minutes;Extremely bright strange lights changing shape multiple times We followed these lights for about 30 minutes and 40 miles while driving into Driggs and up to the school.  It started as 3 lights in a triangle shape, but changed shape many times in lines, pyramids, squares, right angles, and many different triangular shapes. The lights were far brighter than any other light in the sky and much higher. They flickered in and out and gave off bright beams of light on the sides. At one point one of the smaller lights repeatedly moved into a larger one and then moved away. While in a parking lot we witnessed them in a pyramid and then move into a “V” shape in a matter of seconds. We also saw one light appear out of thin air and move around with the others. When we returned about two hours later the lights were gone. We caught the lights on video a few times but they couldn’t always be seen on the camera.;43.7273;-111.1253
