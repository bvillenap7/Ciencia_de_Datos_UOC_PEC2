I was in the military service  and spend many hours standing watch.   I never in my life saw anything move so fast in the sky.  I have seen rockets in the shy in my life time , but compared to the speed of this flashing star. 12:32 AM Mountain time.  it traveled West to East.  It was comparable to a star.I must say the mode of travel it was a craft.  I would like to know if a rocket was fired from VAF Base, Santa Maria, Calif at that time.  Many years ago , I worked there Construction. I must say this moved much faster. I had to report this.Description of the object one item the size of a star , but very bright flashing across the shy.;43.9601;-111.6975
