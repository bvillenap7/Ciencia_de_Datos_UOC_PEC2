3 alternating color, fast moving lights over Stanley Lake in Stanley, Idaho.;2011-06-25 01:00:00;20 minutes;3 alternating color, fast moving lights over Stanley Lake in Stanley, Idaho. June 25th, 2011, found myself and my brother sitting around a campfire near Stanley Lake, in beautiful Stanley, Idaho.  My brother had camped in the area for many years but it was my first time staying in the area.  We recounted old stories and watched the stars. As we viewed the night sky my brother whispered, Do you see that?   And as I followed his finger I saw what he was asking about.   At first it looked like a star but it flashed orange, red, yellow and a lime green color.  I've seen stars that flash colors but have always known them to be satellites or far off aircraft this particular star moved in zig-zagging motions.  It zipped in a  Z-like pattern, very quickly, then vanished below the tree line and out of sight. We continued watching the night sky and then saw two more stars flying in the same pattern and flashing the same colors.  We were not under the influence of alcohol, or any other substance, but seeing those strange objects made us feel like we were because it just felt so strange. My brother is a college student and I'm a recent college graduate.  We both heavily enjoy outdoor activities and have never seen anything remotely UFO-ish until just a few days ago.  The pattern they moved in and the speed they moved at is what has me convinced that they weren't any human made craft.;44.3714;-114.8561
