6 red light formation viewed in Donnelly, Idaho.;2014-08-12 22:30:00;5 minutes;6 red light formation viewed in Donnelly, Idaho. We are camping at Poison Creek.  There were three adults and two kids present.  We happened to be looking up at the sky because there were an abundance of shooting stars.  That is when I noticed a slow going formation of red lights.  There were four red lights across the top.  Beneath the top lights there was one light on each side (not directly under the lights but slightly out).   At first, we thought it was a series of helicopters, but it became apparent that helicopters would not fly so close together, nor would they stay in perfect formation throughout the flight.   There were also no white lights mixed in with the slow blinking red lights.  After watching this object in amazement for several minutes, it was suddenly out if view.
