Black triangle in the mountains of Idaho;1996-11-12 22:30:00;5 minutes;Black triangle in the mountains of Idaho We were leaving a restaurant in Cascade, on our way back to Donnelly.   I was sitting passenger seat and looked out the window.  It was an overcast night and the light reflecting off the clouds created a silhouette of a craft flying at low altitude (perhaps less than 1000 feet above the surface).  It hovered, I did not hear any sound.   As far as I can tell it was black with sides and angles that were all equal to each other.  It had white lights on each corner and one red light in the very center.   I was too stunned to say anything about it but when we got back to the house the woman in the car in front of us had seen it too and she was hysterical about it (I haven't told many people because of my mom's reaction to her friend seeing the same craft).   The mountains in that part of idaho block nearly all artificial light,  I was not under the influence of any type of substance and was clear-headed.   I have since learned that there have been many sightings in that part of Idaho. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));44.6664;-116.0339
