Red Orange round type object moving slowly in a cloudless sky over north Idaho.;2014-07-18 23:00:00;3 minutes;Red Orange round type object moving slowly in a cloudless sky over north Idaho I was looking out my living room window at the stars.  Then I see this large round red orange object.  At first I thought it was a red moon because of the fires in central Washington state.  Then I noticed that this single object was hovering at the height of a helicopter but made no sound.  This was a red orange roundish object moving very slowly north east. Not a fireworks display.  It stopped and then moved slowly south.  Stopped again and turned back going north east.  It hovered in the sky for a bit, moving up and down like a cork floating on water.  Then it moved ahead, a bit faster...and disappeared.  No clouds in the sky.  I haven't ever seen anything like this before.  Never seen a UFO before to my knowledge.;47.8233;-116.8892
