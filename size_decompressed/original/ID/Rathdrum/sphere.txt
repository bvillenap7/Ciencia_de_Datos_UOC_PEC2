My sighting was during the day.  They traversed from east to west at a fantastic speed. They had the same angular width in the sky as do the sun and moon, and they were bright like fire, and perfectly round.  I believe they were less than 5 miles in altitude. They followed one right after the other.  I had always believed what I saw to be ball lightening, until recently when I started researching this topic.  I have found that the orbs that I saw are being seen all over the world.  I donâ€™t know what to do with this info. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  Report originally indicated Colorado as the state where the sighting had occurred.  However, Rathdrum is in Idaho, we have changed the state, and re-posted the report, as of July 23, 2016.  PD));47.8233;-116.8892
