Large dim orange circular object travels across sky at enormous rate.;2013-07-11 23:40:00;5 seconds;Large dim orange circular object travels across sky at enormous rate. On the night of July 11, 2013, I was laying out stargazing with my children (12, 9), from about 11pm until 11:45pm.  During the course of the evening we had fun pointing out several satellites and shooting stars. At around 11:40 pm we were looking straight up and we all saw a very dull orange object about half the size of the full moon passes over in a very straight line and at an impossible rate.  It appeared to be lit from within.  The object covered the sky from horizon to horizon in about 5 seconds.  It was so dimly lit that it was hard to tell exactly where it was and appeared to be jumping or skipping across the sky.  I think that was only because my eyes were having trouble tracking it, being so dark and so dimly lit. It appeared to be very high and very large but I did not pick up any details on shape at all.  My son (12) who has younger eyes than I do said that he saw it as a round object with a lip or an inner circle close to the edge.;47.8233;-116.8892
