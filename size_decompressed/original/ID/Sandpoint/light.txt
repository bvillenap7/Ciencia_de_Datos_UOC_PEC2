We watched whatever it was decend closer and closer to the pond in my back yard. The light coming from the craft was so intense, we could hardly see anything else in the night sky. It was the strangest thing because there was no sound. My friend and I witnessed strange lights over my back yard. We watched whatever it was decend closer and closer to the pond in my back yard. The light coming from the craft was so intense, we could hardly see anything else in the night sky. It was the strangest thing because there was no sound. We live next to an air port, but planes do not hover over or around my house. Especially with those strange lights. All of the sudden, the craft just zoomed across the sky leaving a bright trail of light behind it.   My friend and I concluded that the crafte left because of an incoming airplane.;48.3148000000001;-116.5291
Bright light moving from west to east, which went from the horizon to directly overhead in less than a minute, with no sound.;2000-02-13 18:42:00;45 sec.;Bright light moving from west to east, which went from the horizon to directly overhead in less than a minute, with no sound. My husband and I were sitting on the front porch of our home (which we have done nightly for yrs). We observed a bright light come over the horizon above the tree line, moving at a tremendous speed. Initially we assumed it to be a low flying jet aircraft (rarely are any aircraft other than small private planes seen in this area at all)due to the extreme speed. The light came from a true north bearing of 268 degrees (my husband deals with map and compass locations on a daily basis), travelling almost due east (true bearing). As the light approached us, we expected to hear the engine of a possible military aircraft due to the fact that Fairchild AFB is approx. 80 miles SW of our location. When the light was directly overhead, it began to fade and finally disappeared. In spite of the fact that we waited a number of minutes, there was no sound whatsoever. It should be noted that our home is located in a very rural area, and the ambient sound is almost non-existant. We have absolutely no idea what we saw, but we have never seen anything like this before. We have lived at this location for 11 yrs.;48.3148000000001;-116.5291
Large flickering light low in the night sky that faded slowly away, but did not move.;2001-01-22 20:32:00;5 min;Large flickering light low in the night sky that faded slowly away, but did not move. Large flickering light low in the night sky.  Watched for about 5 min.  Tried to see it with a telescope, but it faded away. ((NUFORC Note:  Perhaps a sighting of Venus.  Witness does not indicate what direction the object was.  PD));48.3148000000001;-116.5291
Flashing erractic UFO;2007-08-27 22:00:00;1 hour;Flashing erractic UFO I was outside at my farm and I saw was looked like a planet. But then it started to flash red, white, yellow and blue. It would zoom up and down, back and forth as it hovered. It felt like it was as high up in the air as a jet would be. Just watching everything below. Thisis the second time I've noticed them from my yard. I'm curious if there have been any other north idaho, western montana sightings? Or if I'm jus seeing an ADD satelite?;48.3148000000001;-116.5291
