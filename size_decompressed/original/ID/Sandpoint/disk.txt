There were lights, and it seemed disclike in shape. My 2 young sons were with me, age 10 & 8, and observed the craft also. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

My brother and I ran outside where my mother already was to see where the music was coming from. When I got outside I saw a huge oblong saucer flying over our house. It was playing computer-generated type music. The object was flying maybe just a couple hundred yards above our house. I can also remember lights of every color changing and blinking throughout the ship. ((NUFORC Note:  Date in June 1983 is approximate.

Day time sighting UFO Saucer playing loud music.;1984-08-01 04:00:00;45 seconds;Day time sighting UFO Saucer playing loud music. After drawing my attention to the sky with the sounds of loud music, a UFO hovered over my house traveling at a slow speed. The size of the craft was around 40 feet in diameter hovering about 200 feet above the house. It was emitting a loud, distorted noise that could have been music. It was spinning slightly and moving at about 25-35 mph. It was saucer shaped and had various lights around the vehicle. The time was around 3 to 5 o'clock in the day. After staring in awe for around 10 seconds, I ran to  the front porch thinking where I could find a camera inside. I decided that I would miss the opportunity to see the craft again and therefore turned to watch the craft float off into the distance. My Mother, Brother, and I all stared at each other in bewilderment. My conclusion after all these years is that the research on the 1965 'Abrocar' experiment in Nevada was not cancelled. From my research, the hovering vehicle was manufactured in somewhere in Nevada and flown and tested in an air force base in Canada. It is possible that we witnesses the experimental vehicle en route to the testing facility. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

Very large disk shape, many portholes, silver in color, nestled between two hills;1995-08-15 21:00:00;one minute;Very large disk shape, many portholes, silver in color, nestled between two hills The sun had already gone down and the sky was still lit up slightly when our family, two daughters and my husband, were in our boat and going in to shore. My husband was steering the boat and my daughters and I were enjoying the scenery. As I was looking tomy right, I did a double take because I remember thinking quickly that the arrangement of the hills looked different than usual. I saw an extremely large, silver disk hovering (no sound) in between two hills and the port holes, many of them, were clearly visible. It was suspended and I could see the remainder of the darkening sky around the edges of it. I said to my husband What in the world is that? As I kept my eyes on it I looked then at my daughters and I think they were looking at the shoreline thinking that I was talking about a pretty home or something. I looked at my husband and I don't think he heard me because he didn't respond to my question. I think the engine of the boat was too loud. He still looked straight ahead. Then the hill to the north began to block the disk and it went out of my sight. I thought I should ask my husband to turn the boat around but at that time I couldn't believe that I even saw what I saw. I never did say a word to him afterwards. I did tell my oldest daughter eventually. It's a difficult subject to talk about. I continue to tell myself that I didn't really see it - but I know that I did. The image is as plain as ever.;48.3148000000001;-116.5291

Distance appeared to be about a mile. The object was less than 100 feet above the ground. The object simply blinked out of existance after a few seconds.  no sound.;48.3148000000001;-116.5291
