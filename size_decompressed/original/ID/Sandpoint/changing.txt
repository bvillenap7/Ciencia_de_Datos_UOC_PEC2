Only a small amount of people were affected by a random power outage, we were the few and stayed at a friend's house for a while till it came back on.   While driving home my boyfriend my brother, and I, all saw a line of very bright orange dots that were larger than any of the stars in the sky, (they almost looked like a bunch of Mars when it was at its closest to the earth).   We quickly parked and got out of the car to see what it could be, it stuck out like a sore thumb and we all thought maybe something was falling out of the sky, possibly space debris.   We moved up onto a nearby tall deck to get a better look and as we looked above the roof we saw very clearly, these three orange dots slowly form into a perfect equilateral triangle.  We all tried taking pictures, but none of our phones cameras were able to pick up on them.   As soon as it had formed a triangle it stopped and from left, to right it disappeared, then the top lingered a bit more and vanished as well.   Needless to say, we no longer belived it to be space debris.;48.3148000000001;-116.5291
