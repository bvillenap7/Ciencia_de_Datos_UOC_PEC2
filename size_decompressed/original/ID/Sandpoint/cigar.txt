Yellow oblong object tracked across evening sky over Sandpoint, ID.;2019-02-02 18:00:00;1 minute;Yellow oblong object tracked across evening sky over Sandpoint, ID. Between hours of roughly 5:30 pm and 6:30 pm PST on Feb 2, 2019, we were sitting in our hot tub.  It was dark night conditions with clouds and no stars visible.  Suddenly a yellow oblong shape tracked across the sky in a N - NNE route.  It would have been below the cloud cover.  There was no 'tail'.  It was distinctly not round, and not fully teardrop, but just oblong.   The event didn’t last more than 1 minute, and though I didn’t see it 'appear' because the hot tub lid obscured the view, it disappeared as a sort of blur that seemed to me that it was being obscured by clouds, as it headed away from us.  It was never directly over us as if trying to BE over us personally.  It just tracked along a bit to the east of our exact position as we looked up. It was a golden yellow color like campfire flame, not white or red or green as would normal aircraft lights be.  The entire shape was the same color, not blinking or shifting intensity, and not leaving behind a trail or tail of any kind.  The full shape just moved across the sky.  And there was no noise at all, but then again, we were in the hot tub and that was making noise.;48.3148000000001;-116.5291
