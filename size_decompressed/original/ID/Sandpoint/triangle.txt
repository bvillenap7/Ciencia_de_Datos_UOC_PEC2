Low flying projectile, mirror-like reflective surfaces, white colored.  Stealth fighter shaped. Low altitude, high rate of speed, no con-trail.   We turned onto Wrenco Loop and tried to follow the trajectory and took one photo, but the aircraft does not appear in the photograph.   It was quickly a tiny speck in the distance, much further than any hobby plane could be, too small to be manned, not a standard aircraft.   Two witnesses.   Called the local news, submitted the photo, odd streak in photograph, but no aircraft.;48.3148000000001;-116.5291
