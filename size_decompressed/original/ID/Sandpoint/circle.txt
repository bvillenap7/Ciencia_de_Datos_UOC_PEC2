Expand this picture to full circle.  Now give this picture three dimensions like multiple tear drops cotangent one to the other.  Paint them individually with primary colors.   This 300' wide craft was turning slowly and traveled west to east directly over head over Elliot Ave. in Sandpoint, ID.  By the time I grabbed a passerby for confirmation he could barely see it.   We did not discuss it and I have not looked for him since.  He saw it in the distance fading away.  I saw it directly overhead, silent, solid, sober.  I made a drawing to attach herein. My name is ((name deleted)).  My phone # is 208 ((number deleted)).  Let this conversation begin. Contact me by email....((e-address deleted)).  I will respond and attach my drawing. Yeah, I heard their voices many years ago.  A real pain in the ass.  No, I am not psychotic, felonious or bipolar.  I am a carpenter!  With no one to talk to about this. 64 years old ...too old to believe in a fantasy.  Honor your website.  Call me back.  No exposure sought here.  I don't do Face Book either.  No book to write or speech to make.  It's not my job.  It's your job.  Call me.  Email me.  Bud Hopkins ignored me. Alien telepathy is idiotic, not super intelligent.  Not even close. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he sounded to us to be quite sane and sober-minded.  We suspect that he is a very good witness.  He said he will submit an illustration of the object, and try to pin down the date of the sighting.  PD));48.3148000000001;-116.5291

And we were driving and looked up and about 150 ft above us was a gray circular object and we were lookin at the bottom of it which had several flashing lights on it.   We slammed on the brakes and as soon as we stopped the ship disappeared.;48.3148000000001;-116.5291

The second one blinked bright twice before quickly disappearing that was also a circular object there's no way any military craft or airplane would or could move at this speed my phones camera was static like looking before it clears and I got a shot.;48.3148000000001;-116.5291
