An aqua blue sphere with a long trail shot across the night sky.;2003-04-23 23:45:00;3 seconds;An aqua blue sphere with a long trail shot across the night sky. While riding my motorcycle north toward Sandpoint from the Westmond area on hwy. 95 at approx. 11:45 P.M. a very bright, aqua colored, round object with an extremly long trail, caught my attention as it came across the sky traveling from east to west and downward in a fashion that suggested it would impact the ground just out of my line of sight to the west. I expected to see a flash or perhaps feel a jolt from the event but neither occured. It was simply there and gone. The color was quite remarkable and unlike anything I have ever witnessed in the night sky due to a natural event (shooting star etc. etc.).;48.3148000000001;-116.5291
