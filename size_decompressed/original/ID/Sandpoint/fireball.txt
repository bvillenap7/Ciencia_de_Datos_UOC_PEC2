Completly silent the orange ball looked to have round or oval object above it and moving just at edge over cloud/fog cover.  Then it slowed and turned northeast then turned east again.  Then it almost did a left turn instantly heading north and increased speed out of sight while remaining completely silent.  I heard two jets come from east and north which both sounded like they continued south at high speed.  30 minutes later, I can hear jets at high altitude above cloud cover.
