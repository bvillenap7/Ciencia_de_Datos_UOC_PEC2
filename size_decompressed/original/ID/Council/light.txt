Interesting light formation in a forest near Council, ID.  ((NUFORC Note:  Round orb in photo is lens flare.  PD));2015-06-27 00:00:00;not sure;Interesting light formation in a forest near Council, ID. I used to work in Council ID until September of last year.  One of the girls that worked with me showed me a photo that her friend took when she was out on a walk with her dog. The image was taken before sunset near Council, ID.  She did not notice anything unusual initially but eventually they came across the interesting light in the distance when she was showing the photo to another person. I will email a photo to the email that was provided.  This looks very similar to the Orbs that I saw on the UFO unexplained files.  The only difference is that there was only one light. I am only bringing this to your attention.  I was not a witness of the episode.  If you would like to get more detailed information I can contact the individual that obtained the photo to try to get more details. Thank you. ((NUFORC Note:  Round, green orb in photo is lens flare, caused by pointing the camera at a bright source of light, in this case, the Sun.  Other photos submitted by same source show tiny, dark smudges above a nearby cliff.  Possible birds??  PD));44.7628;-116.4518
