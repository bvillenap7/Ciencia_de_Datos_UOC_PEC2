It was moving along the Spokane river in the Post Falls area, we live a very short distance from the river. We could see that it was following the river because of the direction that it was moving in. It was black and had white lights, with a red outline around the whole ship. It was very quite and graceful. We watched it has it moved up stream from us, I would say it got with in 100 yards of us. At it's closest point! We then observed the ship come to a complete stop and then suddenly take off straight out in to space.  I mean straight up! We never saw it again. It was just gone that fast. We have seen a lot of things in Idaho, I think this state is very high in it's sightings.;47.7281999999997;-116.9389
