I was in my bathroom brushing my teeth, when I heard this soft sighing sound, unlike anything I've ever heard before. I finished, and opened the door to see what it was. The rest of my family was asleep, so I searched around. It sounded as if it was coming from the laundry room, and I went in there and the window was open - it was coming from outside. I put on my slippers and a sweatshirt and opened my door to go outside, and it immediately got louder. I walked across my front yard and into the street and looked up. The sky was blurry in some parts, and it seemed only inches from my face. Then, I saw something move. It would turn on like a bright light, then fade and appear somewhere else. I blinked because I thought I was hallucinating. I watched, and it did it again. Then, I saw that it wasn't just appearing somewhere else, there were several of these lights. The sighing got louder and blew through my ears like wind, but I couldn't feel it anywhere except inside my h! ead. It vibrated through my head and was warm which was strange since the night was cold. Then, as one, the lights faded, and I could feel the warm sighing sound receding from my head. I blinked again, and the sky looked different, as if someone had turned me around and all the stars were backwards. I went back in after what felt like 10 minutes, and was shocked - it was already 2:00am.;47.7281999999997;-116.9389
