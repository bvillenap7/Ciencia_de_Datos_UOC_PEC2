Round light with pulsating lights that changed from red to blue and back again. ((NUFORC Note:  Twinkling star??  PD));2016-04-03 20:00:00;15 minutes;Round light with pulsating lights that changed from red to blue and back again. and also white light streaming off of it. On the evening of April 3rd, 2016, I glanced out the window and saw a stationary round light that had lights that seemed to be pulsating.  It also had a stream of light coming off of it that was white light.   Later, the stream of light did not appear to be there.  But was very evident when I saw it.  It did not move.  I studied it a bit but had to go in the house to attend to my client.  I am a care giver.  I went back out at 8:25 pm, and it was still stationary, and still had the lights. Then I went back out five minutes later and it was gone.  I saw the red and blue lights that changed colors.  I thought because it was stationary that it was something unusual.  I did not hear any noise during any of this sighting.  I was really sure that with the lights that seemed to pulsate it was a good reason to report it.  All total it was in my sight approximately 12 minutes.;47.7281999999997;-116.9389
