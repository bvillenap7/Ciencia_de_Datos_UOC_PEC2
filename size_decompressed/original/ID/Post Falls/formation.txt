At about 7:30 PM. I saw 2 dull orange dots of light slightly west of the Casiopia constellation. They followed exactly the same path across the sky from North to South. They only took 2 to 3 seconds to cross from Casiopia to the southern horizon.  Did anyone else see these?;47.7281999999997;-116.9389
