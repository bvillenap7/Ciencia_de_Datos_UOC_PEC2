As I was looking at one of the small blue breaks in the clouds above me and slightly to the west, when suddenly I noticed a round craft going through the break in the clouds heading from the northeast heading southwest. The craft was cloud-white colored on the bottom with the top part that I could see silver with a purple-blue dome on top with streaks of gold on the back part of the dome. I saw the craft for about three seconds (or less). Since I have realized that what I saw was a lot bigger than I thought at the time. The craft was thicker through the middle than the sides.
