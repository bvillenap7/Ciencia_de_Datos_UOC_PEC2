Unkn object following aircraft;2009-09-15 21:37:00;5 minuates;Unkn object following aircraft At approximately 2137 hrs, on 15 September 2009. Accompanied by my family and I on our front porch, observed a white light that appeared to be following an aircraft that was passing over the Post Falls/Coeur d' Alene Idaho area.   The unkn object was behind and to the left lower side within five miles trail.  As the aircraft and the unkn object passed by, another aircraft that had just left the Spokane Washington Airport, was also in trail of the aircraft and object.  All three lights flew across the sky at a reasonable speed to the east, until out of site.  Within 10 minuates an unkn object that is described as the first white light again flew accross the area. This time the object was going from the East to the West track. It is noted that all three aircraft were on a VECTOR of V448 that aircraft use as a major heading from the West coast to the East.;47.7281999999997;-116.9389

Bright light on mountain top by cell tower- receded behind mountain after 25 sec;2011-08-04 22:00:00;25 seconds;Bright light on mountain top by cell tower- receded behind mountain after 25 sec I was driving west on the freeway from Coeur d’Alene just entering Post Falls and coming down the hill by the first exit when I noticed an extremely bright light on a mountain top.   When just heading down the hill mentioned above, to your left you see a mountain with three cell towers on it.  Slightly to the right of that mountain is a smaller mountain with a single and smaller tower.   The light I saw was right next to the tower, appeared to be very close to the ground and was a brilliant white light, unmistakable despite the fact it was night time and the city was filled with lights.  It was much brighter than any other light in sight.   And then within 25 seconds it receded behind the mountain and was no longer in sight.  The light could compare to the brightness of several spotlights, it lit up the clouds around it.   But it wasn’t a spotlight, it did not shine upwards or in a cylindrical form, it was an oval shaped ball of light, far too bright to be explained. ((NUFORC Note:  We have altered the date above to August 4th, a more realistic date.  PD));47.7281999999997;-116.9389
White light particle beam with small ball-like head moving silently over Post Falls Idaho.;2013-10-30 06:05:00;8 seconds;White light particle beam with small ball-like head moving silently over Post Falls Idaho I saw a UFO in the southern sky.  It was traveling from east to West.  I was standing on my front porch looking at a constellation and suddenly I saw what first appeared to be a meteor but was traveling not as fast as a meteor--it resembled more a white particle beam with a white head on it.   It took about eight to ten seconds to get past the horizon and out of sight.  Fairchild Air Force base is 30 or 40 miles west of my residence.;47.7281999999997;-116.9389
Light with irregular flight pattern inconsistent for plane, sattelite or helicopter.;2013-12-23 17:30:00;5 minutes;Light with irregular flight pattern inconsistent for plane, sattelite or helicopter. On Monday December 23 at approximately 5:30 I was out on my porch facing due East when I observed a light brighter than a star and about the size of a planet with an irregular flight pattern.  The object I observed was at high altitude and went in, behind and or out of clouds.  The course of the object appeared random with small, distinct, directional changes, during which there was a slight increase in speed.  This movement to me seemed out of proportion with what would be possible for a helicopter.  The altitude also was more consistent with an airplane or even a satellite.  At first I thought it was a satellite because the vividness of it and its speed was similar however I have never seen the type of directional changes I observed from a satellite, plane or helicopter.  It was very cold outside so I went back inside after about 5 minutes.;47.7281999999997;-116.9389
Supposed satellite changes course after several flashes  in sky;2020-09-20 20:15:00;1 minutes;Supposed satellite changes course after several flashes  in sky Husband and myself were watching a supposed satellite in the southern sky, then saw four or five flashes each several seconds apart.  At first thought something was breaking up in the atmosphere, but then saw the satellite change course from north to  east, then north, and last saw it zipping off west.  Did we witness a battle in space?;47.7281999999997;-116.9389
