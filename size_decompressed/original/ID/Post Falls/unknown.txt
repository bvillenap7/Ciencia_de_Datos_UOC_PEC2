Anamoly in long exposure photo;2009-01-19 18:27:00;6 sec;Anamoly in long exposure photo I was practicing some amateur astrophotography with a Canon Powershot A560, 6 second exposure, ISO 200. During previous shots I noticed a few satellite/airplane type points of light moving across the sky. After taking the photo, it was during review on the computer I noticed the strange object that appeared and the end of the light trail. I am by no means a photo analyzer, I would think that the object at the end of the light trail should appeared streaked similar to the trail. Look at the end of the trail just above and to the left of the window. The object is moving south. If you zoom in on the object it is a strange shape. Attached is the unaltered, original photo.;47.7281999999997;-116.9389
Extra, extra, extra wide and brief contrail behind a craft flying south over Kootenai county 9/15/14.;2014-09-15 11:30:00;5 minutes;Extra, extra, extra wide and brief contrail behind a craft flying south over Kootenai County 9/15/14. HUGE HUGE HUGE contrail that was 30 times wider than anything I have ever seen from a commercial aircraft.  The contrail lasted only for a matter of a few seconds- at the same time there was a commercial jet flying that had a typical long skinny or average contrail behind it lasting for many minutes at the same time the ufo was in view.  No sound from the craft.  It was flying south. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.  PD));47.7281999999997;-116.9389
Orange ball of light flying near cell tower in Post Falls Idaho on Halloween at about 8:30 pm local time.;2019-10-31 20:30:00;3-5 minutes;Orange ball of light flying near cell tower in Post Falls Idaho on Halloween at about 8:30 pm local time. While driving in a residential neighborhood on Halloween, at about 8:30 pm Pacific Time, I spotted a bright orange light, ball shaped, floating by the red lights of a distant cell phone tower. The orange ball was slightly below the halfway point of the cell tower, drifting slowly. As I watched it made a looping maneuver quite quickly, and ended up higher in the sky. After that it held very still, only drifting slightly and slowly faded out over the course of about a minute. When first spotted the object moved in front of the tower, if it was close to the tower it would have probably been between a refrigerator and a car in size. Its possible it could have been a drone but it seemed too large and I have never seen a drone with a big orange light on it like that. Considering there were many people out walking around that night, itâ€™s possible someone else saw it.;47.7281999999997;-116.9389
