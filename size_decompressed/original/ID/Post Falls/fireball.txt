Observed fireball with other cars stopped by side of highway for approx. 20 minutes. I was driving eastbound on Interstate 90 going towards the ID\WA State line and I noticed 3 cars parked on the side of the highway. Then I glanced up at the east sky and I saw what appeared to be a fireball. My first thought was that it could have been an airplane on fire. It was approx. 200 feet above the ground. After driving closer to it I noticed it was spinning at a high rate of speed in a very tight circle. I am color blind so I could not observe what color it was.  It appeared to be hovering at this time. For the last 2 or 3 minutes it appeared to be in motion going away from us toward Spokane WA. Then entire event lasted approx. 20 minutes until it was completely out of sight. The light level was dusk almost dark. I am a student at North Idaho College.;47.7281999999997;-116.9389
