Both my so and I were awakened.  No noise or anything, we were just awake out of the blue.  Then the sky just flashed a light.  There was no sound of thunder or rain or wind or anything of a weather change for bad, it was a quiet mellow night.  Two minutes later another flash and then another and another.  They appeared to be going north towards Creston BC.  The second to the last one appeared to be like something like a blast that blew out like it was on the ground blasting outwar and then the last one was in the same vicinity but to the east of the last one. The weird part was my waking up, like I was awakened on purpose.  This happened to me once before when in Portland Oreon every night at the same time I was awakened automatically to see a bright flashing spinning oval shaped thing in space that seemed to spark off colour and on the last night I awoke and ran outside to suddenly see it flash like an explosion bright neon like green for miles across the sky.  I reported that to the nasa communication and 2 days later the townspeople of Chehallis Washington who were up at night in the town all witnessed the same coloured light flash.;48.7238;-116.3388
