Witnessed a fireball in the western sky above the Owyhee Mountains just before sunset.;1980-06-01 18:00:00;unknown;Witnessed a fireball in the western sky above the Owyhee Mountains just before sunset. I was approximately five years old at the time.  I was playing with my neighbor on my front porch.  I noticed the fireball in the sky in the western horizon.  The sun was just out of view under the crest of the mountain range.  What is strange about the fireball is that it seemed to hypnotize me.  All I remember is just staring at it.  It did not appear to move vertically or horizontally.  It did not get closer or farther away. After a period of time it just was gone.  I did not know what a UFO was at the time.  I never told anyone other than my family, nor did I ever talk to my neighbor about it. I don't even know if my neighbor saw it, although he was with me.  I don't recall talking to him about it at the time it occured, either. Although I have been fortunate enough to see unidentified flying objects since, I have not seen anything resembling the fireball on that summer evening, nor have I seen anything as significant. I would like to know if any one else has seen anything like this.  The experience was sublime.  Even as a child, I sensed something sacred perhaps that is the irony of my curiosity after all this time.  If anyone is interested in sharing info, feel free to email me.  I have other information to share. Thank you.;43.619;-116.9472
