We were driving home heading west and my brother said, Did you see that?   I hadn't seen anything so I looked where he said it had been and there was a strange squarish orange light in the sky above the horizon quite a ways and a couple miles down the horizon there was another squarish orange light above the horizon but not quite as high as the other.  He tried to get his camera out but it had disappeared.  We waited a few seconds and it never reappeared.;42.194;-113.872
