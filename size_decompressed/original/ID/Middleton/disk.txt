The object floated in a smooth and straight line passing over our heads and toward the direction of the firework show until it disappared from my view behind the trees.  When this happened all four of us experienced strange feelings in our heads.  After that an airplane with large light green lights at the ends of the wings circled the area a couple of times before flying directly to where the light did then the plane too disappeared.;43.7157;-116.6104
