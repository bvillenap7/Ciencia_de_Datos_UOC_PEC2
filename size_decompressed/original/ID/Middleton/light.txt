Something hovering with strobing lights.;2016-07-08 22:00:00;1 minute;Something hovering with strobing lights. On the night of July 8th, about 10:00, I was getting ready for bed when I heard a noise and thought someone was pulling into our driveway.  There was a yellow-orange light strobing outside our window.   Thinking it was a police car, I looked out to see.  There wasn't anything in the drive but whatever it was stayed in one spot about 45 seconds.  Then I heard  noise like power building up steam and whatever it was took off.  I couldn't see anything ground level that accounted for it and nothing pulled onto the road at the end of drive.   My husband heard the noise and thought it was somebody playing with a drone.  I didn't think they were that big or made that much noise.  It wasn't a helicopter, no chopper blades.            ;43.7157;-116.6104
Line of bright white illuminated projectiles;2020-12-04 19:15:00;5 minutes;Line of bright white illuminated projectiles girlfriend and I saw between 10-12 white illuminated objects moving from an SW to NE direction in the sky at night. They appeared to be coming from ground-level, reaching several thousand feet into the air. They were fairly slow-moving and faded-out seconds after first appearing on the horizon. The looked similar to flares, but were slower, bright white and all following the same path, forming a perfect line in the sky. They were spaced about a second apart from one another.;43.7157;-116.6104
