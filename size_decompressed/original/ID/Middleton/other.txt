Five reddish orange, circular lights were seen with three of them appearing in a rather big triangle pattern.  They seemed to pulse faintly and moved too slowly and smooth for it to be anything we would recognize as being normal.   The lights hovered for a while in the distance, never really moving, and slowly blinked out one at a time over a 2-3 min period.  The night sky was relatively clear and the objects were clearly something strange to us.  I obviously found it strange enough to report it to somebody and hope someone finds interest in this as I have.;43.7157;-116.6104
