2 colorful objects hovering over near Exit 17 and colorful objects zipping through sky;2019-10-06 20:17:00;15 seconds;2 colorful objects hovering over near Exit 17 and colorful objects zipping through sky As my friend and I were about a mile on the freeway from sand hollow exit, we noticed two extremely bright lights about 40 feet in the air above us.  As we came closer to them I noticed one was closer to the ground than the other hovering to the left.  As we were right beneath them I say red blue and green lights underneath both the objects.  As the night went on my friend and I kept seeing these objects in the sky that appeared to be falling at a rapid speed and then they would shoot either up again or to the side.  I could see the different colors spin in the air as it would zip around in different directions.  I believe that they were the same objects that were hovering over the freeway.;43.7157;-116.6104
