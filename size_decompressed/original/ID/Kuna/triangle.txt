Triangular object with pulsating lights hovered near Meridian Rd., then slowly flew off towards Boise, ID;2003-11-20 19:00:00;5-6min;Triangular object with pulsating lights hovered near Meridian Rd., then slowly flew off towards Boise, ID The object hovered off the eastern side of Meridian Rd.  It had 4 sets of pulsating lights underneath, two long ones in the middle, two shorter ones on either side of the long ones.  They reminded me of pill-bugs or fireflies.  There were also lights on the wingtips of the object, green on the left, and red on the right.  It appeared to be about 150 - 200 feet off the ground, about the size of a helicopter (the end of my thumb would JUST cover it at my arm's length).  After about 20 seconds or so of hovering, it moved eastward, towards Boise, ID, the bottom lights still pulsating, the wingtip lights still flashing. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
