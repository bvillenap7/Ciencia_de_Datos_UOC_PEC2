After driving home from work I saw a chevron shape figure fly over my car.  The craft changed the colors of the flashing lights like no other spacecraft I have seen do before from lime green, blue, red, purple, and to transparent orange.  (Flashing lights)   The object also seemed to have been communicating to other crafts around, because I would see white flashes back to the shuttle every so often.
