Shiny silver ball moving west to east in daylight over Kuna, Idaho.;2015-10-18 18:00:00;1 minute;Shiny silver ball moving west to east in daylight over Kuna, Idaho. I believe it was Sunday, October 18th.   I was driving south on Ten Mile road between Meridian and Kuna, Idaho.   It was early evening and the sun was to the west.  I observed a spherical object in the sky moving west to east.  It looked like a big shiny silver ball.  It caught my attention because the sun was reflecting off the surface and I could see the curvature of the object but no tail or wings.  It looked like a silver ping pong ball.  I don’t think it was a Mylar balloon because it moved smoothly east with no deviation or bobbing.  It was quite high in the sky and my rough guess is that it would have been about 25 to 30 feet in diameter.     I slowed my vehicle and watched it move steadily across the sky.  I found a place to pull over and after parking my vehicle, I tried to find it again and it was gone.  The sky was clear, no clouds and no trees or other obstructions.  It should have been there because it wasn’t moving very fast.  It was just gone!   The total length of my observation was probably 45 seconds to a minute.
