Light formation fading in and out, merging, and changing shape.;2016-10-19 19:45:00;24 minutes;Light formation fading in and out, merging, and changing shape. I was in Meridian, ID, area, southbound on Ten Mile Rd, from I-84 exit to Columbia Rd..  Initially saw one orange light in the sky closer to Kuna, moving  SSE light “turned off” and faded like a flame being snuffed out another appeared next to it, fading in simultaneously. Eventually the second light faded and the first lit up simultaneously this went back and forth for almost half an hour, and, at times, included a third light, sometimes appearing to split from one of the others, rejoin, or appear a short distance away from the others.   No sound was audible, but lights were also about 20 miles away (UFO's were at approx. 43.173268, -116.184782). Passenger also noticed lights’ behavior, as did resident at our destination.  Lights were too far away for my camera to take video or still images.;43.4845;-116.3821
