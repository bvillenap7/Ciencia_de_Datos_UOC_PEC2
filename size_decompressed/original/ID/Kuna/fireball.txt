My wife and I were walking our dogs along the New York Canal, near Kuna, ID, shortly before 7:00 a.m., when suddenly, she said, look at that!.  It was still dark, and looking northward, towards the town of Meridian, was a bright greenish-white obect or objects moving at a high rate of speed in a roughly east to west direction.  The light seemed to be split in-two, as if it had a double flare-like appearance.  The object(s) appeared to be only several thousand feet above ground at this point as it would have been beneath the light cloud cover existing at the time.  We soon lost sight of object as it dissapeared behind a grove of trees, but seemed headed some where to the south of Ontario, OR.  There were no aircraft landing, amber or strobe lights associated with this, and I assumed this was probably a meteor which may have broken in two.  I did hear a slight roaring sound at the time not sure if associated with this or other aircraft in the area.  If the FAA has radar data pertaining to this from the Boise airport or Mountain Home AFB, it may be possible to track a possible landing site of meteorite in western Idaho or eastern OR.;43.4845;-116.3821

Moved slowly across the sky from west to east.t Kuna, Idaho, September 22, 2014, at approximately 10:30 pm, my husband and I saw a large orange pinkish glow float thru the air from West to East.  We were able to watch it for about 15 seconds before it was either out of sight, or disappeared. We were in our backyard In Kuna Idaho watching the stars.  We enjoy laying in our hammock at night relaxing and watching the night skies.
