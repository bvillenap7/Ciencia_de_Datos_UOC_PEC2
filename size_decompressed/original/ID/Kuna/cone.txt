Light with cone shaped mist.  ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.  PD));2015-11-07 19:05:00;3 minutes;light with cone shaped mist We both perceived the same thing--a stationary cone-shaped light about 100 ft above a field a couple hundred yards off the road.  As we drove closer, the light faded and there was a cone-shaped mist/fog where the light had been, and it began to disperse rather quickly.  Weird. ((NUFORC Note:  U. S. Navy missile launch.
