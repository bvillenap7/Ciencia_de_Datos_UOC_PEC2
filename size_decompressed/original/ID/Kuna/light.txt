Two strings of lights traveling from SW to NE that totaled about 40 lights over about 20 minutes.   ((Starlink satellites));1989-11-08 21:10:00;25 minutes;Two strings of lights traveling from Southwest to Northeast that totaled about 40 lights over the course of about 20 minutes. There was a string of approximately 25-30 lights traveling on the same path from Southwest to Northeast. They were fairly evenly spaced with 5 or 6 being visible at the same time in the sky. After that group passed there was another group of at least 11 that were traveling in same general direction but originated further to the west. The total duration was about 20 minutes and they looked to be flying way higher than a jet.;43.4845;-116.3821
Strange light passed over my vehicle and vanished.;2013-04-29 22:05:00;15 seconds;Strange light passed over my vehicle and vanished. Driving to work I saw a low object heading northwest from the southeast.  At first I thought it was a helicopter but could not see the shape of the craft, only a light.  The light was constant and not blinking but slightly changing colors. After about 15 seconds the light faded and vanished after it passed over the top of my car.  I rolled down my window to listen for any sound of an aircraft but heard nothing.  The object was to low and slow to be a satellite or a meteor.  I estimate the object to be at an altitude of 1 thousand to 2 thousand feet off the ground. When I arrived at work, I told a coworker and he said he witnessed the same object.;43.4845;-116.3821

They faded off then came back on within 10 seconds several times, no airplane/red lights on top.  They stayed to the left of us going towards the falls (south).  We never caught up our passed them. After getting to Dedication Point there was 4 lights, then they faded off and never came back on.   We went on down to the falls (5 miles) for an hour, never saw them again on the way back or on any other trip out there.   Our 1 dog was very restless the whole time and has acted very sedated since.;43.4845;-116.3821

10-15 yellow orbs floating upward, then east to west, before they descended and disappeared.;2016-06-24 00:00:00;20 minutes;10-15 yellow orbs floating upward, then east to west, before they descended and disappeared. I saw 10-15 yellow orbs floating upward in the sky.  They moved east to west and began to descend on to the earth one by one.  As they descended, many of the lights went out leaving only 6 or 7 remaining lit.  Some lights came back on after having disappeared for a few seconds.  The last light to go out hovered over the earth.  I never saw it come down.;43.4845;-116.3821
