When it got overhead I could see that it was a disk shaped object or a sphere.  It moved slowly at first and hovered for seconds at a time.  It moved in a fluid way back and forth.  Came from south to the north and then turned about 75 degrees to the East.  I watched it for about 3 minutes until it was headed out of my view, then I ran to my car and headed east out of town.  I got out of town and spotted it.  I saw it for only about 1 minute before it began to speed up, then it was just gone.  It sped up fast and vanished, I could not discern where it went.  There was no sound to this object that I could hear over the small amounts of noise in my neighborhood.  I am able to hear planes and helecopters, and this I could not hear at all.  This object didn't appear to be extremely high in the sky(like a jet would be), only at about the same height that a helecopter or small airplane would fly.  Also no blinking lights like on a plane or helecopter. And no chem trail visible (a bright night sky).;45.9258;-116.1024
