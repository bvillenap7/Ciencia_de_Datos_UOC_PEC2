I was outside smoking a cigarette when I noticed some bright lights behind a tree, and at first thought they were very bright stars.  I moved past the tree and saw that they were moving! I observed 7-8 glowing orange orbs that appeared to pulse other colors very rapidly.  I ran inside the house to get someone else to see what I was seeing. By the time I got my father-in-law outside they had disappeared.  I didn't hear of anyone else seeing anything strange that night, so it's a little disheartening, but I know that I saw something unexplainable. And it define was not Chinese lanterns!  I reported the sighting to MUFON that night but am just now making a report here.;45.9258;-116.1024
