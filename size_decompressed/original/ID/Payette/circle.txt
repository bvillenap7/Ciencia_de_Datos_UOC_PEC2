I was coming up first ave s. when I saw light reflecting metal and it caught my eye long enough for me to see t change into a white cirular object moving across the sky. I found it interesting enough to pull over and I notice there wasnt any stream behind it like planes you see coming and going from the Boise airport. It was moving faster than a plane and as I was watching it fly n.w. I saw another one pass some distance under it going another diretion. My Daughter wanted to get home so Once I got there I got out of my car and searched for the object again. My husband came out to help me unload the car and we searched the sky and found a the object hovering high up in the sky. after we watched it and went through most explanations and decided it was preety unexpainable. My son asked me to pick him up and when I looked back up it was gone. We search the sky in all directions but didnt see it anywhere t had just disappered!;44.0755;-116.9247
