2 ufos scanning the area, moving fast and more nimble than anything we have on earth;2015-05-24 19:30:00;2 hours+;2 ufos scanning the area, moving fast and more nimble than anything we have on earth At about 7:30, me and my wife drove to paddock resivour to look at the scean.  The sun had just barely fell under the west side of the hills when we noticed a bright white light, blinking, in the sky.  We thought it was a plane until it stops blinking and started hovering in one spot. It startes to grow so big that it was the size of my pinkie nail when held in front of me.  It looked like a disk with a tiny bump on the top in the middle and we could see 3 very skinny legs on the bottom of the craft.  It could not have been a star because stars do not grow in size, move position at extremely high speeds, or hang out in our atmosphere underneath the clouds.   Shortly after watching this craft we noticed another one appear near the moon, moving in the same fashion but never entered the atmosphere.  Keep in mind that it was still light out.  We drove home and they were still there, however after about 2 and a half hours one zoomed away so fast that within an instant it was the size of a star and was gone.;44.0755;-116.9247
