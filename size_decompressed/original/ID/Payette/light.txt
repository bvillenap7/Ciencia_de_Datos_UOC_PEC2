Flashing light moving erratically for sustained period of time.;2001-01-06 07:15:00;45 min.;Flashing light moving erratically for sustained period of time. For the last two evenings and this morning, observed a point-source of light, strobing red/green/white rapidly.  Object exhibited random and fairly rapid motions in all directions around a central point.  Object approx. NW of Payette @ ~ 30 deg. inclination.  Object too far too discern any shape, even w/ binoculars.  Definite random motion in all planes observed by both myself and wife. ((NUFORC Note:  We note that the report is not inconsistent with a twinkling star.  However, we do not know what the witnesses observed.  PD));44.0755;-116.9247
Third consecutive night of sighting.  Very active tonight.;2001-01-06 19:00:00;~ 1 hour;Third consecutive night of sighting.  Very active tonight. Third consecutive night of sighting, in addition to this morning at 0715.  Very active this evening.  Very pronounced zigzag motions, though not extremely abrupt. Object was higher in sky this evening at first sighting, ~35 deg inclination, and a bit further west of Northwest. Over the course of an hour, object dropped slightly, and moved somewhat north.  Again, lights are strobing between red, green, and white. Called Payette County Sherrif's Office, but no corroborating reports at this time. ((NUFORC Note:  We observe that the motion described by the witness is consistent with how a star or planet would be seen to move in the northwestern sky.  PD));44.0755;-116.9247
