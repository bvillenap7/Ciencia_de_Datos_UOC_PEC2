The light was many times brighter than the stars in the background. The light was proceeding in a southeast direction and traveling very slowly.  As it came closer to me it appeared to become as bright as a city lit up in the heavens.  The object had a triangle shape to it with immense bright lights down each side of it.  This ufo was about 3000 to 4000 feet above me and slowly glided past me without making a sound. I could not gauge the deminsions of the craft but suspect that it may have been hundreds of feet long.  It went directly over my head and then. zip it was gone.  I am now a firm believer in ufo's.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
Two large amber glowing objects over Nampa/ Caldwell  Idaho;2011-08-03 22:49:00;10 minutes;Two large amber glowing objects over Nampa/ Caldwell  Idaho At 1049 My wife went out on the back patio for a cigarette, She immediately saw two amber glowing objects right next to each other about  9 o’clock in the sky. 10 times bigger than the brightest  star. She called me after figuring out they were not air craft. I came out and also saw the two objects. One was just below the second.  Both were very bright amber colored.  Radiating out light and floating with no sound.  The lower one started dimming and started to drop and eventually dimmed out. The upper one started to go away from us and get higher and slowly dimmed out. I called my son who finally made it out and also witnessed.  The total time was about 3 minutes. I started this report and called back out,   It’  back!  Approximately 11:08 pm.  My son had grabbed binoculars and  both he and my wife saw that it was triangular in shape and sold color.  I caught about 15 seconds of video and it went back up and away from us.  My son thought he saw a light come out! of one object and shoot downwards. Seen to the north west direction. My son is 20 years old.,  My wife a house wife and I have been a manager for 20 years. Seen a lot of things but nothing like this.  I kept thinking if some one was hoaxing with a flare but it was about 1500 yards from  us if not closer and no sputtering or strobe that you would see from a flare and no wobbling if something tied to a balloon and released. I got the first on my phone video and need to review yet.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
White object with no light.;2014-10-18 21:05:00;20 seconds;white object with no light me and my girlfriend just stepped outside to smoke a cigarette, right after we walked out the door we saw a shooting star, 1 minute later she went inside, and i saw something white, not really a light, but maybe like a white bird, that was my first thought, but it was moving way too fast to be a bird, and it was heading south, towards the spot of the shooting star. it seemed to reflect sunlight the further away it got.  i went back inide and told the family what i had seen, then went back outside, my girlfriend joined me 30 seconds later, and 30 seconds after that she said she just seen a big white object, moving very fast to the north. i asked her what it looked like, and her description matched what i had seen, only bigger.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
Triangle shaped object with 3 blinking bright blue lights over Nampa heading towards Boise.;2015-09-23 05:54:00;1 minute;Triangle shaped object with 3 blinking bright blue lights over Nampa heading towards Boise. While driving to work on Karcher road I spotted 3 bright blue lights in the shape of a triangle.  The lights were blinking not in unison but one at a time, going from right to left to center.  While watching the object, the blue lights switched from 3 down to 1 blinking blue light.  The object did not appear to be moving at a high speed and was heading towards Boise.  There were no other colored lights on the object- Blue lights only! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Smallish triangle of lights slowly moving.;2020-05-19 23:08:00;10 seconds;Smallish triangle of lights slowly moving. My good friend and I were out late long boarding and messing around, when the sky became brighter for some odd reason.  We didn't think anything of it really until my friend looked up and her face was blank with expression.  Silenced. I looked up to see what she was looking at and it was a bunch of lights forming a smallish triangle slowly heading West.  After a couple seconds it speeded up and completely disappeared in the clouds.  I've never seen anything like it.  I didn't believe in aliens really until now. It makes my stomach turn just thinking about it.  I might sound crazy, but this wasn't just another strangely shaped airplane.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187

As it got closer we could see the lines around it but the other sides weren’t illuminated. Our best estimation is that it was about  three football fields long. It looked like it was half the size of the town even at skyline level. It was traveling from Caldwell towards Boise at a slow cruising speed. It quickly sped up and vanished shortly after that.  I got a video but it was so dark it’s hard to see anything. If a video editor can enhance the image it will be able to be seen.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
