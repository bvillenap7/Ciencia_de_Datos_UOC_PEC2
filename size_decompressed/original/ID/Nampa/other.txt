July 2005 Meridian field lights -- night flights of cropdusters?;2005-07-15 22:00:00;30 mins;July 2005 Meridian field lights -- night flights of cropdusters? I live south of Nampa, Idaho -- a community near the recent July 2005 sightings of bright lights over fields in Meridian. I have an educated guess (?) as to what those folks saw, because I saw a similar thing in the fields around my house at about 10 p.m. on July 15.  At about 10 p.m., I went to the sliding glass door of the master bedroom to let my dog out onto the patio. The back of my house, patio, and long backyard face west. I heard a plane flying low overhead, which is not unusual because I am between the Nampa Municipal airport and the Owyhee Mtns to the south/southwest lots of folks like to take small planes from that airport and sightsee. I thought maybe it was someone returning late from a trip into the Owyhees at this point, it's mostly dark, with just a hint of pinkish sunset left to the northwest of us, toward Nampa and Caldwell. (Idaho daylight and sunsets are long in the summer.)  I was surprised to see a plane just RIGHT THERE, heading south along Track Road, arced in a sharp curve and obviously making a U-turn back toward the north (back toward Deer Flat Rd). When the plane was facing me head-on (the plane was now facing east, toward Meridian/Boise), I saw that across the front of the plane there were 3 round, bright white lights, along with a very small colored light on each wing tip. (I believe one was green and one was red, although on subsequent passes/turns, I also saw blue wing-tip lights -- guess FAA regulations dictate which lights have to shine depending on what motion you are performing?)  As the daughter of a retired pilot/cropduster, I realized it was a cropdusting plane. (Although I admit I did not realize you could operate them after dark -- thought it was a safety hazard.) I watched as the pilot crossed Deer Flat Rd -- the pilot then popped on a bank of REALLY bright white (almost pale yellowish) lights on the underside of the plane. When I say really bright, I mean bright enough that I could see not only the tops of the onion plants he was spraying in that dark field, but the mist of the chemical coming out of the spray jets.  I watched for several minutes as he swooped low to the ground and arced and turned and popped his various sets of lights on and off while he dusted the field -- quite a skilled pilot in a nimble plane.  I was amused to think that it reminded me of some scenes in Close Encounters with the craft zooming down the road and thought, Well, if you weren't close enough to hear the engine, you'd think it was a UFO!  Then I got to thinking about the Meridian reports I'd read earlier that week... At that point, I grabbed a notebook and tried to sketch out the lights in order to compare it to the report I'd read on the NUFORC site. After a couple minutes, I thought about getting the camera, but by the time I'd located it, realized I needed the flash, went back in and located the flash, then went back out to the patio, the plane had changed fields and was spraying fields west of Track Road toward Powerline (where it dead-ends at Star Pass Ridge). That was a somewhat eerie sight, seeing those lights pop on and off from behind one of the rare stands of trees in the area.  When I came back to the NUFORC site today, I see that the Meridian reports are front-and-center and that the folks are going to be on the Coast-to-Coast AM show soon. Now, I obviously can't swear for certain that this is what those folks saw in Meridian around the first of the month, but there are lots of fields and agricultural operations in the western edge of Meridian/eastern edge of Nampa (the garage farms haven't taken over all of it, yet!), and it IS cropdusting season (apparently even at night). And if they had burning eyes, it could be from the poison the plane was spraying on the crops. Plus, one witness' drawing DID describe the object as having a plane shape.  So that's just my information to offer as a possible explanation of what might be an IFO instead of a UFO. Please note, if relevant, that I am a MUFON member.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
Strange object in photo;2006-07-19 18:33:00;Short;Strange object in photo I'm a Realtor and was taking pictures of a house to put on the flyer and internet. I never noticed anything at all until I looked at the pictures on my computer. The pictures are taken with a digital camera that records information about the pictures so it tells what date they were taken and time. The one picture has a strange object in the sky above the house. When I looked at it the first time I never thought anything about it. I thought maybe it was on the lens, but none of the rest of the pictures taken at the same time have that object in them. I'm not saying it's anything, but you can look at the photo and the others taken at the same time and decide for yourself. I was looking north east when the picture was taken.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
Flying object over Nampa Idaho on the 4th of July;2013-07-04 23:00:00;3 minutes;Flying object over Nampa Idaho on the 4th of July This flying object was seen by at least 6 ppl and 2 children that were out celebrating the forth.  It was seen first in the southwestern part of the sky going northeast.  It was slow enough to grab some others attention but not long enough to grab every ones attention at the party.    When I saw it it was right above me what I saw was a center circle that supplied the lights red blue orange yello and white.   The lights were bright enough that I could also see about the 2 5 7 10 o'clock position around the light were other circular flat surface that were silver or gray in color.   If you were to draw a line from one circular corner to the next it would be square shape.  If no lines were drawn, it would look like equal cross.   Made no noise and seem to be flying lower then what a small plan would fly. Adults ages ranged from 26-32that saw it and children 10 and 8 no alcohol present.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187

I am a stargazer and loved watching the night sky.  Suddenly towards the North I saw a firey meteor come down and thought, Wow, that was a great meteor  A couple minutes later a craft appeared overhead, slowly, silently, approched towards me over the house located behind me.  It was glowing red, like heated metal, the entire craft.  It was square and flat like a thick book.  It just slowly moved closer, estimating it was about 1/4 mile away.  The size of a one story home.  As I stood there in astonishment, it was nothing like I expected a UFO to look like, but there it was slowly approaching in a smooth, slow, gliding like movement then it banked in a turn towards the west and did a U turn towards the North.  It was the most amazing thing I had ever seen.   After completing its slow moving U turn it just continued its slow movement towards the North un! til it was out of sight.  The direction it came and left took it over the nearby Rt 84.  There is also a train depot nearby that had to have seen it since it was so bright, glowing red and so large, since the train depot for freight operates 24 hours and I can hear the connecting of rail cars from my home.  Also nearby is Caldwell Airport, a medium sized private airport and I believe it is controlled, but not sure if it is 24 hours.  I really don't care who believes me or not and that is to be expected.  I know what I saw and there isn't craft like I ever had seen before.   There were no signs of windows or anything, just a square shaped craft, silent, glowing hot red, smooth all over and flat, meaning the height or thickness was about 1/4 that of the square distance of the overall craft.  It was also glowing red uniformly over the entire craft.  I can see it clearly in my mind ever since.   I was watching a UFO documentary on TV about a year ago about a UFO sighting near a! military base in Utah that looked and flew almost exactly fro! m the on e I saw.  It however was traingular shaped and the sides had lines from top to bottom all the way around.  It made me wonder if mine only appeared to be square due to the angle it approached me, but it did expose its under belly to me during its turn and it looked square.   I didn't report it because I didn't know who to report it to, but there must have been many other witnesses being it flew over the freeway and stood out so much in color, glow, size and very unusual shape.  The timeline besides the 2am has faded over time.  I estimate it was in the spring of 2015 but I could be a year off at this point.  I wish I can find out if others reported it, but have no clue who would have that information.   I only found this website after reading an article yesterday about a recent sighting also here in Nampa which included video.  It looked nothing like my sighting but if you could advise me who may have records that I can research I would greatly appreciate it. My email is pa19! 8th@aol.com;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187

I was standing outside in our back yard looking at the stars, then I noticed a real strange looking one as it came close very fast it was like 3 or 4 lights in a line going up and down and two more came up right behind it one of the set of lights took off quickly heading east out north east and the other two stayed for about an half an hour;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
2 small circular crafts seen within a period of 30min minutes from each other while another triangular shaped craft was found 1hr later;2017-06-28 21:30:00;90 minutes;2 small circular crafts seen within a period of 30min minutes from each other while another triangular shaped craft was found 1hr later Two small circular white crafts were found in the sky at the God and Country Festival.  The first one was found further out in the distance and seemed to disappear with in thin air.  The second one was noticed about 30min later above the area which also disappeared a few seconds later.  The last UFO was seen after the fireworks display behind where the display was being held.  It was triangular in shape and dimly lit.  It seemed to be turning at the moment it was noticed.  Phones were acting odd in the area.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187

Since I had to get back inside and back to work I can't say exactly how long they stayed visible;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
