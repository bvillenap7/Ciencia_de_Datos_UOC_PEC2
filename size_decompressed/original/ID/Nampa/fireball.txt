Incredible fireball breaking up over S/W Idaho;2006-06-01 21:37:00;3-5 seconds;Incredible fireball breaking up over S/W Idaho A bright light caught my eye from the East, I turned and managed to say Now, what is this?  In that time had moved almost directly Northeast of us.  As it streaked across the sky at an amazing pace.  We could see what appeared to be burning chunks breaking off of the fireball and burning up.  As it shot it's way on a Northwestern path it burned itself out.  There was no sound, and no smoke or vapor trail.  It was intensely bright, very noticable in the dusky evening sky.  It was not completely dark out as there was still a bright western sky.  It's path was a straight line going from Southeast to Northwest.  Looking East, East being twelve o'clock, it was sighted at one o'clock and shot to our northern side burning out at the eight o'clock position while traveling in the same straight line.  It may have been a meteorite, but never have I seen one that was so bright, incredibly close or large, that lasted for several seconds.  I only witnessed it for three to five seconds, who knows how long it was visible since we had just walked out side?;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
Two very bright red objects travelling with missile-like speed across the entire night sky NNW to SSE;2011-07-03 22:50:00;2 minutes X2;Two very bright red objects travelling with missile-like speed across the entire night sky NNW to SSE We were setting off fireworks and watching fireworks go off around us when a very bright red object that at first seemed like a firework rocket appeared in the NNW sky moving SSW but instead of exploding or burning out as expected it traveled across the entire sky, horizon to horizon, taking approximately two minutes to do so.   Around ten minutes later an identical object appeared from the same direction and again traveled over head and to the SSW horizon traveling the same speed and taking the same path. Best guess was that they were large military grade missiles, they were really spectacular.  Scary to two of the witnesses, they were shaken up.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
