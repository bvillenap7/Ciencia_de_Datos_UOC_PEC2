Contrail actually indicated 90 degree turn S to W to N leaving U-shaped contrail that changed to gold/fire color on northern leg The contrail showed an exact 90 degree turn each time and appeared to be at extreme altitude.  After the last turn, the contrail appeared golden in color and the object was also moving at a high rate of speed.  After the last turn, there was a U shaped contrail visible in the sky.  There was a brief interruption in the contrail on the last leg, it came back for a few seconds then disappeared.  When the object stopped making the contrail, the entire U shaped contrail disappeared leaving no trace or trail.  It was dusk but there were no clouds in the sky that may have obscured the trail, it simply disappeared.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
Bright lights not moving for 20+ min then bizarre movement.;2014-09-01 23:30:00;55 minutes;Bright lights not moving for 20+ min then bizarre movement Bright flashing green, orange and white lights approximately 282 degrees west...my kids watched it about 20 min with me then I continued watching it for about 25 more minutes. First thought it was a airplane but after 2 other different airplanes flew from about 170 degrees south past the lights and it still did not move I was curious to keep watching it.  After about 30 min, it began moving west for about 10-15 min then it started moving very strange.  First left erratically then right then it moved up and down unlike any airplane I have ever seen.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
Sequential lights seen over Caldwell/Nampa Idaho;2014-09-04 21:10:00;20 minutes;Sequential lights seen over Caldwell/Nampa Idaho I observed what I thought was a plane spraying a field at night, while I was driving towards Caldwell, ID, last night. There was an indistinct shape faintly outlined against the night sky, which I took to be a plane, that had a steady golden light on either end, where the wing tips would be. As I watched, the lights faded out completely and the object was no longer visible against the sky. It had appeared to be approaching me over the slight dips and swells of the landscape in that area. The area is devoid of trees, mountains or hills, and there are no large buildings to obstsruct the view. It struck me as odd so I began to scan the sky as well as I could and continue driving. About a minute later, I saw a golden light ahead of me, more towards the Nampa area now, which was the direction I was headed. I thought that if it were the same object it must've been moving fairly rapidly, or the light may've just not been as bright, making me think it was further away than it was. The night was completely clear with a little over a 1/4 moon, which if it was considered to be at a 12 o'clock position,! the light I was now seeing would have been about 7 o'clock. This light also dimmed until it faded from view. I was now intensely interested in what might be flying overhead. Two minutes later, I saw the light again, but this time it had either split into two objects or had been joined by another, since I could see what appeared to be two separate sets of lights. The lights now appeared quite a bit closer to me than before, much as the first ones had-and I'd estimate that to have not been over a half mile from me. There was one fairly bright golden light (I would say that it was nearly as bright as a very bright star, but not as bright as Venus appears)that remained steady, but the second object had, first one light, then as it dimmed and went out, a second one lit, and as IT dimmed and went out, a third one lit, and then it dimmed and went out, as did the single light. The 3 lights that lit and dimmed in sequence were almost verticle from my point of view, and the sequence! of lighting and dimming began at the top and ended at the bot! tom. Thi s was like nothing I'd ever seen before. Traffic was fairly heavy on I-84 so I feel someone else must've witnessed the same thing as I.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
Saw 9 red lights disappear...so scared.;2015-01-02 23:00:00;3 minutes;Saw 9 red lights disappear...so scared. Husband and his friend first saw 9 red lights gathered together and when my sister in law and I came out, we saw two.  They disappeared like candles being blown out.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
Standing in the driveway, looking up towards the moon, which is to the WNW, I saw a orange glowing, moving light.;2015-09-20 22:35:00;3.5 minutes;While standing in the driveway looking up towards the moon which is to the west north west, I saw a orange glowing ,moving light that was clearly in a turn. I had to walk forward to continue watching, with nothing to obscure my view.  Whatever it was, was moving at a great rate of speed. Then what I was watching just disappear from the sky;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
Inconsistent flashing and swerving object overhead;2020-09-17 22:15:00;1 minutes;Inconsistent flashing and swerving object overhead Traveled west to East apx 80 degrees high.  First noticed 2-3 bright flashes within 3 sec.  continued to travel East with bright flashes occurring every 5-10 sec. object would swerve left and right as it traveled East.  After a minute, it disappeared. At first we thought it was a meteorite entering atmosphere due to brightness but when it began to swerve, we knew it was not a meteorite. It appeared too high to be a helicopter and the flashes were too inconsistent and too bright to be aircraft strobes.  This was witnessed by 2 career pilots and their spouses.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
