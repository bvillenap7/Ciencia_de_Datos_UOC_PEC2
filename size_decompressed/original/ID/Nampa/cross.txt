Did anybody else see what looked like a small engine aircraft flying through the night sky ON FIRE in Nampa last night?  I am shocked I did not hear anything on the news about this! It was flying northwest to south east mainly heading south.  It was fairly low flying. like helicopter height.  I can't believe no one else is talking about this! I know this is a UFO sight, and I was convinced it was a burning airplane because it looked to be engulfed in flames.  Nothing like the blinking lights of normal aircraft.  Anyways, if you have heard anything, I'd like to hear about it.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
