Bright white circle shines through clouds and moves west for several minutes before dissapearing.;2013-02-28 07:30:00;3-4 minutes;Bright white circle shines through clouds and moves west for several minutes before dissapearing. 7:30 am    I just dropped my son off  at the back gate to school as he was running a little late. Traveling West on E.Park Ridge I observed out my left window what looked like the sun or moon behind the clouds. I know the sun was just rising in the East and this seemed to be moving.  So I stopoed the truck to check. It was moving West. I began driving home keeping it view 95% of the way.   When I got home and got out of the truck I could still see it,..now it was still moving in a general West direction behind the trees in front of my house and just disappeared.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187

Shiny daytime ufo over nampa idaho 08/06/2016;2016-08-06 20:45:00;1 hour;Shiny daytime ufo over nampa idaho 08/06/2016 Well before dark but after sundown a bright light appeared almost directly overhead.  It was smallish and circular only a few degrees SE from directly overhead.  It was the size of Jupiter, as seen at night lately.  The person who pointed it out to me asked me what it was, so I grabbed a pair of binoculars and braced against the swingset and had a much better look at the anomaly.   In the binoculars it was still quite small but I could see a much higher level of detail.  It was perfectly circular with what appeared to be an indentation in the center and a horizontal darker patch running across the circle.   I grabbed my hunting rifle to see it at a higher magnification and could see a much more detailed view.  It appeared to be a plate shaped disk with two proportionately large tubular curved pieces above and below the darker horizontal line which now with the higher magnification seemed to be some type of structure running across the center indentation.  I called my neighbor and he stepped out and looked at it for a while with my rifle and then he went in and got one of his own and continued looking at it.   At this point, I called kivi a local tv station and told them about what I was looking at and asked if they would point a camera at it.  The gentleman who took my call said he had been e-mailed about it just before I called.  The three of us watched it until around an hour had passed when it started to get dimmer to the point where it was very hard to see with the naked eye.  Through my scope, I continued to watch it as it got a deep shade of red which I attributed to the sun setting on it.  It didn't appear to travel linearly but seemed to be going upward slowly.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
Rotating circular object with antennae.;2016-08-08 17:30:00;>1 hour;Rotating circular object with antennae On August 8th, around 17:30MT, I glanced up towards the tops of our popular trees and noticed, what I thought to be a small white ball of spider web hanging from the trees, suspended by the strong breeze, until I realized it was not moving, as it should have been, since the trees were.  I could not determine what it was I was looking at-it was simply a very small white dot against the bright blue, sunlit sky. I brought out binoculars and thru them could tell that this mystery dot was an object much farther away than the tops of the trees.  But even through binoculars it was still just an odd white circle.  I then brought out my 8-inch telescope and for the first time in my life a “mystery object” stayed exactly where it was while I sighted in on it instead of disappearing to let me ponder what I’d seen.  When I popped in my 40mm eyepiece, I was shocked at the view. It was like nothing I’d seen before.  The object looked like the protective grille of a fan, with highly reflective, or independently lit spines, radiating outward in an arc.  Inside the fan grille shape was what looked like a bowl tipped sideways.  Protruding from where one end of the bowl met the grille, there appeared to be antennae of some sort. As I watched I became aware that this object was slowly rotating, placing the antennae away from me so I could not see it, and then bringing it back into my view.  As it rotated, it also presented me a view that brightly reflected an “S” shape within the grille.  It also started to slowly move across my field of view in the eyepiece but I was easily able to follow it. I called my aunt in Boise, who lives near the foothills on the northeast side of town, and asked her to try to spot this thing, and she was able to immediately, but there were a few thin clouds over her area, clouds that were extremely low on the horizon for me as I faced northeast, watching this object continue to rotate and pick up a small amount of forward speed.  It was still visible, though growing smaller and appeared to slow its rotation when I quit watching…  Thankfully I’d snapped several fairly detailed pictures with my cell phone and then with a digital camera, by holding both, individually, up to the eyepiece of my telescope. I even took a few video clips that are of decent quality. I was so excited to see this object that as soon as I had sighted in on it and realized it was not something common, I called your hotline and made a brief report while the sighting was occurring. Last night, my aunt and I tried to identify what we might have seen, trying to debunk our own sighting, but we could not. The closest thing we could compare this odd object to was a Loon Balloon, but both of us agree that was not what we had seen.  Our object was stationary for quite a long time overhead when I first noticed it, but rotating very slowly and the appendage that appeared to be antennae was solidly affixed so that it was able to be suspended horizontally as the rotation continued, and did not hang from below.  When it began to move it was following a fixed path in the sky,  It appeared to be controlled in some intelligent way, until it reached an area northeast of Boise then it began to shift more to the north. What is also of extreme interest is that the pictures my aunt took with her phone depict more than one object-or this same object was able to change its shape-not something I had been aware of but I had taken my eyes off it several times...  But I will let her share that part of the story within her own report.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
I saw 2 orange lights.  At first I thought it was a plane till one light went in front of the other.  ((anonymous report));2017-02-24 22:15:00;10 seconds;Was in the car when I saw 2 orange lights.  At first I thought it was a plane till one light went in front of the other, this alternated between the two lights, one would go in front of the other.  Then both light disappeared without a trace (while, I was looking at them, the lights never got smaller they just disappeared).   Got out of my car and told my sister what I saw she said she saw the same thing.  Still not sure what happened and how it just disappeared in the sky.
