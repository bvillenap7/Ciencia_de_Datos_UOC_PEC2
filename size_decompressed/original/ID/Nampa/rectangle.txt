Huge object moving really fast but not to fast or slow and just disappeared.  ((NUFORC Note:  Re-entering Chinese rocket.

It was moving across the sky at a high speed but not as fast as meteor but not as slow as a Military Jet.  Their was a dust cloud behind it and it had a little bit of white light.  It was going Faster and Faster and lower and lower then it was gone just like that.  It was huge like giant.  It reminded me of the ships off the avengers the marvel movie.
