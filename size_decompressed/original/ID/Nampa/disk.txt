((HOAX??))  Close sighting UFO;2001-08-07 23:00:00;30 sec.;Close sighting UFO Well, it was a late Augest night and i just got done eating dinner so i passed out for the night. A couple hours later i awoke to go use the restroom. I'm standing there over the toilet doing my buisness,tierd from a long day and thats when something happened. I don't know what happened it was like i was tierd and then in less than a split second i was awake.I dont want to come to assumptions but it was like i got scanned or my mind knew something was up that i was not aware of. That instant I knew what ever it was it was outside my window. I opened the blinds and there was a flatened, round, oval shape was just hovering there 3 feet from my face. It was about 2 feet long and 4 inch's tall and was completly black and silent. The object hovered there for about 5 second's and slowly moved upward over my house making the wierdest noise ive ever heard in my life. it was a low pitched woo,woo,woo,...... I then ran out my front door to see it take off but nothing was there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Oct 25 2013 approximately 20:30 hrs.  Bright star appearing light low on the horizon (not seen in the past) observed on and off for .45;2013-10-25 20:30:00;.45 minutes;Oct 25 2013 approximately 20:30 hrs.  Bright star appearing light low on the horizon (not seen in the past) observed on and off for .45 min period.  During my observation period the object very slowly moved in a westerly direction.  During my last break the light was gone.  It was difficult to determine but I believe that I observed this same light south westerly over the Owyhee Mountains. Oct 26 2013 Approximately 20:15 hrs.  The same bright object has appeared once again.  With a slight variation of location, as observed through the same phone lines.  That night I found my Simmons 10 x50 binoculars and observed the object.  Through the binoculars the bright light appeared to be not round but radar receiver shape quite bright with a slight wobble.    Not sure of my observation because of the appearance of lines extending across the surface of the object.   The thought occurred to me that perhaps it was a space observation object.   I went in the house and referred to my Night Watch by Terence Dickinson Perhaps the light that I was observing was in fact a celestial object and I was NUTS. Today is the Oct 27, 2013.  I will be watching again but donâ€™t know who to contact for verifying my observations.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
Disk/saucer in Nampa, Idaho.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probable sighting of Venus, we suspect.  PD));2017-02-21 21:00:00;40 minutes;Disk/Saucer in Nampa, Idaho. We were observing our back yard as we had seen a hovering orb for around a half hour sitting there.  We then made the choice to try to trace it's where about and drove, then gathering multiple photographs that were very incriminating and show the clear body of the craft as well as a sort of beam coming out of the bottom. The object also seemed to have hovered above a house for a brief period of time however we did not see if an abduction happened as we were a bit away and without the phone, it looked like a very bright orb.  A few times it would move extremely fast and then seem to vanish.  Only to show up again 10 minutes later.  The photos captured were very clear when zoomed in and show the craft almost completely clearly.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
