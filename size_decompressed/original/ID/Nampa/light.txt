Just west of Nampa, ID.  Bright white light moves away rapidly.;2002-07-15 22:30:00;5 sec;Just west of Nampa, ID.  Bright white light moves away rapidly. Walking north down my driveway when I saw something out of the corner of my eye.  I looked in a NNE direction and saw a bright white light at about 60 degrees above the horizon. Perfectly still and about the size of 1/4 full moon. In approx. 2 seconds it began to move away from me at a constant high rate of speed. Within 5 seconds it had gone to a pinpoint and disappeared.  They way it got smaller without shifting position above the horizon, it seemed to be moving directly away from me. The light had an odd creamy texture to it. Silent and very smooth movement, like a lighted aperture closing as it disappeared. Could not be mistaken for anything natural.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
bright light moving rapidly accross the sky, stops then accelerates at a 90 degree angle;2008-03-22 00:25:00;5 seconds;bright light moving rapidly accross the sky, stops then accelerates at a 90 degree angle My son and I were in our living room which faces to the East. A light moving from the South to the North caught our eye through the upper windows of the room.  It was 5 or 6 times larger, and 7 or 8 times brighter than the North Star. It moved approx. 70 degrees in a flat trajectory in about a second and a half, stopped for about a second, and moved out of sight to the East in about 2 seconds. The deceleration and acceleration were both instantaneous. Altitude is hard to estimate, as we did not see it relative to the ground.  About 4 or 5 minutes later a similar light moved across the windows from West to East, in the same direction as the first light moved after it stopped. It seemed to be moving  at the same speed as the first light and was gone in about 2.5 seconds.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
Interesting light in sky, definitely space-object, behaved like satellite, but was momentarily very, very bright;2009-01-28 18:00:00;Approx. 100 seconds;Interesting light in sky, definitely space-object, behaved like satellite, but was momentarily very, very bright It was right around 6PM local time, Sun had barely set, and I was standing in my backyard enjoying a cigarette. Was not looking at sky but eyes drawn to sky by radiant light suddenly appearing in the sky. It was as bright as an airliner's landing lights, when viewed about ~2000 feet above and ~2000 feet away from you, aimed in your direction. The light suddenly and rapidly dimmed into the very low apparent brightness of a satellite, and it cruised at satellite speeds directly overhead towards the southeast. I'd say when I initially saw it - when it was really bright - it was about fifty degrees of arc above the eastern horizon. I'd normally think it was a satellite. Speed was right, direction was right, and it crossed in my vision with the Sun below the horizon, and could have hit the satellite at just the right angle to make it very bright. But this thing was BRIGHT. It would have been a massive satellite to glare like that from so far away. I watch the ISS sometimes - actually look where it is on the internet and plan for it to fly over me in that very type of lighting situation - and it wasn't the ISS. In that lighting situation ISS does not get as bright, and then does not get so dim, as this thing did. The other odd aspect of this thing's illumination was it did not ever get totally dark when it crossed the terminator heading to the southeastern horizon. When I've observed the ISS in the same situation, it rapidly turns a gorgeous red and then fades into black at some point before crossing the other horizon. The ISS is spectacular when it does that. This thing did not disappear when it crossed the terminator. It was a very interesting phenomena.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
3 second green flaming ball of light over our heads on beach.;2012-08-26 00:00:00;3 seconds;3 sec green flaming ball of light over our heads on beach. We were all sitting out on the beach at around midnight, when this green flaming ball of light came and flashed over our heads and down into the trees.  It  flew down from the south end of the sky, to the north into the trees.  We had no idea what it was.  It was this green very large ball of flaming green fire.

I got out of the car and was checking the doors to the church when I looked up and a bright red light was hovering in the sky.   No flashing lights and no sound.  It hovered for about a minute and then slowly went up until it disappeared.   Never reappeared.   Nobody else to my knowledge saw it.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187

Southwest of Nampa, low flying, red light flying/flashing upwards then turned green flew side to side, light got bigger then turned blue and dropped down fast.  A few seconds later it did the same thing.  First red flying upwards, green side to side very fast, then bigger and brighter blue swooping down at an abnormal aircraft speed.  Lasted about 30 seconds and was not seen again.  Very strange sighting and anomaly.  Never seen anything like it.  One of us tried to video record it on our mobile device but only captured the lights around the houses and in houses.  So strange.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
Driving through Nampa's old highway off of 12th ave heading to Eagle strange orb.;2013-11-25 19:00:00;1 minute;Driving through Nampa's old highway off of 12th ave heading to Eagle strange orb This event lasted about 1 minute or less.  I was driving with my friend and she was in the passenger seat.  Something compelled me to look over to the right side of the old Highway heading into Eagle and we where entering ADA county. I saw a very strange light behind some roadside trees in-front of some old farm houses in a field, but the orb of light  was at a low point in the sky (EST. 150-200 FT in the air) above the trees and houses. As I was driving I pointed it quickly out to my passenger.  Not even a moment later we drove through an area that that had the roadside trees block the view of it on that side of the road. Remember this all happened very fast.  When I could see the field it was above again, it had disappeared completely. This really spooked us kids out and we both confirmed seeing it!  Wonder if it some government new space age stuff or if it really is from the beyond. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Bright red lights in the sky moving from west to east then fading away.;2014-07-04 22:45:00;5;Bright red lights in the sky moving from west to east then fading away My wife and I were watching the fireworks from our second story roof top. My wife first saw a red steady light out in the distance to the north.  I thought it was a helicopter taking photos of the fireworks in the area as it seemed to stop and hover in one location in the sky then move around.  Did this a couple of times and it seem to just get faint in brightness and it vanished.  No more than 8 minutes or so later two bright red lights were slowly traveling from west to east overhead side by side in formation. One slowed some but stayed up with the other.  This lasted for three or so minutes overhead then they changed direction toward the northeast and faded into nothing.  No sound as I tried hard to listen, nothing. Weather - High clouds, no open sky of stars and good visibility.  Faint light from the setting sun in the west. Winds around 5-6 mph.  I'm a 20 so year pilot so I know what helicopters and fixed wing look and perform like.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
Red light follows orange light silently, then accelerate away in different directions.;2015-07-05 22:14:00;2 minutes;Red light follows orange light silently, then accelerate away in different directions. About 25Â° above the horizon, I watched an orange light followed by a red light travel from south to north. They initially travelled below the clouds, but were silent and appeared to irregularly pulsate in brightness. I estimate their altitude to be 8,000-15,000' and I cannot speculate as to their speed, except that seemed to be flying slightly faster than an airplane typically would at that altitude. both lights appeared to be on the same course and traveling at the same speed. After about 1.5 minutes of observation, the leading orange light ascended into the clouds and was lost to me. The second light, red in color, seemed to change course, heading due west, and progressively accelerated as it changed direction, eventually also disappearing behind the clouds some 60 seconds after I had lost the orange light.  As it was just after dusk, I could discern no features of the crafts, but the lights appeared to be the size of the craft, and were circular. In comparison, aircraft navigation lights appear as points of light, and these lights had a discernible diameter which I lack expertise necessary to calculate.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187

Yellowish light moving through early morning sky - no sound, no strobes;2016-07-27 05:10:00;5+ minutes;Yellowish light moving through early morning sky - no sound, no strobes While out for my morning walk around the neighborhood I noticed a light moving through the sky from northwest to southeast.  It was a bright light, yellowish in color and brighter than any of the stars I could see in the sky at the time.  It reminded me of Mars but larger and brighter. The light was a constant color and did not have any pulsation or change color throughout my observation of it.  At first I thought it might be an airplane with its landing lights on heading into the Boise airport about 20 miles east of me but as it went overhead there was no sound and no strobes usually seen on airplanes.   After it passed me, I could still see the same color and intensity of the light even though I was now behind it.  I could not tell its altitude or even guess at it.  It looked like a super bright yellowish star moving through the sky.   I lost sight of it behind some trees but then after clearing the trees spotted it again farther southeast of me.  Then it brightened slightly and then faded and disappeared.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
Orange light in the sky over Nampa;2020-02-01 20:52:00;1 minute;Orange light in the sky over Nampa As my husband and I were headed toward home this evening, we were driving south, on a lane that is straight south of I84, in Nampa, ID. I noticed, in the southeastern sky, a fairly bright, fairly large orange light moving at the same rate of speed a small airplane would fly. We were driving northeast of the small Nampa Airport and when I first noticed the light I thought it was most likely a small plane, except for the color of the light which seemed odd. I pointed it out to my husband and I asked, what is that? We then realized it could not be an actual airplane because it only had a single, steady light on it, and that light was very orange orange and bright, like a glowing barbecue coal.  We pulled over and watched as it flew across in front of us, below the Moon, heading NW, and I then looked out my window toward the west and watched it...when it got directly across from us it seemed that I could see some sort of squarish structure or hazy ar! ea?? below it but the structure was so faint I couldn't tell what I was seeing. I rolled my window down and my husband opened the cars sunroof and we could hear absolutely no sound from this object. It then  promptly dimmed and went out. I can't be sure if it actually dimmed or if it went into a slight cloud cover in the NW sky. We continued home, which was less than a quarter of a mile away, and when we got in the house I looked at our weather station to see which direction the wind was blowing and the wind was SSW 5, which meant this was not something that was blowing in the wind because if it had been it should have been flying to the Northeast and not the northwest. And it definitely seemed to be self propelled, by the steady rate of speed it appeared to have. We watched it for a total of about a minute before it dimmed and disappeared.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187

Other witness looked up and and said those lights are moving. There was no noise at all and they just kept coming one after the other after the other not always in a perfect line or order sometimes two at a time side by side and they just kept coming they weren't moving particularly fast they were not flashing lights lights and a couple of times I noticed that some of them were going the opposite way and one time it looked like the circled around then after about 15 minutes they were gone. Only at one time did I see them all in a line but then that changed and then they were just all gone a couple of times it actually looked like they were slowing down almost at a standstill right over the top of where we were in Nampa Idaho very strange;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187

We are directly west (approximately 20 miles) of the airport in Boise and we see aircraft all the time. I'm very familiar with the patterns that they take, when they take off from Boise and when they land.... We are also near the small airport in Nampa, and we see the smaller craft and have always noticed those flight patterns as well. I stood there a moment and noticed what I thought was a plane coming toward me from directly east headed straight west. I was immediately struck by the thought that I had never seen a plane come straight west that way before and I have lived here several years. That's what caught my attention first. The light pattern was different than I had ever seen before, and as an astronomy enthusiast I am always looking up, and I am always looking at planes. These lights were very golden yellow, very muted....it made me think of an old cars six volt lighting system. The lights were steady and there were many of them. They spanned the width of my index and middle finger held at arm's length against the night sky. I had nothing for reference so I really don't know how far away it was but it didn't seem to be that far, but perhaps that was because I expected it to be a small craft. There were two main lights, like a cars head lights, which were larger than the rest,  and three flanking ea! ch of those to the left and right, and two small ones between the two larger and a row of smaller lights directly beneath the two larger lights. All the lights were aligned horizontally. I watched it for a moment as it was coming toward me at a even rate of speed, not very fast, which made me think it must be a small airplane, but I believe it was also fairly low, coming across the fields from the direction of Boise. I came in the house and I got my phone and clicked on Flight Radar and while it loaded I watched this craft approaching at a steady rate of speed. I heard no noise, there were no flashing lights, only the golden yellow pattern of lights. I walked out to the front deck to call the cat and expected this plane to go over my head, despite  never showing up on Flight Radar, but there have been planes that don't show up on the app for whatever reasons, but I still should have been able to see and hear it by now. I don't even think 30 seconds passed from the time I we! nt from the back door, through the house to the front. I waite! d and no thing passed overhead. I walked out into the driveway and looked in every direction and still I saw nothing, heard nothing. The craft seemed to have completely disappeared. Flight Radar still showed no aircraft near me, other then a commercial flight headed Northwest at 30000+ feet.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
