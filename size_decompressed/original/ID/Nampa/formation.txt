I was smoking and bsing with my good friends when we noticed what seemed to be an aircraft with its high beems pointed at us. It then made and obviouse curve and turned into 3 reeectangular lights that made a small line. Imediately after it turned again, it was a single blinking light. We watched it for another half minute or so, when we noticed that its speed was accelerating. Then out of nowhere, it has lights that swirl around it similar to an atom and its electrons. At the same this was happening, we were being approached by several airplane sounding crafts that had blue and red lights. One of the ufo's flew directly above us, and we could see triangular light patterns on the bottom of the craft. There were approximately 15 of these in a line flying NNE. After we thought all this excitement was over, not even five minutes later did a Military Jet fighter start zooming through the sky, like it was chasing them, It did a few curves and even broke the sound barrier. My smoke and light seemed over, so we all stepped inside. 1 minute later, a huge flash of light lit up the back window, so we checked and there was that same flying thing that we saw at the start, and this time it wasnt flying in a straight line, it zigzaged slightly. Shortly after, i got very pale and sick, i dont know why, maybee the chicken.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
3 Lights Transforms To 4 flying In Triangle & Diamond.;2018-03-28 22:05:00;2 minutes;3 Lights Transforms To 4 flying In Triangle & Diamond. I take the trash out every other night right around 10 pm when I get off work.  As I do this, I always observe the skies.   Tonight, I saw first 3 lights flying in a pyramid shape, with a 4th popping out of nowhere about 20 seconds in.  The formation was pretty high in the sky flying SW to NE.  When I first noticed them, I popped my head in the front door and yelled at my wife to come fast.  She witnessed about the last minute or so.   The lights were almost transforming as they flew at very fast speeds.  As It was moving it changed from a triangle to a sqaure then to a diamond.  As we watched it fly it seemed to just disappear into thin air.   I tried to pull my phone out to record but the light from it kind of blinded me and I couldn't find it before it disappeared.  This was unlike anything we have ever seen in our lives.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
