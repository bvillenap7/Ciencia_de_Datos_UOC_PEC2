The orb was about 15 in diameter.  At that time my radio and head lights and other electronics on my car started to act funny (radio stopped working, head lights and dash lights started to blink out) When I saw it after going going down the hill it was about 30 feet in front of me hovering about 3 feet over the road in front of me (it was about 30 feet in front of me, when I first saw it, but I put my car in nuetral and coasted up to it within a few feet).  It then emitted a very bright green light that encompassed my car and then disappeared in a bright flash, the next thing I know is that I am pulling into my driveway in Meridian and it was 11:00pm in the night.  I immediatly called my mom and asked what time it was and she said it was 11:00pm.  It only takes about 25 minutes to reach Meridian from Nampa but yet it took me alomost 30 minutes longer.  I cannot explain what happened to me that night but I know what I saw was real. I would like to add that this is not an April Fools joke, this was a long time ago and I do not remeber the exact date, I just remeber that this was in April.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
Orange Orbs In Formation.  Two Sightings (Jul 4th/Jul 17th);2014-07-17 23:30:00;30+ minutes;Orange Orbs In Formation. Two Sightings (Jul 4th/Jul 17th) Sighting 1) July 4th, 2014, (22:45mt)   At aprox 22:45 we were enjoying the neighborhood fireworks.  When I noticed what looked like orange street lamp colored sparks, from an aerial mortar type firework drifting in the wind.  It quickly became apparent they were actually flying objects. One flew by, followed by two in perfect formation.  They were traveling in an Easterly direction, rather slowly.  I turned and asked the other adults if they were seeing the same thing, all agreed they did.  As minutes past it hit me we should be taking video.  We were able to get a short video, but the orbs were too far away by that time, and it barely showed up. The orbs were visible for close to five minutes, then faded out one by one.  They were very bright streetlight orange at first, then faded with distance.  But also faded in and out randomly.  They made zero noise, and had no other navigational type lights. Sighting 2)  July 17th, 2014, (23:30mt)   At aprox. 11:30pm while. driving South on Happy Valley Rd and Amity roundabout, noticed three bright very clear orange orbs over the S East horizon.  The orbs were flying in perfectly spaced formation.  As we came down the small hill, a fourth and fifth appeared in the formation. We followed them East Then South on Greenhurst/Black Cat about 5 miles.  We then turned west on Kuna Rd and pulled to the shoulder as the Orbs very slowly descended towards ground level.  I was able to shoot a small amount of video.  We drove a few miles West then South, but lost the orbs among the yard lights in the distance.  Driving home with windows down, we noticed a heavy burnt electrical smell in the air. We absolutely have no doubt both sightingswere the same type of object.  I have an above average knowledge of civil/mil aviation, and can say these were not aircraft, balloons, or lanterns.  Nor were they afterburners or flares from local mil fighters.  With no navigational lights, or noise associated with most aircraft. And though these appear similar to yard/street lights.  Being brighter, well above the horizon, and moving!  Can not be same.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
Witness bright sphere traveling over the nortwest skies of Idaho.;2016-04-20 13:00:00;30 minutes;Witness bright sphere traveling over the nortwest skies of Idaho. Witnessed a UFO sphere in the northern skies, moving toward the northwest.  It was during a bright sunny day, about 1:00 PM in the afternoon. The object took on the look of a shinning star as it moved across the sky.  At times it would stay stationary, and then move slowly across the sky in the same direction, until it was barely visible to the naked eye.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187

No lights at all. There was no sound. It was large enough to be noticed cutting its own path against the night sky. It disappeared in under a min, prob about 30 sec. A shooting star did streak across the sky about 10-15 mins after the object appeared and departed the area.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
