Bright multi colored orbs/UFO'S.;2012-11-10 05:39:00;still seeing them;bright multi colored orbs/UFO'S. We are looking at them as i write this they are fairly low in the sky and are what we would describe as bright multi colored orbs.  That change shape as well as color.   We have been observing these UFO's for over a month now and this is the second encounter where they have been sitting this low in the sky.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
The thing that caught my attention was that they each attached themselves to each other and detached.;2015-07-08 01:00:00;20 minutes;My friends and I witnessed 3 different flying objects/lights over Lake Lowell in Nampa, Idaho, last night.  They were saucer shaped with altering lights (changed colors and brightness simultaneously) and would never tilt even when change of direction (up down side to side).  The object beamed VERY BRIGHT lights down towards the ground.  It would disappear also but when it lit up is when you could see the definite saucer shape.  They would fly abnormally over the lake and when they got closer to us there was a whirring or humming sound that was present.  The thing that caught my attention was that they each attached themselves to each other and detached.;43.5643906403941;-116.559663054187
