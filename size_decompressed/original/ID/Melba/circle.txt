Bright orange orbs.;2017-05-15 19:00:00;1 minute;bright orange orbs Was driving home to Melba, when I saw a bright orange orb on my left,  I thought it was a plane at first, perhaps, and then it was gone, which I found odd.  Suddenly, out of nowhere, there was an orange orb to my far right.  It disappeared after a few seconds, then three orange orbs popped up to my left and then they disappeared.
