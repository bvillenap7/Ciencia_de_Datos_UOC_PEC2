Two people observed a stationary oval object in the southwestern sky above the Owyhee mountains. We observed the light at 9:29 p.m. Until 9:47 p.m. viewing it thru a spotting scope.  It was oval in shape with yellow lights on each end with red, blue and green lights pulsating intermittently between the yellow lights on each end.  No sound was heard.  It moved away from us and disappeared instantly.  We viewed this object from a location that is sparsely populated and the lights on the ground were from the few homes in the area. There is an Idaho Power substation located very close to the spot where the object hovered.  The sky was very dark with high clouds and no stars were seen.  The moon would have been to the North with sighting to the Southwest. We are retired business owners in our 70's.
