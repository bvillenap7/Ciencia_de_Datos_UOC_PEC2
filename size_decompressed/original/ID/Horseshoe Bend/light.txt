Strange bright pulsing light over Horseshoe Bend.;2018-07-28 23:10:00;20 seconds;Strange bright pulsing light over Horseshoe Bend While relaxing after paragliding at Horseshoe Bend Flight Park we were in a circle sitting and chatting while enjoying the the night.  This is culmination of initial witnesses, and later witnesses. The first 2 people were looking up at the stars and see a small but bright light (approx 1/4 the brightness of the moon) very high in the atmosphere.  It was reported to be weaving slowly through the sky.  It extended a short beam of light out and would then trace this line to its next location.  These motions were small and no more than 1 degree across the night sky.   At this time me and the other 6 people looked up to observe the object.  The beam turned off but continued to pulse brightly while making a slow right turn from south to the west. Pulsing about 4 times more before it disappeared.  About the time we became vocal about what we were witnessing it disappeared.   I am very familiar with drones, the ISS, aircraft,  satellites as well as any other objects and how they look in the night sky.  I am also well versed in astronomy.  This was absolutely unusual.  What it is, I have no idea but it was nothing close to anything I have ever seen.;43.9259;-116.1839
