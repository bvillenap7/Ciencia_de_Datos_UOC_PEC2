Green Oval Shaped UFO Sighted Near Gowen Air Field US Air Force Base Boise Idaho;2004-08-22 01:00:00;30 seconds?;Green Oval Shaped UFO Sighted Near Gowen Air Field US Air Force Base Boise Idaho During August 2004 at approximately 01:00 hours in the morning, myself and a passenger were traveling South toward the hills on Federal Way in Boise Idaho near a large power station and some small subdivisions and near Gowen Air Field US Air Force Base only a few miles west, there was no traffic and the sky was clear and the temperature was around 80 degrees Fahrenheit. As we traveled on the desolate highway South, a bright green light went over us, very low to the ground and at a high rate of speed moving south above the highway illuminating the area around us for a moment. We were very startled and I inadvertently drove off the road and stopped the car, yelling WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT! over and over. I reached under my coat and took a hold of my 1911 pistol instinctively and then thought, “Yeah right”. As for the object itself, it was very large and oval shaped and simply glowed green and was very low to the ground making no sound and moved at a high rate of speed disappearing over the hills to the south. And for the rest of the evening we were both perplexed by what we could not explain and which scared the hell out of us. I reported it to the US Air Force whom I believe thought that I was making it all up. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

Amber light hoovering in the west sky;2011-03-19 22:30:00;3-4 minutes;Amber light hoovering in the west sky When getting home around 10:30 on Saturday night, we looked up at the sky to the west and noticed an amber light hoovering in the sky.  We watched it for a few minutes while it moved in the sky, up, down, and side to side.  There were no flashing lights, no sound and it was pretty bright, about the size of a street light from a block away.  After a few minutes, it started to move away from us and within 30 seconds or so at the most it was gone.  It moved away toward the northwest and went up.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
multi-color flashing lights with bright white in the middle. Hovering with no noise every night.  ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius?  PD));2011-09-26 21:30:00;hour;multi-color flashing lights with bright white in the middle. Hovering over Boise with no noise every night we have noticed this aircraft every night now for the last 4 nights.  It appears around 9 to 10 pm and we also see it very early in the morning around 6 am.  It has many lights surrounding a bright white middle one.  The bright white middle one stays lit, while the others around it are red, blue, orange, yellow, and we think green.  It looks like a flying Christmas tree.  Here's the strange part.  It just stays hovering in one spot for at least an hour. There is no noise.  I have never seen anything like it or act like it.  It's too low to be a satelite.  Definitely not a plane.  I guess it could be a helicopter, but what helicopter hovers every night in the same spot, for hours, and in the morning with those weird lights?  I can't believe nobody else has reported it or maybe they have and we just don't know about it.  I guarantee you it will be out again tonight. ((NUFORC Note:  Sirius?

Sun colored shape with red ring see over Boise, ID.;2012-11-21 01:30:00;10 minutes;Sun colored shape with red ring see over Boise, ID A bright sun colored oblong shape with a bright red ring around it moving East to West over the area of Cole Rd between Fairview & Ustick.  I was silent and slow moving flying seemingly lower than an airplane but higher than a helicopter.  It then took a sweeping wide turn and began heading North until it disappeared into the night sky.  No reports were in the local news about this. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides little contact information.

As I parked my car I happen to look up towards boise from the west looking east and saw two UFO traveling from E to W approaching.;2015-06-22 20:15:00;1 minute;As i parked my car i happen to look up towards boise from the west looking east and saw two UFO traveling from east to west approaching boise at a relative high attitude - I had seen and reported these two UFO a few months back - they were round or oval with a white haze and each had two red lights in the body of the haze.   I ran in my house and grabbed my binoculars and went back outside - the lead UFO had now turned south and was accenting and becoming smaller and smaller then then vanished - it was a clear nite - the 2nd UfO followed the first and the vanished a few seconds later.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Unkown object hovers in sky above prison complex.  ((anonymous report));2016-07-15 20:30:00;2 hours;Unkown object hovers in sky above prison complex. On 7/16/2016, at approximately 2030 hours, an object was observed above the South Boise Correctional Complex.  This object was silver and oval shaped.  It stayed in the same place in the sky for approximately an hour and a half.  It was seen by almost all the staff and some of the inmates at the prison. The next day a man wandered out of the desert, stating he'd been lost in the desert for three days.  This mysterious man was whisked away by local law enforcement.

Unknown orb observed for 4 hours.;2018-07-19 17:30:00;4 hours;Unknown orb observed for 4 hours July 19, 2018,  Footage of unidentified anomaly in the sky, visible for over 4 hours.  From about 5:30 to 9:30pm in broad daylight to after sunset.  Viewed from multiple locations several miles apart.  Watched it for about 3 hours (could see it while driving at freeway speeds, and our perspective to it made it appear quite far/high) before we could get to our cameras, then filmed and photographed for about 30 min at one location, moved to another location with a high viewpoint and was still visible for about 15 minutes.  We pointed it out to several people and nearly 12-15 saw it as well. Its apparent path was west mostly against wind direction from 320 at 13mph at the time.  It also didn't appear to follow the rotation of the earth thus the sun's path.  Appeared to hold altitude as the sun was setting, and its diameter appeared to decrease significantly from initial sighting to last sight.  I was able to borrow some small low magnification binoculars and look at it after about the first hour of observing it. At any rate, the video certainly speaks for its motion shape and look.  I included some comparison photos of the Moon, Jupiter, and a distant aircraft taken with the same lens and camera.  We discovered another video posted from eastern Idaho of what was clearly the same object, can provide a link. Here is the link to the video we made.  https://youtu.be/S-UKYgoZbxo;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
