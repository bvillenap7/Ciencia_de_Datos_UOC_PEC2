I got to the far end of the trail and noticed a craft with a bright yellow light near the edge of Shaw Mountain it was motionless for a few minutes and then began following the Boise ridge as it cruised slowly with no sound.   As it passed in front of me I noticed a red light in back and green light in front and it was fairly low in the sky.  It went out of sight and another identical craft came by but this one had bright white light on one side. I've seen some interesting things in the area in the last ten years but this is the first time Ive ever reported it.

I look out the window and see some sort of two part black floating object.  I say it was a cylinder shape because the two main compartments were cylindrical in shape as well as rod connecting the two parts.  There also appeared to be a horizontal laying rod shape on top.  The top compartment was bigger than the bottom.   I  saw no lights or coloring on object.  Felt like I was looking at some sort of engine part that was solid black floating in the sky.   I originally thought it was a drone as my neighbor has one and i see it often.  I thought the horizontal rod was a blade but realized it wasn't spinning.  I ran out the front door two seconds after it left my view from the window it was gone.  It also occurred to me that if it were one of the neighbors drones it would have been out of their eyesight and would not have flown it that far.  I looked out the back window across the horse pasture where said neighbors would have been flying the drone from they were not there.  Nor could the drone flown fast enough to completely vanish from sight after a two second gap.  Nor did I hear any sounds that usually accompanies a drone.  I have no idea on the real size of the thing based on the fact that I have no idea how far away it was.   It was against the gray cloudy sky and did not pass any objects that could have given me a rough guess on size.  It was definitely odd shaped and fast moving.  I would not have been able to have been quick enough to take a picture if i had my phone camera on and with me, it was only there for a few seconds.  Not sure what it could have been but after some research into drones have concluded that no one has made a drone of that shape as of yet.  I went back inside after looking at the sky for a minute and immediately grabbed a paper and pencil and wrote down and drew a rough sketch of what I saw.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
