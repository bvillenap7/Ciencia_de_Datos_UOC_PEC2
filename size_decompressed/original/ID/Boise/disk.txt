Saucer Shaped Craft Followed Me;1991-03-10 03:00:00;10minutes;Saucer Shaped Craft Followed Me On March 10th, 1991, I was returning home from a club in the city at approximately 3:30am.  I had gone to see some friends play in their band. I was not drinking that night, because the night before was my birthday and I had a terrible hangover, so I was not about to drink again that night.  Once a week was enough for me!  Anyway, I turned on to a road that was the last mile to my home, where the speed limit was 50mp.  About 1/4 of a mile down the road, I glanced up to the right, through my sunroof, because something caught my eye. I noticed an object moving up along side of me, at a high rate of speed & I got the feeling it was trying to catch up with me. By the time I got to my street to turn into my subdivision, it had caught up with me.  As I turned on to the street it began to stop & remained stationary above the area I needed to go to, to get to the street I lived on.  When I first spotted the object I dismissed it as an airplane, because when I glanced at i! t I noticed a red & blue light, and because it was running in the same flight path as all the other airplanes that come into the city. (But what didn't dawn on me at the time was that it was running in the opposite direction, and it was going way to fast to be an airplane.)   As I coasted to a stop, I realized it was no airplane. Upon further observation, I could see that the red light was larger and darker than an airplane's & the blue light was larger & darker as well, & they were positioned side by side.  As I sat there wondering what this thing was, I thought maybe if I turned my headlights off, I could get a better look at it.  After I turned my lights off, it turned its lights off too! I rolled my window down some and realized there was no sound coming from it. Now it had been raining that night so there were some clouds in the area, but there was enough light from the moon that I could see the shape of the object. Which appeared to be saucer shaped. As &quotwe&quot sat! there, it rose in the air a little and sat by a low hanging c! loud and then disappeared behind it. I realize now that it was waiting for me to turn my lights back on. But I was in such awe of what I was witnessing that I was dumbfounded by it. I wish there would have been someone with me at the time, or that I had turned my lights back on.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
A disc shaped object was captured on video.;1998-11-22 18:30:00;2 seconds;A disc shaped object was captured on video. On November 22, 1998 at about sunset, my wife and I were chatting and having coffee in our dining room and we noticed the beautiful colors that were starting to show up in the partially cloud cover sky.  I decided to get out the camcorder to capture it as the sun began to set even further into the horizon hoping to catch the kaleidoscope of colors. 	It took only a few moments to set the camera up on the tripod just outside the backdoor of our house and to start shooting.  I returned inside to get my cup of coffee, and coat, thinking everything would be OK leaving it running on it's own.  Well, everything did go OK, I returned and continued to let the camcorder do it's thing. 	Soon the colors began to fade and I stopped recording, removed the camcorder from the tripod and took everything back inside.  Wanting to see if the camcorder had captured the colors, I connected it to the VCR and began replaying the tape.  I was a little put off at first because the recording wasn't quite as good as I expected.  That's when it appeared and my eyes about popped out of my head.  Something came into the frame, then it appeared to change direction sharply and shot off out of the frame at a high rate of speed. A friend of ours who has knowledge of videos and computers did a video capture of that sequence of the tape.  He then made two still images from that sequence which we are sending to you.  The avi, (the video capture sequence), is rather large, but if you would like us to send it we can.  Just e-mail us at the address provided below. We would rather not release our names, street address or telephone number due to my line of work which I have also left blank, but we feel this information might be of value to you.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Golden lights formed what appeared to be windows on a large saucer shaped object in the Boise foothills area;2005-02-27 19:50:00;approximately One (1) min;Golden lights formed what appeared to be windows on a large saucer shaped object in the Boise foothills area On February 27, 2005 at approximately 1950 hours while driving on the 184 connector  downtown Boise, - it was almost dark, the road busy, - we noticed some strange lights going on and off in the Boise foothills area to the left (approximately east/northeast and either sitting ON or hovering in FRONT of the foothills).  These lights were approximately 2/3 of the way down from the Shafer Butte/Bogus Basin area and away to the northwest from that area so I know that it wasn't the lights from Bogus Basin or any vehicles on the road to/from Bogus Basin nor are there any buildings or structures of any kind in that area of the foothills.  The lights formed what appeared to be the windows or lights attached to a saucer shaped/disc type of object.  The object appeared to be of great size (approximately 100-200 meters across) since our vantage point was about 10 miles away and the object still appeared large to us. These bright golden lights would go on and off. We could watch them for a while while we kept driving, then they would just go off.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
White/red glowing object, no sound as it moved from the East end of the Boise Valley, south to the north and then dissappearing.;2006-07-18 23:20:00;15 sec.;White/red glowing object, no sound as it moved from the East end of the Boise Valley, south to the north and then dissappearing. Round, disk like shape glowing mostly white with red, flashing on the edges looking as if it were bird like. It was dark outside, yet the object was lit up.  We believe the lights were flashing in each side of the disk, as if it were wings flapping. It sounds bizzar, yet both my 14 y/o son and I both saw this- and interpreted it as such!  It was quite large, and moving swiftly, smoothly, steadily, and seemed quite high up in the sky.  No sound came from it, as it moved from the East end of the Boise Valley (by Warm Springs Ave.), south to the north and then dissappearing.  It was larger than any satellite, much larger than any stars....;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
4 white or cream disk-shaped UFOs in pairs about a minute apart over Boise, Idaho;2007-06-26 16:00:00;2-3 minutes;4 white or cream disk-shaped UFOs in pairs about a minute apart over Boise, Idaho I am a 33 year old woman who saw, along with my 3 year old daughter, two saucer-shaped white or cream colored UFOs go by, approximately at the speed of an airplane, the first two were side by side, not real close though, and the other two came about a minute later and were one behind the other. I had seen several jets flying by as well at different times but these UFOs had no wings or appendages of any kind, nor any trails behind them. Jet appeared behind them approx 3-4 minutes later.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Multiple sightings of very fast, bright, disk shaped flying things.;2010-08-24 08:00:00;2 minutes;Multiple sightings of very fast, bright, disk shaped flying things. For months now I have seen disk shaped, fast moving things.  At first I thought they must be planes or jets but they move faster than that and the whole thing is bright, like the sun is shining on it, but not. There are usually 2 at a time, with some distance between them. I usually see them over Table Rock.  I have seen them at all times of the day but usually early morning or evening.  I have never reported anything before and I suppose I could be wrong but it has happened so often and it leaves an unsettling feeling in me.  I don't know what I believe about aliens but it can't hurt to just let you know what I have seen.  Thanks.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
UFO in the sunset!!;2014-06-13 21:05:00;<1 second;UFO in the sunset!! I had just walked out of my college building and I saw a picture perfect sunset, so I got out my Apple iPad  and took two shots, they were about 3 seconds apart.( because I zoomed in a little for the second shot) I didn't think much about it until I got home, then I showed the pictures to my girlfriend and when I looked at them then, I saw something I can't explain. In the second shot I noticed just to the left of the sunset I saw a slightly blurry, metallic, football looking object up in the sky.  It looked like it was moving pretty fast and away from my position, like it was flying at the sunset.  When I enlarged the object it looked like it had a kind of haze or shimmering affect in the immediate area around the object.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

Large disk-shaped ship searching the ground, at 3 am.;2018-02-19 03:00:00;20 minutes;Large disk shaped ship searching the ground, at 3 am. I watched a very large disk shaped ship with cabin lights hovering above a neighbor's fence line several hundred feet away from our house.  It showed up well in the dark with the bright clear sky.  It was level, just hovering when I first started watching it, then it would tilt one edge down toward the ground and move back and forth slowly.  Then it would level off again.  It did this several times then went below the fence line and wasn't visible anymore.   The disk looked to be about 20 or more feet around with visible but very dim yellowish cabin lights.  The disk itself was white and looked like it had some kind of writing on it in a dark color.  The ship was S.W. of our house.  The cabin of this ship looked like a smaller disk sitting on the larger disk with the dim glowing lights around inside.  The edge that was tilted down toward the ground had a bright white beam of light. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the woman who submitted the report, and we found her to be quite sincere, and sober-minded.  We suspect she is an excellent witness.

They pointed out to me a pill shaped object in the sky.  ((NUFORC Note:  Possible high-altitude balloon.  PD));2018-08-14 06:30:00;2.5 hours;It was 6:30 am the sun was just coming up.  We’re a masonry crew building a ((name deleted)) car wash on eagle road in meridian Idaho.  I run a high lift and was sending mortar up to the guys on the scaffolding.   When I boomed up the tub full of mortar, I noticed the whole crew was looking at the sky.  I shut off my machine and hollerd up to them.  What are you guys looking at.  That’s when they pointed out to me a pill shaped object in the sky.  It literally hung in the sky in one place till around 8:30 am.  Between those hours I went to my truck and got out my binoculars. I passed them around to everyone.  It was a disc.  Metallic and had a linear line running through its center.  With a noticeable circular dome on what appeared to be its top.  But that’s hard to say because it was sanding vertically in the sky.  It was there so long every trade seen it including the project manager and the owner of the project!  I find myself and notice the others now a week later looking towards the sky.    It appeared to all of us to be broke  down stuck there.  With all the fires burning the visibility became obscured.  And that was the last we seen of it.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

photos of bright glittery white lights at 3:30am.;2020-09-28 03:30:00;30 minutes;photos of bright glittery white lights at 3:30am. I have been watching the North/Northwest sky for at least eight years. There are bright white glittery zigzagging lights coming in over the foothills from that direction all the time. A pair of those light came toward my direction, they got kind of close then just hung there in the sky. The lights were quite a distance apart and as high as jets fly. I watched them for a while then noticed another pair of lights coming toward me from the Northwest sky. They kept coming toward my direction, stopped and just hung there, closer than the others. I got my camera out, a Galaxy S20 Ultra 5g and got several pictures of the lights fairly close . The first pair of lights came out fuzzy, they were farther away, but the second ones look like the photos the airforce got a while back of the UFO under the plane. I actually felt like these beings or ? were watching me, they just stayed there at a dead stop.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
