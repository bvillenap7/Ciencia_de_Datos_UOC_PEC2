Shining sphere speeds accross sky towards Southeast.;2002-07-02 14:30:00;45 seconds;Shining sphere speeds accross sky towards Southeast. I was laying on a hammock in the back yard watching hawks circling overhead when I saw a bright, shining sphere moving Southeast at great speed. I got up to watch the object and was able to see it until it went behind a house on the hill behind Me. There was no visible trail and no sound from the craft as far as I could tell. The whole incident lasted about 45 seconds. Approximatly 2 years ago, Myself, my 2 sons and three people next door witnessed a similar object stationary in the sky just South of the airport. This sighting was verified by a friend that worked at air traffic control tower at the airport. He said they had been tracking this object for three days.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
White Spherical objects seen;2009-03-12 16:15:00;5 minutes;White Spherical objects seen I was at the dentist office getting my teeth cleaned.  I was reclined so that I was facing the window.  I was staring off into the blue sky when I noticed two distinctly spherical shaped objects slowly drift by at an altitude of about one thousand feet or so.  They were white in color.  They were moving at a slow rate of speed, and as I began to lose sight of them I noticed that one of them split off from the other one and began flying in a perpendicular direction from the other one.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
6-8 yellowish orange spheres moving from downtown Boise towards the hills.;2012-05-05 22:00:00;10 mins;6-8 yellowish orange spheres moving from downtown Boise towards the hills. May 5 2012 .( cinco de mayo) Just turning 10:00 pm in the evening , me , my son , and husband stepped out of the house for a walk.  Just outside our house in the sky we I noticed a glowing orange sphere of in the distance ,between the two large trees . It was traveling to the right and as it moved another orange sphere falllowed it's trail . My husband began recording the objects on his cell phone.As the objects went behind the tree he could still see the images on his phone, but not to just looking at the tree . We all the walked down to the corner of the road to see if they where still there .At this point my husband stops recording . There was only one sphere behind the tree now.  Just down Meadow St. there where two more orange spheres that seemed to be fallowing eachother headed towards Lucky Peak area ( All of the spheres seamed to be going the same route and direction)I noticed that the farthest sphere down Meadow St. was going fast . As I focused on ! it , it got smaller very quikly, then was gone .(This is when I start to get scared so memory after this point is a little off )As we continued walking down Meadow St. towards the foothills (east) there where 2-3 more orange spheres to the left of us . All in a row .Traveling East to the foothills just as the others . At this point we decide to turn around and go home.When we got home there where two spheres between the trees and we observed before we went in . They seamed to be flickering or glowing . My husband assumes they where chinease lanterns released  for  cinco de mayo ,. but my brother-in-law 5 miles away said he saw something similar in the sky that night .;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Orange/Red glowing spheres flying low, fast and silently in sky;2012-07-02 23:00:00;3 minutes;Orange/Red glowing spheres flying low, fast and silently in sky My husband and I were walking in front of our house in the dark at 10PM Monday night 7/02/12. The first object flew extremely low and was very bright, unlike an aircraft’s lighting.  It was glowing as if on fire, a reddish-orange glow and was completely silent.  At first we thought it was a paper light that had a candle inside that caused it to float in the air because of how low it was and the glow coming from it.   We then we realized it was traveling at the speed of a plane or faster and could not understand why it would be silent yet so illuminated.  There was no logical reason for this aircraft to be undetected without sound yet brighter than any aircraft either of us had ever witnessed. If it was military and was made to be silent why would it look like an obvious glowing ball in the sky?  One minute later the same shape, color and silent aircraft passed by, just as low and kept the same course until we could not see either lights in the distance any more.

Between 5 and 7 orange glowing lights.;2013-10-19 22:00:00;5-10 minutes;Between 5 and 7 orange glowing lights At approximately 22:05 MST on 10/19/13 My wife called me via cell phone after the BSU Homecoming game (we live by the Stadium)   She asked if I could see them when i asked what she told me she saw several (5) orange lights to the left of the moon.  I said that I could not and kept an eye out as i drove as I approached federal way traveling east I saw 7 orbs some distance away floating up into the sky it as hard to say how many there were but it was between 5 and 10, after a few moments they had disappeared.   It is possible that of course these objects were simply balloons, geese,or another commonplace event.  It was however not an airplane as i could clearly see the lights of the aircraft that typically flies over town during games/events.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Yellow orange spheres.;2013-12-13 20:00:00;2 minutes;I witnessed 11 yellow orange spheres flying in a southerly direction.  They first appeared clearing the foothills north of Tablerock.  They were in groups of 3 to 4.  There elevation to my vantage point placed the spheres slightly above Tablerock in the sky.  They disappeared into what I assume was cloud cover south of Tablerock and east of Boise.  No engine noise heard.  They emitted a constant light source with no flashing or intensity change.

Two star-looking lights moving very slowly to the western horizon.;2015-06-12 22:39:00;.25 hours;Two star-looking lights moving very slowly to the western horizon. As I gazed to the western skyline to observe Venus, around 10:39 p.m. MST, I noticed two stars that I have not noticed on other evenings.  Upon further observation, I noticed that they were very slowly heading to the western horizon.   One light was approximately five degrees higher, and to the northwest, than the other light.  The distance between the two lights were about the size of a human fist, with the arm fully extended.   I have observed Japanese Lanterns once on New Year’s Eve and logically assumed that was the answer.  I am not ruling out the possibility of Lanterns, but when I observed Lanterns before, they slowly burned out and simply disappeared.  These however must had been creating light for quite some time, before I noticed them, to reach the altitude that I recognized them to be.   Furthermore, when I went back inside to check my photos, they were still just as ambient as they were when I had first noticed both 15 minutes earlier.  The tree lines began to obstruct my viewing, and that is when I checked my photos.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

Craft was above the cloud line but of unknown altitude.  Object moved from one section of the sky to the other too quickly to be a satellite, but considerably slower than a meteor and left no trail.  No noticeable noise was associated with its movement.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Blue light in the sky making 90-degree turns and moving at high speeds.;2015-08-30 08:30:00;50 seconds;Blue light in the sky making 90 degree turns and moving at high speeds. I was at a friends house in the boise foothills when I saw a blue light in the sky.  It started moving right to left slowly like a plane but then it picked up speed and shot left disappearing as it accelerated.  I ran inside to grab my phone so I could hopefully catch some video and when I came out it had reappeared.  It moved right then sharply down then right and down again moving behind a hill.  I was unable to take any video of the event unfortunately;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
White Sphere materializes out of vapor trail.;2016-06-16 13:00:00;6-7 minutes;White sphere materializes out of vapor trail. Around June 16th, I was out in my backyard talking on the phone to my friend.  This is something I do all the time.  I live fairly close to the Boise Airport and I see planes coming in all the time.  I also watch them fly over all the time on their way to other locations. In my backyard that day as I was watching an airplane that clearly was not landing in Boise because it was I would guess about a half a mile away in the sky.  I was watching this airplane fly over and away from me and I always watch the vapor trail dissipate as I was doing on this day. As the trail broke up into clumps and evaporated one of the clumps did not evaporate and was in fact a perfectly round white ball.  It looked like a giant ping-pong ball hanging there.  I thought that was odd that it was so round and did not evaporate like the rest of the trail.  As I stood there watching it I was trying to figure out what it could be, I have never seen anything like that and I had a light bulb moment and got excited because I was thinking oh cool I’m seeing a weather balloon. However, as I kept staring at this object it did not ascend, or descend it literally just stayed in one spot so I ruled out weather balloon.  I stood there watching it for about another couple of minutes and then it just was gone.  It just disappeared instantly.  It was a clear, sunny day and there was nothing around this object after the trail evaporated.  It was very interesting, so I thought I would share. I am a stay at home mom and a student currently studying for my degree in education.  I am a down to Earth person and do not go around looking for spooks and such.  I thought what I saw was very strange and I could not identify what it was, not only that but the fact that it just stayed there and appeared out of the vapor trail of the airplane gave me pause.   This airplane was a passenger jet heading East flying over the south-east part of Boise. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Hello, I apologize for the mix up with the dates. I was wrapped up with my daughters upcoming wedding. I remember it being a Thursday as I was speaking to my best friend about her leaving the upcoming Sunday to drive up to Boise.

Large green glowing spherical light traveling north at high rate of speed.  No tail, no sound.;2016-08-23 02:00:00;seconds;Large green glowing spherical light traveling north at high rate of speed.  No tail, no sound. A large green glowing spherical light (about the size of a small moon), was sighted directly above in sky, traveling north at the high rate of speed that a shooting star has, but no tail.   The object appeared to be in the near atmosphere.   Lost sight of it due to hillside.   Seemed to be more substantial than refracted or reflected light.  No sound.

I've seeb a lot of STRANGE Stuff .... but ?????? Sitting on my deck having (yes) a Cocktail (1 cocktail) looking up at the sky, in a  north by northeast direction, I observed a sphere-shaped (something) traveling from the north (east) to the south (west) at a high rate of speed.  At first, I thought it was a helicopter and thought, Man that chopper is really moving FAST.  Then, I realized it was not close ... rather some distance away and, quite large. (I guess). Its color was Bright Orange / Yellow / Orage (pulsating).  I have no idea of its size but it did seem to be quite large for a helicopter. It got my attention and just as I was really staring at it .... the Light went out !!!!!!   There was No Cloud Cover so ...... it did not disappear behind the Clouds. There was No Sound (at least that I could hear). I have no idea how far away it was as it was dark here so I couldn't judge. At first, I thought it may have been the international space station but, It WASN'T! This is the 2nd sighting of  ???? in that direction over the last 2 years.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
