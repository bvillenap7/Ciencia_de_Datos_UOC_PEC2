I saw it out on the horizon, and got my brother up, he saw it too.  It was wizzing very fast and had lights all around the side.  It was dark and there were many stars out.  I went to look at my brother and looked back at the UFO and it was gone, dissapered and there was a slight trail going srait up.  I felt dizzy before and when i saw it, but my nausea left when the UFO did.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

It's upper and lower section were barely backlit by shimmering reflective white lights bouncing off the surface. About two minutes into the observation I witness a wall off horizontal to ninety degree vertical light rise from the top of the oject. It rose slowly into the sky until it hit a ninety degee angle and stopped there. The wall of light did not extend beyond the perceived edge of the object though. The object did gain or lose ground in the night sky.  IT simply hovered off the western edge of the sky. It moved twice in my observations.  the first was to the right about one inches relative in the night sky.  It then moved back into place and lifted about one inch upward and it was at that point that ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous.  PD));43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

Cigar-shaped ship, covered In glittery bright white lights.;2017-07-20 03:30:00;1 minute;Cigar-shaped ship, covered In glittery bright white lights. I have been watching bright glittery flashing lights in the sky that do zig zagging bouncing movements, and I was watching one of those when I saw a long cigar shaped ship of some kind moving along at a steady sort of slow pace. It was totally covered in bright glittery white lights. It was flying west to east and it was very high up in the sky out over the foothills in Boise Id. The foothills are north of our house, and most of the glittery zig-zagging bouncing lights I see come in toward our house from over the foothills. The one I was watching when I saw the cigar shaped ship was glittering red white and light blue. Then it got higher up in the sky and changed to solid white glittery lights. The cigar shaped ship went out of view after about a minute.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Large cigar-shaped UFO with visible cabin lights.;2017-12-01 04:00:00;10 minutes;Large cigar shaped UFO with visible cabin lights. I always look out toward the foothills to the north and east to see if there is anything in the sky before I go to bed.  I looked over at the spot that I have been watching for several years where the zigzaging bouncing lights keep appearing, and there was this huge cigar shaped ship, with cabin lights, I could see the windows, it was amazing!!!   The foothill area where I always see the bouncing lights has to be about 2 miles from our house, and this ship looked pretty big, maybe 20 to 25 feet long, at that distance.  I watched this weird ship doing the same bouncing and zigzaging movements as the smaller ships, but it looked more awkward doing the movements than the smaller ships that have been up over the foothills. Then I looked out the bedroom window toward the south, and there were the five glittery lights moving around fast in the sky where I have been seeing them for three years, one is larger and brighter than the others, and has what looks like a bright spotlight, the beam shines down through the atmosphere and is very visible.   Our cats, two in the garage and the one in the house, were all going crazy running around and making lots of noise for no reason, they never do that, and my cell phone that I had just charged up and turned off for the night was almost totally drained when I turned in on in the morning.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Large cigar-shaped UFO with visible cabin lights.;2017-12-06 03:30:00;15 minutes;Large cigar shaped UFO with visible cabin lights. Cigar shaped ship hovering over the foothills, East of our house, about 2 miles away. It did is same bouncing moves that I have seen it do before, covering a large area with each bounce. It would bounce down the hill, about half way down then do a very quick move back to the top of the hill.  This went on for at least 15 minutes, I was tired and couldn't stay awake anymore. There were visible white cabin lights, but not as many as before, there were three, two in the front and one toward the back.  The length of the ship was visible because we had high clouds, so the ship showed up well with the city lights reflecting on the clouds.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
red and white cigar object with a rudder and a stinger on the front top, no noise, then vanished.;2018-07-10 21:15:00;3 minutes;red and white cigar object with a rudder and a stinger on the front top, no noise, then vanished. From our front yard in Meridian my wife and I saw a white object overhead that we thought was an airplane.   Something looked odd about it so I grabbed some binoculars and looked.  The front third was red and the back was white with the two colors divided by a definite line.  It had a rudder but no tail.  It had a long white something sticking out of the top near the front on about a 45 degree angle forward.  I thought it might be a refueling tube, but it was too big around.  It had no wings or tail,  No markings, just red and white.  No noise.  Then it just disappeared.  It didn't fall or speed off, it just vanished.  The sun had just set but was obviously shining on this object.  It flew from south to north.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Cigar-shaped ship.  Glittery lights and strange orange lights.;2018-07-28 04:00:00;30 minutes;Cigar-shaped ship.  Glittery lights and strange orange lights. I looked out the window toward the east, toward the Boise foothills, there were two glittery white lights doing a zigzag pattern in the sky.  They were very high up and moving fast.  I kept watching them and they started to get lower in the sky.  As they came down they were large, maybe 20 feet around and moved off toward the foothills to the east, they finally disappeared.  I kept watching for them to come back when a large cigar shaped ship appeared near the same foothills going west to east, the ship was long, maybe 20 feet around and glittery white. I watched it for about one minute and it vanished out over the foothills. I thought I would look out the bedroom window that faces south and saw two pale orange lights above a tree in our neighbors backyard close to our fence. These lights were about 12 in diameter and 20 to 25 feet high and going in and out of the heavily leafed trees.  These lights each had two pale white beams of light, and it looked like they were searching for something. I quietly opened the window and there was no noise from these lights/small ships at all, they were totally quiet. I started to close the window and the lights froze, like I had been spotted.This scared me a little, so after closing the window and blinds, I opened one single blind just a little to watch them, and they had started moving again, with no sound whatsoever. Then the light vanished into the trees.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
