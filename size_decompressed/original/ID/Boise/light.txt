No noise was audible and the light did not blink. My wife and I were in our backyard looking at the stars tonight at about 1:40 a.m. when my wife noticed what looked like star moving in a straight line from east to west. The object was white in color and looked like it was at a high altitude. At first we thought it was an airplane but then we noticed there was no blinking to the light. It remained constant and there was no audible noise coming from the object. We observed it for about 3 minutes moving slowly across the sky in a straight line, above us at about a 75 degree angle. The object then seemed to disappear in the matter of a second and was not visable again. The sky was clear and there were no clouds.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Bright gold color light that flew west to east.;1999-10-20 07:25:00;3 minutes est;Bright gold color light that flew west to east. I was loading my 5 year old into my wife's car for daycare when I noticed a bright gold light in the constellation Taurus(that is where I first seen it) I brought it to my wife's attention.  We watched it fly over, and agreeded it was not a normal aircraft(live near airport) the light never changed color, and when it was overhead, the lights were still the same, overall, and uniform(unlike aircraft, where when it passes, you can id the different lights)continued to watch as it flew over my house.  My wife left at this point, and I ran in the house I grabbed my binoculars.  I was able to view it from my back yard(facing east) for a few moments before it disapeared from my line of sight(My house is on the backside of a slope, facing away from Boise City.) Through binos, object still appeared as a gold colored light, ball shaped)  Unable to determine elevation, but would guess it was flying around 5-10 thousand feet.  No noise was noticed.  Total time of observation was approx 2 to 3 minutes. Object never strayed off of straight line projectory. Incident occurred approx 1/2hr before sunup.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Extremely bright light that faded to a small red point of light and accelerated rapidly;2003-06-23 22:30:00;10 seconds;Extremely bright light that faded to a small red point of light and accelerated rapidly The night of the event I was standing on my deck looking to the north over the foothills surrounding Boise, Idaho.  I witness a bright bluish-white light appear in the northern sky approx. twice as bright as an aircraft's landing lights.  As I watched the light move in a north/northwest direction I noticed there was no sound.  As the craft moved NNW it slowly faded to a very small point of red light.  I carefully watched to see if I could locate the normal strobe or wing lights of an aircraft, I saw none.  Approx. 5 seconds later the craft accelerated at tremendous speed and disappeared from sight completely.  I have long been a night sky observer and somewhat of an amateur astronomer and therefore can easily discern the difference between what I saw and a meteor or sattelite.  This was neither a meteor nor sattelite. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident is approximate.  PD));43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Strange lights over the Boise foothills (Venus??);2004-07-31 02:45:00;30 minutes;Strange lights over the Boise foothills My wife and I walked outside to say goodbye to a friend that was leaving to go home. When we reached his vehicle parked on the street, I noticed a VERY bright, orangish...white...and even redish at times, light hanging stationary over the NE foothills near the canyon below Lucky peak resevoir. Our friend left figuring it was a planet or something. The wife and I continued to watch the light curiosly knowing it wasn't a planet, or a fixed winged aircraft of any type. It hoverd silent and motionless except for the lights that were dancing on it. It almost sparkled. I went inside a grabbed some binoculars for a better look. Through the binoculars the light seemed to change shape, moving from one light and seperating into two, and back again. We were unable to notice this change with the naked eye. This took place over a period of about 30 minutes. Getting tired of sharing a pair of bi-nocs, I went inside to grab second pair. Upon my return my wife stated that the light had seperated in two,(this time visable with the naked eye), and slowly decended in tandom behind the mountains not to be seen again.

A collection of flashing lights moving quickly across the sky.  Too many to be airplanes.;2007-11-29 18:50:00;10 minutes;A collection of flashing lights moving quickly across the sky.  Too many to be airplanes. My wife was coming home with our 9-year-old daughter  from her dance class. We live right on edge of the desert, and as my wife and daughter pulled up to the driveway, my daughter said, Mommy why are those stars blinking? My wife looked and says it appeared the Little Dipper was blinking.  They then realized the stars were moving some staying.  Some moving. Some up. Some Down. They appeared to be traveling from the northwest to the southeast.   When I saw them they were at a far distance and heading in the direction of Mountain Home Air Force Base.  Wife's account- When I first saw these twinkling stars they appeared to be at about an 80 degree angle from the street on which I was driving.  I watched them for about 2 minutes.  They did not change their course.  It looked to me like the Little Dipper blinking in the sky.  By the time I got my husband outside to see what we were seeing, the Little Dipper had quit blinking, but there were still blinking lights in the not-so-far distance.  My first thought was that these were the lights of an airport tower - a signal warning airplanes about aerial lines or an upcoming runway.  But I then realized that in the more than five years that I've lived at this house, I have never seen towers.  Another thought was that it was several airplanes in the sky.  The lights were too many and too close to be airplane lights.  About 10 minutes after the sighting I went to get the mail and noticed what appeared to be a military helicopter flying above the desert where the lights were seen flashing.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

Red, slowly pulsating light, that hovered in the north for twenty minutes.;2009-09-18 23:00:00;20 minutes;Red, slowly pulsating light, that hovered in the north for twenty minutes. I was sitting on my patio listening to the Boise State-Fresno game ( I don't have ESPN) at around 11:00 pm 9/18/09, and looking north I noticed a small bright red light . As I watched it hover in mostly one spot (it did slowly drift to the west) it would get brighter and then fade slowly. It slowly pulsated this way the whole time I watched it for about twenty minutes. It finally just faded away altogether like it was moving away north at what would have to be a high rate of speed.  I doubt any one else in Boise witnessed this because most would be watching the game on TV. BSU football is that big here. This object looked like no aircraft I've ever seen or heard of. I couldn't tell how far or altitude but if I had to guess, I would say it was very high in the sky and fairly far, because it was pretty much just a spot of light. I wanted to get my wife and video camera but didn't want to miss what it might do. I will be watching your site to see if anyone else spotted this.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

Looking south-southeast from North Boise, a bright white object fell from an angle of about 60 degrees to 30 degrees within 3 seconds then leveled off.  The object appeared to be moving away and to the west for about one second, then I lost view of it behind trees.  The object had the brightness comparable to a firework flare but did not either sparkle or change color.  The magnitude or brightness did not change as compared to a firework flare and decelerated and changed direction.  My best guess would be that it was south of the Boise metro area.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

For a second I thought it was just a satellite because it was moving at about the same speed, however, it was much lower than satellites fly and the light was brighter.  I noticed a plane flying behind it but at a much lower altitude and way slower. It was a solid light not blinking like a plane and it was moving sporadically side to side up and down not drastically but similar to what a plane would look like in turbulent sky's.  The light was too high and too bright to be a plane.  I followed the light for about 30-40 seconds then it got dimmer and dimmer even though it did not change its altitude or speed than at about the minute mark it just disappeared into the stars.  It didn't streak or fade like a shooting star it just slowly vanished like a flash light dying.  In conclusion it was definitely not a satellite, or a shooting star or a plane unless it was some super sonic s! ilent jet flying at an astronomical hight and speed in very turbulent sky and slowly dimmed its lights than turned them off all together and was flying in the dark.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

Bright Red UFO Seen Over Boise at End of Hyde Street Fair;2011-08-16 22:22:00;10 minutes;Bright Red UFO Seen Over Boise at End of Hyde Street Fair This event is unique as it is an ANNUAL sighting of what appears to be the exact same UFO over Boise during a specific event.  I have seen several UFO's since living in the Boise area and have reported most of them on this website... including last year's event of the Red UFO above Boise after the Hyde Street Fair.  This sighting occurred less than an hour ago one year after the previous sighting and was witnessed by the same person (myself).  The details are as follows. This sighting is of a Red pulsating light type UFO that made no sound.  The UFO was visible in the sky approximately 15 degrees above the horizon from my perspective.  Note that I have many satellite tracking and planetary tracking programs and always check possible sightings against this database to rule out publicly known manmade objects.  This red UFO is not a publicly known satellite, nor planet, nor star, nor did it behave like one.  It pulsated a pure red glow at regular intervals that seemed to repeat there was a complex pattern to it that I was not able to decipher--I had enough time to run inside and grab a camcorder to try filming it, but unfortunately could not focus on the object.  Oddly, my camcorder which normally functions perfectly, would not focus with automatic or manual operation. The red UFO bobbed up and down slightly for about 10 minutes, then suddenly moved (as seen from my perspective in the North End of Boise) at what looked to be an incredible speed to the East.  It then faded out of sight within 2 minutes after it exited it's hover phase. Note that the author does not drink alcohol nor is prescribed any medication.  I am a professional engineer and trained as a pilot.  I was completely awake and sober during the observation so nothing was clouding my observation.  I also trained as a Law Enforcement Officer in California in 2005.  So I have training in observation and reporting.  That said, I still don't know what these objects are but I didn't believe in UFO's until I started seeing them with (alarming?) regularity several years ago.  Even after capturing one event at extreme close proximity I still had my doubts could they not in fact be natural phenomenon?  This event though occurred two years in a row after the Hyde Street Fair in Boise.  The position of the craft was different (last year, directly overhead/this year, to the East-South-East) but it appeared after the Fair ends.  Note also that I am outside in my front yard looking at the sky with binoculars or a telescope most nights of the year (appro! ximately 275/365) and have only seen this object in the second or third week of September... There is a good chance it will be seen on September 17th at 22:20.  Look for a Bright Red pulsating object in the shape of a light in the direction of the East-South-East from any location in or around downtown Boise.  Make sure there is a fairly dark area of the sky visible with no lights from the ground, and that no buildings and/or trees obscure the horizon from approximately 0-15 degrees above it, as referenced by overhead being 90 degrees and the opposite horizon being 180 degrees.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Reported light may not have been the ISS.;2011-08-30 22:30:00;5 Minutes;Reported light may not have been the ISS. I am writing this report as an attachment, and in reference to another report that was recently filed through your agency.  The report that I am referring to is the one that is sited below... Occurred : 8/15/2011 22:00 (Entered as : 08/15/2011 22:00) Reported: 8/15/2011 9:15:19 PM 21:15 Posted: 8/21/2011 Location: Boise, ID Shape: Circle Duration:5 minutes high flying thing  I happen to go out in the back yard and watched this thing. It was moving from south west to north east. No blinking lights and it was just between a plane and a satellite. What moves like that? If it was a satellite it would have changed its brightness and be in a polar orbit. No way it was a meteor. No plane flies this fast. ((NUFORC Note: ISS over-flight at 21:57 hrs. SW to NE. PD))     I also live in Boise, Idaho and have seen these lights as well on numerous occasions.  The reason that I am disputing the claim that what was seen is the ISS, is due to the fact that on the evenings that I witness these lights I sometimes see multiple lights within an hour of each other, or sometimes within minutes of each other.  They are not always traveling from the Southwest to the Northeast.  Over a period of about two years I have seen these same objects, and I have also witnessed them traveling from due South, to due North.  I have also seen them bend their trajectory, and alter their velocity from slow to very fast.  These objects appear at first as a very bright white light, (sometimes amber in color), and appear to be intelligently controlled.  They travel along at a steady velocity, and then fade in their intensity, then just simply blink out and disappear.  These objects are moving far too slowly to be a meteorite, and far too fast to be an airplane.  They appear! to be above the upper atmosphere, as there is absolutely no sound associated with them.  These objects are one solid color.  (As I mentioned above, white or amber).  There are no FAA lights on them whatsoever. (Red,Green, or strobing). I usually see them between 22:00 and 24:00 Hours.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

The light in the Northeast responded to this flash from the first object, and itself flashed and began moving towards the first object in the Northwest.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Red Light SO FAST N SILENT! Now there are Helicopters flying all over the place?;2011-12-22 08:37:00;less than 2 min;Red Light SO FAST N SILENT! Now there are Helicopters flying all over the place? I was sitting in my hot tub with a friend and we thought we saw a shooting star but then it was still there and going so fast yet not fading at all, it continued towards the east here in Downtown Boise Idaho and then suddenly it fled off to the south so fast that we have never seen anything like it. Here is the kicker, there are helicopters flying all over the same pattern that the UFO had flown and have been going in circles all night now for 3 hours. I never EVER hear them this late over here near Hyde park. Something is clearly going on, the choppers seem to keep going in the SAME EXACT pattern as the AMBER LIGHT we saw. The light was LARGE, it seemed akin to the afterburner from a fighter jet, but NO SOUND and the speed was so fast that if it had been a jet of any kind it would have broken the sound barrier. I use to live next to top gun in San Diego CA, so I am quite familiar with the sounds and speed of the f-14 and other fighter jets. This was NOTHING like those at all. I am not one to write in to a UFO sight, and to be honest I would not be doing it had I not noticed these helicopters flying all over the place tonight. I have gone out 3 times now to see over 5 choppers flying around and again EXACTLY where we saw the UFO. This is NOT the 1st time I have seen something like this, back in 1995 I was in Ocotillo Wells and 7 of us saw a formation of 9 lights that hovered in the sky for 35 min, BRIGHT, and silent. We at one point thought they were flares but they never dropped from the sky. Having been there only at night at that point we figured there were mountains and some lights were on top of them, however when we woke the next morning, there were no mountains in sight. Whatever we saw tonight has sparked the interest of the helicopters. I just looked up other peoples sightings in the area and here is what I found and it seems this is NOT the 1st time. http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/ndxlID.html  http://www.examiner.com/ufo-in-national/probe-appears-200-feet-over-idaho-park-and-morphes-into-egg-and-boomerang    I was not able to find anything on your site dealing with Boise Idaho?;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

Both of us had never seen a craft that dimmed and brightened like that in the sky. There was no audible noise coming from it, but it looked to be high in the sky.  It lasted until we left.

The light was morphing in color from red to orange and seemed to have a glowing haze around it.  It appeared almost blurry at times.  The object was moving parallel to the horizon at a very slow rate of speed. As the object moved off to the Northwest, it seemed to either accelerate, or blink out because the light turned a solid red color and became significantly smaller in size. The object emitted no sound whatsoever and was at a distance relative to us where we would have heard at least residual engine noise.  From where our position was, I would estimate the dis stance of the object to be about 10 miles away, and about 20 to 30 degrees off the horizon.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

Four orange orbs over Boise early new years day.;2014-01-01 00:15:00;3-4 minute;Four orange orbs over Boise early new years day. Just after midnight on January 1st I was getting ready for bed and looked out the window and saw two orange globes of light coming from the south.  It was somewhat hazy toward the horizons but clear overhead, and it seemed they were slowly moving low and underneath the fog.  I grabbed my girlfriend and we both ran outside to get a better look.  When we looked up there were two more orange lights already hovering almost directly overhead, slightly to the southeast.  One was stationary and the other one seemed to hover slowly around it in an irregular pattern.  They two orbs we oringinaly saw came to a stop just to the south of the other two.  They started to fly around each other in a random pattern.  After a few minute the oringinal two orb seemed too get higher and higher towards the southeast until they slowly faded out of sight.  One of the other ones followed about half a minute later.  The stationary light was last and seemed got go straight up until it! faded away.  I was searching the web and have not seen anything else anywhere about this sighting.  Last year I had seen lights similar to this just after midnight on new years eve, but they were to the north and much further away.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

Several yellowish/orange spheres of light rising out of the SW sky of Boise, ID.  ((NUFORC Note:  Witness is commercial pilot.  PD));2014-04-25 21:15:00;8 minutes;Several yellowish/orange spheres of light rising out of the southwestern sky of Boise, ID On Friday, April 25, 2014, at approximately 2115 MDT, I went out into my front yard to turn on our lamppost light.  As I approached the post, I noticed strange lights rising out of the southwestern sky climbing at a rapid rate and seemingly in trail of each other. At first glance, I thought I was seeing the Idaho Air National Guard A-10's getting a little night currency.  A few seconds later I realized that they were not A-10's, and thought perhaps they might be guard helicopters?  After studying the phenomenon for a few more seconds, I concluded that the lights were not consistent in appearance or in movement of any kind of aircraft that I was familiar with.  They seemed to rise out of the southwest sky in trail formation at 3 to 5 second intervals appearing as round, reddish orange, balls of light with tiny black rectangles in their centers. The first one that got my attention was soon followed by a 2nd ,3rd, and 4th.  Their movement progressed from my right to my left rising to about 4000 AGL and estimated to be about 4 to 5 miles south of me.  As I realized more were coming, I shouted to my wife to run and see what was going on.  She immediately confirmed what I was seeing and I dashed back into the house to collect my camera.  In my excitement, fumbling with the settings, I cranked off several seconds of video and a few still photos all of poor quality before they finally disappeared.  In all, I estimate  12 to 14 objects appeared over about an 8 minute period with irregular intervals of longer duration towards the end of the sighting. The lights reached their apex to the southeast of me and as the lights faded, the black objects in their centers appeared to tumble away in the diminishing light.  I asked my wife to go in and call the media but she was reluctant to do so.  We had been having rain showers prior to the incident and during the sightings I could hear sirens in the distance which were picked up on the video.  We decided to go back to our TV program and wait for the 10 o’clock news expecting that hundreds of people would be reporting the sightings.  Astonishingly, nothing appeared on the TV news or in the newspapers that evening or the days following. A few days later I sent an email to friends and family describing what I saw and attached a few photos captured out of my very shaky video.  All had opinioned explanations of what they might have been like .... flares, fireworks or the like,  none of which matched the criterion of the scenario I observed.  It is not likely that flares or fireworks would rise out of the horizon, travel over several miles across a populated city and not draw somebody's  attention .

Unknown, shiny object in the early evening sky, round in shape.;2015-09-19 15:00:00;<1 minute;Unknown, shiny object in the early evening sky, round in shape. We were traveling through a suburban street headed West at approximately 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, August 19, 2015, when we saw a shiny object in the South West Sky.  The weather was clear there were no clouds.  It looked like a star if it would have been dark.   The object was moving away from us and at a low  altitude that most of the air planes in this area ( we have a National Air Port about 3 miles to the East-it was not a plane) approach for landing and a National Guard Base in the same area (again, it was not a plane).  It appeared then disappeared.   About 5 minutes later, we saw the same type of Shiny Object approaching from the North West.  I thought it could have been the nose of an incoming jet and waited for a better view of the wings or body.  It wasn’t a plane and it disappeared too, just a quickly as the first sighting.   As we discussed what it wasn’t, we concluded neither of these objects were known air craft, balloons, flares, kites, etc. We are an adult couple and have not reported to this site previously. We thought this event should be documented, as these were quite strange objects.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

Odd Moving Glittery Light.;2016-07-17 03:00:00;15 minutes;Odd Moving Glittery Light I noticed this round glittery white, pinkish,greenish light, it was moving in odd patterns, zigzags, bouncy dance like movements,  it would zip fast left or right quite a distance then return. It would move straight ahead very slowly, then pick up its pace.  This has gone on for four nights and is always at the same time.  At one point when it was closer the first night it looked like beings moving back and forth inside a brightly lit window, but I only got a quick glimpse of it before it took off again. It has always shown up a little north west of Bogus Basin Ski area from about 4 to 5 miles from downtown Boise going west on State St.  Last night the round light did a couple of things differently than the previous nights, as I was watching it, at the bottom of the light there was a bright greenish burst of light just for a second. Then it did its regular zigzags and back and forth up and down dancing movements, then it started shooting out these sort of long looking things that were glowing sort of whitish and as they fell they vanished.  Also, lastnight was the first time the glittery light went out, three different times, but reappeared in the same exact spot.  I did notice that if a car came down the main street we live by, the light would not move, until the car was gone. I have never heard a sound from this light.  I will be watching for it again tonight.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

It seemed to be barely moving so I drove in its direction (west), and every time I was able to see it, unobstructed, it seemed to be moving very slow and very low to the ground.  When I was able to get a better look (south), I could see there was some shape to it, so it was not just an orb of light, but the shape was not like anything I’ve ever seen.

Strange silent moving lights near the ground.;2018-08-23 03:30:00;30 minutes;Strange silent moving lights near the ground. I looked out a south facing window to see if anything odd was in the sky. I didn't see anything up there but I did see a weird light close to the ground,like I have been seeing for a while. This was one bright white light moving around in an empty lot close to our house, it made no sound, but moved like someone walking around holding a flashlight. It had a bouncy movement, and there was no sound at all, and no sound from the dry grass and weeds in the lot like the sound someone walking around would make.  Also there was no visible being of any kind with the light. The light was a single beam about 4 or 5 inches in diameter. I went to our north facing bedroom window to see if anything was on that side of the house, and there was what looked like a pair of lights moving together hovering about 5 above our streetabout 30 feet away.  At first I thought they were a reflection from a porch light, but they were moving very slowly from the west end of our street toward the east. This is the third time I have seen the lights on this side of the house, they make no sound at all and whatever this is, it is totally invisible except for the light, which can be dim or bright, and are sometimes an orange or white beam.  I watched them for about 20 minutes, they would move very slowly back and forth along our street, but only in the dark areas, never near a porch light, and we have no street lights on our street.  They kept stopping in front of our nextdoor neighbors house west of us, p.o he never has a light on at night so I just watched them for a while.  They kept going over a small area around his front yard and driveway. These lights are probably the same ones I saw a couple of weeks ago going over another neighbors trash can, and also moving around two different neighbors cars.

The lighting in the parking lot made it hard to decipher my surroundings.   As I kept telling myself, it's just airplanes.

As I assessed when I got to my car.  The lights weren't flashing, nor were they white or blue, as an airplane would be.  I was walking with my co workers they seemed it was a bit odd but they had split up as we walked further through the parking lot.

26 extremely fast moving objects in the sky above Boise, Id.  ((Starlink satellites?));2020-04-16 10:00:00;20 minutes;26 extremely fast moving objects in the sky above Boise, Id. Two of my friends and myself were outside in front of the house and noticed moving objects in the sky. The thing that caught our attention was how fast they were moving at how high of an altitude they were at.  I have never seen any man made object move that fast being that high up.  We started counting the objects as more kept coming, we counted 26 objects coming from the west heading east until we couldn't see anymore.  They were all going the same speed and what looked like the same altitude.  They were all to high up to make out anything other than a pin of light, they looked like stars they were so far up.  I'm sure this info isn't too important but I felt like sharing it.  It was a pretty exciting moment.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

I was heading to Boise on the highway from Mtn. Home, I saw what looked to me like an airplane coming towards Boise Airport. It stayed in about the same place for several minutes and then suddenly in less than a second it flashed across the sky in less than a second and vanished.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
One light, two lights. Three lights, four.. and they're gone.;2021-01-14 18:15:00;30 seconds;One light, two lights. Three lights, four.. and they're gone. As I sat in my car facing SE, I saw a single orange light appear far in skyline. Then an additional orange light appeared adjacent to it at maybe a 45 degree slope. Then the 3rd and then 4th lights appeared, all uniformly slanting down. And then all four lights disappeared at the same time. My coworker who just left our work saw the same thing a half mile away.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
FAST MOVING CRAFT.;2021-03-29 22:00:00;15 seconds;FAST MOVING CRAFT. My wife and I were driving into Boise when I saw a quick flash of light beam across the sky a few hundreds of yards above the ground. It was headed towards Mountain Home. When I saw this I called it out to my wife and she witnessed it until it disappeared. I then called my brother and his wife who were 5 minutes behind me and they both witnessed the exact same thing. This was the fastest thing I have ever witnessed. 100 percent UFO.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
