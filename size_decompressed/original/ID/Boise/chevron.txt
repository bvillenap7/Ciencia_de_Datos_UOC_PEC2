Fast and middle-low flying Boomerang with 3 lights and no sound !;2005-10-13 05:05:00;3-4 seconds;Fast and middle-low flying Boomerang with 3 lights and no sound ! It was 5:05AM in the morning and pretty dark outside. I was standing in the backyard and smoking a cigarette. I watched the sky 'cause of the fantastic star panorama and I could see satellites passing the sky.   I was watching straight up as I suddenly noticed a dark object in the sky.  The object was definitely darker than the sky and had 3 lights -- short flashing.  I would say the light were red, orange.  Difficult to determine in that short time.  The object looked like a boomerang. The light were on each side of the boomerang and one in the front.  However, this object moved into east south-east (ESE) direction which is also the direction of Boise Airport.  I followed with my eyes this object and it looked like to me that this object reduced of a moment its speed and speeded up again.  There were no sound - and no visible engine activities.  My first thought was:  way too fast for a plane...to slow for a meteorite.   The complete scenario last for approx. 3 to 4 seconds.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
V-shaped UFO over Boise's Northend.;2013-10-15 20:00:00;30 seconds;V-shaped UFO over Boise's Northend. I was enjoying the evening sitting on my porch.  The moon was almost full, so the sky was quite light.  Believe me, I wasn't looking for anything I was just admiring the stars.   Anyway, I saw this V-shaped sort of mirage finally, it was defined enough for me to see that it had lights in on it perimeters--outside and in.  Then it took a ninety degree turn and disappeared...  Amazing--DEFINITELY NOT AN AIRPLANE. Wow.....;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
2 objects spotted in Southwest Boise, late evening.;2014-07-29 20:45:00;5 minutes;2 objects spotted in Southwest Boise, late evening. Two objects at cloud level moving slowly in a uniform direction.  Unable to identify what types of objects.  Seemed to be about 100 ft away from each other moving from southwest toward northeast.  Silver/ Black in color.   A video was taken of the objects.  Very odd shape, hard to identify precisely, there were no wings and the objects moved fairly slowly.   The objects apparently shifted direction mid-air and moved southwest according to the second witness.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
