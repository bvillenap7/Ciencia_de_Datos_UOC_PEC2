Light formation passes directly over 3 witnesses.;2003-07-09 23:15:00;10 min.;Light formation passes directly over 3 witnesses. Myself and 2 of my neighbors were outside visiting and looking at the stars when I noticed 3 lights traveling Eastward in a triangular formation. They were very high up and moving quite slowly. At first We thought that it might be satalites but, they were moving much too slow and too perfectly aligned. The lights never changed in intensity, color or distance from each other. There was 1 in front and the other 2 were behind and to the sides. We could see stars pass through the formation as it moved, so I'm sure it was not a solid structure/craft with marker lights. We watched the formation until it went completely out of view to the East. ((NUFORC Note:  We suspect the witnesses may have been witness to the U. S. Navy triplet of NOSS satellites, which fly in formation.  PD));43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

Formation of 2-3 crafts.;2013-09-18 21:11:00;35 seconds;formation of 2-3 crafts Two small crafts not quite blinking but lights going on and off about 2 sec inbetween flashes and both crafts moving towards and away from each other.  Lights were going one after another for a few secs and then started flashing together and thats when the third light came up from our line of sight over the houses across the street.  As soon as we saw that there was 3 we tried to get on my truck to see better and they took off towards the south.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

I thought it was an odd pattern of stars at first.   As I kept walking and staring at the lights, they started to disappear one by one.  It was dark, so my depth perception may have been off.  I didn't notice the lights moving, unless they were moving away from me.   After they disappeared, I looked around and noticed there were too many lights around to see any stars.  I don't know what this was, but it was definitely a light anomaly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
