As big as a thumb at 12 feet. I observed this horseshoe shaped craft at exactly 01:20 on that morning. The night was very clear and warm. The craft made no sound as it travelled at a fast speed from North to South directly over the city. The white lights were not bright, and the area between the lights was a dull reddish glow. The size was as big as my thumb held in front of me and the spot on a wall at 12 feet away. I estimate that the height was 2,000 feet in altitude. I contacted the airport and was told there were no aircraft in the area. NOTE: The city street lights illuminated the bottom of the craft.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Giant blue V flying south over airport during 9-11 no-fly;2001-09-12 03:00:00;10 seconds;Giant blue V flying south over airport during 9-11 no-fly at 3am i was facing south towards the airport on Vista ave.   It was during the no fly rule from 9-11 so this big flying v caught my eye.  It seemed to travel south (over the airport).  I jumped in my truck and started heading south to see what it was.  it was gone before i started driving, and the lack of anyone on the road reacting or following it made me give up.   Huge blue v streaking southbound over Boise Airport.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

The object did not move but stayed in one place in the sky for at least 45 minutes or more.  It was not a plane or helicopter or satellite but nothing any of us have ever witnessed before.  Eerie feeling watching this.  Not a usual sighting.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

I observed either 8 to 10 legs and they had yellow lights that blinked on the ends and there was yellow/orange lights spaced evenly. When it turned it had flashing red lights on the front of the craft. It was travelling in a eastern direction and then slowly turned to the southwest.  It appeared to be travelling slower then any aircraft.  Also it wasn't following any set pattern for normal aircraft in area.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Large translucent orange/gold v-shaped object flying from wast to west in straight line;2010-07-11 22:45:00;20 seconds;Large translucent orange/gold v-shaped object flying from wast to west in straight line I was outside in my backyard watching for meteors when I noticed a large anomaly moving from east to west at a very high altitude.  The object had a translucent faint orange/gold semi v-shaped leading edge and was shaped similar to a flying wing type aircraft only much, much larger with a transparent look to it.  The object moved in a straight line from roughly east to west, making no sound, and traversed the entire visible sky in less than 30 seconds.  I am very familiar with all types of conventional aircraft having been a plane enthusiast for over 30 years, and this object fit no description of anything I have ever seen.   It had no marker lights and was much too large and fast to be any ordinary aircraft.  Its absolutely straight course, translucent appearance and color, and its shape and immense size would discount the possibility of it being a searchlight, reflection, or other easily explainable source.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Multiple Fiery Orbs sighted in n./s. flight over w. Boise over 1+ hr period;2012-07-04 22:30:00;1+ hours;Multiple Fiery Orbs sighted in n./s. flight over w. Boise over 1+ hr period RED ORBS OVER N.W. BOISE AND MERIDIAN, ID----7/4/12 AND 7/5/12  My daughter was outside with her family on the night of the 4th in n.w. Boise, ID watching fireworks.  She noted a bright red orb(about marble-size at arms length) moving slowly from north to south.  As it got away to the south, it seemed to split in two and fade. Somewhat later three more came along(the same general path) and also flew about the same speed. There was a fairly-low cloud cover and these were all below that. Later two more appeared and one of those seemed to curve to the s.e. after passing her area and then slowly faded.  All these events happened probably between 10PM and midnight. [As an aside, both her family and I are inveterate aircraft buffs and know what they look-like,  sound-like day or night.] She then called me around midnight(0 hrs...7/5/12)(I live 4 mi. to her s.w and have seen UFO's in my earlier years)and I decided to go outside with 10x binoculars and see if I could see anything.  There was a line of clouds above my house that stretched easterly. I did focus my binoculars on the brightest star to get it set for infinity.  After a wait of maybe 10 minutes I did notice a bright red 'large-star-sized' object moving slowly from north to south. It was in the general direction of my daughter's house.  I used a steady-rest to stop the tremors and watched the object for about 5 min.  It seemed to slow and then either slowly-extinguish or blend into the clouds. I stayed out for another 10 minutes and seen nothing else similar and retired to the house.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Supersonic, silent aircraft with multiple lights, and one extremely bright white flashing light.;2012-11-05 23:00:00;2.5 seconds;Supersonic, silent aircraft with multiple lights, and one extremely bright white flashing light. 11:00pm (approx) sky conditions: night, mostly clear, little ambient brightness, dim moon  PRE-SIGHTING  I was walking towards a house, about to knock on the door to enter when a helicopter began to amble by, a few hundred feet off the ground parallel to me, maybe half a mile away. the fact that it sounded heavy and had distinct lighting gave me the impression that it was a military helicopter, so i studied it as i knocked on the door. it was flying West to East. SIGHTING  it was at this point an object emerged from the eastern horizon, flying east to west at over supersonic speeds. it flew maybe 800+ feet above (although not directly 'above', likely on its flank a bit as it was hard to tell from my angle) the chopper. it made no sound at all and gave no heat or other effects and crossed the entire sky in about 2 and a half seconds. It had one indescribably bright light on the center of the object, that flashed at regular intervals. the 'light' had only a few chances to flash due to the objects' speed. the light was so bright, so intensely white that you could see every color of the rainbow streaming within the light. there were perhaps other, dimmer white lights that stayed on constantly, placed around the craft. The main body of the craft was very hard to distinguish in the darkness, but the lights on its own body gave some ambient illumination to itself. i could barely make out the greyed outline of a bizarre, somewhat triangle shaped craft. when the light would flash, it would be blocked out by the intensity. when it was off briefly, there was still light emerging from the craft, although not as bright. the lights on the object far outshone that of the helicopters', even the moon. the light was distinctly inhuman. Because of the sudden nature of the event, i did not really try to make sure i would remember the details of the craft itself, as i was still what i would describe as 'calmly-lobotomized', staring like an idiot into the sky away from their house as someone opened the door. I believe there is a possibility that the chopper pilots may have also seen the craft, although given its speed and silent nature there is a chance they only saw a white flash in the corner of the eyes. Choppers seemed to remain in the sky for the rest of the night as i saw one driving a few hours later and also heard another when i got home. I give an estimate of 900+ feet for the elevation of the craft, and perhaps about the size of a good boat, quit a bit larger than a fighter jet. I have seen F-16s, F-15s, F-22s, F-18s, MiGs, at night, at day, flying high, low, supersonic, really slow, you name it. I have looked down the barrel an A-10 Warthogs' Gatling gun.  I  have seen b-2 spirits, Stealth fighters, both parked and flying in close detail(although men guarded the F117 nighthawk) i have been in a V-22 Osprey helicopter, hueys, Apaches, UH-60 Blackhawk, freaking chinooks.  I have been on countless commercial aircraft of all make and size my whole life. This was NOT a known aircraft, to be certain. it demonstrated distinctly inhuman traits. if it was human, i conjecture top secret military craft. It should be noted that this was certainly a 'craft', and not a natural phenomenon. It was NOT a meteor or balloon of any type.  It was not ball lightning. it was not an aurora,a moon halo, it was not swamp gas, sun dogs, it was not a lenticular cloud, or any other type of electromagnetic/plasma phenomenon. it was not gary busey eyeing the world dangerously as he travels in his home-made craft powered out of fear and childrens' screams. it was not santa, it was not a satellite, it was not a missile test. as someone who is extensively familiar with both military/civilian aircraft and astronomical phenomenon, all i can say with absolute assurance is this was an unidentified, constructed object exhibiting inhuman traits flying in proximity to aircraft with zero explanation and no other way of seeing it was there (radar?) other than eyesight.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

Silent Grey Hovering Plane.;2014-05-13 13:45:00;2-3 minutes;Silent Grey Hovering Plane. It was a normal day like any other.  Sun was out and not much of a breeze. We were driving down a very busy street in boise by the mall.  I noticed what looked like a grey colored airplane flying low toward us but to the left and slowing down.  I commented to the driver that plane looks like its going to crash.  Then as we drove down the 35 mph street the grey looking airplane came to what looked like a complete stop in the sky above some residental houses on a hill behind some big businesses.  We had hit a red light.  The airplane hovered over the tree line looking like it was decending.  I turned the radio down.  There was not a sound to be heard, other than the other traffic.  We stared at the grey, hovering too low and not moving, way to silent aircraft.  I noticed there were no propellers or moving parts of any kind.  The tail of the plane looked like it had a double fin, like a car spoiler.   I am a very logical minded person who can find an explanation for almost anything.  This dumbfounded me.  I talked with a good friend who works at a crop dusting outfit, and explained him this story.  I asked his opnion.  He said that sounds like a bona fide UFO.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

Odd shaped ship under the Moon.;2021-01-20 15:15:00;3 seconds;Odd shaped ship under the Moon. I was taking pictures of the Moon with my Samsung Galaxy s20 Ultra 5g phone. I had taken around 30 pictures, and was just about ready to go in the house, then decided to take a few more. I took three more, reviewed all of my photos and the next to the last one had this black thing in it. I enlarged it and was shocked to see this odd shaped ship thing in it hanging in the air under the Moon. It isn't in any other photo. I was taking Moon pictures from our backyard facing the Southeast. Shortly after I took the Moon and ufo photo, an airforce jet went over close to where I saw the ufo. I have a picture of it also.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
