Ship flew away at high speed into stars and left a green/blue light glowing.;2016-08-16 05:30:00;10 seconds;Ship flew away at high speed into stars and left a green/blue light glowing. We were standing outside talking, and then a flash of light caught our attention and we looked in the sky and saw a blueish green light that flew away into the stars at a very high speed.   After what appeared to be a ship flew away, it left a green light glowing in the sky that seemed like a trail.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

Silent, bright, extremely fast moving object changed direction;2019-08-25 12:00:00;1-2 seconds;Silent, bright, extremely fast moving object changed direction. At roughly midnight, I was in my backyard looking up at the sky.  A diffuse object proceeded from mid sky (it just kind of appeared) and headed in a SSE direction.  I believed it to be a shooting star, as it got brighter as it progressed.  Then, just before it got to the roofline of the neighboring house, it immediately changed direction, heading SE (about 23 degree change).  It then disappeared behind the roofline. The entire occurrence lasted less than 2 seconds. There were no sounds made (airplane/helicopter). I am ex-military (Army), and am also the son of retired military (USAF), so have quite a bit of experience with military aircraft.  This was much faster than I have seen anything move in the sky - like I said, my first impression was a shooting star. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
