Halloween UFO;2000-10-31 07:00:00;4 minutes;Halloween UFO On the night of Halloween 2000, I walked my daughter over to the neighbors, so she could go Trick Or Treating with her friend and her friend's father. I returned home and waited for them to come around the block. At approximately 6:55 p.m. I went to the kitchen window which faces the street in front of our home. The whole street was dark except for the Halloween lights and lite up pumpkins that people had turned on for the occasion.  But to my surprise, I witnessed more then just Halloween lights that night.  For there above my neighbors home, a crossed the street, were two large balls of white light blinking on and off, stationary in the sky.  When one would blink on the other would go off, and when the one that was on would go off, the other would come on.  They did this alternately for about 2 minutes and in perfect time!  One was a bit higher then the other, and after about 2 minutes of this, it lowered so it was parallel with the other.  Then they did a most ! unusual thing, they moved slowly together and became one ball of light.  Then they slowly moved away to the southeast, and as it moved it changed colors from red to blue and green.  At the time I had three pumpkins on my porch lite up and one of them was blinking on and off, and I can't help but wonder if that is the reason they chose to blink on and off like they did.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

It was too fast for a plane, too large for the position in the sky to be a satellie etc... and it really did not to appear to be anything sort of meteor etc. on fire, as the flashing was rythmic and mechanical.

Circle of intensely bright red lights that initially spewed out falling lights and hovered for a long time before receding slowing up.;2009-09-18 21:10:00;30 minutes;Circle of intensely bright red lights that initially spewed out falling lights and hovered for a long time before receding slowing up. We were walking in the Hyde Park area of Boise, I saw the intensely bright red light first and called attention to the others we were walking with.  It was almost over-head, but quite high up, then seemed to move very slowly if at all.  It would pulse, not pulse, pulse a different rhythm, not pulse.  There were four of us, and on a side street we found three more people watching with binoculars.  I looked through the binoculars and could see the circle was made up of a circle of lights.  They'd been watching longer, and said initially it was closer, and sparks were coming off and falling down (though it was still very high up).  The light was intense red, but seemed to be going higher up instead of moving on a northward path as we thought it was at first.  We joked about perhaps being the only sober people in the area as most people were glued to sports bars watching BSU football.  One of the people called her fiance and asked him to go outside his house, an! d he saw the same thing, though I do not know where he was viewing this from.  We watched this for over a half hour, and eventually walked back to our friends house, and them drove home to our house.  We live at the base of a mesa in foothills and the line of sight was not very clear. This was unlike anything any of us had seen.  I took a picture with my phone, but it looks like a red dot in the middle of a black field.  I do not have the proper cord to download it to my computer, nor do I suscribe to any picture services to send via my phone contract.  Any suggestions?  I am fine with talking to someone, but make it day-time to return my call, please.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

Five orangish orbs flying up into sky in between Boise and Arrowrock Reservoir dissapear into sky;2011-12-22 20:00:00;15-20 Min.;Five orangish orbs flying up into sky  in between Boise and Arrowrock Reservoir dissapear into sky December 22, 2011 Northwest Boise facing South East towards Idaho military reserve park (Based upon distance ration in my head relative to an above view on Google maps it seemed as though they came from here but could have been further southeast in the mountains). Smoking a cigarette in back of my moms house with my girlfriend,  from a distance we spotted to the southeast five orangish looking orbs flying up into the sky over some trees as if they were taking off in the distance.  The orbs definently weren't any aircraft I've seen before, they moved as if they were floating in the sky without a care.  Moving left to right and then progressing up with ease definently told me these weren't  normal aircraft.  The colors were of an amberish orange, almost like an oranger darker sun but still very bright.  Shape wise I would say they were circular orbs, we almost thought they were stars at first but then we saw the movement.  Not only did me and my girlfriend see them but we got my mom, sister, and her friend to come out and look at them and they all were astonished. They just slowly progressed up to the sky not in any pattern, other than kinda of a ladder formation where one was higher than the other and so forth, where the last two at the lowest to earth passed by eachother as if they were going to combine but didn't and stayed relatively on the same plain line as they progressed up.  These orbs slowly dissapeared into the sky as they progressed higher slowly flickering in and out of light then completely gone, but what I find most interesting is four of the orbs dissapeared generally low while the fifth orb that was higher than the others from the start of taking off, continued to fly the highest and was the last to be seen.  Figuratively this all lasted about 15 to 20 minutes. This is the first time I've seen a UFO and I was quite intrigued. I've always been interested in extraterrestials and the unexplained since I was a kid but I never really had experience with the subjects, just kind of spectating on the side from what I would hear and see.  But once I saw those orbs I knew for sure there's way more I don't know about this world and it sparked an interest in me to see what else is out there and if this occurence was common or not.  What I found was that it wasn't something new, this occurence has happened all over the world for a few years now.  Ever since then I've been looking at youtube every other day for new sighting caught on tape, as well as theories of extraterrestials and the new coming age of enlightenment. I'm excited.   Oh, lastly I have noticed alot of aircraft flying over Boise recently, especially military helicopters. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

Boise, ID, spherical, 20 min, 10 red lights, seen by husband and wife.;2013-09-09 22:00:00;20 minutes;Boise,ID, Spherical, 20 min, 10 red lights,seen by husband and wife. Sept 9, 2013 (sighting)  Hello Peter,   My husband and I had a UFO sighting (Sept 9, 2013) while on our routine night time bike ride in Boise, Idaho.  We were surprised to see 3 large brilliant red lights off to the left of us, in a V shape formation.  As we watched these 3 lights, additional lights followed. Finally we saw about 10 Red Lights before they, one by one, faded quickly out. These red lights moved slowly and made no sound.  They seemed to stay in that area rather than moving quickly toward us. There was one more mysterious thing in the sky just before they all disappeared.  This thing appeared abruptly from the area in the sky where the red lights were.  It was a simi transparent large square shape with rounded corners. It looked like a large lacy thing flying straight across the sky approximately 500 feet high.  I say it looked like lace because it was a semi transparent thing with tiny bits of solids. None of these lights, or the semi transparent thing made any sound at all.  It was hard for us to gage the highth of these red lights but our guess is around 1,000 feet high, possibly lower.  The diameter of each light may have been approximately 100 feet. Thanks for all you do Peter...we continue to listen to Coast To Coast and appreciate your announcements from time to time.

I went back inside saying look Santa out delivering they came out saying how cool and all that I tried to take a photo or video but it did not show up. Then I tried calling my friend saying go out side and look at the lights but my phone was freezing up which I thought was strange I tried calling 3 times but no answer?  I tried text-ing him still nothing so I turned off my phone and rebooted it then called he picked up saying: Yeah I am out side but I am not seeing any lights.  I then looked into the sky the there was 3 lights in a triangle and the other one was fading out I then ran inside to find a better camera ran back out side and they where gone?  The lights where Red-ish Orange lights I don't know what they where just that when I looked away they seemed to move a great distance when i looked back when I realized what I might be seeing I that's when I tried to get a camera but sadly everyone that did saw what I  with me just say it was Santa this Christmas eve and that's where they wont to leave it I would have been with then if it was not for that triangle before they disappeared and they where gone without any lights of an aircraft leaving the area that's when I was like something up?!   So I got on the internet looking up red lights in the sky and there the same thing I saw so don't really know what I saw but there was something there who knows it might have been Santa this night and that's what everyone else thought it was Rudolph and Satan's sleigh with some help I'll leave it at that.

Low, fast flying, round, very bright light, no sound, moving east to west over Boise Idaho.;2014-02-01 22:48:00;3 seconds;Low, fast flying, round, very bright light, no sound, moving east to west over Boise Idaho February 4, 2014 10:46 -10:48 pm I was sitting out side on my back patio, having a cigarette and talking to my husband on the phone, I caught a bright light out of the corner of my eye and watched a low flying very, very bright round object fly from east to west over my house, disappearing into the west, in the direction of  the desert area.   Way too fast to be a plane and had absolutely no sound.  Complete silence.  It was flying as low or lower than a plane coming into the air port for landing, but going in the opposite direction, toward  the West.  It did go in a straight line, not changing directions.  There was no smoke or light trail from it, it was an extremely bright light like a huge led light, but solid.  It was so bright like it was giving off its own light. The craft seamed to be picking up speed as it was going. 	The  time was approximately 10:48 pm.  I stayed outside for about 4 more minutes looking up and waiting to hear or see something else like an airplane or sound from the craft that  was catching up to it,  but it was still and quiet.  The sky was very clear.  I contemplated what I had just seen.  I am very, very sure of what I saw.  I am still shaking a little. I do not know if this has any relevance but as I was on the phone with my husband I tried to put the phone on speaker phone just seconds before I saw the object and the screen would turn black every time I brought my hand close to it.  This happened three times (with in just a few seconds) then the phone gave me a notice that the internet connection was unstable.  As I put the phone back to my head and told my husband that the internet was being weird  I saw the object coming over the house heading West. 	I did have my glasses on but as it passed I stood up and took a step off the patio to watch it as it disappeared flying into the west, so it was not a reflection in my glasses. 	I do not want people to think I am weird.  But I felt I needed to tell someone even if it is just logged somewhere that some one saw something in Boise on February 1 at very close to 10:48pm-ish in case some one else saw the same thing.

Right in the middle Vega and Arcturus was a bright circular light that looked like a planet but disappeared after only 20 minutes.;2016-08-06 21:30:00;~15-20 minutes;Right in the middle Vega and Arcturus was a bright circular light that looked like a planet but disappeared after only 20 minutes. This even took place August 6, 2016, at around 9:30 PM, just before dusk turned into night in Boise, Idaho.   It was a beautiful evening, and there wasn’t a cloud in the sky.  Mars and Saturn were visible in the southwest skies, along with Jupiter in the west, just below and to the right, of the crescent moon.  Vega and Arcturus were barely visible and directly above of us.  Right in the middle of those two stars was what I thought was Venus.   My wife was nearby and I showed her what I thought was a cool looking planet.  That’s how bright this circle in the dusk sky was and it looked like it was reflecting back the Suns light just like Venus does.   She told me, “Go get your phone and use your Sky app and see if it’s Venus for sure.”  I observed this for about 10-15 minutes and the object was STATIONARY the entire time and it appeared to be in outer space and not in our atmosphere.   I went inside and got my phone and when I came back outside and looked up the object was gone!  Naturally!  So in any event, I still fired up my Google Sky app pointed it up where the object was and that’s when I found out that Venus was on the horizon in the western sky and I just couldn’t see it because the tree tops were obstructing the view.  I’m VERY certain this wasn’t an unusually bright star that only appeared in the sky for about 20 minutes.  If this was a satellite, then it was as big or bigger than the ISS (which I have seen dozens of times flying overhead west to east) and it had some form of exotic propulsion system, or maybe the solar arrays changed location and were no longer reflecting back the light, rendering the object invisible, I don’t know.  This being my 4th UFO sighting tripped me out big time because i! f this was some type of UFO then it was absolutely gigantic, like maybe a huge mother ship.  I just hope someone else also noticed this anomaly.  I have looked in the same spot for the past couple of nights around the same and the object has never reappeared.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

UFO BOISE IDAhO 8/8/2020 between 8:30-9:30 p.m.;2020-08-08 20:30:00;60 minutes;UFO BOISE IDAhO 8/8/2020 between 8:30-9:30 p.m. We saw a stationary white object that looked round through our biloculars and it appeared to be catching the sun so it was very metallic and hard to tell what it was.   After 15 minutes of it not moving, we got out our more powerful spotting scope out and was able to zoom in on the object very clearly.    It was semi round and had two rows of lights.   The lights started at the top left and right and curved down towards the bottom.   Very distinctively.  We called our neighbor over to see if he had seen anything like it and he was surprised at the clarity and unusual object.   It was very distinctive that the lights on it was not sun reflections as the sun went down and it was very clear.   We are in SE Boise Idaho and sitting on our patio, which faced North.    once it was dark, it disappeared.    We observed it for a good hour,    We had also called the local news station, Channel 7 and left a recording around 9:00 pm hoping to see if further equipment might be able to zoom in closer.  We hav t heard back, nothing on the 10:00 news so we will see if anything further develops tomorrow.     We did not have the ability to take a picture of the zoomed in object clearly defined thru the spotting scope, unfortunately, but we could definitely draw it.   The object was less  clear through binoculars and only looked like a round metallic object, reflected by the sun.   it was just a tiny stationary white object in the sky by naked eye.   The spotting scope was amazingly telling as to what we were seeing.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
