Repeated sightings.;2006-02-18 03:32:00;2 minutes;Repeated sightings. This is the third time I have witnessed this craft. It had the exact same flight pattern in the same area as my last sighting a few months prior, but at a different time. First off in the distance it looked like a flashing star, but the movement was surreal. It was moving wild and zigzagging. At this point it has a very strange and eerie sound... a vibration type noise like wubwubwubwub. As it got closer into view it revealed the same red blinking light on its black frame as i observed in the previous sighting. But also as it came close into view the eerie sound faded and was gone and gracefully glid in the air and off into the distance.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

I saw a strobing red light above me and assumed it was an aircraft. It appeared to be quite high and I listened for some type of aircraft noise,but none came. It was moving from  East, Southeast  to the West. As it pass overhead , I could see three lights at it's front and still assumed it was an aircraft. But, as it passed, I could then , curuiously see a row of lights just aways behind it and some faint lights interspersed in between indicating a rectangular shape that was longer than it was wide. There was no noise and a very even speed.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

The whole object was reflective and looked metallic, almost like it was completely made out of metal.  I didn't think anything of it so I went to check my phone.  When I looked back into the sky after realizing what I may have just seen, it was no where in sight.  I searched for it in the sky the entire cab ride but it never showed back up..;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
