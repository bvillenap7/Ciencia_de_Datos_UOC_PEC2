Two redish lights moving together, quickly, without sound in a West to East manner.;1999-03-17 19:55:00;10 seconds;Two redish lights moving together, quickly, without sound in a West to East manner. We were viewing Jupiter and my daughter pointed out something she saw in the NW sky.  I observed two redish lights, not very bright, moving together.  One was above the other and they moved from West to East (generally).  They seemed to be darting slightly and their path was not a perfectly straight line.  They seemed to be moving very quickly and covered 90 degrees or so in less than five or six seconds.  There was absolutely no noise whatsoever. There were no aircraft in the vicinity.  My daughter's first impression was that she was seeing moths, as she described the motion as fluttering.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

Movements were evasive in nature, random ziz zaging and spiralling in space and still remain motionless.  They could change colors, would also blink on and off.  One appeared to shoot a light from the object and appeared to be red and dotted across the sky. The object was too high up for physical description.  The lights would blink, change in color from reddish to blue.  One appeared like it had a hallo surrounding it.  There movement was like a chess game in it's movement nature. They would zig zag and move in circular motion. ((NUFORC Note:  We received no other reports about this incident.));43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
This all happened very fast, it seemed like 3 seconds but when I went back in, it was ten minutes.;2003-12-10 22:00:00;10 minutes;This all happened very fast, it seemed like 3 seconds but when I went back in, it was ten minutes. There were 5 huge things in the night sky as I looked out my window. They were blood red with 6 black spots each. Their shape was weird, it was like a triangle but the sides were bent and had three sharp-looking points. They zig-zagged around mostly, but at one point, it was as if they sensed my gaze because they shot a ball of flame at my grass. The confusing thing about the ball of flame was that it extinguished as soon as they hit. When I went down to look at the spot, there was a brass-looking ball of metal there. Then I looked back up, and one of them was right above me. They shot a beam of light or something like that at the ball and it vanished. I touched the beam of light when it was there, which was for about 3 seconds, and it felt weird, silky and yet it had a hard feeling to it. Up close, I could see a window in the thing. There was a blue humanoid looking creature looking at me for about 2 seconds and then the thing flew back up and disappeared. The others were gone when the thing in the sky flew back up.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

LARGE FAST DISC REPORTED TO MHAFB YEARS AGO;2006-06-19 12:00:00;5-10 minutes;LARGE FAST DISC REPORTED TO MHAFB YEARS AGO A large object viewed from 2nd floor lunchroom at St.alphonsus hospital during bright daylight lunch hour. Witnessed by lab personel as well as 3 physicians and nurses. About 15 witnesses in all. The flying object entered from southeast at rapid rate and came to immediate stop over the city of Boise. It appeared to be at the same altitude that we were watching from, which was probably 2 0r 3 hundred feet higher that downtown area. From our position it appeared to be directly over the State Capitol. From our position, one could not determine its exact shape, because we had mostly a side view. It would be like looking at a disc from its side view. Its height to widith ratio would be like 1 to 300. It appeared to be either metallic or glasslike in nature. I was much longer than any commercial aircraft. It refracted colors sequentially along its entire width, and looked like how windows look from a distance when sunlite refracts off their surface. When it departed, it instantly accelerated at a phenonmenal speed and disappered over Bogus Basin to the north of Boise, about 20 miles from the city. It had no gas trail, and of course we were too far from the object to determine if there was any noise. The peculiar fact was there was nothing in the local news after the event. I was asked to call airport and see if they had it on radar.  I walked over to the lunchroom checkout counter and used the public phone and called the Boise tower. I was given a UFO report number at Mountain Home air force base and made the call. I cannot recall to whom I spoke, but it was an officer, and he was anxious to receive all the information. After speaking with him for about 5-10 minutes, and answering all his questions, I asked him he he could confirm this sighting. He replied, that they had picked up the object somewhere south of Salt Lake City and had lost it as it moved toward the North Pole. He also willing told me that the object's speed was in excess of 6500 miles per hour. He said that the airforce had nothing in its arsenal near that speed. he thanked me and I have never told this story to the public before.

My brother woke me up sometime after 1:00 AM to show me a weird light in the sky.   I walked out of my room and looked at what he was pointing at.  There were 3 lights on what looked like one large craft.  It was just hovering there for about 10 minutes.  One of the lights in the center started blinking.  It then went down in a slant towards the East. I obtained 2 pictures and two videos.  I currently have them on my computer.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

I picked up cell phone and started taking photos.  The (star).. then changed and suddenly I saw three little lights next to what I'm going to say was an orb and I did get photos of this and it is pretty hot in this star just disappeared so I don't think it was a rising star at all or maybe it was pretending to be a star but I looked up on the internet and there's no rising stars are planets of any kind of this time. The objects seemed to pulse over and then move and then once again pulse have a hover and move quickly I mean quickly quickly quickly..that is my story and I'm going to stick to it;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
White light over Boise.  Was this a ufo?;2015-10-26 18:00:00;3 minutes;White light over Boise.  Was this a ufo? I was sitting looking out my living room window, and I noticed a star.  I thought it was strange because it really was still to early for the stars to be out.   I sat watching for awhile and then I thought it might be moving to the left.  Sure enough it was.  I watched it then move to the right.   My friend came over and asked what I was staring at.  We watched, laughing and pointing at it.  We still didn't think it was a ufo.   Then suddenly a super bright light flashed towards us.  My friend freaked out and ran out the door and said she didn't want to be here.  I went after her, and as I turned to go I saw this light take a 90 degree turn and I saw just a portion of the craft.   It was lit inside and out.  Outside the shell was softly lit all over.  It had large windows from top to bottom.  The windows were rectangle with rounded corners.  I saw no life.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Three black objects spotted rising south into the evening sky.;2016-06-04 20:00:00;20 minutes;Three black objects spotted rising south into the evening sky. Myself, and at least ten other witnesses, observed one large, amorphous-shaped, ufo and two smaller objects slowly rising into the evening sky.  They were first seen rising over the top of the house myself and the other observers were gathered at.  We were all positioned in the backyard, looking to the south.   One person pointed them out, then everyone watched for what was ultimately about 20 minutes.  The objects appeared to be completely black, though the large one had what looked to be lighting of some kind on one side, but it was difficult to say definitively, as they were quite a distance away when this was noticed by one observer.   Nobody filmed them, though I don't know if it would have mattered anyway - on footage they would have just looked like black specs.  The movements of the craft were strange.  They didn't float away like a balloon, but rather they appeared to rise in a slow, deliberate manner, in a fixed direction to the south, with their distance increasing simultaneously with their height.   There was no sound associated with the craft that we noticed.  At first there were two smaller objects, one positioned somewhat close below, and the other just below the that.  The third, lowest of the three, seemed to move off to the East, and was quickly lost sight of.   The other two, however, remained in view of myself and the other witness for quite some time.  The craft stayed the same distance from each other for the duration of their movements, and never seemed to deviate.   Eventually the objects rose so high that it was not possible to see them anymore, and everyone went back to what they were doing.   It was really bizarre, and I would love to know if anyone else saw them, because at one point they had to have been very close to the ground if they were continuously rising in the manner we first saw them.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Low flying, small, lanternish look. No sound.;2016-07-04 22:00:00;10 seconds;Low flying, small, lanternish look. No sound. We were in the backyard after sunset but before it was dark. Watching the neighborhoods' mortar display. Saw the object travelling from north to south over the backyards of the houses on S Acacia. It was travelling in a very straight line at a slowish speed, maybe 30mph.  It made no sound at all.  It was only maybe 200 feet up, probably less. At first I thought some sort of lantern.  It had an orangish light within it.  The shape and build was indiscernible. It was most definitely not bright.  It was not very big, maybe the size of a medium to large cooler. We watched it continue in that very straight line south until we could not see it against the sky any longer. Definitely can't explain what it was.  If it was a drone I would expect some noise.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

Looking out window and above the black Boise horizon, I was watching a white light noticeably bright.  Didn't think much of it.   Went downstairs and came back 10 mins. later to find it was still there. I stared at it for maybe another five minute and then it cast.  VERY bright light for a couple seconds then eventually started moving seemingly away from my standpoint and disappeared.  There were other planes and noticeable helicopters in the area at the time of the event as well.   I don't even pay attention or really believe this could happen, but I was honestly spooked.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

Bright white light moving intermittently in the Boise sky with green and red light.;2020-04-07 21:45:00;1 hour;Bright white light moving intermittently in the Boise sky with green and red light. Two nights in a row I have seen a bright white light which appears to be blinking, pulsating.  It also appears to have a green and red light component which blinks.  It's movement is mostly further up in the sky and slightly westward but is not smooth, instead appears to move intermittently, travelling very short distances.  The light was first seen yesterday and was slightly (~1-2 degrees?) east of its position.  Looking north, the light was 2-3 degrees off due north from south Boise.  I did not hear anything out of the ordinary while watching it. I watched it appear to ascend for at least 1.5 hours.  There appeared to be an intermittent faint red beam from the center of the light.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Three Amber Lights over Boise, Idaho.;2020-05-19 23:30:00;<1 minute;Three Amber Lights over Boise, Idaho. I was walking home from a friend's house when I saw three amber lights in the sky flying towards the Mountains, northwest of Boise near Bogus Basin . The three lights flew in perfect formation in the shape of a triangle.  I do not believe this can be accredited to a flare or other earthly aircraft as the perfect formation in which they flew.  I am a skeptic and this is really scaring me.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
