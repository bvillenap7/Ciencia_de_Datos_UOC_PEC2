Huge triangle shaped object seen hovering over Boise Idaho;1996-01-07 17:00:00;4-5 minutes;Huge triangle shaped object seen hovering over Boise Idaho After an afternoon of shopping at the Boise mall, we were just getting on the West on ramp of the freeway for our trip home when I saw much brighter than normal lighting approaching from the South. As a retired USAF aircraft maintenance man I assumed that I was seeing landing lights since we were near the airport, however, they were more intense than I had ever seen and within 30 seconds or so, were near enough that I could distinguish 6 individual lights across the front. We had pulled onto the shoulder as had 2 other cars and were watching as the straight line of lights stopped and the object turned up at an angle and then we could make out a full 3D of a triangle shape that appeared to be larger than a football field. No sounds were heard from the object, however, the radio station I had the car radio set to inexplicably changed on its own to a different station. My wife was telling me to stop totally so she could get a better look, but instead I stepped on the gas and got the heck out of there as did the other 2 cars. To this day, I was nervous about mentioning this case to anyone and have advised my wife to not mention it either. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
A rapidly moving shimmering shadow with orange leading edges;2003-05-28 23:00:00;10 seconds;A rapidly moving shimmering shadow with orange leading edges I observed a rapidly moving craft, with a triangular leading edge (in the direction of motion). The trailing edges were more difficult to see, because while the leading edge glowed a dim orange color, the trailing body shimmered as if shedding a large quantity of heat, sort of like a mirage. A good description of the overall effect is shimmering shadow that moved across the sky. It traveled in a straight line, with it's leading edge spanning about 1 degree of arc (as estimated by comparison with a thumb's width at arm's length, and traveled about 75 to 90 degrees of arc in about 8 to 10 seconds. I have observed many satellites and meteors in this same location and this looked nothing like anything I have ever seen before. It was not just a point of light - it had physical extent and no navigation lights. I noticed no sound associated with the craft.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

There are recurring crafts hovering and flying over boise that are not of this world.;2010-08-12 12:30:00;40 minutes and counting;There are reoccuring crafts hovering and flying over boise that are not of this world. I have been seeing reoccurances of odd crafts high in the sky at night over Boise over the past month.  There's one craft that I mainly see up there cruising around changing directions in a way that a plane could not, the craft is also illuminating red, blue, and green flashing lights.  Tonight as I was watching this craft another craft flew directly over my apartment to high to make out the size.  I live near the airport so I am familiar of airplanes and this was not an airplane.  This craft was v shaped with red lights on the bottom.   It looked like it was at the height of a plane but made no sound, I watched to see if it descended to the airport which it did not.  The craft instead moved higher into the sky at an angle until it was gone.  There is some serious activity going on in the skies above Boise lately and it seems to now be a reoccuring thing.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

Last night I saw the classic triangle UFO traveling north over Chinden and Cloverdale area.  It was approximately eight whitish lights in a triangle formation appearing at first to be a single triangle shaped craft but then the lights shifted making it look more like the lights were independent traveling in a triangular formation, I'm not sure which.  It went over my head dead silent at an altitude of about 500 feet I would estimate.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
I saw was a huge translucent/dark looking triangle shaped craft.;2014-04-26 19:00:00;1 minute;On April 26, 2014, I was driving home through the city after running errands, as I was getting close to the freeway on ramp, a light in the sky out my driver window caught my eye, I immediately pulled over into a gas station parking lot and ran behind the store to get a better view,  the first thing I saw was a huge translucent/dark looking triangle shaped craft flying flat part first with two red lights and one white light on each corner, the white light was steady and the red lights strobed.  The second i saw it, the white light dimmed to nothing and the red lights stayed and the entire triangle shape morphed into the shape of a plane and i started to hear a  plane engine noise.  It looked like it was flying very low to the ground, away from the city towards the north east.  After maybe 5 seconds I lost sight of it over some trees and then proceeded to notice 3 bright white orbs above me, pretty close to the ground but above the altitude of the triangle craft,  one of them stayed stationary and the other two silently moved away in opposing directions,   After another few minutes of waiting to see something more, I got back in my car and finished driving home,  upon pulling into my drive way some 20 minutes later, I saw another white orb silently flying high in their typical spuddery zig zag stop and go motions.  First triangle shaped craft I've seen, mostly just orbs.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Green and red lights in an triangle shape over Walmart of Eagle Road and Fairview in Boise, Idaho.;2015-01-24 18:00:00;20 minutes;Green and red lights in an triangle shape over Walmart of Eagle Road and Fairview in Boise, Idaho. I was driving south on eagle rd about 6:30, when I stopped for a stop light at McMillan rd.  I looked up to the right of the rd and a bright light was very visible.  Being a pilot I noticed there was something different about this object.   As i looked at it still at the stop light i could clearly see 3 green lights forming a triangle shape and on one side there were 3 red lights in a row - with some bright white lite from the center.  I made a right hand turn onto E McMillan Rd and pulled into Charles F. McDevitt Youth Complex parking lot to get a better look.   I got out of my car to observe the lights.  At first they were completely stationary - no movement - also no sound.  The lights would slowly move either left or right and then stop and be perfectly still - zero movement.  I was looking south west towards the Eagle Walmart.   Elevation maybe 1200 to 1500 - almost in the final approach line to Boise airport.   Suddenly, it decended at about a 45 degrees downward away from me in a matter a few seconds into a populated area around I-84.   I then drove down Eagle Road, heading south towards Fairview Ave., and never did see it again.   The entire observation took about 20 minutes. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) I just uploaded a report from boise idaho - i put the date as 1/24/14 but can you correct it to 1/24/15 - thanks - ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM));43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

Dancing disc zig-zags through the sky.;2016-02-02 01:15:00;~1 minute;Dancing disc zig-zags through the sky. I was sitting in my backyard stargazing like I normally do.  UFO sightings, extraterrestrials, so forth, isn't the kind of stuff I generally occupy my time or mind with.  When I stargaze I expect maybe to see a couple shooting stars.   Well this time what I can only describe as a disc with three sets of triple lights in triangle arrangement flew overhead in zig-zag pattern.  The changes in direction were quite sharp without any apparent slowdown or difficulty.   I watched surprised but calmly as it did this a few times.  It was moving exceptionally quick, and it was high enough in the sky to be clear above any buildings, several hundred feet I would estimate, but it looked lower than most planes.   Anyway it did this dance for a few more zigs and zags before abruptly halting its forward direction and traveling straight upwards out of view. Very odd.  I doubt I'll ever know exactly what it was but one thing is for certain, the universe is a big place! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.

Two multicolored illuminated objects hovered above Boise and ascended vertically and vanishished out of site.  ((anonymous report));2017-04-15 21:30:00;5 minutes;Two multicolored illuminated objects hovered above Boise and ascended vertically and vanishished out of site. Between 9:00 and 10:00 pm Satuday, April 15, 2017, I was exiting a parking lot in SW Boise shopping center and saw a large multi-colored (redish white yellow) illuminated object hovering above the city.  Within a couple seconds the object ascended vertically until it became the size of pin-head and disappeared from sight. I noticed a second identical object ascendingo from lower altitude above the city as I pulled back in the parking lot and took photos with my cellphone.  It ascended and disappeared like the first one. Unfortunately, two bright parking lot lights are shown in the photos.  After examining one of the photos, two other unilluminated objects appear to be accompanying the illuminated object.
