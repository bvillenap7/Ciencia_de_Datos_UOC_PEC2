Fireball changes directions a stops in the sky.;2010-10-20 19:00:00;5 minutes;Fireball changes directions a stops in the sky. Around 7pm mountain time in Boise Idaho I was standing in a dirt parking lot with another person when something caught my attention in the sky is best described as a ball of fire. It came out of the middle of the sky it did not fall from the top. I though it was a airplane of fire or a meteor but it was moving at a moderate almost controlled speed then it made a very rounded turn to my left then slowed to a complete stop where it just sat and eventually faded. It left a very obvious trail of fire behind it and was very prominent against the horizon, the entire event was a full 5 minutes. I took to very good pictures, i am certain it was on fire.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Orange objects that looked like fireballs sighted in Boise then disappear.;2012-12-31 22:15:00;3 minutes;orange objects that looked like fireballs sighted in boise then disappear. On my way to pick up a friend near downtown Boise on New Year’s Eve at about 10:15 pm I spotted an orange fireball looking object.  The object did not seem to be moving,  I pointed it out to my girlfriend and roommate whom were both in the car and they stated it was just a plane.  I disagreed and told them to look at it, I told them that it was orange and I have never seen a plane that looks like that. I then stated it did not seem to be moving,  they then wondered what it was as well. My roommate then noticed about a minute after the initial sighting that it just completely disappeared we looked all over and could not see it at all in the sky.   About a minute later as we got closer to downtown Boise I then noticed five orange fireball objects in the sky, I thought maybe it was just lights from downtown then I noticed it was far too high in the air and the objects were in a zigzagged line going up.  These seemed to be slightly moving then all but one disappeared, about ten seconds later the last one disappeared as well.  I thought maybe the buildings could have been blocking my view but after we passed them there was nothing there.  The sky was clear with no clouds at all in that area.  I have no idea what these were but they were not planes and were far too high in the sky to be any type of lights.  They had me pretty creeped out, and I cannot seem to explain how we seen these objects twice and one was kind of far away from the other sighting.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

See video link to YouTube I shot a video of something burning up in the night sky in Boise , Id,   Monday night, june 3rd.  There were two objects, this was the second.

White ball of light traveling at high rate of speed vanishes over southern Boise, Idaho.;2013-10-17 20:45:00;5 seconds;White ball of light traveling at high rate of speed vanishes over southern Boise, Idaho. At approximately 20:45 last night as my husband watched TV he noticed a brilliant white ball of light drop from the sky through our half moon window above our fireplace. We watch planes approaching our airport through this window, but he said this object was different.  There were no flashing lights associated with this ball of light and it was brilliant white.  He said it was the brightest white light he's ever seen and it had no tail.  The object moved at a high rate of speed and dropped straight down and out of sight in the direction of South Boise. From my husband's vantage point it was the size of a baseball. After hearing that another person reported a UFO sighting in North Boise a few days ago, we wondered if others witnessed this white fireball.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
I saw a bright orange circular object that hovered then zoomed off, it resembled fire but with more solidity..;2014-09-21 22:40:00;2 minutes;I saw a bright orange circular object that hovered then zoomed off, it resembled fire but with more solidity.. September 21 2014 To whom it may concern,  	Last night at approximately 10:40 p.m. on Saturday September 20th 2014, I witnessed a circular object hovering above a building right outside my work place.  I had just clocked off from work and went outside to grab a change of clothes.  Four of my co-workers were outside smoking a cigarette. When I came out they were all staring up above the building directly across from the south side employee parking lot which was approximately 30 feet from where we were.  As I glanced up to see what they were looking at I was immediately shocked at what I saw, a bright orange circular ball. The object appeared to be the same height as a small aircraft but with a much brighter light. It was bright orange but not solid orange.  It had changing orange hues within the craft, similar to the movements of fire, except that it looked more solid then fire.  The center appeared to be changing from a darker orange to lighter orange.  The object hovered for about 30 seconds from the time I stepped outside to witness it.  After hovering the object took off at a very fast speed high up into the night sky. You could still see the faint orange ball traveling for about two minutes before completely disappearing.  At that point you wouldn’t have been able to differentiate it from a star. The best description I can give you is that it looked like a hovering fireball, however when it zoomed off there was no orange tracer like fire would leave.  Also, while the orange ball was hovering there was very slight horizontal movement from left to right.  My co-workers and I agree that it mostly resembled a floating fireball but with a solidity to it.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

Orange fireball in West Boise.  May have landed near Cole street. No noise,;2015-06-24 02:00:00;2 minutes;Orange fireball in West Boise.  May have landed near Cole street.  No noise, I didn’t actually see the UFO, it was my son.  He doesn’t want to report it.  It kind of freaked him out.  But I thought it should be reported.  He doesn’t know I’m doing this. My son couldn’t sleep on the night of 6/24/15, so he stepped outside and sat on the porch for a while.  It was a warm night. After a while he saw an orange fireball in the sky.  He thought it was a meteor at first. But it was coming down towards the house and slowing down.  It made no noise at all.  He watched as it got lower and lower and he lost sight of it when it was very, very close to the ground. There were big bushes between him and the craft.  He believes it landed because it was so low.  There’s an empty field behind his house and he thinks that’s where it landed.  He was too scared to stay out and watch. I asked him why he didn’t peek through the bushes and see, and he said he was too afraid.  I asked him if he could see people or anything inside the craft.  He said the light was too bright. The house I located in Boise on Cole Street.  The nearest cross street is Ustick.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205

On 4 Oct 2015 at 2145 hours we observed a bright fiery orange light in the southern sky above Boise, Idaho.  This object moved erratically as we observed it for 10 minutes.  It went north, then east, and then gained elevation until it appeared to vanish.  We also saw blinking lights from other aircraft that approached in the vicinity of the bright object.  The object looked much larger than the other aircraft passing over.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
Comet-like UFO.  ((NUFORC Note:  Re-entering space debris??  PD));2018-02-06 18:30:00;25 minutes;Comet-like UFO Looked like a comet but it was white.  Looked as though it was coming through some clouds but we did not have any clouds this evening.  I saw it while driving on my way home.  When I got home, my husband was outside looking at it.  It was over the sky in south east Boise.  It was high and then went low and disappeared.  No, it was not a plane.  It reminded us of a comet.  Very beautiful.  I tried to take a video with my cell phone but it was too dark to do so. ((NUFORC Note:  Possible result of launch of Space X rocket from Cape Kennedy?  PD));43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
I saw a “fireball”  brightening and dimming above the Boise foothills followed, by a shooting star above it in the sky;2019-08-02 03:40:00;30 seconds;I saw a “fireball”  brightening and dimming above the Boise foothills followed, by a shooting star above it in the sky Around 3:40am I was standing on my porch and out of the corner of my eye I saw a flash of orange light over the tree line coinciding with the Boise foothills.  For a moment I though it was a lighthouse just by how bright it was, obviously that’s impossible, it just gives you an idea of how forcefully bright this light was.  It resembled a ball of bright fire in one stationary place.  When I finally realized how strange it was and ruled out any other type of craft or car headlights, I kept staring and saw a very bright fire-like object light up after about 10 seconds of staring, it occured in the same place over what would be the Boise foothills.  It looked exactly like a flame except that it became very bright then dimmed until it disappeared.  Between its appearance and its disappearance during the sighting that I directly saw, I’d say it appeared for probably 3-4 seconds before dimming and completely disappearing.  The strange thing is (as if that wasn’t strange! enough) a shooting star occured directly after it burned out.  Both flashes were in the exact same spot and the shooting star was significantly higher in the sky.  The best way to explain it would be a circular or oblong, controlled orange/yellow/red fire in the sky.  Extremely bright.;43.6082645510839;-116.234624458205
