My daughter and her friend and I had just finished a little job we were working on and headed home. She said look mom a HUGE falling star  I looked out and told her to stop and we got out to watch it. I remember thinking that holy cow thats a huge meteor, and told the girls if it hits we are going to feel it. At that point it leveled off and slowed way down following a straight line directly south, actually slowing and hovering at times. The light seemed to fade and come back to very bright and after awhile it literally disappeared. Feeling like we had just witnessed something pretty strange we went on home.  The girls took off to go to a friends house and the called me and said its back!!!! I went to the front yard and there it was hovering over the southern end of town. It disappeared once more and we didn't see it again.  Needless to say, I didn't get much sleep.;44.4448;-116.7025
