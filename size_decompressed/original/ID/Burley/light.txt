Mystery disc seen from 50 or less feet away zooms off!!;2011-04-22 23:00:00;3 minutes;Mystery disc seen from 50 or less feet away zooms off!! Me and my wife were taking a late drive out in the country south of burley heading north.  We were approximately 3 mile south of the light when we noticed it.  It was basically straight ahead of us but slightly east above a house right next to the road.   It was a glowing single white light. when me and my wife first saw it we thought it was a bright toy rc type helicopter, but an extremely bright one, hovering maybe ten feet above the tree line.  But as we got closer we started to see the shadow of a disc shape about 25 feet across.   When we were about fifty feet from it it darted off at an unnatural speed north east headed to Pocatello, was maybe three seconds and it had darted over the entire horizon and was gone.  There was no sound whatsoever.  We pulled in at home and noticed three helicopters coming from the far east from Utah.  Have seen multiple UFOs in this valley maybe 25 miles south there is a mountain chain.  Completely surrounds south half.  To the north maybe 150 miles another mountain chain.  To east is 80 Miles to nearest town and to west 40 miles to nearest town.;42.5244;-113.7931
