6 separate yellowish spheres with 30 degree tail traveling south to north slowly not meteors no sound;1983-06-03 21:30:00;15 minutes;6 separate yellowish spheres with 30 degree tail traveling south to north slowly not meteors no sound June 3rd or 4th of 1983 with my fianc√© soon to be wife in Burley Idaho. I had set up my 8 inch reflector to observe Jupiter and around 9:30 to 10:00 PM was looking with eyes to the southeast and saw this bright slow moving object with a long tail moving to the northeast. Then, after that took 2 minutes to cross the far eastern horizon another object rose up in the SE but was further up in the sky. Over the next 15 minute period a total of 6 objects passed over us each one further west and a few minutes apart till the last one came directly over us and just like the rest had a bright 30 to 40 degree tail. Moving at the speed of a jet plane we look at it with the telescope with about sixty power and the main object thru the scope look like the rest of the tail with just a round front , same color, yellow, nothing ablating off of it and no sound of any sort.. I work for the FAA as ant ATC and check with NORAD on my next shift and there had been no reentri! es. The objects stayed the same brightness, color, shape and tail for the 3 to 4 minutes to travel from the horizon to horizon. A report from a sheriff in northern Nevada was in the paper and astronomy friends had heard reports about it.;42.5244;-113.7931
