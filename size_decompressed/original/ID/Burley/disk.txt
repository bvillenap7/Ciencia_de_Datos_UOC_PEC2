Disc shaped UFO sighted over Idaho;2010-07-20 21:15:00;5 seconds;Disc shaped UFO sighted over Idaho The sun was setting and the clouds were particularly beautiful so I went outside to take a few photographs.  I took a series of quick photographs and thought nothing more of it until I loaded them on my computer a few days later and noticed what appeared to be an orb in one photo and a disc in the other.   I believe the first photo captured the UFO as it was heading south and the second as it turned and headed west.   The UFO was flying northwest of Burley, Idaho at an estimated range of 20 miles.;42.5244;-113.7931
