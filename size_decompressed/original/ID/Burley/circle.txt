I was quizzical the 1st time I seen it and then it did a 45 turn to the left and then a 45 turn to the right and then came back to it's original course and then went up and disapeared. It's course was south to north. i kept watching and it came out of the east and went up and diapeared again. So I kept watching and this time it was a quick blip, in and out. Then it came out of the south and still traveling at this great speed { I would say about 5 times the speed of a commercial jet} it stopped and reversed course for 1/2 a second and went forward again and reversed again and then shot up and disapeared. I was visabley shaken, as I whole heartedly believe in ufo's but never expected to see one.;42.5244;-113.7931
