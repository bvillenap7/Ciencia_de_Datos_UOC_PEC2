A large panning light that would move from position to position faster than seemily possible.;1991-09-10 21:30:00;A half an hour;A large panning light that would move from position to position faster than seemily possible. A friend and I were discussing life issues at a local lake.  We were parked in my car talking when I kept seeing something flash/flicker out of the corner of my eye. I finally could not go on talking with her anymore and said what is that? as I turned my eyes up towards the sky. She had been noticing it too, but had yet to say anything. We both watched the light slowly pan around as if it was trying to find something similar to what one might see a helicopter do. There was no sound however and every so often it would move positions. It was very very quick when it did this....it took no longer than a snap of the finger to get what looked like many yards away from it's present position. We watched with curiosity, excitement and fear as it continued this for many minutes. I even went as far as flashing my car headlights out over the lake to perhaps get its attention, but never did. After a while it began to sink in to us what we were looking at and we decided to call it an evening. Fear drove us home as we left the object still panning its light down upon the ground....still speedily moving from one position to another…;46.3733631578947;-116.885168421053
Bright, steady white light with blue and red flashes;2003-11-21 22:05:00;20 minutes;Bright, steady white light with blue and red flashes Last Friday evening, November 21, 03, just after 10:00 p.m., my husband called to me from a room at the back of the house, You've got to come and see this.  He was looking out the window at a strange-looking light about 40 degrees up in the southeastern sky.  The weather was clear and cold.  The light was white and steady, the size of a very large star, several times the size of Mars during its close approach to Earth in late summer, and slightly to the west of where that planet had been visible in the night sky.  In addition to the white light, it was giving off rapidly alternating flashes of blue and red.  We went outdoors and watched for a few minutes, then I phoned the police to ask if anyone else had reported it.  No one had.  The dispatcher said she'd send an officer to the vicinity to check, and phone me back if he saw anything unusual.  I went back to the window, and the light was slightly smaller, as if it had moved away from us on a direct line.  I then had to deal with a sick cat, and when I looked again, half an hour later, the light was gone.  We've had some degree of cloud cover every night since, but last night we were able to determine that there are currently no bright stars in the area of the sky where we saw this light.  My husband did see a police car drive by that night, but our phone line was in use on the internet afterwards, and we didn't hear anything from the dispatcher.  I haven't phoned back.  This is a small city, and it's slightly embarrassing even to enquire with the police about such a thing.;46.3733631578947;-116.885168421053

My att;2007-07-01 21:55:00;5 minutes;I was walking back from my shop to my house and looked up.  The sky was partly overcast, but no rain, a few stars were visible.  My attention was drawn to an orange/red light coming from the northeast, heading southwest.  It was moving fairly slow, and was below the cloud cover.  There was no visible flashing of the light that I could see, just a steady orang/red glow.  I listened for the sound of jet or prop driven plane, but could not hear any noise. I called my wife using my cell phone and asked her to come outside.  That was at 21:55 PST.  My wife came outside and just after she did, the object stopped moving.  It remained stationary for roughly a minute.  My wife went to find our digital camera.  The object started moving again, a bit slower than before, but now it had changed it's direction slightly, now heading more south. By this time, my 13 year old daughter had come outside as well and watched as the light continued south.  We finally lost sight of it as it went into the cloud cover.  At no time did we ever hear any noise coming from the light, even after it has passed over us.;46.3733631578947;-116.885168421053
Fast traveling bright light that appeared and disappeared in less than 30 seconds.;2011-07-23 23:00:00;less than 30 seconds;Fast traveling bright light that appeared and disappeared in less than 30 seconds. At approximately 11:00 pm PST sitting on our deck overlooking the town in a completely clear and cloudless night sky we noticed a very bright white light over the LC Valley in the far distance to the east.  I would describe it, as almost a flash of light wasn’t there previously, so naturally it caught our definite attention.    So we looked directly at it and for a few seconds as it very quickly got brighter and much bigger, like it was moving directly towards us, then in the  very same moment just as we were discussing how it was getting brighter way too fast to be a plane,  It just as quickly got smaller, dimmed, and disappeared like it was traveling away from us moving directly the same direction it had came.  This all occurred within a duration of less than 30 seconds.  About a few moments after we witnessed this object in the sky we heard a loud boom, which would be described as similar if not identical to that of a sonic boom, which we thought to be really curious.  Now  If this was some sort of aircraft it changed direction way to abruptly to be that of any aircraft known possible.   And it also appeared and disappeared way too quickly, that it had to be traveling at extremely high speed.  It came and left without a trace.;46.3733631578947;-116.885168421053
Moving satellite looking light with a visible toroidal energy ring.;2016-02-10 05:20:00;6 minutes;Moving satellite looking light with a visible toroidal energy ring. I was out delivering papers at 5:20 a.m. pacific standard time in Lewiston, Idaho today February 10, 2016. I happened to look above me as something caught my eye moving across the sky.  At first, glance I knew it was something incredible that I had never seen before.  The size, shape and color of light it produced looked as though it was a satellite like so many I had seen before moving across the night sky but it was very apparent that it was not.  The reason being is that this light producing object had a very distinct ring around it.  The ring could be described as something like a bubble, halo or a type of force field around it.   The longer I watched it the more interesting things got.  The movement seemed to slow and as it did, the ring became larger and larger until it seemed to dissipate except for the right side that looked as though it was shooting air or some kind of gas from within the object.   The only conclusion I came up with is that it was some sort of toroidal or merkabah vehicle where I was seeing the energy being created by the craft shoot out and surround itself with it.  Very fascinating it was!!;46.3733631578947;-116.885168421053
