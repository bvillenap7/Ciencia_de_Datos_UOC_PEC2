Triangular craft hovering over bridge then moving downriver.;1994-02-10 23:55:00;5 minutes;Triangular craft hovering over bridge then moving downriver. In 1994 I was coming home from my job as a registered nurse.  I was driving on Idaho highway #3/12 near what is known as the Arrow Junction. I noticed lights about 1/2 mile ahead of me that appeared to be stationary and located on the side of the river valley.  The night was very overcast with no stars or moonlight visible.  I thought for a moment that someone must have installed new lighting on the outside of their house because there are many new homes in that area.  As I approached the bridge, however, I saw that the lights were moving down the river towards me.  The lights turned into a triangular shaped aircraft that was probably about 150-200 feet above the river's surface.  It was moving very slowly downriver, over the center of the water.  I assume that the craft was triangular because the lights that were shining down were in a triangular pattern like this: 0 <--front of craft Lights--->   0 0 0 0 0  <--rotating beacons between these lights I think that there were only 5 lights on the craft, but I don't remember for sure.  There were two rotating beacons in between the last three lights.  This struck me as odd because most aircraft marker lights that I'm aware of nowdays are strobe-type lights.  Another odd thing was that this really large aircraft seemed to be proceeding at a terribly slow rate of speed.  It seems to me that it must have had to have been a helicopter because the forward speed was so slow.  The lights were all white, even the rotating lights.  Since the sky was overcast and totally dark, I couldn't make out the actual form of the craft.  I always said that if I ever saw a UFO I would stop, get out, and watch it.  But this was so different than anything I've ever seen before that I could not bring myself to stop and get out of my rig.  I do not have an estimate of the physical size of the craft although it was very big.  I used to be a paratrooper and was in Viet Nam so I am familiar with a lot of the military's aircraft and I can say that I haven't a clue as to what this thing was, other than it was big and slow.  The second witness referred to above was another nurse who was driving her car ahead of mine.  The Arrow Bridge is at the intersection that we both took to get home and when I talked to her the next evening at work she said she saw the aircraft and that it appeared to be hovering directly over the bridge when she turned to get on the highway that would take her home.  This correlates with what I saw because I could see her car ahead of mine, turning on the bridge about 1/2-3/4 mile ahead of me and the lights at that time were directly over the bridge and appeared to be stationary.  She had no other information to add about what the thing looked like.  The aircraft passed by me and I continued to the bridge, then made the same turn that the other nurse made and continued home. Additional: The lights had the same brilliance and color of airplane landing lights.  I don't remember any other unusual factors about the lights other than that they were very white and very bright.;46.3733631578947;-116.885168421053
3 sets of  lights (changing color) in a triangle formation moving slowly over Lewiston valley.;2006-05-09 23:40:00;10+minutes;3 sets of  lights (changing color) in a triangle formation moving slowly over Lewiston valley. On the way to work noticed 3 sets of unfamilier looking lights moving slowly over valley W/NW (towards Moscow),they formed a triangle formation . I stopped my vehicle and got out to get a better look. It was hazy and the ambiant light from valley was making it hard to see any detail other than the lights that were changing color constantly. I got the feeling it was one object at the time but was not sure ,I could not see any mass between the lights. The sets of lights appeared the same color with a white center light changing to a light but bright blue, with what apeared to be rotating or flasing lights around it (they were changing from red ,green, yellow ).I got back in my vehicle and headed on to work , this was the same general direction the lights were moving. I parked my vehicle and walked to a wall that blocked a lot of the light surround my work facility.  I again could see the lights which had moved on farther towards Moscow (and above the Snake River Canyon). The perspective of the lights seemed to change but it was from the greater distance (I still believe it was a triangle shaped object but at a greater distance from me). The distance was greater and so was the haze but the direction of the object changed slightly as almost following the river. For a moment I thought the lights broke formation or atleast changed formation but I think it was the object changing dirrection. I watched as the lights faded out in the haze and lights .Just before it faded out I was able to guess altitude at about the same as the top of the Snake River canyon . The object was first seen by me just past and above the Lewiston airport(west) and was last seen above the Snake River past the port facilities that are on the north side of river and west of Lewiston. In 10 plus minutes the object moved about 10 miles in around 10 minutes at best.      I had not reported this until reading report of students sighting in Moscow just over an hour later, it seemed that the sightings might relate????;46.3733631578947;-116.885168421053
Three delta, possibly bat-shaped objects observed flying due west between 10,000 and 25,000 feet at very high rate of speed.;2011-07-17 13:00:00;20 minutes;Three delta, possibly bat-shaped objects observed flying due west between 10,000 and 25,000 feet at very high rate of speed. I observed three delta (the largest was possibly bat-shaped) objects flying due west between 10,000 and 25,000 feet at very high rate of speed.   My wife also witnessed the third and largest object.  The objects moved at least five times faster than commecial air liners also flying in the area.  The objects were not flying in formation, but rather appeared individually.  I noticed each object in turn as it flew overhead and I followed it until it was too distance to view (approximately 20 degrees from the west horizon).  Each object travelled from directly overhead to out of sight in no more than 25 seconds.  The third object, the largest, returned (from east to west) approximately 25 minutes after it was initially observed.  There was no trail behind any of the objects and I was unable to detect any sound from the object.  A large military aircraft began circling shortly after I observed the first object.;46.3733631578947;-116.885168421053
