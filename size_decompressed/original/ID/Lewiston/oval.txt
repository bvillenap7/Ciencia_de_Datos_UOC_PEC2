We watched the object turn into three black dots, then into a cloud, then back into one large dot. The object appeared to transform into three small dots, going to horizontal, then vertical shape. The objects then went back into the large dot again. While watching the object, I looked up at the tower and observed the control tower personnel also looking into the direction of he object. They were watching with a very large pair of binoculars. Approximately 10 minaues into watching the object. Two small planes landed from different locations. the object then faded out and was not seen after that;46.3733631578947;-116.885168421053
