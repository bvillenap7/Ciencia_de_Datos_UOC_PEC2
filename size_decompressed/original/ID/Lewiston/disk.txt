The buzzing.;2016-08-12 01:00:00;5 minutes;I feel I should report what I experienced even if I believe it was a lucid dream. Few years  ago I woke up one night to an intense buzzing like everything was vibrating and a other worldly blueish white light. I walked to the front door looked out the window and seen 3 crafts stationary.1st was 3-4 feet off the ground 2nd 20ish feet and the 3rd was 40-50 feet up. I was overcome with fear I pounded on the wall to my neighbor while yelling but there was no sound but the buzzing. I grabbed a knife thought to myself don't open the door but couldn't stop from doing it . As soon a I touched the door knob I woke up in bed confused. I asked my neighbor if he heard me pound on the wall he said no. The crafts looked to small to be piloted but I did feel a presence.;46.3733631578947;-116.885168421053
