It could have been about 45 degrees up in relation to my position.  It made no visible movements. I was on the Idaho side of the river, while this object was across the river or on the Washington state side. After what may have been around thirty-seconds, or thereabouts, the object shot off, slightly to my right and up.  It moved so quickly that is was not visible within a couple of seconds. I have never seen any object move as fast as this except in movies.;46.3733631578947;-116.885168421053
