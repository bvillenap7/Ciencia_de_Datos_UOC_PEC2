3 circles slowly moving across the sky in unison;2012-06-29 08:50:00;2 minutes;3 circles slowly moving across the sky in unison Local airport is 1 mile south of my office complex.  As usual I was watching aircraft land while talking to a customer on the phone.   I then noticed an odd bright reflection in the air over a mountain about 20 miles south of town. It appeared that the morning sun was reflecting just perfectly off an aircraft.  But, as the craft travelled northwest the bright reflection dulled and I could clearly see 3 distinct circular objects traveling well under the commercial aircraft lanes.    I told the person I was on the phone with what I was looking at with the typical &quotwhatever&quot answer!  I told a coworker to take a look.  She then grabbed a pair of binoculars and looked at the craft.  She said the 3 circles are all connected and that we were looking at a satellite.  I laughed because the craft was maybe 10-15 thousand feet up and wasn't descending it was moving slowly and smoothly across the sky.  I grabbed my phone and tried to record it but by the time I trie! d to zoom in it was out of view.  I'm a former USAF and federal agent and I've seen thousands of aircraft.  This wasn't convential!;42.5555;-113.7764
Triangle shaped craft flying at high altitude and speed.;2013-08-17 23:00:00;2 minutes;Triangle shaped craft flying at high altitude and speed. It was flying Northwest to Southwest. It looked like it was flying from the Mountain Home AFB to Utah at first. It flew quite slow and High in the air then it appeared to turn North and towards space.  The lights dimmed as it flew off and it was gone in the blink of an eye.  From my vantage point he was flying through the Big Dipper in the sky and turned near the North Star.  I've never seen anything like this before.  It was not any kind of aircraft since they couldn't turn and fly higher that quickly nor would they turn off their lights in our airspace.  We live a mile from an airport.;42.5555;-113.7764
