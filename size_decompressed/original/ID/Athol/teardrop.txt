high polished chrome-teardrop shaped object hovering over a busy North Idaho Hi-way in mid afternoon;2002-10-01 15:00:00;3-5 min.;high polished chrome-teardrop shaped object hovering over a busy North Idaho Hi-way in mid afternoon As my daughter and I were driving from our home just north of Athol Idaho,to do some shopping in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho we noticed something above the hiway. Time aproximately 3pm and the date was somewhere between late winter of 2002 and early spring of 2003.  It was a bright beautiful afternoon. We were driving south on hiway 95 and we were just about {either just before or just after the county line}  The hiway is two lanes heading to the south and one lane heading to the north.  It is a rural area and the hiway is lined with tall trees and farm land on either side.  We were a[pox. 4 miles north of them small town of Athol.  As we rounded a bend to the left-hanging in the sky at just about tree top heigth was something unusual.  It was not moving.  And it didn't make a sound.  It just hung there.  It was long enough to stretch from one side of the hiway{3 lanes} to the other.At tree top heigth. Not moving and totally silent.  It was tear drop shaped and seemed to be a high polished chrome color. No windows were visible. And there were no wings. It cast a hugew shadow on the ground in which our carm passed through.  As we reacherd the other side we could see other cars veering off the road so I know we were not alone in this sighting.  As we looked back after passing through the shadow we couyld see nothing...as if it had never been there at all...We heard nothing as it left.  At first we hadm a hard time admitting even to ourselves what we had seen.  But we know by the other cars pulled off the road, we were not alone. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.
