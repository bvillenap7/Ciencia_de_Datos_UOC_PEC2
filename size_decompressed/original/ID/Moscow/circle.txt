3 floating figures in sky shaped and looked like a fire ball, but disappeared.;2013-07-01 22:33:00;3 minutes;3 floating figures in sky shaped and looked like a fire ball, but disappeared My husband and I were standing on the porch smoking and from behind him to the left I see this big circle shaped like a ball and so orange it looked like a ball of fire, an I said what the heck is that...   He said it was helicopter and I said there was no way because there was no sounds.  Watched it for about 30 secondds than I ran inside to grab my camera and as i came out i watched it just fade away.   So i took phone/camera back inside and plugged it in not even second later i turn around and I can see another one.  It was lower and closer but got further away and then came back towards me disappearing again…  I did catch this one on my camera, but it was wierd cause this one was more to the right of me over the hill and as I was recording it my husband points out another one at the top of our trailer court..

8 objects that began as “falling stars” whitish in color all perfectly aligned and spaced apart.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-28 19:57:00;12 minutes;8 objects that began as “falling stars” whitish in color all perfectly aligned and spaced apart were observed My wife and I were walking at 19:57 hours, admiring the crescent moon and Venus when I noticed what appeared to be a falling star glowing very white, however as it appeared to come into the atmosphere it stopped glowing and then began to look like a satellite in low orbit. It entered the sky from the southwest and was going northeast. After watching it for almost a minute and not observing any red or green lights typical of aircraft, we noticed another “falling star” that appeared to be coming into the atmosphere. It was another object exactly the same shape and color (whitish like Venus) and following the first object in the same path. After another minute or so, we noticed another “falling star” (ie lit up the surrounding sky in white light). This continued until we counted 8 objects in total. All equally spaced apart except the 8th object, which was a little farther back in distance. After the fourth one, I called my son and had him step out on his back p! orch, and he observed the final four objects come “into the atmosphere”. We heard no sounds or nor saw any other color lights. They did not blink, just displayed a whitish color until they disappeared in the northeast sky.;46.733090079365;-116.990001587302
