Moscow, ID-Row of 5-6 off white lights moving silently & slowly east to west summer 93.;1993-07-15 22:00:00;3 minutes;Moscow, ID-Row of 5-6 off white lights moving silently & slowly east to west summer 93. I have finally decided to post this sighting after years of debate and finally choosing your site as a safe place to record this information.  Hopefully, others will file their report as well. My friends and I were having a BBQ in the backyard of my friends house during what i remember sometime in July of 1993.  I heard someone say, 'look up' and to my amazement I saw a row or a line of 5-6 off white lights, that would change to red, blue, green colors in a non-synchronized way.  This line of lights were closely linked together at roughly 1,000 ft above the Palouse on the edge of Moscow, ID about 1-2 miles from my position moving silently & slowly East to West.  At first, I thought what I was seeing was a very large plane with lights arranged along the wings but then i realized that planes would not be moving so slowly and I also heard no sound whatsoever. We saw a series of ~5-6 lights lined up in an edge straight row at what i would estimate around 1,000 feet above ground. The lights moved in unison, silent and moving slowly from East to West. It also appeared that the line of lights rotated together slightly around on a center axis as the entire object headed West. It had a slight aura and very subtle vibration as it moved over the town of Moscow to the West.  My friends and I saw this but we didn't contact anyone because we didn't know who to contact. It is possible that it could of been a military craft but my friends and I saw something very unusual indeed. I hope that this information is somehow useful.

Bright,strobe-like colorful lights, high in SW sky, no sound, followed by orange dripping from sight of light.  ((Meteor));2008-02-19 05:30:00;45 seconds;bright,strobe-like colorful lights, high in SW sky, no sound, followed by orange dripping from sight of light At approximately  5:30 am, while walking with my sister,  there was a very bright, strobing light in the southwest sky.  It was just near or above the top of the trees in the park , just above the childrenâ€™s play structure.  The flashing or strobing light was similar to a police car light except the light thrown was as big as a city block.  I turned to see the center of the light turn yellow/orange with drips of the same color. Then it was gone.  My sister, who was looking the opposite direction, saw bright colorful lights illuminate her field of vision. She notes the absence of sound accompanying the lights.
