Fast moving light overhead various days and disappears and changes direction.;2012-08-06 04:00:00;5 minutes;fast moving light overhead various days and disappears and changes direction As seen often in this area, a small light moving fast overhead..most times disappears after few minutes. I've seen them change direction.  They fly.overhead on different days different directionss not always same route.  My.girlfriend and I have seen them disappear.  Always at night. Can this be. Satellites?  I've also seenphoenix lights  redish line of lights on trip.  Moving very slowly.  Thought they were lights on a mountain. I've seen more than this.;46.733090079365;-116.990001587302
Bright 'light-on-a-rheostat' in eastern sky.;2015-04-19 03:45:00;seconds per event;Bright 'light-on-a-rheostat' in eastern sky Between 3:30--4AM, saw two separate instances of 'lights in the sky,' while facing east from Hwy 95, on the north end Moscow, Idaho. The first instance drew my attention since the light was very bright and seemed to be like a light on a rheostat:  first being not-visible, becoming very bright, then becoming not-visible again. There was also very little movement of travelv across the sky. It was hard to judge distance, but this seemed fairly high up in the air, perhaps 2.5 to 3 hand-widths off the horizon (if one could see the horizon from my location)  At first, i thought the light might be a plane with its landing lights on, making a very tight turn. However, the Moscow-Pullman airport is west of town, so i should have been able to track an aircraft with its landing lights on traveling East to West. And i doubt the regional airport is open that early in the morning. About 8-12 minutes later, i noticed a second light do the same 'bright-to-nothing' off to the East-North-East of the first light. This one seemed a little higher in the sky than the first, and it was not as bright as the first light. Don't know if these were bolides, but i've seen at least one bolide, which exhibited some travel across the sky before it faded. These lights just became visible, then faded, with very little travel across the sky.  If any. There were no obvious engine sounds associated with the lights.;46.733090079365;-116.990001587302
Moving star-like lights;2015-05-14 03:18:00;Seconds per incident;Moving star-like lights Location: Just east of Hwy 95 on the north end of Moscow. At about 3:18AM, i noticed in the ESE what appeared to be a moving star-like light about two hands-width above the roof line of the opposite building. The light traveled horizontally south-to-north for a short way before fading out. The first light was followed closely by a much brighter star-like object traveling in the same direction and altitude before, again, fading out. The separation between the two lights was probably two or three finger-widths. A short time later, at a lower altitude, i noticed the flash of another light with what appeared to be a reddish color. About 3:28AM, i noticed a dimmer star-like light traveling north-to-south about 2 or 3 finger widths above a tree top behind the roof line that i use as a reference which then faded out after traveling for a distance horizontally. 30 seconds after one of the local church bells tolled once, indicating 3:30AM, in the ENE, a stationary star-like object became very bright, then faded out. The color was LED white. At no time could any sounds be heard.;46.733090079365;-116.990001587302
Reddish/orangish light ascending very fast over Moscow ID;2018-08-11 21:10:00;90 seconds;Reddish/orangish light ascending very fast over Moscow ID I live in Moscow, Idaho, and my house faces west.  I went outside my house at approximately 9:10 pm Saturday evening on August 11, 2018.  I was walking down the steps of my front porch when I noticed two bright reddish or orangish lights low in the sky to the west.  One was where Jupiter is normally found at this time of year.  The other was at the same elevation as Jupiter but slightly further to the north.  Both were of nearly the same color and brightness. However as I looked, the light to the north of Jupiter began ascending into the sky. It was moving very quickly, so much so that I watched for only 2 or 3 seconds before running back inside to call my wife and children to see the object.  This was a strange event and I wanted others to confirm what I was seeing.  I was inside between 10 to 15 seconds.  When I returned outside, the object was still ascending.  The light from the object seemed to slightly pulse in intensity, getting brighter then dimmer every second or two.  My wife joined me outside but my children did not come out quickly enough to see it. As my wife and I watched, the object moved overhead in the sky as if it was now traveling toward the east.  The rate of ascent seemed constant but very fast for an object that was clearly so far away.  We heard no sound associated with the object. As it began to move overhead, it started to flicker more significantly than before.  It pulsed brighter than much dimmer than before three or four times, then simply faded from our view.  If the object was still overhead, it was no longer giving off any light. From my first view of the object to its disappearance was no more than 90 seconds. It was the single strangest thing I've ever seen.;46.733090079365;-116.990001587302
Object moving across sky west to east that was changing colors: red, yellow, green, blue, white.;2021-07-07 01:23:00;30 min;Object moving across sky west to east that was changing colors: red, yellow, green, blue, white. Looking North, Object moving across the sky west to east. Object was changing colors and seemed to be fading in and out. Green, yellow, red, blue, orange and white.  Moving so slowly across the sky thought it might be a star with atmosphere causing visual color morphing  but was moving wrong direction to be a star.;46.733090079365;-116.990001587302
