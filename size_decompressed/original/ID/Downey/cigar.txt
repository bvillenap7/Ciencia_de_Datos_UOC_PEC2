The silver shiny object.;2006-03-14 14:00:00;15 min;The silver shiny object. I was driving my car down a remote road in a red rock canyon.  It was partly cloudy day.  I was driving slow trying observe some deer in a desert area.  My eye caught a flash in the sky.  I looked up as i was driving thinking it was a reflexion of a plane.  The I saw a oval cigar shaped object moving about the same speed as my vehicle.  I observed this object as a silver shiny abject.  Then I though there was no such plane that had this kind of shine to it.  I stopped the vehicle to look at this more in detail.  I had a pair of binoculars.  When observing this alien aircraft through binoculars I could see that it was huge. It was really at a high elevation. I could see what look like several windows on the side of this thing.  What I didn't understand was how it was flying through the air at this speed and shape.  I came to determination that what ever this was I could not identify.   I stood there and observed for a couple of minute and at instant it speed grew and then vanished.  I don't really talk to people about this because they would prob. think I was high or crazy.
