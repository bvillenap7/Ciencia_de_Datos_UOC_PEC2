They looked like small stars or satelites or airplanes (?).  I thought that they would collide into each other, except at the point of contact, they each circled around each other and flew off in opposite directions in a 45 degree angle.  I could not believe it and it took me a long time to realize what really happened at the time.  I still don't understand why no one else witnessed this event, but I thought I should report it.  Sorry it took so long. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD));43.3046;-112.1631
