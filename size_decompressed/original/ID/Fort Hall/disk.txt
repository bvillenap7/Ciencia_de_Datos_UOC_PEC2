silver disk hovering above house;2010-05-08 12:45:00;1to 2 minutes;silver disk hovering above house Driving home on old highway also known as yellowstone, looked over and saw disk hovering over a house about a mile and a half away.  Looked to be the same size as the house, silver in color with a rainbow effect around it.  The effect was like heat waves you see on the road in the summer time.  I watched it until I went around a bend in the road with trees that blocked my view.  When I could see the area again it was gone.;43.0405;-112.4328
