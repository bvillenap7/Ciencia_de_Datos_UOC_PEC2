Brite lite in sky over southern Idaho.;2001-10-19 22:05:00;7-8 minutes;Brite lite in sky over southern Idaho. Thought the brite lite was a planet - in fact thought it was Mars by its color, it was an orange white lite - never moved - just stayed in one spot for 7 to 8 minutes.  Then real slowly the lite went out.  there was no evidence of aircraft or balloons.;42.7584;-114.7206
Bright red/orange lights move into diagonal formation;2009-01-31 21:00:00;10-15 minutes;Bright red/orange lights move into diagonal formation My three friends and I were driving about on the country roads out north of Wendell close to the highway that leads to Hagarman when we spotted a very bright light in the sky to the south of us.  It got very bright and then disappeared, which it did a few times until it stayed bright.  (My radar detector went off saying K band like crazy each time that the light appeared and then would stop after it disappeared.)   I have grown up in this area and my radar does not usually go off in that area and it didnt go off the next day when I went back to the same spot so it must've been picking up something that was emitted from the light.  It would also be worthy to note that this light was very close to the ground, and from my perspective I would say it was no higher than a three story building.)   Then, from the original light, came three others that branched out into a diagonal line formation, the lowest light being at the right and the highest at the left...somewhat like this -> \  (we had no idea that there was other lights behind the first until they appeared it was as if they were turned off until they came into action).   These lights were redish orange and hovered in place.  When they moved into the diagonal formation it was precise and quick.  The entire sighting happened over a ten minute period or so, and then the lights just disappeared.   After waiting around for about an hour for the lights to reappear we gave up looking and went home.  We all got a very good look at these lights and there is no way that they could have been any sort of aircraft.  Also, I would like to state that my friends and I had/have been noticing very similar lights in the sky that would become very bright and then disappear but this sighting is the only one in which the lights moved about into a formation.  P.S. The reason that I havent put this on here until now is because i had no idea that this website existed!!!  We were all very freaked out and the whole radar detector thing made it even more eerie!;42.7584;-114.7206

Amber lights appearing in the skies over Wendell, ID 8:00PM 02/02/2010;2010-02-02 20:00:00;20 min approx.;Amber lights appearing in the skies over Wendell, ID 8:00PM 02/02/2010 My friends and I were heading west on interstate 84 when we observed a string of round amber lights, one appearing after another at a diagonal upward angle to the last, just ahead of us seeming to be oriented somewhere over the farmland between Wendell and the Bob Barton road. We decided to try and get closer for a better look but since it was dark our phone cameras were insufficient for pictures. We witnessed the object(s) a few more times, each time rerouting our course adjusting for the change in position of the object. Finally we gave up the chase after seeing no other signs of the object for over ten minutes.  Also, its important to note that as one light would go out another would appear. Sometimes the string would get to be three or four lights in a diagonal upward row. I have witnessed this before, but my last encounter I owned a radar detector. Each time that the lights would appear, my radar detector would go off as if someone had just shot me with a radar gun. Full blast. I no longer have the detector however, as it broke a few months ago.
