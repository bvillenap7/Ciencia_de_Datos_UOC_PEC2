I was looking up at the sky for falling stars and I noticed the planet Venus (at least I think it was Venus) to my right (South). Then as I turned to look in front of me (East) I noticed a very brilliant scintillating round, kind of almost diamond shaped looking object. It was very bright (like lights through a crystal) and colorful red, blue, yellow, purple and green. I stared at this object for a little while and I noticed it began to move rather slowly then stop( it moved a distance of about 24 inches if I measured the distance an arms length in front of my eyes) it also would get brighter then dimmer. I thought it was a weird sort of star at first until it moved, what really freaked me out however was what I saw next, something caught my eye to the right (South) not to far away from the position of the planet Venus. This was a small bright pure whitish blue light which was moving toward me and at a low altitude almost to the top of a tall tree in my neighbors yard. This light was round, about 6' in diameter and very bright. It was able to start and stop at incredible speed it was moving side to side sometimes in a circular motion starting and stopping like it was looking for something? It stopped almost over where I was at I was scared somewhat by this time because I thought I was losing my mind and I did not know what this thing was and it was coming toward me! The light stopped almost over my position for about 1 minute maybe a minute and a half. Then it began to move East in the same type of start/stop motion I described this is where it got weirder it moved right into the big scintillating thing and came out like twice moving around the larger object. Then it went back into it and the larger object then slowly moved off to the Southeast until it was out of sight. I have not told any of my friends except one because I thought they would think I was! a nut or something! The friend I did tell knows I am not crazy and I think she accepts the possibility of life elsewhere. She is more open minded than I or was I don't know what to think about what I saw but it really shook me up. By the way I have a highly technical occupation am a college graduate and have gone to many an airshow. I have logged quite a few hours flying and have seen aircraft, satellites, balloons and falling stars on many an occasion both day and night, these things were not like anything I have ever seen fly before. I wonder if a human pilot would have even been able to endure the acceleration/deceleration and turns the smaller object made? The G's would have been pretty scary from what I saw! Anyhow that is my story.;42.8790820895523;-112.444714179105
