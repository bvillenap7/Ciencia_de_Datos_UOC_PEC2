I witnessed what at first looked like a airplane,the object turned or rolled, at this time it looked long shaped or cigar shaped, then it rolled to the right showing a oval shape, silver in color. the sun caught it just right and it reflected the sunlight. then turn upward and within a secound or two it faded out.
