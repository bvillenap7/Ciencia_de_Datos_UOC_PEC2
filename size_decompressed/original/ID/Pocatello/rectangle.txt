I have never seen anything like this before.  ((NUFORC Note:  Report from very experienced pilot.  PD));2002-06-24 20:00:00;15 seconds;I have never seen anything like this before. Proceeding to Pocatello, Idaho, from Salt Lake City, in early evening, a craft crossed my path well below me.  It appeared to be contouring around the mountains and headed generally east.   I asked Salt Lake Center if they had traffic in my area and they stated that there was none. I was flying a Cessna 208 and have 54 years of aviation experience (23 military and 31 civil).  The craft had the general appearance of the  space shuttle (no wings observed). No lights were observed on the craft.;42.8790820895523;-112.444714179105
