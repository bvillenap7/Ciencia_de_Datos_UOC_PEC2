It was so high up in the sky that at first I thought it looked like a star,but it moved in an eradic north easterly direction.  The elevation of the object that I saw was to high for an aircraft. I watched the object for app. 10 min. until my husband came home and looked at it to.  He saw the object when came home and told me he had seen an object similar to it about 6 years ago. We watched the object for a few minutes longer and went inside because it was too cold to stay out and watch the object.;42.8790820895523;-112.444714179105
09/04/08 at approximately 22:10 hours a bright light moved West to East, zigged and zagged then disappeared. ((NUFORC Note:  ISS.  PD));2008-08-04 22:10:00;5 Minutes;09/04/08 at approximately 22:10 hours a bright light moved West to East, zigged and zagged then disappeared. On 08/04/08 myself, my wife and 2 sons were in our hot-tub, the time was approximately 22:10 hours.  My son said Dad look at that light there in the sky, see how bright it is and close that it is, just watch it, it will zig and zag even stop then disapear, I saw it the other night and my friends thought I was nuts.  We all sat on the edge of the hot-tub and watched this low light that was moving at a pretty fast pace then slowed to a stop, zigged and zagged, seemed to go south then back north then continued it's movement in the eastward sky.  Then just as my son said it simply disappeared.  My son said this same thing happened a few days before except it was in the Northern sky from our house moving West to East.  My sighting was in the Southern Sky moving West to East.  The funny thing about this was there no sound, just a bright, bright light.  No flashing lights like an airplane just an extremely bright light.  There was not a cloud in the sky to have it disappear as it did, but the funny thing was, it did everything that my son said would happen, from what he had experienced a few days before.  We are a very normal family and wouldn't report this for fun.  It was just something that none of us had ever witnessed before except my 22 year old son.  I know it was not a plane or anyway one that was common to us.;42.8790820895523;-112.444714179105

I looked at the sky in the WNW and saw what looked to be a bright constellation similar to the big dipper, but it was in the wrong part of the sky to be the big dipper.  The lights were about twice as bright as most of the stars in the sky and they has a definite red tint and didn't blink.  They seemed to be moving slowly.   I went into the house to get my camera and turned out the porch light (that took about two minutes) when I came out to look again most of the lights had dissipated.  The one or two that was left faded in about a minute.  There is very little air traffic in this area, I know they weren't planes.;42.8790820895523;-112.444714179105
Not quite a satellite.;2011-09-05 00:30:00;15 minutes;Not quite a satellite It appeared directly above our campsite during a labor day trip.  It looked like a satellite but darted and changed directions a few times in a small portion of space.   It finally spiraled to a halt and proceded to change colors between blue and red a few times before disappearing.

Countless, very tiny lights moving erratically.;2013-11-30 23:00:00;constant;Countless, very tiny lights moving erratically. Anytime I look up far into the sky I can see a countless number of very, very tiny erratically moving lights which are sometimes still, then shoot off in erratic movements at crazy speeds.  Sometimes I will see a poof like a small cloud and then one of these small objects appear, others are just there without the little cloud. I can see them whether it is cloudy or clear and sometimes in broad daylight.  I can see them most anytime I look for them.  They are in no particular area of the sky, just all over. Once in a while I will see what appears to be something shooting away from them, one here or there.  There are so many of them it amazes me!  I live pretty high up on the east bench of Pocatello where it is usually pretty dark, not many city lights to interfere with sight.  Some of these objects appear red, some white. I wish I owned a good telescope!  I will see if I can borrow one and report back.  These objects are extremely tiny as I stated, but appear to be all over the place up here. I would really like to know exactly what these are. They are far too tiny for me to photograph. So far, I have no witnesses but will definitely do that soon and have them file supporting reports.  My 23 yr. old son and my dear friend Melody are very interested in seeing these objects, so I should have their info for you soon.;42.8790820895523;-112.444714179105

I looked North off the top corner star on the dipper toward the North Star and in between that area of the northeast sky I saw between 6 to 8 distant, star bright objects coming into view quickly, one at a time and immediately slowing down as if entering, from a dark spot in the sky, like popping out of some kind of portal and from a left to right orientation. They seemed to come in at various angles into a small area of the dark morning sky, hesitated together for a minute and then vanished out of sight instantly. I have never seen anything like that before so I was REALLY surprised to actually see something like that in space while looking at that specific area. Definitely out of our atmosphere and in space but unbelievable to see them instantly appear as bright star! dots and then they were gone as fast as they appeared. I’m firmly convinced it wasn’t “Swamp gas, drones, satellites, balloons etc.” as NOTHING on this planet moves that quick. No drugs, alcohol or anything else could be the cause and I’m a very sane retired person, but after this report some may question that validity. Pocatello, Idaho;42.8790820895523;-112.444714179105
White lights popping into view, moving a short distance in the sky and popping out of sight.;2021-01-31 17:51:00;3 minutes;White lights popping into view, moving a short distance in the sky and popping out of sight. I was taking my dog outside and happened to look to the Northeast sky, about level with the telephone lines in the back alley, but far up in the distant still dark sky when the first white dot kind of just popped into view and was moving in a North to eastward direction for a short distance and disappeared, then another one would pop out into view moving to the same disappearing view point. They moved faster than a plane or orbiting object that I’ve seen before, but somewhat at a slower pace or patterned movement, but not a drone if you can understand that. I counted about 6 dots of light and one (about the fourth in the row) appeared to have a red and white light to it (but not blinking like a plane would), the rest were just white dots of light. They seemed to all move in the same direction for a short distance and then popped out of view one at a time, as they were seen above the tree line but very distant in the early morning dark night sky. It was exciting to see but in! a different location from the last ones I saw.;42.8790820895523;-112.444714179105
