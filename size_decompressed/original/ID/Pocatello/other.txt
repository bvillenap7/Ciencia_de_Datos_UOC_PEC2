Recorded 5 seconds of long string of lights in the sky and then disappeared.  ((Starlink satellitessa??));2021-05-26 22:30:00;2 min;Recorded 5 seconds of long string of lights in the sky and then disappeared. My husband just barely left the house. He called me to tell me hurry up and look outside there's the UFO. I threw my shoes on grabbed a jacket and my phone. As soon as I went outside I seen a string of lights floating through the sky. It looked to be all the same formation, object, it looked to be all in the same line as to be one vehicle. I pulled out my phone and recorded I think 5 seconds before it disappeared in the sky.;42.8790820895523;-112.444714179105
