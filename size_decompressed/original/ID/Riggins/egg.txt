Large white egg with comet-like tail seen above salmon river at french creek.;1996-04-25 23:00:00;4 seconds;Large white egg with comet-like tail seen above salmon river at french creek. Some friends and I were camping at French Creek/Salmon River confluence. We decided to take a walk up the Salmon River Road to the East.  While walking, off to my left I notice light above the canyon rim.  I assume it is the moon until I look in front of me and see the moon beginning to rise to the east.  I immediately turn to look at what it might be. I was astounded and was shouting at my friends to look and I immediately started running back down the road to get a clearer view since it was slightly obscured by trees.  I watched it for a few seconds while running and had to look back  at the road to see where I was running and looked back and it was gone. What I and one other observed was a craft that looked like a massive glowing white oval/egg cocked at a 45 degree angle and slowly moving toward earth.  From my perspective it was 1 1/2 times bigger than the moon but its distance from me is unknown and would guess at least a mile.  The craft emitted a mis! ty, comet-like tail that was white with slight electric blue like tinges to it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD));45.397;-116.3006
