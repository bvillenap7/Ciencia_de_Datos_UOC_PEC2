Large slow moving fireball seen in North central Idaho;2000-07-21 22:10:00;2-3 seconds;Large slow moving fireball seen in North central Idaho While camping along the salmon river in north central Idaho, I saw a fire ball moving slowly from south to north for a couple of seconds, then was gone over the horizon.  The fireball was yellow-orange, but appeared to have a blue halo arounf the core of the fire ball. The fireball was in the same attitude as the big dipper and moved parallel tthe big dipper.  The length of the fireball was also consistent with the length of the big dipper.  The firebeall moved very slowly compared to a shooting star and had a very long and very bright tail behind it. It is hard to judge the distance it was away from mynlocation, but I heard no sound nor anything that would indicate impact near my location. Since the event was of such short duration, its hard to describe further. Please feel free to call me and leave a message at ((number deleted)).  I will return your call;45.397;-116.3006
