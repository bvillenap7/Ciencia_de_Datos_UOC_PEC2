Weird things happening in the mountians of northern Idaho.;2005-06-28 02:00:00;1 minute;Weird things happening in the mountians of northern Idaho. I was camping just a few miles to the east of Mullan when I saw a large flash, beings i was well away from any houses or even the freeway, i looked outside to see what made the flash. I saw a fireball object going just over a mountian and not even 10 seconds later, i saw 3 lights in a triangle formation go over where i was camping. The object was solid because it blocked the stars overhead. It was extremely close to the ground because i could feel something like a light breeze only when the object was overhead and when the object passed, the breeze was gone. There were no sounds or anything other then a slight woosh sound as it went over head. I got out my camera to see if i could get a picture and the batteries were completely dead, although they had been replaced earlier that day. Once the object went over the valley below where i was camping, the camera suddenly came back on and the batteries were full. My friend who was camping with me saw the object too and decided that we should go home as soon as the sun came up and i said that it sounded like a good plan. When the sun came up, i went to my car and saw that there were weird markings on the dust on the back window. The looked like someone had taken only 3 fingers and made marks on the back window.;47.4734;-115.7958
