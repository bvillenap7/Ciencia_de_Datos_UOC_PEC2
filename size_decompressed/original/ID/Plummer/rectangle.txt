Bright orange object over Northern Idaho.;2009-07-04 21:49:00;1 minute 45 seconds;Bright orange object over Northern Idaho. At approximately 9:45 p.m. on July 4th, we were in the back yard enjoying all the fireworks in the neighborhood, when an object with a bright orange light in the front was observed, which we all at first mistook for fireworks. It was maintaining a constant speed, and we had time to get binoculars and observe it to be a black object with an orange leading edge. This sighting lasted approximately one minute and 45 seconds, the time it took from 90 degrees when we noticed it, until it passed over the horizon. It was a constant speed going from South to North on a path toward Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. From the ground where we were sitting, the object was observed approximately 45 degrees above the eastern horizon. Amazing, no sound, and through binoculars as it approached the horizon it appeared to be a black object with the bright orange light leading it. The orange light dissipated as it neared the northern horizon. We were so amazed that we didn't even think to try to get video footage or other images other than observing it through binoculars... We can be contacted for more information if necessary. This was not fireworks, a meteor, nor aircraft. Thank you.;47.3296;-116.8609
