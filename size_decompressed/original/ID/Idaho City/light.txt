bright light that  vanishes;1999-09-12 20:00:00;3-4 minutes;bright light that  vanishes One night I was walking to the store. It was dark, clear skies, around 8:00p.m.  I noticed a bright light out of my perifial vison.  At first I thought it was the MIR but, it seemed brighter than usual, and was out of position. I still had not looked directly at it. I thought to myself, something is not right, at that moment I looked straight at it.  It got brighter for a moment than started to move away at a high rate of speed .  It moved in a direction so that it got smaller, and smaller and than just disappeared or vanished. There was no blinking or colors at all.  It appeared to just be a very bright star.  This was no star, or plane.;43.8834;-115.708
8 lights emerging from atmosphere traveling same speed and distance in a straight path over Idaho City.  ((Starlink satellites));2020-03-21 20:22:00;10;8 lights emerging from atmosphere traveling same speed and distance in a straight path over Idaho City. We were camping in Idaho City (we being 4 friends), over at Grimes Creek campgrounds, the opposite direction from our local Airforce base away from light polution.  We saw 2 lights traveling at the same speed with a bit of distance between each other and noticed another one breach the atmosphere and fall into the same pace, distance and speed.  We proceeded to watch it happen 5 more times, all of the lights traveled at the same speed and distance from each other in a straight line not straying from their path, until branching off and dispersing into different locations.  Once they were there they started moving and dissapeared from site.;43.8834;-115.708
