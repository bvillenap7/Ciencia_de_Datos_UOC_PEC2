They were in the same area and would vanish.  No noise.   The most orbs seen at one time was 9 total orbs in a perfectly straight line.  They then vanished one at a time quickly.   Jets started to circle.  Cows were going crazy.   My middle son was asleep and started yelling let me go... MOM.   I rushed in and caudled him and he went back to sleep.  The event then ended.   I have a short video from my cell phone.;42.9347;-114.7224
