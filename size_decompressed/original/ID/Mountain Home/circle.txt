5 bright orange lights seen by 3+  Air Force personnel in Idaho;2011-08-25 21:30:00;30 sec;5 bright orange lights seen by 3+  Air Force personnel in Idaho I witnessed 5 bright orange orbs that I initially thought were a Fighter Jet popping counter attack flares however no jets were flying at the time, there is no way they would have gotten permission to intentionally pop flares here (given the dry climate and fire hazard),flares would look a little more fire work-like with many more lights and less organized, and if it would have been flares, as close as they were, I would have seen the jetâ€™s identification lights and exhaust.  They got really bright and disappeared in five different locations that were in relatively close proximity of each other.  One flashed, then 3 flashed at one time and one final light flashed.  Similarly, they brightened and dimmed like a flare, but much faster.  I know how to read the big dipper to find the north star, so I can tell you it was in the south-west.  It was one of the most unexplainable events I have ever witnessed.  The event left three Air Force personnel, including myself, speechless as well as, all others on the flight line who must have seen it too.

Looking southeast toward Twin Falls, ID, when I noticed an orange orb.  I didn't pay much attention to it at first because of the high volume of air traffic. It grabbed my full attention when the single sphere split into 4 smaller spheres.  Once my brain registered what I witnessed they vanished with no sound, or any type of visual evidence.  What a strange occurence.;43.1396;-115.696
orange lights towards boise idaho.;2015-09-27 20:40:00;5 minutes;orange lights towards boise idaho I was driving home from my parents house, when I looked towards Boise there was a very bright orange colored light in the sky.  When I turned down a road that let me look directly at the light a second one appeared.   I lost sight of lights behind some trees. I called my dad and he stepped outside of his house in time to see a light vanish.   I got off the phone with him and my brother had called him to say he saw the same lights and after the one light had turned into two.  They merged back together before vanishing.;43.1396;-115.696
