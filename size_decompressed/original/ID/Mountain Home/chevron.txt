It was a bright light that moved extremely fast across the sky towards my car on I-84 West.  As it got closer it slowed down tremendously and glided across the sky.  It look like it had 2 wings, pointing north and south, with fumes coming from the bottom of both.  The bright light was in the middle.  As it went past my car at about 1000-2000 feet above the ground, it disappeared behind me. I lost it, I couldn't locate it anywhere.;43.1396;-115.696
