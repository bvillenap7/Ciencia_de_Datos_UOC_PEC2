I saw an egg shaped light in the southern sky.  It moved from left to right, then up and disappeared.   Moments later, in the same direction, I saw 4 round objects in a diamond formation.  2 of the objects where blue colored, 1 was red colored, and 1 was orange colored.   After 30 seconds, the orange colored object shot straight up at light speed, and the other 3 slowly faded out of sight.;43.1396;-115.696
