5 Red/Orange Orbs/spheres flying over Mountain Home Idaho.;2015-03-06 21:45:00;10 minutes;5 Red/Orange Orbs/spheres flying over Mountain Home Idaho. I saw two pairs of red orange color orbs that slowly moved across the sky, about a 1,000â€™ above ground from the northern sky then towards southeast horizon until they faded away.   Then, three more orbs moved and passed in the same direction.  No sounds of propulsion were heard.;43.1396;-115.696
