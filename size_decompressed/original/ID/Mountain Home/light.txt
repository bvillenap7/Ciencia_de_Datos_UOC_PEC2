Straight Line of 10 “stars” seen in the sky to the southwest in western Idaho;2020-12-04 19:20:00;2 minutes;Straight Line of 10 “stars” seen in the sky to the southwest in western Idaho Saw three stars resembling Orion’s Belt to the south west. Confused, I kept my eye on it and gazed in awe as several more stars periodically appeared, all forming a straight line. At its peak, it looked like about 10 stars angling from left to right, all in a straight line. I was driving on 84 going west and was waiting for an exit to stop and take a picture, but one by one the “stars” faded away as I drove.;43.1396;-115.696
