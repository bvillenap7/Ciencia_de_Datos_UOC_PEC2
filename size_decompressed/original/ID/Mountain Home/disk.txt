Four colored objects moving in formation, moving in unison.;2015-05-01 00:07:00;3 minutes;Four colored objects moving in formation, moving in unison. When my 15 year old son saw what he thought was a UFO, he asked me out into the yard to look.  We saw a white disk type object in the sky in  the southeast direction from Mountain Home, Idaho.  This object moved slowly to the left, then faded out.   Almost immediately after that object disappeared, we saw four different colored round objects in the same general direction.  There was one blue, one red, and two orange.  The four objects appeared to be in some type of formation, moving in unison to right right then back to the left.   After about two minutes, the four objects quit moving.  Then, all of a sudden, one of the orange objects shot straight up toward the sky at an indescribable speed.  The object moved so fast that there appeared to be an orange tail behind it.  The remaining three objects slowly dimmed out of site right after the orange one took off.;43.1396;-115.696
Saucer shaped object with 18 red blinking light s along it's outer edge.;2015-05-01 00:07:00;90 seconds;Saucer shaped object with 18 red blinking light s along it's outer edge While observing the night sky toward the southeast direction from Mountain Home, Idaho, I was drawn to the western skies by a low humming sound.  As I gazed into the night sky, I saw a very large saucer shaped object that appeared to be hoovering less that a mile from where I was standing.  This saucer had 18 red blinking lights that went around the edge of it, and it is positively where the humming sound was coming from.   I stood there in awe as the object slowly drifted further west, disappearing over the mountains.;43.1396;-115.696

After seeing the oval and round objects in the southern sky, I saw another object in the eastern sky.  It was a saucer shaped object made up of 18 red lights.
