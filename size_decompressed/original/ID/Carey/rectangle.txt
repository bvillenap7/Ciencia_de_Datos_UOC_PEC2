As a skeptic regarding UFO sightings, this is not easy to report. We were traveling eastbound on Idaho State Highway 20, 14 miles east of Carey, Idaho.  The object was ahead of us at a 60 degree angle from the horizon and on a bearing of 35 degrees.  It appeared stationary for about three minutes and then was INSTANTLY gone. It was rectangular in shape, had no visible lights.  Since distance was impossible to determine, the size is anyone's guess.;43.2744;-113.8926
