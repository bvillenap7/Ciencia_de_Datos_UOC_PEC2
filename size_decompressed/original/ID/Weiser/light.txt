Pendulum, white light turning red as it got lower.;2013-10-22 20:22:00;30 minutes;Pendulum White light turning red as it got lower. Walking back to the truck after deer hunting with my son, we were enjoying the stars and then we saw an unusual pulsing light over the Weiser area.   We were 10-20 miles East, about 14 miles up Van Duesen road, North of Emmet.  It would sweep back and forth like a pendulum, like it was looking for something.  Every time it got closer to the horizon, it would gradually turn from white/yellow to red as it got closer to the ground.   Once it got really close to the ground, it would turn pure white and blink out.   Then it would shoot off North and gain several thousand feet of altitude in less than a second.  Going from red to bright yellow/white.   On some pendulums, it would continue to the North or South 'wobbling' up and down in elevation.   We watched it from 8:22pm to 8:48pm.  At 8:43 I called 911 to report it.  The 911 call did not connect to Payette County.  So I asked the operator to call over there and tell them to look up at the sky to see the UFO.   About 5 minutes later (the amount of time it would probably take for this to happen), the UFO dropped, flashed, and went out.  Not to be seen again as we waited for it for a good 10 minutes.;44.254;-116.9647
Bright light moving quickly across the sky and then dimmed and suddenly disappeared.;2014-08-15 23:15:00;15 seconds;Bright light moving quickly across the sky and then dimmed and suddenly disappeared. We saw a bright light at about 23:15 on 8/15/14 in weiser ID.  It it moved quickly across the sky and we think it wasn't a satellite because it was too bright, too fast and moving too straight.   It wasn't a comet because this UFO was going too slow and it lasted about 15 seconds total.  We had saw it about 10 minutes earlier and it was about the same, and it went behind a tree and it disappeared behind the tree.  It was bright, and the started dimming, and suddenly disappeared.  By the way, there were absolutely no clouds.;44.254;-116.9647

Craft was moving side to side for a moment, and then performed a swirl up and to the right of my vision. Then the light went out. Within a couple of seconds it lit up again and did the same swirl pattern, and the light went out again. Then it lit up red, then the light went out again. Then lit up white again and zoomed out of sight and diagonal right of my vision.;44.254;-116.9647
