It was larger than any star and fell straight down. Toward the last of it's descent, I thought it changed color, spread, and then fell behind the ridge directly ahead. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with this witness at length, and we found her to be an exceptionally good witness.  We find this report of interest, principally because the event appears to have occurred as the dramatic event reported from California and Oregon, but the flightpath of the object appears to be incompatible with the object seen in other states to the south.  The witnesses in Arco, ID, were adamant that the object they had witnessed was traveling across the sky almost perfectly vertically down.  This fact strongly suggests to us that it could not have been the same object seen elsewhere.  PD));43.6347;-113.3194
