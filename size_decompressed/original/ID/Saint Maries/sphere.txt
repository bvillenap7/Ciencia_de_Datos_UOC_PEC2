September 6, 2011  I never woulda thought this would happen to me.  But one Sunny day in Northern Idaho up in the mountains by a little town Called St Maries me and six of my buddies were playing on the St joe river up on a railroad bridge.  We were all talking and about to jump off and go swimming.  All six of us were standing on this tall bridges Cat walk when i looked up across the river and noticed the spherical object hovering over the mountain.  Yea i knew what it was as soon as i seen it. It actually shocked me and made me feel as if i was dreaming it up.  But no i yelled look and i pointed at the object but knowone looked because they thought i was being silly, but my friend that trust me looks up and sees the object hovering as well. Then everyone turned and looked and seen the object but as everyone started to notice the craft it started to shrink. The object to our point of view was about the size of a dime if u held it out infront of you. It must havea taken off at Not-Of-This-Earth like Speed. until it got so far away you couldnt see it anymore.;47.2995;-116.57
