Silent silvery-white cigar or blimp shaped craft spotted over saint maries Idaho;2007-08-29 12:40:00;few minutes;Silent silvery-white cigar or blimp shaped craft spotted over saint maries Idaho Not certain what we saw.  It appeared to have no wings and was cigar shaped, silvery white in color, and moved slowly across the sky.  This was not a narrow cigar shape, but more like a blimp. We watched it for several minutes as it moved on a westward heading (towards Spokane Washington).  It traveled at a speed close to that of a small single engine airplane, maybe a bit slower.  I cannot be certain that it had no wings, but that is how it appeared to both my wife and I.  It definitely made no sound, and that’s why I am reporting it.   I’m skeptical of alien spaceships, but I cannot explain this craft’s silence.  Visibility was perfect, as the sun was high and the air clear, and we were hiking in the hills above the valley.  If it had an engine, we should have heard it clearly.  There was no con-trail or visible markings or lights of any sort.;47.2995;-116.57
