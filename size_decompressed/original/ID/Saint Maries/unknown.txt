Satellite-like object seen moving from S to SW and away from Earth.  ((NUFORC Note:  Satellite??  PD));2015-05-08 00:00:00;10 seconds;Satellite-like object seen moving from S to SW and away from earth. My son and I were feeding the horses right at dark, and as they ate their grain and the sky darkened, I pointed out a N/S traveling satellite.  It was easily visible and traveled at a steady pace.   We continued to watch the sky for other satellites and I happened to glance back to where we lost the visual of the satellite (south) and I noticed an object that looked like a satellite but it was moving from the south to the southwest.  However, it was moving away from the earth, getting smaller and smaller, until it appeared to disappear into the stars. ((NUFORC Note:  Satellite??  PD));47.2995;-116.57
