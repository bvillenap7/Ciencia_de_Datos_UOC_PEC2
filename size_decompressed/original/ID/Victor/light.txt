Went outside to take the dogs out- super clear night.  Saw a bright light going really fast from the west to the east.  The craft stopped abruptly and started coming back from west to east.  It then stopped again and was zig zagging all over.  The lights would get really bright then dim.  We could almost see a tail of some sort coming from behind or around it.  At one point it got really bright and two smaller lights shot out of it!  Those lights moved in a straight direction and then came back circling around the main craft/ object. It seemed to have a spot light coming off it at different times.  The movement was sporadic- it's almost as if its the beginning it was heading for a destination and then it got there and stopped and several different things happened.  It was extremely odd and something I have never seen before.  It was crazy to watch it--we went inside after watching it for 20 minutes.;43.613;-111.1236
