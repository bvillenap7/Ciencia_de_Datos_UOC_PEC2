W Shape Formation, Meridian, ID.;2013-10-16 22:57:00;5 minutes;W Shape Formation, Meridian,ID Approximately, 2255 our small dog began to grow out of bedroom window.  When my fiance looked outside the window she asked if I could see a series of lights moving in slow but steady path.   When I first looked I was unable to see them due to reflection on the glass, however moving to a different spot was able to see the craft.   We then proceeded to move to our front room and look out a porch sliding glass door and watch the craft continue to move.  There were 8 lights in a W pattern, the lead light was white, the next 6 were either white or blue (I saw white, finance saw blue) and the last light was red.   The air was distorted like there was a solid object in the sky, however as it proceeded the lights spread out.   I was able to get one more look from another bedroom window where the lights had significantly spread out. Craft was moving N-NW (~335 deg) to E-SE (133 degrees) First window faces North Door faces North Second window faces East Lights appeared to be approx 1000-2000 ft off the ground Sound sounded like a hum of roter blades from a helo, but very quiet.

Red light formation followed by white strobe light.;2019-09-13 21:15:00;5-10 minutes;Red light formation followed by white strobe light. Was walking my dog looking East towards Nampa and Caldwell.  I spotted four red lights in a line that were tilted at an angle and they were quite white apart.  a man was outside sitting on his porch so I asked him to get up and take a look at it and I asked him if he knew what it was and he said he'd never seen anything like that in his life.  I then called my parents live about three miles away and have them step outside and asked if they could see red lights.  They confirm that they did and we're shocked at the way that they were moving and coming in and out of focus like they were going far away and then coming closer.and then a bright light appeared that started flashing like a strobe light following in similar vicinity of the direction the red lights were going.  At some point they all disappeared.;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616
