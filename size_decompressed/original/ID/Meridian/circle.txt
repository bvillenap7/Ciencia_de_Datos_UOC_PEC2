More than a dozen red lights travelling slowly towards North and then slowly together up in the sky;2013-09-14 21:00:00;15 minutes;More than a dozen red lights travelling slowly towards North and then slowly together up in the sky As we were driving West from Boise towards our home in Meridian tonight around 9:00 PM, I saw what it looks like red lights going slowly towards the sky. First I thought they were attached to a very high post for some advertisement or something like that since today is Saturday.  As we were getting closer to them they look like small red circles going North. They were very close together but they did not touch each other. Almost like they were connected by a net  I took my phone and decided to take a video.  My husband stopped the car so we can have a better view without getting or causing an accident. I don't know when they showed up, or how many they were from the beginning, but when we saw them they were about 12-15 and as they travelled North, they started to disappear one by one in the same spot until they were not visible anymore. When we arrived home, my husband decided to go outside to see if they were still visible .  He called me outside and they were all together almost like a bunch of grapes and they went up slowly up in the sky.  We took more pictures with our cell phones and I did try to take a video again but is not visible to the naked eye.  The pictures we took at home we can make them bigger and it looks like a big light in motion. I don't know if an expert with the right technology will be able to see something on my video. I can't make it bigger as the pictures can. From the time we first saw them until they went up in the sky, I would say it was about an hour.  We decided to come inside and check the local news but I did not see anything. Outside that light was still visible and it seems like 1 big blinking light to me, but my husband said he saw more than a couple of blinking of different colors (red, silver, white) In the pictures we took it looks white with blue around it. Thank you,;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616

Thought it was an airplane or some flickering Star that would go away.  But every night now for about 3 months there has been at least one and up to three UFO of some sort.  They fly in every direction and at hyper speed.  They like to do little flips and know when people are watching.  They dance in the sky and shoot from left to right.  It's become a ritual now, every time me and my fiance go smoke a cigarette we see the little alien we call it.  And we watch it and then go inside and come back out a few ours later and do it all over again.  We have had many friends over and they have all just sat and watched them too.   Very cool anyone else see these guys over downtown meridian????  Please tell me.  I think we are are being watched and observed. and I don't mind it.  Do you? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD));43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616

We saw a fireball a few years ago right down the street & talk about it all the time.  He started wondering if he actually saw what he thought because he was a few years younger.  He saw it small & I saw it as gigantic. Again,He saw a massive fireball craft traveling so slow above our shed he was sure he had time to run in the house to take us to the back. He ran in the house yelling come on, another fireball! He was shocked it already disappeared. Now he knows he has the gift to see them.  He has now seen them as much as his mother.;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616
