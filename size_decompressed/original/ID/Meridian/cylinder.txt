Mother ship size cylinder/cigar object with 6 lights moving west to east.;2019-05-23 01:15:00;about 30 seconds;Mother ship size cylinder/cigar object with 6 lights moving west to east. I ALWAYS look up into the night sky and have seen dot’s (3 ufos to be exact) in the sky that have maneuvered in ways a satellite and planes cannot perform.  However, this was my first sighting of a mother ship!!!  In the northern sky heading west to east I saw and object that was about 6 to 8 inches long from my point of view.  There was no sound at all.  It had 6 lights with the second light from the rear being slightly larger than the other 5, example:(oOoooo) on a cigar/cylinder shaped object and it was moving slightly faster than a satellite.  If this object was in low earth orbit, it was over a mile in length.  If it was in the inner atmosphere then it was at least a quarter to half mile long!  I wish I could tell the exact height in the sky to give you a better description of the size, but I just don’t know. I really hope somebody else saw this object in the sky as this sighting kind of freaked me out.  Something that big moving through the sky has had a profound effect on me as this was most likely a once in a life time event. Thank you for your service!;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616
