A fluxuating flaming orb moving across the sky.;2012-09-15 21:00:00;15-20 minutes;A fluxuating flaming orb moving across the sky. I was going home, traveling northwest in our subdivision and out of the corner of my eye I  saw this 'red flame rising'.  It raised to the tree line and then took off, crossing over the tree tops at a high rate of speed, heading southwest.   A friend was riding with me at the time and he too saw the same.  It seemed to be egg shaped and maybe the size of a car.  Red flame(s) coming from the top and possibly whiteish flames from the bottom.   We went inside the house and we were telling (2) two of our buddies what we had just seen.   Within 10 minutes the (4) four of us went outside for a smoke break and we saw the same object, in approximately in the same place and it again traveled in the same southwest direction.  This object made no sound that we could hear.   Our backgrounds:  we've all lived here in Idaho our entire lives,  Occupational Therapist, Carpenter, and (2) two of us work for a mortgage title business.;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616
