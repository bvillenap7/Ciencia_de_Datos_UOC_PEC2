The object appeared almost overhead, about 80 degrees above horizon, heading generally west south-west.  It appeared to be a satellite (of which I have observed hundreds over the years), similar in speed, tracking and intenisity of light (which was steady, non-blinking), until making several sudden, major course changes, which included coming to what appeared to be a complete stop.  There is an all-night service station/convenience store about 100 yards directly west of my location that is brightly lighted all night.  The object was bright enough to be easily seen, even over the lights from the C-store coming from the same general direction.  I observed no strobes, beacons, or sounds coming from the object or its general direction that might identify it as an aircraft. Boise's Gowen Field is about 8 miles east south-east of my location and there is a lot of military and commercial traffic arriving and departing nearly all day and late into the night.  However, there is seldom anything flying in the area between about midnight and 7:00 a.m.  I am a private pilot with several hundred hours of PIC time logged and recognize how both military and general aviation aircraft are typically lighted. The light given off by the object was silvery-white, not incandescent or florescent, and of the intensity I have observed from satellites over the years.  It diminished only when the object passed behind a thin stratus cloud layer in the west, which was the remnant of some small, localized thunderstorms that had been in the area the previous afternoon and evening.  The object remained visible through the clouds for several seconds.  It made at least 5 course changes of as much as 70 degrees during period of observation, but its overall progress of travel remained generally westerly.  The object faded from view upon passing behind more dense area of cloud layer and was lost.;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616
Bright white/blue light flying at high speed, then speeds out of sight.;2013-10-31 21:00:00;10 seconds;Bright white/blue light flying at high speed, then speeds out of sight On the night of October 31st 2013 I was driving on I-84 westbound last night when I saw in the SW sky a bright blue-ish white light traveling at a high speed horizontal to the ground at about cloud level (there was only one cloud and I saw it pass through it).  Whatever it was was of a pretty good size.  The light did not flicker/waver like the meteors I've seen, it was definitely at the altitude I said.  It didn't have blinking light like a plane nor any wings that I could see.  I saw it flying for about 5 or 6 seconds before it seemed to accelerate and speed off into the distance and then it was gone.  It did not burn out, just sped out of sight... A day or so later now, I've heard reports of my girlfriend's parents seeing something similar too, and there's military helicopters all around Melba, ID, where they shouldn't be.  What I/they saw was no helicopter...;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616

Bright/star-like light in high in eastern sky, seemed to sort of hover, then vanished;2015-04-15 07:12:00;10 seconds;Bright/star-like light in high in eastern sky, seemed to sort of hover, then vanished Facing east on Franklin Road at the intersection with Eagle Road.   Noticed an object high in the sky, position around 11 o'clock, at first thought it was a plane reflecting the rising sun.  Then object appeared to turn and get brighter (reminded me of Venus in the sky at night).   Realized the object wasn't moving like a plane would but more hovering in same place.  Also the sun was behind it, so don't think it could have reflected so brightly based on my relative location.   Then just like that it vanished and I could never find any sign of it in the sky again.

A light began blinking across the sky, a relatively big light compared to the stars in the sky.;2015-10-15 23:00:00;1 minute;A light began blinking across the sky, a relatively big light compared to the stars in the sky. I went to open my window last night because it was hot in the room.  As soon as I opened my blinds, I noticed a light in the sky.  I opened my window to get a better view of it: It was about the size of a porch light (when looking in the sky).  When I looked at it, it started blinking and began to hover East.  I'm not sure if it was some sort of aircraft because you could heard what sounded to be engines as it passed by.;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616

Orange amber colored orbs slowly drifting, approaching from NE, then changing direction to west, slowing fading out.  Called second witness (lives within a mile) who confirmed sighting as well.  Two airplanes flew by during sighting, one of which (a single engine prop) flew underneath the formation.;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616
Bright light moving west to east until to high too see.;2018-08-04 23:47:00;0.45;Bright light moving west to east until to high too see. There was a bright light that was about as high as a satellite, but was much larger and very bright, it was traveling from west to east, after about 45 seconds the light appeared to be moving in more of an upwardly direction until the light became too far away to see.;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616
