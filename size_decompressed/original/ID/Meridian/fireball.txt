Bright white tail burning east to west parallel to the ground.;2006-06-01 21:00:00;3seconds;Bright white tail burning east to west parallel to the ground. Not even sure it was a craft. I just know I couldn't identify it so it's a ufo. It could have been space junk but it was traveling east to west with a long, bright white tail.  It was running parallel to the ground at about 45 deg. from the horizon.  I'm just shocked it wasn't reported in the paper, or any word of mouth yet?! It was BRIGHT!;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616

It changes form and does not look like anything that is man made. when looked at through a scope, it goes from looking like multiple colors from further away, but when focused closer becomes many lights and is definately inside our atmosphere.  Our background is we are just regular people.  We saw something similar about 2 months ago that looked like an atom in the sky. these seem to always be below the moon (closer to the ground than the moon)the one we saw a couple of months ago was red and blue colors and was constantly spinning.  It looked like a giant atom.;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616
Buzzing, huge disk shooting fire upward in a perfect shape like a crown, disappeared like the fire went out.;2013-06-28 22:40:00;10;Buzzing,huge disk shooting fire upward in a perfect shape like a crown, disappeared like the fire went out My son saw something flying under the lights on the freeway.  He was so upset that I could not see anything at first.   When we got off the freeway I was trying to calm him down when he saw it again.  I told him it was a firework then quickly changed my mind when it flew 20 feet from us.   Slamming my brakes we sat in our car and looked in disbelief at this hovering, huge ball of fire.  The fire burned on the top and looked as if it was shaped perfectly like a crown.  The most intriguing part was the loud buzzing sound it made.   Right when we thought to grab my phone to take a picture, it quickly took off.;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616
The objects were a orange color leaning more towards the red side of a scale then yellow glowing brightly in a fireball/orb like shape.;2021-01-24 19:15:00;3-4 minutes;The objects were a orange color leaning more towards the red side of a scale then yellow glowing brightly in a fireball/orb like shape. We were driving on Linder Road to the village at meridian when my companion pulled into sawtooth middle school and pointed the 12 lights in the sky just sitting there. I noticed that they were grouped together and all glowing orange my companion called her sister and brother-in-law who stated they could see the same fireball/orbs in their area a couple miles away. A aircraft flew around the objects while we were observing. After a few minutes the fireballs randomly disappeared and could not be seen again. I am a counselor for the school district and my companion is a stay at home mother. My son is a science enthusiast who first thought it was drones or Elon Musk however after he did more research he has said that it could not be either based on my description.;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616
