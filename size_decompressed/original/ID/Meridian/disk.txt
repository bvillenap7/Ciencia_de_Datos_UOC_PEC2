My wife then and I where in total awe of this disc craft and it`s lights that changed colors, it was no more then 100 feet max. in the air, so we got a good long look at it on a clear late May night. About three months later our paper reported, that two county shriffs saw and photographed the same thing we saw in detail, there pictures were sent to sacramento, they were told they got lost, so the paper said. As I am older now I realize how little we really know or understand, about anything and I wish I knew more, I am not nuts, it never harmed us and it never changed my belief system, but for the fact we are not alone, nor as advanced in the technologies. Why can`t we be told and know the truth. ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.  PD));43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616

A beaming strong light shined on us and the object flew by.   ((NUFORC Note:  Probably an aerial applicator aircraft.  PD));2005-07-08 00:05:00;15 seconds;A beaming strong light shined on us and the object flew by. We were going back to Meridian ID.  We were driving along West Cherry Rd.   All of a sudden a strong light from out of no where beamed on us.  It was a bright white light.  The object flew right in front of us and past us in to a field.  The lights went out and a blue flashing light came on.  The object stopped and turned around and went back up in the sky. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness, and we consider her to be quite credible.  Please see the second report from the other witness.  Also, please see the illustrations from this witness, posted to the NUFORC homepage.  PD)) ((NUFORC Note:  We now believe that the two witnesses may have observed a turbo-prop spray plane.  We would like to express our special gratitude to Mr. Michael W. Hall, attorney at law, Edmonds, Washington, for his taking the time to travel to the site of the event, in order to investigate the issue.  Mr. Hall travelled to the site from the Seattle area, and both witnessed, and tape recorded the sound from, a turbine-powered aerial application aircraft.  Based on Mr. Hall's work, we now believe that the witnesses might have been brightly illuminated by the landing light of such an aircraft, after which it flew directly over their vehicle, as they drove along the highway.

I was approached by a strang flying light driving home in july.  ((NUFORC Note:  Probably an aerial applicator aircraft.  PD));2005-07-08 00:05:00;5 seconds;I was approached by a strang flying light driving home in july. I was driving home to Meridian, Idaho, with my aunt and her grand kids.  I had left Fruitland, Idaho, late on the 7th of July. The distance is about 45 miles one way.  I’m not sure exactly what time we left but it was getting close to midnight.  I took the Franklin exit off of Interstate 84 by mistake.  So I just headed north till I hit cherry lane road.  It’s a back road which heads straight into meridian.  There was no other traffic that night on that road and all we could see was a lot of open fields.  Most of the fields on that road were not in use. From out of nowhere a strange light approached the side of the car at ground level and then flew right over us.  It hardly made any sound at all. I could see 4 bright white lights that were round in shape.  It felt like I was being watched for a split second.  After it flew over the car it dove down into the field next to us and its lights went out.  I saw that it didn’t look anything like a plane.  It looked more like a long wing or saucer shaped.  I saw one light come on after the bright ones went out.  It was a small blinking blue light. After it had swooped down in the field I saw it whip around and jump back up in to the sky.  I felt lucky this thing didn’t crash into us and I just kept driving.  I looked back in my rear view mirror at it and it was just hovering above the trees. ((NUFORC Note:  We have spoken with this witness on several occasions, and we believe him to be quite credible.  Please see photograph of the wound that he found on his foot on the morning of the incident.  Also, please see the report from the other adult witness.

Over 2 hours long UFO hoovers nears Boise, Idaho skys.;2009-09-23 01:00:00;2 Hrs;Over 2 hours long UFO hoovers nears Boise, Idaho skys. Looked out bathroom window at 1 am on 9-23-09 and saw what i thought maybe was a plane on fire heading directly towards me, at quick glance. me and wife and 18 yr old son went into back yard and watched for about 30 min taking videos and pictures from couple cell phones. The object had green lights around the outer edge of the saucer shaped craft with red lights top and bottom, nothing flashing. The craft would linger there like a old porch light in the wind and u can see that in videos. My wife and son went back to bed after about an hour, I stayed up recording and watching. I was not getting the quailty shots I wanted so I called local news room KTVB Channel 7 in Boise Idaho and told them to look for it. I hope they did, it stayed for about another 20 - 30 mins after that I went and looked and could no longer see it. I live in Meridian, Idaho and view it in the southwest sky. I never really believe in UFOs but that was something funky,,, a UFO.... The weir! d thing is we have a airport near by, BOI, and never heard or saw a plane in the entiree time watched UFO.;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616
I saw military planes go after it!;2013-10-25 21:00:00;15 minutes;I saw military planes go after it! I was outside smoking when I looked at the south east and saw a dark saucer with blinking blue green and purple lights.  I tried to capture it on my phone but it was too far away.  As I stood there trying to figure it out, I saw from the east two jets flying towards the object.  After that the object seemed to fade away into the night sky, as the two jets just flew idle in the sky.  Craziest thing I've ever seen!
