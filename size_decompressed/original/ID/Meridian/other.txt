Object Description - White to Silver, shaped like a seed of rice, traveling a direct path from almost due west to due east. Sighting - At approx. 1700 hrs mountain time, I observed the above described object traveling at what appeared to be a very high altitude.  I detected no sound as it traveled across an approx. 105 degree arc in a straight line.  From Straight up, it was approx. 10 degrees to the south.  I observed the object through the arc over a period of approx. 10 to 15 seconds until it went out of sight.  From my location I first saw the object at approx. 45 degrees to the west and lost sight of it at approx. 60 degrees to the east. Background - I am a 29 yr. retired police officer presently operating a private investigative agency.;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616
230 to 250 foot wide Crescent or manta ray shaped object with no audio or lighting low altitude and high speed in Merdian idaho;2008-03-24 01:30:00;15 seconds;230 to 250 foot wide Crescent or manta ray shaped object with no audio or lighting low altitude and high speed in Merdian idaho My Wife and were sitting in out backyard hot tub talking. The moon was not visible, the sky was clear, there was no wind.  My wife noticed something in the sky and said look at that! I turned to see a very large manta ray shaped object coming from the South east headed north towards Ontario Oregon across Highway 86. The object appeared to be under 1,000 feet in altitude but over 500 feet in altitude and was moving at a steady pace and appeared to be gliding along rapidly with a wing span I estimate from between 230 to 250 feet. crescent shaped front end and had a protrusion in the middle of the back portion. It looked exactly like a giant manta ray with a short tail.  The Object was almost the color of the sky like it was supposed to be camouflaged but lighting from the ground made it possible to be seen, it completely blocked out the stars that would have been visible had it not been there and it's shape was determined by the outermost edges of the craft.  There was no noise as it came towards us, no noise as it was directly overhead and no noise after it passed by. It had no lights, No writing, and no visible fire from a jet or any sort of engine.  after it had passed I thought that it's color was so odd that it was like if you were to take a large mirror into high grass of all the same color and then witness the mirror reflecting the grass back at you from a distance - it would be hard to tell where the mirror was unless it was moving the Color was so odd that i believe the object may have been super shinny and was only allowing us to see its camouflaged surface, the flaw being fairly bright ground lights shinning straight up onto the bottom, and also the fact that a star you could see would not be visible as it passed between us and the star.  The object appeared to be gliding rapidly - it was only visible for about 15 seconds before it was too far away to see any longer.  That's all, I have not seen it since but I am keeping an eye out for it again.;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616
Shape changing object slowly rotating clockwise with tentacle like arms with bright orange light on one side.;2012-08-07 21:58:00;5 minutes;Shape changing object slowly rotating clockwise with tentacle like arms with bright orange light on one side. Initially seen an orange light approaching from the north.  The light stopped then began moving again but also began to fade in and out, after which a dark outline could be seen in the glow of the city lights.  I could see a clockwise rotation of the craft which was roughly circular, but had tentacle like extensions and seem to change shape. I could hear no sound from it.  It stopped almost directly overhead and ,at fist length, it was the size of a walnut.  The outline of the object suddenly began to get much larger and quickly became as large as a basketball at fist length.  At this point I felt as though my life were in danger and I sprinted for my front door ( I had initially went out to get my mail and spotted it at the mailbox )as I was sure it was going to hit the ground or stop directly above me. After making it in the house I waited a few seconds then began looking out the windows to see where the object was. I couldn't see anything so I ( slowly ) went back outside to see what happened. Nothing was around but I quickly spotted the same orange light back to the north roughly were I had spotted it originally.  At this point I decided to run back into the house and obtain my binoculars. Luckily it was still there and I was able to view it.  The objects orange light was emitting from the outer edge and looked like some sort of thrust, being bright at the source, then fading outward, not flickering like a flame, but more like light.  It slowly rotated around the outside but did not appear to affect its direction.  I could not make out any specific surface detail but their were things protruding from it.  I watched it as long as I could for about a minute before I lost sight of it. I don't know it this was a second object or the same one I spotted originally.;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616
Rope-like object over Meridian,  Military jets in the immediate vicinity.;2015-11-10 12:05:00;3 minutes;Rope-like object over Meridian,  Military jets in the immediate vicinity. While working on a construction site near Meridian, ID, we heard military jets over head which turned our heads skyward.  While trying to locate the jets an object caught my eye, but noticed that it was stationary, even as the patchy clouds in the blue sky passed by.   I quickly realized the object began to change form from an indecipherable glob into more of the shape of a rope or fiber.  The rope-like object was white but I could almost discern a slight black banding down the length of the object.  It slowly curled and twisted just as a worm would as the clouds (below the object) passed quickly, which ruled out the possibility of it being anything inflatable like a string of balloons etc.  The wind did not move the object!   About 2-3 minutes elapsed when the object suddenly began to fade and within 3 seconds, it vanished. After some research, i learned these sightings are called Sky Serpents and this was an exact stereotype. I discovered that they ! are very common and have have even shown up on some NASA footage.  I do wonder if the military gets were scrambled to intercept this object.  Their path was liner and didn't seem to engage, (basing on the sound as it tracked across the sky) but, the sound trail of the jets did pass in the immediate vicinity of this object.;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616
What looked to be a sparkling contrail was actually a massive illuminated ship that crossed the sky.;2021-05-17 01:20:00;~5 minutes;What looked to be a sparkling contrail was actually a massive illuminated ship that crossed the sky. It was something very long, silently flying across the sky and then looked as if it just disappeared into an entire different dimension. OMG! With the naked wire this thing looked like a sparkling contrail. Thatâ€™s what I thought it was at first for some reason or a meteor. It resembled a trail of sparking dust that something has left behind. Thankfully, I had my binoculars which I always carry. It was a solid long black but lit up craft. It was extremely long and resembled more of a sparkling sword. Like a massively long ship with its own constellations. I took a picture with my phone, but it does not come close to what I saw.;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616
