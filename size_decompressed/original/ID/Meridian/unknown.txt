My boyfriend at the time, and I were driving home from the movies.  I was looking out of the passenger side  window when I saw something moving slower than a satellite and much brighter.  It was unlike anything I had ever seen. . I was trying to figure out what it was and before I knew it, the object got really bright and took off with lightening  speed and disappeared.  Immediately after that, my boyfriend yelled did you see that?!  We compared what we saw and it was the same exact same sighting.  We went home and watched UFO videos the rest of the night.;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616

15-20 craft with yellowish lights flying from S to N over South Boise, and Meridian, ID.;2015-12-04 21:45:00;10 minutes;15-20 &quotCraft&quot with yellowish lights flying from south to north over South Boise and Meridian idaho Friday December 4, 2015, between 2145 and 2200 hours, my friend and I came out of the Majestic Movie theater in Meridian, Idaho.  I noticed a lot of lights in the sky to the south over what I would say would be south Meridian or South of Boise, Idaho.  There were several lights that looked to be following each other in line, maybe 8-10 in the first group.  They were flying north and then several stopped, or hovered, above West Boise, while others continued in different directions.  There was NO noise.   I'm prior military and I've been around aircraft all my life and I know the different sounds from rotor-craft to fixed wing.  I stepped into a frozen yogurt place for a second and then came back out and saw another formation coming from the south.  This was the best picture I got as they left single file and began to make some odd formations.  The second group had 8-10 craft as well. I called Ada County Dispatch to see if they'd received any other reports of odd lights and they had not. They contacted Boise Airport and they did not have anything abnormal reported, nor did they have any radar information of 15-20 craft in the area. I contacted Boise Tower myself the next day and they confirmed that with me. Dispatch also talked with Gowen field and they did not have any night operations going. We have Apaches, A-10's. and F-15's flying constantly in the area, but none of those were in training that night.  I should also point out, there were no flashing lights on these craft, just the slightly yellowish steady light you see here. The weather was cold and at the moment, it was slightly overcast in that general direction. The lights were moving at a speed that would be typical for final approach to Boise except when they hovered.;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616
Rapidly flashing lights.;2016-01-08 23:40:00;3 minutes;Rapidly flashing lights. Violently flashing, bright red, orange and blue light that faded out to a pin point of light then grew rapidly again to disappear heading in a northeast direction.;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616
Eight witnesses of 3 orange glowing spacecrafts in triangular formation headed northwest.;2020-05-19 23:24:00;60 seconds;Eight witnesses of 3 orange glowing spacecrafts in triangular formation headed northwest. Me and some of my work colleagues were staying late after a social distancing barbecue. Coming from the Southeast were a trio of orange-amber lights emitting objects.  I quickly pointed them out and all 8 of us all stared dumbfounded as these three lights made their way across the sky heading towards bogus basin ski resort.  They appeared to be flying at a normal aircraft height however it was hard to tell.  They flew in a triangular pattern, like nothing I’ve ever seen.  A perfect V formation.  As a firm believer in science I can find no explanation for both the glow and formation these flying objects produced.  On behalf of my coworkers this is a report coming from all of our eyewitnesses.  I am hoping this was simply a trick on my eyes, and I’m sure this is probably the only sighting of these aircrafts.;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616
