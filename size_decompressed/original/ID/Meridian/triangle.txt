It caught my attention when the flashes changed from blue to white and sometimes red.  The flashes were at different brightness and sometimes the white light would even strobe.   I believe it was a triangle because there seemed to be a large mass not quite lit up on the side where I was watching.  The ship moved in fast motions.  Some points it would do a lazy sideways figure eight and it would begin to quickly fly one direction then would quickly change its mind and zoom back to its beginning spot.  It dropped little stars which I assume are ships, some underneath of it and twp shot out of the sides and shot up in an arch formation over the Meridian Speedway.   The big UFO with the lights continued to wobble in its spot while these very visible smaller ships went out if vision.  Then one of OUR aircraft with four big flashlights coming off all four sides seemed to have let some of its own ships go because I quickly saw two bright blinks in the sky separate from each other, but close to where the aircraft had just passed.  As I watched the UFO it slowly lowered out of my vision and made quite a light display along the way.  It left my vision at 6:16 floating over Middleton.  I believe it was flashing lights on our houses. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous provides no contact information.  PD));43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616
Multiple triangle shaped objects floating in formation.  ((anonymous report));2017-05-04 18:30:00;7 minutes;Multiple triangle shaped objects floating in formation. Roughly 35 triangle shaped objects seen in sky over Meridian Idaho on May 4th, 2017, 6:36pm, while at sports event at 43.615085, -116.337603.  From this location, the objects where in seen above in sky toward the southern direction. Objects were seen by multiple people at the event, including children and adults., which appeared to be slowly gliding across sky and fading from sight, after about 7 minutes.  In the picture (phone camera) they are white spots, but they were each visibly shaped like triangles.  The objects remained fixed in position between each other, but there were no connections visible to the eye. The sky was totally blue (cloudless) and objects could be seen quite well while lower in sky.  The picture was taken a couple minutes after first sighting, as they were higher in sky, and smaller in appearance.

Triangle shaped bright white object with flashing green and red lights in a triangle form hovering in the sky then reappearing.;2020-02-10 00:30:00;3 minutes;Triangle shaped bright white object with flashing green and red lights in a triangle form hovering in the sky then reappearing. Seen floating in the same spot one bright white light with flashing green and red lights in a triangle shape.  Seems to slowly fade away as if going very quickly directly away from me in the sky. About 30 seconds after fading away and becoming unseeable, it reappears again on the almost complete opposite side of the sky but this time about three times higher up from the ground, but instead of hovering in place it starts slowly moving slightly down to the left until it disappeared behind the roof of the house out of my window.  What makes things weirder is when I told my family member about it the next day they told me they kept having horrifying nightmares about aliens and waking up in a cold sweat, terrified to go back to sleep.  Planning on getting cameras to put in both of our rooms to try and capture more proof of extraterrestrials while we are asleep.;43.6318839041095;-116.415468835616
