I was 15 and we had gone to Idaho for my grandmother's funeral. I, my father, and three uncles/cousins were standing out in one of their fields talking about 2 in the afternoon. One of my Uncles suddenly said what the heck is that and pointed up to the NW. There was a dark, red cigar shaped object that appeared motionless in the sky. It seemed to be at very high altitude, perhaps spanning an inch at arms length, but I had the impression that it was very large. There was no contrail, no noise, and all agreed that it was no airliner due to the dark red glow.  As we watched, the object suddenly sped off.;42.624;-113.7971
