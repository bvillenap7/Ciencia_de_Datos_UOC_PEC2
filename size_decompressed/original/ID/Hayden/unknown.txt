UFOs may only be intraterrestial, military or other-than-normal occurance, not extraterrestial.;2004-04-15 01:00:00;10-15 sec;UFOs may only be intraterrestial, military or other-than-normal occurance, not extraterrestial. I reported this sighting about 4 years ago and have been reading the reports on your site since and only remember one other report - only one that resembled my incident. I am convinced that UFOs are only figments of peoples imagination and are not extra-terrestial.  I also, though not convinced, believe that any sightings other than imagined or military may be intraterrestial, other dimentional.  i believe that there may be those in this dimension that have the answeres and your site only is a diversion to protect the people from from truth that they are either military or other-normal occurances.  thank you for allowing me to comment.
