Two extremely bright, course-changing red lights were seen to the west of Hayden, towards Post Falls.;2014-03-16 00:40:00;4 minutes;Two extremely bright, course-changing red lights were seen to the west of Hayden, towards Post Falls. 12:40am:  I saw a very bright red light, reflecting a diamond or cross shaped light, moving in the sky above my neighbors' roofs. I live in Hayden and it was towards the west, near the prairie towards Post Falls.  It moved upwards at a steady, consistant pace.  It paused, moved back down, paused, moved back up, paused again, then moved to the right.  It paused for the last time and then instantly dropped out of the sky.   At 12:43, another bright red light descended at a steady, slow speed and then quickly changed pace and dropped out of site.   At the time of the sightings, the sky was fairly clear, but quickly following the sightings came a thicker cloud cover, originating from the area where the lights were seen.;47.7992;-116.7393
