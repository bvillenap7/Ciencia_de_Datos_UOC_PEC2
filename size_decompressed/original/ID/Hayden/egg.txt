Didn't note the exact time, but it was no later than 10:00.  I was having a morning coffee on the back porch, when I saw this egg shaped object over Hayden Lake.  It was not moving very fast.  My first thought was some sort of drone craft but it seemed a little too large for a civilian drone.  There was no weird feelings from seeing it, just normal curiosity.  It was not spooky at all.  I observe aircraft from my backyard on a daily basis.  This one was not flying any faster than some of the two propellor planes that fly over.  I was able to observe it for about a minute before it climbed into the clouds.  It was egg shaped, burnished silver and about the size of a pickup truck.  I could not hear any engine noise, and tried to spot wings or port and starboard lights without success. I can hear the engines of the planes for quite a distance and this thing was quiet although it was not very far away nor was it very high, at first.  Less than a thousand feet up and perhaps! 4 to 6 blocks away.   I am a retired oil refinery operator with ten years Military experience.;47.7992;-116.7393
