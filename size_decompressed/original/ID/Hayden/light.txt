BUT AS THEY FADED, THEY LEFT A VERY THEN SHELL OR RING WHICH FADED LASTLY.

Driving south from Hayden, Idaho to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho about 4AM mid-April 2002.;2004-04-15 04:00:00;one minute;Driving south from Hayden, Idaho to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho about 4AM mid-April 2002. I looked over to the east and three star-like objects (white light) appeared and hovered over the lake Hayden about 3-5 miles from me as the crow flies.  The objects were in a straight line and evenly spaced (appeared about 1/2 inch apart).  The objects did not travel with me, as would the moon, but stayed in their place above the lake and very sparcely populated wooded area between mountains.  I kept looking and within one minute the three disappeared, but slowly as though fading out.  The lights faded to a ghostly appearence in three seconds, and another three seconds dissappeared completely.  I am a skeptic about these UFOs, but believe that these sightings have to do with a spiritual condition about ready to be unmasked upon the earth prior to the coming of Jesus Christ.;47.7992;-116.7393
someone please report back to me on this case.  It is unusual, in that I have not read too many similar descriptions on your site.;2005-04-30 05:00:00;10-15 secs.;someone please report back to me on this case.  It is unusual, in that I have not read too many similar descriptions on your site. Predawn late April, very clear sky - that greenish-yellow light.  Looking eastward from the city of Hayden, Idaho directly above the Lake Hayden.  The mountains around the lake were black in silhouette, appeared three orbs, yellowish/white in a straight line, about one inch apart in appearance.  As soon as I saw them, I pulled over to check it out.  Within five seconds after I stopped the stationary lights/orbs slowly disappeared while in their same location.  The lights faded within four seconds, all at the same time and left a perforation circle for each which lasted one second.  Nothing was left in their place - no craft or smoke, just clear pristine air.  Please report back to me on this one.  Has anyone else seen something like this?

Brilliant fast moving light/ orb moving erastically then turned red and then dimmed and disappeared.;2019-01-26 19:23:00;4 minutes;Brilliant fast moving light/ orb moving erastically then turned red and then dimmed and disappeared. My daughter and I were leaving the house and looked up at the stars and there was a brilliant white light or globe in the sky moving very fast but erratically then it would just slow down almost to a stop and just stay stationary.  Then it started to move again fast and as it moved forward it began to dim then the light turned red then dimmed more and then disappeared .;47.7992;-116.7393
