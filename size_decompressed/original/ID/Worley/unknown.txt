Unexplained lights above US 95 south of Worley, ID.;2007-09-01 03:30:00;2 minutes;Unexplained lights above US 95 south of Worley, ID. I was driving south on US 95.  I was between Worley, ID and the rest stop on my way to Lewiston, ID/Clarkston, WA from Missoula, MT.  It was around three-thirty in the morning.  I’d chosen to travel at this time to beat heat and traffic.  There were no other cars for as far as I could see in either direction.  I was driving through one of the wooded areas along this highway when flashing bright lights in the sky started to descend downward.  I couldn’t make out shapes, but I knew it wasn’t a plane or a helecopter.  The light was a warm color, like the “golden hour” film makers and photographers talk about.  There seemed to be a dash of color at the edges of the light as well.  I kept driving toward it for about two minutes, wondering the whole time what was going on, when I suddenly found myself waking up on the side of the road, parked in a stand of trees, a couple of hours later.  I got back on the road and kept on toward the L-C Valley, since I wasn’t sure what else to do.  It wasn’t until I saw a story a few months later on KREM 2 news that I thought about sharing my experience.;47.4327;-116.908
