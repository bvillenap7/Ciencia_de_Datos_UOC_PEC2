Vertical Triangular object hovers high above ground.;2005-03-10 05:40:00;6 min;Vertical Triangular object hovers high above ground. Trveling south on Hwy 95, North Idaho, 5:40 PM, noticed a narrow, vertical, shining, triangle shaped object hovering in the sky.  We estimated it was approximately at 7 to 10 thousand feet above the ground.  It did not appear to be moving.   Within 3 minutes, a large jet, traveling south to north, did cross between the object and our location.   The object remained stationary for approximately 6 minutes and then just dissapeared.  There is a military base within 60 to 70 miles of our location.   We were south of Couer D'Alene, approximately 25 miles.;47.4327;-116.908
