Craft then folded wings to a shape somewhat of a Star Wars tie-fighter.  Back end looked like a W but middle of W smaller, longer outside wings of W formed to a &lt in front.  (Best description I can write as can’t draw on form.)  Craft then looked like it was launched off a catapult and speed seemed to increase until it was out of site.  When craft accelerated, no sound was heard.  Craft was going North. Spirit Lake, ID;47.9669;-116.8692
